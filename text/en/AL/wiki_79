<text>Campinas (, &quot;Plains&quot; or &quot;Meadows&quot;) is a Brazilian municipality in São Paulo State, part of the country&#x27;s Southeast Region. According to the 2020 estimate, the city&#x27;s population is 1,139,047, making it the fourteenth most populous Brazilian city and the third most populous municipality in São Paulo state, the fifth most populous municipality in Southeast Brazil, and the largest city in Brazil outside the metro region of a state capital. The city&#x27;s metropolitan area, Metropolitan Region of Campinas, contains twenty municipalities with a total population of 3,656,363 people.

==Etymology==
Campinas means &quot;grass fields&quot; in Portuguese and refers to its characteristic landscape, which originally comprised large stretches of dense subtropical forests (mato grosso or thick woods in Portuguese), mainly along the many rivers, interspersed with gently rolling hills covered by low-lying vegetation.

Campinas&#x27; official crest and flag has a picture of the mythical bird, the phoenix, because it was practically reborn after a devastating epidemic of yellow fever in the 1800s, which killed more than 25% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

==History==

The city was founded on July 14, 1774, by Barreto Leme. It was initially a simple outpost on the way to Minas Gerais and Goiás serving the &quot;Bandeirantes&quot; who were in search of precious minerals and Indian slaves. In the first half of the 19th century, Campinas became a growing population center, with many coffee, cotton and sugarcane farms.

The construction of a railway linking the city of São Paulo to Santos&#x27; seaport, in 1867, was very important for its growth. In the second half of the 19th century, with the abolition of slavery, farming and industrialization attracted many foreign immigrants to replace the lost manpower, mainly from Italy.

Coffee became an important export and the city became wealthy. In consequence, a large service sector was established to serve the growing population, and in the first decades of the 20th century, Campinas could already boast of an opera house, theaters, banks, movie theaters, radio stations, a philharmonic orchestra, two newspapers (&quot;Correio Popular&quot; and &quot;Diário do Povo&quot;), a good public education system (with the Escola Normal de Campinas and the Colégio Culto à Ciência), and hospitals, such as the Santa Casa de Misericórdia (a charity for poor people).

And the Casa de Saúde de Campinas (for the Italian community, formerly known as &quot;Circolo Italiani Uniti&quot;), and the most important Brazilian research center in agricultural sciences, the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, which was founded by Emperor Pedro II. Finally, the construction of the first Brazilian highway in 1938, between Campinas and São Paulo, the Anhanguera Highway, was a turning point in the integration of Campinas into the rest of the state.

Campinas was the birthplace of opera composer Carlos Gomes (1836 — 1896) and of the President of the Republic Campos Salles (1841 — 1913). It was home for 49 years to Hércules Florence, reputed as one of the early inventors of photography, photocopying and the mimeograph.

==Geography==
The area of the city, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, is ; of this is the urban area and remaining constitute greater Campinas. It is located at 22°54′21″S, 47°03′39″W and is at a distance of northwest of São Paulo. Its neighboring cities are Paulínia, Jaguariúna and Pedreira, north; Morungaba, Itatiba and Valinhos in the east; Itupeva, Indaiatuba and Monte Mor, south, and Hortolândia in the west.

===Ecology===
Most of the original vegetation of the city was largely eliminated. Like 13 other municipalities in the metropolitan region of Campinas, the city is subject to some environmental stress, and Campinas is considered one of the areas liable to flooding and silting; it now has less than 5% of vegetation cover in total area.

Trying to reverse this situation, several projects have been and are being conducted and planned, such as building corridors, and the regulation of the Management Plan of Environmental Preservation Area (APA) in Campinas. There are also several environmental projects to combat the destruction of riparian forests located along the banks of the Atibaia river, which has a high level of pollution. Today, Campinas houses the area of relevant ecological interest (ARIE) Mata de Santa Genebra, , established in 1985 by the city of Campinas&#x27; Fundação José Pedro de Oliveira and regulated by the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Institute (IBAMA). This is the now second-largest urban forest of Brazil, behind only the Tijuca Forest, in Rio de Janeiro.

The city also has smaller urban forest and reserve parks, such as the Bosque dos Jequitibas (installed in 1881), the Bosque dos Italianos (transl. Italian&#x27;s Grove), the Bosque dos Alemães (transl. German&#x27;s Grove), Guarantã&#x27;s Park, as well as the larger Parque Portugal (Taquaral Lagoon, transl. Park and Lagoon of Bamboos), &quot;Dom Bosco&quot; Ecological Park and Monsenhor &quot;Emílio José Salim&quot; Ecological Park.

In August 2010, for example, the rainfall in Campinas was only 0 mm. During the dry season and long dry spells in the middle of the rainy season are also common records of fires in the hills and thickets, especially in rural areas of the city, which contributes to deforestation and the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, further worsening air quality.

<text>The Viracopos/Campinas International Airport (sometimes referred to as São Paulo/Campinas or São Paulo/Viracopos) is an international airport serving the municipality of Campinas, in the state of São Paulo.

On 6 January 1987, the airport name was officially normalised to its present form. It is named after the neighbourhood where it is located.

It is operated by Aeroportos Brasil.

==History==
The IATA airport code of Viracopos is VCP and the specific city code of Campinas is CPQ. Sometimes both codes are used as one although there is a distinction between them in airline reservation systems: VCP, together with CGH (Congonhas) and GRU (Guarulhos), is part of the multiple airport system set around the city of São Paulo (code SAO). An airline that files services with the code VCP has flights displayed when passengers or travel agents request service from São Paulo, whereas flights filed with the code CPQ are displayed as service from Campinas, not São Paulo. A similar example is New York City (NYC), in which the airport codes LGA (LaGuardia Airport), JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport), and EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport) are used for the same city, although Newark is located in a different city and state.

There are two versions of the origin of the name &quot;Viracopos&quot;, which means &quot;turn (or overturn) glasses&quot; in Portuguese and can be metaphorically understood as drinking a large amount of an alcoholic beverage at once. According to the first version, in the beginning of the 20th century, during an annual fair, there was a misunderstanding between the parish priest and the residents of the neighborhood. This resulted in excessive drinking and quarrels, in which the festival booths were torn down, or overturned, during the confusion. The name &quot;Viracopos&quot; was later used by the priest in sermons to refer to the event. Another version says that, on the site of the present airport, previously there had been a bar where herders had regularly met to exchange views and drink (&quot;turn glasses&quot;). So &quot;Viracopos&quot; was first the name of the district and later of the airport.

The origin of the Viracopos Airport can be traced to a simple airfield near Campinas built during the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution in São Paulo. In 1946, shortly after World War II, the first runway was paved. In the following years, the airport began to take shape, with the construction of the first hangar in 1948 and the terminal in 1950. During the 1950s, it started being used by cargo companies. In 1960, it was improved with a 3,240 m runway, long enough to accommodate the first generation of intercontinental jet planes such as the Boeing 707, de Havilland Comet, Vickers VC10, Convair 990, and Douglas DC-8, and the airport was officially inaugurated on 19 October 1960, same day where it also received its first international flight. Furthermore, Viracopos Airport served (and still serves) as an alternate airport for Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport and São Paulo airports particularly because it rarely closes due to bad weather conditions (an average of only 5 days per year).

After 1960, Viracopos became the primary international airport for São Paulo, because the runway of São Paulo-Congonhas Airport was too short to accommodate intercontinental jet planes. In practice, however, the distance of nearly 100 km from Viracopos to São Paulo made it very inconvenient for passengers and airlines. As a result, direct international passenger service was limited, because most international passengers simply opted to fly instead to Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport and then connect to Congonhas Airport, which is located very close to downtown. At that time, Viracopos even appeared on the Guinness Book of Records as the furthest airport from the city it allegedly served.

The airport&#x27;s title as the main international airport of São Paulo ended in 1985 with the opening of São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, and Viracopos entered into a decade of stagnation, with all international and most domestic flights transferred to Guarulhos and Congonhas.

However, recognizing the strategic importance of Viracopos for the economy, Infraero, the airport administrator in 1995, started to implement a master plan of renovations aiming at the building of a new airport, focusing its efforts on the segment of cargo transportation. The first phase was completed in the first half of 2004, when the airport received new passenger departure and arrival lounges, public areas, commercial concessions and a new cargo terminal. The second phase of the passenger terminal expansion project was completed in 2005 and a new control tower was built, storage and processing facilities for the cargo terminal expanded, and the passenger terminal was entirely revamped. A third phase of expansion, which would build a second runway by 2013, was projected. However, since the airport was conceded in 2012, the deadline for the new runway was postponed until 2018.

Being the second busiest cargo airport in Brazil, Viracopos has 77,000 square meters (646,000 square feet) of cargo terminals, 1,700 square meters (18,300 square feet) for animal cargo, and 1,480 cubic meters (52,200 square feet) of refrigerated space. As a major import/export hub, Viracopos enjoys &#x27;express lanes&#x27; for courier traffic which are exceptionally quick and unbureaucratic by Brazilian standards.

Between 2008 and 2010, passenger traffic grew from 1.02 million in 2008 to 7.5 million in 2011. The airport can handle 7 million passengers/year. The number of flights offered has increased dramatically since Azul Brazilian Airlines made Viracopos its main hub.

In August 2009, the previous operator Infraero unveiled a R$2,814 million (US$1,482.6 million; €1,038.8 million) investment plan to upgrade Viracopos International Airport, focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The investment intended to provide a new runway, a new passenger terminal, and a new train route, with its main goal being to alleviate the air-traffic concentrated at Guarulhos International Airport.

However, due to legal and bureaucratic issues, the Infraero original plan never occurred. Since the concession to Consortium Aeroportos Brasil, a new investment program focusing particularly on the construction of a new terminal was announced. The phase 1 of the new passenger terminal opened in May 2015.

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Viracopos was considered to be requiring attention, operating between 70% and 85% of its capacity.

Following a decision made on 26 April 2011 by the Federal Government for private companies being granted concessions to operate some Infraero airports, on 6 February 2012, the administration of the airport was conceded, for 30 years, to the Consortium Aeroportos Brasil composed of the Brazilian Triunfo, an Investments and Funds Society (45%), UTC Engenharia e Participações, an Engineering and Investments Society (45%), and the French Aeroports Egis Avia (10%). Infraero, the state-run organization, remains with 49% of the shares of the company incorporated for the administration.

The facility encompasses 1,766 hectares (4,364 acres) of airport property and contains one 3,240m runway.

==Statistics==


Following is the number of passenger, aircraft and cargo movements at the airport, according to Infraero (2007-2012) and Aeroportos Brasil (2013-2023) reports:

==Accidents and incidents==
* 23 November 1961: an Aerolíneas Argentinas de Havilland DH-106 Comet 4 registration LV-AHR operating flight 322 from Campinas-Viracopos to Port of Spain after reaching an altitude of about 100m lost altitude, collided with a eucalyptus forest and crashed. All 12 crew and 40 passengers on board were killed. The accident was attributed to pilot error.
* 26 September 1976: a &quot;Serv-Jet&quot; Learjet 25 struck trees during an instrument approach to runway 14 in heavy rain, and crashed 1500m short of the runway. All seven occupants died.
* 4 January 1977: a Transbrasil BAC One-Eleven 520FN landed heavy at VCP because of an improper flare, causing the aircraft to bounce and touchdown nose gear first, collapsing the nose gear and causing a runway excursion. There were no fatalities among the 42 passengers and crew on board, but the aircraft was written off.
* 13 May 1980: a &quot;VOTEC&quot; Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander disappeared on a survey mission for Project Radam en route near to VCP. The aircraft was never found. Seven occupants perished.
* 13 October 2012: a Centurion Air Cargo McDonnell Douglas MD-11 registration N988AR operating flight 425 from Miami to Campinas-Viracopos lost a landing gear while landing on runway 15, causing damage to both the aircraft and runway. No injuries and deaths were reported. Following the incident, the airport was closed for 45 hours before the damaged aircraft was removed and the runway reopened. This caused a major traffic disruption with the airlines that operate at the airport. This also marked the first time Viracopos Airport had been closed other than weather, ending the airport&#x27;s 52 year clean record.

==Access==
The airport is located northwest of the state capital city of São Paulo and southwest of downtown Campinas, adjacent to the Bandeirantes-Anhanguera highway complex, which connects the capital city to the interior of São Paulo state.

<text>Ruth Elizabeth &quot;Bette&quot; Davis (; April 5, 1908 – October 6, 1989) was an American actress of film, television, and theater. Regarded as one of the greatest actresses in Hollywood history, she was noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic, sardonic characters and was known for her performances in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas to historical and period films and occasional comedies, although her greatest successes were her roles in romantic dramas. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice, was the first person to accrue ten Academy Award nominations (and one write-in) for acting, and was the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. In 1999, Davis was placed second on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema.

After appearing in Broadway plays, Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930, but her early films for Universal Studios were unsuccessful. She joined Warner Bros. in 1932 and had her critical breakthrough playing a vulgar waitress in &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1934). Contentiously, she was not among the three nominees for the Academy Award for Best Actress that year, and she won it the following year for her performance in &quot;Dangerous&quot; (1935). In 1936, due to poor film offers, she attempted to free herself from her contract, and although she lost a well-publicized legal case, it marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career. Until the late 1940s, she was one of American cinema&#x27;s most celebrated leading ladies. She was praised for her role in &quot;Marked Woman&quot; (1937) and won a second Academy Award for her portrayal of a strong-willed 1850s southern belle in &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938), the first of five consecutive years in which she received a Best Actress nomination; the others for &quot;Dark Victory&quot; (1939), &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940), &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1941), and &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942).

A period of decline in the late 1940s was redeemed with her role as a fading Broadway star in &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), which has often been cited as her best performance. She received Best Actress nominations for this film and for &quot;The Star&quot; (1952), but her career struggled over the rest of the decade. Her last nomination came for her role as the psychotic former child star Jane Hudson in the psychological horror film &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962). In the latter stage of her career, Davis played character parts in films like &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978) and shifted her focus to roles in television. She led the miniseries &quot;The Dark Secret of Harvest Home&quot; (1978), won an Emmy Award for &quot;&quot; (1979), and was nominated for her performances in &quot;White Mama&quot; (1980) and &quot;Little Gloria... Happy at Last&quot; (1982). Her last complete cinematic part was in the drama &quot;The Whales of August&quot; (1987).

Davis was known for her forceful and intense style of acting and her physical transformations. She gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative, and confrontations with studio executives, film directors, and co-stars were often reported. Her forthright manner, clipped vocal style, and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona which has often been imitated. Davis was the co-founder of the Hollywood Canteen, and was the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Her career went through several periods of eclipse, and she admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships. Married four times, she was once widowed and three times divorced, and raised her children as a single parent. Her final years were marred by a long period of ill health, but she continued acting until shortly before her death from breast cancer, with more than 100 film, television, and theater roles to her credit.

==Life and career==

===1908–1929: Childhood and early acting career===
Ruth Elizabeth Davis, known from early childhood as &quot;Betty&quot;, was born on April 5, 1908, in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Harlow Morrell Davis (1885–1938), a law student from Augusta, Maine, and subsequently a patent attorney, and Ruth Augusta (née Favór; 1885–1961), from Tyngsborough, Massachusetts. Davis&#x27;s younger sister was Barbara Harriet (1909–1979).
In 1915, after Davis&#x27;s parents separated, Davis and her sister Barbara attended a spartan boarding school named Crestalban in Lanesborough, Massachusetts, for three years. 

In the fall of 1921, her mother, Ruth Davis, moved to New York City, using her children&#x27;s tuition money to enroll in the Clarence White School of Photography, with an apartment on 144th Street at Broadway. She then worked as a portrait photographer.

The young Betty Davis later changed the spelling of her first name to Bette after Bette Fischer, a character in Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;. During their time in New York, Davis became a Girl Scout where she became a patrol leader. Her patrol won a competitive dress parade for Lou Hoover at Madison Square Garden.

Davis attended Cushing Academy, a boarding school in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, where she met her future husband, Harmon O. Nelson, known as Ham. In 1926, a then 18-year-old Davis saw a production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; with Blanche Yurka and Peg Entwistle. Davis later recalled, &quot;The reason I wanted to go into theater was because of an actress named Peg Entwistle.&quot; Bette Davis interviewed with Eva Le Gallienne to be a student at her 14th Street theater. However, she felt Davis was not serious enough to attend her school, and described her attitude as &quot;insincere&quot; and &quot;frivolous&quot;.

Davis auditioned for George Cukor&#x27;s stock theater company in Rochester, New York. Though he was not very impressed, he gave Davis her first paid acting assignment – a one-week stint playing the part of a chorus girl in the play &quot;Broadway&quot;. Ed Sikov sources Davis&#x27;s first professional role to a 1929 production by the Provincetown Players of Virgil Geddes&#x27; play &quot;The Earth Between&quot;; however, the production was postponed by a year. In 1929, Davis was chosen by Blanche Yurka to play Hedwig, the character she had seen Entwistle play in &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;. After performing in Philadelphia, Washington, and Boston, she made her Broadway debut in 1929 in &quot;Broken Dishes&quot; and followed it with &quot;Solid South&quot;.

===1930–1936: Early years in Hollywood===
After appearing on Broadway in New York, the 22-year-old Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930 to screen test for Universal Studios. She was inspired to pursue a career as a film actress after seeing Mary Pickford in &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;. Davis and her mother traveled by train to Hollywood. She later recounted her surprise that no-one from the studio was there to meet her. In fact, a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw no-one who &quot;looked like an actress&quot;. Davis failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors. 

In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, &quot;I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men...They all had to lie on top of me and give me a passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die.&quot; 

A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film &quot;A House Divided&quot;. Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the film director William Wyler, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, &quot;What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?&quot;.

Carl Laemmle, the head of Universal Studios, considered terminating Davis&#x27;s employment, but cinematographer Karl Freund told him she had &quot;lovely eyes&quot; and would be suitable for &quot;Bad Sister&quot; (1931), in which she subsequently made her film debut. Her nervousness was compounded when she overheard the chief of production, Carl Laemmle, Jr., comment to another executive that she had &quot;about as much sex appeal as Slim Summerville&quot;, one of the film&#x27;s male co-stars. The film was not a success, and her next role in &quot;Seed&quot; (1931) was too brief to attract attention.

Universal Studios renewed her contract for three months, and she appeared in a small role in &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1931), before being lent to Columbia Pictures for &quot;The Menace&quot;, and to Capital Films for &quot;Hell&#x27;s House&quot; (all 1932). After one year, and six unsuccessful films, Laemmle elected not to renew her contract.

Davis was preparing to return to New York when actor George Arliss chose Davis for the lead female role in the Warner Bros. picture &quot;The Man Who Played God&quot; (1932). For the rest of her life, Davis credited him with helping her achieve her &quot;break&quot; in Hollywood. &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; wrote, &quot;She is not only beautiful, but she bubbles with charm&quot;, and compared her to Constance Bennett and Olive Borden. Warner Bros. signed her to a five-year contract, and she remained with the studio for the next 18 years.

Davis&#x27;s first marriage was to Harmon Oscar Nelson on August 18, 1932, in Yuma, Arizona. Their marriage was scrutinized by the press; his $100 a week earnings ($1,885 in 2020 dollars) compared unfavorably with Davis&#x27;s reported $1,000 a week income ($18,850). Davis addressed the issue in an interview, pointing out that many Hollywood wives earned more than their husbands, but the situation proved difficult for Nelson, who refused to allow Davis to purchase a house until he could afford to pay for it himself. Nelson was able to enforce his wishes because, at the time, the husband had the management and control of the community property, which included the wife&#x27;s earnings, and the wife could not obtain credit without her husband&#x27;s consent. Davis had several abortions during the marriage.

After more than 20 film roles, she had her critical breakthrough playing the role of the vicious and slatternly Mildred Rogers in the RKO Radio production of &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1934), a film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s novel. It earned Davis her first major critical acclaim, although, contentiously, she was not among the three nominees for the Academy Award for Best Actress that year. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters, and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. Her co-star, Leslie Howard, was initially dismissive of her, but as filming progressed, his attitude changed, and he subsequently spoke highly of her abilities. 

The film&#x27;s director, John Cromwell, allowed her relative freedom. &quot;I let Bette have her head. I trusted her instincts.&quot; Davis insisted that she be portrayed realistically in her death scene, and said, &quot;The last stages of consumption, poverty, and neglect are not pretty, and I intended to be convincing-looking.&quot;

The film was a success, and Davis&#x27;s characterization earned praise from critics, with &quot;Life&quot; writing that she gave &quot;probably the best performance ever recorded on the screen by a U.S. actress&quot;. Davis anticipated that her reception would encourage Warner Bros. to cast her in more important roles, and was disappointed when Jack L. Warner refused to lend her to Columbia Studios to appear in &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, and instead cast her in the melodrama &quot;Housewife&quot;. When Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Citizen News&quot; questioned the omission, and Norma Shearer, herself a nominee, joined a campaign to have Davis nominated. This prompted an announcement from the Academy president, Howard Estabrook, who said that under the circumstances, &quot;any voter ... may write on the ballot his or her personal choice for the winners&quot;, thus allowing, for the only time in the Academy&#x27;s history, the consideration of a candidate not officially nominated for an award. The uproar led, however, to a change in academy voting procedures the following year, wherein nominations were determined by votes from all eligible members of a particular branch, rather than by a smaller committee, with results independently tabulated by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. The next year, A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream became the only film to win a write-in Oscar, for Best Cinematography.

The next year, her performance as a down-and-out troubled actress in &quot;Dangerous&quot; (1935) received very good reviews, and landed Davis her first Best Actress nomination and win. E. Arnot Robertson wrote in &quot;Picture Post&quot; that, &quot;I think Bette Davis would probably have been burned as a witch if she had lived two or three hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed her as &quot;becoming one of the most interesting of our screen actresses&quot;. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role, but commented that it was belated recognition for &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, calling the award a &quot;consolation prize&quot;. For the rest of her life, Davis maintained that she gave the statue its familiar name of &quot;Oscar&quot; because its posterior resembled that of her husband, whose middle name was Oscar, although, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences officially makes reference to another story.

In her next film, &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; (1936), Davis co-starred with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart.

====Warner Bros&#x27; legal case against Bette Davis====

In the spring of 1936, Davis asked Warner Bros. to loan her out to RKO to make &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot;. Warner Bros. refused, and assigned Davis to two films that were written specifically for her: &quot;God&#x27;s Country and the Woman&quot;, and &quot;Mountain Justice&quot;. However, as &quot;God&#x27;s Country and the Woman&quot; was going into production, Davis refused to work, and demanded a salary increase on her contract with Warner Bros. At the time, Davis was earning $1,250 per week. Jack Warner offered Davis an increased salary of $2,250 per week, which Davis refused. Davis&#x27;s agent, Mike Levee, said: &quot;She&#x27;s a very stubborn young lady. I asked her how much she wanted, and she said $3,500 a week, plus all radio rights and permission to make outside pictures. I told her, &#x27;Whoa, that&#x27;s too much!&#x27;&quot;

Meanwhile, due to Davis&#x27;s refusal to continue with &quot;God&#x27;s County and the Woman&quot;, Warner Bros. was incurring excessive production costs because the film was being made in Technicolor, and the Technicolor cameras were rented. In late June, the studio put Davis on suspension for refusal to work, and replaced her in the film with Beverly Roberts.

During negotiations with Warner Bros. regarding her salary and signing Davis for the female lead in &quot;Danton&quot;, Davis abruptly traveled to England with her husband, Harmon Nelson, on a &quot;vacation&quot;. However, in England, Davis signed a contract with British film production company Toplitz, to make the film &quot;I&#x27;ll Take the Low Road&quot; in England with Maurice Chevalier for a $50,000 salary.

On September 9, 1936, Warner Brothers filed a legal injunction against Davis in England which forbade her from appearing in film productions without their consent. While on a shopping spree in Paris, Davis publicly declared to the press that she intended to defy Warner Bros&#x27; legal injunction and make the film in England. 

On October 14, 1936, the British court held a hearing regarding the studio&#x27;s injunction against Davis. Mr Justice Branson issued his decision on October 19, ruling in favor of Warner Bros. Justice Branson dismissed Davis&#x27;s representative&#x27;s claims that she was an &quot;underpaid slave&quot; held under a &quot;life sentence&quot;, and ruled that Davis was in breach of her contract to Warner &quot;for no discoverable reason except that she wanted more money&quot;.

Davis was ordered to pay Warner Bros. $80,000 in restitution, and was also ordered to pay the studio&#x27;s legal fees for filing the injunction in England. The British press offered little support to Davis, calling her overpaid and ungrateful.

In 1943, actress Olivia de Havilland won a lawsuit against Warner Bros. regarding the length of time a studio contract could be legally enforceable, which at the time was seven years. In her later years, Davis would falsely claim in interviews that she set the path for de Havilland&#x27;s legal victory; however, this is grossly inaccurate. Warners&#x27; 1936 injunction against Davis was due to her attempt to unlawfully breach her contract to work for another production company because she and Warners were having a salary disagreement, and bears no resemblance to the de Havilland legal case.

===1937–1941: Success with Warner Bros.===
In 1937, Davis starred with Humphrey Bogart in &quot;Marked Woman&quot;, a contemporary gangster drama inspired by the case of Lucky Luciano, and a film regarded as one of the most important in her early career. She was awarded the Volpi Cup at the 1937 Venice Film Festival for her performance.

Davis&#x27;s portrayal of a strong-willed 1850s Southern belle in &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938) won her a second Academy Award for Best Actress. This was the first of five consecutive years in which she received the Best Actress nomination. During production, Davis entered a relationship with director William Wyler. She later described him as the &quot;love of my life&quot;, and said that making the film with him was &quot;the time in my life of my most perfect happiness&quot;. The film was a success.
This led to speculation in the press that she would be chosen to play Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, a similar character, in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Davis expressed her desire to play Scarlett, and while David O. Selznick was conducting a search for the actress to play the role, a radio poll named her as the audience favorite. Warner offered her services to Selznick as part of a deal that also included Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, but Selznick did not consider Davis as suitable, and rejected the offer. Davis, on the other hand, did not want Flynn cast as Rhett Butler. Newcomer Vivien Leigh was cast as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, de Havilland landed a role as Melanie, and both of them were nominated for the Oscars, with Leigh winning.

&quot;Jezebel&quot; marked the beginning of the most successful phase of Davis&#x27;s career, and over the next few years, she was listed in the annual Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money-Making Stars, which was compiled from the votes of movie exhibitors throughout the U.S. for the stars who had generated the most revenue in their theaters over the previous year.

In contrast to Davis&#x27;s success, her husband Ham Nelson had failed to establish a career for himself, and their relationship faltered. In 1938, Nelson obtained evidence that Davis was engaged in a sexual relationship with Howard Hughes, and subsequently filed for divorce, citing Davis&#x27;s &quot;cruel and inhuman manner&quot;.
Davis was emotional during the making of her next film, &quot;Dark Victory&quot; (1939), and considered abandoning it until the producer Hal B. Wallis convinced her to channel her despair into her acting. The film was among the high-grossing films of the year, and the role of Judith Traherne, a spirited heiress suffering from a malignant brain tumor, brought her an Academy Award nomination. In later years, Davis cited this performance as her personal favorite. &quot;Dark Victory&quot; featured Ronald Reagan and Humphrey Bogart in supporting roles.

Davis appeared in three other box-office hits in 1939: &quot;The Old Maid&quot; with Miriam Hopkins, &quot;Juarez&quot; with Paul Muni, and &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; with Errol Flynn. The last was her first color film, and her only color film made during the height of her career. To play the elderly Elizabeth I of England, Davis shaved her hairline and eyebrows. During filming, Davis was visited on the set by the actor Charles Laughton. She commented that she had a &quot;nerve&quot; playing a woman in her 60s, to which Laughton replied: &quot;Never not dare to hang yourself. That&#x27;s the only way you grow in your profession. You must continually attempt things that you think are beyond you, or you get into a complete rut.&quot; Recalling the episode many years later, Davis remarked that Laughton&#x27;s advice had influenced her throughout her career.
By this time, Davis was Warner Bros.&#x27; most profitable star, and she was given the most important of their female leading roles. Her image was considered with more care; although she continued to play character roles, she was often filmed in close-ups that emphasized her distinctive eyes. &quot;All This, and Heaven Too&quot; (1940) was the most financially successful film of Davis&#x27;s career to that point.

&quot;The Letter&quot; (1940) was considered &quot;one of the best pictures of the year&quot; by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and Davis won admiration for her portrayal of an adulterous killer, a role originated onstage by Katharine Cornell. During this time, she was in a relationship with her former co-star George Brent, who proposed marriage. Davis refused, as she had met Arthur Farnsworth, a New England innkeeper, and Vermont dentist&#x27;s son. Davis and Farnsworth were married at Home Ranch, in Rimrock, Arizona, in December 1940, her second marriage.
In January 1941, Davis became the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but antagonized the committee members with her brash manner and radical proposals. Davis rejected the idea of her being just &quot;a figurehead only&quot;. Faced with the disapproval and resistance of the committee, Davis resigned, and was succeeded by her predecessor Walter Wanger.

Davis starred in three movies in 1941, the first being &quot;The Great Lie&quot;, with George Brent. It was a refreshingly different role for Davis as she played a kind, sympathetic character.

William Wyler directed Davis for the third time in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1941), but they clashed over the character of Regina Giddens, a role originally played on Broadway by Tallulah Bankhead (Davis had portrayed in film a role initiated by Bankhead on the stage once beforein &quot;Dark Victory&quot;). Wyler encouraged Davis to emulate Bankhead&#x27;s interpretation of the role, but Davis wanted to make the role her own. She received another Academy Award nomination for her performance, and never worked with Wyler again.

===1942–1944: War years===

In 1943, Davis told an interviewer that she had molded her film career on her motto, &quot;I love tragedy,&quot; and ironically, until Pearl Harbor, she had been recognized as the American favorite of Japanese moviegoers—because to them, she &quot;represented the admirable principle of sad self-sacrifice.&quot;

In 1942, numerous Hollywood entertainment industry members joined forces to form the Hollywood Canteen. Davis and John Garfield were the driving force who were credited with organizing the canteen, along with the aid of 42 unions and guilds in the industry, plus thousands of celebrity volunteers from the Hollywood Victory Committee and beyond. The Canteen offered food, dancing and entertainment for servicemen and was staffed by members of the entertainment industry. Davis served as Canteen president through the end of the war. 
In 1983, Davis received the Distinguished Civilian Service Medal from the Department of Defense for her work with the Hollywood Canteen.

She appeared as herself in the film &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944), which used the canteen as the setting for a fictional story. Warner Bros. donated 40% of proceeds from the film to both the Hollywood Canteen and the Stage Door Canteen in Manhattan.

Davis showed little interest for the role of repressed spinster Charlotte Vale in the drama film &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942), until Hal Wallis advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. It became one of the better known of her &quot;women&#x27;s pictures&quot;. In one of the film&#x27;s most imitated scenes, Paul Henreid lights two cigarettes as he stares into Davis&#x27;s eyes, and passes one to her. Film reviewers complimented Davis on her performance, the National Board of Review commenting that she gave the film &quot;a dignity not fully warranted by the script&quot;. She received her seventh Oscar nomination for &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;.During the early 1940s, several of Davis&#x27;s film choices were influenced by the war, such as &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; (1943), by Lillian Hellman, and &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1943), a lighthearted all-star musical cavalcade. Davis performed a novelty song, &quot;They&#x27;re Either Too Young or Too Old.&quot;

&quot;Old Acquaintance&quot; (1943) reunited her with Miriam Hopkins in a story of two old friends who deal with the tensions created when one of them becomes a successful novelist. Davis felt that Hopkins tried to upstage her throughout the film. Director Vincent Sherman recalled the intense competition and animosity between the two actresses, and Davis often joked that she held back nothing in a scene in which she was required to shake Hopkins in a fit of anger.

In August 1943, Davis&#x27; husband, Arthur Farnsworth, collapsed while walking along a Hollywood street and died two days later. An autopsy revealed that his fall had been caused by a skull fracture he had suffered two weeks earlier having accidentally fallen down a flight of stairs. A finding of accidental death was reached. Highly distraught, Davis attempted to withdraw from her next film &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; (1944), but Jack Warner, who had halted production following Farnsworth&#x27;s death, persuaded her to continue. Although she had gained a reputation for being forthright and demanding, her behavior during filming of &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; was said to be erratic and out of character. She alienated Vincent Sherman by refusing to film certain scenes and insisting that some sets be rebuilt. She improvised dialogue, which made the writer Julius Epstein rewrite scenes at her whim. Davis later explained her actions with the observation &quot;When I was most unhappy, I lashed out rather than whined.&quot; Some reviewers criticized Davis for the excess of her performance; James Agee wrote that she &quot;demonstrates the horrors of egocentricity on a marathonic scale&quot;. Despite these reviews, &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; was another box-office hit and earned Davis another Academy Award nomination.

===1945–1949: Career setbacks===
In 1945, Davis married artist William Grant Sherry, her third husband, who also worked as a masseur. She had been drawn to him because he claimed he had never heard of her and so was not intimidated by her.

The same year, Davis made &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; (1945), based on the play by Emlyn Williams. Davis played Miss Moffat, an English teacher who saves a young Welsh miner (John Dall) from a life in the coal pits by offering him education. The part had been played in the theater by Ethel Barrymore (who was 61 at the play&#x27;s premiere), but Warner Bros. felt that the film version should depict the character as a younger woman. Davis disagreed, and insisted on playing the part as written, and wore a gray wig and padding under her clothes, to create a dowdy appearance. The critic E. Arnot Robertson observed: She concluded that &quot;the subtle interpretation she insisted on giving&quot; kept the focus on the teacher&#x27;s &quot;sheer joy in imparting knowledge&quot;. The film was well received by critics, and made a profit of $2.2 million.

Her next film, &quot;A Stolen Life&quot; (1946), was the only film that Davis made with her own production company, BD Productions. Davis played dual roles as twins. The film received poor reviews, and was described by Bosley Crowther as &quot;a distressingly empty piece&quot;; but, with a profit of $2.5 million, it was one of her biggest box office successes. Her next film was &quot;Deception&quot; (1946), the first of her films to lose money.
In 1947, at the age of 39, Davis gave birth to daughter Barbara Davis Sherry (known as B.D.), and later wrote in her memoir that she became absorbed in motherhood and considered ending her career. As she continued making films, however, her relationship with her daughter B.D. began to deteriorate, and her popularity with audiences steadily declined.
In 1948, Davis was cast in the melodrama &quot;Winter Meeting&quot;. Although she initially was enthusiastic, she soon learned that Warner had arranged for &quot;softer&quot; lighting to be used to disguise her age. She recalled that she had seen the same lighting technique &quot;on the sets of Ruth Chatterton and Kay Francis, and I knew what they meant&quot;. To add to her disappointment, she was not confident in the abilities of her leading man – James Davis in his first major screen role. She disagreed with changes made to the script because of censorship restrictions, and found that many of the aspects of the role that initially appealed to her had been cut. The film was described by Bosley Crowther as &quot;interminable&quot;, and he noted that &quot;of all the miserable dilemmas in which Miss Davis has been involved...this one is probably the worst&quot;. It failed at the box office, and the studio lost nearly $1 million.

While making &quot;June Bride&quot; (1948), Davis clashed with co-star Robert Montgomery, later describing him as &quot;a male Miriam Hopkins... an excellent actor, but addicted to scene-stealing&quot;. The film marked her first comedy in several years, and earned her some positive reviews, but it was not particularly popular with audiences, and returned only a small profit.

Despite the lackluster box-office receipts from her more recent films, in 1949, she negotiated a four-film contract with Warner Bros. that paid $10,285 per week and made her the highest-paid woman in the United States. However, Jack Warner had refused to allow her script approval, and cast her in &quot;Beyond the Forest&quot; (1949). Davis reportedly loathed the script and begged Warner to recast the role, but he refused. After the film was completed, her request to be released from her contract was honored.

The reviews of the film were scathing. Dorothy Manners, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, described the film as &quot;an unfortunate finale to her brilliant career&quot;. Hedda Hopper wrote: &quot;If Bette had deliberately set out to wreck her career, she could not have picked a more appropriate vehicle.&quot; The film contained the line &quot;What a dump!&quot;, which became closely associated with Davis after it was referenced in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, and impersonators began to use it in their acts. Arthur Blake was a famous female impersonator of the post World-War II era who was particularly known for his performances as Bette Davis; notably impersonating her in the 1952 film &quot;Diplomatic Courier&quot;.

===1949–1960: Starting a freelance career===
Davis filmed &quot;The Story of a Divorce&quot; (released by RKO Radio Pictures in 1951 as &quot;Payment on Demand&quot;). She played a Broadway star in &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), which earned her another Oscar nomination and won her the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. Davis read the script, described it as the best she had ever read, and accepted the role. Within days, she joined the cast in San Francisco to begin filming. During production, she established what became a lifelong friendship with her co-star Anne Baxter and a romantic relationship with her leading man Gary Merrill, which led to marriage. The film&#x27;s director Joseph L. Mankiewicz later remarked: &quot;Bette was letter perfect. She was syllable-perfect. The director&#x27;s dream: the prepared actress.&quot;

Critics responded positively to Davis&#x27;s performance, and several of her lines became well-known, particularly &quot;Fasten your seat belts, it&#x27;s going to be a bumpy night&quot;. She was again nominated for an Academy Award, and critics such as Gene Ringgold described her Margo as her &quot;all-time best performance&quot;. Pauline Kael wrote that much of Mankiewicz&#x27;s vision of &quot;the theater&quot; was &quot;nonsense&quot;, but commended Davis, writing &quot;[the film is] saved by one performance that is the real thing: Bette Davis is at her most instinctive and assured. Her actress – vain, scared, a woman who goes too far in her reactions and emotions – makes the whole thing come alive.&quot; Davis won a Best Actress award from the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award. She also received the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award as Best Actress, having been named by them as the Worst Actress of 1949 for &quot;Beyond the Forest&quot;. During this time, she was invited to leave her hand prints in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.

On July 3, 1950, Davis&#x27;s divorce from William Sherry was finalized, and on July 28, she married Gary Merrill, her fourth and final husband. With Sherry&#x27;s consent, Merrill adopted B.D., Davis&#x27;s daughter with Sherry. In January 1951, Davis and Merrill adopted a five-day-old baby girl they named Margot Mosher Merrill (born January 6, 1951 - died May 5, 2022), after the character Margo Channing. In 1952, they adopted a baby boy, Michael (born February 5, 1952). Davis and Merrill lived with their three children on an estate on the coast of Cape Elizabeth, Maine. (Davis and Merrill also stayed at Homewood Inn in Yarmouth, Maine, for six months.) After semi-retirement in the mid-1950s, Davis again starred in several movies during her time in Maine, including &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (1955), in which she played Queen Elizabeth I.

The family traveled to England, where Davis and Merrill starred in the murder-mystery film &quot;Another Man&#x27;s Poison&quot; (1951). When it received lukewarm reviews and failed at the box office, Hollywood columnists wrote that Davis&#x27;s comeback had petered out, and an Academy Award nomination for &quot;The Star&quot; (1952) did not halt her decline at the box office.

In 1952, Davis appeared in the Broadway revue &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot;, directed by Jules Dassin. She was uncomfortable working outside of her area of expertise; she never had been a musical performer, and her limited theater experience had been more than 20 years earlier. She was also severely ill, and was operated on for osteomyelitis of the jaw. Margot was diagnosed as severely brain-damaged due to an injury sustained during or shortly after her birth. Though Davis tried to care for Margot, she eventually placed her daughter in an institution around the age of 3. Davis and Merrill began arguing frequently, and B.D. later recalled episodes of alcohol abuse and domestic violence.

Few of Davis&#x27;s films of the 1950s were successful, and many of her performances were condemned by critics. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote of mannerisms &quot;that you&#x27;d expect to find in a nightclub impersonation of [Davis]&quot;, while the London critic Richard Winninger wrote
Her films of this period included &quot;Storm Center&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Catered Affair&quot; (1956). As her career declined, her marriage continued to deteriorate until she filed for divorce in 1960. The following year, her mother died. During the same time, she tried television, appearing in three episodes of the popular NBC Western &quot;Wagon Train&quot; as three different characters in 1959 and 1961; her first appearance on TV had been February 25, 1956, on &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot;.

In 1960, Davis, a registered Democrat, appeared at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, where she met future President John F. Kennedy, whom she greatly admired. Outside of acting and politics, Davis was an active and practicing Episcopalian.

===1961–1970: Renewed success===
In 1961, Davis opened in the Broadway production &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; to mostly mediocre reviews, and left the production after four months due to &quot;chronic illness&quot;. She then joined Glenn Ford and Hope Lange for the Frank Capra film &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; (1961), a remake of Capra&#x27;s 1933 film, &quot;Lady for a Day&quot;, based on a story by Damon Runyon. Exhibitors protested her star billing as they considered it would negatively impact the box office performance and, despite the appearance of Ford, the film failed at the box office.

Her last Oscar nomination was for the Grand Guignol horror film &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962), which also starred Joan Crawford. Crawford showed interest in the script and considered Davis for the part of Jane. Davis believed it could appeal to the same audience that had recently made Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) a success. She negotiated a deal that would pay her 10 percent of the worldwide gross profits in addition to her salary. The film became one of the year&#x27;s big successes.

Davis and Crawford played two aging sisters, one a former child star (Davis) and the other an accomplished film actress (Crawford) who were forced by circumstance to share a decaying Hollywood mansion. The director, Robert Aldrich, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers.
Regardless of their personal feelings toward one another, Davis and Crawford spoke highly of each other&#x27;s acting talent. Crawford said Davis was a &quot;fascinating actress&quot; but they never became friends as they only worked on that one film together and had few opportunities outside that association. Davis also said Crawford was a good, professional actress. Despite the alleged &quot;feud,&quot; Crawford heavily promoted Davis&#x27;s performance. Crawford told reporter Wayne Allen, &quot;I&#x27;ll predict here and now that Miss Davis will win an Oscar for it.&quot; 
Their alleged feud was eventually turned into the 2017 limited series &quot;Feud&quot; by Ryan Murphy.

Davis also received her only BAFTA nomination for this performance. Daughter Barbara (credited as B.D. Merrill) played a small role in the film, and when she and Davis visited the Cannes Film Festival to promote it, Barbara met Jeremy Hyman, an executive for Seven Arts Productions. After a short courtship, she married Hyman at the age of 16, with Davis&#x27;s permission.
In October 1962, it was announced that four episodes of the CBS-TV series &quot;Perry Mason&quot; would feature special guest stars who would cover for Raymond Burr during his convalescence from surgery. A &quot;Perry Mason&quot; fan, Davis was the first of the guest stars. &quot;The Case of Constant Doyle&quot; began filming on December 12, 1962, and aired January 31, 1963.

In 1962, Davis appeared as Celia Miller on the TV western &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode titled &quot;The Accomplice.&quot;

In September 1962, Davis placed an advertisement in &quot;Variety&quot; under the heading of &quot;Situations wanted – women artists&quot;, which read: &quot;Mother of three – 10, 11, &amp; 15 – divorcee. American. Thirty years experience as an actress in Motion Pictures. Mobile still, and more affable than rumor would have it. Wants steady employment in Hollywood. (Has had Broadway.)&quot; Davis said that she intended it as a joke, and she sustained her comeback over the course of several years.

&quot;Dead Ringer&quot; (1964) was a crime drama in which she played twin sisters. The film was an American adaptation of the Mexican film &quot;La Otra&quot;, starring Dolores del Río. &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; (1964) was a romantic drama based on a Harold Robbins novel. Davis played the mother of Susan Hayward, but filming was hampered by heated arguments between Davis and Hayward.

&quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964) was Robert Aldrich&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;. Aldrich planned to reunite Davis and Crawford, but the latter withdrew allegedly due to illness soon after filming began. She was replaced by Olivia de Havilland. The film was a considerable success, and brought renewed attention to its veteran cast, which included Joseph Cotten, Mary Astor, Agnes Moorehead, and Cecil Kellaway.

The following year, Davis was cast as the lead in an Aaron Spelling sitcom, &quot;The Decorator&quot;. A pilot episode was filmed, but was not shown, and the project was terminated. By the end of the decade, Davis had appeared in the British films &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1965), &quot;The Anniversary&quot; (1968), and &quot;Connecting Rooms&quot; (1970), none of which were reviewed well, and her career again stalled.

===1971–1983: Later career===
In the early 1970s, Davis was invited to appear in New York City in a stage presentation titled &quot;Great Ladies of the American Cinema&quot;. Over five successive nights, a different female star discussed her career, and answered questions from the audience; Myrna Loy, Rosalind Russell, Lana Turner, Sylvia Sidney, and Joan Crawford were the other participants. Davis was well-received, and was invited to tour Australia with the similarly themed &quot;Bette Davis in Person and on Film&quot;; its success allowed her to take the production to the United Kingdom.

In 1972, Davis played the lead role in two television films that were each intended as pilots for upcoming series for ABC and NBC, &quot;Madame Sin&quot;, with Robert Wagner, and &quot;The Judge and Jake Wyler&quot;, with Doug McClure and Joan Van Ark, but in each case, the network decided against producing a series.

She appeared in the stage production &quot;Miss Moffat&quot;, a musical adaptation of her film &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;, but after the show was panned by the Philadelphia critics during its pre-Broadway run, she cited a back injury, and abandoned the show, which closed immediately.

She played supporting roles in Luigi Comencini&#x27;s &quot;Lo Scopone scientifico&quot; (1972) with Joseph Cotten and Italian actors Alberto Sordi and Silvana Mangano; &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; (1976), a Dan Curtis film, for which she won the award for Best Supporting Actress at the Saturn Awards; and &quot;The Disappearance of Aimee&quot; (1976); but she clashed with Karen Black and Faye Dunaway, the stars of the two latter productions, because she felt that neither extended her an appropriate degree of respect and that their behavior on the film sets was unprofessional.
In 1977, Davis became the first woman to receive the American Film Institute&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. The televised event included comments from several of Davis&#x27;s colleagues, including William Wyler, who joked that given the chance, Davis would still like to re-film a scene from &quot;The Letter&quot; to which Davis nodded. Jane Fonda, Henry Fonda, Natalie Wood, and Olivia de Havilland were among the performers who paid tribute, with de Havilland commenting that Davis &quot;got the roles I always wanted&quot;.

Following the telecast, she found herself in demand again, often having to choose between several offers. She accepted roles in the television miniseries &quot;The Dark Secret of Harvest Home&quot; (1978) and the theatrical film &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978), an Agatha Christie murder mystery. The bulk of her remaining work was for television. She won an Emmy Award for &quot;&quot; (1979) with Gena Rowlands, and was nominated for her performances in &quot;White Mama&quot; (1980) and &quot;Little Gloria... Happy at Last&quot; (1982). She also played supporting roles in the Disney films &quot;Return from Witch Mountain&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Watcher in the Woods&quot; (1980).

Davis&#x27;s name became well known to a younger audience when Kim Carnes&#x27;s song &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; (written by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon) became a worldwide hit and the best-selling record of 1981 in the U.S., where it stayed at number one on the music charts for more than two months. Davis&#x27;s grandson was impressed that she was the subject of a hit song and Davis considered it a compliment, writing to both Carnes and the songwriters, and accepting the gift of gold and platinum records from Carnes, and hanging them on her wall.

She continued acting for television, appearing in &quot;Family Reunion&quot; (1981) with her grandson J. Ashley Hyman, &quot;A Piano for Mrs. Cimino&quot; (1982), for which she won the Best Actress Award at The Monte Carlo Television Festival, and &quot;Right of Way&quot; (1983) with James Stewart. In 1983, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.

===1983–1989: Illness, awards, and final works===
Her career went through several periods of eclipse, but despite a long period of ill health she continued acting in film and on television until shortly before her death from breast cancer in 1989. She admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships. She was married four times, divorcing three and widowed once. She raised her children largely as a single parent.
In 1983, after filming the pilot episode for the television series &quot;Hotel&quot;, Davis was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. Within two weeks of her surgery, she had four strokes which caused paralysis in the left side of her face and in her left arm, and left her with slurred speech. She commenced a lengthy period of physical therapy, and aided by her personal assistant Kathryn Sermak gained partial recovery from the paralysis. Even late in life, Davis smoked 100 cigarettes per day.

During this time, her relationship with her daughter B.D. Hyman deteriorated when Hyman became a born-again Christian and attempted to persuade Davis to follow suit. With her health stable, she traveled to England to film the Agatha Christie mystery &quot;Murder with Mirrors&quot; (1985). Upon her return, she learned that Hyman had published &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, in which she chronicled a difficult mother-daughter relationship and depicted scenes of Davis&#x27;s overbearing and drunken behavior. The book was not well-received--Davis disinherited Hyman, and Hyman&#x27;s brother disowned her.

Several of Davis&#x27;s friends commented that Hyman&#x27;s depiction of events was not accurate; one said &quot;So much of the book is out of context&quot;. Mike Wallace re-broadcast a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview he had filmed with Hyman a few years earlier in which she commended Davis on her skills as a mother, and said that she had adopted many of Davis&#x27;s principles in raising her own children.

Critics of Hyman noted that Davis financially supported the Hyman family for several years and had recently saved them from losing their house. Despite the acrimony of their divorce years earlier, Gary Merrill also defended Davis. Interviewed by CNN, Merrill said that Hyman was motivated by &quot;cruelty and greed&quot;. Davis&#x27;s adopted son Michael Merrill ended contact with Hyman, and refused to speak to her again, as did Davis, who disinherited her.
In her second memoir &quot;This &#x27;n That&quot; (1987), Davis wrote: &quot;I am still recovering from the fact that a child of mine would write about me behind my back, to say nothing about the kind of book it is. I will never recover as completely from B.D.&#x27;s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences.&quot; Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as Hyman, and described her actions as &quot;a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given&quot;. She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman&#x27;s book, &quot;If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I&#x27;ve been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made your book about me a success.&quot;

Davis appeared in the television film &quot;As Summers Die&quot; (1986), and in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;The Whales of August&quot; (1987), in which she played the blind sister of Lillian Gish. Though in poor health at the time, Davis memorized her own and everyone else&#x27;s lines as she always had. The film earned good reviews, with one critic writing: &quot;Bette crawls across the screen like a testy old hornet on a windowpane, snarling, staggering, twitching – a symphony of misfired synapses.&quot; Davis became an honoree of the Kennedy Center Honors for her contribution to films in 1987.

Her last performance was the title role in Larry Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Wicked Stepmother&quot; (1989). By this time, her health was failing, and after disagreements with Cohen, she walked off the set. The script was rewritten to place more emphasis on Barbara Carrera&#x27;s character, and the reworked version was released after Davis&#x27;s death.

After abandoning &quot;Wicked Stepmother&quot;, and with no further film offers (though she was keen to play the centenarian in Craig Calman&#x27;s &quot;The Turn of the Century&quot;, and worked with him on adapting the stage play to a feature-length screenplay), Davis appeared on several talk shows, and was interviewed by Johnny Carson, Joan Rivers, Larry King, and David Letterman, discussing her career, but refusing to discuss her daughter. Her appearances were popular; Lindsay Anderson observed that the public enjoyed seeing her behaving &quot;so bitchy&quot;: &quot;I always disliked that because she was encouraged to behave badly. And I&#x27;d always hear her described by that awful word, feisty.&quot;

During 1988 and 1989, Davis was honored for her career achievements, receiving the Legion of Honor from France, the Campione d&#x27;Italia from Italy, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center Lifetime Achievement Award. She appeared on British television in a special broadcast from the South Bank Centre, discussing film and her career.

== Death ==

Davis collapsed during the American Cinema Awards in 1989, and later discovered that her cancer had returned. She recovered sufficiently to travel to Spain, where she was honored at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, but during her visit, her health rapidly deteriorated. Too weak to make the long journey back to the U.S., she traveled to France, where she died of metastasized breast cancer on October 6, 1989, at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Davis was 81 years old. A memorial tribute was held by invitation only at Burbank Studio&#x27;s stage 18 where a work light was turned on signaling the end of production.

She was entombed in Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, alongside her mother Ruthie and sister Bobby, with her name in larger letters. On her tombstone is written: &quot;She did it the hard way&quot;, an epitaph that she mentioned in her memoir &quot;Mother Goddam&quot; as having been suggested to her by Joseph L. Mankiewicz shortly after they had filmed &quot;All About Eve&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
===Roles and performances===
As early as 1936, Graham Greene summarized Davis: 

In 1964, Jack Warner spoke of the &quot;magic quality that transformed this sometimes bland and not beautiful little girl into a great artist&quot;, and in a 1988 interview, Davis remarked that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she had forged a career without the benefit of beauty. She admitted she was terrified during the making of her early films, and that she became tough by necessity. &quot;Until you&#x27;re known in my profession as a monster, you are not a star&quot;, she said, &quot;[but] I&#x27;ve never fought for anything in a treacherous way. I&#x27;ve never fought for anything but the good of the film.&quot; During the making of &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), Joseph L. Mankiewicz told her of the perception in Hollywood that she was difficult, and she explained that when the audience saw her on screen, they did not consider that her appearance was the result of numerous people working behind the scenes. If she was presented as &quot;a horse&#x27;s ass ... forty feet wide, and thirty feet high&quot;, that is all the audience &quot;would see or care about&quot;.

While lauded for her achievements, Davis and her films were sometimes derided; Pauline Kael described &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942) as a &quot;shlock classic&quot;, and by the mid-1940s, her sometimes mannered and histrionic performances had become the subject of caricature. Edwin Schallert, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, praised Davis&#x27;s performance in &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; (1944), while observing, &quot;The mimics will have more fun than a box of monkeys imitating Miss Davis&quot;; and Dorothy Manners, at the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, said of her performance in the poorly received &quot;Beyond the Forest&quot; (1949): &quot;No night club caricaturist has ever turned in such a cruel imitation of the Davis mannerisms as Bette turns on herself in this one.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted that Davis was compulsively watchable, even while criticizing her acting technique, summarizing her performance in &quot;Dead Ringer&quot; (1964) with the observation, &quot;Her acting, as always, isn&#x27;t really acting: It&#x27;s shameless showing off. But just try to look away!&quot;

Her film choices were often unconventional: Davis sought roles as manipulators and killers in an era when actresses usually preferred to play sympathetic characters, and she excelled in them. She favored authenticity over glamour, and was willing to change her own appearance if it suited the character.
As she entered old age, Davis was acknowledged for her achievements. John Springer, who had arranged her speaking tours of the early 1970s, wrote that despite the accomplishments of many of her contemporaries, Davis was &quot;the star of the thirties and into the forties&quot;, achieving notability for the variety of her characterizations and her ability to assert herself, even when her material was mediocre. Individual performances continued to receive praise; in 1987, Bill Collins analyzed &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940), and described her performance as &quot;a brilliant, subtle achievement&quot;, and wrote: &quot;Bette Davis makes Leslie Crosbie one of the most extraordinary females in movies.&quot; In a 2000 review for &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), Roger Ebert noted: &quot;Davis was a character, an icon with a grand style; so, even her excesses are realistic.&quot; In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine ranked her portrayal of Margo Channing in the film as fifth on their list of 100 Greatest Performances of All Time, commenting: &quot;There is something deliciously audacious about her gleeful willingness to play such unattractive emotions as jealousy, bitterness, and neediness.&quot; While reviewing &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962) in 2008, Ebert asserted that, &quot;No one who has seen the film will ever forget her.&quot;

In 1977, Davis became the first woman to be honored with the AFI Life Achievement Award. In 1999, the American Film Institute published its list of the &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Stars&quot;, which was the result of a film-industry poll to determine the &quot;50 Greatest American Screen Legends&quot; in order to raise public awareness and appreciation of classic film. Of the 25 actresses listed, Davis was ranked at number two, behind Katharine Hepburn.

===Memorials===
A few months before her death in 1989, Davis was one of several actors featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. In a film retrospective that celebrated the films and stars of 1939, &quot;Life&quot; concluded that Davis was the most significant actress of her era, and highlighted &quot;Dark Victory&quot; (1939) as one of the more important films of the year. Her death made front-page news throughout the world as the &quot;close of yet another chapter of the Golden Age of Hollywood&quot;. Angela Lansbury summarized the feeling of those of the Hollywood community who attended her memorial service, commenting, after a sample from Davis&#x27;s films was screened, that they had witnessed &quot;an extraordinary legacy of acting in the twentieth century by a real master of the craft&quot; that should provide &quot;encouragement and illustration to future generations of aspiring actors&quot;.

The United States Postal Service honored Davis with a commemorative postage stamp in 2008, marking the 100th anniversary of her birth. The stamp features an image of her in the role of Margo Channing in &quot;All About Eve&quot;. The First Day of Issue celebration took place September 18, 2008, at Boston University, which houses an extensive Davis archive. Featured speakers included her son Michael Merrill and Lauren Bacall. In 1997, the executors of her estate, Merrill and Kathryn Sermak, her former assistant, established The Bette Davis Foundation, which awards college scholarships to promising actors and actresses.

In 2017, Sermak published the memoir &quot;Miss D &amp; Me: Life With the Invincible Bette Davis&quot;, a book Davis had requested Sermak to write, detailing their years spent together.

===In popular culture===
In 1981, the song &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;, performed by Kim Carnes, won two Grammy Awards (Song of the Year and Record of the Year) and spent a total of nine weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Davis wrote letters to Carnes and the writers of the song, Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon, to thank them for making her &quot;a part of modern times&quot;, and said that her grandson now looked up to her. After their Grammy wins, Davis sent them roses.

Other references to Davis are made in Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Desolation Row&quot;, in the song &quot;Celluloid Heroes&quot; by the Kinks, in the 1990 Madonna song &quot;Vogue&quot;, in “Silver Screen Romance” by American rock band Good Charlotte, and in &quot;Girl on TV&quot; by the boy band LFO. There is also the line &quot;I don&#x27;t know how you came to get the Bette Davis knees, but worst of all young man, you&#x27;ve got industrial disease&quot; in the hit song &#x27;Industrial Disease&#x27; by the band Dire Straits (1982).

Davis attracted a following in the gay subculture, and was frequently imitated by female impersonators such as Arthur Blake and Charles Pierce. Attempting to explain her popularity with gay audiences, the journalist Jim Emerson wrote: &quot;Was she just a camp figurehead because her brittle, melodramatic style of acting hadn&#x27;t aged well? Or was it that she was &#x27;Larger Than Life&#x27;, a tough broad who had survived? Probably some of both.&quot;

In &quot;House of Wax&quot; (2005), in her attempt to blend in with the other wax figures in the local movie house, the lead female character has to sit through a scene from &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane .&quot;

The alleged feud between Davis and Joan Crawford is the subject of the 1989 book &quot;Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud&quot;. It was later depicted in the 2017 television series &quot;Feud: Bette and Joan&quot;, with Susan Sarandon as Davis and Jessica Lange as Crawford.

== Academy Awards ==

Davis established several Oscar milestones. Among them, she became the first person to earn five consecutive Academy Award nominations for acting, all in the Best Actress category (1938–1942). Her record has only been matched by one other performer, Greer Garson, who also earned five consecutive nominations in the Best Actress category (1941–1945), including three years when both these actresses were nominated.

In 1962, Bette Davis became the first person to secure 10 Academy Award nominations for acting—though one could argue her 10th nomination was in 1952, and her 11th in 1962, as her write-in nomination for &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; remains a source of contention (she came in 3rd in the voting, ahead of official nominee Grace Moore). Since then only three people have surpassed this figure—Meryl Streep (with 21 nominations and three wins), Katharine Hepburn (12 nominations and 4 wins), and Jack Nicholson (12 nominations and 3 wins)—while Laurence Olivier matched her (10 nominations and 1 win).

Steven Spielberg purchased Davis&#x27;s Oscars for &quot;Dangerous&quot; (1935) and &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938), when they were offered for auction for $207,500 and $578,000, respectively, and returned them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

She rose to prominence acting in the comedies &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; (1965), &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1967), &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (1977), &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978), &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; (1979), and &quot;9 to 5&quot; (1980). Fonda established herself as a dramatic actress, winning two Academy Awards for Best Actress for her roles as a prostitute in the thriller &quot;Klute&quot; (1971) and the woman in love with a Vietnam War veteran in the drama &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1978). She was Oscar-nominated for &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), &quot;Julia&quot; (1977), &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; (1979), &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Morning After&quot; (1986). After a 15 year hiatus, she returned to acting in &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot; (2005), &quot;Youth&quot; (2015), and &quot;Our Souls at Night&quot; (2017). 

On stage, Fonda made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;There Was a Little Girl&quot; (1960), for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. In 2009, she returned to Broadway for the play &quot;33 Variations&quot; (2009), earning a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play nomination. For her work on television, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for the television film &quot;The Dollmaker&quot; (1984). She also was Emmy-nominated for her roles in &quot;The Newsroom&quot; (2012–2014) and &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; (2015–2022). 

Fonda was a political activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War. She was photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi, during which she gained the nickname &quot;Hanoi Jane&quot;. Fonda protested the Iraq War along with violence against women, and she describes herself as a feminist and environmental activist. Fonda has co-founded the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Political Committee in 1984 and the Women&#x27;s Media Center in 2005. Fonda is also known for her exercise tapes, starting with &quot;Jane Fonda&#x27;s Workout&quot; (1982), which became the highest-selling videotape of its time.

==Early life and education==
Jane Seymour Fonda was born via caesarean section on December 21, 1937, at Doctors Hospital in Yorkville, Manhattan in New York City. Her parents were Canadian-born socialite Frances Ford Seymour and American actor Henry Fonda. According to her father, the surname Fonda came from an Italian ancestor who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s. There, he intermarried; the resultant family began to use Dutch given names, with Jane&#x27;s first Fonda ancestor reaching New York in 1650. Fonda also has English, French, and Scottish ancestry. She was named for the third wife of Henry VIII, Jane Seymour, to whom she is distantly related on her mother&#x27;s side, and because of whom, until she was in fourth grade, Fonda said she was called &quot;Lady&quot; (as in Lady Jane). Her brother, Peter Fonda, was also an actor, and her maternal half-sister is Frances de Villers Brokaw (also known as &quot;Pan&quot;), whose daughter is Pilar Corrias, the owner of the Pilar Corrias Gallery in London.

In 1950, when Fonda was 12, her mother died by suicide while undergoing treatment at Craig House psychiatric hospital in Beacon, New York. Later that year, Henry Fonda married socialite Susan Blanchard, 23 years his junior; this marriage ended in divorce. Aged 15, Jane taught dance at Fire Island Pines, New York. Fonda attended Greenwich Academy in Greenwich, Connecticut; the Emma Willard School in Troy, New York; and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Before her acting career, she was a model and appeared twice on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;.

Fonda became interested in the arts in 1954, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of &quot;The Country Girl&quot; at the Omaha Community Playhouse. After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for six months to study art. Upon returning to the US, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg; the meeting changed the course of her life. Fonda said, &quot;I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father – who had to say so – told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!&quot;

==Career==
===1959–1969: Early roles and breakthrough ===
Fonda&#x27;s stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with &quot;Tall Story&quot;, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. &quot;Period of Adjustment&quot; and &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; followed in 1962. In &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, Fonda played a prostitute and earned a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer. In 1963, she starred in &quot;Sunday in New York&quot;. &quot;Newsday&quot; called her &quot;the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses&quot;. However, she also had detractors – in the same year, the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; named her the &quot;Year&#x27;s Worst Actress&quot; for &quot;The Chapman Report&quot;. Her next two pictures, &quot;Joy House&quot; and &quot;Circle of Love&quot; (both 1964), were made in France; with the latter, Fonda became one of the first American film stars to appear nude in a foreign movie. She was offered the coveted role of Lara in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, but turned it down because she didn&#x27;t want to go on location for nine months.

Fonda&#x27;s career breakthrough came with &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm-turned-outlaw. This comedy Western received five Oscar nominations, with Lee Marvin winning best actor, and was one of the year&#x27;s top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to bankable stardom. The following year, she had a starring role in &quot;The Chase&quot; opposite Robert Redford, in their first film together, with two-time Oscar winner Marlon Brando. The film received some positive reviews, but Fonda&#x27;s performance was noticed by &quot;Variety&quot; magazine: &quot;Jane Fonda, as Redford&#x27;s wife and the mistress of wealthy oilman James Fox, makes the most of the biggest female role.&quot; She returned to France to make &quot;The Game Is Over&quot; (1966), often described as her sexiest film, and appeared in the August 1966 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, in paparazzi shots taken on the set. Fonda immediately sued the magazine for publishing them without her consent. After this came the comedies &quot;Any Wednesday&quot; (1966), opposite Jason Robards and Dean Jones, and &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1967), again co-starring Redford.

In 1968, she played the title role in the science fiction spoof &quot;Barbarella&quot;, which established her status as a sex symbol. In contrast, the tragedy &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969) won her critical acclaim and marked a significant turning point in her career; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Fonda, as the unremittingly cynical loser, the tough and bruised babe of the Dust Bowl, gives a dramatic performance that gives the film a personal focus and an emotionally gripping power.&quot; In addition, renowned film critic Pauline Kael, in her &quot;New Yorker&quot; review of the film, noted of Fonda: &quot;[She] has been a charming, witty nudie cutie in recent years and now gets a chance at an archetypal character. Fonda goes all the way with it, as screen actresses rarely do once they become stars. She doesn&#x27;t try to save some ladylike part of herself, the way even a good actress like Audrey Hepburn does, peeping at us from behind &#x27;vulgar&#x27; roles to assure us she&#x27;s not really like that. Fonda stands a good chance of personifying American tensions and dominating our movies in the seventies as Bette Davis did in the thirties.&quot; For her performance, she won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and earned her first Academy Awards nomination for Best Actress. Fonda was very selective by the end of the decade, turning down lead roles in &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; and &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.

===1970–1979: Widespread success and acclaim===
In the seventies, Fonda enjoyed her most critically acclaimed period as an actress despite some setbacks for her ongoing activism. According to writer and critic Hilton Als, her performances starting with &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over. Fonda&#x27;s ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation.

Fonda won her first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1971, playing a high-priced call girl, the gamine Bree Daniels, in Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s neo-noir psychological thriller &quot;Klute&quot;. Prior to shooting, Fonda spent time interviewing several prostitutes and madams. Years later, Fonda discovered that &quot;there was like a marriage, a melding of souls between this character and me, this woman that I didn&#x27;t think I could play because I didn&#x27;t think I was call girl material. It didn&#x27;t matter.&quot; Upon its release, &quot;Klute&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, and Fonda&#x27;s performance earned her widespread recognition. Pauline Kael wrote:
As an actress, [Fonda] has a special kind of smartness that takes the form of speed; she&#x27;s always a little ahead of everybody, and this quicker beat – this quicker responsiveness – makes her more exciting to watch. This quality works to great advantage in her full-scale, definitive portrait of a call girl in &quot;Klute&quot;. It&#x27;s a good, big role for her, and she disappears into Bree, the call girl, so totally that her performance is very pure – unadorned by &quot;acting&quot;. She never stands outside Bree, she gives herself over to the role, and yet she isn&#x27;t lost in it—she&#x27;s fully in control, and her means are extraordinarily economical. She has somehow got to a plane of acting at which even the closest closeup never reveals a false thought and, seen on the movie streets a block away, she&#x27;s Bree, not Jane Fonda, walking toward us. There isn&#x27;t another young dramatic actress in American films who can touch her.
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; also praised Fonda&#x27;s performance, even suggesting that the film should have been titled &quot;Bree&quot; after her character: &quot;What is it about Jane Fonda that makes her such a fascinating actress to watch? She has a sort of nervous intensity that keeps her so firmly locked into a film character that the character actually seems distracted by things that come up in the movie.&quot; During the 1971–1972 awards season, Fonda dominated the Best Actress category at almost every major awards ceremony; in addition to her Oscar win, she received her first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, her first National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress and her second New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.

Between &quot;Klute&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; in 1977, Fonda did not have a major film success. She appeared in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973), &quot;Steelyard Blues&quot; and &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (1976). In the first, some critics felt Fonda was miscast, but her work as Nora Helmer drew praise, and a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined, &quot;Though the Losey film is ferociously flawed, I recommend it for Jane Fonda&#x27;s performance. Beforehand, it seemed fair to wonder if she could personify someone from the past; her voice, inflections, and ways of moving have always seemed totally contemporary. But once again she proves herself to be one of our finest actresses, and she&#x27;s at home in the 1870s, a creature of that period as much as of ours.&quot; From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: &quot;I can&#x27;t say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted.&quot; However, in her 2005 autobiography, &quot;My Life So Far&quot;, she rejected such simplification. &quot;The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed.&quot; She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of &#x27;issue-driven&#x27; films reflected this new focus.

In 1972, Fonda starred as a reporter alongside Yves Montand in &quot;Tout Va Bien&quot;, directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. The two directors then made &quot;Letter to Jane&quot;, in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda. At the time, while in Rome, she joined a feminist march on March 8 and gave a brief speech of support for the Italian women&#x27;s rights.

Through her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; is generally considered her &quot;comeback&quot; picture. Critical reaction was mixed, but Fonda&#x27;s comic performance was praised; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked, &quot;I never have trouble remembering that Miss Fonda is a fine dramatic actress but I&#x27;m surprised all over again every time I see her do comedy with the mixture of comic intelligence and abandon she shows here.&quot; Also in 1977, she portrayed the playwright Lillian Hellman in &quot;Julia&quot;, receiving positive reviews from critics. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described her performance as &quot;edgy, persuasive and intriguingly tensed-up,&quot; commenting further, &quot;Irritable, intent and agonizingly self-conscious, Fonda suggests the internal conflicts gnawing at a talented woman who craves the self-assurance, resolve and wisdom she sees in figures like Julia and Hammett.&quot; For her performance, Fonda won her first BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and received her third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

During this period, Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; because she felt the part was not relevant. In 1978, Fonda was at a career peak after she won her second Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Sally Hyde, a conflicted adulteress in &quot;Coming Home&quot;, the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran&#x27;s difficulty in re-entering civilian life. Upon its release, the film emerged as a major commercial success with audiences and received positive reviews from critics; Ebert noted that her Sally Hyde was &quot;the kind of character you somehow wouldn&#x27;t expect the outspoken, intelligent Fonda to play,&quot; and Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot; felt that Fonda was &quot;a marvel to watch; what fascinates and involves me in her performance are the conscientious effort and thought that seem to go into every line reading and gesture, as if the question of what a captain&#x27;s wife and former cheerleader was like became a source of endless curiosity and discovery for her.&quot; Her performance also earned her a third Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama as well, making this her second consecutive win. Also in 1978, she reunited with Alan J. Pakula to star in his post-modern Western drama &quot;Comes a Horseman&quot; as a hard-bitten rancher, and later took on a supporting role in &quot;California Suite&quot;, where she played a Manhattan workaholic and divorcee. &quot;Variety&quot; noted that she &quot;demonstrates yet another aspect of her amazing range&quot; and &quot;Time Out New York&quot; remarked that she gave &quot;another performance of unnerving sureness&quot;.

She won her second BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with &quot;The China Syndrome&quot;, about a cover-up of a vulnerability in a nuclear power plant. Cast alongside Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas, in one of his early roles, Fonda played a clever, ambitious television news reporter. Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, singled out Fonda&#x27;s performance for praise: &quot;The three stars are splendid, but maybe Miss Fonda is just a bit more than that. Her performance is not that of an actress in a star&#x27;s role, but that of an actress creating a character that happens to be major within the film. She keeps getting better and better.&quot; This role also earned her Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. The same year, she starred in the western adventure-romance film &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; with her frequent co-star, Robert Redford. Although the film received mixed reviews, &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; was a box office success, becoming the eleventh highest-grossing film of 1979 after grossing a domestic total of nearly $62 million. By the late 1970s, &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; ranked Fonda as Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable actress.

===1980–1991: Established star and hiatus===
In 1980, Fonda starred in &quot;9 to 5&quot; with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year. Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, specifically for her father and her. The father-daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real-life relationship between the two Fondas; they eventually became the first father-daughter duo to earn Oscar nominations (Jane earned her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination) for their roles in the same film. &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, which also starred four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later. Both films grossed over $100 million domestically.

Fonda continued to appear in feature films throughout the 1980s, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for her portrayal of a Kentucky mountain woman in &quot;The Dollmaker&quot; (1984), and starring in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1985). The following year, she played an alcoholic actress and murder suspect in the 1986 thriller &quot;The Morning After&quot;, opposite Jeff Bridges. In preparation for her role, Fonda modeled the character on the starlet Gail Russell, who, at 36, was found dead in her apartment, among empty liquor bottles. Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Pauline Kael commended Fonda for giving &quot;a raucous-voiced, down-in-the-dirty performance that has some of the charge of her Bree in &quot;Klute&quot;, back in 1971&quot;. For her performance, she was nominated for yet another Academy Award for Best Actress. She ended the decade by appearing in &quot;Old Gringo&quot;.

For many years Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after fracturing her foot while filming &quot;The China Syndrome&quot;, she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The &quot;Leni Workout&quot; became the &quot;Jane Fonda Workout&quot;, which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled &quot;Jane Fonda&#x27;s Workout&quot;, inspired by her best-selling book, &quot;Jane Fonda&#x27;s Workout Book&quot;. &quot;Jane Fonda&#x27;s Workout&quot; became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video&#x27;s release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were directed by Sidney Galanty, who produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series. She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.

On May 3, 1983, she entered into a non-exclusive agreement with movie production distributor Columbia Pictures, whereas she would star in and/or produce projects under her own banner Jayne Development Corporation, and she would develop offices at The Burbank Studios, and the company immediately started after her previous office she co-founded with Bruce Gilbert, IPC Films shuttered down. On June 25, 1985, she renamed her production company, Fonda Films, because the original name felt that it would sound like a real estate company. In 1990, she starred in the romantic drama &quot;Stanley &amp; Iris&quot; (1990) with Robert De Niro, which was her last film for 15 years. The film did not fare well at the box office. Despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, Fonda&#x27;s performance as the widowed Iris was praised by Vincent Canby, who stated, &quot;Fonda&#x27;s increasingly rich resources as an actress are evident in abundance here. They even overcome one&#x27;s awareness that just beneath Iris&#x27;s frumpy clothes, there is a firm, perfectly molded body that has become a multi-million-dollar industry.&quot;
In 1991, after three decades in film, Fonda announced her retirement from the film industry.

===2005–2014: Return to acting and Broadway ===
In 2005, she returned to the screen with the box office success &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot;, starring opposite Jennifer Lopez. Two years later, Fonda starred in the Garry Marshall-directed drama &quot;Georgia Rule&quot; alongside Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan. &quot;Georgia Rule&quot; was panned by critics, but A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt the film belonged to Fonda and co-star Lohan, before writing, &quot;Ms. Fonda&#x27;s straight back and piercing eyes, the righteous jaw line she inherited from her father and a reputation for humorlessness all serve her well here, but it is her warmth and comic timing that make Georgia more than a provincial scold.&quot; In 2009, Fonda returned to Broadway for the first time since 1963, playing Katherine Brandt in Moisés Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;33 Variations&quot;. In a mixed review, Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Fonda&#x27;s &quot;layered crispness&quot; and her &quot;aura of beleaguered briskness that flirts poignantly with the ghost of her spiky, confrontational screen presence as a young woman. For those who grew up enthralled with Ms. Fonda&#x27;s screen image, it&#x27;s hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.&quot; The role earned her a Tony nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.

Fonda played a leading role in the 2011 drama &quot;All Together&quot;, which was her first film in French since &quot;Tout Va Bien&quot; in 1972. The same year she starred alongside Catherine Keener in &quot;Peace, Love and Misunderstanding&quot;, playing a hippie grandmother. In 2012, Fonda began a recurring role as Leona Lansing, CEO of a major media company, in HBO&#x27;s original political drama &quot;The Newsroom&quot;. Her role continued throughout the show&#x27;s three seasons, and Fonda received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.

In 2013, Fonda had a small role in the Lee Daniels directed racial drama &quot;The Butler&quot; inspired by the life and career of White House butler Eugene Allen. Fonda portrayed First Lady Nancy Reagan opposite Alan Rickman as United States President Ronald Reagan. Fonda stated that despite her political differences with Nancy she had no difficulty playing the role saying, &quot;I am an actor, and I have no intention of allowing the political differences between us to color my portrayal of her. I will not be disrespectful.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote in his review, &quot;the best cameo...comes from Jane Fonda, who is very good indeed as a gracious Nancy Reagan.&quot; Katey Rich of &quot;The Guardian&quot; agreed writing, &quot;Fonda eerily transforms herself into Nancy Reagan&quot;. She had more film work the following year, appearing in the comedies &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; and &quot;This is Where I Leave You&quot;. She voiced Maxine Lombard in the season 26 episode &quot;Opposites A-Frack&quot;. a character on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She played an acting diva in Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s &quot;Youth&quot; in 2015, for which she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination. She also appeared in &quot;Fathers and Daughters&quot; (2015) with Russell Crowe.

=== 2015–present: &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; and other roles ===
Fonda appeared as the co-lead in the Netflix series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;. She and Lily Tomlin played aging women whose husbands reveal they are in love with one another. Filming on the first season was completed in November 2014, and the show premiered online on May 8, 2015. The series concluded in 2022 after running for 7 seasons.

In 2016, Fonda voiced Shuriki in &quot;Elena and the Secret of Avalor&quot;. In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Fonda and others told the stories of the people killed there.

Fonda starred in her fourth collaboration with Robert Redford in the 2017 romantic drama film &quot;Our Souls at Night&quot;. The film and Fonda&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim upon release. In 2018, she starred opposite Diane Keaton, Mary Steenburgen, and Candice Bergen in the romantic comedy film &quot;Book Club&quot;. Although opened to mixed reviews, the film was a major box office success grossing $93.4 million against a $10 million budget, despite releasing the same day as &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;. Fonda is the subject of an HBO original documentary entitled &quot;Jane Fonda in Five Acts&quot;, directed by the documentarian Susan Lacy. Receiving rave reviews, it covers Fonda&#x27;s life from childhood through her acting career and political activism and then to the present day. It premiered on HBO on September 24, 2018.

Fonda filmed the seventh and final season of &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; in 2021, finishing production in November. The first four episodes premiered August 14, 2021, with the final 12 released on Netflix on April 29, 2022. In November 2021, it was announced Fonda would be in the second installment of Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s &quot;Yearly Departed&quot;. She appeared alongside the host Yvonne Orji, and fellow eulogy givers Chelsea Peretti, Megan Stalter, Dulcé Sloan, Aparna Nancherla, and X Mayo. It premiered on December 23, 2021.

Fonda joined the cast of the 2023 film &quot;80 for Brady&quot;, which pairs her with veteran actresses Lily Tomlin, Rita Moreno, and Sally Field. It also stars former NFL Quarterback, Tom Brady. She and Tomlin headline Paul Weitz&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Moving On&quot;, co-starring Malcolm McDowell and Richard Roundtree. Her third project for 2023 is &quot;Book Club: The Next Chapter&quot;, which she made in Italy.

== Political activism ==
During the 1960s, Fonda engaged in political activism in support of the Civil Rights Movement, and in opposition to the Vietnam War. Fonda&#x27;s visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as &quot;small-c communism&quot;. Along with other celebrities, she supported the Occupation of Alcatraz Island by members of the American Indian Movement in 1969, which was intended to call attention to the failures of the government with regard to treaty rights and the movement for greater Indigenous sovereignty.

She supported Huey Newton and the Black Panthers in the early 1970s, stating: &quot;Revolution is an act of love; we are the children of revolution, born to be rebels. It runs in our blood.&quot; She called the Black Panthers &quot;our revolutionary vanguard ... we must support them with love, money, propaganda and risk.&quot; She has been involved in the feminist movement since the 1970s and dovetails her activism in support of civil rights.

Fonda and Barbra Streisand joined with ten other women in the entertainment industry of Greater Los Angeles to establish the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Political Committee (HWPC) in 1984. The committee&#x27;s initial goal was to assist in the presidential campaign of Walter Mondale and his running mate Geraldine Ferraro. The Mondale–Ferraro ticket failed against incumbents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, but HWPC retrenched itself with a list of New Left political goals, and helped to turn the Senate Democratic in 1986. In 1992, HWPC helped to elect a record-breaking number of women legislators, an achievement called the Year of the Woman. Described by observers as carrying forward the same political goals as Fonda and Streisand, HWPC continued its activism through political setbacks of 1994 and 1996, finally dissolving in 1997. During their run, the HWPC was called &quot;the single most-powerful entertainment group&quot; in politics.

===Opposition to the Vietnam War===

On May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, to speak on G.I. rights and issues. The end of her presentation was met with a discomfiting silence until Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage, drunk. He challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: why hadn&#x27;t she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? In her autobiography, Fonda revisited the incident: &quot;I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool.&quot; On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president Ferrel Heady. The protesters called themselves &quot;They Shoot Students, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; – a reference to Fonda&#x27;s recently released film, &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;, which had just been screened in Albuquerque.

In the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW and was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator. That fall, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Fonda was a &quot;major patron&quot; of the VVAW.

In 1971, Fonda, with Fred Gardner and Donald Sutherland formed the FTA tour (&quot;Free The Army&quot;, a play on the troop expression &quot;Fuck The Army&quot;), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to Bob Hope&#x27;s USO tour. The tour, described as &quot;political vaudeville&quot; by Fonda, visited military towns along the West Coast, aiming to establish a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (&quot;F.T.A.&quot;) which contained strong, frank criticism of the war by servicemembers; it was released in 1972.

====Visit to Hanoi====
Between 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans – mostly civil rights activists, teachers, and pastors – traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war situation with the Vietnamese, believing that the news media in the United States predominantly provided a U.S. viewpoint. American travelers to North Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return home. Fonda visited Vietnam in July 1972, traveling to Hanoi to witness the bombing damage to the dikes. After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River. Sweden&#x27;s ambassador to Vietnam likewise observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as &quot;methodic&quot;. Other journalists reported that the attacks were &quot;aimed at the whole system of dikes&quot;. Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S. Air Force were &quot;truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way&quot;. Due to the publicity surrounding Fonda&#x27;s visit, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assessed aerial photography of the North Vietnamese dike system in a secret 1972 report, arriving at two conclusions: First, that the North Vietnamese dike system was incredibly robust, meaning it would be costly to attack and easy to repair. They noted that &quot;A crew of less than 50 men with wheelbarrows and hand tools probably could repair in one day the largest crater observed.&quot; Second, they found that &quot;all the damaged sections of dikes are close to valid military-related targets&quot;, and not in areas that would cause the most damage to the dike system. Thus the CIA argued that &quot;A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam&#x27;s vital dike system.&quot; French geographer Yves Lacoste published an analysis in 1973 which concluded the dike system was intentionally targeted in the eastern region of the delta, with bombs consistently targeting the most vulnerable concave sections, and resulted in critical sub-surface damage which left them vulnerable to failure in subsequent flooding.

Fonda was photographed seated on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun; the photo outraged a number of Americans, and earned her the nickname &quot;Hanoi Jane&quot;. In her 2005 autobiography, she wrote that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery; she had been horrified at the implications of the pictures. In a 2011 entry on her official website, Fonda explained:

It happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit ... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day &#x27;Uncle Ho&#x27; declared their country&#x27;s independence in Hanoi&#x27;s Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: &#x27;All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.&#x27; These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. &#x27;These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.&#x27; The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return ... I memorized a song called &#x27;Dậy mà đi&#x27; [&quot;Get up and go&quot;], written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me ... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don&#x27;t remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed ... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can&#x27;t blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen ... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever ... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.

Fonda made radio broadcasts on Hanoi Radio throughout her two-week tour, describing her visits to villages, hospitals, schools, and factories that had been bombed, and denouncing U.S. military policy. During the course of her visit, Fonda visited American prisoners of war (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda said that those making such claims were &quot;hypocrites and liars and pawns&quot;, adding about the prisoners she visited, &quot;These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed.&quot; In addition, Fonda told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1973, &quot;I&#x27;m quite sure that there were incidents of torture ... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that&#x27;s a lie.&quot; Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent rumors that prisoners had been coerced into meeting with Fonda by the North Vietnamese with torture, which were repeated widely, and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later. Fonda, as well as the named POWs, have denied the rumors, and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these allegations to be false—the persons named had never met Fonda.

In 1972, Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign, which continued to mobilize antiwar activists in the US after the 1973 Paris Peace Agreement, until 1975 when the United States withdrew from Vietnam. Because of her tour of North Vietnam during wartime and the subsequent rumors, resentment against her persists among some veterans and serving U.S. military. For example, when a U.S. Naval Academy plebe ritually shouted out &quot;Goodnight, Jane Fonda!&quot;, the entire company of midshipmen plebes replied &quot;Goodnight, bitch!&quot; This practice has since been prohibited by the academy&#x27;s &quot;Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures&quot;. In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda&#x27;s face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, &quot;My Life So Far&quot;. He told reporters that he &quot;consider[ed] it a debt of honor&quot;, adding &quot;she spit in our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did.&quot; Fonda refused to press charges.

====Regrets====
In a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:

I would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I&#x27;m very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. ... I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.

In a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a &quot;betrayal&quot; of American forces and of the &quot;country that gave me privilege&quot;. Fonda said, &quot;The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda&#x27;s daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine.&quot; She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: &quot;There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It&#x27;s not something that I will apologize for.&quot; Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: &quot;Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war.&quot;

===Subject of government surveillance===
In 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as part of Project MINARET, a program that some NSA officials have described as &quot;disreputable if not downright illegal&quot;. Fonda&#x27;s communications, as well as those of her husband, Tom Hayden, were intercepted by Britain&#x27;s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Under the UKUSA Agreement, intercepted data on Americans were sent to the U.S. government.

===1970 arrest===
On November 2, 1970, Fonda was arrested by authorities at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on suspicion of drug trafficking. Her luggage was searched when she re-entered the United States after participating in an anti-war college speaking tour in Canada, and several small baggies containing pills were seized. Although Fonda protested that the pills were harmless vitamins, she was booked by police and then released on bond. Fonda alleged that the arresting officer told her he was acting on direct orders from the Nixon White House. As she wrote in 2009, &quot;I told them what [the vitamins] were but they said they were getting orders from the White House. I think they hoped this &#x27;scandal&#x27; would cause the college speeches to be canceled and ruin my respectability.&quot; After lab tests confirmed the pills were vitamins, the charges were dropped with little media attention.

Fonda&#x27;s mugshot from the arrest, in which she raises her fist in a sign of solidarity, has since become a widely published image of the actress. It was used as the poster image for the 2018 HBO documentary on Fonda, &quot;Jane Fonda in Five Acts&quot;, with a giant billboard sporting the image erected in Times Square in September 2018. In 2017, she began selling merchandise with her mugshot image to benefit the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power &amp; Potential.

===Feminist causes===
In a 2017 interview with Brie Larson, published by &quot;People&quot; magazine, Fonda stated, &quot;One of the great things the women&#x27;s movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it&#x27;s not right.&quot; She said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been raped, I&#x27;ve been sexually abused as a child and I&#x27;ve been fired because I wouldn&#x27;t sleep with my boss.&quot; She said, &quot;I always thought it was my fault; that I didn&#x27;t do or say the right thing. I know young girls who&#x27;ve been raped and didn&#x27;t even know it was rape. They think, &#x27;It must have been because I said &#x27;no&#x27; the wrong way.&#x27;&quot;

Through her work, Fonda said she wants to help abuse victims &quot;realize that [rape and abuse] is not our fault&quot;. Fonda said that her difficult past led her to become such a passionate activist for women&#x27;s rights. The actress is an active supporter of the V-Day movement, which works to stop violence against women and girls. In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health, which aims to help prevent teen pregnancy. She said she was &quot;brought up with the disease to please&quot; in her early life. Fonda revealed in 2014 that her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, was recurrently sexually abused as young as eight, and this may have led to her suicide when Jane was 12.

Fonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including V-Day, of which she is an honorary chairperson, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. She was at the first summit in 2002, bringing together founder Eve Ensler, Afghan women oppressed by the Taliban, and a Kenyan activist campaigning to save girls from genital mutilation.

In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta to help prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development. On February 16, 2004, Fonda led a march through Ciudad Juárez, with Sally Field, Eve Ensler and other women, urging Mexico to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials in helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city. In 2004, she also served as a mentor to the first all-transgender cast of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. In the days before the September 17, 2006, Swedish elections, Fonda went to Sweden to support the new political party Feministiskt initiativ in their election campaign.

In &quot;My Life So Far&quot;, Fonda stated that she considers patriarchy to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were &quot;anti-male&quot;. But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she &quot;still loves men&quot;, adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.

In April 2016, Fonda said that while she was &#x27;glad&#x27; that Bernie Sanders was running, she predicted Hillary Clinton would become the first female president, whose supposed win Fonda believed would result in a &quot;violent backlash.&quot; Clinton did not become president and got defeated by Republican Party&#x27;s nominee businessman Donald Trump in the general election later that year. Fonda went on to say that we need to &quot;help men understand why they are so threatened – and change the way we view masculinity&quot;. In March 2020, Fonda endorsed Sanders for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 election, calling him the &quot;climate candidate.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s Media Center===
In 2005, along with Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, she cofounded the Women&#x27;s Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves on the board of the organization. Based in Los Angeles, she has lived all over the world, including six years in France and 20 in Atlanta.

===LGBTQ+ support===
Fonda has publicly shown her support of the LGBTQ+ community many times throughout her career. In August 2021, Fonda, the cast of &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, and other advocates joined to support a fundraiser hosted by the Los Angeles LGBT Center to help members of the LGBTQ+ community during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fonda spoke out as an LGBTQ+ ally long before it was common. She appeared in a video of a 1979 interview during the White Night Riots in San Francisco after the assassination of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician in California. During the interview she was asked if the gay community was still being discriminated against, to which she replied that they &quot;are culturally, psychologically, economically, politically&quot; being discriminated against. Fonda was then asked if the gay community has used her as an advocate and she replied that she hopes they will use her, though she stressed that &quot;they are a very powerful movement, they don&#x27;t need me, but they like me (and) they know by working together we can be stronger than either entity is by itself.&quot;

===Native Americans===
Fonda went to Seattle in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by Bernie Whitebear. The group had occupied part of the grounds of Fort Lawton, which was in the process of being surplussed by the United States Army and turned into a park. The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local urban Indian population, protesting that &quot;Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs.&quot; The endeavor succeeded and the Daybreak Star Cultural Center was constructed in the city&#x27;s Discovery Park.

In addition to environmental reasons, Fonda has been a critic of oil pipelines because of their being built without consent on Native American tribal land. In 2017, Fonda responded to American President Donald Trump&#x27;s mandate to resume construction of the controversial North Dakota Pipelines by saying that Trump &quot;does this illegally because he has not gotten consent from the tribes through whose countries this goes&quot; and pointing out that &quot;the U.S. has agreed to treaties that require them to get the consent of the people who are affected, the indigenous people who live there.&quot;

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
In December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp.

In September 2009, she was one of more than 1,500 signatories to a letter protesting the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival&#x27;s spotlight on Tel Aviv. The protest letter said that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of &quot;the Israeli propaganda machine&quot; because it was supported in part by funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from Israel&#x27;s conflict with the Palestinians. Other signers included actor Danny Glover, musician David Byrne, journalist John Pilger, and authors Alice Walker, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.

Fonda, in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, said she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it &quot;was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers.&quot; She continued, writing &quot;the greatest &#x27;re-branding&#x27; of Israel would be to celebrate that country&#x27;s long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That&#x27;s the way to show Israel&#x27;s commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens.&quot; Fonda emphasized that she, &quot;in no way, support[s] the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people.&quot; Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as &quot;a strong supporter and friend of Israel&quot;.

===Opposition to the Iraq War===

Fonda argued that the Iraq War would turn people all over the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan&#x27;s activism.

In September 2005, Fonda was scheduled to join British politician and anti-war activist George Galloway at two stops on his U.S. book tour—Chicago, and Madison, Wisconsin. She canceled her appearances at the last minute, citing instructions from her doctors to avoid travel following recent hip surgery. On January 27, 2007, Fonda participated in an anti-war rally and march held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., declaring that &quot;silence is no longer an option&quot;. She spoke at an anti-war rally earlier that day at the Navy Memorial, where members of the organization Free Republic picketed in a counter protest.

===Fonda and Kerry===
In the 2004 presidential election, her name was used as a disparaging epithet against John Kerry, a former VVAW leader, who was then the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie called Kerry a &quot;Jane Fonda Democrat&quot;. Kerry&#x27;s opponents also circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, though they sat several rows apart. A faked composite photograph, which gave a false impression that the two had shared a speaker&#x27;s platform, was also circulated.

===Environmentalism===
In 2015, Fonda expressed disapproval of President Barack Obama&#x27;s permitting of Arctic drilling (Petroleum exploration in the Arctic) at the Sundance Film Festival. In July, she marched in a Toronto protest called the &quot;March for Jobs, Justice, and Climate&quot;, which was organized by dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and environmental activists, including Canadian author Naomi Klein. The march aimed to show businesses and politicians alike that climate change is inherently linked to issues that may seem unrelated.

In addition to issues of civil rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau &quot;talked so beautifully of needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people ... and yet he has betrayed every one of the things he committed to in Paris.&quot;

Since at least 2019, she has been a supporter of global environmental organizations including GreenFaith and 350.org. She spoke at the Fire Drill Fridays protest in Washington, D.C. wherein protestors condemned expansion of the fossil fuel industry.

In October 2019, Fonda was arrested three times in consecutive weeks protesting climate change outside the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. She was arrested with members of the group Oil Change International on October 11, with &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; co-star Sam Waterston on October 18, and with actor Ted Danson on October 25. On November 1, Fonda was arrested for the fourth consecutive Friday; also arrested were Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette. On December 5, 2019, Fonda explained her position in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed. In March 2022, Fonda launched the Jane Fonda Climate PAC, a political action committee with the purpose of ousting politicians supporting the fossil fuel industry.

In September 2023, she participated in New York City&#x27;s March to End Fossil Fuels. In 2024, she was a featured guest at 350.org&#x27;s Food &amp; Water Watch event.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
In September 2024, Fonda joined over 125 actors, directors, and musicians in signing an open letter urging Governor Gavin Newsom to sign SB 1047, a Californian AI safety bill that would, amongst other things, hold companies training the largest AI models liable if their models cause mass casualties or over $500 million in damages. The letter, also signed by figures such as Alec Baldwin, Pedro Pascal and Kelly Rowland, said that the &quot;Grave threats from AI used to be the stuff of science fiction, but not anymore,&quot; and that AI companies should implement &quot;reasonable safeguards&quot; against those risks.

== Other activities ==

===Writing===
On April 5, 2005, Random House published Fonda&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Life So Far&quot;. The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third &quot;act&quot; will be her most significant, partly because of her commitment to Christianity, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered.

Fonda&#x27;s autobiography was well received by book critics and noted to be &quot;as beguiling and as maddening as Jane Fonda herself&quot; in its review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, calling her a &quot;beautiful bundle of contradictions&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the book &quot;achingly poignant&quot;.

In January 2009, Fonda began chronicling her return to Broadway in a blog with posts about topics ranging from her Pilates class to fears and excitement about her new play. She uses Twitter and has a Facebook page. In 2011, Fonda published a new book: &quot;Prime Time: Love, health, sex, fitness, friendship, spirit – making the most of all of your life&quot;. It offers stories from her own life as well as from the lives of others, giving her perspective on how to better live what she calls &quot;the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond&quot;. On September 8, 2020, HarperCollins published Fonda&#x27;s book, &quot;What Can I Do?: The Truth About Climate Change and How to Fix It&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
Fonda&#x27;s charitable works have focused on youth and education, adolescent reproductive health, environment, human services, and the arts. Fonda marketed her highly successful line of exercise videos and books in order to fund the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a California lobbying organization she founded with her second husband Tom Hayden in 1978. Fonda has established the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential (GCAPP) in the mid-1990s and the Fonda Family Foundation in the late 1990s. In the mid-2000s, Fonda founded the Jane Fonda Foundation in 2004 with one million dollars of her own money as a charitable corporation with herself as president, chair, director, and secretary; Fonda contributes 10 hours each week on its behalf. In 2017, she began selling merchandise featuring her 1970 arrest mugshot on her website, the proceeds of which benefit GCAPP.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===
Fonda writes in her autobiography that she lost her virginity at age 18 to actor James Franciscus. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, she dated automobile racing manager Giovanni Volpi, producers José Antonio Sainz de Vicuña and Sandy Whitelaw as well as actors Warren Beatty, Peter Mann, Christian Marquand and William Wellman Jr. During this time, she often bearded for closeted homosexuals, including dancer Timmy Everett, theater director Andreas Voutsinas and actor Earl Holliman.

Fonda and her first husband, French film director Roger Vadim, became an item in December 1963 and married on August 14, 1965, at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas. The couple had a daughter, Vanessa Vadim, born on September 28, 1968, in Boulogne-Billancourt and named after actress and activist Vanessa Redgrave. Separation reports surfaced in March 1970, which Fonda&#x27;s spokesman called &quot;totally untrue&quot;, though by mid-1972 she was conceding: &quot;We&#x27;re separated. Not legally, just separated. We&#x27;re friends.&quot; In the early 1970s, Fonda had affairs with political organizer Fred Gardner and &quot;Klute&quot; co-star Donald Sutherland.

On January 19, 1973, three days after obtaining a divorce from Vadim in Santo Domingo, Fonda married activist Tom Hayden in a free-form ceremony at her home in Laurel Canyon. She had become involved with Hayden the previous summer and was three months pregnant when they married. Their son, Troy O&#x27;Donovan Garity, was born on July 7, 1973, in Los Angeles and was given his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name, as the names &quot;Fonda and Hayden carried too much baggage.&quot; Fonda and Hayden named their son for Nguyễn Văn Trỗi, the Viet Cong member who had attempted to assassinate US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. Hayden chose O&#x27;Donovan as the middle name after Irish revolutionary Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa. In 1982, Fonda and Hayden unofficially adopted an African-American teenager, Mary Luana Williams (known as Lulu), whose parents were Black Panthers. Fonda and Hayden separated over the Christmas holiday of 1988 and divorced on June 10, 1990, in Santa Monica. In 1989, while estranged from Hayden, Fonda had a seven-month relationship with soccer player Lorenzo Caccialanza. She was linked with actor Rob Lowe that same year.

Fonda married her third husband, cable television tycoon and CNN founder Ted Turner, on December 21, 1991, at a ranch near Capps, Florida, about 20 miles east of Tallahassee. The pair separated in 2000 and divorced on May 22, 2001, in Atlanta. Seven years of celibacy followed, then from 2007 to 2008 Fonda was the companion of widowered management consultant Lynden Gillis. In mid-2009, Fonda began a relationship with record producer Richard Perry. It ended in January 2017. That December, when asked what she had learned about love, Fonda told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;: &quot;Nothing. I&#x27;m not cut out for it!&quot;

In a 2018 interview, Fonda stated that up to age 62, she always felt she had to seek the validation of men in order to prove to herself that she had value as a person, something she attributes to her mother&#x27;s early death leaving her without a female role model. As a consequence, she attached herself to &quot;alpha males&quot;, some of whom reinforced her feelings of inadequacy, despite her professional success. Fonda said that she came to see that attitude as a failing of the men in her life: &quot;Some men have a hard time realizing that the woman they&#x27;re married to is strong and smart and they have to diminish that, because it makes them feel diminished. Too bad we have defined masculinity in such a way that it&#x27;s so easily shamed.&quot; In 2018 she said, &quot;I&#x27;m not dating anymore, but I did up until a couple of years ago. I&#x27;m 80; I&#x27;ve closed up shop down there.&quot;

===Faith and activism===
Fonda grew up atheist but turned to Christianity in the early 2000s. She describes her beliefs as being &quot;outside of established religion&quot; with a more feminist slant and views God as something that &quot;lives within each of us as Spirit (or soul)&quot;. Fonda once refused to say &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; in &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; and the script was changed. She practices zazen and yoga.

===Health===
As a child, Fonda suffered from a poor self-image and lacked confidence in her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. About that, Fonda said:
I was raised in the &#x27;50s. I was taught by my father [actor Henry Fonda] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you&#x27;re not going to be loved.In another interview with Oprah Winfrey, Fonda confessed, after years of struggling with her self-image, &quot;It took me a long long time to realize we&#x27;re not meant to be perfect, we&#x27;re meant to be whole.&quot; In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia, which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour, who died by suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said,

It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout ... I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die.

Fonda was diagnosed with breast cancer and osteoporosis in her later years. She underwent a lumpectomy in November 2010 and recovered. In April 2019, Fonda revealed she had a cancerous growth removed from her lower lip the previous year and pre-melanoma growths removed from her skin. On September 2, 2022, Fonda announced that she has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and that she had begun chemotherapy treatments, expected to last six months. On December 15, 2022, Fonda stated that her cancer was in remission and that her chemotherapy would be discontinued.

<doc id="63522" wikidata="Q1472" url="?curid=63522" title="Crohn's disease">
<text>Crohn&#x27;s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer.

Although the precise causes of Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD) are unknown, it is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental, immune, and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body&#x27;s immune system defends the gastrointestinal tract, possibly targeting microbial antigens. While Crohn&#x27;s is an immune-related disease, it does not seem to be an autoimmune disease (the immune system is not triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune problem is not clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state.

About half of the overall risk is related to genetics, with more than 70 genes involved. Tobacco smokers are three times as likely to develop Crohn&#x27;s disease as non-smokers. Crohn&#x27;s disease is often triggered after a gastroenteritis episode. Other conditions with similar symptoms include irritable bowel syndrome and Behçet&#x27;s disease.

There is no known cure for Crohn&#x27;s disease. Treatment options are intended to help with symptoms, maintain remission, and prevent relapse. In those newly diagnosed, a corticosteroid may be used for a brief period of time to improve symptoms rapidly, alongside another medication such as either methotrexate or a thiopurine to prevent recurrence. Cessation of smoking is recommended for people with Crohn&#x27;s disease. One in five people with the disease is admitted to the hospital each year, and half of those with the disease will require surgery at some time during a ten-year period. Surgery should be minimized whenever possible, but it is sometimes essential for treating abscesses, certain bowel obstructions, and cancers. Checking for bowel cancer via colonoscopy is recommended every 1-3 years, starting eight years after the disease has begun.

Crohn&#x27;s disease affects about 3.2 per 1,000 people in Europe and North America; it is less common in Asia and Africa. It has historically been more common in the developed world. Rates have, however, been increasing, particularly in the developing world, since the 1970s. Inflammatory bowel disease resulted in 47,400 deaths in 2015, and those with Crohn&#x27;s disease have a slightly reduced life expectancy. Onset of Crohn&#x27;s disease tends to start in adolescence and young adulthood, though it can occur at any age. Males and females are affected roughly equally.
== Name controversy ==
The disease was named after gastroenterologist Burrill Bernard Crohn, who in 1932, together with Leon Ginzburg (1898–1988) and Gordon D. Oppenheimer (1900–1974) at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, described a series of patients with inflammation of the terminal ileum of the small intestine, the area most commonly affected by the illness. The decision to name the disease after Crohn remains controversial While Crohn, in his memoir, describes his original investigation of the disease, Ginzburg provided strong evidence of how he and Oppenheimer were the first to study the disease.

== Signs and symptoms ==
=== Gastrointestinal ===

Many people with Crohn&#x27;s disease have symptoms for years before the diagnosis. The usual onset is in the teens and twenties, but can occur at any age. Because of the &#x27;patchy&#x27; nature of the gastrointestinal disease and the depth of tissue involvement, initial symptoms can be more subtle than those of ulcerative colitis. People with Crohn&#x27;s disease experience chronic recurring periods of flare-ups and remission. The symptoms experienced can change over time as inflammation increases and spreads. Symptoms can also be different depending on which organs are involved. It is generally thought that the presentation of Crohn&#x27;s disease is different for each patient due to the high variability of symptoms, organ involvement, and initial presentation.

=== Perianal ===
Perianal discomfort may also be prominent in Crohn&#x27;s disease. Itchiness or pain around the anus may be suggestive of inflammation of the anus, or perianal complications such as anal fissures, fistulae, or abscesses around the anal area. Perianal skin tags are also common in Crohn&#x27;s disease, and may appear with or without the presence of colorectal polyps. Fecal incontinence may accompany perianal Crohn&#x27;s disease.

=== Intestines ===
The intestines, especially the colon and terminal ileum, are the areas of the body affected most commonly. Abdominal pain is a common initial symptom of Crohn&#x27;s disease, especially in the lower right abdomen. Flatulence, bloating, and abdominal distension are additional symptoms and may also add to the intestinal discomfort. Pain is often accompanied by non-bloody diarrhea, however in some cases the diarrhea can be bloody. Inflammation in different areas of the intestinal tract can affect the quality of the feces. Ileitis typically results in large-volume, watery feces, while colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of greater frequency. Fecal consistency may range from solid to watery. In severe cases, an individual may have more than 20 bowel movements per day, and may need to awaken at night to defecate. Visible bleeding in the feces is less common in Crohn&#x27;s disease than in ulcerative colitis, but is not unusual. Bloody bowel movements are usually intermittent, and may be bright red, dark maroon, or even black in color. The color of bloody stool depends on the location of the bleed. In severe Crohn&#x27;s colitis, bleeding may be copious.

=== Stomach and esophagus===
The stomach is rarely the sole or predominant site of CD. To date, there are only a few documented case reports of adults with isolated gastric CD and no reports in the pediatric population. Isolated stomach involvement is very unusual presentation accounting for less than 0.07% of all gastrointestinal CD. However, the esophagus and stomach are increasingly understood to be affected in patients with intestinal CD. Recent studies suggest upper GI involvement occurs in 13-16% of cases, typically presenting after distal symptoms. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms may include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), painful swallowing (odynophagia), upper abdominal pain, and vomiting.

===Oropharynx (mouth)===
The mouth may be affected by recurrent canker sores (aphthous ulcers). Recurrent aphthous ulcers are common; however, it is not clear whether this is due to Crohn&#x27;s disease or simply that they are common in the general population. Other findings may include diffuse or nodular swelling of the mouth, a cobblestone appearance inside the mouth, granulomatous ulcers, or pyostomatitis vegetans. Medications that are commonly prescribed to treat CD, such as anti-inflammatory and sulfa-containing drugs, may cause lichenoid drug reactions in the mouth. Fungal infection such as candidiasis is also common due to the immunosuppression required in the treatment of the disease. Signs of anemia such as pallor and angular cheilitis or glossitis are also common due to nutritional malabsorption.

People with Crohn&#x27;s disease are also susceptible to angular stomatitis, an inflammation of the corners of the mouth, and pyostomatitis vegetans.

=== Systemic ===
Like many other chronic, inflammatory diseases, Crohn&#x27;s disease can cause a variety of systemic symptoms. Among children, growth failure is common. Many children are first diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease based on inability to maintain growth. As it may manifest at the time of the growth spurt in puberty, as many as 30% of children with Crohn&#x27;s disease may have retardation of growth. Fever may also be present, though fevers greater than 38.5 °C (101.3 °F) are uncommon unless there is a complication such as an abscess. Among older individuals, Crohn&#x27;s disease may manifest as weight loss, usually related to decreased food intake, since individuals with intestinal symptoms from Crohn&#x27;s disease often feel better when they do not eat and might lose their appetite. People with extensive small intestine disease may also have malabsorption of carbohydrates or lipids, which can further exacerbate weight loss.

=== Extraintestinal ===
Crohn&#x27;s disease can affect many organ systems beyond the gastrointestinal tract.
====Visual====

Inflammation of the interior portion of the eye, known as uveitis, can cause blurred vision and eye pain, especially when exposed to light (photophobia). Uveitis can lead to loss of vision if untreated.

Inflammation may also involve the white part of the eye (sclera) or the overlying connective tissue (episclera), which causes conditions called scleritis and episcleritis, respectively.

Other very rare ophthalmological manifestations include: conjunctivitis, glaucoma, and retinal vascular disease.

The pathophysiology of ocular inflammation in Crohn&#x27;s disease patients is complex and remains uncertain. The association between inflammatory conditions of the eye and Crohn&#x27;s disease is due to many Crohn&#x27;s disease patients having genetic markers such as HLA-B07, HLA-B27 and HLA-DRB1*0103. Additionally, cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 which are produced in the bowel enter the circulatory system and travel to the eyes to trigger inflammation.

====Gallbladder and liver====

Crohn&#x27;s disease that affects the ileum may result in an increased risk of gallstones. This is due to a decrease in bile acid resorption in the ileum, resulting in bile excretion n the stool. As a result, the cholesterol/bile ratio increases in the gallbladder, resulting in an increased risk for gallstones. Although the association is greater in the context of ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#x27;s disease may also be associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis, a type of inflammation of the bile ducts. Specifically, 0.96% of Crohn&#x27;s disease patients also have primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Liver involvement of Crohn&#x27;s disease can include cirrhosis and steatosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NAFLD) are relatively common and can slowly progress to end-stage liver disease. NAFLD sensitizes the liver to injury and increases the risk of developing acute or chronic liver failure following another liver injury.

Other rare hepatobiliary manifestations of Crohn&#x27;s disease include: cholangiocarcinoma, granulomatous hepatitis, cholelithiasis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic abscess, and pericholangitis.

====Renal and urological====

Nephrolithiasis, obstructive uropathy, and fistulization of the urinary tract directly result from the underlying disease process. Nephrolithiasis is due to calcium oxalate or uric acid stones. Calcium oxalate stones due to hyperoxaluria are typically associated with either distal ileal CD or ileal resection. Oxalate absorption increases in the presence of unabsorbed fatty acids in the colon. The fatty acids compete with oxalate to bind calcium, displacing the oxalate, which can then be absorbed as unbound sodium oxalate across colonocytes and excreted into the urine. Because sodium oxalate is only absorbed in the colon, calcium oxalate stones form only in patients with an intact colon. Patients with an ileostomy are prone to formation of uric acid stones because of frequent dehydration. The sudden onset of severe abdominal, back, or flank pain in patients with IBD, particularly if different from the usual discomfort, should lead to inclusion of a renal stone in the differential diagnosis.

Urological manifestations in patients with IBD may include ureteral calculi, enterovesical fistula, perivesical infection, perinephric abscess, and obstructive uropathy with hydronephrosis. Ureteral compression is associated with retroperitoneal extension of the phlegmonous inflammatory process involving the terminal ileum and cecum, and may result in hydronephrosis severe enough to cause hypertension.

Immune complex glomerulonephritis presenting with proteinuria and hematuria has been described in children and adults with CD or UC. Diagnosis is by renal biopsy, and treatment parallels the underlying IBD.

Amyloidosis (see endocrinological involvement) secondary to Crohn&#x27;s disease has been described and is known to affect the kidneys.

====Pancreatic====

Pancreatitis may be associated with both UC and CD. The most common cause is iatrogenic and involves sensitivity to medications used to treat IBD (3% of patients), including sulfasalazine, mesalamine, 6-mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Pancreatitis may present as symptomatic (in 2%) or more commonly asymptomatic (8–21%) disease in adults with IBD.

====Cardiovascular and circulatory====

Children and adults with IBD have been rarely (&lt;1%) reported developing pleuropericarditis either at initial presentation or during active or quiescent disease. The pathogenesis of pleuropericarditis is unknown, although certain medications (e.g., sulfasalazine and mesalamine derivatives) have been implicated in some cases. The clinical presentation may include chest pain, dyspnea, or in severe cases pericardial tamponade requiring rapid drainage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been used as therapy, although this should be weighed against the hypothetical risk of exacerbating the underlying IBD.

In rare cases, cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, and myocarditis have been described.

Crohn&#x27;s disease also increases the risk of blood clots; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of deep venous thrombosis, while difficulty breathing may be a result of pulmonary embolism.

====Respiratory====

Laryngeal involvement in inflammatory bowel disease is extremely rare. Only 12 cases of laryngeal involvement in Crohn&#x27;s disease have been reported . Moreover, only one case of laryngeal manifestations in ulcerative colitis has been reported as of the same date. Nine patients complained of difficulty in breathing due to edema and ulceration from the larynx to the hypopharynx. Hoarseness, sore throat, and odynophagia are other symptoms of laryngeal involvement of Crohn&#x27;s disease.

Considering extraintestinal manifestations of CD, those involving the lung are relatively rare. However, there is a wide array of lung manifestations, ranging from subclinical alterations, airway diseases and lung parenchymal diseases to pleural diseases and drug-related diseases. The most frequent manifestation is bronchial inflammation and suppuration with or without bronchiectasis. There are a number of mechanisms by which the lungs may become involved in CD. These include the same embryological origin of the lung and gastrointestinal tract by ancestral intestine, similar immune systems in the pulmonary and intestinal mucosa, the presence of circulating immune complexes and auto-antibodies, and the adverse pulmonary effects of some drugs. A complete list of known pulmonary manifestations include: fibrosing alveolitis, pulmonary vasculitis, apical fibrosis, bronchiectasis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, tracheal stenosis, granulomatous lung disease, and abnormal pulmonary function.

====Musculoskeletal====

Crohn&#x27;s disease is associated with a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative spondyloarthropathy. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more joints (arthritis) or muscle insertions (enthesitis). The arthritis in Crohn&#x27;s disease can be divided into two types. The first type affects larger weight-bearing joints such as the knee (most common), hips, shoulders, wrists, or elbows. The second type symmetrically involves five or more of the small joints of the hands and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to ankylosing spondylitis if the entire spine is involved, or simply sacroiliitis if only the sacroiliac joint is involved.

Crohn&#x27;s disease increases the risk of osteoporosis or thinning of the bones. Individuals with osteoporosis are at increased risk of bone fractures.

====Dermatological====
Crohn&#x27;s disease may also involve the skin, blood, and endocrine system. Erythema nodosum is the most common type of skin problem, occurring in around 8% of people with Crohn&#x27;s disease, producing raised, tender red nodules usually appearing on the shins. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue, and is characterized by septal panniculitis.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a less common skin problem, occurring in under 2%, and is typically a painful ulcerating nodule.

Clubbing, a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may also be a result of Crohn&#x27;s disease.

Other very rare dermatological manifestations include: pyostomatitis vegetans, erythema multiforme, epidermolysis bullosa acquista (described in a case report), and metastatic CD (the spread of Crohn&#x27;s inflammation to the skin). It is unknown if Sweet&#x27;s syndrome is connected to Crohn&#x27;s disease.

====Neurological====

Crohn&#x27;s disease can also cause neurological complications (reportedly in up to 15% of cases). The most common of these are seizures, stroke, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, headache, and depression.

Central and peripheral neurological disorders are described in patients with IBD and include peripheral neuropathies, myopathies, focal central nervous system defects, convulsions, confusional episodes, meningitis, syncope, optic neuritis, and sensorineural loss. Autoimmune mechanisms are proposed for involvement with IBD. Nutritional deficiencies associated with neurological manifestations, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, should be investigated. Spinal abscess has been reported in both a child and an adult with initial complaints of severe back pain due to extension of a psoas abscess from the epidural space to the subarachnoid space.

====Psychiatric and psychological====

Crohn&#x27;s disease is linked to many psychological disorders, including depression and anxiety, denial of one&#x27;s disease, the need for dependence or dependent behaviors, feeling overwhelmed, and having a poor self-image.

Many studies have found that patients with IBD report a higher frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders than the general population; most studies confirm that women with IBD are more likely than men to develop affective disorders and show that up to 65% of them may have depression and anxiety disorder.

====Endocrinological or hematological====

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which the immune system attacks the red blood cells, is also more common in Crohn&#x27;s disease and may cause fatigue, a pale appearance, and other symptoms common in anemia.

Secondary amyloidosis (AA) is another rare but serious complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), generally seen in Crohn&#x27;s disease. At least 1% of patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease develop amyloidosis. In the literature, the time lapse between the onset of Crohn&#x27;s disease and the diagnosis of amyloidosis has been reported to range from 1 to 21 years.

Leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia are usually due to immunosuppressant treatments or sulfasalazine. Plasma erythropoietin levels often are lower in patients with IBD than expected, in conjunction with severe anemia.

Thrombocytosis and thromboembolic events resulting from a hypercoagulable state in patients with IBD can lead to pulmonary embolism or thrombosis elsewhere in the body. Thrombosis has been reported in 1.8% of patients with UC and 3.1% of patients with CD. Thromboembolism and thrombosis are less frequently reported among pediatric patients, with three patients with UC and one with CD described in case reports.

In rare cases, hypercoagulation disorders and portal vein thrombosis have been described.

====Malnutrition symptoms====

People with Crohn&#x27;s disease may develop anemia due to vitamin B12, folate, iron deficiency, or due to anemia of chronic disease. The most common is iron deficiency anemia from chronic blood loss, reduced dietary intake, and persistent inflammation leading to increased hepcidin levels, restricting iron absorption in the duodenum. As Crohn&#x27;s disease most commonly affects the terminal ileum where the vitamin B12/intrinsic factor complex is absorbed, B12 deficiency may be seen. This is particularly common after one has had a surgical procedure to remove the ileum. Involvement of the duodenum and jejunum can impair the absorption of many other nutrients including folate. People with Crohn&#x27;s often also have issues with small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome, which can produce micronutrient deficiencies.

=== Complications ===
====Intestinal damage====

Crohn&#x27;s disease can lead to several mechanical complications within the intestines, including obstruction, fistulae, and abscesses. Obstruction typically occurs from strictures or adhesions that narrow the lumen, blocking the passage of the intestinal contents. A fistula can develop between two loops of bowel, between the bowel and bladder, between the bowel and vagina, and between the bowel and skin. Abscesses are walled-off concentrations of infection, which can occur in the abdomen or in the perianal area. Crohn&#x27;s is responsible for 10% of vesicoenteric fistulae, and is the most common cause of ileovesical fistulae.

Symptoms caused by intestinal stenosis, or the tightening and narrowing of the bowel, are also common in Crohn&#x27;s disease. Abdominal pain is often most severe in areas of the bowel with stenosis. Persistent vomiting and nausea may indicate stenosis from small bowel obstruction or disease involving the stomach, pylorus, or duodenum.

Intestinal granulomas are a walled-off portions of the intestine by macrophages in order to isolate infections. Granuloma formation is more often seen in younger patients, and mainly in the severe, active penetrating disease. Granuloma is considered the hallmark of microscopic diagnosis in Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD), but granulomas can be detected in only 21–60% of CD patients.

====Cancer====
Crohn&#x27;s disease also increases the risk of cancer in the area of inflammation. For example, individuals with Crohn&#x27;s disease involving the small bowel are at higher risk for small intestinal cancer. Similarly, people with Crohn&#x27;s colitis have a relative risk of 5.6 for developing colon cancer. Screening for colon cancer with colonoscopy is recommended for anyone who has had Crohn&#x27;s colitis for at least eight years.

Some studies suggest there is a role for chemoprotection in the prevention of colorectal cancer in Crohn&#x27;s involving the colon; two agents have been suggested, folate and mesalamine preparations. Also, immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat this disease may promote developing extra-intestinal cancers.

Some cancers, such as acute myelocytic leukaemia have been described in cases of Crohn&#x27;s disease. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare, lethal disease generally seen in young male patients with inflammatory bowel disease. TNF-α Inhibitor treatments (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, and etanercept) are thought to be the cause of this rare disease.

====Major complications====
Major complications of Crohn&#x27;s disease include bowel obstruction, abscesses, free perforation, and hemorrhage, which in rare cases may be fatal.

====Other complications====
Individuals with Crohn&#x27;s disease are at risk of malnutrition for many reasons, including decreased food intake and malabsorption. The risk increases following resection of the small bowel. Such individuals may require oral supplements to increase their caloric intake, or in severe cases, total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Most people with moderate or severe Crohn&#x27;s disease are referred to a dietitian for assistance in nutrition.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by excessive proliferation of colonic bacterial species in the small bowel. Potential causes of SIBO include fistulae, strictures, or motility disturbances. Hence, patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease are especially predisposed to develop SIBO. As result, CD patients may experience malabsorption and report symptoms such as weight loss, watery diarrhea, meteorism, flatulence, and abdominal pain, mimicking acute flare in these patients.

====Pregnancy====
Crohn&#x27;s disease can be problematic during pregnancy, and some medications can cause adverse outcomes for the fetus or mother. Consultation with an obstetrician and gastroenterologist about Crohn&#x27;s disease and all medications facilitates preventive measures. In some cases, remission occurs during pregnancy. Certain medications can also lower sperm count or otherwise adversely affect a man&#x27;s fertility.

====Ostomy-related complications====
Common complications of an ostomy (a common surgery in Crohn&#x27;s disease) are: mucosal edema, peristomal dermatitis, retraction, ostomy prolapse, mucosal/skin detachment, hematoma, necrosis, parastomal hernia, and stenosis.

== Etiology ==
The etiology of Crohn&#x27;s disease is unknown. Many theories have been disputed, with four main theories hypothesized to be the primary mechanism of Crohn&#x27;s disease. In autoimmune diseases, antibodies and T lymphocytes are the primary mode of inflammation. These cells and bodies are part of the adaptive immune system, or the part of the immune system that learns to fight foreign bodies when first identified. Autoinflammatory diseases are diseases where the innate immune system, or the immune system we are genetically coded with, is designed to attack our own cells. Crohn&#x27;s disease likely has involvement of both the adaptive and innate immune systems.

=== Autoinflammatory theory ===
Crohn&#x27;s disease can be described as a multifactorial autoinflammatory disease. The etiopathogenesis of Crohn&#x27;s disease is still unknown. In any event, a loss of the regulatory capacity of the immune apparatus would be implicated in the onset of the disease. In this respect interestingly enough, as for Blau&#x27;s disease (a monogenic autoinflammatory disease), the NOD2 gene mutations have been linked to Crohn&#x27;s disease. However, in Crohn&#x27;s disease, NOD2 mutations act as a risk factor, being more common among Crohn&#x27;s disease patients than the background population, while in Blau&#x27;s disease NOD2 mutations are linked directly to this syndrome, as it is an autosomal-dominant disease. All this new knowledge in the pathogenesis of Crohn&#x27;s disease allows us to put this multifactorial disease in the group of autoinflammatory syndromes.

Some examples of how the innate immune system affects bowel inflammation have been described. A meta-analysis of CD genome-wide association studies revealed 71 distinct CD-susceptibility loci. Interestingly, three very important CD-susceptibility genes (the intracellular pathogen-recognition receptor, NOD2; the autophagy-related 16-like 1, ATG16L1 and the immunity-related GTPase M, IRGM) are involved in innate immune responses against gut microbiota, while one (the X-box binding protein 1) is involved in regulation of the [adaptive] immune pathway via MHC class II, resulting in autoinflammatory inflammation. Studies have also found that increased ILC3 can overexpress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II. MHC class II can induce CD4+ T cell apoptosis, thus avoiding the T cell response to normal bowel micro bacteria. Further studies of IBD patients compared with non-IBD patients found that the expression of MHC II by ILC3 was significantly reduced in IBD patients, thus causing an immune reaction against intestinal cells or normal bowel bacteria and damaging the intestines. This can also make the intestines more susceptible to environmental factors, such as food or bacteria.

The thinking is that because Crohn&#x27;s disease has strong innate immune system involvement and has NOD2 mutations as a predisposition, Crohn&#x27;s disease is more likely an autoinflammatory disease than an autoimmune disease.

=== Immunodeficiency theory ===

A substantial body of data has emerged in recent years to suggest that the primary defect in Crohn&#x27;s disease is actually one of relative immunodeficiency. This view has been bolstered recently by novel immunological and clinical studies that have confirmed gross aberrations in this early response, consistent with subsequent genetic studies that highlighted molecules important for innate immune function. The suggestion therefore is that Crohn&#x27;s pathogenesis actually results from partial immunodeficiency, a theory that coincides with the frequent recognition of a virtually identical, non-infectious inflammatory bowel disease arising in patients with congenital monogenic disorders impairing phagocyte function.

== Risk factors ==

While the exact cause or causes are unknown, Crohn&#x27;s disease seems to be due to a combination of environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Crohn&#x27;s is the first genetically complex disease in which the relationship between genetic risk factors and the immune system is understood in considerable detail. Each individual risk mutation makes a small contribution to the overall risk of Crohn&#x27;s (approximately 1:200). The genetic data, and direct assessment of immunity, indicates a malfunction in the innate immune system. In this view, the chronic inflammation of Crohn&#x27;s is caused when the adaptive immune system tries to compensate for a deficient innate immune system.

=== Genetics ===

Crohn&#x27;s has a genetic component. Because of this, siblings of known people with Crohn&#x27;s are 30 times more likely to develop Crohn&#x27;s than the general population.

The first mutation found to be associated with Crohn&#x27;s was a frameshift in the NOD2 gene (also known as the CARD15 gene), followed by the discovery of point mutations. Over 30 genes have been associated with Crohn&#x27;s; a biological function is known for most of them. For example, one association is with mutations in the XBP1 gene, which is involved in the unfolded protein response pathway of the endoplasmic reticulum. The gene variants of NOD2/CARD15 seem to be related with small-bowel involvement. Other well documented genes which increase the risk of developing Crohn&#x27;s disease are ATG16L1, IL23R, IRGM, and SLC11A1.
There is considerable overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and mycobacterial infections. Genome-wide association studies have shown that Crohn&#x27;s disease is genetically linked to coeliac disease.

Crohn&#x27;s has been linked to the gene LRRK2 with one variant potentially increasing the risk of developing the disease by 70%, while another lowers it by 25%. The gene is responsible for making a protein, which collects and eliminates waste product in cells, and is also associated with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Immune system ===
There was a prevailing view that Crohn&#x27;s disease is a primary T cell autoimmune disorder; however, a newer theory hypothesizes that Crohn&#x27;s results from an impaired innate immunity. The later hypothesis describes impaired cytokine secretion by macrophages, which contributes to impaired innate immunity and leads to a sustained microbial-induced inflammatory response in the colon, where the bacterial load is high. Another theory is that the inflammation of Crohn&#x27;s was caused by an overactive Th1 and Th17 cytokine response.

In 2007, the ATG16L1 gene was implicated in Crohn&#x27;s disease, which may induce autophagy and hinder the body&#x27;s ability to attack invasive bacteria. Another study theorized that the human immune system traditionally evolved with the presence of parasites inside the body and that the lack thereof due to modern hygiene standards has weakened the immune system. Test subjects were reintroduced to harmless parasites, with positive responses.

=== Microbes ===
It is hypothesized that maintenance of commensal microorganism growth in the GI tract is dysregulated, either as a result or cause of immune dysregulation.

There is an apparent connection between Crohn&#x27;s disease, &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;, other pathogenic bacteria, and genetic markers. A number of studies have suggested a causal role for &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; subspecies &quot;paratuberculosis&quot; (MAP), which causes a similar disease, Johne&#x27;s disease, in cattle. In many individuals, genetic factors predispose individuals to &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; subsp.&quot; paratuberculosis&quot; infection. This bacterium may produce certain compounds containing mannose, which may protect both itself and various other bacteria from phagocytosis, thereby possibly causing a variety of secondary infections.

NOD2 is a gene involved in Crohn&#x27;s genetic susceptibility. It is associated with macrophages&#x27; diminished ability to phagocytize MAP. This same gene may reduce innate and adaptive immunity in gastrointestinal tissue and impair the ability to resist infection by the MAP bacterium. Macrophages that ingest the MAP bacterium are associated with high production of TNF-α.

Other studies have linked specific strains of enteroadherent &quot;E. coli&quot; to the disease. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), more common in people with CD, have the ability to make strong biofilms compared to non-AIEC strains correlating with high adhesion and invasion indices of neutrophils and the ability to block autophagy at the autolysosomal step, which allows for intracellular survival of the bacteria and induction of inflammation. Inflammation drives the proliferation of AIEC and dysbiosis in the ileum, irrespective of genotype. AIEC strains replicate extensively inside macrophages inducing the secretion of very large amounts of TNF-α.

Mouse studies have suggested some symptoms of Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome have the same underlying cause. Biopsy samples taken from the colons of all three patient groups were found to produce elevated levels of a serine protease. Experimental introduction of the serine protease into mice has been found to produce widespread pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome, as well as colitis, which is associated with all three diseases. Regional and temporal variations in those illnesses follow those associated with infection with the protozoan &quot;Blastocystis&quot;.

The &quot;cold-chain&quot; hypothesis is that psychrotrophic bacteria such as &quot;Yersinia&quot; and &quot;Listeria&quot; species contribute to the disease. A statistical correlation was found between the advent of the use of refrigeration in the United States and various parts of Europe and the rise of the disease.

There is also a tentative association between &quot;Candida&quot; colonization and Crohn&#x27;s disease.

Still, these relationships between specific pathogens and Crohn&#x27;s disease remain unclear.

=== Environmental factors ===
The increased incidence of Crohn&#x27;s in the industrialized world indicates an environmental component. Crohn&#x27;s is associated with an increased intake of animal protein, milk protein, and an increased ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Those who consume vegetable proteins appear to have a lower incidence of Crohn&#x27;s disease. Consumption of fish protein has no association.
Smoking increases the risk of the return of active disease (flares). The introduction of hormonal contraception in the United States in the 1960s is associated with a dramatic increase in incidence, and one hypothesis is that these drugs work on the digestive system in ways similar to smoking. Isotretinoin is associated with Crohn&#x27;s.

Although stress is sometimes claimed to exacerbate Crohn&#x27;s disease, there is no concrete evidence to support such claim. Still, it is well known that immune function is related to stress. Dietary microparticles, such as those found in toothpaste, have been studied as they produce effects on immunity, but they were not consumed in greater amounts in patients with Crohn&#x27;s. The use of doxycycline has also been associated with increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases. In one large retrospective study, patients who were prescribed doxycycline for their acne had a 2.25-fold greater risk of developing Crohn&#x27;s disease.

== Pathophysiology ==

During a colonoscopy, biopsies of the colon are often taken to confirm the diagnosis. Certain characteristic features of the pathology seen point toward Crohn&#x27;s disease; it shows a transmural pattern of inflammation, meaning the inflammation may span the entire depth of the intestinal wall.

Granulomas, aggregates of macrophage derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn&#x27;s disease. The granulomas of Crohn&#x27;s disease do not show &quot;caseation&quot;, a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination characteristic of granulomas associated with infections, such as tuberculosis. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage, as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal villi, atypical branching of the crypts, and a change in the tissue type (metaplasia). One example of such metaplasia, &quot;Paneth cell metaplasia&quot;, involves the development of Paneth cells (typically found in the small intestine and a key regulator of intestinal microbiota) in other parts of the gastrointestinal system.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of Crohn&#x27;s disease can sometimes be challenging, and many tests are often required to assist the physician in making the diagnosis. Even with a full battery of tests, it may not be possible to diagnose Crohn&#x27;s with complete certainty; a colonoscopy is approximately 70% effective in diagnosing the disease, with further tests being less effective. Disease in the small bowel is particularly difficult to diagnose, as a traditional colonoscopy allows access to only the colon and lower portions of the small intestines; introduction of the capsule endoscopy aids in endoscopic diagnosis. Intestinal ultrasound should be considered an early step in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease even in patients with a proximal small bowel localization of the disease. Giant (multinucleate) cells, a common finding in the lesions of Crohn&#x27;s disease, are less common in the lesions of lichen nitidus.
=== Classification ===

Crohn&#x27;s disease is one type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It typically manifests in the gastrointestinal tract and can be categorized by the specific tract region affected.

Gastroduodenal Crohn&#x27;s disease causes inflammation in the stomach and the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. Jejunoileitis causes spotty patches of inflammation in the top half of the small intestine, called the jejunum. The disease can attack any part of the digestive tract, from mouth to anus. However, individuals affected by the disease rarely fall outside these three classifications, with presentations in other areas.

Crohn&#x27;s disease may also be categorized by the behavior of disease as it progresses. These categorizations formalized in the Vienna classification of the disease. There are three categories of disease presentation in Crohn&#x27;s disease: stricturing, penetrating, and inflammatory. Stricturing disease causes narrowing of the bowel that may lead to bowel obstruction or changes in the caliber of the feces. Penetrating disease creates abnormal passageways (fistulae) between the bowel and other structures, such as the skin. Inflammatory disease (or nonstricturing, nonpenetrating disease) causes inflammation without causing strictures or fistulae.

=== Endoscopy ===
A colonoscopy is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn&#x27;s disease, as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the terminal ileum, identifying the pattern of disease involvement. On occasion, the colonoscope can travel past the terminal ileum, but it varies from person to person. During the procedure, the gastroenterologist can also perform a biopsy, taking small samples of tissue for laboratory analysis, which may help confirm a diagnosis. As 30% of Crohn&#x27;s disease involves only the ileum, cannulation of the terminal ileum is required in making the diagnosis. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum, but not the rectum, is suggestive of Crohn&#x27;s disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata.
The utility of capsule endoscopy for this, however, is still uncertain.

=== Radiologic tests ===
A small bowel follow-through may suggest the diagnosis of Crohn&#x27;s disease and is useful when the disease involves only the small intestine. Because colonoscopy and gastroscopy allow direct visualization of only the terminal ileum and beginning of the duodenum, they cannot be used to evaluate the remainder of the small intestine. As a result, a barium follow-through X-ray, wherein barium sulfate suspension is ingested and fluoroscopic images of the bowel are taken over time, is useful for looking for inflammation and narrowing of the small bowel. Barium enemas, in which barium is inserted into the rectum and fluoroscopy is used to image the bowel, are rarely used in the work-up of Crohn&#x27;s disease due to the advent of colonoscopy. They remain useful for identifying anatomical abnormalities when strictures of the colon are too small for a colonoscope to pass through, or in the detection of colonic fistulae (in this case contrast should be performed with iodate substances).

CT and MRI scans are useful for evaluating the small bowel with enteroclysis protocols. They are also useful for looking for intra-abdominal complications of Crohn&#x27;s disease, such as abscesses, small bowel obstructions, or fistulae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another option for imaging the small bowel as well as looking for complications, though it is more expensive and less readily available. MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging and high-resolution imaging are more sensitive in detecting ulceration and inflammation compared to CT.

=== Blood tests ===
A complete blood count may reveal anemia, which commonly is caused by blood loss leading to iron deficiency or by vitamin B deficiency, usually caused by ileal disease impairing vitamin B absorption. Rarely autoimmune hemolysis may occur. Ferritin levels help assess if iron deficiency is contributing to the anemia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein help assess the degree of inflammation, which is important as ferritin can also be raised in inflammation.

Other causes of anemia include medication used in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, like azathioprine, which can lead to cytopenia, and sulfasalazine, which can also result in folate deficiency. Testing for &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; antibodies (ASCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) has been evaluated to identify inflammatory diseases of the intestine and to differentiate Crohn&#x27;s disease from ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, increasing amounts and levels of serological antibodies such as ASCA, antilaminaribioside [Glc(β1,3)Glb(β); ALCA], antichitobioside [GlcNAc(β1,4)GlcNAc(β); ACCA], antimannobioside [Man(α1,3)Man(α)AMCA], antiLaminarin [(Glc(β1,3))3n(Glc(β1,6))n; anti-L] and antichitin [GlcNAc(β1,4)n; anti-C] associate with disease behavior and surgery, and may aid in the prognosis of Crohn&#x27;s disease.

Low serum levels of vitamin D are associated with Crohn&#x27;s disease. Further studies are required to determine the significance of this association.

=== Comparison with ulcerative colitis ===
The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn&#x27;s disease is ulcerative colitis, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis.
=== Differential diagnosis ===
Other conditions with similar symptoms as Crohn&#x27;s disease includes intestinal tuberculosis, Behçet&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy, irritable bowel syndrome and celiac disease. Irritable bowel syndrome is excluded when there are inflammatory changes. Celiac disease cannot be excluded if specific antibodies (anti-transglutaminase antibodies) are negative, nor in absence of intestinal villi atrophy.

== Management ==
There is no cure for Crohn&#x27;s disease and remission may not be possible or prolonged if achieved. In cases where remission is possible, relapse can be prevented and symptoms controlled with medication, lifestyle and dietary changes, changes to eating habits (eating smaller amounts more often), reduction of stress, moderate activity, and exercise. Surgery is generally contraindicated and has not been shown to prevent relapse. Adequately controlled, Crohn&#x27;s disease may not significantly restrict daily living. Treatment for Crohn&#x27;s disease involves first treating the acute problem and its symptoms, then maintaining remission of the disease.

=== Lifestyle changes ===
Certain lifestyle changes can reduce symptoms, including dietary adjustments, elemental diet, proper hydration, and smoking cessation. Recent reviews underlined the importance to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence, even if little is known about the impact of diets on these patients.
Diets that include higher levels of fiber and fruit are associated with reduced risk, while diets rich in total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, meat, and omega-6 fatty acids may increase the risk of Crohn&#x27;s. Maintaining a balanced diet with proper portion control can help manage symptoms of the disease. Eating small meals frequently instead of big meals may also help with a low appetite. A food diary may help with identifying foods that trigger symptoms. Despite the recognized importance of dietary fiber for intestinal health, some people should follow a low residue diet to control acute symptoms especially if foods high in insoluble fiber cause symptoms, e.g., due to obstruction or irritation of the bowel. Some find relief in eliminating casein (a protein found in cow&#x27;s milk) and gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye and barley) from their diets. They may have specific dietary intolerances (not allergies), for example, lactose. Fatigue can be helped with regular exercise, a healthy diet, and enough sleep, and for those with malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to disease or surgical resection of the terminal ileum, cobalamin injections. Smoking may worsen symptoms and the course of the disease, and stopping is recommended. Alcohol consumption can also worsen symptoms, and moderation or cessation is advised.

=== Medication ===
Acute treatment uses medications to treat any infection (normally antibiotics) and to reduce inflammation (normally aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids). When symptoms are in remission, treatment enters maintenance, with a goal of avoiding the recurrence of symptoms. Prolonged use of corticosteroids has significant side-effects; as a result, they are, in general, not used for long-term treatment. Alternatives include aminosalicylates alone, though only a minority are able to maintain the treatment, and many require immunosuppressive drugs. It has been also suggested that antibiotics change the enteric flora, and their continuous use may pose the risk of overgrowth with pathogens such as &quot;Clostridium difficile&quot;.

Medications used to treat the symptoms of Crohn&#x27;s disease include 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) formulations, prednisone, immunomodulators such as azathioprine (given as the prodrug for 6-mercaptopurine), methotrexate, and anti-TNF therapies and monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, natalizumab,risankizumab-rzaa, and upadacitinib Hydrocortisone should be used in severe attacks of Crohn&#x27;s disease. Biological therapies are medications used to avoid long-term steroid use, decrease inflammation, and treat people who have fistulas with abscesses. The monoclonal antibody ustekinumab appears to be a safe treatment option, and may help people with moderate to severe active Crohn&#x27;s disease. The long term safety and effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatment is not known. The monoclonal antibody briakinumab is not effective for people with active Crohn&#x27;s disease and it is no longer being manufactured.

The gradual loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for this.

=== Immunosuppressant therapies, infection risks and vaccinations ===

Many patients affected by Crohn&#x27;s disease need immunosuppressant therapies, which are known to be associated with a higher risk of contracting opportunistic infectious diseases and of pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions such as cervical high-grade dysplasia and cancer.
Many of these potentially harmful diseases, such as Hepatitis B, Influenza, herpes zoster virus, pneumococcal pneumonia, or human papilloma virus, can be prevented by vaccines. Each drug used in the treatment of IBD should be classified according to the degree of immunosuppression induced in the patient. Several guidelines suggest investigating patients’ vaccination status before starting any treatment and performing vaccinations against Vaccine-preventable disease when required.
Compared to the rest of the population, patients affected by IBD are known to be at higher risk of contracting some vaccine-preventable diseases such as flu and pneumonia.
Nevertheless, despite the increased risk of infections, vaccination rates in IBD patients are known to be suboptimal and may also be lower than vaccination rates in the general population.

=== Surgery ===
Crohn&#x27;s cannot be cured by surgery, as the disease eventually recurs, though it is used in the case of partial or full blockage of the intestine. Surgery may also be required for complications such as obstructions, fistulas, or abscesses, or if the disease does not respond to drugs. After the first surgery, Crohn&#x27;s usually comes back at the site where the diseased intestine was removed and the healthy ends were rejoined; it can also come back in other locations. After a resection, scar tissue builds up, which can cause strictures, which form when the intestines become too small to allow excrement to pass through easily, which can lead to a blockage. After the first resection, another resection may be necessary within five years. For patients with an obstruction due to a stricture, two options for treatment are strictureplasty and resection of that portion of bowel. There is no statistical significance between strictureplasty alone versus strictureplasty and resection in cases of duodenal involvement. In these cases, re-operation rates were 31% and 27%, respectively, indicating that strictureplasty is a safe and effective treatment for selected people with duodenal involvement.

Postsurgical recurrence of Crohn&#x27;s disease is relatively common. Crohn&#x27;s lesions are nearly always found at the site of the resected bowel. The join (or anastomosis) after surgery may be inspected, usually during a colonoscopy, and disease activity graded. The &quot;Rutgeerts score&quot; is an endoscopic scoring system for postoperative disease recurrence in Crohn&#x27;s disease. Postsurgical remission per the Rutgeerts score is graded as i0; while mild postsurgical recurrences are graded i1 and i2, and moderate to severe recurrences are graded i3 and i4. Fewer lesions result in a lower grade. Based on the score, treatment plans can be designed to give the patient the best chance of managing the recurrence of the disease.

Short bowel syndrome (SBS, also short gut syndrome or simply short gut) is caused by the surgical removal of part of the small intestine. It usually develops in those patients who have had half or more of their small intestines removed. Diarrhea is the main symptom, but others may include weight loss, cramping, bloating, and heartburn. Short bowel syndrome is treated with changes in diet, intravenous feeding, vitamin and mineral supplements, and treatment with medications. In some cases of SBS, intestinal transplant surgery may be considered; though the number of transplant centres offering this procedure is quite small and it comes with a high risk due to the chance of infection and rejection of the transplanted intestine.

Bile acid diarrhea is another complication following surgery for Crohn&#x27;s disease in which the terminal ileum has been removed. This leads to the development of excessive watery diarrhea. It is usually thought to be due to an inability of the ileum to reabsorb bile acids after resection of the terminal ileum and was the first type of bile acid malabsorption recognized.

=== Microbiome modification ===
The use of oral probiotic supplements to modify the composition and behaviour of the gastrointestinal microbiome has been researched to understand whether it may help to improve remission rate in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease. However, only two controlled trials were available in 2020, with no clear overall evidence of higher remission nor lower adverse effects, in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease receiving probiotic supplementation.

=== Mental health ===
Crohn&#x27;s may result in anxiety or mood disorders, especially in young people who may have stunted growth or embarrassment from fecal incontinence. Counselling as well as antidepressant or anxiolytic medication may help some people manage.

 there is a small amount of research looking at mindfulness-based therapies, hypnotherapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy. A meta analysis of interventions to improve mood (including talking therapy, antidepressants, and exercise) in people with inflammatory bowel disease found that they reduced inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin. Psychological therapies reduced inflammation more than antidepressants or exercise.

=== Alternative medicine ===
It is common for people with Crohn&#x27;s disease to try complementary or alternative therapy. These include diets, probiotics, fish oil, and other herbal and nutritional supplements.
* Acupuncture is used to treat inflammatory bowel disease in China, and is being used more frequently in Western society. At this time, evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of acupuncture.
* A 2006 survey in Germany found that about half of people with IBD used some form of alternative medicine, with the most common being homeopathy, and a study in France found that about 30% used alternative medicine. Homeopathic preparations are not proven with this or any other condition, with large-scale studies finding them to be no more effective than a placebo.
* There are contradicting studies regarding the effect of medical cannabis on inflammatory bowel disease, and its effects on management are uncertain.

== Prognosis ==
Crohn&#x27;s disease is a chronic condition for which there is no known cure. It is characterised by periods of improvement followed by episodes when symptoms flare up. With treatment, most people achieve a healthy weight, and the mortality rate for the disease is relatively low. It can vary from being benign to very severe, and people with CD could experience just one episode or have continuous symptoms. It usually reoccurs, although some people can remain disease-free for years or decades. Up to 80% of people with Crohn&#x27;s disease are hospitalized at some point during the course of their disease, with the highest rate occurring in the first year after diagnosis. Most people with Crohn&#x27;s live a normal lifespan. However, Crohn&#x27;s disease is associated with a small increase in risk of small bowel and colorectal carcinoma (bowel cancer).

== Epidemiology ==
The percentage of people with Crohn&#x27;s disease has been determined in Norway and the United States and is similar at 6 to 7.1:100,000. The Crohn&#x27;s &amp; Colitis Foundation of America cites this number as approx 149:100,000; NIH cites 28 to 199 per 100,000. Crohn&#x27;s disease is more common in northern countries, and with higher rates still in the northern areas of these countries. The incidence of Crohn&#x27;s disease is thought to be similar in Europe but lower in Asia and Africa. It also has a higher incidence in Ashkenazi Jews and smokers.

Crohn&#x27;s disease begins most commonly in people in their teens and 20s, and people in their 50s through to their 70s. It is rarely diagnosed in early childhood. It usually affects female children more severely than males. However, only slightly more women than men have Crohn&#x27;s disease. Parents, siblings or children of people with Crohn&#x27;s disease are 3 to 20 times more likely to develop the disease. Twin studies find that if one has the disease there is a 55% chance the other will too.

The incidence of Crohn&#x27;s disease is increasing in Europe and in newly industrialised countries. For example, in Brazil, there has been an annual increase of 11% in the incidence of Crohn&#x27;s disease since 1990.

== History ==

Inflammatory bowel diseases were described by Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) and by Scottish physician Thomas Kennedy Dalziel in 1913.

&quot;Ileitis terminalis&quot; was first described by Polish surgeon Antoni Leśniowski in 1904, although it was not conclusively distinguished from intestinal tuberculosis. In Poland, it is still called Leśniowski-Crohn&#x27;s disease (). Burrill Bernard Crohn, an American gastroenterologist at New York City&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital, described fourteen cases in 1932, and submitted them to the American Medical Association under the rubric of &quot;Terminal ileitis: A new clinical entity&quot;. Later that year, he, along with colleagues Leon Ginzburg and Gordon Oppenheimer, published the case series &quot;Regional ileitis: a pathologic and clinical entity&quot;. However, due to the precedence of Crohn&#x27;s name in the alphabet, it later became known in the worldwide literature as Crohn&#x27;s disease.

<text>Mary Elizabeth &quot;Sissy&quot; Spacek (; born December 25, 1949) is an American actress. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and nominations for four BAFTA Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Grammy Award. Spacek was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011.

After attending Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute she had her breakout role in Terrence Malick&#x27;s crime film &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973), which earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer. Spacek went on to earn the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of country singer Loretta Lynn in the biographical musical &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980). Her other Oscar-nominated roles were in &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976), &quot;Missing&quot; (1982), &quot;The River&quot; (1984), &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; (1986), and &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; (2001). Her other prominent films include &quot;3 Women&quot; (1977), &quot;Raggedy Man&quot; (1981), &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot; (1986), &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), &quot;Affliction&quot; (1997), &quot;The Straight Story&quot; (1999), &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; (2002), &quot;Nine Lives&quot; (2005), &quot;North Country&quot; (2005), &quot;Four Christmases&quot; (2008), &quot;Get Low&quot; (2010), &quot;The Help&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Old Man &amp; the Gun&quot; (2018). 

Spacek is also known for her television roles, receiving Primetime Emmy Award nominations for &quot;The Good Old Boys&quot; (1995), &quot;Last Call&quot; (2002), and &quot;Big Love&quot; (2011). She portrayed matriarch Sally Rayburn on the Netflix drama thriller series &quot;Bloodline&quot; (2015–2017), Ruth Deaver on the Hulu series &quot;Castle Rock&quot; (2018), and Ellen Bergman on the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Homecoming&quot; (2018).

Spacek has also ventured into music, and recorded vocals for the soundtrack album of &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums Chart and garnered her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. She also released a studio album, &quot;Hangin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot; (1983), which peaked at number 17 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart.

== Early life and education ==

Mary Elizabeth Spacek was born on Christmas Day 1949, in Quitman, Texas, the daughter of Virginia Frances (née Spilman, 1917–1981) and Edwin Arnold Spacek Sr., a Wood County, Texas agricultural agent in Quitman. Her father was of three quarters Czech (Moravian) and one quarter Sudeten-German ancestry; her paternal grandparents were Mary (née Cervenka) and Arnold A. Spacek (who served as mayor of Granger, Texas in Williamson County). Actor Rip Torn was her first cousin; his mother Thelma Torn (née Spacek) was an elder sister of Sissy&#x27;s father Edwin. Spacek&#x27;s mother, who was of English and Irish descent, was from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.

At the age of six, Spacek performed on stage for the first time in a local talent show. Although her birth name was Mary Elizabeth, she was always called Sissy by her brothers, which led to her nickname. She attended Quitman High School.

Spacek was greatly affected by the 1967 death of her 18-year-old brother Robbie from leukemia, which she has called &quot;the defining event of my whole life.&quot; She has said the tragedy made her fearless in her acting career: 

Spacek initially aspired to a singing career. Under the name Rainbo, she recorded a 1968 single, &quot;John You Went Too Far This Time&quot;, the lyrics of which chided John Lennon for his and Yoko Ono&#x27;s nude album cover for &quot;Two Virgins&quot;. When sales of her music sputtered, she was dropped by her record label. Spacek switched her focus to acting, enrolling at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.

==Career==

===1970–1975: Early roles and breakthrough===
She worked as a photographic model (represented by Ford Models) and as an extra at Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory. With the help of her cousin, actor Rip Torn, she enrolled in Lee Strasberg&#x27;s Actors Studio and later the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York.

Spacek&#x27;s first credited role was in &quot;Prime Cut&quot; (1972), in which she played Poppy, a girl sold into sexual slavery. The role led to television work, including a 1973 guest role on &quot;The Waltons&quot;, which she played twice. She received international attention for her breakthrough role in Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973); she played Holly, the film&#x27;s narrator and 15-year-old girlfriend of serial killer Kit (Martin Sheen). Spacek has described &quot;Badlands&quot; as the &quot;most incredible&quot; experience of her career. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;cool, sometimes brilliant, always ferociously American film&quot; and wrote, &quot;Sheen and Miss Spacek are splendid as the self-absorbed, cruel, possibly psychotic children of our time.&quot; On the set of &quot;Badlands&quot;, Spacek met art director Jack Fisk, whom she married in 1974. She worked as the set dresser for Brian De Palma&#x27;s film &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; (1974).

=== 1976–1980: &quot;Carrie&quot; and film stardom ===

Spacek&#x27;s most prominent early role came in De Palma&#x27;s film &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976) playing Carrie White, a shy, troubled high school senior with telekinetic powers. Spacek had to work hard to persuade de Palma to cast her in the role. After rubbing Vaseline in her hair and donning an old sailor dress her mother had made for her as a child, she turned up at the audition with the odds against her, but won the part. Spacek&#x27;s performance was widely praised and led to a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actress. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: &quot;Though few actresses have distinguished themselves in gothics, Sissy Spacek, who is onscreen almost continuously, gives a classic chameleon performance. She shifts back and forth and sideways: a nasal, whining child; a chaste young beauty at the prom; and then a second transformation when her destructive impulses burst out and age her. Sissy Spacek uses her freckled pallor and whitish eyelashes to suggest a squashed, groggy girl who could go in any direction; at times, she seems unborn–a fetus. I don&#x27;t see how this performance could be any better; she&#x27;s touching, like Elizabeth Hartman in one of her victim roles, but she&#x27;s also unearthly—a changeling.&quot;

After &quot;Carrie&quot;, Spacek played the small role of housekeeper Linda Murray in Alan Rudolph&#x27;s ensemble piece &quot;Welcome to LA&quot; (1976) and cemented her reputation in independent cinema with her performance as Pinky Rose in Robert Altman&#x27;s classic &quot;3 Women&quot; (1977). A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;In this film Miss Spacek adds a new dimension of eeriness to the waif she played so effectively in &quot;Carrie&quot;.&quot; Altman was deeply impressed by her performance: &quot;She&#x27;s remarkable, one of the top actresses I&#x27;ve ever worked with. Her resources are like a deep well.&quot; De Palma said: &quot;[Spacek is] a phantom. She has this mysterious way of slipping into a part, letting it take over her. She&#x27;s got a wider range than any young actress I know.&quot; Spacek helped finance &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977), David Lynch&#x27;s directorial debut, and is thanked in the film&#x27;s credits.

Spacek began the 1980s with an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980), in which she played country music star Loretta Lynn, who selected her for the role. In addition to the Academy Award, she also won the NYFCC Award, LAFCA Award, NSFC Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Both she and Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, who played Patsy Cline, sang their characters&#x27; vocals themselves in the film. Film critic Roger Ebert credited the movie&#x27;s success to &quot;the performance by Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn. With the same sort of magical chemistry she&#x27;s shown before, when she played the high school kid in &quot;Carrie,&quot; Spacek at 29 has the ability to appear to be almost any age on screen. Here, she ages from about 14 to somewhere in her 30s, always looks the age, and never seems to be wearing makeup.&quot; Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote: &quot;Sissy Spacek—yes, I&#x27;m flabbergasted—is simple and faithful as Lynn. Spacek&#x27;s face is no more of an actor&#x27;s instrument than it ever was, but given a human being to play, given a director concerned with acting, she makes that woman exist. She sings the songs herself, nicely, and she has mastered the Appalachian accent.&quot; Spacek also was nominated for a Grammy Award for singing on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. She followed the recording with her own country album, &quot;Hangin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot; (1983); the album spawned one hit single, &quot;Lonely But Only For You,&quot; a song written by K. T. Oslin, which reached No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country chart.

In the film &quot;Heart Beat&quot; (1980), Spacek played Carolyn Cassady, who—under the influence of John Heard&#x27;s Jack Kerouac and Nick Nolte&#x27;s Neal Cassady—slips into a combination of drudgery and debauchery. Spacek was so adamant about getting the role that she pored through over 4,000 pages of research to prepare for her character. Producer Ed Pressman and director John Byrum took her to dinner to advise her that she did not have the role. Spacek was so distraught at the news that she shattered a glass of wine in her hand. After that, Pressman walked up to her with a piece of shattered glass and told her she had the role. He said that Spacek breaking the glass clinched the deal, and they believed she ultimately would best suit the part. The film was released on April 25, 1980, to mixed reviews. Ebert called her performance &quot;wonderfully played&quot; and her scenes with Heard and Nolte &quot;almost poetic.&quot;

=== 1981–2001: Established actress ===

Spacek starred with Jack Lemmon in Costa-Gavras&#x27;s 1982 political thriller &quot;Missing&quot; (based on the book &quot;The Execution of Charles Horman&quot;). She appeared with Mel Gibson in the rural drama &quot;The River&quot; (1984) and she starred alongside Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange in the grimly humorous comedy film &quot;Crimes Of The Heart&quot; (1986). She was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for all these roles, but won her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for the latter. Other performances of the decade included star turns in husband Jack Fisk&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Raggedy Man&quot; (1981) and the drama &quot;&#x27;Night, Mother&quot; (1986) with Anne Bancroft. Spacek showed a lighter side by voicing the brain in the Steve Martin comedy &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; (1983).

Spacek had a supporting role as the wife of Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot; (1991) and made a number of comedies, TV movies, and the occasional film. She played Verena Talbo in the ensemble piece &quot;The Grass Harp&quot; (1995), which reunited her with both Lemmon and Piper Laurie. She lent a supporting performance as the waitress Margie Fogg in Paul Schrader&#x27;s father-son psychodrama &quot;Affliction&quot; (1997). She also played Rose Straight in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;The Straight Story&quot; (1999) and the mother of Brendan Fraser&#x27;s character in &quot;Blast from the Past&quot;.

Spacek began the 2000s with critical acclaim for her performance as Ruth Fowler, a grieving mother consumed by revenge, in Todd Field&#x27;s &quot;In the Bedroom&quot;, which was released in 2001. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Stephen Holden said of her work in the film: &quot;Ms. Spacek&#x27;s performance is as devastating as it is unflashy. With the slight tightening of her neck muscles and a downward twitch of her mouth, she conveys her character&#x27;s relentlessness, then balances it with enough sweetness to make Ruth seem entirely human. It is one of Ms. Spacek&#x27;s greatest performances.&quot; She earned a sixth nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, which established her as the eighth and most recent actress to be nominated for at least six leading role Oscars. She additionally won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress as well as the Critics&#x27; Choice Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama, and Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golden Globes 2002 / A night for the Aussies / &#x27;Beautiful Mind,&#x27; &#x27;Moulin Rouge,&#x27; cable TV take top Golden Globes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002–present: Professional expansion ===
In 2002 she acted the live-action Walt Disney film &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot;. That same year she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her role as Zelda Fitzgerald in the Showtime television film &quot;Last Call&quot; (2002). She acted alongside Jeremy Irons and Neve Campbell. Spacek played unfaithful wife Ruth in Rodrigo García&#x27;s &quot;Nine Lives&quot; (2005) and a woman suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s in the television movie &quot;Pictures of Hollis Woods&quot; (2007). She had a supporting part in the 2008 Christmas comedy &quot;Four Christmases&quot; and a lead role in the independent drama &quot;Lake City&quot;. Spacek appeared in the HBO drama series &quot;Big Love&quot; for a multi-episode arc as a powerful Washington, D.C., lobbyist and earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Spacek narrated the 2005 audiobook of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Carrie&quot;. In 2006, she narrated Harper Lee&#x27;s novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1960), which sold over 30 million copies. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011. Spacek acted in Tate Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The Help&quot; (2011), whose cast received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture.

Spacek published a memoir, &quot;My Extraordinary Ordinary Life&quot;, with co-author Maryanne Vollers, in 2012. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Jen Chaney called it &quot;refreshingly down-to-earth&quot; and &quot;beautifully written,&quot; adding that Spacek&#x27;s description of her childhood is so &quot;evocative that one can almost taste the sour stalks of goatweed she chewed on steamy summer afternoons.&quot; Jay Stafford of &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; wrote that, unlike other actors&#x27; autobiographies, Spacek&#x27;s &quot;benefits from good writing and remarkable frankness.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; Margaret Moser wrote that Spacek&#x27;s memoir is &quot;as easy to read as it is a pleasure to digest.&quot; &quot;Biographile&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; was less appreciative, calling it &quot;an average memoir&quot; and &quot;overly detailed&quot; while criticizing its lack of &quot;narrative arc,&quot; but complimented Spacek for being &quot;truly down-to-earth.&quot; &quot;Kirkus&quot; added that &quot;the book is &#x27;ordinary&#x27; and does not have enough drama to engage readers not directly interested in Spacek and her work&quot; and is &quot;for diehard movie buffs and Spacek fans only.&quot;

Spacek became the first actor to appear in a film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in each of the four most recent decades. Each film was released near the beginning of its decade: &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980), &quot;Missing&quot; (1982), &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Help&quot; (2011). Spacek appeared in the crime drama film &quot;Deadfall&quot; (2012). She also co-starred with Robert Redford in his next-to-last role before his retirement in the biographical crime film &quot;The Old Man &amp; the Gun&quot; (2018), which received critical acclaim. Spacek also had starring roles in a variety of television series in the late 2010s. She starred as the matriarch Sally Rayburn in the Netflix thriller series &quot;Bloodline&quot;, which aired from 2015 to 2017; as Ruth Deaver on the Hulu psychological series &quot;Castle Rock&quot; (2018), which intertwines characters and themes from Stephen King&#x27;s fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine; and as Ellen Bergman, the mother of Julia Roberts&#x27;s character, in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Homecoming&quot; (2018). She co-starred alongside Dustin Hoffman in Darren Le Gallo’s directorial debut &quot;Sam &amp; Kate&quot; (2022). That same year she acted in the Amazon Prime Video science-fiction series &quot;Night Sky&quot; acting opposite J.K. Simmons. The series was cancelled after its first season.

==Personal life==
Spacek married production designer and art director Jack Fisk in 1974, after they met on the set of &quot;Badlands&quot;. They have two daughters: Schuyler Fisk, who was born on July 8, 1982, and Madison Fisk, who was born on September 21, 1988. Schuyler has followed in her mother&#x27;s footsteps as both an actress and a singer. Spacek and her family moved to a farm near Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1982.

<text>A tiltrotor is an aircraft that generates lift and propulsion by way of one or more powered rotors (sometimes called &quot;proprotors&quot;) mounted on rotating shafts or nacelles usually at the ends of a fixed wing. Almost all tiltrotors use a transverse rotor design, with a few exceptions that use other multirotor layouts.

Tiltrotor design combines the VTOL capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. For vertical flight, the rotors are angled so the plane of rotation is horizontal, generating lift the way a normal helicopter rotor does. As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors are progressively tilted forward, with the plane of rotation eventually becoming vertical. In this mode the rotors provide thrust as a propeller, and the airfoil of the fixed wings takes over providing the lift via the forward motion of the entire aircraft. Since the rotors can be configured to be more efficient for propulsion (e.g. with root-tip twist) and it avoids a helicopter&#x27;s issues of retreating blade stall, the tiltrotor can achieve higher cruise speeds and takeoff weights than helicopters.

A tiltrotor aircraft differs from a tiltwing in that only the rotor pivots rather than the entire wing. This method trades off efficiency in vertical flight for efficiency in STOL/STOVL operations.

==History==

The first work in the direction of a tilt-rotor (French &quot;Convertible&quot;) seems to have originated ca. 1902 by the French-Swiss brothers Henri and Armand Dufaux, for which they got a patent in February 1904, and made their work public in April 1905.

Concrete ideas of constructing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft using helicopter-like rotors were pushed further in the 1930s. The first design resembling modern tiltrotors was patented by George Lehberger in May 1930, but he did not further develop the concept. In World War II, Weserflug in Germany came up with the concept of their P.1003/1 around 1938, which was tilting to the top with part of the wings but not the full wings, so it may be in between tilt-rotor and tilt-planes. Shortly after a German prototype, the Focke-Achgelis Fa 269, was developed starting in 1942, which was tilting to the ground, but never flew. Platt and LePage patented the PL-16, the first American tiltrotor aircraft. However, the company shut down in August 1946 due to lack of capital.

Two prototypes which made it to flight were the one-seat Transcendental Model 1-G and two seat Transcendental Model 2, each powered by a single reciprocating engine. Development started on the Model 1-G in 1947, though it did not fly until 1954. The Model 1-G flew for about a year until a crash in Chesapeake Bay on July 20, 1955, destroying the prototype aircraft but not seriously injuring the pilot. The Model 2 was developed and flew shortly afterwards, but the US Air Force withdrew funding in favor of the Bell XV-3 and it did not fly much beyond hover tests. The Transcendental 1-G is the first tiltrotor aircraft to have flown and accomplished most of a helicopter to aircraft transition in flight (to within 10 degrees of true horizontal aircraft flight).

Built in 1953, the experimental Bell XV-3 flew until 1966, proving the fundamental soundness of the tiltrotor concept and gathering data about technical improvements needed for future designs.
A related technology development is the tiltwing. Although two designs, the Canadair CL-84 Dynavert and the LTV XC-142, were technical successes, neither entered production due to other issues. Tiltrotors generally have better hover efficiency than tiltwings, but less than helicopters.

In 1968, Westland Aircraft displayed their own designs—a small experimental craft (We 01C) and a 68-seater transport We 028—at the SBAC Farnborough Airshow.

In 1972, with funding from NASA and the U.S. Army, Bell Helicopter Textron started development of the XV-15, a twin-engine tiltrotor research aircraft. Two aircraft were built to prove the tiltrotor design and explore the operational flight envelope for military and civil applications.

In 1981, using experience gained from the XV-3 and XV-15, Bell and Boeing Helicopters began developing the V-22 Osprey, a twin-turboshaft military tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps.

Bell teamed with Boeing in developing a commercial tiltrotor, but Boeing went out in 1998 and Agusta came in for the Bell/Agusta BA609. This aircraft was redesignated as the AW609 following the transfer of full ownership to AgustaWestland in 2011. Bell has also developed a tiltrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the TR918 Eagle Eye.

Russia has had a few tiltrotor projects, mostly unmanned such as the Mil Mi-30, and has started another in 2015.

Around 2005–2010, Bell and Boeing teamed up again to perform a conceptual study of a larger Quad TiltRotor (QTR) for the US Army&#x27;s Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) program. The QTR is a larger, four rotor version of the V-22 with two tandem wings sets of fixed wings and four tilting rotors.

In January 2013, the FAA defined US tiltrotor noise rules to comply with ICAO rules. A noise certification will cost $588,000, same as for a large helicopter.

AgustaWestland says they have free-flown a manned electric tiltrotor in 2013 called Project Zero, with its rotors inside the wingspan.

In 2013, Bell Helicopter CEO John Garrison responded to Boeing&#x27;s taking a different airframe partner for the US Army&#x27;s future lift requirements by indicating that Bell would take the lead itself in developing the Bell V-280 Valor, with Lockheed Martin.

In 2014, the Clean Sky 2 program (by the European Union and industry) awarded AgustaWestland and its partners $328 million to develop a &quot;next-generation civil tiltrotor&quot; design for the offshore market, with Critical Design Review near the end of 2016. The goals are tilting wing sections, 11 metric tons Maximum takeoff weight, seating for 19 to 22 passengers, first flight in 2021, a cruise speed of 300 knots, a top speed of 330 knots, a ceiling of 25,000 feet, and a range of 500 nautical miles.

==Technical considerations==

===Controls===
In vertical flight, the tiltrotor uses controls very similar to a twin or tandem-rotor helicopter. Yaw is controlled by tilting its rotors in opposite directions. Roll is provided through differential power or thrust. Pitch is provided through rotor blades cyclic-, or nacelle, tilt. Vertical motion is controlled with conventional rotor blade pitch and either a conventional helicopter collective control lever (as in the Bell/Agusta BA609) or a unique control similar to a fixed-wing engine control called a thrust control lever (TCL) (as in the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey).

===Speed and payload issues===
The tiltrotor&#x27;s advantage is significantly greater speed than a helicopter. In a helicopter the maximum forward speed is defined by the turn speed of the rotor; at some point the helicopter will be moving forward at the same speed as the spinning of the backwards-moving side of the rotor, so that side of the rotor sees zero or negative airspeed, and begins to stall. This limits modern helicopters to cruise speeds of about 150 knots / 277 km/h. However, with the tiltrotor this problem is avoided, because the proprotors are perpendicular to the motion in the high-speed portions of the flight regime (and thus not subject to this reverse flow condition), so the tiltrotor has relatively high maximum speed—over 300 knots / 560 km/h has been demonstrated in the two types of tiltrotors flown so far, and cruise speeds of 250 knots / 460 km/h are achieved.

This speed is achieved somewhat at the expense of payload. As a result of this reduced payload, some estimate that a tiltrotor does not exceed the transport efficiency (speed times payload) of a helicopter, while others conclude the opposite. Additionally, the tiltrotor propulsion system is more complex than a conventional helicopter due to the large, articulated nacelles and the added wing; however, the improved cruise efficiency and speed improvement over helicopters is significant in certain uses. Speed and, more importantly, the benefit to overall response time is the principal virtue sought by the military forces that are using the tiltrotor. Tiltrotors are inherently less noisy in forward flight (airplane mode) than helicopters. This, combined with their increased speed, is expected to improve their utility in populated areas for commercial uses and reduce the threat of detection for military uses. Tiltrotors, however, are typically as loud as equally sized helicopters in hovering flight. Noise simulations for a 90-passenger tiltrotor indicate lower cruise noise inside the cabin than a Bombardier Dash 8 airplane, although low-frequency vibrations may be higher.

Tiltrotors also provide substantially greater cruise altitude capability than helicopters. Tiltrotors can easily reach 6,000 m / 20,000 ft or more whereas helicopters typically do not exceed 3,000 m / 10,000 ft altitude. This feature will mean that some uses that have been commonly considered only for fixed-wing aircraft can now be supported with tiltrotors without need of a runway. A drawback however is that a tiltrotor suffers considerably reduced payload when taking off from high altitude.

==Mono tiltrotor==

A mono tiltrotor aircraft uses a tiltable rotating propeller, or &quot;coaxial proprotor&quot;, for lift and propulsion. For vertical flight the proprotor is angled to direct its thrust downwards, providing lift. In this mode of operation the craft is essentially identical to a helicopter. As the craft gains speed, the coaxial proprotor is slowly tilted forward, with the blades eventually becoming perpendicular to the ground. In this mode the wing provides the lift, and the wing&#x27;s greater efficiency helps the tiltrotor achieve its high speed. In this mode, the craft is essentially a turboprop aircraft.

A mono tiltrotor aircraft is different from a conventional tiltrotor in which the proprotors are mounted to the wing tips, in that the &quot;coaxial proprotor&quot; is mounted to the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage. As a result of this structural efficiency, a mono tiltrotor exceeds the transport efficiency (speed times payload) of both a helicopter and a conventional tiltrotor. One design study concluded that if the mono tiltrotor could be technically realized, it would be half the size, one-third the weight, and nearly twice as fast as a helicopter.

In vertical flight, the mono tiltrotor uses controls very similar to a coaxial helicopter, such as the Kamov Ka-50. Yaw is controlled for instance by increasing the lift on the upper proprotor while decreasing the lift on the lower proprotor. Roll and pitch are provided through rotor cyclic. Vertical motion is controlled with conventional rotor blade blade pitch.

<text>Coeliac disease (British English) or celiac disease (American English) is a long-term autoimmune disorder, primarily affecting the small intestine, where individuals develop intolerance to gluten, present in foods such as wheat, rye, spelt and barley. Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and among children failure to grow normally.

Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years. There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body, or no obvious symptoms. Coeliac disease was first described in childhood; however, it may develop at any age. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus and Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, among others.

Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten, a group of various proteins found in wheat and in other grains such as barley and rye. Moderate quantities of oats, free of contamination with other gluten-containing grains, are usually tolerated. The occurrence of problems may depend on the variety of oat. It occurs more often in people who are genetically predisposed. Upon exposure to gluten, an abnormal immune response may lead to the production of several different autoantibodies that can affect a number of different organs. In the small bowel, this causes an inflammatory reaction and may produce shortening of the villi lining the small intestine (villous atrophy). This affects the absorption of nutrients, frequently leading to anaemia.

Diagnosis is typically made by a combination of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies, helped by specific genetic testing. Making the diagnosis is not always straightforward. About 10% of the time, the autoantibodies in the blood are negative, and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi. People may have severe symptoms and they may be investigated for years before a diagnosis is achieved. As a result of screening, the diagnosis is increasingly being made in people who have no symptoms. Evidence regarding the effects of screening, however, is not sufficient to determine its usefulness. While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins, it is distinct from wheat allergy, which is much more rare.

The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet, which leads to recovery of the intestinal lining (mucous membrane), improves symptoms, and reduces the risk of developing complications in most people. If untreated, it may result in cancers such as intestinal lymphoma, and a slightly increased risk of early death. Rates vary between different regions of the world, from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40, with an average of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people. It is estimated that 80% of cases remain undiagnosed, usually because of minimal or absent gastrointestinal complaints and lack of knowledge of symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men.

==Signs and symptoms==
The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include diarrhea, steatorrhoea, iron-deficiency anemia, and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself. It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all. This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children. Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass. Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.

===Gastrointestinal===
Diarrhoea that is characteristic of coeliac disease is chronic, sometimes pale, of large volume, and abnormally foul in odor. Abdominal pain, cramping, bloating with abdominal distension (thought to be the result of fermentative production of bowel gas), and mouth ulcers may be present. As the bowel becomes more damaged, a degree of lactose intolerance may develop. This is because in addition to damage in the intestines, celiac disease can cause a lactase deficiency, which is the enzyme that is responsible for breaking down lactose. Frequently, the symptoms are ascribed to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), only later to be recognised as coeliac disease. In populations of people with symptoms of IBS, a diagnosis of coeliac disease can be made in about 3.3% of cases, or four times more likely than in general. Screening them for coeliac disease is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the British Society of Gastroenterology and the American College of Gastroenterology, but is of unclear benefit in North America.

Coeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of the small bowel (enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) or other non-Hodgkin lymphomas). This risk is also higher in first-degree relatives such as siblings, parents and children. Whether a gluten-free diet brings this risk back to baseline is not clear. Long-standing and untreated disease may lead to other complications, such as ulcerative jejunitis (ulcer formation of the small bowel) and stricturing (narrowing as a result of scarring with obstruction of the bowel).

===Malabsorption-related===
The changes in the bowel reduce its ability to absorb nutrients, minerals, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

*Malabsorption of carbohydrates and fats may cause weight loss (or failure to thrive or stunted growth in children) and fatigue or lack of energy.
*Anaemia may develop in several ways: iron malabsorption may cause iron deficiency anaemia, and folic acid and vitamin B12 malabsorption may give rise to megaloblastic anaemia.
*Calcium and vitamin D malabsorption (and compensatory secondary hyperparathyroidism) may cause osteopenia (decreased mineral content of the bone) or osteoporosis (bone weakening and risk of fragility fractures).
*Selenium malabsorption in coeliac disease, combined with low selenium content in many gluten-free foods, confers a risk of selenium deficiency.
*Copper and zinc deficiencies have also been associated with coeliac disease.
*A small proportion of people have abnormal coagulation because of vitamin K deficiency and are at a slight risk of abnormal bleeding.

===Miscellaneous===
Coeliac disease has been linked with many conditions. In many cases, it is unclear whether the gluten-induced bowel disease is a causative factor or whether these conditions share a common predisposition.

*IgA deficiency is present in 2.3% of people with coeliac disease, and is itself associated with a tenfold increased risk of coeliac disease. Other features of this condition are an increased risk of infections and autoimmune disease.
*Dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy cutaneous condition that has been linked to a transglutaminase enzyme in the skin, features small-bowel changes identical to those in coeliac disease and may respond to gluten withdrawal even if no gastrointestinal symptoms are present.
*Growth failure and/or pubertal delay in later childhood can occur even without obvious bowel symptoms or severe malnutrition. Evaluation of growth failure often includes coeliac screening.
*Pregnancy complications can occur if coeliac disease is pre-existing or later acquired, with significant outcomes including miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight and preterm birth.
*Hyposplenism (a small and underactive spleen) occurs in about a third of cases and may predispose to infection given the role of the spleen in protecting against harmful bacteria.
*Abnormal liver function tests (randomly detected on blood tests) may be seen.
*Depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders

Coeliac disease is associated with several other medical conditions, many of which are autoimmune disorders: diabetes mellitus type 1, hypothyroidism, primary biliary cholangitis, microscopic colitis, gluten ataxia, psoriasis, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and more.

==Causes==
Coeliac disease is caused by an inflammatory reaction to gliadins and glutenins (gluten proteins) found in wheat and to similar proteins found in the crops of the tribe Triticeae (which includes other common grains such as barley and rye) and to the tribe Aveneae (oats). Wheat subspecies (such as spelt, durum, and Kamut) and wheat hybrids (such as triticale) also cause symptoms of coeliac disease.

A small number of people with coeliac disease react to oats. Oat toxicity in coeliac people depends on the oat cultivar consumed because the prolamin genes, protein amino acid sequences, and the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins are different in different oat varieties. Also, oats are frequently cross-contaminated with other grains containing gluten. The term &quot;pure oats&quot; refers to oats uncontaminated with other gluten-containing cereals. The long-term effects of pure oat consumption are still unclear, and further studies identifying the cultivars used are needed before making final recommendations on their inclusion in a gluten-free diet. Coeliac people who choose to consume oats need a more rigorous lifelong follow-up, possibly including periodic intestinal biopsies.

===Other grains===
Other cereals such as corn, millet, sorghum, teff, rice, and wild rice are safe for people with coeliac disease to consume, as well as non-cereals such as amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat. Noncereal carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes and bananas do not contain gluten and do not trigger symptoms.

===Risk modifiers===
There are various theories as to what determines whether a genetically susceptible individual will go on to develop coeliac disease. Major theories include surgery, pregnancy, infection and emotional stress.

The eating of gluten early in a baby&#x27;s life does not appear to increase the risk of coeliac disease but later introduction after six months may increase it. There is uncertainty whether being breastfed reduces risk. Prolonging breastfeeding until the introduction of gluten-containing grains into the diet appears to be associated with a 50% reduced risk of developing coeliac disease in infancy; whether this persists into adulthood is not clear. These factors may just influence the timing of onset.

==Mechanism==
Coeliac disease appears to be multifactorial, both in that more than one genetic factor can cause the disease and in that more than one factor is necessary for the disease to manifest in a person.

Almost all people (95%) with coeliac disease have either the variant HLA-DQ2 allele or (less commonly) the HLA-DQ8 allele. However, about 20–30% of people without coeliac disease have also inherited either of these alleles. This suggests that additional factors are needed for coeliac disease to develop; that is, the predisposing HLA risk allele is necessary but not sufficient to develop coeliac disease. Furthermore, around 5% of those people who do develop coeliac disease do not have typical HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles (see below).

===Genetics===

The vast majority of people with coeliac have one of two types (out of seven) of the HLA-DQ protein. 

There are seven HLA-DQ variants (DQ2 and DQ4–DQ9). Over 95% of people with coeliac have the isoform of DQ2 or DQ8, which is inherited in families. The reason these genes produce an increase in the risk of coeliac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to gliadin peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen-presenting receptor. Therefore, these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate T lymphocytes and initiate the autoimmune process.
Most people with coeliac bear a two-gene HLA-DQ2 haplotype referred to as DQ2.5 haplotype. This haplotype is composed of two adjacent gene alleles, DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201, which encode the two subunits, DQ α5 and DQ β2. In most individuals, this DQ2.5 isoform is encoded by one of two chromosomes 6 inherited from parents (DQ2.5cis). Most coeliacs inherit only one copy of this DQ2.5 haplotype, while some inherit it from &quot;both&quot; parents; the latter are especially at risk for coeliac disease as well as being more susceptible to severe complications.

Some individuals inherit DQ2.5 from one parent and an additional portion of the haplotype (either DQB1*02 or DQA1*05) from the other parent, increasing risk. Less commonly, some individuals inherit the DQA1*05 allele from one parent and the DQB1*02 from the other parent (DQ2.5trans) (called a trans-haplotype association), and these individuals are at similar risk for coeliac disease as those with a single DQ2.5-bearing chromosome 6, but in this instance, the disease tends not to be familial. Among the 6% of European coeliacs that do not have DQ2.5 (cis or trans) or DQ8 (encoded by the haplotype DQA1*03:DQB1*0302), 4% have the DQ2.2 isoform, and the remaining 2% lack DQ2 or DQ8.

The frequency of these genes varies geographically. DQ2.5 has high frequency in peoples of North and Western Europe (Basque Country and Ireland with highest frequencies) and portions of Africa and is associated with disease in India, but it is not found along portions of the West Pacific rim. DQ8 has a wider global distribution than DQ2.5 and is particularly common in South and Central America; up to 90% of individuals in certain Amerindian populations carry DQ8 and thus may display the coeliac phenotype.

Other genetic factors have been repeatedly reported in coeliac disease; however, involvement in disease has variable geographic recognition. Only the HLA-DQ loci show a consistent involvement over the global population. Many of the loci detected have been found in association with other autoimmune diseases. One locus, the LPP or lipoma-preferred partner gene, is involved in the adhesion of extracellular matrix to the cell surface, and a minor variant (SNP=rs1464510) increases the risk of disease by approximately 30%. This gene strongly associates with coeliac disease (p &lt; 10−39) in samples taken from a broad area of Europe and the US.

The prevalence of coeliac disease genotypes in the modern population is not completely understood. Given the characteristics of the disease and its apparent strong heritability, it would normally be expected that the genotypes would undergo negative selection and to be absent in societies where agriculture has been practised the longest (compare with a similar condition, lactose intolerance, which has been negatively selected so strongly that its prevalence went from ~100% in ancestral populations to less than 5% in some European countries). This expectation was first proposed by Simoons (1981). By now, however, it is apparent that this is not the case; on the contrary, there is evidence of &quot;positive&quot; selection in coeliac disease genotypes. It is suspected that some of them may have been beneficial by providing protection against bacterial infections.

===Prolamins===
The majority of the proteins in food responsible for the immune reaction in coeliac disease are the prolamins. These are storage proteins rich in proline (&quot;prol-&quot;) and glutamine (&quot;-amin&quot;) that dissolve in alcohols and are resistant to proteases and peptidases of the gut. Prolamins are found in cereal grains with different grains having different but related prolamins: wheat (gliadin), barley (hordein), rye (secalin) and oats (avenin). One region of α-gliadin stimulates membrane cells, enterocytes, of the intestine to allow larger molecules around the sealant between cells. Disruption of tight junctions allow peptides larger than three amino acids to enter the intestinal lining.
Membrane leaking permits peptides of gliadin that stimulate two levels of the immune response: the innate response, and the adaptive (T-helper cell-mediated) response. One protease-resistant peptide from α-gliadin contains a region that stimulates lymphocytes and results in the release of interleukin-15. This innate response to gliadin results in immune-system signalling that attracts inflammatory cells and increases the release of inflammatory chemicals. The strongest and most common adaptive response to gliadin is directed toward an α2-gliadin fragment of 33 amino acids in length.

The response to the 33mer occurs in most coeliacs who have a DQ2 . This peptide, when altered by intestinal transglutaminase, has a high density of overlapping T-cell epitopes. This increases the likelihood that the DQ2 isoform will bind, and stay bound to, peptide when recognised by T-cells. Gliadin in wheat is the best-understood member of this family, but other prolamins exist, and hordein (from barley), secalin (from rye), and avenin (from oats) may contribute to coeliac disease. Avenin&#x27;s toxicity in people with coeliac disease depends on the oat cultivar consumed, as prolamin genes, protein amino acid sequences, and the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins vary among oat varieties.

===Tissue transglutaminase===

Anti-transglutaminase antibodies to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are found in the blood of the majority of people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy, but only in 70% of the cases with partial villous atrophy and 30% of the cases with minor mucosal lesions. Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten peptides into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively. These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, deamidation or transamidation.

Deamidation is the reaction by which a glutamate residue is formed by cleavage of the epsilon-amino group of a glutamine side chain. Transamidation, which occurs three times more often than deamidation, is the cross-linking of a glutamine residue from the gliadin peptide to a lysine residue of tTg in a reaction that is catalysed by the transglutaminase. Crosslinking may occur either within or outside the active site of the enzyme. The latter case yields a permanently covalently linked complex between the gliadin and the tTg. This results in the formation of new epitopes believed to trigger the primary immune response by which the autoantibodies against tTg develop.

Stored biopsies from people with suspected coeliac disease have revealed that autoantibody deposits in the coeliacs are detected prior to clinical disease. These deposits are also found in people who present with other autoimmune diseases, anaemia, or malabsorption phenomena at a much increased rate over the normal population. Endomysial components of antibodies (EMA) to tTG are believed to be directed toward cell-surface transglutaminase, and these antibodies are still used in confirming a coeliac disease diagnosis. However, a 2006 study showed that EMA-negative people with coeliac tend to be older males with more severe abdominal symptoms and a lower frequency of &quot;atypical&quot; symptoms, including autoimmune disease. In this study, the anti-tTG antibody deposits did not correlate with the severity of villous destruction. These findings, coupled with work showing that gliadin has an innate response component, suggest that gliadin may be more responsible for the primary manifestations of coeliac disease, whereas tTG is a bigger factor in secondary effects such as allergic responses and secondary autoimmune diseases. In a large percentage of people with coeliac, the anti-tTG antibodies also recognise a rotavirus protein called VP7. These antibodies stimulate monocyte proliferation, and rotavirus infection might explain some early steps in the cascade of immune cell proliferation.

Indeed, earlier studies of rotavirus damage in the gut showed this causes villous atrophy. 

Other intestinal disorders may have biopsy that look like coeliac disease including lesions caused by Candida.

===Villous atrophy and malabsorption===
Alternative causes of this tissue damage have been proposed and involve the release of interleukin 15 and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide (p31–43/49). This would trigger killing of enterocytes by lymphocytes in the epithelium. The villous atrophy seen on biopsy may also be due to unrelated causes, such as tropical sprue, giardiasis and radiation enteritis. While positive serology and typical biopsy are highly suggestive of coeliac disease, lack of response to the diet may require these alternative diagnoses to be considered.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay. It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.

Several tests can be used. The level of symptoms may determine the order of the tests, but &quot;all&quot; tests lose their usefulness if the person is already eating a gluten-free diet. Intestinal damage begins to heal within weeks of gluten being removed from the diet, and antibody levels decline over months. For those who have already started on a gluten-free diet, it may be necessary to perform a rechallenge with some gluten-containing food in one meal a day over six weeks before repeating the investigations.

===Blood tests===

Serological blood tests are the first-line investigation required to make a diagnosis of coeliac disease. Its sensitivity correlates with the degree of histological lesions. People who present with minor damage to the small intestine may have seronegative findings so many patients with coeliac disease often are missed. In patients with villous atrophy, anti-endomysial (EMA) antibodies of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) type can detect coeliac disease with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 99%, respectively. Serology for anti-transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) was initially reported to have a higher sensitivity (99%) and specificity (&gt;90%). However, it is now thought to have similar characteristics to anti-endomysial antibodies. Both anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies have high sensitivity to diagnose people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy, but they are only found in 30–89% of the cases with partial villous atrophy and in less than 50% of the people who have minor mucosal lesions (duodenal lymphocytosis) with normal villi.

Tissue transglutaminase (abbreviated as tTG or TG2) modifies gluten peptides into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively. These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, deamidation or transamidation. Modern anti-tTG assays rely on a human recombinant protein as an antigen. tTG testing should be done first as it is an easier test to perform. An equivocal result on tTG testing should be followed by anti-endomysial antibodies.

Guidelines recommend that a total serum IgA level is checked in parallel, as people with coeliac with IgA deficiency may be unable to produce the antibodies on which these tests depend (&quot;false negative&quot;). In those people, IgG antibodies against transglutaminase (IgG-tTG) may be diagnostic.

If all these antibodies are negative, then anti-DGP antibodies (antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides) should be determined. IgG class anti-DGP antibodies may be useful in people with IgA deficiency. In children younger than two years, anti-DGP antibodies perform better than anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies tests.

Because of the major implications of a diagnosis of coeliac disease, professional guidelines recommend that a positive blood test is still followed by an endoscopy/gastroscopy and biopsy. A negative serology test may still be followed by a recommendation for endoscopy and duodenal biopsy if clinical suspicion remains high.

Historically three other antibodies were measured: anti-reticulin (ARA), anti-gliadin (AGA) and anti-endomysial (EMA) antibodies. ARA testing, however, is not accurate enough for routine diagnostic use. Serology may be unreliable in young children, with anti-gliadin performing somewhat better than other tests in children under five. Serology tests are based on indirect immunofluorescence (reticulin, gliadin and endomysium) or ELISA (gliadin or tissue transglutaminase, tTG).

Other antibodies such as anti–&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; antibodies occur in some people with coeliac disease but also occur in other autoimmune disorders and about 5% of those who donate blood.

Antibody testing may be combined with HLA testing if the diagnosis is unclear. TGA and EMA testing are the most sensitive serum antibody tests, but as a negative HLA-DQ type excludes the diagnosis of coeliac disease, testing also for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 maximises sensitivity and negative predictive values. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) does not (as of 2015) recommend the use of HLA typing to rule out coeliac disease outside of a specialist setting, for example, in children who are not having a biopsy, or in patients who already have limited gluten ingestion and opt not to have a gluten challenge.

===Endoscopy===
An upper endoscopy with biopsy of the duodenum (beyond the duodenal bulb) or jejunum is performed to obtain multiple samples (four to eight) from the duodenum. Not all areas may be equally affected; if biopsies are taken from healthy bowel tissue, the result would be a false negative. Even in the same bioptic fragment, different degrees of
damage may be present.

Most people with coeliac disease have a small intestine that appears to be normal on endoscopy before the biopsies are examined. However, five findings have been associated with high specificity for coeliac disease: scalloping of the small bowel folds (&quot;pictured&quot;), paucity in the folds, a mosaic pattern to the mucosa (described as a &quot;cracked-mud&quot; appearance), prominence of the submucosa blood vessels, and a nodular pattern to the mucosa.

European guidelines suggest that in children and adolescents with symptoms compatible with coeliac disease, the diagnosis can be made without the need for intestinal biopsy if anti-tTG antibodies titres are very high (10 times the upper limit of normal).

Until the 1970s, biopsies were obtained using metal capsules attached to a suction device. The capsule was swallowed and allowed to pass into the small intestine. After x-ray verification of its position, suction was applied to collect part of the intestinal wall inside the capsule. Often-utilised capsule systems were the Watson capsule and the Crosby–Kugler capsule. This method has now been largely replaced by fibre-optic endoscopy, which carries a higher sensitivity and a lower frequency of errors.

Capsule endoscopy (CE) allows identification of typical mucosal changes observed in coeliac disease but has a lower sensitivity compared to regular endoscopy and histology. CE is therefore not the primary diagnostic tool for coeliac disease. However, CE can be used for diagnosing T-cell lymphoma, ulcerative jejunoileitis, and adenocarcinoma in refractory or complicated coeliac disease.

===Pathology===
The classic pathology changes of coeliac disease in the small bowel are categorised by the &quot;Marsh classification&quot;:
*Marsh stage 0: normal mucosa
*Marsh stage 1: increased number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs), usually exceeding 20 per 100 enterocytes
*Marsh stage 2: a proliferation of the crypts of Lieberkühn
*Marsh stage 3: partial or complete villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia
*Marsh stage 4: hypoplasia of the small intestine architecture

Marsh&#x27;s classification, introduced in 1992, was subsequently modified in 1999 to six stages, where the previous stage 3 was split in three substages. Further studies demonstrated that this system was not always reliable and that the changes observed in coeliac disease could be described in one of three stages:
*A representing lymphocytic infiltration with normal villous appearance;
*B1 describing partial villous atrophy; and
*B2 describing complete villous atrophy.

The changes classically improve or reverse after gluten is removed from the diet. However, most guidelines do not recommend a repeat biopsy unless there is no improvement in the symptoms on diet. In some cases, a deliberate gluten challenge, followed by a biopsy, may be conducted to confirm or refute the diagnosis. A normal biopsy and normal serology after challenge indicates the diagnosis may have been incorrect.

In untreated coeliac disease, villous atrophy is more common in children younger than three years, but in older children and adults, it is common to find minor intestinal lesions (duodenal lymphocytosis) with normal intestinal villi.

===Other diagnostic tests===
At the time of diagnosis, further investigations may be performed to identify complications, such as iron deficiency (by full blood count and iron studies), folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency and hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels, often due to decreased vitamin D levels). Thyroid function tests may be requested during blood tests to identify hypothyroidism, which is more common in people with coeliac disease.

Osteopenia and osteoporosis, mildly and severely reduced bone mineral density, are often present in people with coeliac disease, and investigations to measure bone density may be performed at diagnosis, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning, to identify the risk of fracture and need for bone protection medication.

===Gluten withdrawal===
Although blood antibody tests, biopsies, and genetic tests usually provide a clear diagnosis, occasionally the response to gluten withdrawal on a gluten-free diet is needed to support the diagnosis. Currently, gluten challenge is no longer required to confirm the diagnosis in patients with intestinal lesions compatible with coeliac disease and a positive response to a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, in some cases, a gluten challenge with a subsequent biopsy may be useful to support the diagnosis, for example in people with a high suspicion for coeliac disease, without a biopsy confirmation, who have negative blood antibodies and are already on a gluten-free diet. Gluten challenge is discouraged before the age of 5 years and during pubertal growth. The alternative diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity may be made where there is only symptomatic evidence of gluten sensitivity. Gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms of people with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity can be similar to those of coeliac disease, and improve when gluten is removed from the diet, after coeliac disease and wheat allergy are reasonably excluded.

Up to 30% of people often continue having or redeveloping symptoms after starting a gluten-free diet. A careful interpretation of the symptomatic response is needed, as a lack of response in a person with coeliac disease may be due to continued ingestion of small amounts of gluten, either voluntary or inadvertent, or be due to other commonly associated conditions such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), lactose intolerance, fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol malabsorption, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and microscopic colitis, among others. In untreated coeliac disease, these are often transient conditions derived from the intestinal damage. They normally revert or improve several months after starting a gluten-free diet, but may need temporary interventions such as supplementation with pancreatic enzymes, dietary restrictions of lactose, fructose, sucrose or sorbitol containing foods, or treatment with oral antibiotics in the case of associated bacterial overgrowth. In addition to gluten withdrawal, some people need to follow a low-FODMAPs diet or avoid consumption of commercial gluten-free products, which are usually rich in preservatives and additives (such as sulfites, glutamates, nitrates and benzoates) and might have a role in triggering functional gastrointestinal symptoms.

==Screening==
There is debate as to the benefits of screening. As of 2017, the United States Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation among those without symptoms. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend testing for coeliac disease in first-degree relatives of those with the disease already confirmed, in people with persistent fatigue, abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms, faltering growth, unexplained weight loss or iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, severe mouth ulcers, and with diagnoses of type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, and with newly diagnosed chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. Dermatitis herpetiformis is included in other recommendations. The NICE also recommend offering serological testing for coeliac disease in people with metabolic bone disease (reduced bone mineral density or osteomalacia), unexplained neurological disorders (such as peripheral neuropathy and ataxia), fertility problems or recurrent miscarriage, persistently raised liver enzymes with unknown cause, dental enamel defects and with diagnose of Down syndrome or Turner syndrome.

Some evidence has found that early detection may decrease the risk of developing health complications, such as osteoporosis, anaemia, and certain types of cancer, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and reproductive problems. They thus recommend screening in people with certain health problems.

Serology has been proposed as a screening measure, because the presence of antibodies would detect some previously undiagnosed cases of coeliac disease and prevent its complications in those people. However, serologic tests have high sensitivity only in people with total villous atrophy and have a very low ability to detect cases with partial villous atrophy or minor intestinal lesions. Testing for coeliac disease may be offered to those with commonly associated conditions.

==Treatment==

===Diet===

At present, the only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. No medication exists that prevents damage or prevents the body from attacking the gut when gluten is present. Strict adherence to the diet helps the intestines heal, leading to resolution of all symptoms in most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun, can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer and in some cases sterility. Compliance to a strict gluten-free diet is difficult for the patient, but evidence has accumulated that a strict gluten-free diet can result in resolution of diarrhea, weight gain and normalization of nutrient malabsorption, with normalization of biopsies in 6 months to 2 years on a gluten-free diet.

Dietitian input is generally requested to ensure the person is aware which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and how to have a balanced diet despite the limitations. In many countries, gluten-free products are available on prescription and may be reimbursed by health insurance plans. Gluten-free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten-containing foods. Since ready-made products often contain traces of gluten, some coeliacs may find it necessary to cook from scratch.

The term &quot;gluten-free&quot; is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence. The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial. A recent systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10 mg of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been done. Regulation of the label &quot;gluten-free&quot; varies. In the European Union, the European Commission issued regulations in 2009 limiting the use of &quot;gluten-free&quot; labels for food products to those with less than 20 mg/kg of gluten, and &quot;very low gluten&quot; labels for those with less than 100 mg/kg. In the United States, the FDA issued regulations in 2013 limiting the use of &quot;gluten-free&quot; labels for food products to those with less than 20 ppm of gluten. The current international Codex Alimentarius standard allows for 20 ppm of gluten in so-called &quot;gluten-free&quot; foods.

Gluten-free diet improves healthcare-related quality of life, and strict adherence to the diet gives more benefit than incomplete adherence. Nevertheless, gluten-free diet does not completely normalise the quality of life.

===Vaccination===

Even though it is unclear if coeliac patients have a generally increased risk of infectious diseases, they should generally be encouraged to receive all common vaccines against vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) as the general population. Moreover, some pathogens could be harmful to coeliac patients. According to the European Society for the Study of Coeliac Disease (ESsCD), coeliac disease can be associated with hyposplenism or functional asplenia, which could result in impaired immunity to encapsulated bacteria, with an increased risk of such infections. For this reason, patients who are known to be hyposplenic should be offered at least the pneumococcal vaccine. However, the ESsCD states that it is not clear whether vaccination with the conjugated vaccine is preferable in this setting and whether additional vaccination against Haemophilus, meningococcus, and influenza should be considered if not previously given. However, Mårild et al. suggested considering additional vaccination against influenza because of an observed increased risk of hospital admission for this infection in celiac patients.

===Refractory disease===
Between 0.3% and 10% of affected people have refractory disease, which means that they have persistent villous atrophy on a gluten-free diet despite the lack of gluten exposure for more than 12 months. Nevertheless, inadvertent exposure to gluten is the main cause of persistent villous atrophy, and must be ruled out before a diagnosis of refractory disease is made. People with poor basic education and understanding of gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors. Also, a lack of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of intestinal recuperation.

If alternative causes of villous atrophy have been eliminated, steroids or immunosuppressants (such as azathioprine) may be considered in this scenario.

Refractory coeliac disease should not be confused with the persistence of symptoms despite gluten withdrawal caused by transient conditions derived from the intestinal damage, which generally revert or improve several months after starting a gluten-free diet, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol malabsorption, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and microscopic colitis among others.

Refractory celiac disease can be divided in type I and II. A recent studied compared patients with type I and II. Refractory celiac disease type I more frequently exhibits diarrhea, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, parenteral nutrition need, ulcerative jejuno-ileitis, and extended small intestinal atrophy. Among patients with refractory celiac disease type II is more common to develop lymphoma. Among these patients, atrophy extension was the only parameter correlated with hypoalbuminemia and mortality.

==Epidemiology==
Globally coeliac disease affects between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people. Rates, however, vary between different regions of the world from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40. In the United States it is thought to affect between 1 in 1750 (defined as clinical disease including dermatitis herpetiformis with limited digestive tract symptoms) to 1 in 105 (defined by presence of IgA TG in blood donors). Due to variable signs and symptoms it is believed that about 85% of people affected are undiagnosed. The percentage of people with clinically diagnosed disease (symptoms prompting diagnostic testing) is 0.05–0.27% in various studies. However, population studies from parts of Europe, India, South America, Australasia and the USA (using serology and biopsy) indicate that the percentage of people with the disease may be between 0.33 and 1.06% in children (but 5.66% in one study of children of the predisposed Sahrawi people) and 0.18–1.2% in adults. Among those in primary care populations who report gastrointestinal symptoms, the rate of coeliac disease is about 3%. In Australia, approximately 1 in 70 people have the disease. The rate amongst adult blood donors in Iran, Israel, Syria and Turkey is 0.60%, 0.64%, 1.61% and 1.15%, respectively.

People of African, Japanese and Chinese descent are rarely diagnosed; this reflects a much lower prevalence of the genetic risk factors, such as HLA-B8. People of Indian ancestry seem to have a similar risk to those of Western Caucasian ancestry. Population studies also indicate that a large proportion of coeliacs remain undiagnosed; this is due, in part, to many clinicians being unfamiliar with the condition and also due to the fact it can be asymptomatic. Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men. A large multicentre study in the U.S. found a prevalence of 0.75% in not-at-risk groups, rising to 1.8% in symptomatic people, 2.6% in second-degree relatives (like grandparents, aunt or uncle, grandchildren, etc.) of a person with coeliac disease and 4.5% in first-degree relatives (siblings, parents or children). This profile is similar to the prevalence in Europe. Other populations at increased risk for coeliac disease, with prevalence rates ranging from 5% to 10%, include individuals with Down and Turner syndromes, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease, including both hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).

Historically, coeliac disease was thought to be rare, with a prevalence of about 0.02%. The reason for the recent increases in the number of reported cases is unclear. It may be at least in part due to changes in diagnostic practice. There also appears to be an approximately 4.5 fold true increase that may be due to less exposure to bacteria and other pathogens in Western environments. In the United States, the median age at diagnosis is 38 years. Roughly 20 percent of individuals with coeliac disease are diagnosed after 60 years of age.

==History==
The term &quot;coeliac&quot; comes from Greek κοιλιακός () &#x27;abdominal&#x27; and was introduced in the 19th century in a translation of what is generally regarded as an Ancient Greek description of the disease by Aretaeus of Cappadocia.

Humans first started to cultivate grains in the Neolithic period (beginning about 9500 BCE) in the Fertile Crescent in Western Asia, and, likely, coeliac disease did not occur before this time. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, living in the second century in the same area, recorded a malabsorptive syndrome with chronic diarrhoea, causing a debilitation of the whole body. His &quot;Cœliac Affection&quot; gained the attention of Western medicine when Francis Adams presented a translation of Aretaeus&#x27;s work at the Sydenham Society in 1856. The patient described in Aretaeus&#x27; work had stomach pain and was atrophied, pale, feeble, and incapable of work. The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white, malodorous, and flatulent, and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return. The problem, Aretaeus believed, was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body, this incomplete digestion resulting in diarrhoea. He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women, explicitly excluding children. The cause, according to Aretaeus, was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming &quot;a copious draught of cold water.&quot;

The paediatrician Samuel Gee gave the first modern-day description of the condition in children in a lecture at Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London, in 1887. Gee acknowledged earlier descriptions and terms for the disease and adopted the same term as Aretaeus (coeliac disease). He perceptively stated: &quot;If the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet.&quot; Gee recognised that milk intolerance is a problem with coeliac children and that highly starched foods should be avoided. However, he forbade rice, sago, fruit, and vegetables, which all would have been safe to eat, and he recommended raw meat as well as thin slices of toasted bread. Gee highlighted particular success with a child &quot;who was fed upon a quart of the best Dutch mussels daily.&quot; However, the child could not bear this diet for more than one season.

Christian Archibald Herter, an American physician, wrote a book in 1908 on children with coeliac disease, which he called &quot;intestinal infantilism&quot;. He noted their growth was retarded and that fat was better tolerated than carbohydrate. The eponym &quot;Gee-Herter disease&quot; was sometimes used to acknowledge both contributions. Sidney V. Haas, an American paediatrician, reported positive effects of a diet of bananas in 1924. This diet remained in vogue until the actual cause of coeliac disease was determined.

While a role for carbohydrates had been suspected, the link with wheat was not made until the 1940s by the Dutch paediatrician Dr Willem Karel Dicke. It is likely that clinical improvement of his patients during the Dutch famine of 1944–1945 (during which flour was scarce) may have contributed to his discovery. Dicke noticed that the shortage of bread led to a significant drop in the death rate among children affected by coeliac disease from greater than 35% to essentially zero. He also reported that once wheat was again available after the conflict, the mortality rate soared to previous levels. The link with the gluten component of wheat was made in 1952 by a team from Birmingham, England. Villous atrophy was described by British physician John W. Paulley in 1954 on samples taken at surgery. This paved the way for biopsy samples taken by endoscopy.

Throughout the 1960s, other features of coeliac disease were elucidated. Its hereditary character was recognised in 1965. In 1966, dermatitis herpetiformis was linked to gluten sensitivity.

==Society and culture==

May has been designated as &quot;Coeliac Awareness Month&quot; by several coeliac organisations.

===Christian churches and the Eucharist===
Speaking generally, the various denominations of Christians celebrate a Eucharist in which a wafer or small piece of sacramental bread from wheat bread is blessed and then eaten. A typical wafer weighs about half a gram. Wheat flour contains around 10–13% gluten, so a single communion wafer may have more than 50 mg of gluten, an amount that harms many people with coeliac, especially if consumed every day (see &quot;Diet&quot; above).

Many Christian churches offer their communicants gluten-free alternatives, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread. These include the United Methodist, Christian Reformed, Episcopal, the Anglican Church (Church of England, UK) and Lutheran. Catholics may receive from the Chalice alone, or ask for gluten-reduced hosts; gluten-free ones however are not considered to still be wheat bread and hence invalid matter.

====Roman Catholic position====
Roman Catholic doctrine states that for a valid Eucharist, the bread to be used at Mass must be made from wheat. Low-gluten hosts meet all of the Catholic Church&#x27;s requirements, but they are not entirely gluten free. Requests to use rice wafers have been denied.

The issue is more complex for priests. As a celebrant, a priest is, for the fullness of the sacrifice of the Mass, absolutely required to receive under both species. On 24 July 2003, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated, &quot;Given the centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest, one must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those candidates unable to ingest gluten or alcohol without serious harm.&quot;

By January 2004, extremely low-gluten Church-approved hosts had become available in the United States, Italy and Australia. As of July 2017, the Vatican still outlawed the use of gluten-free bread for Holy Communion.

===Passover===
 The Jewish festival of Pesach (Passover) may present problems with its obligation to eat Matzah, which is unleavened bread made in a strictly controlled manner from wheat, barley, spelt, oats, or rye.
In addition, many other grains that are normally used as substitutes for people with gluten sensitivity, including rice, are avoided altogether on Passover by Ashkenazi Jews. Many kosher-for-Passover products avoid grains altogether and are therefore gluten-free. Potato starch is the primary starch used to replace the grains.

===Spelling===
Coeliac disease is the preferred spelling in Commonwealth English, while celiac disease is typically used in North American English.

==Research directions==
The search for environmental factors that could be responsible for genetically susceptible people becoming intolerant to gluten has resulted in increasing research activity looking at gastrointestinal infections. Research published in April 2017 suggests that an often-symptomless infection by a common strain of reovirus can increase sensitivity to foods such as gluten.

Various treatment approaches are being studied, including some that would reduce the need for dieting. All are still under development, and are not expected to be available to the general public for a while.

Three main approaches have been proposed as new therapeutic modalities for coeliac disease: gluten detoxification, modulation of the intestinal permeability, and modulation of the immune response.

Using genetically engineered wheat species, or wheat species that have been selectively bred to be minimally immunogenic, may allow the consumption of wheat. This, however, could interfere with the effects that gliadin has on the quality of dough.

Alternatively, gluten exposure can be minimised by the ingestion of a combination of enzymes (prolyl endopeptidase and a barley glutamine-specific cysteine endopeptidase (EP-B2)) that degrade the putative 33-mer peptide in the duodenum. Latiglutenase (IMGX003) is a biotheraputic digestive enzyme therapy currently being trialled that aims to degrade gluten proteins and aid gluten digestion. It was shown to mitigate intestinal mucosal damage and reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms in phase 2 clinical trials and is scheduled for phase 3 clinical trials.

Alternative treatments under investigation include the inhibition of zonulin, an endogenous signalling protein linked to increased permeability of the bowel wall and hence increased presentation of gliadin to the immune system. One inhibitor of this pathway is larazotide acetate, which is currently scheduled for phase 3 clinical trials. Other modifiers of other well-understood steps in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, such as the action of HLA-DQ2 or tissue transglutaminase and the MICA/NKG2D interaction that may be involved in the killing of enterocytes.

Attempts to modulate the immune response concerning coeliac disease are mostly still in phase I of clinical testing; one agent (CCX282-B) has been evaluated in a phase II clinical trial based on small-intestinal biopsies taken from people with coeliac disease before and after gluten exposure.

Although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a gluten-free diet is of benefit in the treatment of autism. In the subset of autistic people who have gluten sensitivity, there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve hyperactivity and mental confusion in those with autism.

<doc id="63527" wikidata="Q318734" url="?curid=63527" title="Claude Rains">
<text>William Claude Rains (10 November 188930 May 1967) was a British and American actor and military officer in World War I whose career in entertainment spanned almost seven decades. He was the recipient of numerous accolades, including four Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor, and is considered one of the screen&#x27;s great character stars who played cultured villains during the Golden Age of Hollywood.

The son of a stage actor, Rains began acting on stage in his native London in the 1900s. He became a leading thespian on the West End, and an acting teacher at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. He moved to the United States in the late 1920s and became a successful Broadway star, before making his American film debut in Dr. Jack Griffin in &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933). He went on to play prominent roles in such big screen production as &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938), &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941), &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942), &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1943) and &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946). 

In 1951, he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;. He continued to work as a prominent character actor in films, notably as Mr. Dryden in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) and his final role in the Biblical epic &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965). 

In 1960, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry. Richard Chamberlain described him as &quot;one of the finest actors of the 20th century,&quot; while Bette Davis considered him one of her favorite co-stars.

==Early life==
William Claude Rains was born on 10 November 1889 at 26 Tregothnan Road in Clapham, London. His parents were Emily Eliza (née Cox) and stage actor Frederick William Rains. He lived in the slums of London. Rains was one of twelve children, of whom all but four died while still infants. His mother took in boarders in order to support the family. Rains grew up with a Cockney accent and a speech impediment.
Because his father was an actor, the young Rains would spend time in theatres and was surrounded by actors and stagehands. There he observed actors as well as the day-to-day running of a theatre. Rains made his stage debut at age 10 in the play &quot;Sweet Nell of Old Drury&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre, so that he could run around onstage as part of the production. He slowly worked his way up in the theatre, becoming a call boy (telling actors when they were due on stage) at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and later a prompter, stage manager, understudy, and then moving on from smaller parts with good reviews to larger, better parts.
==Early career and military service==
Rains moved to the United States in 1912 owing to the opportunities that were being offered in the New York theatres. However, at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he returned to England to serve in the London Scottish Regiment, alongside fellow actors Basil Rathbone, Ronald Colman, Herbert Marshall and Cedric Hardwicke. In November 1916, Rains was involved in a gas attack at Vimy, which resulted in his permanently losing 90 percent of the vision in his right eye as well as suffering vocal cord damage. He never returned to combat but continued to serve with the Transport Workers Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment, in which he was commissioned as a temporary lieutenant on 9 May 1917. In March 1918, he was promoted to temporary captain, the rank he held at the end of the war. On 8 October 1918 he was appointed as adjutant, and continued to serve in that role until March 1919.

After his return to civilian life, Rains remained in England and continued to develop his acting talents. These talents were recognised by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, the founder of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Tree told Rains that in order to succeed as an actor, he would have to get rid of his Cockney accent and speech impediment. With this in mind, Tree paid for the elocution books and lessons that Rains needed to help him change his voice. Rains eventually shed his accent and speech impediment after practising every day. His daughter Jessica, when describing her father&#x27;s voice, said, &quot;The interesting thing to me was that he became a different person. He became a very elegant man, with a really extraordinary Mid-Atlantic accent. It was &#x27;his&#x27; voice, nobody else spoke like that, half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in.&quot; Soon after changing his accent, he became recognised as one of the leading stage actors in London. At age 29, he made his film debut, playing the role of Clarkis in his only silent film, the British film &quot;Build Thy House&quot; (1920).

During his early years, Rains taught at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA). John Gielgud and Charles Laughton were among his students. In an interview for Turner Classic Movies, Gielgud fondly remembered Rains:
==Career==
In London theatre, he achieved success in the title role of John Drinkwater&#x27;s play &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot;, the follow-up to the same playwright&#x27;s &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. Rains portrayed Faulkland in Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot;, presented at London&#x27;s Lyric Theatre in 1925. He returned to New York City in 1927 and appeared in nearly 20 Broadway roles, in plays which included George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; and dramatisations of &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; and Pearl S. Buck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (as a Chinese farmer).

Although he had played the single supporting role in the silent, &quot;Build Thy House&quot; (1920), Rains came relatively late to film acting. While working for the Theatre Guild, he was offered a screen test with Universal Pictures in 1932. His screen test for &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; (1932) for a New York representative of RKO was a failure but, according to some accounts, led to his being cast in the title role of James Whale&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933) after his screen test and unique voice were inadvertently overheard from the next room. His agent, Harold Freedman, was a family friend of Carl Laemmle, who controlled Universal Pictures at the time, and had been acquainted with Rains in London and was keen to cast him in the role. According to Rains&#x27; daughter, this was the only film of his he ever saw. He also did not go to see the rushes of the day&#x27;s filming &quot;because he told me, every time he went he was horrified by his huge face on the huge screen, that he just never went back again.&quot;

Rains signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. on 27 November 1935, with Warner able to exercise the right to loan him to other studios and Rains having a potential income of up to $750,000 over seven years. He played the villainous role of Prince John in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938). Roddy McDowall once asked Rains if he had intentionally lampooned Bette Davis in his performance as Prince John, and Rains only smiled &quot;an enigmatic smile.&quot; Rains later revealed to his daughter that he had enjoyed playing the prince as a homosexual, by using subtle mannerisms. Rains later credited the film&#x27;s co-director Michael Curtiz with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or &quot;what not to do in front of a camera.&quot; On loan to Columbia Pictures, he portrayed a corrupt but honourable U.S. senator in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. For Warner Bros., he played Dr. Alexander Tower, who commits murder-suicide to spare his daughter a life of insanity in &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942) and the cynical police chief Captain Louis Renault in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (also 1942). On loan again, Rains played the title character in Universal&#x27;s remake of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1943).

In her 1987 memoir, &quot;This &#x27;N That&quot;, Bette Davis stated that Rains (with whom she shared the screen four times in &quot;Juarez&quot;; &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;; &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot;; and &quot;Deception&quot;) was her favorite co-star. Rains became the first actor to receive a million-dollar salary when he portrayed Julius Caesar in a large-budget but unsuccessful version of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945), filmed in Britain. Shaw apparently chose him for the part, although Rains intensely disliked Gabriel Pascal, the film&#x27;s director and producer. Rains followed it with Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946) as a refugee Nazi agent opposite Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Back in Britain, he appeared in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;The Passionate Friends&quot; (1949).

His only singing and dancing role was in a 1957 television musical version of Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;, with Van Johnson as the Piper. The NBC colour special, broadcast as a film rather than a live or videotaped programme, was highly successful with the public. Sold into syndication after its first telecast, it was repeated annually by many local US TV stations.

Rains remained active as a character actor in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in films and as a guest in television series. He played the ventriloquist Fabian on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; Season 1 Episode 20 &quot;And So Died Riabouchinska&quot; which aired on February 10, 1956, and again, in 1957, Season 2 Episode 24 in &quot;The cream of the jest&quot; as a failing drunk actor. He ventured into science fiction for Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1960) and Antonio Margheriti&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Worlds&quot; (1961). Two of his late screen roles were as Dryden, a cynical British diplomat in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) and King Herod in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), his last film. In CBS&#x27;s &quot;Rawhide&quot;, he portrayed Alexander Langford, an attorney in a ghost town, in the episode &quot;Incident of Judgement Day&quot; (1963).

He additionally made several audio recordings, narrating some Bible stories for children on Capitol Records, and reciting Richard Strauss&#x27;s setting for narrator and piano of Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;Enoch Arden&quot;, with the piano solos performed by Glenn Gould. He starred in &quot;The Jeffersonian Heritage&quot;, a 1952 series of 13 half-hour radio programmes recorded by the National Association of Educational Broadcasters and syndicated for commercial broadcast on a sustaining (i.e., commercial-free) basis.

== Reception ==
Jessica Rains remembered her father&#x27;s work ethic:

Bette Davis in an interview with Dick Cavett said about Rains:

Davis later went on to describe him: &quot;Claude was witty, amusing and beautiful, really beautiful, thoroughly enchanting to be with and brilliant.&quot; She also praised his performances: &quot;He was marvelous in &quot;Deception&quot; and was worth the whole thing as the picture wasn&#x27;t terribly good, but he was so marvelous in the restaurant scene where he&#x27;s talking about all the food...brilliant, and of course in &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; he was absolutely brilliant as the husband, just brilliant.&quot;

Richard Chamberlain worked with Rains in what would be his second-to-last film, &quot;Twilight of Honor&quot;. In 2009, Chamberlain recorded a tribute to the actor when Rains was featured as Turner Classic Movies&#x27; Star of the Month:

In &quot;Twilight of Honor&quot; Rains played a retired lawyer acting as a mentor to Chamberlain&#x27;s character. Reminiscing about his work with Rains, Chamberlain said:

Many years after Rains had gone to Hollywood and become a well-known film actor, John Gielgud commented, tongue-in-cheek:
Gielgud later went on to recollect a time when he was in New York and in the audience during an event that included a focus on Bette Davis: &quot;A number of clips from many of her most successful films were shown and I was particularly delighted, when, as soon as Claude Rains appeared in the close-up of one of the clips, the whole audience burst into a great wave of applause.&quot;

Bette Davis often cited Rains as one of her favorite actors and colleagues. Gielgud said that he once wrote that &quot;The London stage suffered a great loss when Claude Rains deserted it for motion pictures,&quot; and that he later added, &quot;but when I see him now on the screen and remember him, I must admit that the London stage&#x27;s loss was the cinema&#x27;s gain. And the striking virtuosity that I witnessed as a young actor is now there for audiences everywhere to see for all time. I&#x27;m so glad of that.&quot;

==Personal life and death==

Rains became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939.

He married six times and was divorced from the first five of his wives: Isabel Jeans (married 1913–1915); Marie Hemingway (to whom Rains was married for less than a year in 1920); Beatrix Thomson (1924–8 April 1935); Frances Propper (9 April 1935 – 1956); and the classical pianist Agi Jambor (4 November 1959 – 1960). In 1960, he married Rosemary Clark Schrode, to whom he was married until her death on 31 December 1964. His only child, Jennifer, was the daughter of Frances Propper. As an actress, she is known as Jessica Rains.

He acquired the Stock Grange Farm, built in 1747 in West Bradford Township, Pennsylvania (just outside Coatesville), in 1941. The farm became one of the &quot;great prides&quot; of his life. Here, he became a &quot;gentleman farmer&quot; and could relax and enjoy farming life with his then wife (Frances) churning the butter, their daughter collecting the eggs, with Rains himself ploughing the fields and cultivating the vegetable garden. He spent much of his time between film takes reading up on agricultural techniques to try when he got home. He sold the farm when his marriage to Propper ended in 1956; the building now, as then, is still referred to by locals as &quot;Rains&#x27; Place&quot;. Rains spent his final years in Sandwich, New Hampshire.

In his final years, he decided to write his memoirs and engaged the help of journalist Jonathan Root to assist him. Rains&#x27; declining health delayed their completion and with Root&#x27;s death in March 1967 the project was never completed. A chronic alcoholic, Rains died from cirrhosis of the liver, having an abdominal hemorrhage in Laconia on 30May 1967, aged 77. His daughter said, &quot;And, just like most actors, he died waiting for his agent to call.&quot; He was buried at the Red Hill Cemetery in Moultonborough, New Hampshire. He designed his own tombstone which reads &quot;All things once, Are things forever, Soul, once living, lives forever&quot;.

In 2010, many of Rains&#x27; personal effects were put into an auction at Heritage Auctions, including his 1951 Tony award, rare posters, letters and photographs. Also included in the auction were many volumes of his private leather-bound scrapbooks which contained many of his press cuttings and reviews from the beginning of his career. The majority of the items were used to help David J. Skal write his book on Rains, &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Voice&quot;. In 2011, the ivory military uniform (complete with medals) he wore as Captain Renault in &quot;Casablanca&quot; was put up for auction when noted actress and film historian Debbie Reynolds sold her collection of Hollywood costumes and memorabilia which she had amassed as a result of the 1970 MGM auction.

== Theatre credits ==
Rains starred in multiple plays and productions over the course of his career, playing a variety of leading and supporting parts. As his film career began to flourish, he found less time to perform in the theatre in both England and America.

<doc id="63528" wikidata="Q156428" url="?curid=63528" title="Inflorescence">
<text>In botany, an inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a plant&#x27;s stem that is composed of a main branch or a system of branches. An inflorescence is categorized on the basis of the arrangement of flowers on a main axis (peduncle) and by the timing of its flowering (determinate and indeterminate).

Morphologically, an inflorescence is the modified part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed on the axis of a plant. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes.

One can also define an inflorescence as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern.

==General characteristics==
Inflorescences are described by many different characteristics including how the flowers are arranged on the peduncle, the blooming order of the flowers, and how different clusters of flowers are grouped within it. These terms are general representations as plants in nature can have a combination of types. Because flowers facilitate plant reproduction, inflorescence characteristics are largely a result of natural selection.

The stem holding the whole inflorescence is called a peduncle. The main axis (also referred to as major stem) above the peduncle bearing the flowers or secondary branches is called the rachis. The stalk of each flower in the inflorescence is called a pedicel. A flower that is not part of an inflorescence is called a solitary flower and its stalk is also referred to as a peduncle. Any flower in an inflorescence may be referred to as a floret, especially when the individual flowers are particularly small and borne in a tight cluster, such as in a pseudanthium. The fruiting stage of an inflorescence is known as an infructescence. Inflorescences may be simple (single) or complex (panicle). The rachis may be one of several types, including single, composite, umbel, spike or raceme. 

In some species the flowers develop directly from the main stem or woody trunk, rather than from the plant&#x27;s main shoot. This is called cauliflory and is found across a number of plant families. An extreme version of this is flagelliflory where long, whip-like branches grow from the main trunk to the ground and even below it. Inflorescences form directly on these branches.

===Terminal flower===
Plant organs can grow according to two different schemes, namely monopodial or racemose and sympodial or cymose. In inflorescences these two different growth patterns are called indeterminate and determinate respectively, and indicate whether a terminal flower is formed and where flowering starts within the inflorescence.
* Indeterminate inflorescence: Monopodial (racemose) growth. The terminal bud keeps growing and forming lateral flowers. A terminal flower is never formed.
* Determinate inflorescence: Sympodial (cymose) growth. The terminal bud forms a terminal flower and then dies out. Other flowers then grow from lateral buds.

Indeterminate and determinate inflorescences are sometimes referred to as open and closed inflorescences respectively. The indeterminate patterning of flowers is derived from determinate flowers. It is suggested that indeterminate flowers have a common mechanism that prevents terminal flower growth. Based on phylogenetic analyses, this mechanism arose independently multiple times in different species.

In an indeterminate inflorescence there is no true terminal flower and the stem usually has a rudimentary end. In many cases the last true flower formed by the terminal bud (subterminal flower) straightens up, appearing to be a terminal flower. Often a vestige of the terminal bud may be noticed higher on the stem.

In determinate inflorescences the terminal flower is usually the first to mature (precursive development), while the others tend to mature starting from the base of the stem. This pattern is called acropetal maturation. When flowers start to mature from the top of the stem, maturation is basipetal, whereas when the central mature first, maturation is divergent.

===Phyllotaxis===
As with leaves, flowers can be arranged on the stem according to many different patterns. See &#x27;Phyllotaxis&#x27; for in-depth descriptions.
Similarly arrangement of leaf in bud is called Ptyxis.

When a single or a cluster of flower(s) is located at the axil of a bract, the location of the bract in relation to the stem holding the flower(s) is indicated by the use of different terms and may be a useful diagnostic indicator.

Typical placement of bracts include:
* Some plants have bracts that subtend the inflorescence, where the flowers are on branched stalks; the bracts are not connected to the stalks holding the flowers, but are adnate or attached to the main stem (Adnate describes the fusing together of different unrelated parts. When the parts fused together are the same, they are connately joined.)
* Other plants have the bracts subtend the pedicel or peduncle of single flowers.

Metatopic placement of bracts include:
* When the bract is attached to the stem holding the flower (the pedicel or peduncle), it is said to be recaulescent; sometimes these bracts or bracteoles are highly modified and appear to be appendages of the flower calyx. Recaulescences is the fusion of the subtending leaf with the stem holding the bud or the bud itself, thus the leaf or bract is adnate to the stem of flower.
* When the formation of the bud is shifted up the stem distinctly above the subtending leaf, it is described as concaulescent.
==Organization==
There is no general consensus in defining the different inflorescences. The following is based on Focko Weberling&#x27;s &quot;Morphologie der Blüten und der Blütenstände&quot; (Stuttgart, 1981). The main groups of inflorescences are distinguished by branching. Within these groups, the most important characteristics are the intersection of the axes and different variations of the model. They may contain many flowers (pluriflor) or a few (pauciflor). Inflorescences can be simple or compound.

===Simple inflorescences===
====Indeterminate or racemose====
Indeterminate simple inflorescences are generally called racemose . The main kind of racemose inflorescence is the raceme (, from classical Latin &quot;racemus&quot;, cluster of grapes). The other kind of racemose inflorescences can all be derived from this one by dilation, compression, swelling or reduction of the different axes. Some passage forms between the obvious ones are commonly admitted.
* A raceme is an unbranched, indeterminate inflorescence with pedicellate (having short floral stalks) flowers along the axis.
* A spike is a type of raceme with flowers that do not have a pedicel.
* A racemose corymb is an unbranched, indeterminate inflorescence that is flat-topped or convex due to their outer pedicels which are progressively longer than inner ones.
* An umbel is a type of raceme with a short axis and multiple floral pedicels of equal length that appear to arise from a common point. It is characteristic of Umbelliferae.
* A spadix is a spike of flowers densely arranged around it, enclosed or accompanied by a highly specialised bract called a spathe. It is characteristic of the family Araceae.
* A flower head or capitulum is a very contracted raceme in which the single sessile flowers share are borne on an enlarged stem. It is characteristic of Dipsacaceae.
* A catkin or ament is a scaly, generally drooping spike or raceme. Cymose or other complex inflorescences that are superficially similar are also generally called thus.

====Determinate or cymose====

Determinate simple inflorescences are generally called cymose. The main kind of cymose inflorescence is the cyme (pronounced ), from the Latin &quot;cyma&quot; in the sense &#x27;cabbage sprout&#x27;, from Greek &quot;kuma&quot; &#x27;anything swollen&#x27;). Cymes are further divided according to this scheme:
* Only one secondary axis: monochasium
** Secondary buds always develop on the same side of the stem: helicoid cyme or bostryx
*** The successive pedicels are aligned on the same plane: drepanium
** Secondary buds develop alternately on the stem : scorpioid cyme
*** The successive pedicels are arranged in a sort of spiral: cincinnus (characteristic of the Boraginaceae and Commelinaceae)
*** The successive pedicels follow a zig-zag path on the same plane: rhipidium (many Iridaceae)
* Two secondary axes: dichasial cyme
** Secondary axis still dichasial: dichasium (characteristic of Caryophyllaceae)
** Secondary axis monochasia: double scorpioid cyme or double helicoid cyme
* More than two secondary axes: pleiochasium

A cyme can also be so compressed that it looks like an umbel. Strictly speaking this kind of inflorescence could be called umbelliform cyme, although it is normally called simply &#x27;umbel&#x27;.

Another kind of definite simple inflorescence is the raceme-like cyme or botryoid; that is as a raceme with a terminal flower and is usually improperly called &#x27;raceme&#x27;.

A reduced raceme or cyme that grows in the axil of a bract is called a fascicle. A verticillaster is a fascicle with the structure of a dichasium; it is common among the Lamiaceae. Many verticillasters with reduced bracts can form a spicate (spike-like) inflorescence that is commonly called a spike.

===Compound inflorescences===
Simple inflorescences are the basis for compound inflorescences or synflorescences. The single flowers are there replaced by a simple inflorescence, which can be both a racemose or a cymose one. Compound inflorescences are composed of branched stems and can involve complicated arrangements that are difficult to trace back to the main branch.

A kind of compound inflorescence is the double inflorescence, in which the basic structure is repeated in the place of single florets. For example, a double raceme is a raceme in which the single flowers are replaced by other simple racemes; the same structure can be repeated to form triple or more complex structures.

Compound raceme inflorescences can either end with a final raceme (homoeothetic), or not (heterothetic). A compound raceme is often called a panicle. This definition is very different from that given by Weberling.

Compound umbels are umbels in which the single flowers are replaced by many smaller umbels called umbellets. The stem attaching the side umbellets to the main stem is called a ray.

The most common kind of definite compound inflorescence is the panicle (of Webeling, or &#x27;panicle-like cyme&#x27;). A panicle is a definite inflorescence that is increasingly more strongly and irregularly branched from the top to the bottom and where each branching has a terminal flower.

The so-called cymose corymb is similar to a racemose corymb but has a panicle-like structure. Another type of panicle is the anthela. An anthela is a cymose corymb with the lateral flowers higher than the central ones.

A raceme in which the single flowers are replaced by cymes is called a (indefinite) thyrse. The secondary cymes can be of any of the different types of dichasia and monochasia. A botryoid in which the single flowers are replaced by cymes is a definite thyrse or thyrsoid. Thyrses are often confusingly called panicles.

Other combinations are possible. For example, heads or umbels may be arranged in a corymb or a panicle.

===Other===
The family Asteraceae is characterised by a highly specialised head technically called a calathid (but usually referred to as &#x27;capitulum&#x27; or &#x27;head&#x27;). The family Poaceae has a peculiar inflorescence of small spikes (spikelets) organised in panicles or spikes that are usually simply and improperly referred to as spike and panicle. The genus &quot;Ficus&quot; (Moraceae) has an inflorescence called a hypanthodium, which bears numerous flowers on the inside of a convex or involuted compound receptacle. The genus &quot;Euphorbia&quot; has cyathia (sing. &quot;cyathium&quot;), usually organised in umbels.

Some species have inflorescences reduced to composite flowers or pseudanthia, in which case it is difficult to differentiate between inflorescences and single flowers.

== Development and patterning ==

===Development===
====Genetic basis====
Genes that shape inflorescence development have been studied at great length in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;. &quot;LEAFY&quot; (LFY) is a gene that promotes floral meristem identity, regulating inflorescence development in &quot;Arabidopsis.&quot; Any alterations in timing of LFY expression can cause formation of different inflorescences in the plant. Genes similar in function to LFY include &quot;APETALA1&quot; (AP1). Mutations in LFY, AP1, and similar promoting genes can cause conversion of flowers into shoots. In contrast to LEAFY, genes like &quot;terminal flower&quot; (TFL) support the activity of an inhibitor that prevents flowers from growing on the inflorescence apex (flower primordium initiation), maintaining inflorescence meristem identity. Both types of genes help shape flower development in accordance with the ABC model of flower development. Studies have been recently conducted or are ongoing for homologs of these genes in other flower species.

==== Environmental influences ====
Inflorescence-feeding insect herbivores shape inflorescences by reducing lifetime fitness (how much flowering occurs), seed production by the inflorescences, and plant density, among other traits. In the absence of these herbivores, inflorescences usually produce more flower heads and seeds. Temperature can also variably shape inflorescence development. High temperatures can impair the proper development of flower buds or delay bud development in certain species, while in others an increase in temperature can hasten inflorescence development.

===Meristems and inflorescence architecture===
The shift from the vegetative to reproductive phase of a flower involves the development of an inflorescence meristem that generates floral meristems. Plant inflorescence architecture depends on which meristems becomes flowers and which become shoots. Consequently, genes that regulate floral meristem identity play major roles in determining inflorescence architecture because their expression domain will direct where the plant&#x27;s flowers are formed.

On a larger scale, inflorescence architecture affects quality and quantity of offspring from selfing and outcrossing, as the architecture can influence pollination success. For example, &quot;Asclepias&quot; inflorescences have been shown to have an upper size limit, shaped by self-pollination levels due to crosses between inflorescences on the same plant or between flowers on the same inflorescence. In &quot;Aesculus sylvatica&quot;, it has been shown that the most common inflorescence sizes are correlated with the highest fruit production as well.

<doc id="63531" wikidata="Q1477" url="?curid=63531" title="Ulcerative colitis">
<text>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with the other type being Crohn&#x27;s disease. It is a long-term condition that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. The primary symptoms of active disease are abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood (hematochezia). Weight loss, fever, and anemia may also occur. Often, symptoms come on slowly and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms typically occur intermittently with periods of no symptoms between flares. Complications may include abnormal dilation of the colon (megacolon), inflammation of the eye, joints, or liver, and colon cancer.

The cause of UC is unknown. Theories involve immune system dysfunction, genetics, changes in the normal gut bacteria, and environmental factors. Rates tend to be higher in the developed world with some proposing this to be the result of less exposure to intestinal infections, or to a Western diet and lifestyle. The removal of the appendix at an early age may be protective. Diagnosis is typically by colonoscopy with tissue biopsies.

Several medications are used to treat symptoms and bring about and maintain remission, including aminosalicylates such as mesalazine or sulfasalazine, steroids, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, and biologic therapy. Removal of the colon by surgery may be necessary if the disease is severe, does not respond to treatment, or if complications such as colon cancer develop. Removal of the colon and rectum generally cures the condition.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Gastrointestinal===
People with ulcerative colitis usually present with diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset that persists for an extended period of time (weeks). It is estimated that 90% of people experience rectal bleeding (of varying severity), 90% experience watery or loose stools with increased stool frequency (diarrhea), and 75-90% of people experience bowel urgency. Additional symptoms may include fecal incontinence, mucous rectal discharge, and nocturnal defecations. With proctitis (inflammation of the rectum), people with UC may experience urgency or rectal tenesmus, which is the urgent desire to evacuate the bowels but with the passage of little stool. Tenesmus may be misinterpreted as constipation, due to the urge to defecate despite small volume of stool passage. Bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain may be more prominent features in severe disease. The severity of abdominal pain with UC varies from mild discomfort to very painful bowel movements and abdominal cramping. High frequency of bowel movements, weight loss, nausea, fatigue, and fever are also common during disease flares. Chronic bleeding from the GI tract, chronic inflammation, and iron deficiency often leads to anemia, which can affect quality of life.

The clinical presentation of ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of the disease process. Up to 15% of individuals may have severe disease upon initial onset of symptoms. A substantial proportion (up to 45%) of people with a history of UC without any ongoing symptoms (clinical remission) have objective evidence of ongoing inflammation. Ulcerative colitis is associated with a generalized inflammatory process that can affect many parts of the body. Sometimes, these associated extra-intestinal symptoms are the initial signs of the disease.

====Extent of involvement====
In contrast to Crohn&#x27;s disease, which can affect areas of the gastrointestinal tract outside of the colon, ulcerative colitis is usually confined to the colon. Inflammation in ulcerative colitis is usually continuous, typically involving the rectum, with involvement extending proximally (to sigmoid colon, ascending colon, etc.). In contrast, inflammation with Crohn&#x27;s disease is often patchy, with so-called &quot;skip lesions&quot; (intermittent regions of inflamed bowel).

The disease is classified by the extent of involvement, depending on how far the disease extends: proctitis (rectal inflammation), left sided colitis (inflammation extending to descending colon), and extensive colitis (inflammation proximal to the descending colon). Proctosigmoiditis describes inflammation of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Pancolitis describes involvement of the entire colon, extending from the rectum to the cecum. While usually associated with Crohn&#x27;s disease, ileitis (inflammation of the ileum) also occurs in UC. About 17% of individuals with UC have ileitis. Ileitis more commonly occurs in the setting of pancolitis (occurring in 20% of cases of pancolitis), and tends to correlate with the activity of colitis. This so-called &quot;backwash ileitis&quot; can occur in 10–20% of people with pancolitis and is believed to be of little clinical significance.

====Severity of disease====
In addition to the extent of involvement, UC is also characterized by severity of disease. Severity of disease is defined by symptoms, objective markers of inflammation (endoscopic findings, blood tests), disease course, and the impact of the disease on day-to-day life. Most patients are categorized through endoscopy and fecal calprotectin levels. Indicators of low risk for future complications in mild and moderate UC include the following parameters: exhibiting less than 6 stools daily and lack of fever/weight loss. Other indicators include lack of extraintestinal symptoms, low levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and fecal calprotectin, and later age of diagnosis (over 40 years). Mild disease correlates with fewer than four stools daily; in addition, mild urgency and rectal bleeding may occur intermittently. Mild disease lacks systemic signs of toxicity (e.g. fever, chills, weight changes) and exhibits normal levels of the serum inflammatory markers ESR and CRP.

Moderate to severe disease correlates with more than six stools daily, frequent bloody stools and urgency. Moderate abdominal pain, low-grade fever, , and anemia may develop. ESR and CRP are usually elevated.

The Mayo Score, which incorporates a combination of clinical symptoms (stool frequency and amount of rectal bleeding) with endoscopic findings and a physicians assessment of severity, is often used clinically to classify UC as mild, moderate or severe.

Acute-Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC) is a severe form which presents acutely and with severe symptoms. This fulminant type is associated with severe symptoms (usually diarrhea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain) and is usually associated with systemic symptoms including fever. It is associated with a high mortality rate as compared to milder forms of UC, with a 3-month and 12 month mortality rate of 0.84% and 1% respectively. People with fulminant UC may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon represents a medical emergency, one often treated surgically. If the serous membrane is involved, a colonic perforation may ensue, which has a 50% mortality rate in people with UC. Other complications include hemorrhage, venous thromboembolism, and secondary infections of the colon including &quot;C. difficile&quot; or cytomegalovirus colitis.

Ulcerative colitis may improve and enter remission.

===Extraintestinal manifestations and complications===

UC is characterized by immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation, which may result in symptoms and complications outside the colon. Commonly affected organs include: eyes, joints, skin, and liver. The frequency of such extraintestinal manifestations has been reported as between 6 and 47%.

UC may affect the mouth. About 8% of individuals with UC develop oral manifestations. The two most common oral manifestations are aphthous stomatitis and angular cheilitis. Aphthous stomatitis is characterized by ulcers in the mouth, which are benign, noncontagious and often recurrent. Angular chelitis is characterized by redness at the corners of the mouth, which may include painful sores or breaks in the skin. Very rarely, benign pustules may occur in the mouth (pyostomatitis vegetans).

UC may affect the eyes manifesting in scleritis, iritis, and conjunctivitis. Patients may be asymptomatic or experience redness, burning, or itching in eyes. Inflammation may occur in the interior portion of the eye, leading to uveitis and iritis. Uveitis can cause blurred vision and eye pain, especially when exposed to light (photophobia). Untreated, uveitis can lead to permanent vision loss. Inflammation may also involve the white part of the eye (sclera) or the overlying connective tissue (episclera), causing conditions called scleritis and episcleritis. Ulcerative colitis is most commonly associated with uveitis and episcleritis.

UC may cause several joint manifestations, including a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative arthritis, which may affect few large joints (oligoarthritis), the vertebra (ankylosing spondylitis) or several small joints of the hands and feet (peripheral arthritis). Often the insertion site where muscle attaches to bone (entheses) becomes inflamed (enthesitis). Inflammation may affect the sacroiliac joint (sacroiliitis). It is estimated that around 50% of IBD patients suffer from migratory arthritis. Synovitis, or inflammation of the synovial fluid surrounding a joint, can occur for months and recur in later times but usually does not erode the joint. The symptoms of arthritis include joint pain, swelling, and effusion, and often leads to significant morbidity. Ankylosing spondylitis and sacroilitis usually occur independent of bowel disease activity in UC.

Ulcerative colitis may affect the skin. The most common type of skin manifestation, erythema nodosum, presents in up to 3% of UC patients. It develops as raised, tender red nodules usually appearing on the outer areas of the arms or legs, especially in the anterior tibial area (shins). The nodules have diameters that measure approximately 1–5 cm. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue (panniculitis), and biopsy will display focal panniculitis (although is often unnecessary in diagnosis). In contrast to joint-related manifestations, erythema nodosum often occurs alongside intestinal disease. Thus, treatment of UC can often lead to resolution of skin nodules.

Another skin condition associated with UC is pyoderma gangrenosum, which presents as deep skin ulcerations. Pyoderma gangrenosum is seen in about 1% of patients with UC and its formation is usually independent of bowel inflammation. Pyoderma gangrenosum is characterized by painful lesions or nodules that become ulcers which progressively grow. The ulcers are often filled with sterile pus-like material. In some cases, pyoderma gangrenosum may require injection with corticosteroids. Treatment may also involve inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine that promotes cell survival.

Other associations determined between the skin and ulcerative colitis include a skin condition known as hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). This condition represents a chronic process in which follicles become occluded leading to recurring inflammation of nodules and abscesses and even fistulas tunnels in the skin that drain fluid.

Ulcerative colitis may affect the circulatory and endocrine system. UC increases the risk of blood clots in both arteries and veins; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of deep venous thrombosis, while difficulty breathing may be a result of pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs). The risk of blood clots is about threefold higher in individuals with IBD. The risk of venous thromboembolism is high in ulcerative colitis due to hypercoagulability from inflammation, especially with active or extensive disease. Additional risk factors may include surgery, hospitalization, pregnancy, the use of corticosteroids and tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor.

Osteoporosis may occur related to systemic inflammation or prolonged steroid use in the treatment of UC, which increases the risk of bone fractures. Clubbing, a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may occur. Amyloidosis may occur, especially with severe and poorly controlled disease, which usually presents with protein in the urine (proteinuria) and nephritic syndrome.

===Primary sclerosing cholangitis===
Ulcerative colitis (UC) has a significant association with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a progressive inflammatory disorder of small and large bile ducts. Up to 70-90% of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis have ulcerative colitis. As many as 5% of people with UC may progress to develop primary sclerosing cholangitis. PSC is more common in men, and often begins between 30 and 40 years of age. It can present asymptomatically or exhibit symptoms of itchiness (pruritis) and fatigue. Other symptoms include systemic signs such as fever and night sweats. Such symptoms are often associated with a bacterial episodic version of PSC. Upon physical exam, one may discern enlarged liver contours (hepatomegaly) or enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) as well as areas of excoriation. Yellow coloring of the skin, or jaundice, may also be present due to excess of bile byproduct buildup (bilirubin) from the biliary tract.

In diagnosis, lab results often reveal a pattern indicative of biliary disease (cholestatic pattern). This is often displayed by markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and milder or no elevation in liver enzyme levels. Results of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) may show bile ducts with thicker walls, areas of dilation or narrowing. However, some patients with UC and PSC have inflammation that has significantly affected only ramified intrahepatic bile ducts of smaller diameter, also known as &quot;small ducts&quot;, which are not visualized by ERC.

In some cases, primary sclerosing cholangitis occurs several years before the bowel symptoms of ulcerative colitis develop. PSC does not parallel the onset, extent, duration, or activity of the colonic inflammation in ulcerative colitis. In addition, colectomy does not have an impact on the course of primary sclerosing cholangitis in individuals with UC. PSC is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). PSC is a progressive condition, and may result in cirrhosis of the liver. No specific therapy has been proven to affect the long-term course of PSC.

==Causes==

Ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cells infiltrating the colon. No direct causes for UC are known, but factors such as genetics, environment, and an overactive immune system play a role. UC is associated with comorbidities that produce symptoms in many areas of the body outside the digestive system.

===Genetic factors===
A genetic component to the cause of UC can be hypothesized based on aggregation of UC in families, variation of prevalence between different ethnicities, genetic markers and linkages. In addition, the identical twin concordance rate is 10%, whereas the dizygotic twin concordance rate is only 3%. Between 8 and 14% of people with ulcerative colitis have a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, people with a first degree relative with UC have a four-fold increase in their risk of developing the disease.

Twelve regions of the genome may be linked to UC, including, in the order of their discovery, chromosomes 16, 12, 6, 14, 5, 19, 1, and 3, but none of these loci has been consistently shown to be at fault, suggesting that the disorder is influenced by multiple genes. For example, chromosome band 1p36 is one such region thought to be linked to inflammatory bowel disease. Some of the putative regions encode transporter proteins such as OCTN1 and OCTN2. Other potential regions involve cell scaffolding proteins such as the MAGUK family. Human leukocyte antigen associations may even be at work. In fact, this linkage on chromosome 6 may be the most convincing and consistent of the genetic candidates.

Multiple autoimmune disorders are associated with ulcerative colitis, including celiac disease, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, episcleritis, and scleritis. Ulcerative colitis is also associated with acute intermittent porphyria.

===Environmental factors===
Many hypotheses have been raised for environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, including diet, breastfeeding and medications. Breastfeeding may have a protective effect in the development of ulcerative colitis. One study of isotretinoin found a small increase in the rate of UC.

As the colon is exposed to many dietary substances which may encourage inflammation, dietary factors have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease. However, research does not show a link between diet and the development of ulcerative colitis. Few studies have investigated such an association; one study showed no association of refined sugar on the number of people affected of ulcerative colitis. High intake of unsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing ulcerative colitis. Other identified dietary factors that may influence the development and/or relapse of the disease include meat protein and alcoholic beverages. Specifically, sulfur has been investigated as being involved in the cause of ulcerative colitis, but this is controversial. Sulfur restricted diets have been investigated in people with UC and animal models of the disease. The theory of sulfur as an etiological factor is related to the gut microbiota and mucosal sulfide detoxification in addition to the diet.

As a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with DuPont, three epidemiologists conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population. The studies concluded that there was an association between PFOA exposure and six health outcomes, one of which being ulcerative colitis.

===Alternative theories===
Levels of sulfate-reducing bacteria tend to be higher in persons with ulcerative colitis, which could indicate higher levels of hydrogen sulfide in the intestine. An alternative theory suggests that the symptoms of the disease may be caused by toxic effects of the hydrogen sulfide on the cells lining the intestine.

Infection by &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot;, subspecies &quot;paratuberculosis&quot;, has been proposed as the ultimate cause of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease.
==Pathophysiology==
An increased amount of colonic sulfate-reducing bacteria has been observed in some people with ulcerative colitis, resulting in higher concentrations of the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide. Human colonic mucosa is maintained by the colonic epithelial barrier and immune cells in the lamina propria (see intestinal mucosal barrier). The short-chain fatty acid &quot;n&quot;-butyrate gets oxidized through the beta oxidation pathway into carbon dioxide and ketone bodies. It has been shown that &quot;n&quot;-butyrate helps supply nutrients to this epithelial barrier. Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta-oxidation pathway by interrupting the short chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the protective effect of smoking in ulcerative colitis is due to the hydrogen cyanide from cigarette smoke reacting with hydrogen sulfide to produce the non-toxic isothiocyanate, thereby inhibiting sulfides from interrupting the pathway. An unrelated study suggested that the sulfur contained in red meats and alcohol may lead to an increased risk of relapse for people in remission.

Other proposed mechanisms driving the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis involve an abnormal immune response to the normal gut microbiota. This involves abnormal activity of antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells and macrophages. Normally, dendritic cells and macrophages patrol the intestinal epithelium and phagocytose (engulf and destroy) pathogenic microorganisms and present parts of the microorganism as antigens to T-cells to stimulate differentiation and activation of the T-cells. However, in ulcerative colitis, aberrant activity of dendritic cells and macrophages results in them phagocytosing bacteria of the normal gut microbiome. After ingesting the microbiome bacterium, the APCs release the cytokine TNFα which stimulates inflammatory signaling and recruits inflammatory cells to the intestines, leading to the inflammation that is characteristic of ulcerative colitis. The TNF inhibitors, including infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab, are used to inhibit this step during the treatment of ulcerative colitis. After phagocytosing the microbe, the APCs then enter the mesenteric lymph nodes where they present antigens to naive T-cells while also releasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 which lead to T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th17 T-cells. IL-12 and IL-23 signaling is blocked by the biologic ustekinumab and IL-23 is blocked by guselkumab, mirikizumab and risankizumab, medications that are used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. From the mesenteric lymph node, the T-cells then enter the intestinal lymphatic venule which provides transport to the intestinal epithelium where they mediate further inflammation characteristic of ulcerative colitis. The T-cells exit the lymphatic venule via the adhesion protein mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 MAdCAM-1, the ulcerative colitis biologic treatment vedolizumab inhibits T-cell migration out of the lymphatic venules by blocking binding to MAdCAM-1. While the medications ozanimod and etrasimod inhibit the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor to prevent T-cell migration into the efferent lymphatic venules. Once the mature Th1 and Th17 T-cells exit the efferent lymphatic venule, they travel to the intestinal mucosa and cause further inflammation. T-cell mediated inflammation is thought to be driven by the JAK-STAT intracellular T-cell signaling pathway, leading to the transcription, translation and release of inflammatory cytokines. This T-cell JAK-STAT signaling is inhibited by the medications tofacitinib, filgotinib and upadacitinib which are used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

==Diagnosis==
The initial diagnostic workup for ulcerative colitis consists of a complete history and physical examination, assessment of signs and symptoms, laboratory tests and endoscopy. Severe UC can exhibit high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), decreased albumin (a protein produced by the liver), and various changes in electrolytes. As discussed previously, UC patients often also display elevated alkaline phosphatase. Inflammation in the intestine may also cause higher levels of fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin.

Specific testing may include the following:
* A complete blood count is done to check for anemia; thrombocytosis, a high platelet count, is occasionally seen
* Electrolyte studies and kidney function tests are done, as chronic diarrhea may be associated with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and kidney injury.
* Liver function tests are performed to screen for bile duct involvement: primary sclerosing cholangitis.
* Imaging such as x-ray or CT scan to evaluate for possible perforation or toxic megacolon
* Stool culture and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; stool assay to rule out infectious colitis
* Inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein
* Lower endoscopy to evaluate the rectum and distal large intestine (sigmoidoscopy) or entire colon and end of the small intestine (colonoscopy) for ulcers and inflammation
Although ulcerative colitis is a disease of unknown causation, inquiry should be made as to unusual factors believed to trigger the disease.

The simple clinical colitis activity index was created in 1998 and is used to assess the severity of symptoms.

===Endoscopic===

The best test for diagnosis of ulcerative colitis remains endoscopy, which is examination of the internal surface of the bowel using a flexible camera. Initially, a flexible sigmoidoscopy may be completed to establish the diagnosis. The physician may elect to limit the extent of the initial exam if severe colitis is encountered to minimize the risk of perforation of the colon. However, a complete colonoscopy with entry into the terminal ileum should be performed to rule out Crohn&#x27;s disease, and assess extent and severity of disease. Endoscopic findings in ulcerative colitis include: erythema (redness of the mucosa), friability of the mucosa, superficial ulceration, and loss of the vascular appearance of the colon. When present, ulcerations may be confluent. Pseudopolyps may be observed.

Ulcerative colitis is usually continuous from the rectum, with the rectum almost universally being involved. Perianal disease is rare. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from proctitis (rectal inflammation) to left sided colitis (extending to descending colon), to extensive colitis (extending proximal to descending colon).

===Histologic===
Biopsies of the mucosa are taken during endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of UC and differentiate it from Crohn&#x27;s disease, which is managed differently clinically. Histologic findings in ulcerative colitis includes: distortion of crypt architecture, crypt abscesses, and inflammatory cells in the mucosa (lymphocytes, plasma cells, and granulocytes). Unlike the transmural inflammation seen in Crohn&#x27;s disease, the inflammation of ulcerative colitis is limited to the mucosa.

===Laboratory tests===
Blood and stool tests serve primarily to assess disease severity, level of inflammation and rule out causes of infectious colitis. All individuals with suspected ulcerative colitis should have stool testing to rule out infection.

A complete blood count may demonstrate anemia, leukocytosis, or thrombocytosis. Anemia may be caused by inflammation or bleeding. Chronic blood loss may lead to iron deficiency as a cause for anemia, particularly microcytic anemia (small red blood cells), which can be evaluated with a serum ferritin, iron, total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation. Anemia may be due to a complication of treatment from azathioprine, which can cause low blood counts, or sulfasalazine, which can result in folate deficiency. Thiopurine metabolites (from azathioprine) and a folate level can help.

UC may cause high levels of inflammation throughout the body, which may be quantified with serum inflammatory markers, such as CRP and ESR. However, elevated inflammatory markers are not specific for UC and elevations are commonly seen in other conditions, including infection. In addition, inflammatory markers are not uniformly elevated in people with ulcerative colitis. Twenty five percent of individuals with confirmed inflammation on endoscopic evaluation have a normal CRP level. Serum albumin may also be low related to inflammation, in addition to loss of protein in the GI tract associated with bleeding and colitis. Low serum levels of vitamin D are associated with UC, although the significance of this finding is unclear.

Specific antibody markers may be elevated in ulcerative colitis. Specifically, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) are found in 70 percent of cases of UC. Antibodies against &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; may be present, but are more often positive in Crohn&#x27;s disease compared with ulcerative colitis. However, due to poor accuracy of these serolologic tests, they are not helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of possible inflammatory bowel disease.

Several stool tests may help quantify the extent of inflammation present in the colon and rectum. Fecal calprotectin is elevated in inflammatory conditions affecting the colon, and is useful in distinguishing irritable bowel syndrome (noninflammatory) from a flare in inflammatory bowel disease. Fecal calprotectin is 88% sensitive and 79% specific for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. If the fecal calprotectin is low, the likelihood of inflammatory bowel disease are less than 1 percent. Lactoferrin is an additional nonspecific marker of intestinal inflammation.

=== Imaging ===
Overall, imaging tests, such as x-ray or CT scan, may be helpful in assessing for complications of ulcerative colitis, such as perforation or toxic megacolon. Bowel ultrasound (US) is a cost-effective, well-tolerated, non-invasive and readily available tool for the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including UC, in clinical practice. Some studies demonstrated that bowel ultrasound is an accurate tool for assessing disease activity in people with ulcerative colitis. Imaging is otherwise of limited use in diagnosing ulcerative colitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary to diagnose underlying PSC.

Abdominal xray is often the test of choice and may display nonspecific findings in cases of mild or moderate ulcerative colitis. In circumstances of severe UC, radiographic findings may include thickening of the mucosa, often termed &quot;thumbprinting&quot;, which indicates swelling due to fluid displacement (edema). Other findings may include colonic dilation and stool buildup evidencing constipation.

Similar to xray, in mild ulcerative colitis, double contrast barium enema often shows nonspecific findings. Conversely, barium enema may display small buildups of barium in microulcerations. Severe UC can be characterized by various polyps, colonic shortening, loss of haustrae (the small bulging pouches in the colon), and narrowing of the colon. It is important to note that barium enema should not be conducted in patients exhibiting very severe symptoms as this may slow or stop stool passage through the colon causing ileus and toxic megacolon.

Other methods of imaging include computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both may depict colonic wall thickening but have decreased ability to find early signs of wall changes when compared to barium enema. In cases of severe ulcerative colitis, however, they often exhibit equivalent ability to detect colonic changes.

Doppler ultrasound is the last means of imaging that may be used. Similar to the imaging methods mentioned earlier, this may show some thickened bowel wall layers. In severe cases, this may show thickening in all bowel wall layers (transmural thickness).

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Several conditions may present in a similar manner as ulcerative colitis and should be excluded. Such conditions include: Crohn&#x27;s disease, infectious colitis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy, and irritable bowel syndrome. Alternative causes of colitis should be considered, such as ischemic colitis (inadequate blood flow to the colon), radiation colitis (if prior exposure to radiation therapy), or chemical colitis. Pseudomembranous colitis may occur due to &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection following administration of antibiotics. &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; is a protozoan parasite that causes intestinal inflammation. A few cases have been misdiagnosed as UC with poor outcomes occurring due to the use of corticosteroids.

The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of ulcerative colitis is Crohn&#x27;s disease, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases since their courses and treatments may differ. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis. Crohn&#x27;s disease can be distinguished from ulcerative colitis in several ways. Characteristics that indicate Crohn&#x27;s include evidence of disease around the anus (perianal disease). This includes anal fissures and abscesses as well as fistulas, which are abnormal connections between various bodily structures.

Infectious colitis is another condition that may present in similar manner to ulcerative colitis. Endoscopic findings are also oftentimes similar. One can discern whether a patient has infectious colitis by employing tissue cultures and stool studies. Biopsy of the colon is another beneficial test but is more invasive.

Other forms of colitis that may present similarly include radiation and diversion colitis. Radiation colitis occurs after irradiation and often affects the rectum or sigmoid colon, similar to ulcerative colitis. Upon histology radiation colitis may indicate eosinophilic infiltrates, abnormal epithelial cells, or fibrosis. Diversion colitis, on the other hand, occurs after portions of bowel loops have been removed. Histology in this condition often shows increased growth of lymphoid tissue.

In patients who have undergone transplantation, graft versus host disease may also be a differential diagnosis. This response to transplantation often causes prolonged diarrhea if the colon is affected. Typical symptoms also include rash. Involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract may lead to difficulty swallowing or ulceration. Upon histology, graft versus host disease may present with crypt cell necrosis and breakdown products within the crypts themselves.

==Management==

Standard treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of involvement and disease severity. The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing remission, which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the colon&#x27;s lining, and then longer-term treatment to maintain remission and prevent complications.

For acute stages of the disease, a low fiber diet may be recommended.

===Medication===
The first-line maintenance medication for ulcerative colitis in remission is mesalazine (also known as mesalamine or 5-ASA). For patients with active disease limited to the left colon (descending colon) or proctitis, mesalazine is also the first-line agent, and a combination of suppositories and oral mesalazine may be tried. Adding corticosteroids such as prednisone is also common in active disease, especially if remission is not achieved through mesalazine monotherapy, but they are not used in long-term treatment as their risks then outweigh their benefits. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, or risankizumab are given in severe disease or if a patient cannot achieve remission with mesalazine and corticosteroids. As an alternative to mesalazine, one of its prodrugs such as sulfasalazine may be chosen for treatment of active disease or maintenance therapy, but the prodrugs have greater potential for serious side effects and have not been demonstrated to be superior to mesalazine in large trials.

A formulation of budesonide was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. In 2018, tofacitinib was approved for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in the United States, the first oral medication indicated for long term use in this condition. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Cyclosporine is effective for severe UC and tacrolimus has also shown benefits. Etrasimod was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2023.

====Aminosalicylates====
Sulfasalazine has been a major agent in the therapy of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis for over 50 years. In 1977, it was shown that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalazine/mesalamine) was the therapeutically active component in sulfasalazine. Many 5-ASA drugs have been developed with the aim of delivering the active compound to the large intestine to maintain therapeutic efficacy but with reduction of the side effects associated with the sulfapyridine moiety in sulfasalazine. Oral 5-ASA drugs are particularly effective in inducing and in maintaining remission in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Rectal suppository, foam or liquid enema formulations of 5-ASA are used for colitis affecting the rectum, sigmoid or descending colon, and have been shown to be effective especially when combined with oral treatment.

====Biologics====
Biologic treatments such as the TNF inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are commonly used to treat people with UC who are no longer responding to corticosteroids. Tofacitinib and vedolizumab can also produce good clinical remission and response rates in UC. Biologics may be used early in treatment (step down approach), or after other treatments have failed to induce remission (step up approach); the strategy should be individualized.

Unlike aminosalicylates, biologics can cause serious side effects such as an increased risk of developing extra-intestinal cancers, heart failure; and weakening of the immune system, resulting in a decreased ability of the immune system to clear infections and reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis. For this reason, people on these treatments are closely monitored and are often tested for hepatitis and tuberculosis annually.

Etrasimod, a once-daily oral sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that selectively activates S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4, and 5 with no detectable activity on S1P 2 or 3, is in development for treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including ulcerative colitis, and was shown in 2 randomized trials to be effective and well tolerated as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

====Nicotine====
Unlike Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis has a lesser chance of affecting smokers than non-smokers. In select individuals with a history of previous tobacco use, resuming low dose smoking may improve signs and symptoms of active ulcerative colitis, but it is not recommended due to the overwhelmingly negative health effects of tobacco. Studies using a transdermal nicotine patch have shown clinical and histological improvement. In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in the United Kingdom, 48.6% of people with UC who used the nicotine patch, in conjunction with their standard treatment, showed complete resolution of symptoms. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial conducted in the United States showed that 39% of people who used the patch showed significant improvement, versus 9% of those given a placebo. However, nicotine therapy is generally not recommended due to side effects and inconsistent results.

====Iron supplementation====
The gradual loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for anemia with blood tests repeated every three months in active disease and annually in quiescent disease. Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency anemia should be treated with iron supplements. The form in which treatment is administered depends both on the severity of the anemia and on the guidelines that are followed. Some advise that parenteral iron be used first because people respond to it more quickly, it is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and it is not associated with compliance issues. Others require oral iron to be used first, as people eventually respond and many will tolerate the side effects.

====Anticholinergics====
Anticholinergic drugs, more specifically muscarinic antagonists, are sometimes used to treat abdominal cramps in connection with ulcerative colitis through their calming effect on colonic peristalsis (reducing both amplitude and frequency) and intestinal tone. Some medical authorities suggest over-the-counter anticholinergic drugs as potential helpful treatments for abdominal cramping in mild ulcerative colitis. However, their use is contraindicated especially in moderate to severe disease states because of the potential for anticholinergic treatment to induce toxic megacolon in patients with colonic inflammation. Toxic megacolon is a state in which the colon is abnormally distended, and may in severe or untreated cases lead to colonic perforation, sepsis, and death.

=== Immunosuppressant therapies, infection risks and vaccinations ===

Many patients affected by ulcerative colitis need immunosuppressant therapies, which may be associated with a higher risk of contracting opportunistic infectious diseases.
Many of these potentially harmful diseases, such as Hepatitis B, Influenza, chickenpox, herpes zoster virus, pneumococcal pneumonia, or human papilloma virus, can be prevented by vaccines. Each drug used in the treatment of IBD should be classified according to the degree of immunosuppression induced in the patient. Several guidelines suggest investigating patients&#x27; vaccination status before starting any treatment and performing vaccinations against vaccine preventable diseases when required. 
Compared to the rest of the population, patients affected by IBD are known to be at higher risk of contracting some vaccine-preventable diseases. Patients treated with Janus kinase inhibitor showed higher risk of Shingles. Nevertheless, despite the increased risk of infections, vaccination rates in IBD patients are known to be suboptimal and may also be lower than vaccination rates in the general population.

===Surgery===

Unlike in Crohn&#x27;s disease, the gastrointestinal aspects of ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by surgical removal of the large intestine, though extraintestinal symptoms may persist. This procedure is necessary in the event of: exsanguinating hemorrhage, frank perforation, or documented or strongly suspected carcinoma. Surgery is also indicated for people with severe colitis or toxic megacolon. People with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life.

The removal of the entire large intestine, known as a proctocolectomy, results in a permanent ileostomy – where a stoma is created by pulling the terminal ileum through the abdomen. Intestinal contents are emptied into a removable ostomy bag which is secured around the stoma using adhesive.

Another surgical option for ulcerative colitis that is affecting most of the large bowel is called the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). This is a two- or three-step procedure. In a three-step procedure, the first surgery is a sub-total colectomy, in which the large bowel is removed, but the rectum remains in situ, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The second step is a proctectomy and formation of the ileal pouch (commonly known as a &quot;j-pouch&quot;). This involves removing the large majority of the remaining rectal stump and creating a new &quot;rectum&quot; by fashioning the end of the small intestine into a pouch and attaching it to the anus. After this procedure, a new type of ileostomy is created (known as a loop ileostomy) to allow the anastomoses to heal. The final surgery is a take-down procedure where the ileostomy is reversed and there is no longer the need for an ostomy bag. When done in two steps, a proctocolectomy – removing both the colon and rectum – is performed alongside the pouch formation and loop ileostomy. The final step is the same take-down surgery as in the three-step procedure. Time taken between each step can vary, but typically a six- to twelve-month interval is recommended between the first two steps, and a minimum of two to three months is required between the formation of the pouch and the ileostomy take-down.

While the ileal pouch procedure removes the need for an ostomy bag, it does not restore normal bowel function. In the months following the final operation, patients typically experience 8–15 bowel movements a day. Over time this number decreases, with many patients reporting 4–6 bowel movements after one year post-op. While many patients have success with this procedure, there are a number of known complications. Pouchitis, inflammation of the ileal pouch resulting in symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis, is relatively common. Pouchitis can be acute, remitting, or chronic however treatment using antibiotics, steroids, or biologics can be highly effective. Other complications include fistulas, abscesses, and pouch failure. Depending on the severity of the condition, pouch revision surgery may need to be performed. In some cased the pouch may need to be de-functioned or removed and an ileostomy recreated.

The risk of cancer arising from an ileal pouch anal anastomosis is low. However, annual surveillance with pouchoscopy may be considered in individuals with risk factors for dysplasia, such as a history of dysplasia or colorectal cancer, a history of PSC, refractory pouchitis, and severely inflamed atrophic pouch mucosa.

===Bacterial recolonization===
In a number of randomized clinical trials, probiotics have demonstrated the potential to be helpful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Specific types of probiotics such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; Nissle have been shown to induce remission in some people for up to a year.

A Cochrane review of controlled trials using various probiotics found low-certainty evidence that probiotic supplements may increase the probability of clinical remission. People receiving probiotics were 73% more likely to experience disease remission and over 2x as likely to report improvement in symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo, with no clear difference in minor or serious adverse effects. Although there was no clear evidence of greater remission when probiotic supplements were compared with 5‐aminosalicylic acid treatment as a monotherapy, the likelihood of remission was 22% higher if probiotics were used in combination with 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy.

It is unclear whether probiotics help to prevent future relapse in people with stable disease activity, either as a monotherapy or combination therapy.

Fecal microbiota transplant involves the infusion of human probiotics through fecal enemas. Ulcerative colitis typically requires a more prolonged bacteriotherapy treatment than &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection does to be successful, possibly due to the time needed to heal the ulcerated epithelium. The response of ulcerative colitis is potentially very favorable with one study reporting 67.7% of people experiencing complete remission. Other studies found a benefit from using fecal microbiota transplantation.

===Alternative medicine===
A variety of alternative medicine therapies have been used for ulcerative colitis, with inconsistent results. Curcumin (turmeric) therapy, in conjunction with taking the medications mesalamine or sulfasalazine, may be effective and safe for maintaining remission in people with quiescent ulcerative colitis. The effect of curcumin therapy alone on quiescent ulcerative colitis is unknown.

Treatments using cannabis or cannabis oil are uncertain. So far, studies have not determined its effectiveness and safety.

=== Abdominal pain management ===
Many interventions have been considered to manage abdominal pain in people with ulcerative colitis, including FODMAPs diet, relaxation training, yoga, kefir diet and stellate ganglion block treatment. It is unclear whether any of these are safe or effective at improving pain or reducing anxiety and depression.

==== Nutrition ====

Diet can play a role in symptoms of patients with ulcerative colitis.

The most avoided foods by patients are spicy foods, dairy products, alcohol, fruits and vegetables and carbonated beverages; these foods are mainly avoided during remission and to prevent relapse. In some cases, especially in the flares period, the dietary restrictions of these patients can be very severe and can lead to a compromised nutritional state. Some patients tend to eliminate gluten spontaneously, despite not having a definite diagnosis of Coeliac disease, because they believe that gluten can exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms.

===Mental health===
Many studies found that patients with IBD reported a higher frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders than the general population, and most studies confirm that women with IBD are more likely than men to develop affective disorders and show that up to 65% of them may have depression disorder and anxiety disorder.

A meta analysis of interventions to improve mood (including talking therapy, antidepressants, and exercise) in people with inflammatory bowel disease found that they reduced inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin. Psychological therapies reduced inflammation more than antidepressants or exercise.

==Prognosis==
Poor prognostic factors include: age &lt; 40 years upon diagnosis, extensive colitis, severe colitis on endoscopy, prior hospitalization, elevated CRP and low serum albumin.

===Progression or remission===
People with ulcerative colitis usually have an intermittent course, with periods of disease inactivity alternating with &quot;flares&quot; of disease. People with proctitis or left-sided colitis usually have a more benign course: only 15% progress proximally with their disease, and up to 20% can have sustained remission in the absence of any therapy. A subset of people experience a course of disease progress rapidly. In these cases, there is usually a failure to respond to medication and surgery often is performed within the first few years of disease onset. People with more extensive disease are less likely to sustain remission, but the rate of remission is independent of the severity of the disease. Several risk factors are associated with eventual need for colectomy, including: prior hospitalization for UC, extensive colitis, need for systemic steroids, young age at diagnosis, low serum albumin, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP &amp; ESR), and severe inflammation seen during colonoscopy. Surgical removal of the large intestine is necessary in some cases.

===Colorectal cancer===
The risk of colorectal cancer is significantly increased in people with ulcerative colitis after ten years if involvement is beyond the splenic flexure. People with backwash ileitis might have an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma. Those people with only proctitis usually have no increased risk. It is recommended that people have screening colonoscopies with random biopsies to look for dysplasia after eight years of disease activity, at one to two year intervals.

===Mortality===
People with ulcerative colitis are at similar or perhaps slightly increased overall risk of death compared with the background population. However, the distribution of causes-of-death differs from the general population. Specific risk factors may predict worse outcomes and a higher risk of mortality in people with ulcerative colitis, including &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection and cytomegalovirus infection (due to reactivation).

==Epidemiology==

Together with Crohn&#x27;s disease, about 11.2 million people were affected . Each year it newly occurs in 1 to 20 per 100,000 people, and 5 to 500 per 100,000 individuals are affected. The disease is more common in North America and Europe than other regions. Often it begins in people aged 15 to 30 years, or among those over 60. Males and females appear to be affected in equal proportions. It has also become more common since the 1950s. Together, ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease affect about a million people in the United States. With appropriate treatment the risk of death appears the same as that of the general population. The first description of ulcerative colitis occurred around the 1850s.

Each year, ulcerative colitis newly occurs in 1 to 20 per 100,000 people (incidence), and there are a total of 5–500 per 100,000 individuals with the disease (prevalence). In 2015, a worldwide total of 47,400 people died due to inflammatory bowel disease (UC and Crohn&#x27;s disease). The peak onset is between 30 and 40 years of age, with a second peak of onset occurring in the 6th decade of life. Ulcerative colitis is equally common among men and women. With appropriate treatment the risk of death appears similar to that of the general population. UC has become more common since the 1950s.

The geographic distribution of UC and Crohn&#x27;s disease is similar worldwide, with the highest number of new cases a year of UC found in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The disease is more common in North America and Europe than other regions. In general, higher rates are seen in northern locations compared to southern locations in Europe and the United States. UC is more common in western Europe compared with eastern Europe. Worldwide, the prevalence of UC varies from 2 to 299 per 100,000 people. Together, ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease affect about a million people in the United States.

As with Crohn&#x27;s disease, the rates of UC are greater among Ashkenazi Jews and decreases progressively in other persons of Jewish descent, non-Jewish Caucasians, Africans, Hispanics, and Asians. Appendectomy prior to age 20 for appendicitis and current tobacco use are protective against development of UC. However, former tobacco use is associated with a higher risk of developing the disease.

===United States===
, the number of new cases of UC in the United States was between 2.2 and 14.3 per 100,000 per year. The number of people affected in the United States in 2004 was between 37 and 246 per 100,000.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, between 1998 and 2000, the number of new cases per year was 12.9 per 100,000 population or 4,500 new cases. The number of people affected was estimated to be 211 per 100,000 or 104,000.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom 10 per 100,000 people newly develop the condition a year while the number of people affected is 243 per 100,000. Approximately 146,000 people in the United Kingdom have been diagnosed with UC.

==History==
The term ulcerative colitis was first used by Samuel Wilks in 1859. The term entered general medical vocabulary afterwards in 1888 with William Hale-White publishing a report of various cases of &quot;ulcerative colitis&quot;.

UC was the first subtype of IBD to be identified.

==Research==
Helminthic therapy using the whipworm &quot;Trichuris suis&quot; has been shown in a randomized control trial from Iowa to show benefit in people with ulcerative colitis. The therapy tests the hygiene hypothesis which argues that the absence of helminths in the colons of people in the developed world may lead to inflammation. Both helminthic therapy and fecal microbiota transplant induce a characteristic Th2 white cell response in the diseased areas, which was unexpected given that ulcerative colitis was thought to involve Th2 overproduction.

Alicaforsen is a first generation antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM-1 messenger RNA through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-1. ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes (white blood cells) into inflamed tissue. Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients, where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity. This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

Gram positive bacteria present in the lumen could be associated with extending the time of relapse for ulcerative colitis.

A series of drugs in development looks to disrupt the inflammation process by selectively targeting an ion channel in the inflammation signaling cascade known as KCa3.1. In a preclinical study in rats and mice, inhibition of KCa3.1 disrupted the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and TNF-α and decreased colon inflammation as effectively as sulfasalazine.

Neutrophil extracellular traps and the resulting degradation of the extracellular matrix have been reported in the colon mucosa in ulcerative colitis patients in clinical remission, indicating the involvement of the innate immune system in the etiology.

Fexofenadine, an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.

There is evidence that etrolizumab is effective for ulcerative colitis, with phase 3 trials underway as of 2016. Etrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the β7 subunit of integrins α4β7 and αEβ7, ultimately blocking migration and retention of leukocytes in the intestinal mucosa. As of early 2022, Roche halted clinical trials for the use of etrolizumab in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

A type of leukocyte apheresis, known as granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis, still requires large-scale trials to determine whether or not it is effective. Results from small trials have been tentatively positive.

<text>Lutefisk (Norwegian, ; ; ; literally &quot;lye fish&quot;) is dried whitefish, usually cod, but sometimes ling or burbot, cured in lye. It is made from aged stockfish (air-dried whitefish), or dried and salted cod. The fish takes a gelatinous texture after being rehydrated for days prior to eating.

Lutefisk is prepared as a seafood dish of several Nordic countries. It is traditionally part of the Christmas feasts Norwegian julebord, Swedish julbord, and Finnish joulupöytä.

== Origin ==

Preserved fish provided protein for generations in a part of the world with a strong fishing tradition. It is not known when people first started treating dried fish with lye. The reason was probably that the lack of major salt deposits in the area favored the drying process for the preservation of whitefish, a process known for millennia.

Stockfish is very nutrient-rich and was consumed domestically, although it was during the boom in the stockfish trade in the late Middle Ages that it became accessible throughout Scandinavia as well as the rest of Europe. Higher-quality stockfish would be soaked in water, then boiled and eaten with melted butter. Lower-quality fish would be harder and require longer boiling, using more fuel; it has been suggested that adding ash from beech or birch to the boiling water would break down the protein chains and speed up the process. The introduction of lye in the preparation process might therefore have been incidental.

== Preparation ==


The first step in preserving is soaking the fish for five to six days, with the water changed daily. The saturated lutefisk is then soaked in an unchanged solution of cold water and lye for an additional two days. The fish swells during this soaking, and its protein content decreases by more than 50 percent, producing a jelly-like consistency.

When this treatment is finished, the fish is saturated with lye and inedible, with a pH of 11–12. 

To make the fish edible, a final treatment of another four to six days of soaking in cold water changed daily is needed. The lutefisk is then ready to be cooked.

==Cooking==
After the preparation, the lutefisk is saturated with water and must therefore be cooked extremely carefully so that it does not fall to pieces.

To create a firm consistency in lutefisk, it is common to spread a layer of salt over the fish about half an hour before it is cooked, to leach some of the water out of the fish meat. The salt must be rinsed off before cooking.

Lutefisk does not need additional water for cooking; it is sufficient to place it in a pan, salt it, seal the lid tightly, and let it steam on a very low heat for 20–25 minutes. An alternative is to wrap it in aluminium foil and bake at 225 °C (435 °F) for 40–50 minutes. Another option is to parboil lutefisk, wrapped in cheesecloth, until tender. Lutefisk can also be boiled in water, or cooked in a microwave oven. The typical microwave cooking time for a whole fish, supplied as a package of two sides, is 8 to 10 minutes at high power in a covered dish, depending upon oven power.

==Eating==
Lutefisk is traditionally served with boiled potatoes, mashed green peas, melted butter and small pieces of fried bacon.

In Norway, Sweden and Finland, lutefisk is a part of the Christmas tradition and is mostly eaten with boiled potatoes, green peas and white sauce. Regional variations include a sprinkle of freshly ground allspice or black pepper and the addition of coarsely ground mustard in the white sauce (in Scania). In parts of Jämtland it is served on flatbread with whey cheese.

In the United States, lutefisk is often served with a variety of side dishes, including bacon, peas, pea stew, potatoes, lefse, gravy, mashed rutabaga, white sauce, melted or clarified butter, syrup, and geitost, or &quot;old&quot; cheese (gammelost). It is sometimes eaten with meatballs, which is not traditional in Scandinavia. Side dishes vary greatly from family to family and region to region, and can be a source of jovial contention when eaters of different traditions of lutefisk dine together.

The taste of well-prepared lutefisk is very mild, and the white sauce is often spiced with pepper or other strong-tasting spices. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, this method (seasoned with allspice) is common among Swedish-Americans, while Norwegian-Americans often prefer to eat it unseasoned with melted butter or cream sauce.

==Modern consumption==
Lutefisk as a Christmas season meal has gained attention in Norway over the past 20 years. The Norwegian Seafood Export Council indicated sales of lutefisk to restaurants and catering companies in Norway increased by 72% between 2005 and 2008. A 2005 survey found 20% of Norwegians ate lutefisk during the Christmas holiday season, although only 3% would consider it for their Christmas dinner.

Madison, Minnesota has dubbed itself the &quot;lutefisk capital of the world&quot; as well as claiming the largest per capita consumption of lutefisk in Minnesota. St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota serves lutefisk during their Christmas Festival concerts.

Many Lutheran churches across Wisconsin serve lutefisk dinners as a yearly tradition. Four popular churches are St. Olaf Lutheran Church in Dodge County, Christ Lutheran Church in DeForest, Orfordville Lutheran Church in Rock County and Northland Lutheran Church in Iola.

Lutefisk is also eaten in Canada, which has a relatively large Scandinavian population particularly in the traditionally agricultural, western inland provinces. As of 2016, there were about 463,000 Norwegian Canadians, 350,000 Swedish Canadians, 207,000 Danish Canadians and 143,000 Finnish Canadians. Organizations such as the Sons of Norway hold annual lutefisk dinners. Lutefisk is sometimes available in specialty stores and supermarkets where there are large Scandinavian populations. Kingman, Alberta proclaims itself on its greeting sign to be the &quot;Lutefisk capital of Alberta.&quot;

==Folklore==
An article in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine quotes some oft-rendered tall tales regarding the origins of the dish:

Jokes and humor about lutefisk have been cited as prevalent among Scandinavian-Americans, such as &quot;I have tried lutefisk twice, once going down, and another time coming back up.&quot;

The Season 3 &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Revenge of the Lutefisk&quot; features a plot where a new minister, Karen Stroup (Mary Tyler Moore), brings a dish of lutefisk to church to share a &quot;Minnesotan tradition&quot; in Texas. Bobby Hill secretly eats all the lutefisk, then has bad diarrhea in the church bathroom the next morning. To hide the smell, he lights a match and tosses the match in the garbage, thus accidentally burning the church down, which Stroup perceives as arson and a hate crime.

*&quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; dialog:
:Brett Clemmens: [after Becky has tossed her food tray in, splattering Amber who&#x27;s working in the cafeteria with its contents – Brett looks apologetic] Oh man...you got some lutefisk in your hair.
:Amber Atkins: (upbeat) Then it must be Wednesday!
:Iona Hildebrandt: (speaking to camera) Lutefisk is codfish that&#x27;s been salted and soaked in lye for a week or so. It&#x27;s best with lots of butter.
*In the video game &quot;Dungeons of Dredmor&quot;, there is an item called the Horadric Lutefisk Cube, which turns any item placed in it into a lutefisk. Lutefisk can be eaten, but it can also be given to the Lutefisk God.
*In the Disney animated film &quot;Frozen&quot;, a shopkeep hurls Kristoff out of his store, after which he tells Anna (in a strong Norwegian accent) &quot;I am sorry for this violence, I will add a quart of lutefisk, so we have good feelings.&quot;

<text>Eileen Evelyn Greer Garson (29 September 1904 – 6 April 1996) was a British-American actress and singer. She was a major star at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who became popular during the Second World War for her portrayal of strong women on the homefront and was listed by the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; as one of America&#x27;s top-10 box office draws from 1942 to 1946.

The fourth most-nominated woman for the Best Actress Oscar, Garson received seven Academy Award nominations, including a record-tying (with Bette Davis) five consecutive nominations (1941–1945) in the best actress category, winning for her performance in the title role as the British housewife in the 1942 film &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;.

==Early life==
Greer Garson was born on 29 September 1904 in Manor Park, East Ham (then in Essex, now part of Greater London), the only child of Nancy Sophia &quot;Nina&quot; (née Greer; 1880–1958) and George Garson (1865–1906), a commercial clerk in a London importing business. Her father was born in London to Scottish parents, and her mother was born at Drumalore (usually spelled as Drumalure or Drumaloor), a townland in County Cavan, Ireland. The name Greer is a contraction of MacGregor, another family name.

Her maternal grandfather David Greer ( 1848–1913 from Kilrea, County Londonderry), was an RIC sergeant stationed in Castlewellan, County Down. In the 1870s or 1880s, he became a land steward to the wealthy Annesley family, who built the town of Castlewellan. While there, he lived in a large detached house named Clairemount, which was built on the lower part of what was known as Pig Street, locally known as the Back Way, near Shilliday&#x27;s builder&#x27;s yard. It was erroneously reported Greer Garson was born there (&quot;The Macmillan International Film Encyclopedia&quot; gives her place of birth as County Down, and her year of birth as 1908).

Garson read French and 18th-century literature at King&#x27;s College London and did her postgraduate studies at the University of Grenoble. While aspiring to be an actress, she was appointed head of the research library of LINTAS in the marketing department of Lever Brothers. Her co-worker there, George Sanders, wrote in his autobiography that it was Garson who suggested he start a career in acting.

==Career==
Garson&#x27;s early professional appearances were on stage, starting at Birmingham Repertory Theatre in January 1932, when she was age 27. She appeared on television during its earliest years (the late 1930s), most notably starring in a 30-minute production of an excerpt of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in May 1937, with Dorothy Black. These live transmissions were part of the BBC&#x27;s pioneering television service from Alexandra Palace, and this is the first known instance of a Shakespeare play performed on television. In 1936, she appeared in the West End in Charles Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;Page From a Diary&quot;, and Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;.
Louis B. Mayer discovered Garson while he was in London looking for new talent. Garson was signed to a contract with MGM in late 1937. The actress suffered a back injury during her first 18 months at MGM while waiting for a role Mayer deemed worthy of her, and she nearly was cut from her contract.

She began work on &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, her first film, in late 1938, and she received her first Oscar nomination for the role. She received critical acclaim the next year for her role as Elizabeth Bennet in the 1940 film &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

Garson starred with Joan Crawford in &quot;When Ladies Meet&quot;, a 1941 poorly received and sanitized re-make of a pre-Code 1933 film of the same name, which had starred Ann Harding and Myrna Loy. The same year, she became a major box-office star with the sentimental Technicolor drama &quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot;, which brought her the first of five consecutive Best Actress Oscar nominations, tying Bette Davis&#x27;s record from 1938 to 1942, which still stands.

Garson starred in two Oscar-nominated films in 1942: &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; and &quot;Random Harvest&quot;. She won Best Actress for her performance as a strong British wife and mother protecting the homefront during the Second World War in &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, which co-starred Walter Pidgeon. The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; credits her with the longest Oscar acceptance speech, at five minutes and 30 seconds, after which the Academy Awards instituted a time limit.
In &quot;Random Harvest&quot; she co-starred with Ronald Colman. The drama received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor for Colman and Best Picture. The American Film Institute ranked it #36 on its list of 100 Greatest Love Stories of All Time, and it was one of Garson&#x27;s favorite films.

Garson also received Oscar nominations for her performances in the films &quot;Madame Curie&quot; (1943), &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1945). She frequently co-starred with Walter Pidgeon, ultimately making eight pictures with him: &quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot; (1941), &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942), &quot;Madame Curie&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot;, &quot;Julia Misbehaves&quot; (1948), &quot;That Forsyte Woman&quot; (1949), &quot;The Miniver Story&quot; (1950), and &quot;Scandal at Scourie&quot; (1953).
Garson starred with Clark Gable after his return from war service in &quot;Adventure&quot; (1945). The film was advertised with the catch-phrase &quot;Gable&#x27;s back, and Garson&#x27;s got him!&quot; Gable argued for &quot;He Put the Arson in Garson&quot;; she countered with &quot;She Put the Able in Gable!&quot;; thereafter, the safer catchphrase was selected.

She injured her back again while filming &quot;Desire Me&quot; in Monterey on 26 April 1946 when a wave knocked her and co-star Richard Hart from the rocks where they were rehearsing. A local fisherman and a film extra rescued Garson from the surf and potential undertow. She was bruised and in shock, and she required by doctors to rest for several days. The injury to her back required several surgeries over the coming years.

Garson&#x27;s popularity declined somewhat in the late 1940s, but she remained a prominent film star until the mid-1950s. In 1951, she became a naturalised citizen of the United States. She made only a few films after her MGM contract expired in 1954. In 1958, she received a warm reception on Broadway in &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;, replacing Rosalind Russell, who had gone back to Hollywood to make the film version. In 1960, Garson received her seventh and final Oscar nomination for &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot;, playing Eleanor Roosevelt.

Greer was a special guest on an episode of the TV series &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, playing herself. On 4 October 1956, Garson appeared with Reginald Gardiner as the first two guest stars of the series in the premiere of &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. She appeared as a mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; on 25 October 1953 and again on 6 April 1958 to promote her appearance on stage in &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;. She also served as a panelist rather than a guest on the &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; episode that aired on 12 May 1957.

She returned to MGM for a role in &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; (1966), starring Debbie Reynolds. Her last film appearance was in the 1967 Walt Disney feature &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, and she made infrequent television appearances afterward. In 1968, she narrated the children&#x27;s television special &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;. Her final role for television was in a 1982 episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

==Personal life==
Garson was married three times. Her first marriage, on 28 September 1933, was to Edward Alec Abbot Snelson (1904–1992), later Sir Edward, a British civil servant who became a noted judge and expert in Indian affairs. After a honeymoon in Germany, he returned to his appointment at Nagpur, a town in central India, and she chose to return to her mother and the theatre in Britain. Snelson reportedly grieved at losing her and would watch multiple screenings of any film of hers that played in Nagpur. The marriage was not formally dissolved until 1943.

Her second marriage, on 24 July 1943, was to Richard Ney (1916–2004), a young actor who had played her son in &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;. The relationship was under constant scrutiny owing to their 12-year age difference. MGM claimed that Garson was merely three years older than Ney and tried to portray them as a happy couple, but the marriage was troubled. They divorced in 1947, after several attempts at reconciliation. Ney eventually became a stock-market analyst, financial consultant, and author.

Her third marriage in 1949 was to E.E. &quot;Buddy&quot; Fogelson (1900–1987), a millionaire oilman and horse breeder. In 1967, the couple retired to their Forked Lightning Ranch in New Mexico. They purchased the US Hall of Fame champion Thoroughbred Ack Ack from the estate of Harry F. Guggenheim in 1971, and were successful as breeders. They also maintained a home in Dallas, where Garson funded the Greer Garson Theatre at Southern Methodist University. She founded a permanent endowment for the Fogelson Honors Forum at Texas Christian University (TCU), Buddy Fogelson&#x27;s alma mater, in nearby Fort Worth.

In 1951, Garson became a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States. She was a registered Republican, and in 1966, she was asked to run for Congress on the Republican ticket against Democrat Earle Cabell but declined. She was a devout Presbyterian.

During her later years, Garson was recognised for her philanthropy and civic leadership. She donated several million dollars for the construction of the Greer Garson Theatre at both the Santa Fe University of Art and Design and at Southern Methodist University&#x27;s Meadows School of the Arts on three conditions: 1) the stages be circular 2) the premiere production be &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and 3) they have large ladies&#x27; rooms.

===Death===
Garson lived her final years in a penthouse suite at the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, where she died from heart failure on 6 April 1996, at the age of 91. She is interred beside her husband in the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas.

==Honours==
Garson received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Southern Methodist University in 1991.

In 1993, Queen Elizabeth II recognised Garson&#x27;s achievements by investing her as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

Garson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 February 1960 located at 1651 Vine Street in Los Angeles.

==Filmography==
==Awards and nominations==
Garson won an Academy Award out of 7 nominations for Best Actress, including the most consecutive nominations, from 1941 to 1945, tied with Bette Davis.

Garson was recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:

<doc id="63539" wikidata="Q218642" url="?curid=63539" title="Alanine">
<text>Alanine (symbol Ala or A), or α-alanine, is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an amine group and a carboxylic acid group, both attached to the central carbon atom which also carries a methyl group side chain. Consequently it is classified as a nonpolar, aliphatic α-amino acid. Under biological conditions, it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated (as ) and its carboxyl group deprotonated (as ). It is non-essential to humans as it can be synthesized metabolically and does not need to be present in the diet. It is encoded by all codons starting with GC (GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG).

The -isomer of alanine (left-handed) is the one that is incorporated into proteins. -alanine is second only to -leucine in rate of occurrence, accounting for 7.8% of the primary structure in a sample of 1,150 proteins. The right-handed form, -alanine, occurs in peptides in some bacterial cell walls (in peptidoglycan) and in some peptide antibiotics, and occurs in the tissues of many crustaceans and molluscs as an osmolyte.

==History and etymology==
Alanine was first synthesized in 1850 when Adolph Strecker combined acetaldehyde and ammonia with hydrogen cyanide. The amino acid was named &quot;Alanin&quot; in German, in reference to aldehyde, with the interfix &quot;-an-&quot; for ease of pronunciation, the German ending &quot;-in&quot; used in chemical compounds being analogous to English &quot;-ine&quot;.

== Structure ==
Alanine is an aliphatic amino acid, because the side-chain connected to the α-carbon atom is a methyl group (-CH3). Alanine is the simplest α-amino acid after glycine. The methyl side-chain of alanine is non-reactive and is therefore hardly ever directly involved in protein function. Alanine is a nonessential amino acid, meaning it can be manufactured by the human body, and does not need to be obtained through the diet. Alanine is found in a wide variety of foods, but is particularly concentrated in meats.

==Sources==

===Biosynthesis===
Alanine can be synthesized from pyruvate and branched chain amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine.

Alanine is produced by reductive amination of pyruvate, a two-step process. In the first step, α-ketoglutarate, ammonia and NADH are converted by glutamate dehydrogenase to glutamate, NAD+ and water. In the second step, the amino group of the newly formed glutamate is transferred to pyruvate by an aminotransferase enzyme, regenerating the α-ketoglutarate, and converting the pyruvate to alanine. The net result is that pyruvate and ammonia are converted to alanine, consuming one reducing equivalent. Because transamination reactions are readily reversible and pyruvate is present in all cells, alanine can be easily formed and thus has close links to metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle.

===Chemical synthesis===

-Alanine is produced industrially by decarboxylation of -aspartate by the action of aspartate 4-decarboxylase. Fermentation routes to -alanine are complicated by alanine racemase.

Racemic alanine can be prepared by the condensation of acetaldehyde with ammonium chloride in the presence of sodium cyanide by the Strecker reaction,

or by the ammonolysis of 2-bromopropanoic acid. 

=== Degradation ===
Alanine is broken down by oxidative deamination, the inverse reaction of the reductive amination reaction described above, catalyzed by the same enzymes. The direction of the process is largely controlled by the relative concentration of the substrates and products of the reactions involved.

==Alanine world hypothesis==
Alanine is one of the twenty canonical α-amino acids used as building blocks (monomers) for the ribosome-mediated biosynthesis of proteins. Alanine is believed to be one of the earliest amino acids to be included in the genetic code standard repertoire. 
On the basis of this fact the &quot;alanine world&quot; hypothesis was proposed. This hypothesis explains the evolutionary choice of amino acids in the repertoire of the genetic code from a chemical point of view. In this model the selection of monomers (i.e. amino acids) for ribosomal protein synthesis is rather limited to those alanine derivatives that are suitable for building α-helix or β-sheet secondary structural elements. Dominant secondary structures in life as we know it are α-helices and β-sheets and most canonical amino acids can be regarded as chemical derivatives of alanine. Therefore, most canonical amino acids in proteins can be exchanged with alanine by point mutations while the secondary structure remains intact. The fact that alanine mimics the secondary structure preferences of the majority of the encoded amino acids is practically exploited in alanine scanning mutagenesis. In addition, classical X-ray crystallography often employs the polyalanine-backbone model to determine three-dimensional structures of proteins using molecular replacement—a model-based phasing method.

==Physiological function==
===Glucose–alanine cycle===
In mammals, alanine plays a key role in glucose–alanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, through the action of alanine aminotransferase, forming alanine and α-ketoglutarate. The alanine enters the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. The alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in reverse in the liver, where the regenerated pyruvate is used in gluconeogenesis, forming glucose which returns to the muscles through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters mitochondria and is broken down by glutamate dehydrogenase into α-ketoglutarate and ammonium, which in turn participates in the urea cycle to form urea which is excreted through the kidneys.

The glucose–alanine cycle enables pyruvate and glutamate to be removed from muscle and safely transported to the liver. Once there, pyruvate is used to regenerate glucose, after which the glucose returns to muscle to be metabolized for energy: this moves the energetic burden of gluconeogenesis to the liver instead of the muscle, and all available ATP in the muscle can be devoted to muscle contraction. It is a catabolic pathway, and relies upon protein breakdown in the muscle tissue. Whether and to what extent it occurs in non-mammals is unclear.

===Link to diabetes===
Alterations in the alanine cycle that increase the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are linked to the development of type II diabetes.

==Chemical properties==
Alanine is useful in loss of function experiments with respect to phosphorylation. Some techniques involve creating a library of genes, each of which has a point mutation at a different position in the area of interest, sometimes even every position in the whole gene: this is called &quot;scanning mutagenesis&quot;. The simplest method, and the first to have been used, is so-called alanine scanning, where every position in turn is mutated to alanine.

Hydrogenation of alanine gives the amino alcohol alaninol, which is a useful chiral building block.

===Free radical===
The deamination of an alanine molecule produces the free radical CH3C•HCO2−. Deamination can be induced in solid or aqueous alanine by radiation that causes homolytic cleavage of the carbon–nitrogen bond.

This property of alanine is used in dosimetric measurements in radiotherapy. When normal alanine is irradiated, the radiation causes certain alanine molecules to become free radicals, and, as these radicals are stable, the free radical content can later be measured by electron paramagnetic resonance in order to find out how much radiation the alanine was exposed to. This is considered to be a biologically relevant measure of the amount of radiation damage that living tissue would suffer under the same radiation exposure. Radiotherapy treatment plans can be delivered in test mode to alanine pellets, which can then be measured to check that the intended pattern of radiation dose is correctly delivered by the treatment system.

<doc id="63540" wikidata="Q178450" url="?curid=63540" title="Aspartic acid">
<text>Aspartic acid (symbol Asp or D; the ionic form is known as aspartate), is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. The -isomer of aspartic acid is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of proteins. 
-aspartic acid is one of two -amino acids commonly found in mammals. Apart from a few rare exceptions, -aspartic acid is not used for protein synthesis but is incorporated into some peptides and plays a role as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator.

Like all other amino acids, aspartic acid contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid. Its α-amino group is in the protonated –NH form under physiological conditions, while its α-carboxylic acid group is deprotonated −COO− under physiological conditions. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain (CH2COOH) which reacts with other amino acids, enzymes and proteins in the body. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, −COO−. It is a non-essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it as needed. It is encoded by the codons GAU and GAC.

In proteins aspartate sidechains are often hydrogen bonded to form asx turns or asx motifs, which frequently occur at the N-termini of alpha helices.

Aspartic acid, like glutamic acid, is classified as an acidic amino acid, with a pKa of 3.9; however, in a peptide this is highly dependent on the local environment, and could be as high as 14.

The one-letter code D for aspartate was assigned arbitrarily, with the proposed mnemonic aspar&quot;D&quot;ic acid.

==Discovery==
Aspartic acid was first discovered in 1827 by Auguste-Arthur Plisson and Étienne-Ossian Henry by hydrolysis of asparagine, which had been isolated from asparagus juice in 1806. Their original method used lead hydroxide, but various other acids or bases are now more commonly used instead.

==Forms and nomenclature==
There are two forms or enantiomers of aspartic acid. The name &quot;aspartic acid&quot; can refer to either enantiomer or a mixture of two. Of these two forms, only one, &quot;-aspartic acid&quot;, is directly incorporated into proteins. The biological roles of its counterpart, &quot;-aspartic acid&quot; are more limited. Where enzymatic synthesis will produce one or the other, most chemical syntheses will produce both forms, &quot;-aspartic acid&quot;, known as a racemic mixture.

== Synthesis ==
===Biosynthesis===
In the human body, aspartate is most frequently synthesized through the transamination of oxaloacetate. The biosynthesis of aspartate is facilitated by an aminotransferase enzyme: the transfer of an amine group from another molecule such as alanine or glutamine yields aspartate and an alpha-keto acid.

=== Chemical synthesis ===
Industrially, aspartate is produced by amination of fumarate catalyzed by L-aspartate ammonia-lyase.

Racemic aspartic acid can be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate,
(C6H4(CO)2NC(CO2Et)2).

==Metabolism==
In plants and microorganisms, aspartate is the precursor to several amino acids, including four that are essential for humans: methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and lysine. The conversion of aspartate to these other amino acids begins with reduction of aspartate to its &quot;semialdehyde&quot;, O2CCH(NH2)CH2CHO. Asparagine is derived from aspartate via transamidation:
:−O2CCH(NH2)CH2CO2− + &quot;G&quot;C(O)NH3+ → O2CCH(NH2)CH2CONH3+ + &quot;G&quot;C(O)O
(where &quot;G&quot;C(O)NH2 and &quot;G&quot;C(O)OH are glutamine and glutamic acid, respectively)

==Other biochemical roles==
Aspartate has many other biochemical roles. It is a metabolite in the urea cycle and participates in gluconeogenesis. It carries reducing equivalents in the malate-aspartate shuttle, which utilizes the ready interconversion of aspartate and oxaloacetate, which is the oxidized (dehydrogenated) derivative of malic acid. Aspartate donates one nitrogen atom in the biosynthesis of inosine, the precursor to the purine bases. In addition, aspartic acid acts as a hydrogen acceptor in a chain of ATP synthase. Dietary L-aspartic acid has been shown to act as an inhibitor of Beta-glucuronidase, which serves to regulate enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin and bile acids.

===Interactive pathway map===
===Neurotransmitter===
Aspartate (the conjugate base of aspartic acid) stimulates NMDA receptors, though not as strongly as the amino acid neurotransmitter L-glutamate does. Aspartate is the &quot;A&quot; in NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor).

== Applications &amp; market ==
In 2014, the global market for aspartic acid was or about $117 million annually. The three largest market segments include the U.S., Western Europe, and China. Current applications include biodegradable polymers (polyaspartic acid), low calorie sweeteners (aspartame), scale and corrosion inhibitors, and resins.

===Superabsorbent polymers===
One area of aspartic acid market growth is biodegradable superabsorbent polymers (SAP), and hydrogels. Around 75% of superabsorbent polymers are used in disposable diapers and an additional 20% is used for adult incontinence and feminine hygiene products. Polyaspartic acid, the polymerization product of aspartic acid, is a biodegradable substitute to polyacrylate.

===Additional uses===
In addition to SAP, aspartic acid has applications in the fertilizer industry, where polyaspartate improves water retention and nitrogen uptake.

== Sources ==
===Dietary sources===
Aspartic acid is not an essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans, and does not need to be present in the diet. In eukaryotic cells, roughly 1 in 20 amino acids incorporated into a protein is an aspartic acid, and accordingly almost any source of dietary protein will include aspartic acid. Additionally, aspartic acid is found in:
* Dietary supplements, either as aspartic acid itself or salts (such as magnesium aspartate)
* The sweetener aspartame, which is made from an aspartic acid and phenylalanine

== See also ==
* Aspartate transaminase
* Polyaspartic acid
* Sodium polyaspartate, a synthetic polyamide

<text>Glutamic acid (symbol Glu or E; known as glutamate in its anionic form) is an α-amino acid that is used by almost all living beings in the biosynthesis of proteins. It is a non-essential nutrient for humans, meaning that the human body can synthesize enough for its use. It is also the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. It serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABAergic neurons.

Its molecular formula is . Glutamic acid exists in two optically isomeric forms; the dextrorotatory -form is usually obtained by hydrolysis of gluten or from the waste waters of beet-sugar manufacture or by fermentation. Its molecular structure could be idealized as HOOC−CH()−()2−COOH, with two carboxyl groups −COOH and one amino group −. However, in the solid state and mildly acidic water solutions, the molecule assumes an electrically neutral zwitterion structure −OOC−CH()−()2−COOH. It is encoded by the codons GAA or GAG.

The acid can lose one proton from its second carboxyl group to form the conjugate base, the singly-negative anion glutamate −OOC−CH()−()2−COO−. This form of the compound is prevalent in neutral solutions. The glutamate neurotransmitter plays the principal role in neural activation. This anion creates the savory &quot;umami&quot; flavor of foods and is found in glutamate flavorings such as monosodium glutamate (MSG). In Europe, it is classified as food additive E620. In highly alkaline solutions the doubly negative anion −OOC−CH()−()2−COO− prevails. The radical corresponding to glutamate is called glutamyl.

The one-letter symbol E for glutamate was assigned as the letter following D for aspartate, as glutamate is larger by one methylene –CH2– group.

== Chemistry ==
===Ionization===

When glutamic acid is dissolved in water, the amino group (−) may gain a proton (), and/or the carboxyl groups may lose protons, depending on the acidity of the medium.

In sufficiently acidic environments, both carboxyl groups are protonated and the molecule becomes a cation with a single positive charge, HOOC−CH()−()2−COOH.

At pH values between about 2.5 and 4.1, the carboxylic acid closer to the amine generally loses a proton, and the acid becomes the neutral zwitterion −OOC−CH()−()2−COOH. This is also the form of the compound in the crystalline solid state. The change in protonation state is gradual; the two forms are in equal concentrations at pH 2.10.

At even higher pH, the other carboxylic acid group loses its proton and the acid exists almost entirely as the glutamate anion −OOC−CH()−()2−COO−, with a single negative charge overall. The change in protonation state occurs at pH 4.07. This form with both carboxylates lacking protons is dominant in the physiological pH range (7.35–7.45).

At even higher pH, the amino group loses the extra proton, and the prevalent species is the doubly-negative anion −OOC−CH()−()2−COO−. The change in protonation state occurs at pH 9.47.

===Optical isomerism===
Glutamic acid is chiral; two mirror-image enantiomers exist: (−), and (+). The form is more widely occurring in nature, but the form occurs in some special contexts, such as the bacterial capsule and cell walls of the bacteria (which produce it from the form with the enzyme glutamate racemase) and the liver of mammals.
==History==

Although they occur naturally in many foods, the flavor contributions made by glutamic acid and other amino acids were only scientifically identified early in the 20th century. The substance was discovered and identified in the year 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen, who treated wheat gluten (for which it was named) with sulfuric acid. In 1908, Japanese researcher Kikunae Ikeda of the Tokyo Imperial University identified brown crystals left behind after the evaporation of a large amount of kombu broth as glutamic acid. These crystals, when tasted, reproduced the novel flavor he detected in many foods, most especially in seaweed. Professor Ikeda termed this flavor umami. He then patented a method of mass-producing a crystalline salt of glutamic acid, monosodium glutamate.

==Synthesis==
===Biosynthesis===

===Industrial synthesis===
Glutamic acid is produced on the largest scale of any amino acid, with an estimated annual production of about 1.5 million tons in 2006. Chemical synthesis was supplanted by the aerobic fermentation of sugars and ammonia in the 1950s, with the organism &quot;Corynebacterium glutamicum&quot; (also known as &quot;Brevibacterium flavum&quot;) being the most widely used for production. Isolation and purification can be achieved by concentration and crystallization; it is also widely available as its hydrochloride salt.

== Function and uses ==

=== Metabolism ===
Glutamate is a key compound in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serve as metabolic fuel for other functional roles in the body. A key process in amino acid degradation is transamination, in which the amino group of an amino acid is transferred to an α-ketoacid, typically catalysed by a transaminase. The reaction can be generalised as such:

: R1-amino acid + R2-α-ketoacid ⇌ R1-α-ketoacid + R2-amino acid

A very common α-keto acid is α-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Transamination of α-ketoglutarate gives glutamate. The resulting α-ketoacid product is often a useful one as well, which can contribute as fuel or as a substrate for further metabolism processes. Examples are as follows:

: alanine + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ pyruvate + glutamate

: aspartate + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ oxaloacetate + glutamate

Both pyruvate and oxaloacetate are key components of cellular metabolism, contributing as substrates or intermediates in fundamental processes such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle.

Glutamate also plays an important role in the body&#x27;s disposal of excess or waste nitrogen. Glutamate undergoes deamination, an oxidative reaction catalysed by glutamate dehydrogenase, as follows:

: glutamate + H2O + NADP+ → α-ketoglutarate + NADPH + NH3 + H+

Ammonia (as ammonium) is then excreted predominantly as urea, synthesised in the liver. Transamination can thus be linked to deamination, effectively allowing nitrogen from the amine groups of amino acids to be removed, via glutamate as an intermediate, and finally excreted from the body in the form of urea.

Glutamate is also a neurotransmitter (see below), which makes it one of the most abundant molecules in the brain. Malignant brain tumors known as glioma or glioblastoma exploit this phenomenon by using glutamate as an energy source, especially when these tumors become more dependent on glutamate due to mutations in the gene IDH1.

=== Neurotransmitter ===
Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger the release of glutamate from the presynaptic cell. Glutamate acts on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors. In the opposing postsynaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor or the AMPA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, glutamate is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory in the brain. The form of plasticity known as long-term potentiation takes place at glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, neocortex, and other parts of the brain. Glutamate works not only as a point-to-point transmitter, but also through spill-over synaptic crosstalk between synapses in which summation of glutamate released from a neighboring synapse creates extrasynaptic signaling/volume transmission. In addition, glutamate plays important roles in the regulation of growth cones and synaptogenesis during brain development as originally described by Mark Mattson.

=== Brain nonsynaptic glutamatergic signaling circuits ===
Extracellular glutamate in &quot;Drosophila&quot; brains has been found to regulate postsynaptic glutamate receptor clustering, via a process involving receptor desensitization. A gene expressed in glial cells actively transports glutamate into the extracellular space, while, in the nucleus accumbens-stimulating group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, this gene was found to reduce extracellular glutamate levels. This raises the possibility that this extracellular glutamate plays an &quot;endocrine-like&quot; role as part of a larger homeostatic system.

==== GABA precursor ====
Glutamate also serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABA-ergic neurons. This reaction is catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). GABA-ergic neurons are identified (for research purposes) by revealing its activity (with the autoradiography and immunohistochemistry methods) which is most abundant in the cerebellum and pancreas.

Stiff person syndrome is a neurologic disorder caused by anti-GAD antibodies, leading to a decrease in GABA synthesis and, therefore, impaired motor function such as muscle stiffness and spasm. Since the pancreas has abundant GAD, a direct immunological destruction occurs in the pancreas and the patients will have diabetes mellitus.

=== Flavor enhancer ===

Glutamic acid, being a constituent of protein, is present in foods that contain protein, but it can only be tasted when it is present in an unbound form. Significant amounts of free glutamic acid are present in a wide variety of foods, including cheeses and soy sauce, and glutamic acid is responsible for umami, one of the five basic tastes of the human sense of taste. Glutamic acid often is used as a food additive and flavor enhancer in the form of its sodium salt, known as monosodium glutamate (MSG).

=== Nutrient ===
All meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and kombu are excellent sources of glutamic acid. Some protein-rich plant foods also serve as sources. 30% to 35% of gluten (much of the protein in wheat) is glutamic acid. Ninety-five percent of the dietary glutamate is metabolized by intestinal cells in a first pass.

=== Plant growth ===
Auxigro is a plant growth preparation that contains 30% glutamic acid.

=== NMR spectroscopy ===
In recent years, there has been much research into the use of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). A glutamic acid derivative, poly-γ-benzyl-L-glutamate (PBLG), is often used as an alignment medium to control the scale of the dipolar interactions observed.

=== Glutamate and aging ===

Brain glutamate levels tend to decline with age, and may be a useful as a marker of age-related diseases of the brain.

== Pharmacology ==
The drug phencyclidine (more commonly known as PCP or &#x27;Angel Dust&#x27;) antagonizes glutamic acid non-competitively at the NMDA receptor. For the same reasons, dextromethorphan and ketamine also have strong dissociative and hallucinogenic effects. Acute infusion of the drug eglumetad (also known as eglumegad or LY354740), an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3) resulted in a marked diminution of yohimbine-induced stress response in bonnet macaques (&quot;Macaca radiata&quot;); chronic oral administration of eglumetad in those animals led to markedly reduced baseline cortisol levels (approximately 50 percent) in comparison to untreated control subjects. Eglumetad has also been demonstrated to act on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) of human adrenocortical cells, downregulating aldosterone synthase, CYP11B1, and the production of adrenal steroids (i.e. aldosterone and cortisol). Glutamate does not easily pass the blood brain barrier, but, instead, is transported by a high-affinity transport system. It can also be converted into glutamine.

Glutamate toxicity can be reduced by antioxidants, and the psychoactive principle of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and the non psychoactive principle cannabidiol (CBD), and other cannabinoids, is found to block glutamate neurotoxicity with a similar potency, and thereby potent antioxidants.

<text>Histidine (symbol His or H) is an essential amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated –NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Initially thought essential only for infants, it has now been shown in longer-term studies to be essential for adults also. It is encoded by the codons CAU and CAC.

Histidine was first isolated by Albrecht Kossel and Sven Gustaf Hedin in 1896. The name stems from its discovery in tissue, from &quot;histós&quot; &quot;tissue&quot;. It is also a precursor to histamine, a vital inflammatory agent in immune responses. The acyl radical is histidyl.

==Properties of the imidazole side chain==
The conjugate acid (protonated form) of the imidazole side chain in histidine has a p&quot;K&quot;a of approximately 6.0. Thus, below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly protonated (as described by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation). The resulting imidazolium ring bears two NH bonds and has a positive charge. The positive charge is equally distributed between both nitrogens and can be represented with two equally important resonance structures. Sometimes, the symbol Hip is used for this protonated form instead of the usual His. Above pH 6, one of the two protons is lost. The remaining proton of the imidazole ring can reside on either nitrogen, giving rise to what are known as the N3-H or N1-H tautomers. The N3-H tautomer is shown in the figure above. In the N1-H tautomer, the NH is nearer the backbone. These neutral tautomers, also referred to as Nε and Nδ, are sometimes referred to with symbols Hie and Hid, respectively. The imidazole/imidazolium ring of histidine is aromatic at all pH values. Under certain conditions, all three ion-forming groups of histidine can be charged forming the histidinium cation.

The acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain are relevant to the catalytic mechanism of many enzymes. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine abstracts a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In carbonic anhydrases, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a zinc-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. In helices E and F of hemoglobin, histidine influences binding of dioxygen as well as carbon monoxide. This interaction enhances the affinity of Fe(II) for O2 but destabilizes the binding of CO, which binds only 200 times stronger in hemoglobin, compared to 20,000 times stronger in free heme.

The tautomerism and acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain has been characterized by 15N NMR spectroscopy. The two 15N chemical shifts are similar (about 200 ppm, relative to nitric acid on the sigma scale, on which increased shielding corresponds to increased chemical shift). NMR spectral measurements shows that the chemical shift of N1-H drops slightly, whereas the chemical shift of N3-H drops considerably (about 190 vs. 145 ppm). This change indicates that the N1-H tautomer is preferred, possibly due to hydrogen bonding to the neighboring ammonium. The shielding at N3 is substantially reduced due to the second-order paramagnetic effect, which involves a symmetry-allowed interaction between the nitrogen lone pair and the excited π* states of the aromatic ring. At pH &gt; 9, the chemical shifts of N1 and N3 are approximately 185 and 170 ppm.

===Ligand===
Histidine forms complexes with many metal ions. The imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue commonly serves as a ligand in metalloproteins. One example is the axial base attached to Fe in myoglobin and hemoglobin. Poly-histidine tags (of six or more consecutive H residues) are utilized for protein purification by binding to columns with nickel or cobalt, with micromolar affinity. Natural poly-histidine peptides, found in the venom of the viper &quot;Atheris squamigera&quot; have been shown to bind Zn(2+), Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) and affect the function of venom metalloproteases.

==Metabolism==

=== Biosynthesis ===

-Histidine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; in humans. Humans and other animals must ingest histidine or histidine-containing proteins. The biosynthesis of histidine has been widely studied in prokaryotes such as &quot;E. coli&quot;. Histidine synthesis in &quot;E. coli&quot; involves eight gene products (His1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and it occurs in ten steps. This is possible because a single gene product has the ability to catalyze more than one reaction. For example, as shown in the pathway, His4 catalyzes 4 different steps in the pathway.

Histidine is synthesized from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is made from ribose-5-phosphate by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase in the pentose phosphate pathway. The first reaction of histidine biosynthesis is the condensation of PRPP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the enzyme ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase. ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is indicated by His1 in the image. His4 gene product then hydrolyzes the product of the condensation, phosphoribosyl-ATP, producing phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP), which is an irreversible step. His4 then catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylformiminoAICAR-phosphate, which is then converted to phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P by the His6 gene product. His7 splits phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P to form -erythro-imidazole-glycerol-phosphate. After, His3 forms imidazole acetol-phosphate releasing water. His5 then makes -histidinol-phosphate, which is then hydrolyzed by His2 making histidinol. His4 catalyzes the oxidation of -histidinol to form -histidinal, an amino aldehyde. In the last step, -histidinal is converted to -histidine.

The histidine biosynthesis pathway has been studied in the fungus &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, and a gene (&quot;His-3&quot;) encoding a multienzyme complex was found that was similar to the &quot;His4&quot; gene of the bacterium &quot;E. coli&quot;. A genetic study of &quot;N. crassa&quot; histidine mutants indicated that the individual activities of the multienzyme complex occur in discrete, contiguous sections of the &quot;His-3&quot; genetic map, suggesting that the different activities of the multienzyme complex are encoded separately from each other. However, mutants were also found that lacked all three activities simultaneously, suggesting that some mutations cause loss of function of the complex as a whole.

Just like animals and microorganisms, plants need histidine for their growth and development. Microorganisms and plants are similar in that they can synthesize histidine. Both synthesize histidine from the biochemical intermediate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. In general, the histidine biosynthesis is very similar in plants and microorganisms.

==== Regulation of biosynthesis ====
This pathway requires energy in order to occur therefore, the presence of ATP activates the first enzyme of the pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase (shown as His1 in the image on the right). ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is the rate determining enzyme, which is regulated through feedback inhibition meaning that it is inhibited in the presence of the product, histidine.

=== Degradation ===
Histidine is one of the amino acids that can be converted to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle). Histidine, along with other amino acids such as proline and arginine, takes part in deamination, a process in which its amino group is removed. In prokaryotes, histidine is first converted to urocanate by histidase. Then, urocanase converts urocanate to 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. Imidazolonepropionase catalyzes the reaction to form formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) from 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. The formimino group is transferred to tetrahydrofolate, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate. Overall, these reactions result in the formation of glutamate and ammonia. Glutamate can then be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form α-ketoglutarate.

=== Conversion to other biologically active amines ===
* The histidine amino acid is a precursor for histamine, an amine produced in the body necessary for inflammation. 
* The enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase converts histidine into ammonia and urocanic acid. A deficiency in this enzyme is present in the rare metabolic disorder histidinemia, producing urocanic aciduria as a key diagnostic finding.
* Histidine can be converted to 3-methylhistidine, which serves as a biomarker for skeletal muscle damage, by certain methyltransferase enzymes. 
* Histidine is also a precursor for carnosine biosynthesis, which is a dipeptide found in skeletal muscle.
* In Actinomycetota and filamentous fungi, such as &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, histidine can be converted into the antioxidant ergothioneine.
==Requirements==
The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For histidine, for adults 19 years and older, 14 mg/kg body weight/day. Supplemental histidine is being investigated for use in a variety of different conditions, including neurological disorders, atopic dermatitis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, uraemic anaemia, ulcers, inflammatory bowel diseases, malignancies, and muscle performance during strenuous exercise.

<doc id="63543" wikidata="Q484940" url="?curid=63543" title="Isoleucine">
<text>Isoleucine (symbol Ile or I) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a hydrocarbon side chain with a branch (a central carbon atom bound to three other carbon atoms). It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), branched-chain, aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it. Essential amino acids are necessary in the human diet. In plants isoleucine can be synthesized from threonine and methionine. In plants and bacteria, isoleucine is synthesized from a pyruvate employing leucine biosynthesis enzymes. It is encoded by the codons AUU, AUC, and AUA.

== Metabolism ==

=== Biosynthesis ===
In plants and microorganisms, isoleucine is synthesized from pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate. This pathway is not present in humans. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include:
# Acetolactate synthase (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase)
# Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase
# Dihydroxyacid dehydratase
# Valine aminotransferase

=== Catabolism ===
Isoleucine is both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. After transamination with alpha-ketoglutarate, the carbon skeleton is oxidised and split into propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA, a TCA cycle intermediate which can be converted into oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (hence glucogenic). In mammals acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to carbohydrate but can be either fed into the TCA cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form citrate or used in the synthesis of ketone bodies (hence ketogenic) or fatty acids.

=== Metabolic diseases ===
The degradation of isoleucine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases:

* Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA)
* Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)
* Methylmalonic acidemia
* Propionic acidemia

=== Insulin resistance ===
Isoleucine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is associated with insulin resistance: higher levels of isoleucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of isoleucine (with or without the other branched-chain amino acids) results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Reduced dietary levels of isoleucine are required for the beneficial metabolic effects of a low protein diet. In humans, a protein restricted diet lowers blood levels of isoleucine and decreases fasting blood glucose levels. Mice fed a low isoleucine diet are leaner, live longer, and are less frail. In humans, higher dietary levels of isoleucine are associated with greater body mass index.

==Functions and requirement==
The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine has set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For adults 19 years and older, 19 mg of isoleucine/kg body weight is required daily.

Beside its biological role as a nutrient, isoleucine also participates in regulation of glucose metabolism. Isoleucine is an essential component of many proteins. As an essential amino acid, isoleucine must be ingested or protein production in the cell will be disrupted. Fetal hemoglobin is one of the many proteins that require isoleucine. Isoleucine is present in the gamma chain of fetal hemoglobin and must be present for the protein to form. 

Genetic diseases can change the consumption requirements of isoleucine. Amino acids cannot be stored in the body. Buildup of excess amino acids will cause a buildup of toxic molecules so, humans have many pathways to degrade each amino acid when the need for protein synthesis has been met. Mutations in isoleucine-degrading enzymes can lead to dangerous buildup of isoleucine and its toxic derivative. One example is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder that leaves people unable to breakdown isoleucine, valine, and leucine. People with MSUD manage their disease by a reduced intake of all three of those amino acids alongside drugs that help excrete built-up toxins. 

Many animals and plants are dietary sources of isoleucine as a component of proteins. Foods that have high amounts of isoleucine include eggs, soy protein, seaweed, turkey, chicken, lamb, cheese, and fish.

== Synthesis ==
Routes to isoleucine are numerous. One common multistep procedure starts from 2-bromobutane and diethylmalonate. Synthetic isoleucine was first reported in 1905 by French chemists Bouveault and Locquin.

== Discovery ==
German chemist Felix Ehrlich discovered isoleucine while studying the composition of beet-sugar molasses 1903. In 1907 Ehrlich carried out further studies on fibrin, egg albumin, gluten, and beef muscle in 1907. These studies verified the natural composition of isoleucine. Ehrlich published his own synthesis of isoleucine in 1908.

<doc id="63544" wikidata="Q178430" url="?curid=63544" title="Lysine">
<text>Lysine (symbol Lys or K) is an α-amino acid that is a precursor to many proteins. Lysine contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated form when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated form when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), and a side chain (which is partially protonated when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), and so it is classified as a basic, charged (in water at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is encoded by the codons AAA and AAG. Like almost all other amino acids, the α-carbon is chiral and lysine may refer to either enantiomer or a racemic mixture of both. For the purpose of this article, lysine will refer to the biologically active enantiomer -lysine, where the α-carbon is in the &quot;S&quot; configuration. 

The human body cannot synthesize lysine. It is essential in humans and must therefore be obtained from the diet. In organisms that synthesise lysine, two main biosynthetic pathways exist, the diaminopimelate and α-aminoadipate pathways, which employ distinct enzymes and substrates and are found in diverse organisms. Lysine catabolism occurs through one of several pathways, the most common of which is the saccharopine pathway.

Lysine plays several roles in humans, most importantly proteinogenesis, but also in the crosslinking of collagen polypeptides, uptake of essential mineral nutrients, and in the production of carnitine, which is key in fatty acid metabolism. Lysine is also often involved in histone modifications, and thus, impacts the epigenome. The ε-amino group often participates in hydrogen bonding and as a general base in catalysis. The ε-ammonium group () is attached to the fourth carbon from the α-carbon, which is attached to the carboxyl () group.

Due to its importance in several biological processes, a lack of lysine can lead to several disease states including defective connective tissues, impaired fatty acid metabolism, anaemia, and systemic protein-energy deficiency. In contrast, an overabundance of lysine, caused by ineffective catabolism, can cause severe neurological disorders.

Lysine was first isolated by the German biological chemist Ferdinand Heinrich Edmund Drechsel in 1889 from hydrolysis of the protein casein, and thus named it Lysin, . In 1902, the German chemists Emil Fischer and Fritz Weigert determined lysine&#x27;s chemical structure by synthesizing it.

The one-letter symbol K was assigned to lysine for being alphabetically nearest, with L being assigned to the structurally simpler leucine, and M to methionine.

==Biosynthesis==
Two pathways have been identified in nature for the synthesis of lysine. The diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway belongs to the aspartate derived biosynthetic family, which is also involved in the synthesis of threonine, methionine and isoleucine, whereas the α-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway is part of the glutamate biosynthetic family.

=== DAP pathway ===
The DAP pathway is found in both prokaryotes and plants and begins with the dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) (E.C 4.3.3.7) catalysed condensation reaction between the aspartate derived, -aspartate semialdehyde, and pyruvate to form (4&quot;S&quot;)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(2&quot;S&quot;)-dipicolinic acid (HTPA). The product is then reduced by dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DHDPR) (E.C 1.3.1.26), with NAD(P)H as a proton donor, to yield 2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDP). From this point on, four pathway variations have been found, namely the acetylase, aminotransferase, dehydrogenase, and succinylase pathways. Both the acetylase and succinylase variant pathways use four enzyme catalysed steps, the aminotransferase pathway uses two enzymes, and the dehydrogenase pathway uses a single enzyme. These four variant pathways converge at the formation of the penultimate product, &quot;meso&quot;‑diaminopimelate, which is subsequently enzymatically decarboxylated in an irreversible reaction catalysed by diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC) (E.C 4.1.1.20) to produce -lysine. The DAP pathway is regulated at multiple levels, including upstream at the enzymes involved in aspartate processing as well as at the initial DHDPS catalysed condensation step. Lysine imparts a strong negative feedback loop on these enzymes and, subsequently, regulates the entire pathway.

=== AAA pathway ===

The AAA pathway involves the condensation of α-ketoglutarate and acetyl-CoA via the intermediate AAA for the synthesis of -lysine. This pathway has been shown to be present in several yeast species, as well as protists and higher fungi. It has also been reported that an alternative variant of the AAA route has been found in &quot;Thermus thermophilus&quot; and &quot;Pyrococcus horikoshii&quot;, which could indicate that this pathway is more widely spread in prokaryotes than originally proposed. The first and rate-limiting step in the AAA pathway is the condensation reaction between acetyl-CoA and α‑ketoglutarate catalysed by homocitrate-synthase (HCS) (E.C 2.3.3.14) to give the intermediate homocitryl‑CoA, which is hydrolysed by the same enzyme to produce homocitrate. Homocitrate is enzymatically dehydrated by homoaconitase (HAc) (E.C 4.2.1.36) to yield &quot;cis&quot;-homoaconitate. HAc then catalyses a second reaction in which &quot;cis&quot;-homoaconitate undergoes rehydration to produce homoisocitrate. The resulting product undergoes an oxidative decarboxylation by homoisocitrate dehydrogenase (HIDH) (E.C 1.1.1.87) to yield α‑ketoadipate. AAA is then formed via a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase (PLP-AT) (E.C 2.6.1.39), using glutamate as the amino donor. From this point on, the AAA pathway varies with [something is missing here ? -&gt; at the very least, section header! ] on the kingdom. In fungi, AAA is reduced to α‑aminoadipate-semialdehyde via AAA reductase (E.C 1.2.1.95) in a unique process involving both adenylation and reduction that is activated by a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (E.C 2.7.8.7). Once the semialdehyde is formed, saccharopine reductase (E.C 1.5.1.10) catalyses a condensation reaction with glutamate and NAD(P)H, as a proton donor, and the imine is reduced to produce the penultimate product, saccharopine. The final step of the pathway in fungi involves the saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) (E.C 1.5.1.8) catalysed oxidative deamination of saccharopine, resulting in -lysine. In a variant AAA pathway found in some prokaryotes, AAA is first converted to &quot;N&quot;‑acetyl-α-aminoadipate, which is phosphorylated and then reductively dephosphorylated to the ε-aldehyde. The aldehyde is then transaminated to &quot;N&quot;‑acetyllysine, which is deacetylated to give -lysine. However, the enzymes involved in this variant pathway need further validation.

==Catabolism==
As with all amino acids, catabolism of lysine is initiated from the uptake of dietary lysine or from the breakdown of intracellular protein. Catabolism is also used as a means to control the intracellular concentration of free lysine and maintain a steady-state to prevent the toxic effects of excessive free lysine. There are several pathways involved in lysine catabolism but the most commonly used is the saccharopine pathway, which primarily takes place in the liver (and equivalent organs) in animals, specifically within the mitochondria. This is the reverse of the previously described AAA pathway. In animals and plants, the first two steps of the saccharopine pathway are catalysed by the bifunctional enzyme, α-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), which possess both lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) (E.C 1.5.1.8) and SDH activities, whereas in other organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, both of these enzymes are encoded by separate genes. The first step involves the LKR catalysed reduction of -lysine in the presence of α-ketoglutarate to produce saccharopine, with NAD(P)H acting as a proton donor. Saccharopine then undergoes a dehydration reaction, catalysed by SDH in the presence of NAD+, to produce AAS and glutamate. AAS dehydrogenase (AASD) (E.C 1.2.1.31) then further dehydrates the molecule into AAA. Subsequently, PLP-AT catalyses the reverse reaction to that of the AAA biosynthesis pathway, resulting in AAA being converted to α-ketoadipate. The product, α‑ketoadipate, is decarboxylated in the presence of NAD+ and coenzyme A to yield glutaryl-CoA, however the enzyme involved in this is yet to be fully elucidated. Some evidence suggests that the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex (OADHc), which is structurally homologous to the E1 subunit of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc) (E.C 1.2.4.2), is responsible for the decarboxylation reaction. Finally, glutaryl-CoA is oxidatively decarboxylated to crotonyl-CoA by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (E.C 1.3.8.6), which goes on to be further processed through multiple enzymatic steps to yield acetyl-CoA; an essential carbon metabolite involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA).

== Nutritional value ==
Lysine is an essential amino acid in humans. The human daily nutritional requirement varies from ~60 mg/kg in infancy to ~30 mg/kg in adults. This requirement is commonly met in a western society with the intake of lysine from meat and vegetable sources well in excess of the recommended requirement. In vegetarian diets, the intake of lysine is less due to the limited quantity of lysine in cereal crops compared to meat sources.

Given the limiting concentration of lysine in cereal crops, it has long been speculated that the content of lysine can be increased through genetic modification practices. Often these practices have involved the intentional dysregulation of the DAP pathway by means of introducing lysine feedback-insensitive orthologues of the DHDPS enzyme. These methods have met limited success likely due to the toxic side effects of increased free lysine and indirect effects on the TCA cycle. Plants accumulate lysine and other amino acids in the form of seed storage proteins, found within the seeds of the plant, and this represents the edible component of cereal crops. This highlights the need to not only increase free lysine, but also direct lysine towards the synthesis of stable seed storage proteins, and subsequently, increase the nutritional value of the consumable component of crops. While genetic modification practices have met limited success, more traditional selective breeding techniques have allowed for the isolation of &quot;Quality Protein Maize&quot;, which has significantly increased levels of lysine and tryptophan, also an essential amino acid. This increase in lysine content is attributed to an &quot;opaque-2&quot; mutation that reduced the transcription of lysine-lacking zein-related seed storage proteins and, as a result, increased the abundance of other proteins that are rich in lysine. Commonly, to overcome the limiting abundance of lysine in livestock feed, industrially produced lysine is added. The industrial process includes the fermentative culturing of &quot;Corynebacterium glutamicum&quot; and the subsequent purification of lysine.

=== Dietary sources ===
Good sources of lysine are high-protein foods such as eggs, meat (specifically red meat, lamb, pork, and poultry), soy, beans and peas, cheese (particularly Parmesan), and certain fish (such as cod and sardines). Lysine is the limiting amino acid (the essential amino acid found in the smallest quantity in the particular foodstuff) in most cereal grains, but is plentiful in most pulses (legumes). Beans contain the lysine that maize lacks, and in the human archeological record beans and maize often appear together, as in the Three Sisters: beans, maize, and squash.

A food is considered to have sufficient lysine if it has at least 51 mg of lysine per gram of protein (so that the protein is 5.1% lysine). -lysine HCl is used as a dietary supplement, providing 80.03% -lysine. As such, 1 g of -lysine is contained in 1.25 g of -lysine HCl.

== Biological roles ==
The most common role for lysine is proteinogenesis. Lysine frequently plays an important role in protein structure. Since its side chain contains a positively charged group on one end and a long hydrophobic carbon tail close to the backbone, lysine is considered somewhat amphipathic. For this reason, lysine can be found buried as well as more commonly in solvent channels and on the exterior of proteins, where it can interact with the aqueous environment. Lysine can also contribute to protein stability as its ε-amino group often participates in hydrogen bonding, salt bridges and covalent interactions to form a Schiff base.

A second major role of lysine is in epigenetic regulation by means of histone modification. There are several types of covalent histone modifications, which commonly involve lysine residues found in the protruding tail of histones. Modifications often include the addition or removal of an acetyl (−CH3CO) forming acetyllysine or reverting to lysine, up to three methyl (−CH3), ubiquitin or a sumo protein group. The various modifications have downstream effects on gene regulation, in which genes can be activated or repressed.

Lysine has also been implicated to play a key role in other biological processes including; structural proteins of connective tissues, calcium homeostasis, and fatty acid metabolism. Lysine has been shown to be involved in the crosslinking between the three helical polypeptides in collagen, resulting in its stability and tensile strength. This mechanism is akin to the role of lysine in bacterial cell walls, in which lysine (and &quot;meso&quot;-diaminopimelate) are critical to the formation of crosslinks, and therefore, stability of the cell wall. This concept has previously been explored as a means to circumvent the unwanted release of potentially pathogenic genetically modified bacteria. It was proposed that an auxotrophic strain of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (X1776) could be used for all genetic modification practices, as the strain is unable to survive without the supplementation of DAP, and thus, cannot live outside of a laboratory environment. Lysine has also been proposed to be involved in calcium intestinal absorption and renal retention, and thus, may play a role in calcium homeostasis. Finally, lysine has been shown to be a precursor for carnitine, which transports fatty acids to the mitochondria, where they can be oxidised for the release of energy. Carnitine is synthesised from trimethyllysine, which is a product of the degradation of certain proteins, as such lysine must first be incorporated into proteins and be methylated prior to being converted to carnitine. However, in mammals the primary source of carnitine is through dietary sources, rather than through lysine conversion.

In opsins like rhodopsin and the visual opsins (encoded by the genes OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW), retinaldehyde forms a Schiff base with a conserved lysine residue, and interaction of light with the retinylidene group causes signal transduction in color vision (See visual cycle for details).

=== Disputed roles ===
There has been a long discussion that lysine, when administered intravenously or orally, can significantly increase the release of growth hormones. This has led to athletes using lysine as a means of promoting muscle growth while training, however, no significant evidence to support this application of lysine has been found to date.

Because herpes simplex virus (HSV) proteins are richer in arginine and poorer in lysine than the cells they infect, lysine supplements have been tried as a treatment. Since the two amino acids are taken up in the intestine, reclaimed in the kidney, and moved into cells by the same amino acid transporters, an abundance of lysine would, in theory, limit the amount of arginine available for viral replication. Clinical studies do not provide good evidence for effectiveness as a prophylactic or in the treatment for HSV outbreaks. In response to product claims that lysine could improve immune responses to HSV, a review by the European Food Safety Authority found no evidence of a cause–effect relationship. The same review, published in 2011, found no evidence to support claims that lysine could lower cholesterol, increase appetite, contribute to protein synthesis in any role other than as an ordinary nutrient, or increase calcium absorption or retention.

== Roles in disease ==
Diseases related to lysine are a result of the downstream processing of lysine, i.e. the incorporation into proteins or modification into alternative biomolecules. The role of lysine in collagen has been outlined above, however, a lack of lysine and hydroxylysine involved in the crosslinking of collagen peptides has been linked to a disease state of the connective tissue. As carnitine is a key lysine-derived metabolite involved in fatty acid metabolism, a substandard diet lacking sufficient carnitine and lysine can lead to decreased carnitine levels, which can have significant cascading effects on an individual&#x27;s health. Lysine has also been shown to play a role in anaemia, as lysine is suspected to have an effect on the uptake of iron and, subsequently, the concentration of ferritin in blood plasma. However, the exact mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated. Most commonly, lysine deficiency is seen in non-western societies and manifests as protein-energy malnutrition, which has profound and systemic effects on the health of the individual. There is also a hereditary genetic disease that involves mutations in the enzymes responsible for lysine catabolism, namely the bifunctional AASS enzyme of the saccharopine pathway. Due to a lack of lysine catabolism, the amino acid accumulates in plasma and patients develop hyperlysinaemia, which can present as asymptomatic to severe neurological disabilities, including epilepsy, ataxia, spasticity, and psychomotor impairment. The clinical significance of hyperlysinemia is the subject of debate in the field with some studies finding no correlation between physical or mental disabilities and hyperlysinemia. In addition to this, mutations in genes related to lysine metabolism have been implicated in several disease states, including pyridoxine-dependent epilepsia (ALDH7A1 gene), α-ketoadipic and α-aminoadipic aciduria (DHTKD1 gene), and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GCDH gene).

Hyperlysinuria is marked by high amounts of lysine in the urine. It is often due to a metabolic disease in which a protein involved in the breakdown of lysine is non functional due to a genetic mutation. It may also occur due to a failure of renal tubular transport.

==Use of lysine in animal feed==
Lysine production for animal feed is a major global industry, reaching in 2009 almost 700,000 tons for a market value of over €1.22 billion. Lysine is an important additive to animal feed because it is a limiting amino acid when optimizing the growth of certain animals such as pigs and chickens for the production of meat. Lysine supplementation allows for the use of lower-cost plant protein (maize, for instance, rather than soy) while maintaining high growth rates, and limiting the pollution from nitrogen excretion. In turn, however, phosphate pollution is a major environmental cost when corn is used as feed for poultry and swine.

Lysine is industrially produced by microbial fermentation, from a base mainly of sugar. Genetic engineering research is actively pursuing bacterial strains to improve the efficiency of production and allow lysine to be made from other substrates. The most common bacteria used is Corynebacterium glutamicum specially mutagenized or gene-engineered to produce lysine, but analogous strains of Escherichia coli are also employed.

==In popular culture==
The 1993 film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, which is based on the 1990 novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; by Michael Crichton, features dinosaurs that were genetically altered so that they could not produce lysine, an example of engineered auxotrophy. This was known as the &quot;lysine contingency&quot; and was supposed to prevent the cloned dinosaurs from surviving outside the park, forcing them to depend on lysine supplements provided by the park&#x27;s veterinary staff. In reality, no animal can produce lysine; it is an essential amino acid.

In 1996, lysine became the focus of a price-fixing case, the largest in United States history. The Archer Daniels Midland Company paid a fine of US$100 million, and three of its executives were convicted and served prison time. Also found guilty in the price-fixing case were two Japanese firms (Ajinomoto, Kyowa Hakko) and a South Korean firm (Sewon). Secret video recordings of the conspirators fixing lysine&#x27;s price can be found online or by requesting the video from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division. This case gave the basis for the book &quot;The Informant: A True Story&quot;, and the movie &quot;The Informant!&quot;.

In the 2009 episode of the American sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, entitled The Friendship Algorithm, Sheldon is trying to befriend his work nemesis, Barry Kripke, to get time on some equipment he needs for an experiment. He gives his current group of friends a questionnaire so that he may get some insight into why they are friends. One of the questions is, &quot;What is Sheldon&#x27;sfavorite amino acid?&quot; Raj states that he had lysine, which is Sheldon&#x27;s favorite, but changed it.

<doc id="63546" wikidata="Q483745" url="?curid=63546" title="Leucine">
<text>Leucine (symbol Leu or L) is an essential amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Leucine is an α-amino acid, meaning it contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain isobutyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it; it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, and beans and other legumes. It is encoded by the codons UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG. Leucine is named after the Greek word for &quot;white&quot;: &quot;λευκός&quot; (&quot;leukós&quot;, &quot;white&quot;), after its common appearance as a white powder, a property it shares with many other amino acids. 

Like valine and isoleucine, leucine is a branched-chain amino acid. The primary metabolic end products of leucine metabolism are acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; consequently, it is one of the two exclusively ketogenic amino acids, with lysine being the other. It is the most important ketogenic amino acid in humans.

Leucine and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid, a minor leucine metabolite, exhibit pharmacological activity in humans and have been demonstrated to promote protein biosynthesis via the phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR).

==Dietary leucine==
As a food additive, L-leucine has E number E641 and is classified as a flavor enhancer.

===Requirements===
The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For leucine, for adults 19 years and older, 42 mg/kg body weight/day.

===Sources ===
==Health effects==
As a dietary supplement, leucine has been found to slow the degradation of muscle tissue by increasing the synthesis of muscle proteins in aged rats. However, results of comparative studies are conflicted. Long-term leucine supplementation does not increase muscle mass or strength in healthy elderly men. More studies are needed, preferably ones based on an objective, random sample of society. Factors such as lifestyle choices, age, gender, diet, exercise, etc. must be factored into the analyses to isolate the effects of supplemental leucine as a stand-alone, or if taken with other branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Until then, dietary supplemental leucine cannot be associated as the prime reason for muscular growth or optimal maintenance for the entire population.

Both L-leucine and D-leucine protect mice against epileptic seizures. D-leucine also terminates seizures in mice after the onset of seizure activity, at least as effectively as diazepam and without sedative effects. Decreased dietary intake of L-leucine lessens adiposity in mice. High blood levels of leucine are associated with insulin resistance in humans, mice, and rodents. This might be due to the effect of leucine to stimulate mTOR signaling. Dietary restriction of leucine and the other BCAAs can reverse diet-induced obesity in wild-type mice by increasing energy expenditure, and can restrict fat mass gain of hyperphagic rats.

==Safety==
Leucine toxicity, as seen in decompensated maple syrup urine disease, causes delirium and neurologic compromise, and can be life-threatening.

A high intake of leucine may cause or exacerbate symptoms of pellagra in people with low niacin status because it interferes with the conversion of L-tryptophan to niacin.

Leucine at a dose exceeding 500 mg/kg/d was observed with hyperammonemia. As such, unofficially, a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for leucine in healthy adult men can be suggested at 500 mg/kg/d or 35 g/d under acute dietary conditions.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Leucine is a dietary amino acid with the capacity to directly stimulate myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis. This effect of leucine results from its role as an activator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine protein kinase that regulates protein biosynthesis and cell growth. The activation of mTOR by leucine is mediated through Rag GTPases, leucine binding to leucyl-tRNA synthetase, leucine binding to sestrin 2, and possibly other mechanisms.

===Metabolism in humans===
Leucine metabolism occurs in many tissues in the human body; however, most dietary leucine is metabolized within the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue. Adipose and muscle tissue use leucine in the formation of sterols and other compounds. Combined leucine use in these two tissues is seven times greater than in the liver.

A small fraction of metabolism – less than 5% in all tissues except the testes, where it accounts for about 33% – is initially catalyzed by leucine aminomutase, producing β-leucine, which is subsequently metabolized into (β-KIC), β-ketoisocaproyl-CoA, and then acetyl-CoA by a series of uncharacterized enzymes.

==Synthesis in nonhuman organisms==
Leucine is an essential amino acid in the diet of animals because they lack the complete enzyme pathway to synthesize it &quot;de novo&quot; from potential precursor compounds. Consequently, they must ingest it, usually as a component of proteins. Plants and microorganisms synthesize leucine from pyruvic acid with a series of enzymes:
* Acetolactate synthase
* Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase
* Dihydroxyacid dehydratase
* α-Isopropylmalate synthase
* α-Isopropylmalate isomerase
* Leucine aminotransferase

Synthesis of the small, hydrophobic amino acid valine also includes the initial part of this pathway.

==Chemistry==

Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) since it possesses an aliphatic side chain that is not linear.

Racemic leucine had been subjected to circularly polarized synchrotron radiation to better understand the origin of biomolecular asymmetry. An enantiomeric enhancement of 2.6% had been induced, indicating a possible photochemical origin of biomolecules&#x27; homochirality.

<doc id="63547" wikidata="Q1527888" url="?curid=63547" title="Pancreatitis">
<text>Pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and a number of hormones. There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis, a fever may occur; symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis, weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs.
The two most common causes of acute pancreatitis are a gallstone blocking the common bile duct after the pancreatic duct has joined; and heavy alcohol use. Other causes include direct trauma, certain medications, infections such as mumps, and tumors. Chronic pancreatitis may develop as a result of acute pancreatitis. It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats, high blood calcium, some medications, and certain genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase. In chronic pancreatitis, these tests may be normal. Medical imaging such as ultrasound and CT scan may also be useful.
Acute pancreatitis is usually treated with intravenous fluids, pain medication, and sometimes antibiotics. For patients with severe pancreatitis who cannot tolerate normal oral food consumption, a nasogastric tube is placed in the stomach. A procedure known as an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be done to examine the distal common bile duct and remove a gallstone if present. In those with gallstones the gallbladder is often also removed. In chronic pancreatitis, in addition to the above, temporary feeding through a nasogastric tube may be used to provide adequate nutrition. Long-term dietary changes and pancreatic enzyme replacement may be required. Occasionally, surgery is done to remove parts of the pancreas.
Globally, in 2015 about 8.9 million cases of pancreatitis occurred. This resulted in 132,700 deaths, up from 83,000 deaths in 1990. Acute pancreatitis occurs in about 30 per 100,000 people a year. New cases of chronic pancreatitis develop in about 8 per 100,000 people a year and currently affect about 50 per 100,000 people in the United States. It is more common in men than women. Often chronic pancreatitis starts between the ages of 30 and 40 and is rare in children. Acute pancreatitis was first described on autopsy in 1882 while chronic pancreatitis was first described in 1946.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptoms of pancreatitis are severe upper abdominal or left upper quadrant burning pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting that is worse with eating. The physical examination will vary depending on severity and presence of internal bleeding. Blood pressure may be elevated by pain or decreased by dehydration or bleeding. Heart and respiratory rates are often elevated. The abdomen is usually tender but to a lesser degree than the pain itself. As is common in abdominal disease, bowel sounds may be reduced from reflex bowel paralysis. Fever or jaundice may be present. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes or pancreatic cancer. Unexplained weight loss may occur from a lack of pancreatic enzymes hindering digestion.

===Complications===
Early complications include shock, infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, low blood calcium, high blood glucose, and dehydration. Blood loss, dehydration, and fluid leaking into the abdominal cavity (ascites) can lead to kidney failure. Respiratory complications are often severe. Pleural effusion is usually present. Shallow breathing from pain can lead to lung collapse. Pancreatic enzymes may attack the lungs, causing inflammation. Severe inflammation can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, further impairing renal and respiratory function and potentially requiring management with an open abdomen to relieve the pressure.

Late complications include recurrent pancreatitis and the development of pancreatic pseudocysts—collections of pancreatic secretions that have been walled off by scar tissue. These may cause pain, become infected, rupture and bleed, block the bile duct and cause jaundice, or migrate around the abdomen. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis can lead to a pancreatic abscess, a collection of pus caused by necrosis, liquefaction, and infection. This happens in approximately 3% of cases or almost 60% of cases involving more than two pseudocysts and gas in the pancreas.

==Causes==
About 80 percent of pancreatitis cases are caused by gallstones or alcohol. Choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the bile duct) are the single most common cause of acute pancreatitis, and alcoholism is the single most common cause of chronic pancreatitis. Serum triglyceride levels greater than 1000 mg/dL (11.29 mmol/L, i.e. hyperlipidemia) is another cause.

The mnemonic &quot;GET SMASHED&quot; is often used to help clinicians and medical students remember the common causes of pancreatitis: Gallstones, Ethanol, Trauma, Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune, Scorpion sting, Hyperlipidemia, hypothermia or hyperparathyroidism, ERCP, Drugs (commonly azathioprine, valproic acid, liraglutide).

===Medications===
There are seven classes of medications associated with acute pancreatitis: statins, ACE inhibitors, oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT), diuretics, antiretroviral therapy, valproic acid, and oral hypoglycemic agents. Mechanisms of these drugs causing pancreatitis are not known exactly, but it is possible that statins have direct toxic effect on the pancreas or through the long-term accumulation of toxic metabolites. Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors cause angioedema of the pancreas through the accumulation of bradykinin. Birth control pills and HRT cause arterial thrombosis of the pancreas through the accumulation of fat (hypertriglyceridemia). Diuretics such as furosemide have a direct toxic effect on the pancreas. Meanwhile, thiazide diuretics cause hypertriglyceridemia and hypercalcemia, where the latter is the risk factor for pancreatic stones.

HIV infection itself can cause a person to be more likely to get pancreatitis. Meanwhile, antiretroviral drugs may cause metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia, which predisposes to pancreatitis. Valproic acid may have direct toxic effect on the pancreas. Various oral hypoglycemic agents are associated with pancreatitis including metformin, but glucagon-like peptide-1 mimetics such as exenatide are more strongly associated with pancreatitis by promoting inflammation in combination with a high-fat diet.

Atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine can also cause pancreatitis.

===Infection===
A number of infectious agents have been recognized as causes of pancreatitis including:
* Viruses
** Coxsackie virus
** Cytomegalovirus
** Hepatitis B
** Herpes simplex virus
** Mumps
** Varicella-zoster virus
* Bacteria
** Legionella
** Leptospira
** Mycoplasma
** Salmonella
* Fungi
** Aspergillus
* Parasites
** Ascaris
** Cryptosporidium
** Toxoplasma

===Other===
Other common causes include trauma, autoimmune disease, high blood calcium, hypothermia, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Pancreas divisum is a common congenital malformation of the pancreas that may underlie some recurrent cases. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is associated with a 2.8-fold higher risk.

Less common causes include pancreatic cancer, pancreatic duct stones, vasculitis (inflammation of the small blood vessels in the pancreas), and porphyria—particularly acute intermittent porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria.

There is an inherited form that results in the activation of trypsinogen within the pancreas, leading to autodigestion. Involved genes may include trypsin 1, which codes for trypsinogen, SPINK1, which codes for a trypsin inhibitor, or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.

==Diagnosis==
The differential diagnosis for pancreatitis includes but is not limited to cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, perforated peptic ulcer, bowel infarction, small bowel obstruction, hepatitis, and mesenteric ischemia.

Diagnosis requires 2 of the 3 following criteria:
* Characteristic acute onset of epigastric or vague abdominal pain that may radiate to the back (see signs and symptoms above)
* Serum amylase or lipase levels ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal
* An imaging study with characteristic changes. CT, MRI, abdominal ultrasound or endoscopic ultrasound can be used for diagnosis.

Amylase and lipase are 2 enzymes produced by the pancreas. Elevations in lipase are generally considered a better indicator for pancreatitis as it has greater specificity and has a longer half life. However, both enzymes can be elevated in other disease states. In chronic pancreatitis, the fecal pancreatic elastase-1 (FPE-1) test is a marker of exocrine pancreatic function. Additional tests that may be useful in evaluating chronic pancreatitis include hemoglobin A1C, immunoglobulin G4, rheumatoid factor, and anti-nuclear antibody.

For imaging, abdominal ultrasound is convenient, simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive. It is more sensitive and specific for pancreatitis from gallstones than other imaging modalities. However, in 25–35% of patients the view of the pancreas can be obstructed by bowel gas making it difficult to evaluate.

A contrast-enhanced CT scan is usually performed more than 48 hours after the onset of pain to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis and extrapancreatic fluid as well as predict the severity of the disease. CT scanning earlier can be falsely reassuring.

ERCP or an endoscopic ultrasound can also be used if a biliary cause for pancreatitis is suspected.

==Treatment==
The treatment for acute pancreatitis will depend on whether the diagnosis is for the mild form of the condition, which typically resolves without treatment, or the severe form, which can cause serious complications. Patients with mild AP should still be hospitalized, at least briefly, to receive IV fluids and for clinical monitoring purposes.

=== Pain management ===
Acute pancreatitis typically presents with severe to extreme abdominal pain. While the mildest cases of pancreatitis may be managed exclusively with NSAIDs (which are preferred in such scenarios due to the anti-inflammatory effects and the better safety profile), most patients with pancreatitis require heavy opioid regimens for pain therapy. Severe cases often require continuous IV infusions of opioid medications. It is appropriate for emergent cases of pancreatitis to be treated with these medications immediately, rather than attempting to control the pain with lesser medications first.

The early use of strong pain management therapies does not affect the ability for the physician to diagnose the cause of severe abdominal pain. Thus, pain management should not be reduced or withheld for the purposes of diagnosis in cases of suspected pancreatitis.

=== Fluid resuscitation ===
Regardless of disease severity, moderately aggressive fluid resuscitation is advisable for all patients with acute pancreatitis, especially if they can be diagnosed and treated early in the course of the disease. The preferred fluid for administration is lactated Ringer solution, but saline may also be used. Patients with acute pancreatitis of any severity are typically hypovolemic (decreased blood volume), and this hypovolemia can result in hypoperfusion of pancreatic cells. Without blood supplying them, the pancreatic cells can become necrotic, resulting in tissue death that can become further worsened by the strong inflammatory response that occurs following necrosis.

=== Managing infection ===
Infection is a major cause of mortality in patients with pancreatitis, and these patients are known to be prone to infections in a variety of organ systems. The majority of patients with pancreatitis have damage to the gut barrier, allowing gut bacteria to bypass this barrier and cause infection. Some species of gut bacteria are also known to detect pancreatitis and respond by releasing their own pro-inflammatory molecules. Conversely, a healthy microbiome is beneficial for preventing infection, and several gut bacteria are known to augment human immune defenses and reduce systemic inflammation.

===Mild acute pancreatitis===
The treatment of mild acute pancreatitis is successfully carried out by admission to a general hospital ward for fluid resuscitation and patient monitoring. Traditionally, people were not allowed to eat until the inflammation resolved but more recent evidence suggests early feeding is safe and improves outcomes and may result in an ability to leave the hospital sooner, and guidelines have been updated to recommend early feeding for patients able to tolerate it.

Opioids may be used for the pain. When the pancreatitis is due to gallstones, or even for patients without gallstones and no other identifiable cause, early gallbladder removal also appears to improve outcomes.

===Severe acute pancreatitis===
Severe pancreatitis can cause organ failure, necrosis, infected necrosis, pseudocyst, and abscess. If diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, people will need to be admitted to a high-dependency unit or intensive care unit. It is likely that the levels of fluids inside the body will have dropped significantly as it diverts bodily fluids and nutrients in an attempt to repair the pancreas. The drop in fluid levels can lead to a rapid and severe reduction in the volume of blood within the body, which is known as hypovolemic shock. This condition represents a major life threat and may be prevented in some cases by prompt and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Patients with severe AP are often unable to receive oral nutrition, and so nasogastric feeding tubes are commonly used for these patients. Feeding tubes may be used to provide calories and nutrients, combined with appropriate analgesia. Early enteral feeding within 48 hours of admission to the hospital has been associated with better outcomes.

The lungs can be inflamed as a result of the systemic inflammatory response and can manifest as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Supplemental oxygen is frequently required in the treatment of severe AP, and a patient may be given anything from supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, to full mechanical ventilation. In many cases, even the most intensive respiratory therapies are not enough, and many patients with severe pancreatitis die as a result of respiratory failure.

As with mild pancreatitis, it will be necessary to treat the underlying cause—gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an ERCP procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. There is also evidence that, even for patients without gallstones, surgical removal of the gallbladder may reduce the risk of recurrence, and as of 2024, guidelines recommend the procedure for any patient with severe pancreatitis with no clear cause.

If the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, many doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process. Patients whose pancreatitis can be linked to alcoholism are known to have a much higher risk of recurrence.

==Prognosis==
Severe acute pancreatitis has mortality rates around 2–9%, higher where necrosis of the pancreas has occurred.

Several scoring systems are used to predict the severity of an attack of pancreatitis. They each combine demographic and laboratory data to estimate severity or probability of death. Examples include APACHE II, Ranson, BISAP, and Glasgow. The Modified Glasgow criteria suggests that a case be considered severe if at least three of the following are true:
* Age &gt; 55 years
* Blood levels:
** PO2 oxygen &lt; 60 mmHg or 7.9 kPa
** White blood cells &gt; 15,000/μL
** Calcium &lt; 2 mmol/L
** Blood urea nitrogen &gt; 16 mmol/L
** Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 600iu/L
** Aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt; 200iu/L
** Albumin &lt; 3.2g/L
** Glucose &gt; 10 mmol/L

This can be remembered using the mnemonic PANCREAS:
* PO2 oxygen &lt; 60 mmHg or 7.9 kPa
* Age &gt; 55
* Neutrophilia white blood cells &gt; 15,000/μL
* Calcium &lt; 2 mmol/L
* Renal function (BUN) &gt; 16 mmol/L
* Enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 600iu/L aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt; 200iu/L
* Albumin &lt; 3.2g/L
* Sugar glucose &gt; 10 mmol/L

The BISAP score (blood urea nitrogen level &gt;25 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L), impaired mental status, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, age over 60 years, pleural effusion) has been validated as similar to other prognostic scoring systems.

==Epidemiology==
Globally the incidence of acute pancreatitis is 5 to 35 cases per 100,000 people. The incidence of chronic pancreatitis is 4–8 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 26–42 cases per 100,000. In 2013 pancreatitis resulted in 123,000 deaths up from 83,000 deaths in 1990.

==Costs==
In adults in the United Kingdom, the estimated average total direct and indirect costs of chronic pancreatitis is roughly £79,000 per person on an annual basis. Acute recurrent pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis occur infrequently in children, but are associated with high healthcare costs due to substantial disease burden. Globally, the estimated average total cost of treatment for children with these conditions is approximately $40,500/person/year.

==Other animals==
Fatty foods may cause canine pancreatitis in dogs.

<text>Asparagine (symbol Asn or N) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain carboxamide, classifying it as a polar (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it. It is encoded by the codons AAU and AAC.

The one-letter symbol N for asparagine was assigned arbitrarily, with the proposed mnemonic asparagi&quot;N&quot;e;

==History==
Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 in a crystalline form by French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet (then a young assistant). It was isolated from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant, hence the chosen name. It was the first amino acid to be isolated.

Three years later, in 1809, Pierre Jean Robiquet identified a substance from liquorice root with properties which he qualified as very similar to those of asparagine, and which Plisson identified in 1828 as asparagine itself.

The determination of asparagine&#x27;s structure required decades of research. The empirical formula for asparagine was first determined in 1833 by the French chemists Antoine François Boutron Charlard and Théophile-Jules Pelouze; in the same year, the German chemist Justus Liebig provided a more accurate formula. In 1846 the Italian chemist Raffaele Piria treated asparagine with nitrous acid, which removed the molecule&#x27;s amine (–NH2) groups and transformed asparagine into malic acid. This revealed the molecule&#x27;s fundamental structure: a chain of four carbon atoms. Piria thought that asparagine was a diamide of malic acid; however, in 1862 the German chemist Hermann Kolbe showed that this surmise was wrong; instead, Kolbe concluded that asparagine was an amide of an amine of succinic acid. In 1886, the Italian chemist Arnaldo Piutti (1857–1928) discovered a mirror image or &quot;enantiomer&quot; of the natural form of asparagine, which shared many of asparagine&#x27;s properties, but which also differed from it. Since the structure of asparagine was still not fully known – the location of the amine group within the molecule was still not settled – Piutti synthesized asparagine and thus published its true structure in 1888.

== Structural function in proteins ==
Since the asparagine side-chain can form hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagine residues are often found near the beginning of alpha-helices as asx turns and asx motifs, and in similar turn motifs, or as amide rings, in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as &quot;capping&quot; the hydrogen bond interactions that would otherwise be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone.

Asparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, modification of the protein chain with the addition of carbohydrate chains. Typically, a carbohydrate tree can solely be added to an asparagine residue if the latter is flanked on the C side by X-serine or X-threonine, where X is any amino acid with the exception of proline.

Asparagine can be hydroxylated in the HIF1 hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. This modification inhibits HIF1-mediated gene activation.

==Sources==

===Dietary sources===
Asparagine is not essential for humans, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates and is not required in the diet. 

Asparagine is found in:
* Animal sources: dairy, whey, beef, poultry, eggs, fish, lactalbumin, seafood
* Plant sources: seaweed (spirulina), potatoes, soy protein isolate, tofu

=== Biosynthesis and catabolism===
The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate, which a transaminase enzyme converts to aspartate. The enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing α-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. Asparagine synthetase uses ATP to activate aspartate, forming β-aspartyl-AMP. Glutamine donates an ammonium group, which reacts with β-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP.

In reaction that is the reverse of its biosynthesis, asparagine is hydrolyzed to aspartate by asparaginase. Aspartate then undergoes transamination to form glutamate and oxaloacetate from alpha-ketoglutarate. Oxaloacetate, which enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle).

===Acrylamide controversy===
Heating a mixture of asparagine and reducing sugars or other source of carbonyls produces acrylamide in food. These products occur in baked goods such as French fries, potato chips, and toasted bread. Acrylamide is converted in the liver to glycidamide, which is a possible carcinogen.

== Function ==
Asparagine synthetase is required for normal development of the brain. Asparagine is also involved in protein synthesis during replication of poxviruses.

The addition of &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine to asparagine is performed by oligosaccharyltransferase enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum. This glycosylation is involved in protein structure and function.

<text>Glutamine (symbol Gln or Q) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Its side chain is similar to that of glutamic acid, except the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an amide. It is classified as a charge-neutral, polar amino acid. It is non-essential and conditionally essential in humans, meaning the body can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body&#x27;s demand for glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. It is encoded by the codons CAA and CAG. It is named after glutamic acid, which in turn is named after its discovery in cereal proteins, gluten.

In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid.

The dietary sources of glutamine include especially the protein-rich foods like beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, vegetables like beans, beets, cabbage, spinach, carrots, parsley, vegetable juices and also in wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery, kale and fermented foods like miso.

The one-letter symbol Q for glutamine was assigned in alphabetical sequence to N for asparagine, being larger by merely one methylene –CH2– group. Note that P was used for proline, and O was avoided due to similarity with D. The mnemonic &quot;Q&quot;lutamine was also proposed.

== Functions ==
Glutamine plays a role in a variety of biochemical functions:
* Protein synthesis, as any other of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids
* Lipid synthesis, especially by cancer cells.
* Regulation of acid-base balance in the kidney by producing ammonium
* Cellular energy, as a source, next to glucose
* Nitrogen donation for many anabolic processes, including the synthesis of purines
* Carbon donation, as a source, refilling the citric acid cycle
* Nontoxic transporter of ammonia in the blood circulation.
* Integrity of healthy intestinal mucosa, though small randomized trials have shown no benefit in Crohn&#x27;s disease.

=== Roles in metabolism ===
Glutamine maintains redox balance by participating in glutathione synthesis and contributing to anabolic processes such as lipid synthesis by reductive carboxylation.

Glutamine provides a source of carbon and nitrogen for use in other metabolic processes. Glutamine is present in serum at higher concentrations than other amino acids and is essential for many cellular functions. Examples include the synthesis of nucleotides and non-essential amino acids. One of the most important functions of glutamine is its ability to be converted into α-KG, which helps to maintain the flow of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, generating ATP via the electron carriers NADH and FADH2. The highest consumption of glutamine occurs in the cells of the intestines, kidney cells (where it is used for acid-base balance), activated immune cells, and many cancer cells.

==Production==
Glutamine is produced industrially using mutants of &quot;Brevibacterium flavum&quot;, which gives ca. 40 g/L in 2 days using glucose as a carbon source.

===Biosynthesis===
Glutamine synthesis from glutamate and ammonia is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase. The majority of glutamine production occurs in muscle tissue, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lungs and brain. Although the liver is capable of glutamine synthesis, its role in glutamine metabolism is more regulatory than productive, as the liver takes up glutamine derived from the gut via the hepatic portal system.

== Uses ==
=== Nutrition ===
Glutamine is the most abundant naturally occurring, nonessential amino acid in the human body, and one of the few amino acids that can directly cross the blood–brain barrier. Humans obtain glutamine through catabolism of proteins in foods they eat. In states where tissue is being built or repaired, like growth of babies, or healing from wounds or severe illness, glutamine becomes conditionally essential.

=== Sickle cell disease ===

In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved -glutamine oral powder, marketed as Endari, to reduce severe complications of sickle cell disease in people aged five years and older with the disorder.

The safety and efficacy of L-glutamine oral powder were studied in a randomized trial of subjects ages five to 58 years old with sickle cell disease who had two or more painful crises within the 12 months prior to enrollment in the trial. Subjects were assigned randomly to treatment with L-glutamine oral powder or placebo, and the effect of treatment was evaluated over 48 weeks. Subjects who were treated with L-glutamine oral powder experienced fewer hospital visits for pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac (sickle cell crises), on average, compared to subjects who received a placebo (median 3 vs. median 4), fewer hospitalizations for sickle cell pain (median 2 vs. median 3), and fewer days in the hospital (median 6.5 days vs. median 11 days). Subjects who received L-glutamine oral powder also had fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome (a life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease) compared with patients who received a placebo (8.6 percent vs. 23.1 percent).

Common side effects of L-glutamine oral powder include constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in the extremities, back pain and chest pain.

L-glutamine oral powder received orphan drug designation. The FDA granted the approval of Endari to Emmaus Medical Inc.

=== Medical food ===
Glutamine is marketed as medical food and is prescribed when a medical professional believes a person in their care needs supplementary glutamine due to metabolic demands beyond what can be met by endogenous synthesis or diet.

== Safety ==
Glutamine is safe in adults and in preterm infants. Although glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, both of which have neurological effects, their concentrations are not increased much, and no adverse neurological effects were detected. The observed safe level for supplemental -glutamine in normal healthy adults is 14 g/day.

Adverse effects of glutamine have been described for people receiving home parenteral nutrition and those with liver-function abnormalities.
Although glutamine has no effect on the proliferation of tumor cells, it is still possible that glutamine supplementation may be detrimental in some cancer types.

Ceasing glutamine supplementation in people adapted to very high consumption may initiate a withdrawal effect, raising the risk of health problems such as infections or impaired integrity of the intestine.

== Structure ==
Glutamine can exist in either of two enantiomeric forms, -glutamine and -glutamine. The -form is found in nature. Glutamine contains an α-amino group which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions and a carboxylic acid group which is in the deprotonated −COO− form, known as carboxylate, under physiological conditions.

==Research==
Glutamine mouthwash may be useful to prevent oral mucositis in people undergoing chemotherapy but intravenous glutamine does not appear useful to prevent mucositis in the GI tract.

Glutamine supplementation was thought to have potential to reduce complications in people who are critically ill or who have had abdominal surgery but this was based on poor quality clinical trials. Supplementation does not appear to be useful in adults or children with Crohn&#x27;s disease or inflammatory bowel disease, but clinical studies as of 2016 were underpowered. Supplementation does not appear to have an effect in infants with significant problems of the stomach or intestines.

Some athletes use -glutamine as supplement. Studies support the positive effects of the chronic oral administration of the supplement on the injury and inflammation induced by intense aerobic and exhaustive exercise, but the effects on muscle recovery from weight training are unclear.

Stress conditions for plants (drought, injury, soil salnity) cause the synthesis of such plant enzymes as superoxide dismutase, L-ascorbate oxidase, and Delta 1 DNA polymerase. Limiting this process, initiated by the conditions of strong soil salinity can be achieved by administering exogenous glutamine to plants. The decrease in the level of expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of superoxide dismutase increases with the increase in glutamine concentration.

<doc id="63550" wikidata="Q173670" url="?curid=63550" title="Arginine">
<text>Arginine is the amino acid with the formula (H2N)(HN)CN(H)(CH2)3CH(NH2)CO2H. The molecule features a guanidino group appended to a standard amino acid framework. At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (−CO2−) and both the amino and guanidino groups are protonated, resulting in a cation. Only the -arginine (symbol Arg or R) enantiomer is found naturally. Arg residues are common components of proteins. It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG. The guanidine group in arginine is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide. Like all amino acids, it is a white, water-soluble solid.

The one-letter symbol R was assigned to arginine for its phonetic similarity.

==History==
Arginine was first isolated in 1886 from yellow lupin seedlings by the German chemist Ernst Schulze and his assistant Ernst Steiger. He named it from the Greek &quot;árgyros&quot; (ἄργυρος) meaning &quot;silver&quot; due to the silver-white appearance of arginine nitrate crystals. In 1897, Schulze and Ernst Winterstein (1865–1949) determined the structure of arginine. Schulze and Winterstein synthesized arginine from ornithine and cyanamide in 1899, but some doubts about arginine&#x27;s structure lingered until Sørensen&#x27;s synthesis of 1910.

==Sources==
===Production===
It is traditionally obtained by hydrolysis of various cheap sources of protein, such as gelatin. It is obtained commercially by fermentation. In this way, 25-35 g/liter can be produced, using glucose as a carbon source.

===Dietary sources===
Arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Preterm infants are unable to synthesize arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them. Most healthy people do not need to supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and can be synthesized in the body from glutamine via citrulline. Additional, dietary arginine is necessary for otherwise healthy individuals temporarily under physiological stress, for example during recovery from burns, injury or sepsis, or if either of the major sites of arginine biosynthesis, the small intestine and kidneys, have reduced function, because the small bowel does the first step of the synthesizing process and the kidneys do the second.

Arginine is an essential amino acid for birds, as they do not have a urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient protein catabolism produces large quantities of ammonia which need to be processed through the urea cycle, and if not enough arginine is present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation.

Animal sources of arginine include meat, dairy products, and eggs, and plant sources include seeds of all types, for example grains, beans, and nuts.

===Biosynthesis===
Arginine is synthesized from citrulline in the urea cycle by the sequential action of the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase. This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of argininosuccinate that is synthesized, one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents.

The pathways linking arginine, glutamine, and proline are bidirectional. Thus, the net use or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage.

Arginine is made by the body as follows. The epithelial cells of the small intestine produce citrulline, primarily from glutamine and glutamate, which is secreted into the bloodstream which carries it to the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, which extract the citrulline and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the blood. This means that impaired small bowel or renal function can reduce arginine synthesis and thus create a dietary requirement for arginine. For such a person, arginine would become &quot;essential&quot;.

Synthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS). This allows citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline to nitric oxide (citrulline-NO) or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, nitric oxide synthesis can be supported to some extent by citrulline, and not just by arginine. This recycling is not quantitative, however, because citrulline accumulates in nitric oxide producing cells along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of nitric oxide breakdown.

== Function ==
Arginine plays an important role in cell division, wound healing, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. It is a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), making it important in the regulation of blood pressure. Arginine is necessary for T-cells to function in the body, and can lead to their deregulation if depleted.

===Proteins===
Arginine&#x27;s side chain is amphipathic, because at physiological pH it contains a positively charged guanidinium group, which is highly polar, at the end of a hydrophobic aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Because globular proteins have hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic surfaces, arginine is typically found on the outside of the protein, where the hydrophilic head group can interact with the polar environment, for example taking part in hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. For this reason, it is frequently found at the interface between two proteins. The aliphatic part of the side chain sometimes remains below the surface of the protein.

Arginine residues in proteins can be deiminated by PAD enzymes to form citrulline, in a post-translational modification process called citrullination.This is important in fetal development, is part of the normal immune process, as well as the control of gene expression, but is also significant in autoimmune diseases. Another post-translational modification of arginine involves methylation by protein methyltransferases.

===Precursor===
Arginine is the immediate precursor of nitric oxide, an important signaling molecule which can act as a second messenger, as well as an intercellular messenger which regulates vasodilation, and also has functions in the immune system&#x27;s reaction to infection.

Arginine is also a precursor for urea, ornithine, and agmatine; is necessary for the synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine, citrulline, and glutamate). The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as -arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium.

== Structure ==

The amino acid side-chain of arginine consists of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain, the distal end of which is capped by a guanidinium group, which has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 13.8, and is therefore always protonated and positively charged at physiological pH. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized, enabling the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds.

==Research==
===Growth hormone===
Intravenously administered arginine is used in growth hormone stimulation tests because it stimulates the secretion of growth hormone. A review of clinical trials concluded that oral arginine increases growth hormone, but decreases growth hormone secretion, which is normally associated with exercising. However, a more recent trial reported that although oral arginine increased plasma levels of -arginine it did not cause an increase in growth hormone.

===Herpes-Simplex Virus (Cold sores)===
Research from 1964 into amino acid requirements of herpes simplex virus in human cells indicated that &quot;...the lack of arginine or histidine, and possibly the presence of lysine, would interfere markedly with virus synthesis&quot;, but concludes that &quot;no ready explanation is available for any of these observations&quot;.

Further reviews conclude that &quot;lysine&#x27;s efficacy for herpes labialis may lie more in prevention than treatment.&quot; and that &quot;the use of lysine for decreasing the severity or duration of outbreaks&quot; is not supported, while further research is needed. A 2017 study concludes that &quot;clinicians could consider advising patients that there is a theoretical role of lysine supplementation in the prevention of herpes simplex sores but the research evidence is insufficient to back this. Patients with cardiovascular or gallbladder disease should be cautioned and warned of the theoretical risks.&quot;

===High blood pressure===
A meta-analysis showed that -arginine reduces blood pressure with pooled estimates of 5.4 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 2.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure.

Supplementation with -arginine reduces diastolic blood pressure and lengthens pregnancy for women with gestational hypertension, including women with high blood pressure as part of pre-eclampsia. It did not lower systolic blood pressure or improve weight at birth.

===Schizophrenia===
Both liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assays have found that brain tissue of deceased people with schizophrenia shows altered arginine metabolism. Assays also confirmed significantly reduced levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but increased agmatine concentration and glutamate/GABA ratio in the schizophrenia cases. Regression analysis indicated positive correlations between arginase activity and the age of disease onset and between L-ornithine level and the duration of illness. Moreover, cluster analyses revealed that L-arginine and its main metabolites L-citrulline, L-ornithine and agmatine formed distinct groups, which were altered in the schizophrenia group. Despite this, the biological basis of schizophrenia is still poorly understood, a number of factors, such as dopamine hyperfunction, glutamatergic hypofunction, GABAergic deficits, cholinergic system dysfunction, stress vulnerability and neurodevelopmental disruption, have been linked to the aetiology and/or pathophysiology of the disease.

===Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon===
Oral L-arginine has been shown to reverse digital necrosis in Raynaud syndrome.

==Safety and potential drug interactions==
L-arginine is recognized as safe (GRAS-status) at intakes of up to 20 grams per day. L-arginine is found in many foods, such as fish, poultry, and dairy products, and is used as a dietary supplement. It may interact with various prescription drugs and herbal supplements.
