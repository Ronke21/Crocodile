<text>The slash is a slanting line punctuation mark . It is also known as a stroke, a solidus, a forward slash and several other historical or technical names. Once used as the equivalent of the modern period and comma, the slash is now used to represent division and fractions, as a date separator, or to connect alternative terms.

A slash in the reverse direction is known as a backslash.

==History==
Slashes may be found in early writing as a variant form of dashes, vertical strokes, etc. The present use of a slash distinguished from such other marks derives from the medieval European virgule (, which was used as a period, scratch comma, and caesura mark. (The first sense was eventually lost to the low dot and the other two developed separately into the comma and caesura mark ) Its use as a comma became especially widespread in France, where it was also used to mark the continuation of a word onto the next line of a page, a sense later taken on by the hyphen . The Fraktur script used throughout Central Europe in the early modern period used a single slash as a scratch comma and a double slash as a dash. The double slash developed into the double oblique hyphen and double hyphen before being usually simplified into various single dashes.

In the 18th century, the mark was generally known in English as the &quot;oblique&quot;. but particularly the less vertical fraction slash. The variant &quot;oblique stroke&quot; was increasingly shortened to &quot;stroke&quot;, which became the common British name for the character, although printers and publishing professionals often instead referred to it as an &quot;oblique&quot;. In the 19th and early 20th century, it was also widely known as the &quot;shilling mark&quot; or &quot;solidus&quot;, from its use as a notation or abbreviation for the shilling. The name &quot;slash&quot; is a recent development, not appearing in Webster&#x27;s Dictionary until the Third Edition (1961) but has gained wide currency through its use in computing, a context where it is sometimes used in British English in preference to &quot;stroke&quot;. Clarifying terms such as &quot;forward slash&quot; have been coined owing to widespread use of Microsoft&#x27;s DOS and Windows operating systems, which use the backslash extensively.

==Usage==
===Disjunction and conjunction ===

====Connecting alternatives ====

The slash is commonly used in many languages as a shorter substitute for the conjunction &quot;or&quot;, typically with the sense of exclusive or (e.g., Y/N permits yes or no but not both). Its use in this sense is somewhat informal, although it is used in philology to note variants (e.g., &quot;virgula/&quot;) and etymologies (e.g., F. /LL. /L. /PIE. &quot;&quot;).

Such slashes may be used to avoid taking a position in naming disputes. One example is the Assyrian naming dispute, which prompted the US and Swedish censuses to use the respective official designations &quot;Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac&quot; and &quot;Assyrier/Syrianer&quot; for the ethnic group.

In particular, since the late 20th century, the slash is used to permit more gender-neutral language in place of the traditional masculine or plural gender neutrals. In the case of English, this is usually restricted to degendered pronouns such as &quot;he/she&quot; or &quot;s/he&quot;. Most other Indo-European languages include more far-reaching use of grammatical gender. In these, the separate gendered desinences (grammatical suffices) of the words may be given divided by slashes or set off with parentheses. For example, in Spanish, is a son and a is a daughter; some proponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of or when writing for a general audience or addressing a listener of unknown gender. Less commonly, at sign is used instead: . Similarly, in German and some Scandinavian and Baltic languages, refers to any secretary and to an explicitly female secretary; some advocates of gender neutrality support forms such as for general use. This does not always work smoothly, however: problems arise in the case of words like (&#x27;doctor&#x27;) where the explicitly female form is umlauted and words like (&#x27;Chinese person&#x27;) where the explicitly female form loses the terminal &quot;-e&quot;.

====Connecting non-contrasting items ====
The slash is also used as a shorter substitute for the conjunction &quot;and&quot; or inclusive or (i.e., A or B or both), typically in situations where it fills the role of a hyphen or en dash. For example, the &quot;Hemingway/Faulkner generation&quot; might be used to discuss the era of the Lost Generation inclusive of the people around and affected by both Hemingway and Faulkner. This use is sometimes proscribed, as by &quot;New Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot;, the style guide for the Oxford University Press.

====Presenting routes====
The slash, as a form of inclusive or, is also used to punctuate the stages of a route (e.g., Shanghai/Nanjing/Wuhan/Chongqing as stops on a tour of the Yangtze).

==== Introducing topic shifts ====
The word &quot;slash&quot; is also developing as a way to introduce topic shifts or follow-up statements. &quot;Slash&quot; can introduce a follow-up statement, such as, &quot;I really love that hot dog place on Liberty Street. Slash can we go there tomorrow?&quot; It can also indicate a shift to an unrelated topic, as in &quot;JUST SAW ALEX! Slash I just chubbed on oatmeal raisin cookies at north quad and i miss you.&quot; The new usage of &quot;slash&quot; appears most frequently in spoken conversation, though it can also appear in writing.

====In speech====
Sometimes the word &quot;slash&quot; is used in speech as a conjunction to represent the written role of the character (as if a written slash were being read aloud from text), e.g. &quot;bee slash mosquito protection&quot; for a beekeeper&#x27;s net hood, and &quot;There&#x27;s a little bit of nectar slash honey over here, but really it&#x27;s not a lot.&quot; (said by a beekeeper examining in a beehive), and &quot;&quot;Gastornis&quot; slash &quot;Diatryma&quot;&quot; for two supposed genera of prehistoric birds which are now thought to be one genus.

=== Mathematics ===

==== Fractions ====
The slash is used between two numbers to indicate a fraction or ratio. Such formatting developed as a way to write the horizontal fraction bar on a single line of text. It is first attested in England and Mexico in the 18th century. This notation is known as an online, solidus, or shilling fraction. Nowadays fractions, unlike inline division, are often given using smaller numbers, superscript, and subscript (e.g., /). This notation is responsible for the current form of the percent , permille , and permyriad signs, developed from the horizontal form which represented an early modern corruption of an Italian abbreviation of &quot;per cento&quot;.
Unicode provides for a dedicated fraction slash that is distinct from the ASCII solidus . Many typefaces draw this fraction slash (and the division slash) at a less vertical angle than the solidus. The separate encoding permits automatic formatting of the preceding and succeeding digits by glyph substitution with numerator and denominator glyphs, which are in turn distinct from superscript and subscript glyphs (e.g., display of &quot;1, fraction slash, 2&quot; as , and similarly &quot;123, fraction slash, 456&quot; as &quot;123⁄456&quot;). This is supported by an increasing number of environments and computer fonts. Because support is not yet universal, some authors still use Unicode subscripts and superscripts to compose fractions, and many computer fonts design these characters for this purpose. In addition, precomposed fractions of the multiples less than 1 of / for 2 ≤ n ≤ 6 and n = 8 (e.g. and , as well as , , and , are found in the Unicode Number Forms or Latin-1 Supplement blocks.

This notation can also be used when the concept of fractions is extended from numbers to arbitrary rings by the method of localization of a ring.

==== Division ====
The division slash , equivalent to the division sign , may be used between two numbers to indicate division. For example, can also be written as . This use developed from the fraction slash in the late 18th or early 19th century. The formatting was advocated by De Morgan in the mid-19th century.

==== Quotient of set ====

A &quot;quotient of a set&quot; is informally a new set obtained by identifying some elements of the original set. This is denoted as a fraction formula_1 (sometimes even as a built fraction), where the numerator formula_2 is the original set (often equipped with some algebraic structure). What is appropriate as denominator depends on the context.

In the most general case, the denominator is an equivalence relation formula_3 on the original set formula_2, and elements are to be identified in the quotient formula_5 if they are equivalent according to formula_3; this is technically achieved by making formula_5 the set of all equivalence classes of formula_3.

In group theory, the slash is used to mark quotient groups. The general form is formula_9, where formula_10 is the original group and formula_11 is the normal subgroup; this is read &quot;formula_10 mod formula_11&quot;, where &quot;mod&quot; is short for &quot;modulo&quot;. Formally this is a special case of quotient by an equivalence relation, where formula_14 iff formula_15 for some formula_16. Since many algebraic structures (rings, vector spaces, etc.) in particular are groups, the same style of quotients extend also to these, although the denominator may need to satisfy additional closure properties for the quotient to preserve the full algebraic structure of the original (e.g. for the quotient of a ring to be a ring, the denominator must be an ideal).

When the original set is the set of integers formula_17, the denominator may alternatively be just an integer: formula_18. This is an alternative notation for the set formula_19 of integers modulo &quot;n&quot; (needed because formula_19 is also notation for the very different ring of &quot;n&quot;-adic integers). formula_18 is an abbreviation of formula_22 or formula_23, which both are ways of writing the set in question as a quotient of groups.

==== Combining slash ====
Slashes may also be used as a combining character in mathematical formulae. The most important use of this is that combining a slash with a relation negates it, producing e.g. &#x27;not equal&#x27; formula_24 as negation of formula_25 or &#x27;not in&#x27; formula_26 as negation of formula_27; these slashed relation symbols are always implicitly defined in terms of the non-slashed base symbol. The graphical form of the negation slash is mostly the same as for a division slash, except in some cases where that would look odd; the negation formula_28 of formula_29 (divides) and negation formula_30 of formula_3 (various meanings) customarily both have their negations slashes less steep and in particular shorter than the usual one.

The Feynman slash notation is an unrelated use of combining slashes, mostly seen in quantum field theory. This kind of combining slash takes a vector base symbol and converts it to a matrix quantity. Technically this notation is a shorthand for contracting the vector with the Dirac gamma matrices, so formula_32; what one gains is not only a more compact formula, but also not having to allocate a letter as the contracted index.

===Computing===
The slash, sometimes distinguished as &quot;forward slash&quot;, is used in computing in a number of ways, primarily as a separator among levels in a given hierarchy, for example in the path of a filesystem.

====File paths====
The slash is used as the path component separator in many computer operating systems (e.g., Unix&#x27;s ). In Unix and Unix-like systems, such as macOS and Linux, the slash is also used for the volume root directory (e.g., the initial slash in ). Confusion of the slash with the backslash largely arises from the use of the latter as the path component separator in the widely used MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows systems.

====Networking====
The slash is used in a similar fashion in internet URLs (e.g., ). Often this portion of such URLs corresponds with files on a Unix server with the same name, and this is where this convention for internet URLs comes from.

The slash in an IP address (e.g., ) indicates the prefix size in CIDR notation. The number of addresses of a subnet may be calculated as 2, in which the address size is 128 for IPv6 and 32 for IPv4. For example, in IPv4, the prefix size/29 gives: 2 = 2 = 8 addresses.

====Programming====
The slash is used as a division operator in most programming languages while APL uses it for reduction (fold) and compression (filter). The double slash is used by Rexx as a modulo operator, and Python (starting in version 2.2) uses a double slash for division which rounds (using floor) to an integer. In Raku the double slash is used as a &quot;defined-or&quot; alternative to ||. A dot and slash is used in MATLAB and GNU Octave to indicate an element-by-element division of matrices.

Comments that begin with (a slash and an asterisk) and end with were introduced in PL/I and subsequently adopted by SAS, C, Rexx, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, and C#. A double slash is also used by C99, C++, C#, PHP, Java, Swift, Pascal and JavaScript to start a single line comment.

In SGML and derived languages such as HTML and XML, a slash is used in closing tags. For example, in HTML, begins a section of text and closes it. In XHTML, slashes are also necessary for &quot;self-closing&quot; elements such as the newline command where HTML has simply .

In a style originating in the Digital Equipment Corporation line of operating systems (OS/8, RT-11, TOPS-10, et cetera), Windows, DOS, some CP/M programs, OpenVMS, and OS/2 all use the slash to indicate command-line options. For example, the command is understood as using the command dir (&quot;directory&quot;) with the &quot;wide&quot; option. No space is required between the command and the switch; this was the reason for the choice to use backslashes as the path separator since one would otherwise be unable to run a program in a different directory.

Slashes are used as the standard delimiters for regular expressions, although other characters can be used instead.

IBM JCL uses a double slash to start each line in a batch job stream except for /* and /&amp;.

====Programs====
IRC and many in-game chat clients use the slash to mark commands, such as joining and leaving a chat room or sending private messages. For example, in IRC, is a command to join the channel &quot;services&quot; and is a command to format the following message as though it were an action instead of a spoken message. In &quot;Minecraft&quot;″s chat function, the slash is used for executing console and plugin commands. In &quot;Second Life&quot;″s chat function, the slash is used to select the &quot;communications channel&quot;, allowing users to direct commands to virtual objects &quot;listening&quot; on different channels. For example, if a virtual house&#x27;s lights were set to use channel 42, the command &quot;/42 on&quot; would turn them on. In Discord, slash commands are used to send special messages and execute commands, like sending a shrug emoji (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) or a table flip emoji ((╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻), or changing one&#x27;s nickname using &quot;/nick&quot;. Slash commands can also be used to use Discord bots.

The Gedcom standard for exchanging computerized genealogical data uses slashes to delimit surnames; an example would be Bill /Smith/ Jr. Slashes around surnames are also used in Personal Ancestral File.

===Electronics===
A leading slash is one of several common conventions for indicating an active-low digital signal, which performs the named function when at a low voltage level. For example, dynamic random-access memory has active-low Chip Select, Row Address Strobe and Column Address Strobe signals, commonly written , , and . This extends to signals which select between two options, such as &quot;&quot;, which indicates that the function is &quot;read&quot; when high and &quot;write&quot; when low. (Sometimes written as for greater clarity.

===Currency===
The slash (as the &quot;shilling mark&quot; or &quot;solidus&quot;) was an abbreviation for the shilling, a former coin of the United Kingdom and its former colonies. Before the decimalisation of currency in Britain, its currency abbreviations (collectively £sd) represented their Latin names, derived from a medieval French modification of the late Roman libra, solidus, and denarius. Thus, one penny less than two pounds was written or During the period when English orthography included the long s, or &quot;&quot;, (abbreviating &quot;shilling&quot;) the ſ came to be written as a single slash. The d. might be omitted, and &quot;2ſ6&quot; (&quot;two shillings and sixpence&quot;) became simplified as 2/6. Amounts in full pounds, shillings and pence could be written in many different ways, for example: £1 9s 6d, £1.9.6, £1-9-6, and even £1/9/6d (with a slash used &quot;also&quot; to separate pounds and shillings). The same style was also used under the British Raj and early independent India for the predecimalization rupee/anna/pie system.

In five East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and the &quot;de facto&quot; country of Somaliland), where the national currencies are denominated in shillings, the decimal separator is a slash mark (e.g., ). Where the minor unit is zero, an equals sign is used (e.g., 5/=).

In foreign exchange, a slash is used to denote a currency pair, for example the USD/EUR rate is the number of euros per US dollar.

===Dates ===
Slashes are a common calendar date separator used across many countries and by some standards such as the Common Log Format used by web servers. Depending on context, it may be in the form Day/Month/Year, Month/Day/Year, or Year/Month/Day. If only two elements are present, they typically denote a day and month in some order. For example, 9/11 is a common American way of writing the date 11 September; Britons write this as 11/9. Owing to the ambiguity across cultures, the practice of using only two elements to denote a date is sometimes proscribed.

Because of the world&#x27;s many varying conventional date and time formats, ISO 8601 advocates the use of a Year-Month-Day system separated by hyphens (e.g., Victory in Europe Day occurred on 1945-05-08). In the ISO 8601 system, slashes represent date ranges: &quot;1939/1945&quot; represents what is more commonly written in Anglophone countries as &quot;1939–1945&quot;. The autumn term of a northern-hemisphere school year might be marked &quot;2010-09-01/12-22&quot;.

In English, a range marked by a slash often has a separate meaning from one marked by a dash or hyphen. &quot;24/25 December&quot; would mark the time shared by both days (i.e., the night from Christmas Eve to Christmas morning) rather than the time made up by both days together, which would be written &quot;24–25 December&quot;. Similarly, a historical reference to &quot;1066/67&quot; might imply an event occurred during the winter of late 1066 and early 1067, whereas a reference to 1066–67 would cover the entirety of both years. The usage was particularly common in British English during World War II, where such slash dates were used for night-bombing air raids. It is also used by some police forces in the United States.

===Numbering===
The slash is used in numbering to note totals. For example, &quot;page 17/35&quot; indicates that the relevant passage is on the 17th page of a 35-page document. Similarly, the marking &quot;#333/500&quot; on a product indicates it is the 333rd out of 500 identical products or out of a batch of 500 such products. For scores on schoolwork, in games, and so on, &quot;85/100&quot; indicates 85 points were attained out of a possible 100.

Slashes are also sometimes used to mark ranges in numbers that already include hyphens or dashes. One example is the ISO treatment of dating. Another is the US Air Force&#x27;s treatment of aircraft serial numbers, which are normally written to note the fiscal year and aircraft number. For example, &quot;85-1000&quot; notes the thousandth aircraft ordered in fiscal year 1985. To indicate the next fifty subsequent aircraft, a slash is used in place of a hyphen or dash: &quot;85-1001/1050&quot;.

===Linguistic transcription===

A pair of slashes (as &quot;slants&quot;) are used in the transcription of speech to enclose pronunciations (i.e., phonetic transcriptions). For example, the IPA transcription of the English pronunciation of &quot;solidus&quot; is written . Properly, slashes mark broad or phonemic transcriptions, whereas narrow, allophonic transcriptions are enclosed by square brackets. For example, the word &quot;little&quot; may be broadly rendered as but a careful transcription of the velarization of the second L would be written .

In sociolinguistics, a double or triple slash may also be used in the transcription of a traditional sociolinguistic interview or in other type of linguistic elicitation to represent simultaneous speech, interruptions, and certain types of speech disfluencies.

Single and double slashes are often used as typographic substitutes for the click letters ǀ, ǁ.

A diaphonemic transcription may be marked in several ways, e.g. with a pair of slash marks ().

===Poetry===
The slash is used in various scansion notations for representing the metrical pattern of a line of verse, typically to indicate a stressed syllable.

===Line breaks===
The slash (as a &quot;virgule&quot;) offset by spaces to either side is used to mark line breaks when transcribing text from a multi-line format into a single-line one. It is particularly common in quoting poetry, song lyrics, and dramatic scripts, formats where omitting the line breaks risks losing meaningful context. For example, here is a part of Hamlet&#x27;s soliloquy:

If someone wanted to quote the above soliloquy in a prose paragraph, it is standard to mark the line breaks as follows: &quot;To be, or not to be, that is the Whether &#x27;tis nobler in the mind to The slings and arrows of outrageous Or to take arms against a sea of And by opposing end them...&quot; Less often, virgules are used in marking paragraph breaks when quoting a prose passage. Some style guides, such as &quot;New Hart&#x27;s&quot;, prefer to use a pipe in place of the slash to mark these line and paragraph breaks.

The virgule may be thinner than a standard slash when typeset. In computing contexts, it may be necessary to use a non-breaking space before the virgule to prevent it from being widowed on the next line.

===Abbreviation ===
The slash has become standard in several abbreviations. Generally, it is used to mark two-letter initialisms such as A/C (short for &quot;air conditioner&quot;), w/o (&quot;without&quot;), b/w (&quot;black and white&quot; or, less often, &quot;between&quot;), w/e (&quot;whatever&quot; or, less often, &quot;weekend&quot; or &quot;week ending&quot;), i/o (&quot;input/output&quot;), r/w (&quot;read/write&quot;), and n/a (&quot;not applicable&quot;). Other initialisms employing the slash include w/ (&quot;with&quot;) and w/r/t (&quot;with regard to&quot;). Such slashed abbreviations are somewhat more common in British English and were more common around the Second World War (as with &quot;S/E&quot; to mean &quot;single-engined&quot;). The abbreviation 24/7 (denoting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) describes a business that is always open or unceasing activity.

The slash in derived units such as m/s (meters per second) is not an abbreviation slash, but a straight division. It is however in that position read as &#x27;per&#x27; rather than e.g. &#x27;over&#x27;, which can be seen as analogous to units whose symbols are pure abbreviations such as mph (miles per hour), although in abbreviations &#x27;per&#x27; is &#x27;p&#x27; or dropped entirely (psi, pounds per square inch) rather than a slash.

In the US government, the names of offices within various departments are abbreviated using slashes, starting with the larger office and following with its subdivisions. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s Office of Commercial Space Transportation is formally abbreviated FAA/AST.

===Proofreading===
The slash or vertical bar (as a &quot;separatrix&quot;) is used in proofreading to mark the end of margin notes or to separate margin notes from one another. The slash is also sometimes used in various proofreading initialisms, such as l/c and u/c for changes to lower and upper case, respectively.

===Typist===
In formal business correspondence, when a letter is typed by someone other than the person responsible for its contents, it is standard to add a suffix with the initials of the author (in upper-case), and typist (in lower-case) after the signature block, separated by a slash. For example, a letter typed by D.E. at the direction of A.B.C. would include the line &quot;ABC/de&quot;.

===Fiction===
The slash is used in fan fiction to mark the romantic pairing a piece will focus upon (e.g., a K/S denoted a &quot;Star Trek&quot; story would focus on a sexual relationship between Kirk and Spock), a usage which developed in the 1970s from the earlier friendship pairings marked by ampersands (e.g., K&amp;S). The genre as a whole is now known as slash fiction. Because it is more generally associated with homosexual male relationships, lesbian slash fiction is sometimes distinguished as femslash. In situations where other pairings occur, the genres may be distinguished as m/m, f/f, and so on.

===Libraries===
The slash is used under the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules to separate the title of a work from its statement of responsibility (i.e., the listing of its author, director, etc.). Like a line break, this slash is surrounded by a single space on either side. For example:

* Gone with the Wind / by Margaret Mitchell.
* Star Trek II. The Wrath of Khan [videorecording] / Paramount Pictures.

The format is used in both card catalogs and online records.

===Addresses===
The slash is sometimes used as an abbreviation for building numbers. For example, in some contexts, 8/A Evergreen Gardens specifies Apartment 8 in Building A of the residential complex Evergreen Gardens. In the United States, however, such an address refers to the first division of Apartment 8 and is simply a variant of Apartment 8A or 8-A. Similarly in the United Kingdom, an address such as 12/2 Anywhere Road means flat (or apartment) 2 in the building numbered 12 on Anywhere Road.

The slash is also used in the United States in the postal abbreviation for &quot;care of.&quot; For example, Judy Smith c/o Bob Smith could be used when Bob Smith is receiving mail on Judy&#x27;s behalf. Typically, this would be used in a situation where someone is either out of town, in an institution or hotel, or temporarily staying at another&#x27;s address.

In Spanish address writings, &quot;c/&quot; is used as the abbreviation of &quot;calle&quot; (or &quot;carrer&quot; in Catalan) meaning &quot;street&quot;.

===Music===
Slashes are used in musical notation as an alternative to writing out specific notes where it is easier to read than traditional notation or where the player can improvise. They are commonly used to indicate chords either in place of or in combination with traditional notation, notably in the form of slash chords. For drummers, they find use as an indication to continue with a previously indicated style.

===Sports===
A slash is used to mark a spare (knocking down all ten pins in two throws) when scoring ten-pin and duckpin bowling.

===Text messaging ===
In online messaging, a slash might be used to imitate the formatting of a chat command (e.g., writing &quot;/fliptable&quot; as though there were such a command) or the closing tags of languages such as HTML (e.g., writing &quot;/endrant&quot; to end a diatribe or &quot;/s&quot; to mark the preceding text as sarcastic). A pair of slashes is sometimes used as a way to mark italic text, where no special formatting is available (e.g., /italics/).

=== Before an e-signature ===
In legal writing, especially in a pleading, attorneys often sign their name with an &quot;s&quot; that is either enclosed by two slashes or followed by a single slash and preceding the attorney&#x27;s name. An example would be the following:

===As a letter ===
The Iraqw language of Tanzania uses the slash as a letter, representing the voiced pharyngeal fricative, as in /ameeni, &quot;woman&quot;.

==Spacing==
There are usually no spaces either before or after a slash. According to &quot;New Hart&#x27;s Rules: The Oxford Style Guide&quot;, a slash is usually written without spacing on either side when it connects single words, letters or symbols. Exceptions are in representing the start of a new line when quoting verse, or a new paragraph when quoting prose. &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; also allows spaces when either of the separated items is a compound that itself includes a space: &quot;Our New Zealand / Western Australia trip&quot;. (Compare use of an en dash used to separate such compounds.) &quot;The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing&quot; prescribes: &quot;No space before or after an oblique when used between individual words, letters or symbols; one space before and after the oblique when used between longer groups which contain internal spacing&quot;, giving the examples &quot;n/a&quot; and &quot;Language and Society / &quot;Langue et société&quot;&quot;.

According to &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, when typesetting a URL or computer path, line breaks should occur before a slash but not in the text between two slashes.

==Encoding==

As a very common character, the slash (as &quot;slant&quot;) was originally encoded in ASCII with the decimal code 47 or 0x2F. The same value was used in Unicode, which calls it &quot;solidus&quot; and also adds some more characters:

* (ASCII &quot;slant&quot; or &quot;slash&quot;)
* (for strikethrough)
* (for strikethrough)
* 
* 
* (fullwidth version of solidus)

In XML and HTML, the slash can also be represented with the character entity   or the numeric character reference   or  .

==Alternative names==

The slash may also be read out as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;and/or&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, or &quot;cum&quot; in some compounds separated by a slash; &quot;over&quot; or &quot;out of&quot; in fractions, division, and numbering; and &quot;per&quot; or &quot;a(n)&quot; in derived units (as km/h) and prices (as $~/kg), where the division slash stands for &quot;each&quot;.

* Feynman slash notation in physics, which employs slash-like strikethroughs
* Inequality sign, an equals sign with a slash-like strikethrough

<text>An apostrophe is an exclamatory figure of speech. It occurs when a speaker breaks off from addressing the audience (e.g., in a play) and directs speech to a third party such as an opposing litigant or some other individual, sometimes absent from the scene. Often the addressee is a personified abstract quality or inanimate object. In dramatic works and poetry written in or translated into English, such a figure of speech is often introduced by the vocative exclamation, &quot;O&quot;. Poets may apostrophize a beloved, the Muses, God or gods, love, time, or any other entity that can&#x27;t respond in reality.

* &quot;O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?&quot; 1 Corinthians 15:55, Paul the Apostle
* &quot;O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, / That I am meek and gentle with these butchers! / Thou art the ruins of the noblest man / That ever lived in the tide of times.&quot; William Shakespeare, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, act 3, scene 1
* &quot;O happy dagger! This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.&quot; &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, act 5, scene 3, 169–170.
* &quot;To what green altar, O mysterious priest, / Lead&#x27;st thou that heifer lowing at the skies, / And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?&quot; John Keats, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;
* &quot;O eloquent, just, and mighty Death!&quot; Sir Walter Raleigh, &quot;A Historie of the World&quot;
* &quot;Thou hast the keys of Paradise, oh just, subtle, and mighty opium!&quot; Thomas De Quincey, &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot;
* &quot;Roll on, thou dark and deep blue Ocean – roll!&quot; Lord Byron, &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;

<text>A mycorrhiza (; , mycorrhiza, or mycorrhizas) is a symbiotic association between a fungus and a plant. The term mycorrhiza refers to the role of the fungus in the plant&#x27;s rhizosphere, the plant root system and its surroundings. Mycorrhizae play important roles in plant nutrition, soil biology, and soil chemistry.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant&#x27;s root tissues, either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, or extracellularly as in ectomycorrhizal fungi. The association is normally mutualistic. In particular species, or in particular circumstances, mycorrhizae may have a parasitic association with host plants.

== Definition ==

A mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a green plant and a fungus. The plant makes organic molecules by photosynthesis and supplies them to the fungus in the form of sugars or lipids, while the fungus supplies the plant with water and mineral nutrients, such as phosphorus, taken from the soil. Mycorrhizas are located in the roots of vascular plants, but mycorrhiza-like associations also occur in bryophytes and there is fossil evidence that early land plants that lacked roots formed arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. Most plant species form mycorrhizal associations, though some families like Brassicaceae and Chenopodiaceae cannot. Different forms for the association are detailed in the next section. The most common is the arbuscular type that is present in 70% of plant species, including many crop plants such as cereals and legumes.

== Evolution ==

Fossil and genetic evidence indicate that mycorrhizae are ancient, potentially as old as the terrestrialization of plants. Genetic evidence indicates that all land plants share a single common ancestor, which appears to have quickly adopted mycorrhizal symbiosis, and research suggests that proto-mycorrhizal fungi were a key factor enabling plant terrestrialization. The 400 million year old Rhynie chert contains an assemblage of fossil plants preserved in sufficient detail that arbuscular mycorrhizae have been observed in the stems of &quot;Aglaophyton major&quot;, giving a lower bound for how late mycorrhizal symbiosis may have developed. Ectomycorrhizae developed substantially later, during the Jurassic period, while most other modern mycorrhizal families, including orchid and ericoid mycorrhizae, date to the period of angiosperm radiation in the Cretaceous period. There is genetic evidence that the symbiosis between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria is an extension of mycorrhizal symbiosis. The modern distribution of mycorrhizal fungi appears to reflect an increasing complexity and competition in root morphology associated with the dominance of angiosperms in the Cenozoic Era, characterized by complex ecological dynamics between species.

== Types==
The mycorrhizal lifestyle has independently convergently evolved multiple times in the history of Earth. There are multiple ways to categorize mycorrhizal symbiosis. One major categorization is the division between &quot;ectomycorrhizas&quot; and &quot;endomycorrhizas&quot;. The two types are differentiated by the fact that the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root, while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and the cell membrane.

===Similar symbiotic relationships===
Some forms of plant-fungal symbiosis are similar to mycorrhizae, but considered distinct. One example is fungal endophytes. Endophytes are defined as organisms that can live within plant cells without causing harm to the plant. They are distinguishable from mycorrhizal fungi by the absence of nutrient-transferring structures for bringing in nutrients from outside the plant. Some lineages of mycorrhizal fungi may have evolved from endophytes into mycorrhizal fungi, and some fungi can live as mycorrhizae or as endophytes.

===Ectomycorrhiza===


Ectomycorrhizae are distinct in that they do not penetrate into plant cells, but instead form a structure called a Hartig net that penetrates between cells. Ectomycorrhizas consist of a hyphal sheath, or mantle, covering the root tip and the Hartig net of hyphae surrounding the plant cells within the root cortex. In some cases the hyphae may also penetrate the plant cells, in which case the mycorrhiza is called an endomycorrhiza. Outside the root, ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium forms an extensive network within the soil and leaf litter. Other forms of mycorrhizae, including arbuscular, ericoid, arbutoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizas, are considered endomycorrhizae.

Ectomycorrhizas, or EcM, are symbiotic associations between the roots of around 10% of plant families, mostly woody plants including the birch, dipterocarp, eucalyptus, oak, pine, and rose families, orchids, and fungi belonging to the Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota. Ectomycorrhizae associate with relatively few plant species, only about 2% of plant species on Earth, but the species they associate with are mostly trees and woody plants that are highly dominant in their ecosystems, meaning plants in ectomycorrhizal relationships make up a large proportion of plant biomass. Some EcM fungi, such as many &quot;Leccinum&quot; and &quot;Suillus&quot;, are symbiotic with only one particular genus of plant, while other fungi, such as the &quot;Amanita&quot;, are generalists that form mycorrhizas with many different plants. An individual tree may have 15 or more different fungal EcM partners at one time. While the diversity of plants involved in EcM is low, the diversity of fungi involved in EcM is high. Thousands of ectomycorrhizal fungal species exist, hosted in over 200 genera. A recent study has conservatively estimated global ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness at approximately 7750 species, although, on the basis of estimates of knowns and unknowns in macromycete diversity, a final estimate of ECM species richness would probably be between 20,000 and 25,000. Ectomycorrhizal fungi evolved independently from saprotrophic ancestors many times in the group&#x27;s history.

Nutrients can be shown to move between different plants through the fungal network. Carbon has been shown to move from paper birch seedlings into adjacent Douglas-fir seedlings, although not conclusively through a common mycorrhizal network, thereby promoting succession in ecosystems. The ectomycorrhizal fungus &quot;Laccaria bicolor&quot; has been found to lure and kill springtails to obtain nitrogen, some of which may then be transferred to the mycorrhizal host plant. In a study by Klironomos and Hart, Eastern White Pine inoculated with &quot;L. bicolor&quot; was able to derive up to 25% of its nitrogen from springtails. When compared with non-mycorrhizal fine roots, ectomycorrhizae may contain very high concentrations of trace elements, including toxic metals (cadmium, silver) or chlorine.

The first genomic sequence for a representative of symbiotic fungi, the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete &quot;L. bicolor&quot;, was published in 2008. An expansion of several multigene families occurred in this fungus, suggesting that adaptation to symbiosis proceeded by gene duplication. Within lineage-specific genes those coding for symbiosis-regulated secreted proteins showed an up-regulated expression in ectomycorrhizal root tips suggesting a role in the partner communication. &quot;L. bicolor&quot; is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells during the root colonisation. By contrast, &quot;L. bicolor&quot; possesses expanded multigene families associated with hydrolysis of bacterial and microfauna polysaccharides and proteins. This genome analysis revealed the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots. Since then, the genomes of many other ectomycorrhizal fungal species have been sequenced further expanding the study of gene families and evolution in these organisms.

====Arbutoid mycorrhiza====

This type of mycorrhiza involves plants of the Ericaceae subfamily Arbutoideae. It is however different from ericoid mycorrhiza and resembles ectomycorrhiza, both functionally and in terms of the fungi involved. It differs from ectomycorrhiza in that some hyphae actually penetrate into the root cells, making this type of mycorrhiza an &quot;ectendomycorrhiza&quot;.

===Arbuscular mycorrhiza===

Arbuscular mycorrhizas, (formerly known as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas), have hyphae that penetrate plant cells, producing branching, tree-like structures called arbuscules within the plant cells for nutrient exchange. Often, balloon-like storage structures, termed vesicles, are also produced. In this interaction, fungal hyphae do not in fact penetrate the protoplast (i.e. the interior of the cell), but invaginate the cell membrane, creating a so-called peri-arbuscular membrane. The structure of the arbuscules greatly increases the contact surface area between the hypha and the host cell cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between them. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are obligate biotrophs, meaning that they depend upon the plant host for both growth and reproduction; they have lost the ability to sustain themselves by decomposing dead plant material. Twenty percent of the photosynthetic products made by the plant host are consumed by the fungi, the transfer of carbon from the terrestrial host plant is then exchanged by equal amounts of phosphate from the fungi to the plant host.

Contrasting with the pattern seen in ectomycorrhizae, the species diversity of AMFs is very low, but the diversity of plant hosts is very high; an estimated 78% of all plant species associate with AMFs. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are formed only by fungi in the division Glomeromycota. Fossil evidence and DNA sequence analysis suggest that this mutualism appeared 400-460 million years ago, when the first plants were colonizing land. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are found in 85% of all plant families, and occur in many crop species. The hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce the glycoprotein glomalin, which may be one of the major stores of carbon in the soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have (possibly) been asexual for many millions of years and, unusually, individuals can contain many genetically different nuclei (a phenomenon called heterokaryosis).

===Mucoromycotina fine root endophytes===
Mycorrhizal fungi belonging to Mucoromycotina, known as “fine root endophytes&quot; (MFREs), were mistakenly identified as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi until recently. While similar to AMF, MFREs are from subphylum Mucoromycotina instead of Glomeromycotina. Their morphology when colonizing a plant root is very similar to AMF, but they form fine textured hyphae. Effects of MFREs may have been mistakenly attributed to AMFs due to confusion between the two, complicated by the fact that AMFs and MFREs often colonize the same hosts simultaneously. Unlike AMFs, they appear capable of surviving without a host. This group of mycorrhizal fungi is little understood, but appears to prefer wet, acidic soils and forms symbiotic relationships with liverworts, hornworts, lycophytes, and angiosperms.

===Ericoid mycorrhiza===

Ericoid mycorrhizae, or ErMs, involve only plants in Ericales and are the most recently evolved of the major mycorrhizal relationships. Plants that form ericoid mycorrhizae are mostly woody understory shrubs; hosts include blueberries, bilberries, cranberries, mountain laurels, rhododendrons, heather, neinei, and giant grass tree. ErMs are most common in boreal forests, but are found in two-thirds of all forests on Earth. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi belong to several different lineages of fungi. Some species can live as endophytes entirely within plant cells even within plants outside the Ericales, or live independently as saprotrophs that decompose dead organic matter. This ability to switch between multiple lifestyle types makes ericoid mycorrhizal fungi very adaptable.

Plants that participate in these symbioses have specialized roots with no root hairs, which are covered with a layer of epidermal cells that the fungus penetrates into and completely occupies. The fungi have a simple intraradical (growth in cells) phase, consisting of dense coils of hyphae in the outermost layer of root cells. There is no periradical phase and the extraradical phase consists of sparse hyphae that don&#x27;t extend very far into the surrounding soil. They might form sporocarps (probably in the form of small cups), but their reproductive biology is poorly understood.

Plants participating in ericoid mycorrhizal symbioses are found in acidic, nutrient-poor conditions. Whereas AMFs have lost their saprotrophic capabilities, and EcM fungi have significant variation in their ability to produce enzymes needed for a saprotrophic lifestyle, fungi involved in ErMs have fully retained the ability to decompose plant material for sustenance. Some ericoid mycorrhizal fungi have actually expanded their repertoire of enzymes for breaking down organic matter. They can extract nitrogen from cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, and chitin. This would increase the benefit they can provide to their plant symbiotic partners.

===Orchid mycorrhiza===

All orchids are myco-heterotrophic at some stage during their lifecycle, meaning that they can survive only if they form orchid mycorrhizae. Orchid seeds are so small that they contain no nutrition to sustain the germinating seedling, and instead must gain the energy to grow from their fungal symbiont. The OM relationship is asymmetric; the plant seems to benefit more than the fungus, and some orchids are entirely mycoheterotrophic, lacking chlorophyll for photosynthesis. It is actually unknown whether fully autotrophic orchids that do not receive some of their carbon from fungi exist or not. Like fungi that form ErMs, OM fungi can sometimes live as endophytes or as independent saprotrophs. In the OM symbiosis, hyphae penetrate into the root cells and form pelotons (coils) for nutrient exchange.

===Monotropoid mycorrhiza===

This type of mycorrhiza occurs in the subfamily Monotropoideae of the Ericaceae, as well as several genera in the Orchidaceae. These plants are heterotrophic or mixotrophic and derive their carbon from the fungus partner. This is thus a non-mutualistic, parasitic type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.

==Function==

Mycorrhizal fungi form a mutualistic relationship with the roots of most plant species. In such a relationship, both the plants themselves and those parts of the roots that host the fungi, are said to be mycorrhizal. Relatively few of the mycorrhizal relationships between plant species and fungi have been examined to date, but 95% of the plant families investigated are predominantly mycorrhizal either in the sense that most of their species associate beneficially with mycorrhizae, or are absolutely dependent on mycorrhizae. The Orchidaceae are notorious as a family in which the absence of the correct mycorrhizae is fatal even to germinating seeds.

Recent research into ectomycorrhizal plants in boreal forests has indicated that mycorrhizal fungi and plants have a relationship that may be more complex than simply mutualistic. This relationship was noted when mycorrhizal fungi were unexpectedly found to be hoarding nitrogen from plant roots in times of nitrogen scarcity. Researchers argue that some mycorrhizae distribute nutrients based upon the environment with surrounding plants and other mycorrhizae. They go on to explain how this updated model could explain why mycorrhizae do not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation, and why plants can switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines. It has also been suggested that evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships can explain much more variation in the strength of mycorrhizal mutualisms than ecological factors.

===Formation===
To successfully engage in mutualistic symbiotic relationships with other organisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi and any of the thousands of microbes that colonize plants, plants must discriminate between mutualists and pathogens, allowing the mutualists to colonize while activating an immune response towards the pathogens. Plant genomes code for potentially hundreds of receptors for detecting chemical signals from other organisms. Plants dynamically adjust their symbiotic and immune responses, changing their interactions with their symbionts in response to feedbacks detected by the plant. In plants, the mycorrhizal symbiosis is regulated by the common symbiosis signaling pathway (CSSP), a set of genes involved in initiating and maintaining colonization by endosymbiotic fungi and other endosymbionts such as Rhizobia in legumes. The CSSP has origins predating the colonization of land by plants, demonstrating that the co-evolution of plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is over 500 million years old. In arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, the presence of strigolactones, a plant hormone, secreted from roots induces fungal spores in the soil to germinate, stimulates their metabolism, growth and branching, and prompts the fungi to release chemical signals the plant can detect. Once the plant and fungus recognize one another as suitable symbionts, the plant activates the common symbiotic signaling pathway, which causes changes in the root tissues that enable the fungus to colonize. 

Experiments with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have identified numerous chemical compounds to be involved in the &quot;chemical dialog&quot; that occurs between the prospective symbionts before symbiosis is begun. In plants, almost all plant hormones play a role in initiating or regulating AMF symbiosis, and other chemical compounds are also suspected to have a signaling function. While the signals emitted by the fungi are less understood, it has been shown that chitinaceous molecules known as Myc factors are essential for the formation of arbuscular mycorrhizae. Signals from plants are detected by LysM-containing receptor-like kinases, or LysM-RLKs. AMF genomes also code for potentially hundreds of effector proteins, of which only a few have a proven effect on mycorrhizal symbiosis, but many others likely have a function in communication with plant hosts as well.

Many factors are involved in the initiation of mycorrhizal symbiosis, but particularly influential is the plant&#x27;s need for phosphorus. Experiments involving rice plants with a mutation disabling their ability to detect P starvation show that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi detection, recruitment and colonization is prompted when the plant detects that it is starved of phosphorus. Nitrogen starvation also plays a role in initiating AMF symbiosis.

===Mechanisms===

The mechanisms by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include some that are physical and some that are chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or root hair, and thus can explore soil material that roots and root hairs cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi differs from that of plants. For example, they may secrete organic acids that dissolve or chelate many ions, or release them from minerals by ion exchange. Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.

===Sugar-water/mineral exchange===

The mycorrhizal mutualistic association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose. The carbohydrates are translocated from their source (usually leaves) to root tissue and on to the plant&#x27;s fungal partners. In return, the plant gains the benefits of the mycelium&#x27;s higher absorptive capacity for water and mineral nutrients, partly because of the large surface area of fungal hyphae, which are much longer and finer than plant root hairs, and partly because some such fungi can mobilize soil minerals unavailable to the plants&#x27; roots. The effect is thus to improve the plant&#x27;s mineral absorption capabilities.

Unaided plant roots may be unable to take up nutrients that are chemically or physically immobilised; examples include phosphate ions and micronutrients such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high clay content, or soils with a strongly basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize. Thus, many plants are able to obtain phosphate without using soil as a source. Another form of immobilisation is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some dystrophic forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake. &quot;Inga alley cropping&quot;, an agroforestry technique proposed as an alternative to slash and burn rainforest destruction, relies upon mycorrhiza within the root system of species of &quot;Inga&quot; to prevent the rain from washing phosphorus out of the soil.

In some more complex relationships, mycorrhizal fungi do not just collect immobilised soil nutrients, but connect individual plants together by mycorrhizal networks that transport water, carbon, and other nutrients directly from plant to plant through underground hyphal networks.

&quot;Suillus tomentosus&quot;, a basidiomycete fungus, produces specialized structures known as tuberculate ectomycorrhizae with its plant host lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot; var. &quot;latifolia&quot;). These structures have been shown to host nitrogen fixing bacteria which contribute a significant amount of nitrogen and allow the pines to colonize nutrient-poor sites.
===Disease, drought and salinity resistance and its correlation to mycorrhizae===

Mycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne pathogens. These associations have been found to assist in plant defense both above and belowground. Mycorrhizas have been found to excrete enzymes that are toxic to soil borne organisms such as nematodes. More recent studies have shown that mycorrhizal associations result in a priming effect of plants that essentially acts as a primary immune response. When this association is formed a defense response is activated similarly to the response that occurs when the plant is under attack. As a result of this inoculation, defense responses are stronger in plants with mycorrhizal associations.
Ecosystem services provided by mycorrhizal fungi may depend on the soil microbiome. Furthermore, mycorrhizal fungi was significantly correlated with soil physical variable, but only with water level and not with aggregate stability and can lead also to more resistant to the effects of drought. Moreover, the significance of mycorrhizal fungi also includes alleviation of salt stress and its beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. Although salinity can negatively affect mycorrhizal fungi, many reports show improved growth and performance of mycorrhizal plants under salt stress conditions.

===Resistance to insects===

Plants connected by mycorrhizal fungi in mycorrhizal networks can use these underground connections to communicate warning signals. For example, when a host plant is attacked by an aphid, the plant signals surrounding connected plants of its condition. Both the host plant and those connected to it release volatile organic compounds that repel aphids and attract parasitoid wasps, predators of aphids. This assists the mycorrhizal fungi by conserving its food supply.

===Colonization of barren soil===
Plants grown in sterile soils and growth media often perform poorly without the addition of spores or hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi to colonise the plant roots and aid in the uptake of soil mineral nutrients. The absence of mycorrhizal fungi can also slow plant growth in early succession or on degraded landscapes. The introduction of alien mycorrhizal plants to nutrient-deficient ecosystems puts indigenous non-mycorrhizal plants at a competitive disadvantage. This aptitude to colonize barren soil is defined by the category Oligotroph.

===Resistance to toxicity===

Fungi have a protective role for plants rooted in soils with high metal concentrations, such as acidic and contaminated soils. Pine trees inoculated with &quot;Pisolithus tinctorius&quot; planted in several contaminated sites displayed high tolerance to the prevailing contaminant, survivorship and growth. One study discovered the existence of &quot;Suillus luteus&quot; strains with varying tolerance of zinc. Another study discovered that zinc-tolerant strains of &quot;Suillus bovinus&quot; conferred resistance to plants of &quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;. This was probably due to binding of the metal to the extramatricial mycelium of the fungus, without affecting the exchange of beneficial substances.

==Occurrence of mycorrhizal associations==

Mycorrhizas are present in 92% of plant families studied (80% of species), with arbuscular mycorrhizas being the ancestral and predominant form, and the most prevalent symbiotic association found in the plant kingdom. The structure of arbuscular mycorrhizas has been highly conserved since their first appearance in the fossil record, with both the development of ectomycorrhizas and the loss of mycorrhizas, evolving convergently on multiple occasions.

Associations of fungi with the roots of plants have been known since at least the mid-19th century. However, early observers simply recorded the fact without investigating the relationships between the two organisms. This symbiosis was studied and described by Franciszek Kamieński in 1879–1882.

== Climate change ==

CO2 released by human activities is causing climate change and possible damage to mycorrhizae, but the direct effect of an increase in the gas should be to benefit plants and mycorrhizae. In Arctic regions, nitrogen and water are harder for plants to obtain, making mycorrhizae crucial to plant growth. Since mycorrhizae tend to do better in cooler temperatures, warming could be detrimental to them. Gases such as SO2, NO-x, and O3 produced by human activity may harm mycorrhizae, causing reduction in &quot;propagules, the colonization of roots, degradation in connections between trees, reduction in the mycorrhizal incidence in trees, and reduction in the enzyme activity of ectomycorrhizal roots.&quot;

A company in Israel, Groundwork BioAg, has discovered a method of using mycorrhizal fungi to increase agricultural crops while sequestering greenhouse gases and eliminating CO2 from the atmosphere.

== Conservation and mapping ==
In 2021, the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks was launched. SPUN is a science-based initiative to map and protect the mycorrhizal networks regulating Earth’s climate and ecosystems. Its stated goals are mapping, protecting, and harnessing mycorrhizal fungi.

<text>John Holbrook Vance (August 28, 1916 – May 26, 2013) was an American mystery, fantasy, and science fiction writer. Though most of his work has been published under the name Jack Vance, he also wrote several mystery novels under pen names, including Ellery Queen.

Vance won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984, and he was a Guest of Honor at the 1992 World Science Fiction Convention in Orlando, Florida. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made him its 15th Grand Master in 1997, and the Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2001, its sixth class of two deceased and two living writers.

His most notable awards included Hugo Awards in 1963 for &quot;The Dragon Masters&quot;, in 1967 for &quot;The Last Castle&quot;, and in 2010 for his memoir &quot;This Is Me, Jack Vance!&quot;; the Nebula Award in 1966, also for &quot;The Last Castle&quot;; the Jupiter Award in 1975 and the World Fantasy Award in 1990 for &quot;Lyonesse: Madouc&quot;, and the Edgar Award in 1961 for the best first mystery novel for &quot;The Man in the Cage&quot;.

His first publications were stories in science fiction magazines. As he became well known, he published novellas and novels, many of which were translated into French, Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Italian and German. An Integral Edition of all Vance&#x27;s works was published in 44 volumes and in 2010 a six-volume &quot;The Complete Jack Vance&quot; was released. A 2009 profile in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; described Vance as &quot;one of American literature&#x27;s most distinctive and undervalued voices&quot;. He died at his home in Oakland, California on May 26, 2013, aged 96.

== Biography ==
Vance&#x27;s great-grandfather is believed to have arrived in California from Michigan a decade before the Gold Rush and married a San Francisco woman. Early family records were apparently destroyed in the fire following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Vance&#x27;s maternal grandfather, L. M. (Ludwig Mathias) Hoefler, was a successful lawyer in San Francisco.

Vance grew up in the family&#x27;s large house in San Francisco on Filbert Street. When Vance&#x27;s father left the family to live on his ranch in Mexico, the family&#x27;s house in San Francisco was rented out to the father&#x27;s sister. With the separation of his parents, and the loss of use of the San Francisco house, Vance&#x27;s mother moved him and his siblings to their maternal grandfather&#x27;s California ranch near Oakley in the delta of the Sacramento River. This setting formed Vance&#x27;s love of the outdoors, and allowed him time to indulge his passion as an avid reader of his mother&#x27;s large book collection, which included Edgar Rice Burroughs’ &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; and his Barsoom novels and Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. When Vance explored the nearby town, he started reading pulp fiction magazines at the local drugstore.

With the death of his grandfather, who had supported the family, which coincided with the economic challenges of the Great Depression, the Vance family’s fortune dwindled, and Vance was forced to leave junior college and work to support himself, assisting his mother when able. Vance plied many trades for short stretches: as a bellhop (a &quot;miserable year&quot;), in a cannery, and on a gold dredge. Vance described this era as a time of personal change: “Over a span of four or five years, I developed from an impractical little intellectual into a rather reckless young man, competent at many skills and crafts, and determined to try every phase of life.”

He subsequently entered the University of California, Berkeley, and over the next six years studied mining engineering, physics, journalism, and English. Vance wrote one of his first science fiction stories for an English class assignment: his professor commented in a scornful tone, &quot;We also have a piece of science fiction&quot;—Vance&#x27;s first negative review.

He worked as an electrician in the naval shipyards at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, being paid &quot;56¢ an hour,&quot; and worked for a time as part of a degaussing crew. The attack on Pearl Harbor took place about a month after he resigned his employment there.

Vance graduated in 1942. Weak eyesight prevented military service. He found a job as a rigger at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, and enrolled in an Army Intelligence program to learn Japanese, but washed out. In 1943, he memorized an eye chart and became an able seaman in the Merchant Marine. In later years, boating remained his favorite recreation; boats and voyages are a frequent motif in his work. He worked as a seaman, a rigger, a surveyor, a ceramicist, and a carpenter before he established himself fully as a writer, which did not occur until the 1970s.
From his youth, Vance had been fascinated by Dixieland and traditional jazz. He was an amateur of the cornet and ukulele, often accompanying himself with a kazoo, and was a competent harmonica player. His first published writings were jazz reviews for &quot;The Daily Californian&quot; (his college paper), and music is an element in many of his works.

In 1946, Vance met and married Norma Genevieve Ingold (died March 25, 2008), another Cal student. Vance continued to live in Oakland, in a house he built and extended with his family over the years, including a hand-carved wooden ceiling from Kashmir. The Vances traveled extensively, including on one around-the-world voyage, and often spent several months at a time living in places like Ireland, Tahiti, South Africa, Positano (in Italy) and on a houseboat on Lake Nagin in Kashmir.

Vance began trying to become a professional writer in the late 1940s, as part of the San Francisco Renaissance, a movement of experimentation in literature and the arts. His first lucrative sale was one of the early Magnus Ridolph stories to Twentieth Century Fox, who also hired him as a screenwriter for the &quot;Captain Video&quot; television series. The proceeds supported the Vances for a year&#x27;s travel in Europe. There are various references to the Bay Area Bohemian life in his work. In the 1950s, Vance started a pottery and ceramics hobby, buying a kiln; this interest was an influence on his story &quot;The Potters of Firsk” (1950).

Science fiction authors Frank Herbert and Poul Anderson were among Vance&#x27;s closest friends. In the early 1950s, when Frank Herbert was a reporter, he interviewed Vance, and the men became friends. They moved to Mexico with their families to establish a &quot;writer&#x27;s colony&quot; at Lake Chapala, near Guadalajara. In 1962, Vance, Herbert, and Anderson jointly built a houseboat which they sailed in the Sacramento Delta. Vance&#x27;s interest in houseboats led him to depict them in “The Moon Moth” (1961), &quot;The Palace of Love&quot; (1967), and in chapter 2 of &quot;Wyst: Alastor 1716&quot; (1978).

In the early 1980s, Vance became increasingly interested in sailing, and he started building a 36-foot trimaran. Later, he owned &quot;Venture&quot; (a 17-foot cutter-rigged boat), &quot;Columbia&quot; (a 35-foot ketch-rigged boat), and finally &quot;Hinano&quot; (a 45-foot boat). While Vance derived pleasure from his sailing hobby, his increasingly poor eyesight and the high costs of outfitting, berthing, and maintaining the vessel led him to sell the &quot;Hinano&quot;. Vance&#x27;s failing eyesight also led him to cease his amateur jazz hobby.

Although legally blind since the 1980s, Vance continued to write with the aid of BigEd software, written especially for him by Kim Kokkonen. His final novel was &quot;Lurulu&quot;. Although Vance had stated &quot;Lurulu&quot; would be his final book, he subsequently completed an autobiography, which was published in July 2009.

=== Death ===
Vance died on the morning of May 26, 2013, at the age of 96 in his home in the Oakland Hills. Vance&#x27;s son John Holbrook Vance II described the cause as the complications of old age, saying &quot;everything just finally caught up with him&quot;. Tributes to Vance were given by various authors, including George R. R. Martin, Michael Moorcock, Neil Gaiman, and Elizabeth Bear. Steven Gould, president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, described Vance as &quot;one of the greatest science fiction and fantasy writers of the 20th century&quot;. A memorial site set up by his family to post tributes received hundreds of messages in the days following his death.

==Work==
Vance made his debut in print with &quot;The World-Thinker&quot;, a 16-page story published by Sam Merwin in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, Summer 1945. His lifetime output totals more than 60 books—perhaps almost 90. His work has been published in three categories: science fiction, fantasy, and mystery. Among Vance&#x27;s earliest published work was a set of fantasy stories written while he served in the merchant marine during the war. They appeared in 1950, several years after Vance had started publishing science fiction in the pulp magazines, under the title &quot;The Dying Earth&quot;.

Vance wrote many science fiction short stories in the late 1940s and through the 1950s, which were published in magazines. Of his novels written during this period, a few were science fiction, but most were mysteries. Few were published at the time, but Vance continued to write mysteries into the early 1970s. In total, he wrote 15 novels outside of science fiction and fantasy, including the extended outline, &quot;The Telephone was Ringing in the Dark&quot;, published only by the VIE (Vance Integral Edition), and three books published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. Some of these are not mysteries, such as &quot;Bird Isle&quot;, and many fit uneasily in the category. These stories are set in and around his native San Francisco, except for one set in Italy and another in Africa. Two begin in San Francisco but take to the sea.

Many themes important to his more famous science fiction novels appeared first in the mysteries. The most obvious is the &quot;book of dreams&quot;, which appears in &quot;Bad Ronald&quot; and &quot;The View from Chickweed&#x27;s Window&quot;, prior to being featured in &quot;The Book of Dreams&quot;. The revenge theme is also more prominent in certain mysteries than in the science fiction (&quot;The View from Chickweed&#x27;s Window&quot; in particular). &quot;Bad Ronald&quot; was adapted to a TV film of the same name aired on ABC in 1974, as well as a French production (&quot;Méchant garçon&quot;) in 1992; this and &quot;Man in the Cage&quot; are the only works by Vance to be made into film to date.
Certain of the science fiction stories are also mysteries, penned using his full name John Holbrook Vance, three under the house pseudonym Ellery Queen, and one each using the pseudonyms Alan Wade, Peter Held, John van See, and Jay Kavanse. Some editions of his published works give his year of birth as 1920. In addition to the comic Magnus Ridolph stories, two major stories feature the effectuator Miro Hetzel, a futuristic detective, and &quot;Araminta Station&quot; is largely concerned with solving various murders. Vance returned to the &quot;dying Earth&quot; setting (a far distant future in which the sun is slowly going out, and magic and technology coexist) to write the picaresque adventures of the ne&#x27;er-do-well scoundrel Cugel the Clever, and those of the magician Rhialto the Marvellous. These books were written in 1963, 1978 and 1981. His other major fantasy work, &quot;Lyonesse&quot; (a trilogy comprising &quot;Suldrun&#x27;s Garden&quot;, &quot;The Green Pearl&quot;, and &quot;Madouc&quot;), was completed in 1989 and set on a mythological archipelago off the coast of France in the early Middle Ages.

Vance&#x27;s stories written for pulps in the 1940s and 1950s covered many science fiction themes, with a tendency to emphasize mysterious and biological themes (ESP, genetics, brain parasites, body switching, other dimensions, cultures) rather than technical ones. Robots, for example, are almost entirely absent, though the short story &quot;The Uninhibited Robot&quot; features a computer gone awry. Many of the early stories are comic. By the 1960s, Vance had developed a futuristic setting that he came to call the Gaean Reach, a fictional region of space settled by humans. Thereafter, all his science fiction was, more or less explicitly, set therein. The Gaean Reach per se is loose and expanding, old Earth (Gaia) being the center. Each planet has its own history, state of development and culture. Within the Reach conditions tend to be peaceable and commerce tends to dominate. At the edges of the Reach, out in the lawless Beyond, conditions are usually much less secure.

Vance influenced many writers in the genre. Most notably, Michael Shea wrote a sequel to &quot;Eyes of the Overworld&quot;, featuring Cugel the Clever, before Vance did one himself (called &quot;Cugel&#x27;s Saga&quot;). Vance gave permission, and the book by Shea went into print before Vance&#x27;s. Shea&#x27;s book, &quot;A Quest for Simbilis&quot;, is entirely in keeping with the vision of Vance. Cugel is a complete rogue, who is nevertheless worthy of sympathy in always failing to achieve his goals.

=== Literary influences ===

When asked about literary influences, Vance most often cited Jeffery Farnol, a writer of adventure books, whose style of &quot;high&quot; language he mentions (the Farnol title &quot;Guyfford of Weare&quot; being a typical instance); P. G. Wodehouse, an influence apparent in Vance&#x27;s taste for overbearing aunts; and L. Frank Baum, whose fantasy elements were directly borrowed by Vance (see &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;). In the introduction to Dowling and Strahan&#x27;s &quot;The Jack Vance Treasury&quot;, Vance mentions that his childhood reading including Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jules Verne, Robert W. Chambers, science fiction published by Edward Stratemeyer, the magazines &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and Lord Dunsany. According to pulp editor Sam Merwin, Vance&#x27;s earliest magazine submissions in the 1940s were heavily influenced by the style of James Branch Cabell. Fantasy historian Lin Carter notes several probable lasting influences of Cabell on Vance&#x27;s work, and suggests that the early &quot;pseudo-Cabell&quot; experiments bore fruit in &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; (1950). Science fiction critic Don Herron cites Clark Ashton Smith as an influence on Vance&#x27;s style and characters&#x27; names.

=== Characteristics and commentary ===
Vance&#x27;s science fiction runs the gamut from stories written for pulps in the 1940s to multi-volume tales set in the space age. Scott Bradfield states that Vance &quot;wrote about incomprehensibly far-off futures that weren’t driven by the splashy intergalactic military conflicts of his Golden Age predecessors, such as E.E. Doc Smith or Robert A. Heinlein. Instead, Vance’s futures are marked by rich, panoramic socioeconomic systems.&quot; While Vance&#x27;s stories have a wide variety of temporal settings, a majority of them belong to a period long after humanity has colonized other stars, culminating in the development of a fictional region of interstellar space called the Gaean Reach. In its early phase, exhibited by the Oikumene of the Demon Princes series, this expanding, loose and pacific agglomerate has an aura of colonial adventure, commerce and exoticism. Later it becomes peace-loving and stolidly middle class.

Vance&#x27;s stories are seldom concerned directly with war and the conflicts are rarely direct. If there are battles, such as in the slave revolt against the nobility at the end of &quot;The Last Castle&quot;, they are depicted in an abbreviated length, as Vance is more interested in the social and political context than the clashing of swords. Sometimes at the edges of the Reach or in the lawless areas of Beyond, a planet is menaced or craftily exploited. Some more extensive battles are described in &quot;The Dragon Masters&quot;, &quot;The Miracle Workers&quot;, and the &quot;Lyonesse Trilogy&quot;, in which medieval-style combat abounds. His characters usually become inadvertently enmeshed in low-intensity conflicts between alien cultures; this is the case in &quot;Emphyrio&quot;, the Tschai series, the Durdane series, and the comic stories in &quot;Galactic Effectuator&quot;, featuring Miro Hetzel. Personal, cultural, social, or political conflicts are the central concerns. This is most particularly the case in the Cadwal series, though it is equally characteristic of the three Alastor books, &quot;&quot;, and, one way or another, in most of his science fiction novels.

Another way in which Vance expands the usually narrow focus of most speculative fiction writers is the extensive details ranging from the culture of language to food, music, and rituals. In &quot;The Languages of Pao&quot;, after a planet with a passive, lazy and backwards culture is invaded and occupied, the planet&#x27;s leader orders three new languages developed, to make his people more aggressive, industrious and inventive. In the short story &quot;The Moon Moth&quot;, natives must master a number of musical instruments in order to communicate with each other. Spoken words are modulated to acquire different meanings, or may be said to be given full meaning (respect, derision or sarcasm), by means of the musical sounds. These details paint a far more detailed and complex picture of life and cultures in his books.

The &quot;Joe Bain&quot; stories (&quot;The Fox Valley Murders&quot;, &quot;The Pleasant Grove Murders&quot;, and an unfinished outline published by the VIE) are set in an imaginary northern California county; these are the nearest to the classical mystery form, with a rural policeman as protagonist. &quot;Bird Isle&quot;, by contrast, is not a mystery at all, but a Wodehousian idyll (also set near San Francisco), while &quot;The Flesh Mask&quot; or &quot;Strange People ...&quot; emphasize psychological drama. The theme of both &quot;The House on Lily Street&quot; and &quot;Bad Ronald&quot; is solipsistic megalomania, taken up again in the Demon Princes cycle of science fiction novels.

Three books published under the house name Ellery Queen were written to editorial requirements and heavily revised by the publisher. (Volume 45 of The Vance Integral Edition contains the original text for the three Ellery Queen novels. Vance previously refused to acknowledge them for their degree of rewriting.) Four others reflect Vance&#x27;s world travels: &quot;Strange People, Queer Notions&quot; based on his stay in Positano, Italy; &quot;The Man in the Cage&quot;, based on a trip to Morocco; &quot;The Dark Ocean&quot;, set on a merchant marine vessel; and &quot;The Deadly Isles&quot;, based on a stay in Tahiti.

The mystery novels reveal much about Vance&#x27;s evolution as a science fiction and fantasy writer. He stopped working in the mystery genre in the early 1970s, except for science-fiction mysteries; see below. &quot;Bad Ronald&quot; is especially noteworthy for its portrayal of a trial-run for Howard Alan Treesong of &quot;The Book of Dreams&quot;. The Edgar-Award-winning &quot;The Man in the Cage&quot; is a thriller set in North Africa at around the period of the French-Algerian war. &quot;A Room to Die In&quot; is a classic &#x27;locked-room&#x27; murder mystery featuring a strong-willed young woman as the amateur detective. &quot;Bird Isle&quot;, a mystery set at a hotel on an island off the California coast, reflects Vance&#x27;s taste for farce.

Vance&#x27;s two rural Northern California mysteries featuring Sheriff Joe Bain were well received by the critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of &quot;The Fox Valley Murders&quot;: &quot;Mr. Vance has created the county with the same detailed and loving care with which, in the science fiction he writes as Jack Vance, he can create a believable alien planet.&quot; Dorothy B. Hughes, in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote that it was &quot;fat with character and scene&quot;. As for the second Bain novel, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;I like regionalism in American detective stories, and I enjoy reading about the problems of a rural county sheriff ... and I bless John Holbrook Vance for the best job of satisfying these tastes with his wonderful tales of Sheriff Joe Bain ...&quot;.

Vance has also written mysteries set in his science fiction universes. An early 1950s short story series features Magnus Ridolph, an interstellar adventurer and amateur detective who is elderly and not prone to knocking anyone down, and whose exploits appear to have been inspired, in part, by those of Jack London&#x27;s South Seas adventurer, Captain David Grief. The &quot;Galactic Effectuator&quot; novelettes feature Miro Hetzel, a figure who resembles Ridolph in his blending of detecting and troubleshooting (the &quot;effectuating&quot; indicated by the title). A number of the other science fiction novels include mystery, spy thriller, or crime-novel elements: &quot;The Houses of Iszm&quot;, &quot;Son of the Tree&quot;, the Alastor books &quot;Trullion&quot; and &quot;Marune&quot;, the Cadwal series, and large parts of the Demon Princes series.

According to writer Michael Chabon, &quot;Jack Vance is the most painful case of all the writers I love who I feel don’t get the credit they deserve. If ‘The Last Castle’ or ‘The Dragon Masters’ had the name Italo Calvino on it, or just a foreign name, it would be received as a profound meditation, but because he&#x27;s Jack Vance and published in Amazing Whatever, there&#x27;s this insurmountable barrier.&quot;

Vance fans developed a website called Totality (pharesm.org), which enables users to do electronic searches of the Vance Integral Edition texts.

== Publication ==
For most of his career, Vance&#x27;s work suffered the vicissitudes common to most writers in his chosen field: ephemeral publication of stories in magazine form, short-lived softcover editions, in which stories sometimes were insensitively edited beyond his control. As he became more widely recognized, conditions improved, and his works became internationally renowned among aficionados. Much of his work has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Esperanto, French, Spanish, Russian, and Italian. Beginning in the 1960s, Jack Vance&#x27;s work has also been extensively translated into German. In the large German-language market, his books continue to be widely read.

Vance was an original member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s and led by Lin Carter. Its purpose was to promote the sword and sorcery subgenre (such as Dying Earth stories by Vance), and some new works were published in &quot;Flashing Swords!&quot; anthologies edited by Carter, in both mass-market paperback and Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club editions.

In 1976, the fantasy/sf small press Underwood-Miller released their first publication, the first hardcover edition of &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; in a high-quality limited edition of just over 1000 copies. Other titles in the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; cycle also received hardcover treatment from Underwood-Miller shortly thereafter, such as &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot; and &quot;Cugel&#x27;s Saga&quot;. After these first publications and until the mid-1990s, Underwood-Miller published many of Vance&#x27;s works, including his mystery fiction, often in limited editions featuring dustjacket artwork by leading fantasy artists. The entire Jack Vance output from Underwood-Miller comes close to a complete collection of Vance&#x27;s previously published works, many of which had not seen hardcover publication. Also, many of these editions are described as &quot;the author&#x27;s preferred text&quot;, meaning that they have not been drastically edited. In the mid-1990s, Tim Underwood and Charles Miller parted company. However, they have continued to publish Vance titles individually, including such works as &quot;Emphyrio&quot; and &quot;To Live Forever&quot; by Miller, and a reprint edition of &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot; by Underwood. Because of the low print-run on many of these titles, often they could only be found in science fiction bookstores at the time of their release.

=== The Vance Integral Edition ===
An Integral Edition of all Vance&#x27;s works was published in a limited edition of 44 hardback volumes. A special 45th volume contains the three novels Vance wrote as Ellery Queen. This edition was created from 1999 to 2006 by 300 volunteers working via the internet, under the aegis of the author. The texts and titles used are those preferred by the author.

In 2010, Afton House Books presented &quot;The Complete Jack Vance&quot; in six large volumes using texts prepared by the Vance Integral Edition. Volume six has a table of contents for the volumes; otherwise there is no exegesis. Issues of the project&#x27;s magazine &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; describe the production process (of interest to anyone wishing accurate transcription of scanned text) and the detection of some surprising errors such as the scanning of &quot;and&quot; being recognised as &quot;arid&quot; (&quot;Cosmopolis 17&quot;, page 8) yet resulting in a sentence that is both grammatically acceptable and plausible in context: &quot;It was hot, arid dusty.&quot; Similarly, there is no bibliography of where the stories have previously been published. Cover art may be found via :Category:Jack Vance book cover images or at geofftaylor-artist.com and many other places.

In 2012, Spatterlight Press started offering DRM-free e-books editions of many of the works of Jack Vance, based on the source texts collected by the Integral Edition project. It is the intent of Spatterlight Press to publish the complete Integral Edition in e-book form, and also as print-on-demand paperbacks. Gollancz uses the VIE texts in their &quot;SF Gateway&quot; editions starting in 2012.

==Works inspired by Vance==
* &quot;A Quest for Simbilis&quot; by Michael Shea (DAW, NY, 1974; authorized sequel of the Cugel novel &quot;Eyes of the Overworld&quot; although Vance later wrote his own sequel &quot;Cugel the Clever&quot;; Shea also wrote &quot;Nifft the Lean&quot; (DAW, NY, 1982), and &quot;The Mines of Behemoth&quot; (1997) about a Cugel-like character; and &quot;In Yana, the Touch of Undying&quot; (DAW, NY, 1985) which is also Vancian. &quot;A Quest for Simbilis&quot; was reprinted in 2020 by Spatterlight Press under the &quot;Paladins of Vance&quot; label.).
* The &quot;Archonate&quot; series by Matthew Hughes (beginning with &quot;Fools Errant&quot; (Aspect Books, 2001)) is set in a Vancean universe which at long intervals changes between running on science and rational cause-and-effect to magic and sympathetic association, with cataclysmic effects for its inhabitants. Stories set before this change, including the Henghis Hapthorn and Luff Imbry series, take place in a futuristic space opera setting reminiscent of Vance&#x27;s Gaean Reach while those set after, including the Raffalon and Baldemar series, are in the Dying Earth subgenre. Hughes also published an authorised sequel to the &quot;Demon Princes&quot; series with Spatterlight Press under the &quot;Paladins of Vance&quot; label; titled &quot;Barbarians of the Beyond&quot;, the book was released in summer 2021.

* &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by George R. R. Martin has a minor character, &quot;Lord Vance of Wayfarer&#x27;s Rest&quot;, with daughters named Liane, Rhialta, and Emphyria for Liane the Wayfarer, Rhialto the Marvellous, and Emphyrio, respectively.
* &quot;Intergalactic Words: Articles for Consideration&quot; (2011), a series of articles by Joseph Wykel, is strongly influenced by Vance, particularly the article &quot;Solo Ball Future&quot; about the dying sun.

<doc id="59361" wikidata="Q2466933" url="?curid=59361" title="Eiji Tsuburaya">
<text>was a Japanese special effects director, filmmaker, and cinematographer. A co-creator of the &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot; franchises, he is considered one of the most important and influential figures in the history of cinema. Tsuburaya is known as the having pioneered Japan&#x27;s special effects industry and introduced several technological developments in film productions. In a career spanning five decades, Tsuburaya worked on approximately 250 films—including globally renowned features directed by Ishirō Honda, Hiroshi Inagaki, and Akira Kurosawa—and earned six Japan Technical Awards.

Following a brief stint as an inventor, Tsuburaya was employed by Japanese cinema pioneer Yoshirō Edamasa in 1919 and began his career working as an assistant cinematographer on Edamasa&#x27;s &quot;A Tune of Pity&quot;. Thereafter, he worked as an assistant cinematographer on several films, including Teinosuke Kinugasa&#x27;s &quot;A Page of Madness&quot; (1926). At the age of thirty-two, Tsuburaya watched &quot;King Kong&quot;, which greatly influenced him to work in special effects. Tsuburaya completed the first iron shooting crane in October 1934, and an adaptation of the crane is still in use across the globe today. After filming his directorial debut on the cruiser &quot;Asama&quot; in the Pacific Ocean, he worked on &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot; (1935), one of Japan&#x27;s first major films to incorporate special effects. His first majorly successful film in effects, &quot;The Daughter of the Samurai&quot; (1937), remarkably featured the first full-scale rear projection.

In 1937, Tsuburaya was employed by Toho and established the company&#x27;s effects department. Tsuburaya directed the effects for &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot; in 1942, which became the highest-grossing Japanese film in history upon its release. His elaborate effects were believed to be behind the film&#x27;s major success, and he won an award for his work from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. In 1948, however, Tsuburaya was purged from Toho by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers because of his involvement in propaganda films during World War II. Thus, he founded Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory with his eldest son Hajime and worked without credit at major Japanese studios outside Toho, creating effects for films such as Daiei&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Man Appears&quot; (1949), widely regarded as the first Japanese science fiction film.

In 1950, Tsuburaya returned to Toho alongside his effects crew from Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory. At age fifty-three, he gained international recognition and won his first Japan Technical Award for Special Skill for directing the effects in Ishirō Honda&#x27;s &quot;kaiju&quot; film &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954). He served as the effects director for Toho&#x27;s string of financially successful &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films that followed, including, &quot;Rodan&quot; (1956), &quot;The Mysterians&quot; (1957), &quot;The Three Treasures&quot; (1959), &quot;Mothra&quot;, &quot;The Last War&quot; (both 1961), and &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; (1962). In April 1963, Tsuburaya founded Tsuburaya Special Effects Productions; his company would go onto produce the television shows &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot; (both 1966), &quot;Ultraseven&quot; (1967–1968), and &quot;Mighty Jack&quot; (1968). &quot;Ultra Q&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot; were extremely successful upon their 1966 broadcast, with &quot;Ultra Q&quot; making him a household name in Japan and gaining him more attention from the media who dubbed him the &quot;God of &quot;Tokusatsu&quot;&quot;. While he spent his late years working on several Toho films and operating his company, Tsuburaya&#x27;s health began to decline, and he died in 1970.

==Biography==
===Childhood to war years: 1901–1945===
====Childhood and youth (1901–1919)====

Eiji Tsuburaya was born on July 7, 1901, at a merchant house called Ōtsukaya in Sukagawa, Iwase, Fukushima Prefecture, where his family ran a malted rice business. He was the first son of Isamu Shiraishi and Sei Tsumuraya, with a large extended family. When Tsuburaya was three years old, his mother Sei died of illness at the age of nineteen, shortly after giving birth to her second son. Bereaved by Sei&#x27;s death, Shiraishi divorced her posthumously and left the family, leaving Tsuburaya in the care of his grandmother Natsu. Through Natsu, Tsuburaya was related to the Edo period painter Aōdō Denzen, who brought copper printing and Western painting to Japan, from whom Tsuburaya considered to have inherited his manual dexterity. His uncle Ichirō, who was Sei&#x27;s younger brother, was five years older than him and acted like an elder brother to him. Thus, Tsuburaya began to use the nickname Eiji (&quot;ji&quot; indicating second-born) instead of Eiichi (&quot;ichi&quot; indicating first-born).

In 1908, he started attending the Dai&#x27;ichi Jinjo Koto Elementary School in Sukagawa, and it was soon realized that he had a talent for drawing. During his boyhood, Tsuburaya became interested in flying because of the recent success of Japanese aviators; he soon started building model airplanes as a hobby, an interest he would pursue throughout his entire life.

In 1913, Tsuburaya saw his first film, which featured footage of a volcanic eruption on Sakurajima; in the process, he was more fascinated by the projector than the movie itself. In 1958, Tsuburaya told &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; that because he was extremely fascinated by the projector, he purchased a &quot;toy movie viewer&quot; and created his own film strips by &quot;carefully cutting rolled paper, then making sprocket holes, and drawing stick figures [on the paper], frame by frame.&quot; Because of his craftwork at a young age, he became a provincial celebrity and was interviewed by the &quot;&quot;.

In 1915, at the age of 14, he graduated from junior high school, and begged his family to let him enroll in the Nippon Flying School at Haneda. After the school was closed on account of the accidental death of its founder, Seitaro Tamai, in 1917, Tsuburaya switched to the Tokyo Kanda Electrical Engineering School (now Tokyo Denki University). While at the school, he started working as an inventor at the toy company Utsumi, and devised inventions including the first battery-powered phone capable of making calls, an automatic speed photo box, an &quot;automatic skate&quot; and the toy phone. The latter two earned him a patent fee of .

====Early career and marriage (1919–1934)====

During a &quot;hanami&quot; party held at a tea house in the spring of 1919, Tsuburaya met Yoshirō Edamasa, a pioneer of Japanese cinema. Edamasa asked Tsuburaya if he was interested in movies or photography; after he explained to Edamasa that he was interested in motion pictures, Tsuburaya accepted the director&#x27;s offer to become an employee at his company, the Natural Color Motion Pictures Company (dubbed &quot;Tenkatsu&quot;). Therefore, Tsuburaya began working in the film industry at the age of eighteen, as Edamasa&#x27;s camera assistant, contributing to films such as &quot;A Tune of Pity&quot; (1919) and &quot;Tombs of the Island&quot; (1920); reportedly, he also served as a screenwriter during this period. Despite Tenkatsu becoming part of the Kokatsu Company and Edamasa leaving his job in March 1920, Tsuburaya kept working at the studio until he was ordered to serve the Imperial Japanese Army between 1921 and December 1922.

After leaving the army in 1923, Tsuburaya moved back to his family&#x27;s house in Sukagawa. However, he suddenly departed just a few months later, in order to pursue a more established career within the filmmaking industry. In the morning of his departure from home, he left a note: &quot;I won&#x27;t return home until I succeed in the motion picture business, even if I die trying.&quot; The next year, he worked as the cinematographer on the film &quot;The Hunchback of Enmei&#x27;in Temple&quot;. Tsuburaya joined Shochiku in 1925 and would have his breakthrough as the cameraman and assistant director on Teinosuke Kinugasa&#x27;s &quot;A Page of Madness&quot; (released the following year). In 1927, he shot Minoru Inuzuka&#x27;s &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films &quot;Children&#x27;s Swordplay&quot; and &quot;Melee&quot;, both starring Kazuo Hasegawa and Tsuyako Okajima, as well as Toko Yamazaki&#x27;s &quot;The Bat Copybook&quot;, &quot;Mad Blade Under the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Record of the Tragic Swords of the Tenpo Era&quot;. Because of the financial success of these films, Tsuburaya started being regarded as one of Kyoto&#x27;s leading cinematographers.

In 1928, while working on eleven films at Shochiku, Tsuburaya began creating and utilizing new camera operating techniques, including double-exposure and slow-motion camerawork. The next year, Tsuburaya constructed his own smaller version of D. W. Griffith&#x27;s 140-foot tall shooting crane: having invented it without the benefit of using blueprints or manuals, the wooden crane allowed Tsuburaya to improve camera movement and was able to be used in and outside the studio. The creation proved to be a success, although it did not guarantee total safety: one day, while Tsuburaya and an assistant were preparing the crane in order to film a scene, the structure collapsed, sending him plummeting to the ground of the studio. A witness of the incident, named Masano Araki, was one of the first people to run to his aid: she visited Tsuburaya daily while he was hospitalized, and the pair formed a relationship shortly thereafter. On February 27, 1930, Tsuburaya married the decade-younger Araki. Their first child, Hajime, was born on April 23, 1931.

In May 1932, Tsuburaya, Akira Mimura, Hiroshi Sakai, Kohei Sugiyama, Masao Tamai, and Tadayuki Yokota established the Japan Cameraman Association, which later coalesced with other companies to become the Nippon Cinematographers Club (now known as the ). Shortly after that, the association would start to hold award ceremonies. In November of that same year, Tsuburaya quit Shochiku and joined Nikkatsu Futosou Studios. Around the same time, he began using the professional name &quot;Eiji Tsuburaya&quot;.

In 1933, Tsuburaya saw the American film &quot;King Kong&quot;, which inspired him to work on movies featuring special effects. In 1962, Tsuburaya told the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; that he attempted to convince Nikkatsu to &quot;import this technical know-how, but they had little interest in it because, at the time, I was seen as merely a cameraman who worked on Kazuo Hasegawa&#x27;s historical dramas&quot;. He managed to acquire a 35mm print of &quot;King Kong&quot; and started to study the film&#x27;s special effects frame-by-frame, without the advantage of documents explaining how they were produced: he would later write an analysis of the film&#x27;s effects for the magazine &quot;Photo Times&quot; in October 1933. In the same year, Masano gave birth to a second child, a daughter named Miyako. However, the child would die of unknown causes in 1935.

In December 1933, Nikkatsu granted Tsuburaya permission to use and study new screen projection technology for the company&#x27;s &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films. However, while the studio agreed with his decision to project these films cast into a location use using location plates, not all of his technological developments were met with approval. While he was filming the final scenes for &quot;Asataro Descends Mt. Akagi&quot; in February 1934, Tsuburaya fell out with Nikkatsu&#x27;s CEO, who had no acquaintance with what Tsuburaya was creating and assumed that he was wasting the company&#x27;s money. After the argument, Tsuburaya resigned from his job at Nikkatsu.

====J.O. Studios, directorial works, and Toho (1934–1940)====
Shortly after leaving Nikkatsu, he accepted an offer from Kyoto entrepreneur Yoshio Osawa to work at his company, J.O. Talkies, and research optical printing and screen projection. In October 1934, Tsuburaya and his colleagues completed the first iron shooting crane model and used it to shoot Atsuo Tomioka&#x27;s &quot;The Chorus of a Million&quot;. In contrast to his previous prototype, the crane was installed on a truck that operated on tracks, which made it able to change the camera&#x27;s position in a matter of seconds. In December of that year, Osawa renamed the studio J.O. Studios and designated Tsuburaya as its chief cinematographer.

From February to August 1935, he traveled to Hawaii, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand on the cruiser &quot;Asama&quot; in order to shoot his directorial debut, &quot;Three Thousand Miles Across the Equator&quot;, a feature-length propaganda documentary film. During the expedition, his second son, Noboru, was born on May 10, 1935.

Upon returning from the voyage, Tsuburaya began work on &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot;, an adaptation of the 10th-century Japanese literary tale &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;. He did not only serve as the film&#x27;s cinematographer, but was also in charge of special effects for the first time. For the film, he worked with animator Kenzō Masaoka to create miniatures, puppets, a composite of Kaguya emerging from a cut bamboo plant, and a sequence in which a ship encounters a storm. While the original print of the film is considered to be lost, a shortened version, screened in England in 1936, was discovered by a researcher at the British Film Institute in May 2015: this version was released in Japan on September 4 and 5, 2021, as part of an event celebrating Tsuburaya&#x27;s 120th birthday.
In March of the next year, Tsuburaya&#x27;s directorial debut, the theatrical play &quot;Folk Song Collection: Oichi of Torioi Village&quot;, was released: it was an adventure film concerning a condemned romance and featuring political tones. &quot;Folk Song Collection: Oichi of Torioi Village&quot; was the second film to ever star popular geisha singer Ichimaru, while also featuring actor Kenji Susukida. Soon after its completion, Tsuburaya began working on Arnold Fanck&#x27;s &quot;The Daughter of the Samurai&quot; (released in 1937). &quot;The Daughter of the Samurai&quot; was the first German-Japanese co-production, and is considered to be Tsuburaya&#x27;s first major success as a special effects director, since it featured the first full-scale rear projection. The German staff were allegedly impressed by his elaborate miniature work on the project.

In September 1936, Ichizō Kobayashi merged the film studios P.C.L. Studios and P.C.L. Film Company with J.O. Studios to create the film and theatre production company Toho. Film producer was appointed as production manager at Toho: having become aware of the importance of special effects during a tour in Hollywood, in 1937 Mori hired Tsuburaya at the company&#x27;s studio in Tokyo, establishing the special effects department on November 27, 1937, and treating him as the section&#x27;s manager. Shortly after, Tsuburaya received a research budget and began studying optical printers to create Japan&#x27;s first version of the device, which he designed. Among Tsuburaya&#x27;s first film assignments at Toho were &quot;The Abe Clan&quot;, a &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film directed by Hisatora Kumagai, and the unreleased propaganda musical &quot;The Song of Major Nango&quot; (both 1938). The latter film was directed and shot by Tsuburaya, and he completed it on September 6 of that year.

In 1939, he was ordered to join the Kumagaya Aviation Academy of the Imperial Army Corps, where he was entrusted to shoot flight-training films. After impressing his superiors with his aerial photography, Tsuburaya was given more assignments and a master&#x27;s certificate during his almost three years at the academy. In November 1939, while Tsuburaya was still at the flight school and undertaking assignments at Toho, he was appointed head of Toho&#x27;s Special Arts Department. A month after that, he was commissioned to shoot a science film for Toho&#x27;s then-recently assembled educational section. Under governance demands, Toho was mandated to maintain the creation of propaganda films. Accordingly, in May 1940, Tsuburaya began directing the documentary &quot;The Imperial Way of Japan&quot; for Toho Education Films&#x27; branch, the Toho National Policy Film Association. He was given his first ever credits for special effects for his work on Sotoji Kimura&#x27;s &quot;Navy Bomber Squadron&quot;, which featured a bombing scene with a miniature airplane. &quot;Navy Bomber Squadron&quot; was believed to be lost for over sixty years, until an unfinished copy of the film was discovered and screened in 2006.

In September 1940, Yutaka Abe&#x27;s &quot;The Burning Sky&quot;, was released to Japanese cinemas. Tsuburaya was in charge of effects for the film and received his first accolade from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. His next undertaking, &quot;Son Gokū&quot;, was released on November 6, 1940. During an interview for the August 1960 issue of &quot;American Cinematographer&quot;, he broke down the creative process behind &quot;Son Gokū&quot;, saying: &quot;I was called upon to create and photograph a monkey-like monster which was supposed to fly through the air&quot;, adding: &quot;I managed the job with some success and this assignment set the pattern for my future work.&quot;

====War years (1941–1945)====

On December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service suddenly attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor: consequently, the Imperial Japanese Government tasked Toho to produce a propaganda film that would influence the nation to believe they would win the Pacific War. The resulting film, Kajirō Yamamoto&#x27;s war epic &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot; (1942), became the highest-grossing Japanese film in history upon its release in December 1942 and won &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;&#x27;s Best Film Award. Tsuburaya directed its effects, which he created with the assistance of navy-provided photographs of the Pearl Harbor attack: in the process, he also worked with future &quot;Godzilla&quot; collaborates Akira Watanabe and Teizō Toshimitsu for the first time in his career. His work on the film was supposedly one of the main reasons behind its major success and gained him the Technical Research Award from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. The film depicted the attack so realistically that footage from it was later featured in documentaries on the Pearl Harbor attack.

Around the same time as &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot; was in production, Toho&#x27;s effects department was filming Japan&#x27;s first puppet film, &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The film&#x27;s screenplay—based on the Sanskrit epic of the same name—had been written by future &quot;Moonlight Mask&quot; creator Kōhan Kawauchi in 1941, under Tsuburaya&#x27;s supervision.

Tsuburaya&#x27;s next four major productions were all war films: Masahiro Makino&#x27;s &quot;The Opium War&quot;, Tadashi Imai&#x27;s &quot;Watchtower Suicide Squad&quot;, Kunio Watanabe&#x27;s &quot;Decisive Battle in the Skies&quot; and Kajirō Yamamoto&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot;, &quot;General Kato&#x27;s Falcon Fighters&quot; (all produced in 1943). For &quot;The Opium War&quot;, Tsuburaya and his team created miniature navy battle sequences and animation synthesis in urban landscapes. During the production of &quot;General Kato&#x27;s Falcon Fighters&quot; (released in 1944), Tsuburaya had his first meeting with future collaborator and filmmaker Ishirō Honda. After watching &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot;, Honda became interested in special effects and believed Tsuburaya&#x27;s work in &quot;General Kato&#x27;s Falcon Fighters&quot; was inferior in scope, but the art and gunpowder technology had enhanced. Additionally, Tsuburaya expressed dissatisfaction with the size of the shooting stage, the art materials, the method of performance, etc.

Shortly before Toho distributed &quot;General Kato&#x27;s Falcon Fighters&quot; in cinemas, Masano and Tsuburaya&#x27;s third son and last child, Akira, was born on February 12, 1944. Akira was the first of the couple&#x27;s sons to be baptized, since Masano had been converted to Catholicism by her younger sister. Masano persisted in introducing her children to the Catholic faith and ultimately converted her husband.

In 1944, Tsuburaya met future &quot;Godzilla&quot; producer Tomoyuki Tanaka during the production of the Mikio Naruse-directed war film &#x27;, which was Tanaka&#x27;s debut as a film producer. Tanaka stated that he did not develop a serious connection with Tsuburaya during the film&#x27;s production. The following year, the special effects director collaborated with Tanaka for the second time on Kiyoshi Saeki&#x27;s &#x27;.

On March 10, 1945, Tsuburaya and his family sought refuge for two hours in their residence&#x27;s bomb shelter during the Tokyo air raids. During the two-hour-long attacks, he told his children fairy tales to keep them quiet. Later that year, Tsuburaya made the effects in Torajirō Saitō&#x27;s &quot;Five Men from Tokyo&quot;, for which he was credited as &quot;Eiichi Tsuburaya&quot;. &quot;Five Men from Tokyo&quot; is a comedy film concerning five men who struggle to make a living after returning to Tokyo and remaining unemployed due to the Tokyo air raids on March 10, 1945, at the end of World War II.

=== Occupation years to &quot;Chūshingura&quot;: 1946–1962 ===
==== Early postwar work (1946–1954) ====
Even though Toho was unaffected by the Tokyo bombings, as the company was located in Seijo, the amount of film productions was reduced due to the Occupation of Japan. Because of this, the company produced only eighteen films in 1946, with Tsuburaya working on eight of them. During the same year, Tsuburaya became head of the special effects production department at Toho and established its cinematography, compositing, art, and development units. Since he and his effects unit at the company had a minor slate of films to work on, they also began testing matte painting and optical printing.

Toho was on the verge of disbandment due to the three major labor disputes that occurred at the studio during the late 1940s. According to Akira Tsuburaya, his father had to sneak around the Japanese police and U.S. tanks deployed during these strikes and disputes in order to get to work. To repel the police, the labor strikers erected a barricade, using a large fan, made by the special effects department of the company, which was equipped with the Zero fighter engine that Tsuburaya had used during the war. These events led to the creation of Shintoho; Tsuburaya would create the effects for the studio&#x27;s first film, &quot;A Thousand and One Nights with Toho&quot; (1947).

In late March 1948, Tsuburaya was purged from Toho by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers because of his involvement in propaganda films during World War II. The U.S. occupation officials reportedly expelled him assuming he had access to classified documents when creating the comprehensive miniatures featured in &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot;, which led them to inaccurately conclude that he was a spy. Consequently, Toho disbanded their special effects division and Tsuburaya, together with his son Hajime, founded the independent special effects company , an unofficial juridical entity. Henceforth, he worked at major film studios outside Toho without on-screen credit.
In 1949, five major Daiei Film productions featuring effects directed by Tsuburaya were released to Japanese theaters: Japanese horror filmmaker Bin Kato&#x27;s &quot;The White Haired Fiend&quot;, Keigo Kimura&#x27;s &quot;Flowers of Raccoon Palace&quot;, Kiyohiko Ushihara&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow Man&quot;, Akira Nobuchi&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost Train&quot;, and Nobuo Adachi&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Man Appears&quot;. This last movie was the first successful Japanese science fiction film, as well as the country&#x27;s first adaption of H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. Created by studying the eponymous 1933 film adaptation of Wells&#x27; novel, Daiei had intended this film to be Tsuburaya&#x27;s full-scale post-war recovery, featuring special effects superior in quality to those in Universal Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; film series. Tsuburaya, however, was disappointed with his lack of competence on the project and gave up his ambition to become a Daiei employee after &quot;The Invisible Man Appears&quot; was finished.

In 1950, Tsuburaya relocated some equipment and employees at Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory to Toho&#x27;s headquarters; his independent company was merely the size of six &quot;tatami&quot; mats inside Toho Studios. In the same year, he continued to direct special effects for films from other companies, including Toyoko Eiga&#x27;s anti-war film &quot;Listen to the Voices of the Sea&quot;. While slowly rebuilding the company&#x27;s Special Arts Department, he filmed all of the title cards, trailers, and the logo for Toho&#x27;s films from 1950 to 1954. The first production featuring major contributions by Tsuburaya upon his return to Toho was reportedly a 1950 film directed by Hiroshi Inagaki and based on the life of Japanese swordsman Sasaki Kojirō. During this period, Tsuburaya also worked on Toho films such as Senkichi Taniguchi&#x27;s anti-war film &quot;Escape at Dawn&quot; (1950), directed the effects for Taniguchi&#x27;s &#x27;, staged miniature ships to depict a battle in Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s &#x27;, and directed the effects for Kenji Mizoguchi&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Musashino&quot;.

In February 1952, Tsuburaya&#x27;s exile from public office was officially lifted. That same month, Ishirō Honda&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;The Skin of the South&quot;, was released to Japanese theaters. Tsuburaya directed the film&#x27;s effects for the typhoon and landslide scenes, which was his first experience acting as the effects director on a film by the future &quot;Godzilla&quot; director. Tsuburaya collaborated with Honda and producer Tomoyuki Tanaka on &quot;The Man Who Came to Port&quot; later that year: this marked the first time the trio, who are considered the creators of &quot;Godzilla&quot;, ever collaborated with one another.

During World War II, Toho had begun researching 3D films and completed a 3D film process known as &quot;Tovision&quot;. While the project had been abandoned, it was later revived when the 3D film &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; (1952) became a box office hit in the United States. Hence, the company produced its first 3D film, future &quot;Godzilla&quot; co-writer Takeo Murata&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1953). It features cinematography by Tsuburaya, who shot the short film by using an interlocking camera. After the completion of &quot;The Sunday That Jumped Out&quot;, Murata discussed creating a &quot;kaiju&quot; film about a giant whale attacking Tokyo, which Tsuburaya devised the previous year. Tsuburaya, therefore, resubmitted the conception of this production to producer Iwao Mori. Although this project never materialized, elements of it were included in early drafts of &quot;Godzilla&quot; the following year.

Tsuburaya&#x27;s next project, the war epic &quot;Eagle of the Pacific&quot; (1953), was his first significant partnership with Ishirō Honda. As the film featured many effects sequences from &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot;, Tsuburaya used only a small crew to shoot its new effects. Upon its release, the film reportedly became Toho&#x27;s first post-war production to gross over (). The ensuing year, he and Honda collaborated on another war film, &quot;Farewell Rabaul&quot;, released to Japanese theaters in February 1954, to moderate box office success. His effects for this assignment were more advanced than the ones used for &quot;Eagle of the Pacific&quot;, since they featured many more of his technological approaches and syntheses. Because of the success of &quot;Eagle of the Pacific&quot; and &quot;Farewell Rabaul&quot;, Tomoyuki Tanaka believed Tsuburaya should make more &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films with Honda. Tsuburaya&#x27;s next film would become Japan&#x27;s first global hit and gain him international attention.

==== International recognition (1954–1959) ====

After failing to renegotiate with the Indonesian government for the production of &quot;In the Shadow of Glory&quot;, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka began to consider creating a giant monster (or &quot;kaiju&quot;) film, inspired by Eugène Lourié&#x27;s &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (1953) and the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; incident. He believed that it would have considerable potential, due to the financial success of previous monster films and the impact of news generating nuclear fears. As a result, he wrote an outline for the project and pitched it to Iwao Mori. Following Tsuburaya&#x27;s agreement to create its effects, Mori approved the production, eventually titled &quot;Godzilla&quot;, in mid-April 1954; filmmaker Ishirō Honda soon took over the directing duties. During preproduction, Tsuburaya considered using stop motion to depict the titular monster but, as stated by special effects crew member Fumio Nakadai, had to employ the &quot;costume method&quot; because he &quot;finally decided it wouldn&#x27;t work&quot;. This technique is now known as &quot;suitmation&quot;.

Tsuburaya&#x27;s special effects department filmed &quot;Godzilla&quot; in 71 days from August to late October 1954, on a budget of . He and his crew worked relentlessly, regularly starting at 9:00 a.m., preparing at 5:00 p.m., and finishing the shoot at 4 or 5 a.m. in the following morning. Upon its nationwide release on November 3, Tsuburaya&#x27;s effects received critical acclaim and the film became a box office hit. As a result, &quot;Godzilla&quot; established Toho as the most successful effects company in the world, and Tsuburaya obtained his first Japan Technical Award for his efforts.

Instantly after completing &quot;Godzilla&quot; in October, Tsuburaya began working on another Toho-produced science fiction film, &quot;The Invisible Avenger&quot;, which was released to Japanese theaters in December 1954, under the title &quot;Invisible Man&quot;. This &quot;tokusatsu&quot; production was directed by Motoyoshi Oda and featured special effects and photography by Tsuburaya. For the movie, he inherited and expanded the technology used in his first film to feature an invisible character, &quot;The Invisible Man Appears&quot; (1949). Tsuburaya instructed his crew to portray the title character&#x27;s invisibility in various ways throughout the film, including optical synthesis, and suggested that the character would disguise his invisibility powers by dressing up as a clown.
Due to the enormous box-office success of &quot;Godzilla&quot;, Toho quickly gathered the majority of the crew behind the film to create a smaller-budget sequel to the film, entitled &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;: Tsuburaya was officially given the title of special effects director for the first time, having always been credited under &quot;special technique&quot; beforehand. Shot in less than three months, the film was released in April 1955. Just a month later, Tsuburaya began directing the effects of &quot;Half Human&quot;, his second &quot;kaiju&quot; film collaboration with director Ishirō Honda. Among his efforts on this film, the effects director notably created stop-motion animation, rear-screen miniature, and miniature avalanche sequences.

In April 1956, &quot;Godzilla&quot; became the first Japanese film to be widely distributed throughout the United States and was later released worldwide, leading Tsuburaya to gain international recognition. However, for its American release, the movie was re-entitled as &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot;, heavily re-edited, and integrated with new footage featuring Canadian actor Raymond Burr.

Tsuburaya&#x27;s next major undertaking, &quot;The Legend of the White Serpent&quot;, a Hong Kong-Japanese film adaptation of a novel by Fusao Hayashi based on the Chinese legend of the White Snake, was Toho&#x27;s first &quot;tokusatsu&quot; production to be completely filmed in technicolor (via Eastmancolor). In preparation for the film, which was produced on a then-record budget of , Tsuburaya and his unit spent a month training with color process technology before shooting the effects. After working on &quot;The Legend of the White Serpent&quot;, Tsuburaya made the renowned Toho logo, and his unit created the opening credits for most of the company&#x27;s films. Between working on large-scale Toho films, he also created the effects for Nippon TV&#x27;s series &quot;Ninja Arts of Sanada Castle&quot; and several theatrical productions for Tokyo Takarazuka Theater.

Toho&#x27;s next assignment for Tsuburaya was &quot;Rodan&quot;, the first &quot;kaiju&quot; film ever produced in color. About 60% of &quot;Rodan&quot;&#x27;s budget was spent on Tsuburaya&#x27;s effects, which included optical animation, matte paintings, and extremely elaborate miniature sets created to be destroyed or flown over by its namesake monster (played by original &quot;Godzilla&quot; suit actor Haruo Nakajima). &quot;Rodan&quot; required a large number of model sets in a variety of sizes, including 1/10, 1/20, 1/25, and 1/30, to be developed and assembled by Tsuburaya&#x27;s division. The film premiered in Japanese theaters in December 1956 and, upon its release in the United States the following year, earned more at the box office than any previous science fiction film.

&quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; from renowned filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, was Tsuburaya&#x27;s second film release of 1957. Kurosawa cut several scenes by Tsuburaya due to his displeasure with the amount of footage he made for &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;. He next served as the special effects director for &quot;The Mysterians&quot;, a science fiction epic directed by Ishirō Honda. The first color CinemaScope film ever directed by the duo, &quot;The Mysterians&quot; is often called the &quot;definitive science fiction movie&quot;. Tsuburaya won another Japan Technical Award for his widescreen effects in &quot;The Mysterians&quot;.

A new sub-genre for Toho was born with Tsuburaya&#x27;s first movie of 1958, &quot;The H-Man&quot;, which was the first entry in the &quot;Transforming Human Series&quot;. He next directed the effects for Honda&#x27;s &quot;Varan the Unbelievable&quot;, a film about a giant monster awakened in the Tōhoku mountains that surfaces in Tokyo Bay. Initially planned as a made-for-television film, co-produced between Toho and the American company AB-PT Pictures, the production was plagued by numerous difficulties: AB-PT collapsed during production, leading Toho to alter the film&#x27;s status to a theatrical feature. Tsuburaya&#x27;s final film released in 1958 was Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;.

Tsuburaya began 1959 by working on the special effects for &quot;Mighty Atom&quot;, a &quot;tokusatsu&quot; television series based on Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s manga series &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. Although neither he nor his company were credited in the show itself when it aired between March 7, 1959, and May 28, 1960, he supervised the miniature photography done by his staff at Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory. Around the same time, Tsuburaya also directed the special effects for a storm sequence featured in Honda&#x27;s &quot;Inao: Story of an Iron Arm&quot;, for which he also constructed the miniature for the title character&#x27;s rowboat. Next, he worked on &quot;Monkey Sun&quot;, co-written and directed by Kajirō Yamamoto as an all-star remake of his 1940 film &quot;Son Gokū&quot;, a previous entry in the effects director&#x27;s curriculum. Taking inspiration from watching soybean paste in the broth of his wife&#x27;s miso soup, Tsuburaya created scenes with storm clouds, as well as smoke and ash erupting from three volcanoes. His effects for &quot;Monkey Sun&quot; were described by biographer August Ragone as &quot;comical and surreal&quot;.

After operating on the Tokyo Takarazuka Theater production &quot;The Story of Bali&quot;, he directed the effects for Shūe Matsubayashi&#x27;s &quot;Submarine I-57 Will Not Surrender&quot;, his first war film in six years. In order to film submarine scenes for the film, a model seabed terrain was built in the first Toho miniature pool (dubbed the &quot;Small Pool&quot; after a bigger stage was completed). He also filmed his effects for a technicolor version of the film, but they were converted to black-and-white for the final version. In August 1959, Tsuburaya, together with his sons Hajime and Noboru, shot footage of two dragon puppets in Tsuburaya&#x27;s laboratory at their house in Setagaya, Tokyo for a Hong Kong-based film company.
Tsuburaya&#x27;s following significant production, director Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s big-budget religious epic &quot;The Three Treasures&quot;, was created as Toho&#x27;s celebratory thousandth film. Based on legends featured in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, it stars Toshiro Mifune as Yamato Takeru and the &quot;kami&quot; Susanoo. The effects director and his crew shot several key sequences included in the film, such as a battle between Mifune&#x27;s character Susanoo and the eight-headed dragon Yamata no Orochi and an eruption of Mount Fuji. On &quot;The Three Treasures&quot;, Tsuburaya used for the first time the &quot;Toho Versatile Process&quot;, an adaptation of Toho&#x27;s optical printing process that he developed on a budget of for widescreen color films and revealed in May of the same year. The movie earned over , against an initial budget, ranking as Toho&#x27;s highest-grossing film of the year and their second-highest-grossing film altogether. He won the Japan Technical Award for Special Skill and was presented with the Special Achievement Award at Movie Day. While he was pleased with the success of &quot;The Three Treasures&quot;, Tsuburaya became disappointed after seeing a picture of the heads of the Yamata no Orochi prop held up by piano wires in a newspaper article concerning its special effects. Accordingly, he declined an interview with the newspaper because he believed the photograph &quot;broke children&#x27;s dreams&quot;.

When the Space Race erupted between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the late 1950s, Tsuburaya counseled Toho to produce a film about a lunar expedition. Therefore, his next film, &quot;Battle in Outer Space&quot;, was a science fiction epic about a group of astronauts who battle extraterrestrials on the surface of the Moon. Tsuburaya reportedly paid homage to producer George Pal&#x27;s &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1950) in the film&#x27;s Moon landing sequence; he would later meet Pal in Los Angeles in 1962. Since films featuring his contributions were attaining global popularity and praise for Japanese cinema, Hearst filmed Tsuburaya directing the effects for &quot;Battle in Outer Space&quot;, and he later received the Special Award of Merit at the fourth ceremony prior to its release.

==== From &quot;The Secret of the Telegian&quot; to &quot;Chūshingura&quot; (1960–1962) ====

A smaller-scale science fiction film, entitled &quot;The Secret of the Telegian&quot;, which was Toho&#x27;s second installment in the Transforming Human Series, marked Tsuburaya&#x27;s first assignment of 1960. He then took on a project of a much larger extent, &quot;Storm Over the Pacific&quot;, the first-ever war film in color. His department created notably large miniatures for the film, with a 13-meter long miniature being filmed by Tsuburaya on the Miura Coast. &quot;Storm Over the Pacific&quot; was also Toho&#x27;s first film to require the use of the &quot;Big Pool&quot;, which had been completed in February 1960. The pool would later be used in the production of every &quot;Godzilla&quot; film, before being demolished at the end of the filming process for &quot;&quot; (2004). &quot;Storm Over the Pacific&quot; obtained critical acclaim upon its release, with numerous of Tsuburaya&#x27;s effects sequences being later featured in &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), a film by Jack Smight that was also about the Pacific War. Throughout the rest of 1960, Tsuburaya worked on other notable productions, such as the third film in the Transforming Human Series, &quot;The Human Vapor&quot;; he also oversaw the creation of an extremely detailed miniature of Osaka Castle and directed its destruction scene for Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film &quot;The Story of Osaka Castle&quot;, and then directed the tsunami sequence in the film adaptation of Pearl S. Buck&#x27;s 1948 novel &quot;The Big Wave&quot;.
In 1961, Tsuburaya directed the effects for &quot;Mothra&quot;, another &quot;kaiju&quot; film created in collaboration with Ishirō Honda. Allegedly inspired by his own dreams, Tsuburaya created the eponymous giant, moth-like &quot;kaiju&quot;, which would go on to become one of the icons of Japanese fantasy cinema, alongside Godzilla and Rodan, and appear in numerous films thereafter. Though the overall budget for &quot;Mothra&quot; allowed the effects department to create the largest-scale miniature set ever constructed for a Toho production, Tsuburaya was displeased with some of the sequences shot for the film, including some composite cuts of the &quot;Shobijin&quot;. Nonetheless, he decided to keep these scenes upon editing &quot;Mothra&quot; in post-production. The film was released on July 30, 1961, becoming a massive box office hit and, as stated by biographer August Ragone, an &quot;instant classic&quot; alongside Honda and Tsuburaya&#x27;s earlier &quot;kaiju&quot; films &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Rodan&quot;.

After directing blue screen dream scenes with actor Toshiro Mifune for Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s film &#x27; (1961), Tsuburaya moved on to direct the effects for Shūe Matsubayashi&#x27;s epic &quot;tokusatsu&quot; film &quot;The Last War&quot;, which emerged as a major hit upon its October 1961 release, with Tsuburaya&#x27;s effects receiving critical acclaim. The effects director himself would later list &quot;The Last War&quot; as one of his &quot;masterpieces&quot;. Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, assured from the box office success of &quot;Mothra&quot; and &quot;The Last War&quot;, gave Honda and Tsuburaya their greatest budget yet and 300 days to shoot &quot;Gorath&quot;, their next science fiction epic. Although &quot;Gorath&quot; is considered to feature some of Tsuburaya&#x27;s best work as a special effects director, it was a box office failure when it was released in March 1962. On May 15, the director appeared on NK Educational TV&#x27;s program &quot;Japanese Standards&quot;; in July, he finished directing the effects for &#x27;, a South Korean-produced film that was never released in Japan.

After filming &quot;Gorath&quot;, Tsuburaya began planning to work on other projects, such as a new version of &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot;. However, he postponed those as soon as he was given the opportunity to direct the special effects for Honda&#x27;s crossover film &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;. The script&#x27;s early drafts were sent back with notes from Toho asking for the monster antics to be as &quot;funny as possible&quot;; Tsuburaya embraced this approach, seeking to emotionally appeal to children and expand the genre&#x27;s audience. Many of the sequences for the battle between the two monsters were purposefully filled with humorous details, but the approach was not favored by most of the effects crew, who &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe&quot; some of the things Tsuburaya asked them to do, such as Kong and Godzilla volleying a giant boulder back and forth. For their portrayals, Tsuburaya gave Haruo Nakajima (playing Godzilla) and Shoichi Hirose (playing King Kong) freedom to choreograph their own moves. Tsuburaya directed sequences at a miniature outdoor set on the Miura Coast, which depicted the giant octopus&#x27;s attack on the Faro Island village. During its original theatrical release in August 1962, &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; became the second-highest-grossing Japanese film in history and was watched by 11.2 million people, leading it to be regarded as the most-attended film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series.

Tsuburaya&#x27;s final film release of 1962 was Inagaki&#x27;s epic &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film &quot;Chūshingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki&quot;, for which he and his department made forced perspective stages and various optical effects. Produced by Toho—like &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;—in celebration of their 30th anniversary, &quot;Chūshingura&quot; was the company&#x27;s fourth highest-grossing film of the year, and their tenth-highest altogether.

===Birth of a company to last years: 1963–1970===
====Birth of a company and career expansion (1963–1964)====
The first movie released in 1963 to feature Tsuburaya&#x27;s contributions was another war film by Shūe Matsubayashi, &quot;Attack Squadron!&quot;, distributed in January of that year. Despite not being an epic film, unlike Toho&#x27;s previous war movies, &quot;Attack Squadron!&quot; still featured several miniature Japanese and American aircraft, crafted by Tsuburaya&#x27;s crew, with some of the models being controlled via radio control. The sole new miniature battleship built for the film was &quot;Yamato&quot;, an enormous motorized model constructed at 1/15 scale and measuring 17.5 meters (or 57.5 feet).
After visiting Hollywood in order to study the special effects work of major American studios, Tsuburaya founded his own independent company, Tsuburaya Special Effects Productions (later called simply Tsuburaya Productions), on April 12, 1963. It was initially handled entirely by his family: Tsuburaya was reported as its director general and president; his wife Masano was on the director&#x27;s board; his second son Noboru was appointed as accountant. Hajime, Tsuburaya&#x27;s eldest son, would soon join the company as well, leaving his award-winning directorial employment at the Tokyo Broadcasting System. Around August of the same year, photography assistant Kiyoshi Suzuki was hired alongside , a former news cameraman for Kyodo Television. Takano was directly involved in Tsuburaya Productions&#x27; first-ever full-scale &quot;tokusatsu&quot; production, &quot;Alone Across the Pacific&quot; (1963), which required twenty-five effects sequences. Throughout the rest of the year, Tsuburaya worked both for his new company and Toho, where he was still at the helm of the effects department, despite having terminated his exclusive deal with the company.

The second film released in 1963 to feature his contributions was Li Han-hsiang&#x27;s Hong Kong musical film &quot;The Love Eterne&quot;. The effects director was tasked to stage the scene where an earthquake split the tomb of the character Liang Shanbo (played by Ivy Ling Po) in two and the protagonist (played by Betty Loh Ti) ascended into heaven. Cinematographer Tadashi Nishimoto traveled to Japan in order to film Tsuburaya&#x27;s effects at Shintoho&#x27;s . Thereafter, the special effects director moved on to the World War I adventure film &quot;&quot;. In his first partnership with director , Tsuburaya&#x27;s division developed several new models for the film, including large-scale miniatures, full-scale replications of early twentieth-century flying vehicles, and an enormous outdoor model set of Fort Bismarck. According to Ragone, Tsuburaya enjoyed working on this film, despite aiming to make his own tribute feature to Japanese aviation pioneers.

Shortly after completing &quot;The Siege of Fort Bismarck&quot; in April 1963, he began pre-production work on &quot;Matango&quot;, another film created in cooperation with Ishirō Honda, which was the final entry in the Transforming Human Series. In contrast with the majority of Toho&#x27;s previous monster-themed films, the actors were capable of psychical interaction with the suit actors portraying the monsters on a sound stage. said that Tsuburaya &quot;focused&quot; Toho to purchase the &quot;Optical Printer 1900 Series&quot; in order to facilitate the production of special effects, while noting that optical synthesis technology became popular following the film&#x27;s release. A box office failure upon its Japanese release, &quot;Matango&quot; was not included in &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;&#x27;s list of height-grossing films for the year, and has been considered as one of Honda and Tsuburaya&#x27;s most obscure movies ever since, being deemed as a &quot;virtually unknown film&quot;.

Tsuburaya soon moved on to film miniatures and produce optical animation (via his newly purchased Optical Printer 1900 Series) for &quot;The Lost World of Sinbad&quot;. This film, directed by Senkichi Taniguchi from a screenplay by &quot;Mothra&quot; and &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; writer Shinichi Sekizawa, included an acclaimed choreographed chase sequence between a wizard and a witch, created via animation and matte photography, which gained Tsuburaya another Japan Technical Award for Special Skill.
Tsuburaya almost immediately started to work on another Honda-directed science fiction &quot;tokusatsu&quot; movie, &quot;Atragon&quot; (1963). Based on Shunrō Oshikawa&#x27;s novel &quot;The Undersea Warship&quot; and incorporated with Shigeru Komatsuzaki&#x27;s novel &quot;Undersea Empire&quot;, the film concerns a group of former colleagues, friends, and family that must convince the captain of the battleship &quot;Gotengo&quot;, Hachiro Jinguji (played by Jun Tazaki), to use his battleship to save the world from the invading ancient undersea civilization of Mu, who are using their advanced technology and their guardian sea dragon, Manda, in an attempt to take over the surface world. Since Toho aimed to distribute the film in Japanese theaters on December 22 of that year, Tsuburaya was given roughly two months to shoot the effects sequences for &quot;Atragon&quot;. As a result, in order to achieve the company&#x27;s goal, he separated his special effects team into two units, assuring that it would allow him to complete the assignment as soon as possible. Although it was quickly converted and developed, the film is regarded as &quot;one of the cornerstones of Japanese cinema&quot; and is still often referenced in media.

While working on &quot;Atragon&quot;, Tsuburaya was also concluding model effects for the Hiroshi Inagaki-directed &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film, &quot;Whirlwind&quot; (1964). During this period of time, lack of sleep and workload-related stress were taking a toll on Tsuburaya&#x27;s health, so much that he was often found sleeping in his chair during scene set-ups for his effects shoots.

The fourth installment in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie series, &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; (1964), was Tsuburaya&#x27;s next project. Often regarded as the best &quot;kaiju&quot; film to feature his works, it was produced in celebration of the tenth-anniversary of Toho&#x27;s &quot;kaiju&quot; films and depicts the battle between Godzilla and the title character of the 1961 film &quot;Mothra&quot;. Tsuburaya utilized his 1900 optical printer to remove damage in composite photographs for the picture and create Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath; he also went on location to shoot some composite plates of Nagoya Castle for the scene where Godzilla destroyed the building. Since &quot;Godzilla&quot; actor Haruo Nakajima could not destroy the castle&#x27;s model entirely, as originally planned, Tsuburaya first attempted to salvage the shot by making Godzilla seem enraged by the castle&#x27;s strong fortification, before eventually choosing to re-shoot the scene with a more fragile model. He also went on location to shoot a segment featuring the United States Navy discharging missiles at Godzilla: this scene was included in the movie&#x27;s version for the U.S. market, whereas it was omitted from the original Japanese version. This was one of the rare occasions when a sequence featuring Godzilla was shot outside Toho Studios.

====Japanese-American coproductions and &quot;Ultra Q&quot; (1964–1965)====

In the spring of 1964, Tsuburaya received a visit from frequent collaborator Ishirō Honda on the Hawaiian Island of Kauai. The effects director was shooting a dogfight and plane crash sequence for Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;None but the Brave&quot; (released in 1965), the renowned singer and actor&#x27;s sole directorial picture. As the first major Japanese-American co-production, the epic anti-war film revolved around a troop of American soldiers, stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during World War II, who are forced to collaborate with an opposition Japanese unit that has also been stranded on the same island. During Honda&#x27;s visit, Tsuburaya told him he was working on his first television series for Tsuburaya Productions, then-titled &quot;Unbalance,&quot; but was struggling to find a lead actor for it. Honda convinced Kenji Sahara (who starred in &quot;None but the Brave&quot; and several Honda-Tsuburaya &quot;kaiju&quot; films) to play the team leader for the intended show, which would later become &quot;Ultra Q&quot; (1966). &quot;None but the Brave&quot; was later released in Japan by Toho on January 15, 1965, and was distributed by Warner Bros. in the U.S. the following month.

In January 1964, while in New York, Tsuburaya ordered Oxberry&#x27;s 1200 optical printer, a model that at the time was owned by only one other studio in the entire world: Disney. Despite having to spend a then-record fee, Tsuburaya wanted to purchase the new printer for Tsuburaya Productions because it was one of the most adaptable post-production tools: moreover, he had used Oxberry&#x27;s previous iteration of the device on films such as &quot;Matango&quot;. He went on to operate this technology on &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, Tsuburaya Productions&#x27; first television series, which was a combination of two of his previously discarded projects, tentatively titled &quot;Unbalance&quot; and &quot;WoO&quot;. Principal photography on &quot;Ultra Q&quot; began on September 27, 1964, with the shooting of the episode &quot;Mammoth Flower&quot;. Airing on the Tokyo Broadcasting System from January 2 to July 3, 1966, the series follows the adventures of a trio who investigates strange phenomena, ranging from supernatural threats to &quot;kaiju&quot;, in the 20th century. Upon broadcast, around 30% of Japanese households with televisions watched the show, making Tsuburaya a household name and gaining him even more attention from the media, who dubbed him the &quot;God of &quot;Tokusatsu&quot;&quot;.

After directing the effects on Honda&#x27;s &quot;kaiju&quot; film &quot;Dogora&quot; (released in August 1964), Tsuburaya renewed their collaboration for the &quot;kaiju&quot; film, &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, making 1964 the only time two &quot;Godzilla&quot; movies were ever released in the same year (the first one being &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot;). Conceived as one of the features celebrating ten years of Toho&#x27;s &quot;kaiju&quot; films, &quot;Ghidorah&quot; featured a dragon &quot;kaiju&quot; designed as an homage to Yamata no Orochi, King Ghidorah, who opposed Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra in the film. Tsuburaya and Toho executives decided to anthropomorphize the monsters for the film, despite Honda feeling &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with the decision and being reluctant to use The Peanuts (who previously played Mothra&#x27;s fairies in the namesake film) as the interpreters for the &quot;kaiju&quot; in the summit scene. Released on December 20, 1964, &quot;Ghidorah&quot; was a massive box office hit, grossing , relatively more than &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;, the series&#x27; previous record holder. King Ghidorah would go on to become a frequent antagonist of the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise.

Tsuburaya began 1965 by directing the effects for Seiji Maruyama&#x27;s war film &quot;Retreat from Kiska&quot;. Tsuburaya spent two months filming the scene where the fleet circles Kiska Island in thick fog on an indoor stage set since the fog could not be controlled by the wind during open shooting. The sequence where the fleet slips through the rocks was realized by laying a rail at the bottom of the special effects pool and running the warship&#x27;s miniature on it. The miniatures could not be very large for on-set shooting, and the water flow was pumped to adjust the proportions of the waves and wakes. A large outdoor pool is used in the scene of port entry and departure without fog. For his work on &quot;Kiska&quot;, Tsuburaya won a Japan Technical Award for Special Skill at the 19th Japan Technical Awards.
His next production, &quot;Frankenstein vs. Baragon&quot; (1965), depicted Frankenstein&#x27;s monster fighting a new subterranean &quot;kaiju&quot;, named Baragon in Japan. Tsuburaya was reportedly enthusiastic about working on the film because the titular monsters were going to be smaller than normal, allowing his team to build larger model sets than the ones used in &quot;Godzilla&quot; movies: plus, an actor in make-up—Kōji Furuhata—would be involved to play Frankenstein, rather than leaving the role to a stuntman in a monster suit. In spite of featuring model sets among the biggest and most detailed models for a Honda-Tsuburaya collaboration, some critics have questioned several of Tsuburaya&#x27;s ideas, including a puppet used to portray a horse, instead of an actual equine, for a sequence in which Baragon overruns a farmstead. According to Koichi Takano, Tsuburaya said that he used the puppet because it was &quot;more fun&quot;. Tsuburaya also made a scene depicting the atomic bomb falling upon Hiroshima, which Honda biographers Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski called an &quot;impressionistic display of smoke and fire&quot;.

After post-production on the film was finalized for its Japanese release, held two days after the twentieth anniversary of the Hiroshima atomic bombing (August 8, 1965), American co-producer Henry G. Saperstein asked for Toho to film a new ending for the U.S. version: Tsuburaya and Honda, accordingly, re-assembled the cast and crew to shoot the new ending, although it was eventually left unused in both American and Japanese iterations of the motion picture. Still, the alternative ending was later screened at a fan convention in 1982, before featuring as a bonus scene on home video.

Following &quot;Frankenstein vs. Baragon&quot;, Tsuburaya quickly moved on to his next film, Kengo Furusawa&#x27;s &quot;The Crazy Adventure&quot;, produced in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Crazy Cats comedy group. Inspired by popular spy films of the time, Tsuburaya&#x27;s department extensively used &quot;wire action&quot; in outdoor locations, while lead actor Hitoshi Ueki performed most of the movie&#x27;s action sequences without any stunts. Tsuburaya also directed miniature effects sequences for the film. Released in Japan on October 31, 1965, &quot;The Crazy Adventure&quot; was another box office hit for Tsuburaya, earning even more than &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;.
Then, Tsuburaya worked on Honda&#x27;s &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; (1965), the sixth film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise and Shōwa period, as well as the second collaboration between Toho and UPA. A direct sequel to &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, the movie focuses on two astronauts who land on a planet occupied by an alien race, known as the &quot;Xiliens&quot;, as they ask humanity for assistance with Godzilla and Rodan in defeating the &quot;intruder&quot; King Ghidorah. After bringing the astronauts, scientist Sakurai, Godzilla, and Rodan to their planet, the aliens attempt to exploit Ghidorah, Godzilla, and Rodan to conquer the Earth by mind-controlling them. The last &quot;Godzilla&quot; film to feature the contributions of Tsuburaya&#x27;s entire effects unit, &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; notably features Godzilla&#x27;s renowned victory dance, which derived from the &quot;shie!&quot; dance featured in Fujio Akatsuka&#x27;s comedy manga series &quot;Osomatsu-kun&quot; (1962–1969), a popular culture sensation at the time of the film&#x27;s production. The dance was included in the film after a Toho employee suggested it to Tsuburaya, who was already supportive of anthropomorphizing monster characters with comical characteristics. For his work on &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot;, the director obtained the Japan Technical Award for Special Skill the following year.

====&quot;Ultraman&quot; and beyond (1966–1967)====
At the height of &quot;Ultra Q&quot;&#x27;s popularity, TBS aired &quot;The Father of &quot;Ultra Q&quot;&quot;, an episode of their documentary series &quot;Modern Leaders&quot;, on June 2, 1966. Throughout the episode, Tsuburaya was filmed at work and elsewhere, being even interviewed by individuals dressed in &quot;Ultra Q&quot; monster costumes: in this instance, he mentioned for the first time that he was working on a new show to follow &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, which later turned out to be &quot;Ultraman&quot;.

Tsuburaya had begun working on the new &quot;tokusatsu&quot; series in the autumn of the previous year: TBS executives wanted to produce a series as thriving as &quot;Ultra Q&quot; and wanted a full-color program that would &quot;take the monster line to the next level&quot;. Tsuburaya and writer Tetsuo Kinjō decided to take the barebones concept of &quot;Ultra Q&quot; about civilians and scientists haggling monsters: they came up with the idea of a group, tentatively named the &quot;Scientific Investigation Agency&quot; (SIA), formed to deal with &quot;kaiju&quot; and supernatural phenomena as the focus of the new show. The pair also agreed to add unused conceptions from &quot;Ultra Q&quot; and &quot;WoO&quot;. Tsuburaya had spent significant amounts of studio money to build his models for the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, so TBS aimed to monetize these miniatures and was looking for a task that could repurpose the sets and suits from the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise.
During designing, Tsuburaya found the original versions of title character&#x27;s design to be &quot;too alien and sinister&quot;, and requested production designer Tohl Narita to keep drafting additional designs as teleplays were being written concurrently. Narita chose to root Ultraman&#x27;s design in the Greek concept of &quot;cosmos&quot; (order and harmony), in contrast to his previous designs for &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, which had been inspired by the concept of &quot;khaos&quot;. Tsuburaya provided input on Narita&#x27;s designs, with some being inspired by the art of Miyamoto Musashi. Ultraman&#x27;s silver skin symbolized steel from an interstellar rocket, while the red lining represented the surface of Mars. As stated by biographer August Ragone, Ultraman became Tsuburaya&#x27;s &quot;most popular and enduring creation&quot;.

The filming sessions for &quot;Ultraman&quot; began in March 1966, and the crew was divided into three separate groups for its live-action and special effects. Tsuburaya Productions and TBS initially planned to start broadcasting the series on July 17, 1966, but the latter company chose to release it the week before. Tsuburaya supervised the production of every episode of the series and served as the &quot;de facto&quot; special effects director for episodes 18 and 19.

After a few meetings between the two companies and sponsors, it was decided that a pilot episode, originally planned as the &quot;Ultraman Eve Festival&quot;, would introduce the show&#x27;s title character. The pilot episode was aired on July 10—one of the dates that have been cited as Tsuburaya&#x27;s birthday— of that same year, under the title &quot;The Birth of Ultraman: An Ultraman Premiere Celebration&quot;. &quot;Ultraman&quot; became a larger hit than its predecessor, obtaining a 40% viewership. With monsters now available to watch at home weekly, children fewer asked their parents to take them to the theater: consequently, Tsuburaya Productions&#x27; triumph in television was diverting box-office money from Toho&#x27;s &quot;kaiju&quot; films.

Also in 1966, Tsuburaya worked once again with Honda for the &quot;kaiju film The War of the Gargantuas&quot;, produced in collaboration with Henry G. Saperstein, which centered on scientists investigating the appearance of two giant hairy humanoids who eventually fight each other in Tokyo. Initially drafted as a sequel to &quot;Frankenstein vs. Baragon&quot;, the film went through several tentative titles during scripting, and the final film was referred to by film chronicler Stuart Galbraith IV as a &quot;quasi–sequel&quot; to its predecessor. The film premiered in Japan in July 1966.

After Tsuburaya&#x27;s series &quot;Booska the Friendly Beast&quot; began airing on television in November 1966, he received his last credit as &quot;special effects director&quot; on a &quot;Godzilla&quot; film for &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot;. However, his disciple actually served as a &quot;de facto&quot; special effects director for this film, with Tsuburaya&#x27;s credit being merely ceremonial. The following year, Tsuburaya directed the effects for &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;, a Japanese-American co-production created to celebrate Toho&#x27;s thirty-fifth anniversary. In homage to the dinosaur fighting scene from &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), the director introduced Gorosaurus, a dinosaurian &quot;kaiju&quot; that battles Kong on Mondo Island in the film. The ensuing 1967 release featuring Tsuburaya&#x27;s contributions was &quot;Ultraseven&quot;, the third entry in the &quot;Ultra&quot; series, which had been influenced by the British TV series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. The series received a 33.7% rating upon beginning airing on October 7, 1967. Also in 1967, he was appointed &quot;special effects supervisor&quot; and handed over the position of special effects director for the &quot;Godzilla&quot; film series to Arikawa, starting with &quot;Son of Godzilla&quot;.

====Final works, last years, and death (1968–1970)====
In 1967, Tsuburaya Productions&#x27; writing crew took elements from Shinichi Sekizawa&#x27;s screenplay, &quot;The Flying Battleship&quot;, and inserted concepts from it into a TV series, &quot;Mighty Jack,&quot; which was similar in concept to &quot;James Bond&quot; and &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. Concerning a team of secret agents established by a prosperous industrialist to oppose the acts of a military organization, referred to as &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Mighty Jack&quot; was aimed at a more mature audience, in contrary to the &quot;Ultra&quot; series and &quot;Booska the Friendly Beast&quot;. Due to pressure from Fuji TV, the series declined rapidly after the release of its first episode on April 6, 1968, as a consequence of its poor quality: many teleplays were filmed without revision, effects work frequently lacked time, and reshoots were often unattainable. Fuji TV considered the series as a commercial failure, due to its 8.3% audience rating, and they canceled it after Tsuburaya Productions had finished producing just 13 of the scheduled 26 episodes. A sequel to the series, titled &quot;Fight! Mighty Jack&quot;, later began broadcasting in July 1968.

With budgets rising, less returning crew, and theatergoers being dragged away by television, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka chose to conclude the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series but offered one last film for the original staff. Honda&#x27;s consequential &quot;kaiju&quot; epic, &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; (1968), featured effects directed by Sadamasa Arikawa, which Tsuburaya allegedly supervised. His next release of that year was another Seiji Maruyama&#x27;s war epic, &quot;Admiral Yamamoto&quot;, which starred Toshiro Mifune as Imperial Japanese Navy Marshal Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (who was previously the topic of Honda and Tsuburaya&#x27;s &quot;Eagle of the Pacific&quot;). &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; was the twelfth-highest grossing domestic film of 1968, registering an approximately -worth gain, while &quot;Admiral Yamamoto&quot; was the second-highest grosser, at roughly . On September 15, 1968, the week after the final episode of &quot;Ultraseven&quot; was broadcast and just over a month after &quot;Admiral Yamamoto&quot; was distributed to Japanese theaters by Toho, the director&#x27;s following project for Tsuburaya Productions, &quot;&quot;, began airing on the TBS, where he served as the show&#x27;s supervisor.

&quot;Latitude Zero&quot;, released by Toho in July 1969, was a Japanese-American collaboration produced by Toho and Don Sharp Productions. The production was reported to have had a budget of (equivalent to about ), but Tsuburaya&#x27;s department had difficulty making realistic creatures for the picture after its American producer pulled out of the project. In comparison, retrospective writers have praised Tsuburaya&#x27;s model work, especially his submarines, which Ryfle and Godziszewski noted resembled &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; machines in Gerry Anderson&#x27;s show of the same name. Like Honda and Tsuburaya&#x27;s previous effort, &quot;Latitude Zero&quot; only grossed (), making it a box office failure.

Tsuburaya quickly moved on to his next project, &quot;Battle of the Japan Sea&quot;, regarded as the third film in the &quot;Toho 8.15 series&quot; (following &quot;Japan&#x27;s Longest Day&quot; and &quot;Admiral Yamamoto&quot;). Tsuburaya was provided with his largest budget ever for the Seiji Maruyama-directed war epic film about the Russo-Japanese War. Thus, 60 members of his department&#x27;s artists created an estimated 107 ship miniatures for the film and constructed a 13-meter model replica of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s battleship &quot;Mikasa,&quot; in contrast to the other 3-meter ships. Released in August 1969, &quot;Battle of the Japan Sea&quot; was the second highest Japanese grosser of 1969, earning against its budget. Deemed one of Tsuburaya&#x27;s masterpieces, &quot;Battle of the Japan Sea&quot; was the last production he officially took part in as the special effects director. On the same month, Tsuburaya Productions&#x27; next series, &quot;Horror Theater Unbalance&quot; (aired in 1973), entered the production process: Tsuburaya was credited as its supervisor.

Tsuburaya and several of Toho&#x27;s effects crew members spent the majority of 1969 working together to create &quot;Birth of the Japanese Islands&quot;, an audiovisual exhibit simulating earthquakes and volcanoes, which was set to be part of Mitsubishi&#x27;s pavilion at the Expo &#x27;70 in Suita, Osaka Prefecture. His commitment to the project prevented him from being involved in the production of &quot;All Monsters Attack&quot; (1969), and director Honda handled special effects instead of him for the first time. Nonetheless, the director stated that Tsuburaya was &quot;personally involved with the editing,&quot; adding: &quot;The film may have been generally put together [by others], but he definitely looked it over and instructed the staff to shorten certain scenes, and so on.&quot;
Ignoring his doctor&#x27;s recent advice to reduce his workload due to declining health, Tsuburaya started displaying symptoms of unstable angina, and he collapsed while visiting the Naruto whirlpools during the shooting sessions for the Expo &#x27;70 film presentation. He was subsequently sent to in Meguro to continue his recovery, but refused to remain there, as he expected to complete &quot;Birth of the Japanese Islands&quot; on schedule: instead, he accepted an offer to recover and receive medical treatment at Ukiyama Villa on the Izu Peninsula in Itō, Shizuoka, where he was instructed to cancel any assignments. Concerned about Tsuburaya&#x27;s future, his son Hajime quit his job at TBS and officially took over his father&#x27;s position as the president of Tsuburaya Productions on November 30, 1969.

In December 1969, Tsuburaya completed filming the Expo &#x27;70 project and moved to his Ukiyama Villa with his wife Masano, where he persisted in writing his autobiography and the film outlines &quot;Japan Airplane Guy&quot; and &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot;. While continuing to write the &quot;Japan Airplane Guy&quot; story treatment daily, he expressed his desire to work on more projects in the future and return to Tokyo on January 26, 1970. However, on January 25, 1970, at 10:15 P.M., Masano awoke and discovered that Tsuburaya had died while sleeping with her at the villa in Itō, Shizuoka: he was 68 years old. Japanese sources have cited the cause of his death as angina associated with an asthma attack.

On January 27, a mourning tradition took place at the Tsuburaya family&#x27;s house. His funeral was held at the Seijō Catholic Church on January 29, with his eldest son Hajime serving as the chief mourner. The following day, he was posthumously awarded the Honorary Chairman Award by the Japanese Society of Cinematographers and the Order of the Sacred Treasure by Emperor Hirohito. A Catholic service was held at Toho Studios on February 2, with &quot;The Last War&quot; producer Sanezumi Fujimoto providing the services. Five hundred friends and colleagues attended the service, including actor Kazuo Hasegawa, &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot; director Kajirō Yamamoto, &quot;The Three Treasures&quot; director Hiroshi Inagaki, and &quot;A Thousand and One Nights with Toho&quot; director Kon Ichikawa. He was later entombed at the Catholic Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo, Japan.

==Filmmaking==
===Style, themes, and techniques===

Tsuburaya&#x27;s career in film production evolved from small-scale &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films to financially successful war and science fiction epics. During his stint as a cinematographer in the early 20th century, Tsuburaya closely researched international cinema in order to incorporate some of the techniques and improve his innovative style; some of these films include: &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925), &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), and &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). Tsuburaya remarked that &quot;King Kong&quot; heavily influenced him to work in special effects. He decided to create special effects sequences in films by using miniature effects and synthesis technology involving layered film strips. Tsuburaya constantly converted new special effects techniques and tested them on a daily basis and became the founder and head of Japanese special effects (known as &quot;Tokusatsu&quot;), earning him the title &quot;Father of &quot;Tokusatsu&quot;&quot;. Biographer August Ragone writes that his footage, which was always filmed live on a soundstage, in comparison to modern techniques such as computer-generated imagery, could be &quot;silly or deadly, beautiful or terrifying, but no matter how fanciful or fantastic, his visual effects seem to live and breathe with a life of their own.&quot;

For &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954), Tsuburaya decided to create a new suit acting technique, later known as &quot;suitmation&quot;, because the film&#x27;s small budget and tight schedule restrained him from portraying Godzilla via stop motion (à la &quot;King Kong&quot;). Film historian Steve Ryfle writes that, although suitmation was not as elaborate as the stop motion techniques by effects pioneers Willis H. O&#x27;Brien (creator of the effects in &quot;King Kong&quot;) and Ray Harryhausen (creator of the effects in &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;), it gave the special effects director a more effective approach to depict the destruction sequences that made Godzilla famous.

Tsuburaya&#x27;s endeavors in films often depicted nuclear holocausts, world wars, monster invasions, and intergalactic conflicts. Despite his movies featuring these apocalyptic and mass destructive themes, he opposed including themes of graphic violence—especially bleeding and slaughter—in his &quot;kaiju&quot; films, believing it was inappropriate for the younger members of the audience. However, Toho executives (such as Iwao Mori) urged Tsuburaya to feature gore in his &quot;kaiju&quot; films during the late 1960s, due to the rise in popularity of juvenile-targeted television shows that featured an increase in violent content, with even Tsuburaya&#x27;s own shows &quot;Ultraman&quot; and &quot;Ultraseven&quot; depicting heroes decapitating, slashing, chopping, or otherwise injuring their monster adversaries. According to his protégé Teruyoshi Nakano, Tsuburaya told Toho executives: &quot;These movies are for kids. It&#x27;s nonsense. Why do you enjoy showing them blood?&quot; Rather than have violent themes in his films, Tsuburaya continually employed lighthearted comedy and humanism in his &quot;tokusatsu&quot; work. As written by Ryfle, it is implied that this is due to him still being a &quot;child at heart&quot; and having a &quot;soft spot in his heart for children&quot; during his late life. In 1962, Tsuburaya explained: &quot;My heart and mind are as they were when I was a child. Then I loved to play with toys and to read stories of magic. I still do. My wish is only to make life happier and more beautiful for those who will go and see my films of fantasy.&quot; His compassion for children helped shape his legacy; notably, the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films produced after his death, featuring effects by Nakano, displayed large amounts of graphic violence.

===Relationship with cast and crew===

According to Ishirō Honda biographers Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski, it was challenging to cooperate with Tsuburaya, especially for directors. Tsuburaya refused to surrender control of his sector to the mainstream director: he refused to allow directors to stare into the viewfinder in case they assessed elements like the set or camera position and opposed when his footage was re-edited. During the production of &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954), however, Tsuburaya formed a bond with Honda, who had a completely different personality, being deemed as calm and courteous, rarely expressing his emotions towards others. Ryfle and Godziszewski stated that the two infrequently interacted outside Toho Studios and were not personal comrades, but nevertheless shared a &quot;&quot;tsu-ka&quot; relationship&quot;. Honda&#x27;s assistant director Kōji Kajita said that &quot;Other directors such as Hiroshi Inagaki, Jun Fukuda, and Shūe Matsubayashi also worked with Mr. Tsuburaya, but they were all the &#x27;me-first&#x27; type and they really didn&#x27;t work well together. Directors tend to think they are number one, and the effects team should just follow behind. Mr. Tsuburaya didn&#x27;t appreciate that. Honda-&quot;san&quot; and Mr. Tsuburaya got along so well because they were both very mature men.&quot;

Despite often making unrelenting directions on his crew, Tsuburaya was admired by colleagues, many of whom were younger than him and called him an &quot;uncle&quot;, mentor, or the &quot;Old Man&quot;. Godzilla suit actor Haruo Nakajima remarked that although Tsuburaya was usually smiling and had a refreshing disposition onset, he was often angry with the staff. Special effects cinematographer Tomioka Mototaka claimed he was in a position to be scolded by Tsuburaya against cinematographer Sadamasa Arikawa; photography assistants Takao Tsurumi and Mitsuru Chokai testified that Tsuburaya did not get angry directly when young individuals in his unit failed, but scolded Arikawa and others, instead.

On the contrary, Tsuburaya was rarely infuriated by actors. In an interview regarding August Ragone&#x27;s biography on Tsuburaya, Nakajima said he was a &quot;very reserved man on the set. Most of the direction he gave me for the performances was, &#x27;I trust you to do it. Do what you feel is best, I&#x27;ll leave it up to you.&#x27; And that&#x27;s the way he was for most of the films we worked on together after &quot;Godzilla&quot;.&quot; He added: &quot;After the wires broke on the Rodan suit, causing me to fall several meters onto the miniature set, he chided, &#x27;It&#x27;s good that you didn&#x27;t die; because I need you to finish the film.&#x27;&quot; In an interview regarding &quot;Nezura 1964&quot; (2020), Ultraman suit actor Bin Furuya remarked that Tsuburaya was &quot;usually a normal kind person&quot; and always encouraged his actors to &quot;act as if they were in the kind of film that would give dreams to children&quot;.

===Production and editing===
Tsuburaya had several methods to shoot his films. During his stint as a cinematographer, he was the first to use crane shooting and key light prior to World War II. According to camera operator Mitsuo Miura, Tsuburaya also filmed &quot;pseudo nightscapes&quot; using beer bottle fragments as a filter, and his disciple Sadamasa Arikawa became the first photographer in Japan to shoot with color filters. During his late life, Tsuburaya explained to cinematographer Tomioka that he had always recognized how many frames could be taken with a hand-cranked camera, and he was able to turn it instinctively.

Honda said that Tsuburaya&#x27;s approach to film special effects was &quot;like a physics experiment, no different than trying to make new discoveries.&quot; Tsuburaya&#x27;s lighting engineer Kaoru Saitō remarked that his camera work in special effects only moved sideways or moves up and down with a crane once the main position is decided, and the camera itself does not approach forward. Saitō also testified that he demanded the subject approach the camera and never shot the set from the other side of the camera.

When he brainstormed ideas for a new film, Tsuburaya was known for his quiet but intense style. Nakano stated: &quot;I heard about this episode when Mr. Tsuburaya was returning home from work one day and he ran into this woman who kind of looked familiar to him. So he said, &#x27;Hello, it&#x27;s been a long time.&#x27; Do you know who that woman was? It was his wife! Mr. Tsuburaya was so deep into his own thoughts, he kind of lost himself sometimes.&quot;

According to Arikawa, Tsuburaya also edited his own film work. Tsuburaya&#x27;s assistant director, Masakatsu Asai, stated that he memorized the situation and storage location of the cuts he shot. Scripter Keiko Suzuki said Tsuburaya envisioned his own editing plan, and he often filmed scenes unscripted. Thus, for instance, scenes were altered from &quot;Battle 1&quot; to &quot;Aerial Battle 2&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Cultural impact===

In spite of his death, Tsuburaya&#x27;s name and work remained prominent because his &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films and television shows generated a global fandom. A year after his death, Tsuburaya&#x27;s intent to revitalize &quot;Ultraman&quot; was eventuated into &quot;Return of Ultraman&quot; (1971-1972), which launched a new string of the &quot;Ultra&quot; series throughout the rest of the decade. Despite having difficulty after their father&#x27;s passing, Hajime, Noboru, and Akira kept running Tsuburaya Productions and never gave up his legacy, even when Tsuburaya Productions only had just three employees before the home video revived the &quot;Ultraman&quot; series. In 1989, Noboru declared that Ultraman is his father&#x27;s &quot;most important legacy&quot; even if Godzilla is Tsuburaya&#x27;s most popular character overseas.

Contemporary writers have frequently stated that Tsuburaya is one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema, with biographer August Ragone claiming that Tsuburaya&#x27;s cinematic importance is on par with Akira Kurosawa. &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s Doug Bolton wrote that even &quot;people not familiar with Japanese science fiction will easily recognise the legacy of Tsuburaya&#x27;s work&quot;. &quot;The Tokusatsu Network&quot; said that Tsuburaya was &quot;possibly the most influential figure in the Japanese film industry&quot; and stated that his legacy &quot;lives on to this day through his creations and has had a large enough impact for him to be compared to Walt Disney.&quot;

Numerous people in the entertainment industry have spoken of their appreciation for Tsuburaya&#x27;s work or cited it as an inspiration on their own work, including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt, Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick, John Carpenter, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hideaki Anno, Will Smith, Chris Kirkpatrick, Guillermo del Toro, Shinji Higuchi, Shunji Iwai, Kazuo Miyagawa, and &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; creator Hajime Isayama. During the early 1970s, Lucas visited Toho when looking for a company to produce the special effects for &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) since Tsuburaya had established the company as a powerhouse for producing special effects. Spielberg stated that Tsuburaya&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; was the &quot;most masterful of all the dinosaur movies, because it made you believe that it was really happening.&quot; His work has also been cited as the inspiration for the music video of Beastie Boys&#x27; song &quot;Intergalactic&quot;, the series &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and the film &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;, among other projects.

===Tributes===
Tsuburaya had intended to work on Honda&#x27;s &quot;Space Amoeba&quot; (1970), but he died shortly after filming began. While the film was completed in Tsuburaya&#x27;s honor and was his last project to be involved in, Toho executives refused to grant him a dedication in its opening credits.

A script for a project entitled &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot; was written by Tsuburaya shortly before he died in Izu. Motivated by his father&#x27;s desire to work on another adaptation of the tale, Hajime Tsubruaya attempted to produce &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot; into a film for Tsuburaya Productions&#x27; 10th anniversary. In the preface of Hiroyasu Yamaura&#x27;s script for the film, Hajime said he had taken &quot;great pains to incorporate the strengths of various folk tales and fairy tales into a work that children around the world would honestly enjoy&quot;. Despite his tireless efforts, he died on the morning of February 9, 1973, before director Yoshiyuki Kuroda was scheduled to begin production that evening. Thus, production on the project was canceled. In 1987, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka turned Eiji Tsuburaya&#x27;s lifelong ambition into a live-action movie titled &quot;Princess from the Moon&quot;, which featured effects directed by Tsuburaya&#x27;s protégé Teruyoshi Nakano.

In 2001, two toy companies distributed figures of Tsuburaya in honor of the 100th anniversary of his birth. In celebration of the 114th anniversary of his birth, Google artist Jennifer Hom and her colleagues made an animated doodle of his work in special effects on July 7, 2015. The doodle allowed users to create a scene from one of Tsuburaya&#x27;s key monster movies and television shows.

On January 11, 2019, after construction over a period of five years, the Eiji Tsuburaya Museum opened in his hometown of Sukagawa, a tribute to his life and work in film and television. During the museum&#x27;s opening ceremony, Mayor Katsuya Hashimoto stated that the museum is &quot;an archival center that will disseminate Japanese special effects to the world.&quot; Later that year, filmmaker Minoru Kawasaki began filming &quot;Monster Seafood Wars&quot;, a &quot;kaiju&quot; film loosely based on his unmade film prior to production of &quot;Godzilla&quot; about a giant octopus that attacked Tokyo.

In commemoration of 120 years since his birth, the National Film Archive of Japan held a celebratory event in Sukagawa in cooperation with Tsuburaya Productions from August to November 2021. In September 2021, the first screening of &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot; since its original 1935 release was held at the event (However, it was in shortened form since the original print is still believed to be lost).

On July 10, 2022, a screening of &quot;Shin Ultraman&quot; (2022) was held at the City Cultural Center in Sukagawa as a tribute to Tsuburaya and his series &quot;Ultraman&quot; (1966-1967), on which the film was based. The screening was attended by an estimated 950 people, with &quot;Shin Ultraman&quot; director Shinji Higuchi and star Takumi Saitoh discussing the legacy of Tsuburaya&#x27;s work afterward.

Filmmaker and visual effects artist Takashi Yamazaki paid homage to Tsuburaya&#x27;s work in his acclaimed 2023 film &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;.

===Portrayals===
Many actors have played Tsuburaya in television dramas and programs. For his portrayal in the 1989 television drama &#x27;, an unidentified renowned Toho actor who had been starring in many of the company&#x27;s box office hits since before &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954) was initially cast as Tsuburaya. However, the famed actor declined the offer, believing he lacked resemblance in appearance to Tsuburaya and therefore was replaced by actor Kō Nishimura. In 1993, filmmaker Seijun Suzuki played Tsuburaya in the television drama &#x27;. For &quot;&quot;, a 2022 television documentary on the two screenwriters behind &quot;Ultraman&quot;, he was portrayed by .

<text>Nancy Witcher Astor, Viscountess Astor (19 May 1879 – 2 May 1964) was an American-born British politician who was the first woman seated as a Member of Parliament (MP), serving from 1919 to 1945. Astor was born in Danville, Virginia and raised in Greenwood, Virginia. Her first marriage, to socialite Robert Gould Shaw II, was unhappy and ended in divorce. She then moved to England and married American-born Englishman Waldorf Astor in 1906.

After her second husband succeeded to the peerage and entered the House of Lords, she entered politics as a member of the Unionist Party (now the Conservative Party) and, at the by-election caused by his elevation, won his former seat of Plymouth Sutton in 1919, becoming the first woman to sit as an MP in the House of Commons. During her time in Parliament, Astor was an advocate for temperance, welfare, education reform and women&#x27;s rights. She was also an ardent anti-Catholic and anti-communist, and received criticism for her antisemitism and sympathetic view of Nazism.

Astor served in Parliament until 1945 when she was persuaded to step down, as her outspokenness had made her a political liability in the final years of the Second World War. She retired from politics and largely withdrew from public life following the death of her husband. Astor died in 1964 at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire and was interred at her family estate at Cliveden.

== Early life ==
Nancy Witcher Langhorne was born at the Langhorne House in Danville, Virginia. She was the eighth of eleven children born to railroad businessman Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and Nancy Witcher Keene. Following the abolition of slavery, Chiswell struggled to make his operations profitable, and with the destruction of the war, the family lived in near-poverty for several years before Nancy was born. After her birth, her father gained a job as a tobacco auctioneer in Danville, the centre of bright leaf tobacco and a major marketing and processing centre.

In 1874, he won a construction contract with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, using former contacts from his service in the Civil War. By 1892, when Nancy was thirteen years old, her father had re-established his wealth and built a sizeable home. Chiswell Langhorne later moved his family to an estate, known as &quot;Mirador&quot;, in Albemarle County, Virginia.

Nancy Langhorne had four sisters and three brothers who survived childhood. All of the sisters were known for their &quot;good looks&quot;. Nancy and her sister Irene both attended St. Catherine&#x27;s Episcopal School in Richmond, followed by a finishing school in New York City. There Nancy met her first husband, the socialite Robert Gould Shaw II, a first cousin of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who commanded the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first unit in the Union Army to be composed of African Americans. They married in New York City on 27 October 1897, when she was 18.

The marriage was unhappy. Shaw&#x27;s friends said Nancy became puritanical and rigid after marriage. Her friends said that Shaw was an abusive alcoholic. During their four-year marriage, they had one son, Robert Gould Shaw III (Bobbie). Nancy left Shaw numerous times during their marriage, the first during their honeymoon. In 1903, Nancy&#x27;s mother died; Nancy gained a divorce and moved back to &quot;Mirador&quot; to try to run her father&#x27;s household but was unsuccessful.

In 1904, Nancy took a tour of England, taking with her her son Bobbie, of whom she had gained custody. She fell in love with the country. Since she had been so happy there, her father suggested she move to England. Seeing that she was reluctant, Nancy&#x27;s father said it was also her mother&#x27;s wish, and he suggested she take her younger sister Phyllis with her. Nancy and Phyllis moved together to England in 1905. Their older sister Irene had married the artist Charles Dana Gibson and became a model for his Gibson Girls.

== England ==

Nancy Shaw was already known in English society as an interesting and witty American at a time when numerous wealthy young American women had married into the aristocracy. Her tendency to be saucy in conversation but religiously devout and almost prudish in behaviour confused many of the English men but pleased some of the older socialites. Nancy also began to show her skill at winning over critics. She was once asked by an English woman, &quot;Have you come to get our husbands?&quot; Her unexpected response, &quot;If you knew the trouble I had getting rid of mine...&quot;, charmed her listeners and displayed the wit for which she became known.
She married an Englishman, albeit one born in the United States, Waldorf Astor. When he was twelve, his father, William Waldorf Astor had moved the family to England and raised his children in the English aristocratic style. The couple were well matched, as both were American expatriates with similar temperaments. They were of the same age and even born on the same day, 19 May 1879. Astor shared some of Nancy&#x27;s moral attitudes and had a heart condition that may have contributed to his restraint. After the marriage, the Astors moved into Cliveden, a lavish estate in Buckinghamshire on the River Thames; it was a wedding gift from Astor&#x27;s father. Nancy Astor developed as a prominent hostess for the social elite.

The Astors also bought a substantial London house, No. 4 St. James&#x27;s Square, now the premises of the Naval &amp; Military Club. A blue plaque unveiled in 1987 commemorates Astor at St. James&#x27;s Square. Through her many social connections, Lady Astor became involved in a political circle called Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten. Considered liberal in their age, the group advocated unity and equality among English-speaking people and a continuance or expansion of the British Empire.

== Religious views ==
With Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten, Astor began her association with Philip Kerr. The friendship became important in her religious life; they met shortly after Kerr had suffered a spiritual crisis regarding his once devout Catholicism. They were attracted to Christian Science, to which they both eventually converted. After converting, she began to proselytise for that faith and played a role in Kerr&#x27;s conversion to it. She also tried to convert Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s daughters to Christian Science, which led to a rift between them.

Despite having Catholic friends including Belloc, Astor had religious views that included a strong vein of anti-Catholicism. Christopher Sykes argues that Kerr, an ex-Catholic, influenced this, but others argue that Astor&#x27;s Protestant Virginia origins are a sufficient explanation for her anti-Catholic views.

She attempted to discourage the hiring of Jews or Catholics to senior positions at &quot;The Observer&quot;, a newspaper owned by her husband. In 1927, she reportedly told James Louis Garvin that if he hired a Catholic, &quot;bishops would be there within a week.&quot;

== First campaign for Parliament ==

Several elements of Viscountess Astor&#x27;s life influenced her first campaign, but she became a candidate after her husband succeeded to the peerage and House of Lords in 1919. He had enjoyed a promising political career for several years before World War I in the House of Commons; after his father&#x27;s death, he succeeded to his father&#x27;s peerage as the 2nd Viscount Astor. He automatically became a member of the House of Lords and consequently had to forfeit his seat of Plymouth Sutton in the House of Commons. With this change, Lady Astor decided to contest the by-election for the vacant Parliamentary seat.

Astor had not been connected with the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the British Isles. However, she was met as she arrived at Paddington station on the day after her election by a crowd of suffragettes, including unnamed women who had been imprisoned and on hunger strike. One said, &quot;This is the beginning of our era. I am glad to have suffered for this.&quot;

Viscountess Astor was not the first woman elected to the Westminster Parliament. That was achieved by Constance Markievicz, who was the first woman MP elected to Westminster in 1918, but as she was an Irish Republican, she did not take her seat. As a result, Lady Astor is sometimes erroneously referred to as the first woman MP, or the first woman elected to the UK Parliament, rather than the first woman MP to take her seat in Parliament. Markievicz said Lady Astor was &quot;of the upper classes, out of touch&quot;. Countess Markievicz had been in Holloway prison for Sinn Féin activities during her election.

Astor was hampered in the popular campaign for her published and at times vocal teetotalism and her ignorance of current political issues. Astor appealed to voters on the basis of her earlier work with the Canadian soldiers, allies of the British, charitable work during the war, her financial resources for the campaign and her ability to improvise. Her audiences appreciated her wit and ability to turn the tables on hecklers. Once a man asked her what the Astors had done for him and she responded with, &quot;Why, Charlie, you know,&quot; and later had a picture taken with him. This informal style baffled yet amused the British public. She rallied the supporters of the current government, moderated her Prohibition views, and used women&#x27;s meetings to gain the support of female voters. A by-election was held on 28 November 1919, and she took up her seat in the House on 1 December as a Unionist (also known as &quot;Tory&quot;) Member of Parliament.

Astor was the first woman to be elected through what has been termed the &#x27;halo effect&#x27; of women taking over their husband&#x27;s parliamentary seat, a process which accounted for the election of ten women MPs (nearly a third of the women elected to parliament) between the two world wars.

== Early years in Parliament ==

Astor&#x27;s Parliamentary career was the most public phase of her life. She gained attention as a woman and as someone who did not follow the rules, often attributed to her American upbringing. On her first day in the House of Commons, she was called to order for chatting with a fellow House member, not realising that she was the person who was causing the commotion. She learned to dress more sedately and avoided the bars and smoking rooms frequented by the men.

Early in her first term, MP Horatio Bottomley wanted to dominate the &quot;soldier&#x27;s friend&quot; issue and, believing her to be an obstacle, sought to ruin her political career. He capitalised on her opposition to divorce reform and her efforts to maintain wartime alcohol restrictions. Bottomley portrayed her as a hypocrite, as she was divorced. He said that the reform bill that she opposed would allow women to have the same kind of divorce she had in America. Bottomley was later imprisoned for fraud, which Astor used to her advantage in other campaigns.

Astor made friends among women MPs, including members of the other parties. Margaret Wintringham was elected after Astor had been in office for two years. Astor befriended Ellen Wilkinson, a member of the Labour Party (and a former Communist). Astor later proposed creating a &quot;Women&#x27;s Party&quot;, but the female Labour MPs opposed that, as their party was then in office and had promised them positions. Over time, political differences separated the women MPs; by 1931 Astor became hostile to female Labour members such as Susan Lawrence.

Nancy Astor&#x27;s accomplishments in the House of Commons were relatively minor. Despite defending her seat in five consecutive elections throughout the 1920’s, She never held a position with much influence and or any post of ministerial rank although her time in Commons saw four Conservative Prime Ministers in office. The Duchess of Atholl (elected to Parliament in 1923, four years after Lady Astor) rose to higher levels in the Conservative Party before Astor. Astor felt if she had more position in the party, she would be less free to criticise her party&#x27;s government.

During this period, Nancy Astor continued to be active outside government by supporting the development and expansion of nursery schools for children&#x27;s education. She was introduced to the issue by socialist Margaret McMillan, who believed that her late sister helped guide her in life. Lady Astor was initially sceptical of that aspect, but the two women later became close. Astor used her wealth to aid their social efforts.

Although active in charitable efforts, Astor became noted for a streak of cruelty. On hearing of the death of a political enemy, she expressed her pleasure. When people complained, she did not apologise but said, &quot;I&#x27;m a Virginian; we shoot to kill.&quot; Angus McDonnell, a Virginia friend, angered her by marrying without consulting her on his choice. She later told him, regarding his maiden speech, that he &quot;really must do better than that.&quot; During the course of her adult life, Astor alienated many with her sharp words as well.
During the 1920s, Astor made several effective speeches in Parliament, and gained support for her Intoxicating Liquor (Sale to Persons under 18) Bill (nicknamed &quot;Lady Astor&#x27;s Bill&quot;), raising the legal age for consuming alcohol in a public house from 14 to 18. Her wealth and persona brought attention to women who were serving in government. She worked to recruit women into the civil service, the police force, education reform, and the House of Lords. She was well-liked in her constituency, as well as the United States during the 1920s, but her success is generally believed to have declined in the following decades.

In May 1922, Astor was guest of honour at a Pan-American conference held by the League of Women Voters in Baltimore, Maryland.

Astor became the first President of the newly-formed Electrical Association For Women in 1924.

She chaired the first ever International Conference of Women In Science, Industry and Commerce, a three-day event held London in July 1925, organised by Caroline Haslett for the Women&#x27;s Engineering Society in co-operation with other leading women&#x27;s groups. Astor hosted a large gathering at her home in St James&#x27;s to enable networking amongst the international delegates, and spoke strongly of her support of and the need for women to work in the fields of science, engineering and technology.

She was concerned about the treatment of juvenile victims of crime: &quot;The work of new MPs, such as Nancy Astor, led to a Departmental Committee on Sexual Offences Against Young People, which reported in 1925.&quot;

== 1930s ==
The 1930s were a decade of personal and professional difficulty for Lady Astor. In 1929, she won a narrow victory over the Labour candidate. In 1931, Bobby Shaw, her son from her first marriage, was arrested for homosexual offences. As her son had previously shown tendencies towards alcoholism and instability, Astor&#x27;s friend Philip Kerr, now the 11th Marquess of Lothian, suggested the arrest might act as a catalyst for him to change his behaviour, but he was incorrect.

Astor made a disastrous speech stating that alcohol use was the reason for England&#x27;s national cricket team being defeated by the Australian national cricket team. Both the English and Australian teams objected to that statement. Astor remained oblivious to her growing unpopularity almost to the end of her career.

Astor&#x27;s friendship with George Bernard Shaw helped her through some of her problems although his own nonconformity caused friction between them. They held opposing political views and had very different temperaments. However, his own tendency to make controversial statements or put her into awkward situations proved to be a drawback for her political career.

After Bobby Shaw was arrested, Gertrude Ely, a Pennsylvania Railroad heiress from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania offered to provide a guided tour to Moscow for Lady Astor and Bobby. Because of public comments by her and her son during this period, her political career suffered. Her son made many flattering statements about the Soviet Union, and Astor often disparaged it because she did not approve of Communism. In a meeting, she asked Joseph Stalin directly why he had slaughtered so many Russians, but many of her criticisms were translated as less challenging statements. Some of her conservative supporters feared she had &quot;gone soft&quot; on Communism; her question to Stalin may have been translated correctly only because he insisted of being told what she had said. The Conservatives felt that her son&#x27;s praise of the Soviet Union served as a coup for its propaganda and so they were unhappy with her tour.

== Antisemitism, anti-Catholicism, and anticommunism ==
Astor was reportedly a supporter of the Nazis as a solution to what she saw as the &quot;world problems&quot; of Jews and communists. In 1938, she met Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., who was a well-documented antisemite. She asked him not to take offence at her anti-Catholic views and wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m glad you are smart enough not to take my [views] personally&quot;. She highlighted the fact that she had a number of Catholic friends. Astor and Kennedy&#x27;s correspondence is reportedly filled with antisemitic language, and Edward J. Renehan Jr. wrote:

As fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and Astor looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these &quot;world problems&quot; (Nancy&#x27;s phrase). ... Kennedy replied that he expected the &quot;Jew media&quot; in the United States to become a problem, that &quot;Jewish pundits in New York and Los Angeles&quot; were already making noises contrived to &quot;set a match to the fuse of the world&quot;.

Astor commented to Kennedy that Hitler would have to do worse than &quot;give a rough time... to the killers of Christ&quot; for Britain and America to risk &quot;Armageddon to save them. The wheel of history swings round as the Lord would have it. Who are we to stand in the way of the future?&quot; Astor made various other documented anti-Semitic comments, such as her complaint that the &quot;Observer&quot; newspaper, which was owned at the time by her husband, was &quot;full of homosexuals and Jews&quot;, and her tense antisemitic exchange with MP Alan Graham in 1938, as described by Harold Nicolson:
David Feldman of the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism has also related that whilst attending a dinner at the Savoy Hotel in 1934, Astor asked the League of Nations&#x27; High Commissioner for Refugees whether he believed &quot;that there must be something in the Jews themselves that had brought them persecution throughout the ages&quot;. Dr Feldman acknowledged, however, that it was &quot;not an unusual view&quot; and explained it &quot;was a conventional idea in the UK at the time&quot;. Some years later, during a visit to New York in 1947, she apparently &quot;clashed&quot; with reporters, renouncing her antisemitism, telling one that she was &quot;not anti-Jewish but gangsterism isn&#x27;t going to solve the Palestine problem&quot;.

Astor was also deeply involved in the so-called Cliveden Set, a coterie of aristocrats that was described by one journalist as having subscribed to their own form of fascism. In that capacity, Astor was considered a &quot;legendary hostess&quot; for the group that in 1936 welcomed Hitler&#x27;s foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, who communicated to Hitler regarding the likelihood of an agreement between Germany and England and singled out the &quot;Astorgruppe&quot; as one of the circles &quot;that want a fresh understanding with Germany and who hold that it would not basically be impossible to achieve&quot;. The Sunday newspaper &quot;Reynolds News&quot;, also reported, &quot;Cliveden has been the centre of friendship with German influence&quot;. To that end, several of her friends and associates, especially the Marquess of Lothian, were involved in the policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany. Astor, however, was worried that the group might be viewed as a pro-German conspiracy, and her husband, William Waldorf Astor, wrote in a letter to the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;To link our weekends with any particular clique is as absurd as is the allegation that those of us who desire to establish better relations with Germany or Italy are pro-Nazis or pro-Fascists&quot;. The Cliveden Set was also depicted by war agitators as the prime movers for peace.

At the request of her friend Felix Frankfurter, a future US Supreme Court justice who was Jewish, Astor intervened with the Nazis in Vienna and secured the release of Frankfurter&#x27;s Jewish uncle, Solomon. Astor occasionally met with Nazi officials in keeping with Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s policies, and she was known to distrust and to dislike British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden. She is alleged to have told one Nazi official that she supported German rearmament because the country was &quot;surrounded by Catholics&quot;. She also told Ribbentrop, the German ambassador, who later became the foreign minister of Germany, that Hitler looked too much like Charlie Chaplin to be taken seriously. Those statements are the only documented incidents of her direct expressions to Nazis.

Astor became increasingly harsh in her anti-Catholic and anti-communist sentiments. After the passage of the Munich Agreement, she said that if the Czech refugees fleeing Nazi oppression were communists, they should seek asylum with the Soviets, instead of the British. While supporters of appeasement felt that to be out of line, the Marquess of Lothian encouraged her comments.

== World War II ==
When World War II began, Astor admitted that she had made mistakes, and voted against Chamberlain, but left-wing hostility to her politics remained. In a 1939 speech, the Labour MP Stafford Cripps called her &quot;The Member for Berlin&quot;.

Astor&#x27;s fear of Catholics increased and she made a speech saying that a Catholic conspiracy was subverting the Foreign Office. Based on her opposition to Communists, she insulted Stalin&#x27;s role (from 1941) as one of the Allied Powers during the war. Her speeches became rambling and incomprehensible; an opponent said that debating her had become &quot;like playing squash with a dish of scrambled eggs&quot;. On one occasion she accosted a young American soldier outside the Houses of Parliament. &quot;Would you like to go in?&quot; she asked. The GI replied: &quot;You are the sort of woman my mother told me to avoid&quot;.

The period from 1937 to the end of the war was personally difficult for Astor: in January of that year she lost her sister Phyllis, followed by her only surviving brother in 1938. In 1940, the Marquess of Lothian died. He had been her closest Christian Scientist friend even after her husband converted. George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s wife died three years later. During the war, Astor&#x27;s husband had a heart attack. After this, their marriage grew cold, likely due to her subsequent discomfort with his health problems. She ran a hospital for Canadian soldiers as she had during the First World War, but openly expressed a preference for the earlier soldiers.

It was generally believed that Lady Astor, during a World War II speech, referred to the men of the Eighth Army who were fighting in the Italian campaign as the &quot;D-Day Dodgers&quot;, suggesting they were avoiding the &quot;real war&quot; in France and the future invasion. The Allied soldiers in Italy were so incensed that Major Hamish Henderson of the 51st Highland Division composed a bitingly sarcastic song to the tune of the popular German song &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;, called &quot;The Ballad of the D-Day Dodgers&quot;. This song has also been attributed to Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn of the Tank Rescue Section, 19 Army Fire Brigade. However, there is no record that she actually said this, in or out of Parliament, and she denied ever saying it.

When told she was one of the people listed to be arrested, imprisoned and face possible execution in &quot;The Black Book&quot; under a German invasion of Britain, Lady Astor commented: &quot;It is the complete answer to the terrible lie that the so-called &#x27;Cliveden Set&#x27; was pro-Fascist.&quot;

== Final years ==

Lady Astor believed her party and her husband caused her retirement in 1945. As the Conservatives believed she had become a political liability in the final years of World War II, her husband said that if she stood for office again the family would not support her. She conceded but, according to contemporary reports, was both irritated and angry about her situation.

Lady Astor struggled in retirement, which put further strain on her marriage. In a speech commemorating her 25 years in parliament, she stated that her retirement was forced on her and that it should please the men of Britain. The couple began travelling separately and soon were living apart. Lord Astor also began moving towards left-wing politics in his last years, and that exacerbated their differences. However, the couple reconciled before his death on 30 September 1952.

Lady Astor&#x27;s public image suffered, as her ethnic and religious views were increasingly out of touch with cultural changes in Britain. She expressed a growing paranoia regarding ethnic minorities. In one instance, she stated that the President of the United States had become too dependent on New York City. To her this city represented &quot;Jewish and foreign&quot; influences that she feared. During a US tour, she told a group of African-American students that they should aspire to be like the black servants she remembered from her youth. On a later trip, she told African-American church members that they should be grateful for slavery because it had allowed them to be introduced to Christianity. In Rhodesia she proudly told the white minority government leaders that she was the daughter of a slave owner.

After 1956, Nancy Astor became increasingly isolated. In 1959, she was honoured by receiving the Freedom of City of Plymouth. By this time, she had lost all her sisters and brothers, her colleague &quot;Red Ellen&quot; Wilkinson died in 1947, George Bernard Shaw died in 1950, and she did not take well to widowhood. Her son Bobbie Shaw became increasingly combative and after her death he committed suicide. Her son, Jakie, married a prominent Catholic woman, which hurt his relationship with his mother. She and her other children became estranged. Gradually she began to accept Catholics as friends. However, she said that her final years were lonely.

Lady Astor died in 1964 at her daughter Nancy Astor&#x27;s home at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire. She was cremated and her ashes interred at the Octagon Temple at Cliveden.

== Alleged quotations ==
She was known for exchanges with Winston Churchill, though most of these are not well documented. Churchill told Lady Astor that having a woman in Parliament was like having one intrude on him in the bathroom, to which she retorted, &quot;You&#x27;re not handsome enough to have such fears.&quot;

Lady Astor is also said to have responded to a question from Churchill about what disguise he should wear to a masquerade ball by saying, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you come sober, Prime Minister?&quot;

Although variations on the following anecdote exist with different people, significantly predating Astor&#x27;s arrival in England, the story is being told of Winston Churchill&#x27;s encounter with Lady Astor who, after failing to shake him in an argument, broke off with the petulant remark, &quot;Oh, if you were my husband, I&#x27;d put poison in your tea.&quot; &quot;Madame,&quot; Winston responded, &quot;if I were your husband, I&#x27;d drink it with pleasure.&quot;
On another occasion, Lady Astor allegedly came upon Churchill, and he was highly intoxicated. She highly disapproved of alcohol, and she said to him &quot;Winston, you&#x27;re drunk!&quot; To which he replied &quot;And you are ugly. However, when I wake up tomorrow, I shall be sober, and you will still be ugly!&quot;

== Legacy ==
In 1982 the BBC broadcast a nine-part television drama serial about her life, &quot;Nancy Astor&quot;, which starred Lisa Harrow. A bronze statue of Lady Astor was installed in Plymouth, near her former family home, in 2019 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of her election to Parliament.

Astor&#x27;s antisemitism has been widely documented and has been criticised in recent years, particularly in light of former Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s 2019 unveiling of a statue in her honour with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in attendance, and more recently after Labour MP Rachel Reeves commemorated Astor in a series of tweets. The then-leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, while opposed to her anti-Semitism, recognised she was the first woman MP to take up her place in Parliament and so praised installation of the statue, commenting &quot;I&#x27;m really pleased the statue is going up&quot;.

During the George Floyd protests in 2020, the word &quot;Nazi&quot; was spray-painted on its base. The statue was on a list published on a website called &quot;Topple the Racists&quot;.

<text>Methionine (symbol Met or M) () is an essential amino acid in humans.

As the precursor of other non-essential amino acids such as cysteine and taurine, versatile compounds such as SAM-e, and the important antioxidant glutathione, methionine plays a critical role in the metabolism and health of many species, including humans. Methionine is also involved in angiogenesis and various processes related to DNA transcription, epigenetic expression, and gene regulation.

Methionine was first isolated in 1921 by John Howard Mueller. It is encoded by the codon AUG. It was named by Satoru Odake in 1925, as an abbreviation of its structural description 2-amino-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid.

==Biochemical details==
Methionine (abbreviated as Met or M; encoded by the codon AUG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological pH conditions), an amino group (which is in the protonated form under biological pH conditions) located in α-position with respect to the carboxyl group, and an &quot;S&quot;-methyl thioether side chain, classifying it as a nonpolar, aliphatic amino acid.

In nuclear genes of eukaryotes and in Archaea, methionine is coded for by the start codon, meaning it indicates the start of the coding region and is the first amino acid produced in a nascent polypeptide during mRNA translation.

==A proteinogenic amino acid==
Cysteine and methionine are the two sulfur-containing proteinogenic amino acids. Excluding the few exceptions where methionine may act as a redox sensor (e.g.,methionine sulfoxide), methionine residues do not have a catalytic role. This is in contrast to cysteine residues, where the thiol group has a catalytic role in many proteins. The thioether within methionine does however have a minor structural role due to the stability effect of S/π interactions between the side chain sulfur atom and aromatic amino acids in one-third of all known protein structures. This lack of a strong role is reflected in experiments where little effect is seen in proteins where methionine is replaced by norleucine, a straight hydrocarbon sidechain amino acid which lacks the thioether.
It has been conjectured that norleucine was present in early versions of the genetic code, but methionine intruded into the final version of the genetic code due to the fact it is used in the cofactor &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e). This situation is not unique and may have occurred with ornithine and arginine.

===Encoding===
Methionine is one of only two amino acids encoded by a single codon (AUG) in the standard genetic code (tryptophan, encoded by UGG, is the other). In reflection to the evolutionary origin of its codon, the other AUN codons encode isoleucine, which is also a hydrophobic amino acid. In the mitochondrial genome of several organisms, including metazoa and yeast, the codon AUA also encodes for methionine. In the standard genetic code AUA codes for isoleucine and the respective tRNA (&quot;ileX&quot; in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;) uses the unusual base lysidine (bacteria) or agmatidine (archaea) to discriminate against AUG.

The methionine codon AUG is also the most common start codon. A &quot;Start&quot; codon is message for a ribosome that signals the initiation of protein translation from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a Kozak consensus sequence. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the &quot;N&quot;-terminal position of proteins in eukaryotes and archaea during translation, although it can be removed by post-translational modification. In bacteria, the derivative &quot;N&quot;-formylmethionine is used as the initial amino acid.

==Derivatives==

===&quot;S&quot;-Adenosylmethionine===
The methionine-derivative &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a methyl donor. SAM-e is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5′ carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a sulfonium cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a soft Lewis acid (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the &quot;S&quot;-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as cobalamin (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM-e to initiate a radical reaction; these are called radical SAM-e enzymes.
As a result of the transfer of the methyl group, &quot;S&quot;-adenosylhomocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into autoinducer-2, which is excreted as a waste product or quorum signal.

== Biosynthesis ==

As an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins. In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the aspartate family, along with threonine and lysine (via diaminopimelate, but not via α-aminoadipate). The main backbone is derived from aspartic acid, while the sulfur may come from cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide.
* First, aspartic acid is converted via β-aspartyl semialdehyde into homoserine by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a γ-hydroxyl, hence the homo- series). The intermediate aspartate semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead condensed with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants).
* Homoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl.
** In plants and possibly in some bacteria, phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis.
** In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by &quot;metX&quot; or &quot;metA&quot; (not homologues).
** In enterobacteria and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single residue. The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (&quot;e.g.&quot; lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis).
* The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a γ-elimination followed by a variant of a Michael addition. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family, which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP (pyridoxal phosphate), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates.
** If it reacts with cysteine, it produces cystathionine, which is cleaved to yield homocysteine. The enzymes involved are cystathionine-γ-synthase (encoded by &quot;metB&quot; in bacteria) and cystathionine-β-lyase (&quot;metC&quot;). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing β or γ reactions to occur.
** If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by &quot;O&quot;-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase (formerly known as &quot;O&quot;-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either &quot;metY&quot; or &quot;metZ&quot; in bacteria.
** If it reacts with methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon.
* If homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two methionine synthases are known; one is cobalamin (vitamin B12) dependent and one is independent.

The pathway using cysteine is called the &quot;transsulfuration pathway&quot;, while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called &quot;direct-sulfurylation pathway&quot;.

Cysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (&quot;reverse transsulfurylation route&quot;) or from hydrogen sulfide (&quot;direct sulfurylation route&quot;); the activated serine is generally &quot;O&quot;-acetylserine (via CysK or CysM in &quot;E. coli&quot;), but in &quot;Aeropyrum pernix&quot; and some other archaea &quot;O&quot;-phosphoserine is used. CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade.

===Transsulfurylation pathway===

Enzymes involved in the &quot;E. coli&quot; transsulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis:
# Aspartokinase
# Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase
# Homoserine dehydrogenase
# Homoserine &quot;O&quot;-transsuccinylase
# Cystathionine-γ-synthase
# Cystathionine-β-lyase
# Methionine synthase (in mammals, this step is performed by homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine—homocysteine &quot;S&quot;-methyltransferase.)

== Other biochemical pathways ==

Although mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways:

===Catabolism===
Methionine is converted to &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) by (1) methionine adenosyltransferase.

SAM-e serves as a methyl donor in many (2) methyltransferase reactions, and is converted to &quot;S&quot;-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).

(3) Adenosylhomocysteinase
cysteine.

===Regeneration===
Methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) methionine synthase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor.

Homocysteine can also be remethylated using glycine betaine (&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-trimethylglycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT). BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase.

===Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine===
Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine.
* (5) Cystathionine-β-synthase (an enzyme which requires pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6) combines homocysteine and serine to produce cystathionine. Instead of degrading cystathionine via cystathionine-β-lyase, as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to cysteine and α-ketobutyrate via (6) cystathionine-γ-lyase.
* (7) The enzyme α-ketoacid dehydrogenase converts α-ketobutyrate to propionyl-CoA, which is metabolized to succinyl-CoA in a three-step process (see propionyl-CoA for pathway).

===Ethylene synthesis===
This amino acid is also used by plants for synthesis of ethylene. The process is known as the Yang cycle or the methionine cycle.
== Metabolic diseases ==
The degradation of methionine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases:
* Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA)
* Homocystinuria
* Methylmalonic acidemia
* Propionic acidemia

==Chemical synthesis==
The industrial synthesis combines acrolein, methanethiol, and cyanide, which affords the hydantoin. Racemic methionine can also be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate by alkylation with chloroethylmethylsulfide (ClCH2CH2SCH3) followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation. Also see Methanol. 

==Human nutrition==

There is inconclusive clinical evidence on methionine supplementation. Dietary restriction of methionine can lead to bone-related disorders.

Methionine supplementation may benefit those suffering from copper poisoning.

Overconsumption of methionine, the methyl group donor in DNA methylation, is related to cancer growth in a number of studies.

===Requirements===
The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For methionine combined with cysteine, for adults 19 years and older, 19 mg/kg body weight/day.

This translates to about 1.33 grams per day for a 70 kilogram individual.

===Dietary sources===
High levels of methionine can be found in eggs, meat, and fish; sesame seeds, Brazil nuts, and some other plant seeds; and cereal grains. Most fruits and vegetables contain very little. Most legumes, though protein dense, are low in methionine. Proteins without adequate methionine are not considered to be complete proteins. For that reason, racemic methionine is sometimes added as an ingredient to pet foods.

==Health==
Loss of methionine has been linked to senile greying of hair. Its lack leads to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in hair follicles, a reduction in tyrosinase effectiveness, and a gradual loss of hair color. Methionine raises the intracellular concentration of glutathione, thereby promoting antioxidant-mediated cell defense and redox regulation. It also protects cells against dopamine induced nigral cell loss by binding oxidative metabolites.

Methionine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cysteine, carnitine, taurine, lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, and other phospholipids. Improper conversion of methionine can lead to atherosclerosis due to accumulation of homocysteine.

==Other uses==
-Methionine is sometimes given as a supplement to dogs; It helps reduce the chances of kidney stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used.

Methionine is allowed as a supplement to organic poultry feed under the US certified organic program.

Methionine can be used as a nontoxic pesticide option against giant swallowtail caterpillars, which are a serious pest to orange crops.

<text>The large intestine, also known as the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in tetrapods. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored in the rectum as feces before being removed by defecation. The colon (progressing from the ascending colon to the transverse, the descending and finally the sigmoid colon) is the longest portion of the large intestine, and the terms &quot;large intestine&quot; and &quot;colon&quot; are often used interchangeably, but most sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. Some other sources exclude the anal canal.

In humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. It then continues as the colon ascending the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon, and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. Overall, in humans, the large intestine is about long, which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the human gastrointestinal tract.

==Structure==

The colon of the large intestine is the last part of the digestive system. It has a segmented appearance due to a series of saccules called haustra. It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which the fermentation of unabsorbed material by the gut microbiota occurs. Unlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients. About 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water arrives in the colon each day.

The colon is the longest part of the large intestine and its average length in the adult human is 65 inches or 166 cm (range of 80 to 313 cm) for males, and 61 inches or 155 cm (range of 80 to 214 cm) for females.

===Sections===

In mammals, the large intestine consists of the cecum (including the appendix), colon (the longest part), rectum, and anal canal.

The four sections of the colon are: the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. These sections turn at the colic flexures.

The parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs, in general, do not have a complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. Of the colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.

In terms of diameter, the cecum is the widest, averaging slightly less than 9 cm in healthy individuals, and the transverse colon averages less than 6 cm in diameter. The descending and sigmoid colon are slightly smaller, with the sigmoid colon averaging in diameter. Diameters larger than certain thresholds for each colonic section can be diagnostic for megacolon.
====Cecum and appendix====

The cecum is the first section of the large intestine and is involved in digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it, is not involved in digestion and is considered to be part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The function of the appendix is uncertain, but some sources believe that it has a role in housing a sample of the gut microbiota, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with microbiota if depleted during the course of an immune reaction. The appendix has also been shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells.

====Ascending colon====

The ascending colon is the first of four main sections of the large intestine. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum. The ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).

One of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it. As the waste material exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to the ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. The waste material is pumped upwards toward the transverse colon by peristalsis. The ascending colon is sometimes attached to the appendix via Gerlach&#x27;s valve. In ruminants, the ascending colon is known as the spiral colon.
Taking into account all ages and sexes, colon cancer occurs here most often (41%).

====Transverse colon====

The transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure, also known as the right colic, (the turn of the colon by the liver) to the splenic flexure also known as the left colic, (the turn of the colon by the spleen). The transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold of peritoneum called the greater omentum. On the posterior side, the transverse colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the transverse mesocolon.

The transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is therefore mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after it).

The proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle colic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter third is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The &quot;watershed&quot; area between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic division between the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia.

====Descending colon====

The descending colon is the part of the colon from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. One function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied into the rectum. It is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. In the other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery. The arterial supply comes via the left colic artery. The descending colon is also called the &quot;distal gut&quot;, as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut. Gut flora are very dense in this region.

====Sigmoid colon====

The sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the rectum. The name &quot;sigmoid&quot; means S-shaped (see ; cf. sigmoid sinus). The walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular and contract to increase the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.

The sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2 and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. The IMA terminates as the superior rectal artery.

Sigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique used to examine the sigmoid colon.

====Rectum====

The rectum is the last section of the large intestine. It holds the formed feces awaiting elimination via defecation.
It is about 12 cm long.

===Appearance===
The cecum – the first part of the large intestine
* Taeniae coli – three bands of smooth muscle
* Haustra – bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli
* Epiploic appendages – small fat accumulations on the viscera

The taenia coli run the length of the large intestine. Because the taenia coli are shorter than the large bowel itself, the colon becomes &quot;sacculated&quot;, forming the haustra of the colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.

===Blood supply===
Arterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Flow between these two systems communicates via the marginal artery of the colon that runs parallel to the colon for its entire length. Historically, a structure variously identified as the arc of Riolan or meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz) was thought to connect the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA. This variably present structure would be important if either vessel were occluded. However, at least one review of the literature questions the existence of this vessel, with some experts calling for the abolition of these terms from future medical literature.

Venous drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver. Middle rectal veins are an exception, delivering blood to inferior vena cava and bypassing the liver.

===Lymphatic drainage===
Lymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the ileocolic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal ileocolic nodes. The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition.

===Nerve supply===
Sympathetic supply: superior &amp; inferior mesenteric ganglia;
parasympathetic supply: vagus &amp; sacral plexus (S2-S4)

===Development===

The endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm are germ layers that develop in a process called gastrulation. Gastrulation occurs early in human development. The gastrointestinal tract is derived from these layers.

===Variation===
One variation on the normal anatomy of the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to five metres longer than normal. This condition, referred to as redundant colon, typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus occurs, resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. A significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope is difficult and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present, though specialized variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant) are useful in overcoming this problem.

==Microanatomy==
===Colonic crypts===

The wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelium with invaginations. The invaginations are called the intestinal glands or colonic crypts.

The colon crypts are shaped like microscopic thick walled test tubes with a central hole down the length of the tube (the crypt lumen). Four tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long axes of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. In these images the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CCOI). The nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. As seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. Baker et al. found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. Thus, by the images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2,530 cells per colonic crypt. Nooteboom et al. measuring the number of cells in a small number of crypts reported a range of 1,500 to 4,900 cells per colonic crypt. Cells are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before being shed into the colonic lumen days later. There are 5 to 6 stem cells at the bases of the crypts.

As estimated from the image in panel A, there are about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic epithelium. Since the average length of the human colon is 160.5 cm and the average inner circumference of the colon is 6.2 cm, the inner surface epithelial area of the human colon has an average area of about 995 cm2, which includes 9,950,000 (close to 10 million) crypts.

In the four tissue sections shown here, many of the intestinal glands have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the &quot;CCOI&quot; gene and appear mostly white, with their main color being the blue-gray staining of the nuclei. As seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of three crypts appear to have a mutation in &quot;CCOI&quot;, so that 40% to 50% of the cells arising from those stem cells form a white segment in the cross cut area.

Overall, the percent of crypts deficient for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then increases linearly with age. Colonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches, on average, 18% in women and 23% in men by 80–84 years of age.

Crypts of the colon can reproduce by fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning to form two crypts, and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning. Most crypts deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts) with two or more CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D).

====Mucosa====
About 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed in the large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different regions and include CEACAM7.

==Function==

The large intestine absorbs water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the indigestible matter to the rectum. The colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the colonic bacteria, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin K (especially important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate blood coagulation). It also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.

The large intestine also secretes K+ and Cl-. Chloride secretion increases in cystic fibrosis.
Recycling of various nutrients takes place in the colon. Examples include fermentation of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling.

The appendix contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. However, the appendix is known to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and development.

By the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and 90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. Indeed, as demonstrated by the commonality of ileostomy procedures, it is possible for many people to live without large portions of their large intestine, or even without it completely. At this point only some electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). As the chyme moves through the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. The ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. The muscles of the colon then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending colon.

The bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment and create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. No protein is made available. In humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available, thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. The large intestine produces no digestive enzymes — chemical digestion is completed in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. The pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).

===Standing gradient osmosis===
Water absorption at the colon typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.

===Gut flora===
The large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. Species diversity varies by geography and diet. The microbes in a human distal gut often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams (0.44 pounds). This mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called the latest human organ to be &quot;discovered&quot; or in other words, the &quot;forgotten organ&quot;.

The large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria inhabiting this region. Undigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by passive diffusion. The bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty acids.

These bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. Although this source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement, it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. An individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing bacteria.

Other bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. Bacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides produces these. Some of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from the amino acid tryptophan. The normal flora is also essential in the development of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.

They are also involved in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. These are antibodies produced by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion.

The two most prevalent phyla of the colon are Bacillota and Bacteroidota. The ratio between the two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project. Bacteroides are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer. Bifidobacteria are also abundant, and are often described as &#x27;friendly bacteria&#x27;.

A mucus layer protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal bacteria.

==Clinical significance==

===Disease===

Following are the most common diseases or disorders of the colon:
===Colonoscopy===
Colonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and the distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus. It can provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions. Colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less. Once polyps are removed, they can be studied with the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. It takes 15 years or fewer for a polyp to turn cancerous.

Colonoscopy is similar to sigmoidoscopy—the difference being related to which parts of the colon each can examine. A colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon (1200–1500 mm in length). A sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600 mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion of the colon.

A sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening procedure for a full colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with a stool-based test such as a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), or multi-target stool DNA test (Cologuard) or blood-based test, SEPT9 DNA methylation test (Epi proColon). About 5% of these screened patients are referred to colonoscopy.

Virtual colonoscopy, which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans, is also possible, as a totally non-invasive medical test, although it is not standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities. Furthermore, virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. If a growth or polyp is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would still need to be performed. Additionally, surgeons have lately been using the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.

==Other animals==
The large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods, in which it is almost always separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal valve. In most vertebrates, however, it is a relatively short structure running directly to the anus, although noticeably wider than the small intestine. Although the caecum is present in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of the large intestine develop into a true colon.

In some small mammals, the colon is straight, as it is in other tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian species, it is divided into ascending and descending portions; a distinct transverse colon is typically present only in primates. However, the taeniae coli and accompanying haustra are not found in either carnivorans or ruminants. The rectum of mammals (other than monotremes) is derived from the cloaca of other vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly homologous with the &quot;rectum&quot; found in these species.

In some fish, there is no true large intestine, but simply a short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca. In sharks, this includes a &quot;rectal gland&quot; that secretes salt to help the animal maintain osmotic balance with the seawater. The gland somewhat resembles a caecum in structure but is not a homologous structure.

<text>John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore (1730 – 25 February 1809) was a British colonial administrator who served as the governor of Virginia from 1771 to 1775. Dunmore was named governor of New York in 1770. He succeeded to the same position in the colony of Virginia the following year after the death of Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt. As Virginia&#x27;s governor, Dunmore directed a series of campaigns against the trans-Appalachian Indians, known as Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War. He is noted for issuing a 1775 document, Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation, offering freedom to slaves who fought for the British Crown against Patriot rebels in Virginia. Dunmore fled to New York after the burning of Norfolk in 1776 and later returned to Britain. He was Governor of the Bahamas from 1787 to 1796.

==Early life==

Murray was born in Taymouth, Scotland, the eldest son of William Murray, 3rd Earl of Dunmore, by his marriage to Catherine Nairne; he was a nephew of John Murray, 2nd Earl of Dunmore. In 1745, both Murray, then only 15, and his father joined the ill-fated Rising of &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; (Charles Edward Stuart). The young Murray was appointed as a page to Prince Charles. The second Earl, his uncle, remained loyal to the Hanoverians.

After the Jacobite Army was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, William Murray was imprisoned in the Tower of London, and his family was put under house arrest. By 1750, William Murray had received a conditional pardon. John Murray was now aged twenty and joined the British Army. In 1756, after the deaths of his uncle and father, he became the fourth Earl of Dunmore. In 1759, Dunmore married Lady Charlotte Stewart (1740 – 11 November 1818), a daughter of Alexander Stewart, 6th Earl of Galloway. They had five sons and three daughters:
* Lady Catherine Murray (23 January 1760 – 7 July 1783) married the Hon. Edward Bouverie, son of William de Bouverie, 1st Earl of Radnor. They had no issue.
* Lady Augusta Murray (27 January 1761 – 5 March 1830) in 1793 secretly married Prince Augustus Frederick, son of King George III. Under the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the marriage was void, and the children were illegitimate – Sir Augustus d&#x27;Este and Augusta d&#x27;Este (later Baroness Truro).
* George Murray, 5th Earl of Dunmore (30 April 1762 – 11 November 1836)
* Hon. William Murray (22 August 1763 – 27 May 1773)
* Lt.-Col. Hon. Alexander Murray (12 October 1764 – July 1842). He married Deborah Hunt, daughter of Robert Hunt, Governor of the Bahamas. They had three sons and two daughters.
* Hon. John Murray (25 February 1766 – 14 December 1824). Unmarried.
* Lady Susan Murray (17 June 1767 – April 1826). She married, firstly, John Tharp, heir to a Jamaica sugar fortune. Secondly, she married John Drew, son of the Chichester banker John Drew; and lastly, a clergyman in Ireland, the Reverend Archibald Edward Douglas. She had children by each, including John Tharp, who married Lady Hannah Charlotte Hay, daughter of George Hay, 7th Marquess of Tweeddale.
* Hon. Leveson Granville Keith Murray (16 December 1770 – 4 January 1835). He married three times, the first of which was Wemyss Dalrymple, daughter of Sir William Dalrymple of Cousland, 3rd Baronet, and together they had a daughter, Jane. Secondly, Anne, by whom he had two sons and a daughter. His last wife was Louisa Mitty Abraham.

==Colonial governor of New York==
Dunmore was named the British governor of the Province of New York from 1770 to 1771. Soon after his appointment, in 1770, Virginia&#x27;s governor, Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt (Lord Botetourt), died, and Dunmore was eventually named to replace him. William Nelson was named as interim Governor.

==Colonial governor of Virginia==

===Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War===

Dunmore became royal governor of the Colony of Virginia on 25 September 1771. Despite growing issues with Great Britain, his predecessor, Lord Botetourt, was a popular governor in Virginia, even though he served only two years before his death. Like many in the ruling class of Virginia, Dunmore acquired ownership over several slaves. As Virginia&#x27;s colonial governor, Dunmore directed a series of campaigns against the Indians known as Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War. The Shawnee were the main target of these attacks. He aimed to strengthen Virginia&#x27;s claims in the west, particularly in the Ohio Country. However, as a byproduct, it was known he would increase his power base. Some even accused Dunmore of colluding with the Shawnees and arranging the war to deplete the Virginia militia and help safeguard the Loyalist cause, should there be a colonial rebellion. Dunmore, in his history of the Indian Wars, denied these accusations.

===Battle for control===
Lacking diplomatic skills, Dunmore tried to govern without consulting the House of Burgesses of the Colonial Assembly for more than a year, which exacerbated an already tense situation.

When Dunmore finally convened the Colonial Assembly in March 1773, which was the only way he could deal with fiscal issues to finance his war through additional taxation, the burgesses instead first resolved to form a committee of correspondence to communicate their continued concerns about the Townshend Acts and Gaspee Affair to Great Britain. Dunmore immediately postponed the Assembly. Many burgesses gathered a short distance away at the Raleigh Tavern and continued discussing their problems with the new taxes, perceived corruption, and lack of representation in England. When Dunmore reconvened the Assembly in 1774, the burgesses passed a resolution declaring 1 June 1774 a day of fasting and prayer in Virginia. In response, Dunmore dissolved the House.

The burgesses again reconvened as the Second Virginia Convention and elected delegates to the Continental Congress. Dunmore issued a proclamation against electing delegates to the Congress but failed to take serious action. In March 1775, Patrick Henry&#x27;s &quot;Give me Liberty or give me Death!&quot; speech delivered at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Richmond helped convince delegates to approve a resolution calling for armed resistance.

In the face of rising unrest in the colony, Dunmore sought to deprive Virginia&#x27;s militia of military supplies. Dunmore gave the key to the Williamsburg magazine to Lieutenant Henry Colins, commander of HMS &quot;Magdalen&quot;, and ordered him to remove the powder, provoking what became known as the Gunpowder Incident. On the night of 20 April 1775, royal marines loaded fifteen half-barrels of powder into the governor&#x27;s wagon, intent on transporting it down the Quarterpath Road to the James River and the British warship. Local militia rallied, and word of the incident spread across the colony.

===Confrontation with the Hanover militia===
The Hanover militia, led by Patrick Henry, arrived outside Williamsburg on 3 May. That same day, Dunmore evacuated his family from the Governor&#x27;s Palace to his hunting lodge, Porto Bello in nearby York County. On 6 May, Dunmore issued a proclamation against &quot;a &quot;certain&quot; Patrick Henry... and a Number of deluded Followers&quot; who had organised &quot;an Independent Company... and put themselves in a Posture of War.&quot;

Dunmore threatened to impose martial law and eventually retreated to Porto Bello to join his family. Dislodged by the Virginia rebels and wounded in the leg, on 8 June, Dunmore took refuge on the British warship in the York River. Over the following months, Dunmore sent many raiding parties to plunder plantations along the James, York, and Potomac rivers, particularly those owned by rebels. The British raiding parties exacerbated tensions by plundering Patriot supplies and encouraging their slaves to rebel. In December, George Washington, who had been installed only months before as commander in chief of the Continental Army, commented, &quot;I do not think that forcing his lordship on shipboard is sufficient. Nothing less than depriving him of life or liberty will secure peace to Virginia, as motives of resentment actuate his conduct to a degree equal to the total destruction of that colony.&quot;

===Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation===
Dunmore is noted for Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation, also known as Lord Dunmore&#x27;s Offer of Emancipation. Dated 7 November 1775 but proclaimed a week later, Dunmore thereby formally offered freedom to slaves who abandoned their Patriot masters to join the British. The proclamation appeared to respond to the legislature&#x27;s proclamation that Dunmore had resigned his position by boarding a Royal Navy warship off Yorktown nearly six months earlier. However, by the end of the war, an estimated 800 to 2000 formerly enslaved people sought refuge with the British; some served in a military role, though the majority served in noncombatant roles.

Dunmore organized these Black Loyalists into the Ethiopian Regiment. However, despite winning the Battle of Kemp&#x27;s Landing on 17 November 1775, Dunmore lost decisively at the Battle of Great Bridge on 9 December 1775. Following that defeat, Dunmore loaded his troops and many Virginia Loyalists onto Royal Navy ships waiting offshore. Smallpox spread in the confined quarters, and some 500 of the 800 members of the Ethiopian Regiment died.

===Final skirmishes and return to Britain===
On New Year&#x27;s Day in 1776, Dunmore gave orders to burn waterfront buildings in Norfolk from which patriot troops were firing on his ships. However, the fire spread. The city burned, and with it, any hope that Dunmore&#x27;s loyalists could return to Virginia. Dunmore retreated to New York. Some ships of his refugee fleet were sent south, mainly to Florida. Esek Hopkins, the new commander of the American navy, was given orders in early January 1776 to pursue Dunmore, who the Virginians viewed as a pirate, but Hopkins selected the Bahamas as a better target. When Dunmore realized he could not regain control in Virginia, he returned to Britain in July 1776. Dunmore continued to draw his pay as the colony&#x27;s governor until 1783, when Britain recognized American independence.

==Colonial governor of the Bahamas==
From 1787 to 1796, Dunmore served as governor of the Bahamas. During his tenure as governor, the British issued land grants to American Loyalists who went into exile. The sparse population of the Bahamas tripled within a few years. The Loyalists developed cotton as a commodity crop, but it dwindled from insect damage and soil exhaustion. In addition to the slaves they brought with them, the Loyalist planters&#x27; descendants imported more enslaved people from Africa for labour.

==Peerage==
Dunmore sat as a Scottish representative peer in the House of Lords from 1761 to 1774 and from 1776 to 1790.

==Death==
Dunmore died on 25 February 1809 in Ramsgate in Kent. He was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, George. The Countess of Dunmore died in 1819.

==Legacy==
* Dunmore County, Virginia, formed in 1772, was named in his honour. However, during the American Revolutionary War, the citizens changed its name to Shenandoah County in 1778.
* Lake Dunmore in Salisbury, Vermont, was named after him in 1773 since he had claimed ownership of the area while he was Governor of New York.
* Porto Bello, the hunting lodge of Lord Dunmore, still stands on the grounds of Camp Peary in York County, Virginia. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Access to the base is highly restricted, so the structure is not available for public viewing.
* The Dunmore Pineapple was built in 1761 before he left Scotland. The building is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland and is leased to the Landmark Trust who use it to provide holiday accommodation. The gardens are open to the public year-round.
* Dunmore Street in Norfolk, Virginia, was named for him. It is said that the naming of Dunmore Street was not to honour the ex-governor but to celebrate the place in Norfolk where he had last set foot.
* The borough of Dunmore in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, is named after Dunmore Park in Scotland, the location of the Dunmore Pineapple.
* Lord Dunmore Drive in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
* Dunmore Town, Harbour Island, North Eleuthera, Bahamas.

<text>Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere (18 August 127514 April 1322) was an English soldier, diplomat, member of parliament, landowner and nobleman. He was the son and heir of Sir Gunselm de Badlesmere (died ca. 1301) and Joan FitzBernard. He fought in the English army both in France and Scotland during the later years of the reign of Edward I of England and the earlier part of the reign of Edward II of England. He was executed after participating in an unsuccessful rebellion led by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster.

==Career==
The earliest records of Bartholomew&#x27;s life relate to his service in royal armies, which included campaigns in Gascony (1294), Flanders (about 1297) and Scotland (1298, 1300, 1301–04, 1306–08, 1310–11, 1314–19). However, even at a relatively young age his activities were not limited to soldiering. 

In October 1300, he was one of the household of Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln who were permitted by the King to accompany the Earl when he set out for Rome during the following month in order to complain to Pope Boniface VIII of injury done by the Scots.

A writ issued on 13 April 1301, presumably soon after the death of Jocelin, Sir Gunselm de Badlesmere, initiated inquests into the identity of the next heir of lands that he held direct from the King. This led to a hearing on 30 April of that year in relation to property in Kent at Badlesmere and Donewelleshethe, where it was confirmed that the heir was his son Bartholomew, then aged 26.

Bartholomew de Badlesmere and Fulk Payfrer were the knights who represented the county of Kent at the Parliament that sat at Carlisle from January 1306/7 until 27 March 1307. Also in 1307 Bartholomew was appointed governor of Bristol Castle. In that role he took charge of the subjugation of the city when it defied royal authority in 1316.

In 1310, Bartholomew acted as deputy Constable of England on behalf of the Earl of Hereford. Bartholomew served as his lieutenant when Hereford refused to perform his duties in the Scottish campaign of 1310–11. He was one of the retinue of the Earl of Gloucester at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June 1314, Bartholomew&#x27;s own sub-retinue consisting of at least 50 men. He was criticised for not coming to his aid when Gloucester lost his life in an impetuous attack on the Scottish schiltron on that occasion.

In the following January, Bartholomew was one of the many notables who attended the funeral of Piers Gaveston.

On 28 April 1316, Bartholomew was one of four men who were authorised to grant safe conducts in the King&#x27;s name to Robert Bruce and other Scots so that they could come to England to negotiate a truce. In December of that year, he was commissioned, along with the Bishop of Ely and the Bishop of Norwich to go on an embassy to Pope John XXII at Avignon to seek his help against the Scots and request a Bull to release the King from his oath to the Ordinances. In June of the same year, Bartholomew&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth married Edward, the son and heir of Roger Mortimer. Bartholomew was sufficiently wealthy to pay £2,000 for the marriage, in exchange for which extensive property was settled on the bride.

On 1 November 1317, the King appointed Bartholomew as custodian of Leeds Castle in Kent This was followed by a transaction on 20 March 1318 by which the King granted the castle and manor of Leeds along with the advowson of the priory of Leeds to Bartholomew and his heirs in exchange for the manor and advowson of Adderley, Shropshire, which Bartholomew surrendered to the King 

By late November 1317, Bartholomew made a compact with a number of noblemen and prelates, including Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and the Archbishop of Canterbury with the aim of reducing the influence on the King of advisors of whom they disapproved. Bartholomew and his associates formed a loose grouping which has been referred to by modern historians as the &quot;Middle Party&quot;, who detested alike Edward&#x27;s minions, such as the Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, and his violent enemies such as Lancaster. Although he was hostile to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, Bartholomew helped to make peace between the king and Lancaster in 1318.

On 1 October 1318, Bartholomew was with the King at York, setting out to repel an invasion by the Scots. Nineteen days later, he was appointed as the King&#x27;s household steward in place of William Montagu. This position was of major importance, as it provided continual access to the King&#x27;s presence and considerable influence over who could obtain access to the king. Bartholomew was still holding this appointment in June 1321. Financial grants that he received during this period included £500 on appointment as steward and over £1,300 in October 1319.

In 1319, Bartholomew obtained the king&#x27;s licence to found a priory on his manor of Badlesmere, but the proposed priory was never established. In June of the following year, he hosted a splendid reception at Chilham Castle for Edward II and his entourage when they were travelling to Dover en route for France. Also in 1320, he was granted control of Dover Castle and Wardenship of the Cinque Ports and in 1321 was appointed governor of Tunbridge Castle.

During the earlier part of 1321, Bartholomew, along with the Bishop of Worcester and the Bishop of Carlisle and others represented the King in unsuccessful negotiations with the Scots for either a permanent peace or an extended truce.

==Rebellion==
By the summer of 1321, Bartholomew defied the King by associating with their mutual enemy the Earl of Lancaster and his allies in their active opposition to Edward&#x27;s &quot;evil councillors&quot; such as the Despensers. The Lancastrian forces moved from the North to London, reaching the capital by the end of July.

In the autumn, the King started to apply pressure targeted on Bartholomew, probably partly because many of his manors were closer to London than those of magnates such as Lancaster and partly because of anger at the disloyalty of his own household steward. Edward took control of Dover Castle and forbade Bartholomew entrance to the county of Kent, an injunction that he promptly breached. Bartholomew then returned to Witney, Oxfordshire, where a tournament attended by many of his new allies was being held. When returning to London from a pilgrimage to Canterbury, the Queen did not take the most direct route but detoured to Leeds Castle, where she and her armed retinue demanded access, precipitating the siege and its aftermath that is described in detail in the article about Bartholomew&#x27;s wife.

Although Bartholomew assembled an armed force and marched from Witney towards Kent, by the time he reached Kingston upon Thames it was clear that he would not receive help from Lancaster and his followers and so he was not able to take effective action to relieve the siege. During the following months, civil war broke out.

On 26 December 1321, the King ordered the Sheriff of Gloucester to arrest Bartholomew. Shortly afterwards, the King offered safe conducts to the rebels who would come over to him, with the specific exception of Bartholomew de Badlesmere.

Details contained in arrest warrants signpost the progress of Bartholomew and his companions across England. By 15 January 1321/2, they had occupied and burned the town of Bridgnorth and sacked the castles at Elmley and Hanley. By 23 February, the rebels had been sighted in Northamptonshire. On 1 March, Bartholomew was reported as one of a number of prominent rebels who had reached Pontefract.

On 11 March the sheriff of Nottingham and Derby was ordered to arrest the same group, who had taken Burton upon Trent but they departed from that town when the royal army approached. On 16 March 1321/22, the Earl of Lancaster and his allies were defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge.

==Death==
Bartholomew fled south from Boroughbridge and, according to the &quot;Livere de Reis&quot;, was captured in a small wood near Brickden and taken by the Earl of Mar to Canterbury. Alternative details appear in John Leland&#x27;s &quot;Collectanea&quot;, which states that &quot;Syr Barptolemew Badelesmere was taken at Stow Parke yn the Manoyr of the Bishop of Lincoln that was his nephew.&quot; Stow Park is about 10 miles north-west of the centre of Lincoln, where the bishop was Henry Burghersh. Stow Park was one of the principal residences of the Bishop in that era but none of the medieval buildings still survive above ground. The identity of &quot;Brickden&quot; is uncertain but may well refer to Buckden, Huntingdonshire, another place where the Bishop of Lincoln had a manor house (Buckden Towers). If so, that may be the reason for the differing accounts of the place that Bartholomew had reached when he was arrested, as they both featured residences of his nephew.

Bartholomew was tried at Canterbury on 14 April 1322 and sentenced to death. On the same day he was drawn for three miles behind a horse to Blean, where he held property. There he was hanged and beheaded. His head was displayed on the Burgh Gate at Canterbury and the rest of his body left hanging at Blean. There it probably remained for quite some time, as it was not until the Lent Parliament of 1324 that the prelates successfully petitioned for the bodies of the nobles still hanging on the gallows to be given ecclesiastical burial. In a book that was first published in 1631, the antiquary John Weever stated that Bartholomew was buried at White Friars, Canterbury; this was a community of the Order of St Augustine.

==Property==
By the latter part of his life, Bartholomew possessed a vast portfolio of properties, either in his own right or jointly with his wife Margaret. These assets were forfeited because of Bartholomew&#x27;s rebellion. During the first four years of reign of Edward III, a series of inquisitions post mortem established the properties to which Margaret was entitled and also those of which her son Giles would be the right heir. Much of the property was restored to Bartholomew&#x27;s widow or assigned to Giles, who at that juncture was still a minor in the King&#x27;s wardship.

Some of the properties that Bartholomew held are listed below; the list is not exhaustive and he did not necessarily hold all of them at the same time.
* Bedfordshire: The manor of Sondyington (i.e. Sundon).
* Buckinghamshire: The manor of Hambleden. Also the manors of Cowley and Preston, both of which were in the parish of Preston Bissett.
* Essex: The manors of Chingford, Latchley (i.e. Dagworth Manor at Pebmarsh), Little Stambridge and Thaxted.
* Gloucestershire: The manor of Oxenton.
* Herefordshire: The manor of Lenhales and Lenhales Castle at Lyonshall.
* Hertfordshire: The manors of Buckland, Mardleybury (at Welwyn) and Plashes (at Standon).
* Kent: The manors of Badlesmere, Bockingfold (north of Goudhurst), Chilham, Hothfield, Kingsdown, Lesnes, Rydelyngwelde (i.e. Ringwould), Tonge and Whitstable. Bartholomew&#x27;s possessions in this county included Chilham Castle and Leeds Castle.
* Oxfordshire: The manor of Finmere.
* Shropshire: The manors of Adderley and Ideshale (at Shifnal).
* Suffolk: The manors of Barrow and Brendebradefeld (i.e. Bradfield Combust).
* Sussex: The manors of Eastbourne and Laughton. Also reversions of the manors of Drayton, Etchingham and West Dean.
* Wiltshire: The manors of Castle Combe, Knook, Orcheston and West Heytesbury

The relevant inquisitions post mortem also contain details of numerous advowsons and other property rights that Bartholomew owned.

==Family==
Bartholomew married Margaret de Clare, childless widow of Gilbert Umfraville, son of Gilbert Umfraville, 2nd Earl of Angus. The marriage had taken place by 30 June 1308, when the couple were jointly granted the manor of Bourne, Sussex. Margaret was a daughter of Thomas de Clare and his wife Juliana FitzGerald. A comprehensive overview of their children can be seen in the records of numerous inquisitions post mortem that were held after the death of their son Giles on 7 June 1338. The evidence given at each hearing rested on local knowledge and there were some inconsistencies about the names of Giles&#x27; sisters and their precise ages. However, taken as a whole, it is clear from the inquisition records that the names of Bartholomew&#x27;s children were as follows, listed in descending order of age: 
*Margery de Badlesmere, married William de Ros, 2nd Baron de Ros of Helmsley (Hamlake)
*Maud de Badlesmere, married Robert FitzPayn, then John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford
*Elizabeth de Badlesmere, married Sir Edmund Mortimer, then William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton
*Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere, married Elizabeth Montagu, and died without issue
*Margaret de Badlesmere, married John Tiptoft, 2nd Baron Tibetot. Her tomb was at the Ipswich Greyfriars.

<text>The Q-code is a standardised collection of three-letter codes that each start with the letter &quot;Q&quot;. It is an operating signal initially developed for commercial radiotelegraph communication and later adopted by other radio services, especially amateur radio. To distinguish the use of a Q-code transmitted as a question from the same Q-code transmitted as a statement, operators either prefixed it with the military network question marker &quot;&quot; () or suffixed it with the standard Morse question mark ().

Although Q-codes were created when radio used Morse code exclusively, they continued to be employed after the introduction of voice transmissions. To avoid confusion, transmitter call signs are restricted; countries can be issued unused Q-Codes as their ITU prefix e.g. Qatar is QAT.

Codes in the range QAA–QNZ are reserved for aeronautical use; QOA–QQZ for maritime use and QRA–QUZ for all services.

&quot;Q&quot; has no official meaning, but it is sometimes assigned a word with mnemonic value, such as &quot;question&quot; or &quot;query&quot;, for example in QFE: &quot;query field elevation&quot;.

==Early development==
The original Q-codes were created, &quot;circa&quot; 1909, by the British government as a &quot;List of abbreviations ... prepared for the use of British ships and coast stations licensed by the Postmaster General&quot;. The Q-codes facilitated communication between maritime radio operators speaking different languages, so they were soon adopted internationally. A total of forty-five Q-codes appeared in the &quot;List of Abbreviations to be used in Radio Communications&quot;, which was included in the Service Regulations affixed to the Second International Radiotelegraph Convention in London (The Convention was signed on July 5, 1912, and became effective July 1, 1913.)

The following table reviews a sample of the all-services Q-codes adopted by the 1912 convention:
==Later use==
Over the years the original Q-codes were modified to reflect changes in radio practice. For example, QSW / QSX originally stood for, &quot;Shall I increase / decrease my spark frequency?&quot;, but in the 1920s spark-gap transmitters were gradually being banned from land stations, making that meaning obsolete. By the 1970s, the &quot;Post Office Handbook for Radio Operators&quot; listed over a hundred Q-codes, covering a wide range of subjects including radio procedures, meteorology, radio direction finding, and search and rescue.

Some Q-codes are also used in aviation, in particular QNE, QNH and QFE, referring to certain altimeter settings. These codes are used in radiotelephone conversations with air traffic control as unambiguous shorthand, where safety and efficiency are of vital importance. A subset of Q-codes is used by the Miami-Dade County, Florida local government for law enforcement and fire rescue communications, one of the few instances where Q-codes are used in ground voice communication.

The QAA–QNZ code range includes phrases applicable primarily to the aeronautical service, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The QOA–QQZ code range is reserved for the maritime service. The QRA–QUZ code range includes phrases applicable to all services and is allocated to the International Telecommunication Union. QVA–QZZ are not allocated. Many codes have no immediate applicability outside one individual service, such as maritime operation (many QO or QU series codes) or radioteletype operation (the QJ series).

Many military and other organisations that use Morse code have adopted additional codes, including the Z code used by most European and NATO countries. The Z code adds commands and questions adapted for military radio transmissions, for example, &quot;ZBW 2&quot;, which means &quot;change to backup frequency number 2&quot;, and &quot;ZNB abc&quot;, which means &quot;my checksum is abc, what is yours?&quot;

Used in their formal question / answer sense, the meaning of a Q-code varies depending on whether the individual Q-code is sent as a question or an answer. For example, the message &quot;QRP?&quot; means &quot;Shall I decrease transmitter power?&quot;, and a reply of &quot;QRP&quot; means &quot;Yes, decrease your transmitter power&quot;, whereas an unprompted statement &quot;QRP&quot; means &quot;Please decrease your transmitter power&quot;. This structured use of Q-codes is fairly rare and now mainly limited to amateur radio and military Morse code (CW) traffic networks.

==Listing according to service==
*QAA to QNZ – Assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
*QNA to QNZ – The American Radio Relay League (ARRL) has also developed its own QN Signals for message handling located in this range. Even though they overlap with other signals, the ARRL determined that their exclusive use in NTS nets limits confusion.
*QOA to QQZ – For the Maritime Mobile Service.
*QRA to QUZ – Assigned by the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R).

===Aeronautical Code signals (QAA–QNZ; ICAO)===
First defined in ICAO publication &quot;Doc 6100-COM/504/1&quot; and in &quot;ICAO Procedures for Air Navigation Services, Abbreviations and Codes (PANS-ABC)&quot; [Doc8400-4] (4th edition 1989), the majority of the Q-codes have fallen out of common use; for example today reports such as QAU (&quot;I am about to jettison fuel&quot;) and QAZ (&quot;I am flying in a storm&quot;) would be voice or computerised transmissions. But several remain part of the standard ICAO radiotelephony phraseology in aviation. These are also part of ACP131, which lists all ITU-R Q-codes, without grouping them by aeronautical/marine/general use.

===Maritime Mobile Service (QOA–QQZ)===
This assignment is specified in &quot;RECOMMENDATION ITU-R M.1172&quot;.

Q signals are not substantially used in the maritime service. Morse code is now very rarely used for maritime communications, but in isolated maritime regions like Antarctica and the South Pacific the use of Q-codes continues. Q-codes still work when HF voice circuits are not possible due to atmospherics and the nearest vessel is one ionospheric hop away.

===All services (QRA–QUZ)===
First defined by the Washington 1927 ITU Radio Regulations. Later defined by ITU-R in Appendix 9 to the Radio Regulations Annex to the &quot;International Telecommunications Convention&quot; (Atlantic City, 1947). The current callsign table is found in ITU-R Appendix 42. Current interpretation of the Q-code can be found in ITU-R Appendices 14 and 15.

ITU Radio Regulations 1990, Appendix 13: Miscellaneous Abbreviations and Signals to be Used in Radiotelegraphy Communications Except in the Maritime Mobile Service:


===Amateur radio===
Amateur radio has adapted two different sets of Q-codes for use in amateur communications. The first set comes from the ITU civil series QRA through QUZ. Most of the meanings are identical to the ITU definitions, however, they must be looked at in the context of amateur communications. For example, QSJ? asks what the charges are for sending the telegraph. Since by regulation amateur communications are without charge, this Q-code couldn&#x27;t make sense.

The second set is the set of QN Signals, used only in ARRL NTS nets. These operating signals generally have no equivalent in the ACP 131 publication or ITU publications, and are specifically defined only for use in ARRL NTS nets. They are not used in casual amateur radio communications.

Selected Q-codes were soon adopted by amateur radio operators. In December 1915, the American Radio Relay League began publication of a magazine titled &quot;QST&quot;, named after the Q-code for &quot;General call to all stations&quot;. In amateur radio, the Q-codes were originally used in Morse code transmissions to shorten lengthy phrases and were followed by a Morse code question mark () if the phrase was a question.

Q-codes are commonly used in voice communications as shorthand nouns, verbs, and adjectives making up phrases. For example, an amateur radio operator will complain about QRM (man-made interference), or tell another operator that there is &quot;QSB on the signal&quot; (fading); &quot;to QSY&quot; is to change your operating frequency, or to break in on a conversation QSK is often used even on VHF and UHF frequencies. (See also Informal usage, below.)

====Q-codes as adapted for use in amateur radio====

====Notes for response to radiotelegraph Q-codes====
Responses to a radiotelegraph Q-code query or a Q-code assertion may vary depending upon the code. For Q-code assertions or queries which only need to be acknowledged as received, the usual practice is to respond with the letter &quot;R&quot; for &quot;Roger&quot; which means &quot;Received correctly&quot;. Sending an &quot;R&quot; merely means the code has been correctly received and does not necessarily mean that the receiving operator has taken any other action.

For Q-code queries that need to be answered in the affirmative, the usual practice is to respond with the letter &quot;C&quot; (Sounds like the Spanish word &quot;Si&quot;). For Q-code queries that need to be answered in the negative, the usual practice it to respond with the letter &quot;N&quot; for &quot;no&quot;. For those Q-code assertions that merely need to be acknowledged as understood, the usual practice is to respond with the prosign (or ) which means &quot;understood&quot;. On telegraph cable networks &quot;KK&quot; was often used at the end of a reply to a Q-code to mean &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Acknowledged&quot;. This practice predates amateur radio as telegraph operators in the late 19th century are known to have used it.

====Informal usage====
QAC - Taken from the Articles of Association of the South Hampshire International Telegraphy Society, para 9: &quot;...and amongst themselves they shall promote the Use of the Code QAC, which shall be taken as implying &quot;All Compliments&quot; and shall include:- VY 73 73 OM CUL BCNU &amp; mni tnx fer nice/FB/rotten QSO GL GB hpe cuagn wid gud/btr/wrse condx mri Xms Hpi Nw Yr mni hpi rtrns gtgs fer Rosh Hoshanah/Id el Fitr/May Day/Tksgvg 88 to XYL/YL/Widow Ciao Cheerio &amp; gud/FB/best DX or any Part or Parts thereof in any Permutation or Combination.

QLF – &quot;Are you sending with your left foot? Try sending with your left foot!&quot; A humorously derogatory comment about the quality of a person&#x27;s sending.

QNB – QNB? “How many buttons on your radio?” “QNB 100/5” Means there are 100 and I know what 5 of them do.

QSK – &quot;I can hear you during my transmission&quot; – refers to a particular mode of Morse code operating often called QSK operation (full break-in) in which the receiver is quickly enabled during the spaces between the dits and dahs, which allows another operator to interrupt transmissions. Many modern transceivers incorporate this function, sometimes referred to as &quot;full break-in&quot; as against &quot;semi-break-in&quot; in which there is a short delay before the transceiver goes to receive.

QSY – &quot;Change to transmission on another frequency&quot;; colloquially, &quot;move [=change address]&quot;. E.g., &quot;When did GKB QSY from Northolt to Portishead?&quot;

QTH – &quot;My location is ____&quot;; colloquially in voice or writing, &quot;location&quot;. E.g., &quot;The OCF &quot;[antenna type]&quot; is an interesting build but at my QTH a disappointing performer.&quot;

QTHR – &quot;At the registered location ____&quot;; chiefly British use. Historically, the location in the printed Callbook; modernly, &quot;as given in online government records for my callsign&quot;. E.g., &quot;You can contact me QTHR&quot;.

QBL – “Quit Bein&#x27; a Lid” QBL is used among amateur radio operators to indicate humour in their CW transmission. While QBL is generally used by a small subsection of operators who can properly decode, it is available to anyone.

====German use during World War II====
During World War II, according to Bletchley Park’s &quot;General Report on Tunny,&quot; German radio teleprinter networks used Q-codes to establish and maintain circuit connections.

In particular: QKP [ought to be &#x27;QEP&#x27;, not &#x27;QKP&#x27; - the print in the source document isn&#x27;t very clear] was to indicate the Lorenz cipher machine setting for each message and, QZZ to indicate that the daily key change was about to take place at the sender&#x27;s station.

<text>The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus, often shortened to Titus Andronicus, is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1588 and 1593. It is thought to be Shakespeare&#x27;s first tragedy and is often seen as his attempt to emulate the violent and bloody revenge plays of his contemporaries, which were extremely popular with audiences throughout the 16th century. 

Titus, a general in the Roman army, presents Tamora, Queen of the Goths, as a slave to the new Roman emperor, Saturninus. Saturninus takes her as his wife. From this position, Tamora vows revenge against Titus for killing her son. Titus and his family retaliate, leading to a cycle of violence.

&quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; was initially very popular, but by the later 17th century it was not well esteemed. The Victorian era disapproved of it, largely because of its graphic violence. Its reputation began to improve around the middle of the 20th century, but it is still one of Shakespeare&#x27;s least respected plays.

==Synopsis==

Shortly after the death of the Roman emperor, his two sons, Saturninus and Bassianus, quarrel over who will succeed him. Their conflict seems set to boil over into violence until a tribune, Marcus Andronicus, announces that the people&#x27;s choice for the new emperor is his brother, Titus, who will shortly return to Rome from a victorious ten-year campaign against the Goths. Titus arrives to much fanfare, bearing with him as prisoners Tamora, Queen of the Goths; her three sons Alarbus, Chiron, and Demetrius; and her secret lover, Aaron the Moor. Despite Tamora&#x27;s desperate pleas, Titus sacrifices her eldest son, Alarbus, to avenge the deaths of twenty-one of his own sons during the war. Distraught, Tamora and her two surviving sons vow to obtain revenge on Titus and his family.

Meanwhile, Titus refuses the offer of the throne, arguing that he is not fit to rule and instead supporting the claim of Saturninus, who then is duly elected. Saturninus tells Titus that for his first act as emperor, he will marry Titus&#x27;s daughter Lavinia. Titus agrees, although Lavinia is already betrothed to Saturninus&#x27;s brother, Bassianus, who refuses to give her up. Titus&#x27;s sons tell Titus that Bassianus is in the right under Roman law, but Titus refuses to listen, accusing them all of treason. A scuffle breaks out, during which Titus kills his own son, Mutius. Saturninus then denounces the Andronici family for their effrontery and shocks Titus by marrying Tamora. Putting into motion her plan for revenge, Tamora advises Saturninus to pardon Bassianus and the Andronici family, which he reluctantly does.

During a royal hunt the following day, Aaron persuades Demetrius and Chiron to kill Bassianus so that they may rape Lavinia. They do so, throwing Bassianus&#x27;s body into a pit and dragging Lavinia deep into the forest before violently raping her. To keep her from revealing what has happened, they cut out her tongue and cut off her hands. Meanwhile, Aaron writes a forged letter, which frames Titus&#x27;s sons Martius and Quintus for the murder of Bassianus. Horrified at the death of his brother, Saturninus arrests Martius and Quintus and sentences them to death.

Some time later, Marcus discovers the mutilated Lavinia and takes her to her father, who is still shocked at the accusations levelled at his sons, and upon seeing Lavinia, he is overcome with grief. Aaron then visits Titus and falsely tells him that Saturninus will spare Martius and Quintus if either Titus, Marcus, or Titus&#x27; remaining son, Lucius, cuts off one of their hands and sends it to him. Though Marcus and Lucius are willing, Titus has his own left hand cut off by Aaron and sends it to the emperor. However, a messenger brings back Martius&#x27;s and Quintus&#x27;s severed heads, along with Titus&#x27;s own severed hand. Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their conquered enemy, the Goths.

Later, Lavinia writes the names of her attackers in the dirt, using a stick held with her mouth and between her arms. Meanwhile, Aaron is informed that Tamora has secretly given birth to a mixed-race baby, fathered by Aaron, which will draw Saturninus&#x27;s wrath. Though Tamora wants the baby killed, Aaron kills the nurse to keep the child&#x27;s race a secret and flees to raise his son among the Goths. Thereafter, Lucius, marching on Rome with an army, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. In order to save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire revenge plot to Lucius.
Back in Rome, Titus&#x27;s behaviour suggests he might be deranged. Convinced of Titus&#x27;s madness, Tamora, Demetrius, and Chiron (dressed as the spirits of &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Murder&quot;, and &quot;Rape&quot;, respectively) approach Titus in order to persuade him to have Lucius remove his troops from Rome. Tamora (as &quot;Revenge&quot;) tells Titus that she will grant him revenge on all of his enemies if he convinces Lucius to postpone the imminent attack on Rome. Titus agrees and sends Marcus to invite Lucius to a reconciliatory feast. Revenge then offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora as well, and is about to leave when Titus insists that Rape and Murder stay with him. When Tamora is gone, Titus has Chiron and Demetrius restrained, cuts their throats, and drains their blood into a basin held by Lavinia. Titus tells Lavinia that he will &quot;play the cook&quot;, grind the bones of Demetrius and Chiron into powder, and bake their heads into two pies, which he will serve to their mother.

The next day, during the feast at his house, Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his daughter when she has been raped. When Saturninus answers that he should, Titus kills Lavinia and tells Saturninus of the rape. When the Emperor calls for Chiron and Demetrius, Titus reveals that they were baked in the pies Tamora has already been eating. Titus then kills Tamora and is immediately killed by Saturninus, who is subsequently killed by Lucius to avenge his father&#x27;s death. Lucius is then proclaimed Emperor. He orders that Titus and Lavinia be laid in their family tomb, that Saturninus be given a state burial, that Tamora&#x27;s body be thrown to the wild beasts outside the city, and that Aaron be hanged. Aaron, however, is unrepentant to the end, regretting only that he did not do more evil in his life. Lucius decides Aaron deserves to be buried chest-deep as punishment and left to die of thirst and starvation, and Aaron is taken away to be punished thus.

== Setting and sources ==
=== Setting ===
The story of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; is fictional, not historical, unlike Shakespeare&#x27;s other Roman plays, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, all of which are based on real historical events and people (or, in the case of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, believed to be historical by late Romans, as well as in Shakespeare&#x27;s time). Even the time in which &quot;Titus&quot; is set may not be based on a real historical period. According to the prose version of the play (see below), the events are &quot;set in the time of Theodosius&quot;, who ruled from 379 to 395. On the other hand, the general setting appears to be what Clifford Huffman describes as &quot;late-Imperial Christian Rome&quot;, possibly during the reign of Justinian I (527–565). Also favouring a later date, Grace Starry West argues,
: &quot;the Rome of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; is Rome after Brutus, after Caesar, and after Ovid. We know it is a later Rome because the emperor is routinely called Caesar; because the characters are constantly alluding to Tarquin, Lucretia, and Brutus, suggesting that they learned about Brutus&#x27; new founding of Rome from the same literary sources we do, Livy and Plutarch.&quot;

Others are less certain of a specific setting, however. For example, Jonathan Bate has pointed out that the play begins with Titus returning from a successful ten-year campaign against the Goths, as if at the height of the Roman Empire, but ends with Goths invading Rome, as if at its death. Similarly, T.J.B. Spencer argues that
: &quot;the play does not assume a political situation known to Roman history; it is, rather a summary of Roman politics. It is not so much that any particular set of political institutions is assumed in &quot;Titus&quot;, but rather that it includes &quot;all&quot; the political institutions that Rome ever had.&quot;

===Sources===

In his efforts to fashion general history into a specific fictional story, Shakespeare may have consulted the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, a well known thirteenth-century collection of tales, legends, myths, and anecdotes written in Latin, which took figures and events from history and spun fictional tales around them. In Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime, a writer known for doing likewise was Matteo Bandello, who based his work on that of writers such as Giovanni Boccaccio and Geoffrey Chaucer, and who could have served as an indirect source for Shakespeare. So, too, could the first major English author to write in this style, William Painter, who borrowed from, amongst others, Herodotus, Plutarch, Aulus Gellius, Claudius Aelianus, Livy, Tacitus, Giovanni Battista Giraldi, and Bandello himself.
However, it is also possible to determine more specific sources for the play. The primary source for the rape and mutilation of Lavinia, as well as Titus&#x27; subsequent revenge, is Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (), which is featured in the play itself when Lavinia uses it to help explain to Titus and Marcus what happened to her during the attack. In the sixth book of &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Ovid tells the story of the rape of Philomela, daughter of Pandion I, King of Athens. Despite ill omens, Philomela&#x27;s sister, Procne, marries Tereus of Thrace and has a son for him, Itys. After five years in Thrace, Procne yearns to see her sister again, so she persuades Tereus to travel to Athens and accompany Philomela back to Thrace. Tereus does so, but he soon begins to lust after Philomela. When she refuses his advances, he drags her into a forest and rapes her. He then cuts out her tongue to prevent her from telling anyone of the incident and returns to Procne, telling her that Philomela is dead. However, Philomela weaves a tapestry, in which she names Tereus as her assailant, and has it sent to Procne. The sisters meet in the forest and together plot their revenge. They kill Itys and cook his body in a pie, which Procne then serves to Tereus. During the meal, Philomela reveals herself, showing Itys&#x27; head to Tereus and telling him what they have done.

For the scene where Lavinia reveals her rapists by writing in the sand, Shakespeare may have used a story from the first book of &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;; the tale of the rape of Io by Zeus, where, to prevent her from divulging the story, he turns her into a cow. Upon encountering her father, she attempts to tell him who she is but is unable to do so until she thinks to scratch her name in the dirt using her hoof.

Titus&#x27;s revenge may also have been influenced by Seneca&#x27;s play &quot;Thyestes&quot;, written in the first century AD. In the mythology of Thyestes, which is the basis for Seneca&#x27;s play, Thyestes, son of Pelops, King of Pisa, who, along with his brother Atreus, was exiled by Pelops for the murder of their half-brother, Chrysippus. They take up refuge in Mycenae and soon ascend to co-inhabit the throne. However, each becomes jealous of the other, and Thyestes tricks Atreus into electing him as the sole king. Determined to re-attain the throne, Atreus enlists the aid of Zeus and Hermes, and has Thyestes banished from Mycenae. Atreus subsequently discovers that his wife, Aerope, had been having an affair with Thyestes, and he vows revenge. He asks Thyestes to return to Mycenae with his family, telling him that all past animosities are forgotten. However, when Thyestes returns, Atreus secretly kills Thyestes&#x27;s sons. He cuts off their hands and heads, and cooks the rest of their bodies in a pie. At a reconciliatory feast, Atreus serves Thyestes the pie in which his sons have been baked. As Thyestes finishes his meal, Atreus produces the hands and heads, revealing to the horrified Thyestes what he has done.

Another specific source for the final scene is discernible when Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his daughter when she has been raped. This is a reference to the story of Verginia from Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot; (). Around 451 BC, a decemvir of the Roman Republic, Appius Claudius Crassus, begins to lust after Verginia, a plebeian girl betrothed to a former tribune, Lucius Icilius. She rejects Claudius&#x27; advances, enraging him, and he has her abducted. However, both Icilius and Verginia&#x27;s father, famed centurion Lucius Verginius, are respected figures and Claudius is forced to legally defend his right to hold Verginia. At the Forum, Claudius threatens the assembly with violence, and Verginius&#x27; supporters flee. Seeing that defeat is imminent, Verginius asks Claudius if he may speak to his daughter alone, to which Claudius agrees. However, Verginius stabs Verginia, determining that her death is the only way he can secure her freedom.

For the scene where Aaron tricks Titus into cutting off one of his hands, the primary source was probably an unnamed popular tale about a Moor&#x27;s vengeance, published in various languages throughout the sixteenth century (an English version entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register in 1569 has not survived). In the story, a married nobleman with two children chastises his Moorish servant, who vows revenge. The servant goes to the moated tower where the man&#x27;s wife and children live, and rapes the wife. Her screams bring her husband, but the Moor pulls up the drawbridge before the nobleman can gain entry. The Moor then kills both children on the battlements in full view of the man. The nobleman pleads with the Moor that he will do anything to save his wife, and the Moor demands he cut off his nose. The man does so, but the Moor kills the wife anyway, and the nobleman dies of shock. The Moor then flings himself from the battlements to avoid punishment.

Shakespeare also drew on various sources for the names of many of his characters. For example, Titus could have been named after the Emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus, who ruled Rome from 79 to 81. Jonathan Bate speculates that the name &#x27;Andronicus&#x27; could have come from Andronicus V Palaeologus, co-emperor of Byzantium from 1403 to 1407, but, since there is no reason to suppose that Shakespeare might have come across these emperors, it is more likely that he took the name from the story &quot;Andronicus and the lion&quot; in Antonio de Guevara&#x27;s &quot;Epistolas familiares&quot;. That story involves a sadistic emperor named Titus who amused himself by throwing slaves to wild animals and watching them be slaughtered. However, when a slave called Andronicus is thrown to a lion, the lion lies down and embraces the man. The emperor demands to know what has happened, and Andronicus explains that he had once helped the lion by removing a thorn from its foot. Bate speculates that this story, with one character called Titus and another called Andronicus, could be why several contemporary references to the play are in the form &quot;Titus &amp; Ondronicus&quot;.

Geoffrey Bullough argues that Lucius&#x27;s character arc (estrangement from his father, followed by banishment, followed by a glorious return to avenge his family honour) was probably based on Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Coriolanus&quot;. As for Lucius&#x27; name, Frances Yates speculates that he may be named after Saint Lucius, who introduced Christianity into Britain. On the other hand, Jonathan Bate hypothesises that Lucius could be named after Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic, arguing that &quot;the man who led the people in their uprising was Lucius Junius Brutus. This is the role that Lucius fulfills in the play.&quot;

The name of Lavinia was probably taken from the mythological figure of Lavinia, daughter of Latinus, King of Latium, who, in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, courts Aeneas as he attempts to settle his people in Latium. A. C. Hamilton speculates that the name of Tamora could have been based upon the historical figure of Tomyris, a violent and uncompromising Massagetae queen. Eugene M. Waith suggests that the name of Tamora&#x27;s son, Alarbus, could have come from George Puttenham&#x27;s &quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot; (1589), which contains the line &quot;the Roman prince did daunt/Wild Africans and the lawless Alarbes.&quot; G. K. Hunter has suggested Shakespeare may have taken Saturninus&#x27;s name from Herodian&#x27;s &quot;History of the Empire from the Death of Marcus&quot;, which features a jealous and violent tribune named Saturninus. On the other hand, Waith speculates that Shakespeare may have been thinking of an astrological theory which he could have seen in Guy Marchant&#x27;s &quot;The Kalendayr of the shyppars&quot; (1503), which states that Saturnine men (i.e. men born under the influence of Saturn) are &quot;false, envious and malicious.&quot;

Shakespeare most likely took the names of Caius, Demetrius, Marcus, Martius, Quintus, Æmilius, and Sempronius from Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Scipio Africanus&quot;. Bassianus&#x27;s name probably came from Lucius Septimius Bassianus, better known as Caracalla, who, like Bassianus in the play, fights with his brother over succession, one appealing to primogeniture and the other to popularity.

===Ballad, prose history, and source debate===
Any discussion of the sources of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; is complicated by the existence of two other versions of the story; a prose history and a ballad; both are anonymous and undated.
Ultimately, there is no clear critical consensus on the issue of the order in which the &quot;play&quot;, &quot;prose&quot;, and &quot;ballad&quot; were written, with the only tentative agreement being that at the latest, all three were probably in existence by 1594.

The first definite reference to the ballad &quot;Titus Andronicus&#x27; Complaint&quot; is an entry in the Stationers&#x27; Register by the printer John Danter on 6 February 1594, where the entry &quot;A booke intitled a Noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus&quot; is immediately followed by &quot;Entred also vnto[&quot;sic&quot;] him, the ballad thereof&quot;. The earliest surviving copy of the ballad is in Richard Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Garland of Princely Pleasures and Delicate Delights&quot; (1620), but the date of its composition is unknown.

The prose was first published in chapbook form some time between 1736–1764 by Cluer Dicey under the title &quot;The History of Titus Andronicus, the Renowned Roman General&quot; (the ballad was also included in the chapbook), however it is believed to be much older than that. The copyright records from the Stationers&#x27; Register in Shakespeare&#x27;s own lifetime provide some tenuous evidence regarding the dating of the prose. On 19 April 1602, the publisher Thomas Millington sold his share in the copyright of &quot;A booke intitled a Noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus&quot; (which Danter had initially entered into the Register in 1594) to Thomas Pavier. The orthodox belief is that this entry refers to the play.

The next version of the play to be published was for Edward White, in 1611, printed by Edward Allde, thus prompting the question of why Pavier never published the play, despite having owned the copyright for nine years. J.Q. Adams believes that the original Danter entry in 1594 is not a reference to the play but instead to the prose version, and that the subsequent transferrals of copyright relate to the prose, not the play, explaining why the play was never published by Pavier. Similarly, Greg believes that all copyright to the play lapsed upon Danter&#x27;s death in 1600, hence the 1602 transferral from Millington to Pavier was illegitimate unless it refers to something other than the play; i.e. the prose. Both scholars conclude that the evidence seems to imply the prose existed by early 1594 at the latest.

However, even if the prose version existed in 1594, there is no solid evidence to suggest the order in which the play, ballad, and prose were written, and which served as source for which. Traditionally, the prose has been seen as the original, with the play derived from it, and the ballad derived from both play and prose. Adams, for example, firmly believed in this order (&quot;prose-play-ballad&quot;) as did John Dover Wilson and Geoffrey Bullough. This theory is by no means universally accepted however. For example, R.M. Sargent agrees with Adams and Bullough that the prose was the source of the play, but he argues that the poem was also a source of the play (&quot;prose-ballad-play&quot;).

Marco Mincoff rejects both theories, arguing instead that the play came first, and served as a source for both the ballad and the prose (&quot;play-ballad-prose&quot;). G.H. Metz felt that Mincoff was incorrect and reasserted the primacy of the prose-play-ballad sequence. G.K. Hunter however, believes that Adams, Dover Wilson, Bullough, Sargent, Mincoff, and Metz were &quot;all&quot; wrong, and the play was the source for the prose, with both serving as sources for the ballad (&quot;play-prose-ballad&quot;). In his 1984 edition of the play for &quot;The Oxford Shakespeare&quot;, E.M. Waith rejects Hunter&#x27;s theory and supports the original prose-play-ballad sequence.

On the other hand, Jonathan Bate favours Mincoff&#x27;s theory of &quot;play-ballad-prose&quot;, in his 1995 edition for the &quot;Arden Shakespeare&quot; (3rd series). In the introduction to the 2001 edition of the play for the &quot;Penguin Shakespeare&quot; (edited by Sonia Massai), Jacques Berthoud agrees with Waith and settles on the initial &quot;prose-play-ballad&quot; sequence. In his 2006 revised edition for the &quot;New Cambridge Shakespeare&quot;, Alan Hughes also argues for the original &quot;prose-play-ballad&quot; hypothesis, but proposes that the source for the ballad was exclusively the prose, not the play.

==Date and text==

===Date===
The earliest known record of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; is found in Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary on 24 January 1594, where Henslowe recorded a performance by Sussex&#x27;s Men of &quot;Titus &amp; ondronicus&quot;, probably at The Rose. Henslowe marked the play as &quot;ne&quot;, which most critics take to mean &quot;new&quot;. There were subsequent performances on 29 January and 6 February. Also on 6 February, the printer John Danter entered into the &quot;Stationers&#x27; Register&quot; &quot;A booke intitled a Noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus&quot;. Later in 1594, Danter published the play in quarto under the title The Most Lamentable Romaine Tragedie of Titus Andronicus (referred to by scholars as Q1) for the booksellers Edward White and Thomas Millington, making it the first of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to be printed. This evidence establishes that the latest possible date of composition is late 1593.

One of the two known copies of the second edition of Titus Andronicus is a part of The University of Edinburgh Heritage Collection. This was donated by William Hog in 1700. In the 1860s this copy was lent to Shakespeare scholar and collector James Orchard Halliwell-Phillips so he could make a facsimile. This arrangement, brokered by David Laing, eventually led to Halliwell-Phillips donating a vast collection of books and manuscripts to Edinburgh University Library. 

There is evidence, however, that the play may have been written some years earlier than this. In 1614, Ben Jonson wrote in a preface to &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; that &quot;He that will swear, &quot;Jeronimo&quot; or &quot;Andronicus&quot; are the best plays, yet shall pass unexcepted at, here, as a man whose judgement shows it is constant, and hath stood still these five and twenty, or thirty years.&quot; The success and popularity of Thomas Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;, to which Jonson alludes, is attested by many contemporary documents, so by placing &quot;Titus&quot; alongside it, Jonson is saying that &quot;Titus&quot; too must have been extremely popular in its day, but by 1614, both plays had come to be seen as old fashioned. If Jonson is taken literally, for the play to have been between 25 and 30 years old in 1614, it must have been written between 1584 and 1589, a theory which not all scholars reject out of hand. For example, in his 1953 edition of the play for the &quot;Arden Shakespeare&quot; 2nd Series, J.C. Maxwell argues for a date of late 1589. Similarly, E.A.J. Honigmann, in his &#x27;early start&#x27; theory of 1982, suggests that Shakespeare wrote the play several years before coming to London , and that &quot;Titus&quot; was actually his first play, written . In his &quot;Cambridge Shakespeare&quot; edition of 1994 and again in 2006, Alan Hughes makes a similar argument, believing the play was written very early in Shakespeare&#x27;s career, before he came to London, possibly .

However, the majority of scholars tend to favour a post-1590 date, and one of the primary arguments for this is that the title page of Q1 assigns the play to three different playing companies; Derby&#x27;s Men, Pembroke&#x27;s Men and Sussex&#x27;s Men (&quot;As it was Plaide by the Right Honourable the Earle of Darbie, Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of Suſſex their Seruants&quot;). This is highly unusual in copies of Elizabethan plays, which usually refer to one company only, if any. If the order of the listing is chronological, as Eugene M. Waith and Jacques Berthoud, for example, believe it is, it means that Sussex&#x27;s Men were the last to perform the play, suggesting it had been on stage quite some time prior to 24 January 1594. Waith hypothesises that the play originally belonged to Derby&#x27;s Men, but after the closure of the London theatres on 23 June 1592 due to an outbreak of plague, Derby&#x27;s Men sold the play to Pembroke&#x27;s Men, who were going on a regional tour to Bath and Ludlow. The tour was a financial failure, and the company returned to London on 28 September, financially ruined. At that point, they sold the play to Sussex&#x27;s Men, who would go on to perform it on 24 January 1594 at The Rose. If one accepts this theory, it suggests a date of composition as some time in early to mid-1592. However, Jonathan Bate and Alan Hughes have argued that there is no evidence that the listing is chronological, and no precedent on other title pages for making that assumption. Additionally, a later edition of the play gives a different order of acting companies – Pembroke&#x27;s Men, Derby&#x27;s Men, Sussex&#x27; Men and Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, suggesting the order is random and cannot be used to help date the play.

As such, even amongst scholars who favour a post-1590 date, 1592 is by no means universally accepted. Jacques Berthoud, for example, argues that Shakespeare had close associations with Derby&#x27;s Men and &quot;it would seem that &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; must already have entered the repertoire of Derby&#x27;s Men by the end of 1591 or the start of 1592 at the latest.&quot; Berthoud believes this places the date of composition some time in 1591. Another theory is provided by Jonathan Bate, who finds it significant that Q1 lacks the &quot;sundry times&quot; comment found on virtually every sixteenth-century play; the claim on a title page that a play had been performed &quot;sundry times&quot; was an attempt by publishers to emphasise its popularity, and its absence on Q1 indicates that the play was so new, it hadn&#x27;t been performed anywhere. Bate also finds significance in the fact that prior to the rape of Lavinia, Chiron and Demetrius vow to use Bassianus&#x27; body as a pillow. Bate believes this connects the play to Thomas Nashe&#x27;s &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot;, which was completed on 27 June 1593. Verbal similarities between &quot;Titus&quot; and George Peele&#x27;s poem &quot;The Honour of the Garter&quot; are also important for Bate. The poem was written to celebrate the installation of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland as a Knight of the Garter on 26 June 1593. Bate takes these three pieces of evidence to suggest a timeline which sees Shakespeare complete his &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy prior to the closing of the theatres in June 1592. At this time, he turns to classical antiquity to aid him in his poems &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. Then, towards the end of 1593, with the prospect of the theatres being reopened, and with the classical material still fresh in his mind, he wrote &quot;Titus&quot; as his first tragedy, shortly after reading Nashe&#x27;s novel and Peele&#x27;s poem, all of which suggests a date of composition of late 1593.

Other critics have attempted to use more scientific methods to determine the date of the play. For example, Gary Taylor has employed stylometry, particularly the study of contractions, colloquialisms, rare words and function words. Taylor concludes that the entire play except Act 3, Scene 2 was written just after &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; and &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, which he assigns to late 1591 or early 1592. As such, Taylor settles on a date of mid-1592 for &quot;Titus&quot;. He also argues that 3.2, which is only found in the 1623 Folio text, was written contemporaneously with &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, in late 1593.
However, if the play was written and performed by 1588 (Hughes), 1589 (Maxwell), 1591 (Berthoud), 1592 (Waith and Taylor), or 1593 (Bate), why did Henslowe refer to it as &quot;ne&quot; in 1594? R.A. Foakes and R.T. Rickert, modern editors of &quot;Henslowe&#x27;s Diary&quot;, argue that &quot;ne&quot; could refer to a newly licensed play, which would make sense if one accepts Waith&#x27;s argument that Pembroke&#x27;s Men had sold the rights to Sussex&#x27;s Men upon returning from their failed tour of the provinces. Foakes and Rickert also point out that &quot;ne&quot; could refer to a newly revised play, suggesting editing on Shakespeare&#x27;s part some time in late 1593. Waith sees this suggestion as especially important insofar as John Dover Wilson and Gary Taylor have shown that the text as it exists in Q1 &quot;does&quot; seem to indicate editing. However, that &quot;ne&quot; does actually stand for &quot;new&quot; is not fully accepted; in 1991, Winifred Frazer argued that &quot;ne&quot; is actually an abbreviation for &quot;Newington Butts&quot;. Brian Vickers, amongst others, finds Frazer&#x27;s arguments convincing, which renders interpretation of Henslow&#x27;s entry even more complex.

===Text===
The 1594 quarto text of the play, with the same title, was reprinted by James Roberts for Edward White in 1600 (Q2). On 19 April 1602, Millington sold his share in the copyright to Thomas Pavier. However, the next version of the play was published again for White, in 1611, under the slightly altered title &quot;The Most Lamentable Tragedie of Titus Andronicus&quot;, printed by Edward Allde (Q3).

Q1 is considered a &#x27;good text&#x27; (i.e. not a bad quarto or a reported text), and it forms the basis for most modern editions of the play. Q2 appears to be based on a damaged copy of Q1, as it is missing a number of lines which are replaced by what appear to be guess work on the part of the compositor. This is especially noticeable at the end of the play where four lines of dialogue have been added to Lucius&#x27; closing speech; &quot;See justice done on Aaron, that damned Moor,/By whom our heavy haps had their beginning;/Then afterwards to order well the state,/That like events may ne&#x27;er it ruinate.&quot; Scholars tend to assume that when the compositor got to the last page and saw the damage, he presumed some lines were missing, when in fact none were. Q2 was considered the control text until 1904, when the copy of Q1 now at the Folger Shakespeare Library was discovered in Sweden. Together with a 1594 printing of &quot;Henry VI, Part II&quot;, the Folger&#x27;s Q1 &quot;Titus&quot; is the earliest extant printed Shakespearean play. Q2 also corrects a number of minor errors in Q1. Q3 is a further degradation of Q2, and includes a number of corrections to the Q2 text, but introduces many more errors.

The &quot;First Folio&quot; text of 1623 (F1), under the title &quot;The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus&quot;, is based primarily on the Q3 text (which is why modern editors use Q1 as the control rather than the usual practice in Shakespeare of using the &quot;Folio&quot; text). However, the &quot;Folio&quot; text includes material found in none of the quarto editions, primarily Act 3, Scene 2 (also called the &#x27;fly-killing scene&#x27;). It is believed that while Q3 was probably the main source for the &quot;Folio&quot;, an annotated prompter&#x27;s copy was also used, particularly in relation to stage directions, which differ significantly from all of the quarto texts.

As such, the text of the play that is today known as &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; involves a combination of material from Q1 and F1, the vast majority of which is taken from Q1.

===The Peacham drawing===

An important piece of evidence relating to both the dating and text of &quot;Titus&quot; is the so-called &#x27;Peacham drawing&#x27; or &#x27;Longleat manuscript&#x27;; the only surviving contemporary Shakespearean illustration, now residing in the library of the Marquess of Bath at Longleat. The drawing appears to depict a performance of &quot;Titus&quot;, under which is quoted some dialogue. Eugene M. Waith argues of the illustration that &quot;the gestures and costumes give us a more vivid impression of the visual impact of Elizabethan acting than we get from any other source.&quot;

Far from being an acknowledged source of evidence however, the document has provoked varying interpretations, with its date in particular often called into question. The fact that the text reproduced in the drawing seems to borrow from Q1, Q2, Q3 &quot;and&quot; F1, while also inventing some of its own readings, further complicates matters. Additionally, a possible association with Shakespearean forger John Payne Collier has served to undermine its authenticity, while some scholars believe it depicts a play other than &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, and is therefore of limited use to Shakespeareans.

==Analysis and criticism==

===Critical history===
Although &quot;Titus&quot; was extremely popular in its day, over the course of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries it became perhaps Shakespeare&#x27;s most maligned play, and it was only in the latter half of the 20th century that this pattern of denigration showed any signs of subsiding.

One of the earliest critical disparagements of the play occurred in 1687, in the introduction to Edward Ravenscroft&#x27;s theatrical adaptation, &quot;Titus Andronicus, or the Rape of Lavinia. A Tragedy, Alter&#x27;d from Mr. Shakespeare&#x27;s Works&quot;. Speaking of the original play, Ravenscroft wrote,
:&quot; &#x27;tis the most incorrect and indigested piece in all his works. It seems rather a heap of rubbish than a structure.&quot;

In 1765, Samuel Johnson questioned the possibility of even staging the play, pointing out that
: &quot;the barbarity of the spectacles, and the general massacre which are here exhibited, can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any audience.&quot;

In 1811, August Wilhelm Schlegel wrote that the play was
: &quot;framed according to a false idea of the tragic, which by an accumulation of cruelties and enormities, degenerated into the horrible and yet leaves no deep impression behind.&quot;

In 1927, T. S. Eliot argued that it was
: &quot;one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written, a play in which it is incredible that Shakespeare had any hand at all, a play in which the best passages would be too highly honoured by the signature of Peele.&quot;

In 1948, John Dover Wilson wrote that the play
: &quot;seems to jolt and bump along like some broken-down cart, laden with bleeding corpses from an Elizabethan scaffold, and driven by an executioner from Bedlam dressed in cap and bells.&quot;

He goes on to say that if the play had been by anyone other than Shakespeare, it would have been lost and forgotten; it is only because tradition holds that Shakespeare wrote it (which Dover Wilson highly suspects) that it is remembered, not for any intrinsic qualities of its own.

However, although the play continued to have its detractors, it began to acquire its champions as well. In his 1998 book, &quot;&quot;, Harold Bloom defended &quot;Titus&quot; from various critical attacks it has had over the years, insisting the play is meant to be a &quot;parody&quot; and it is only bad &quot;if you take it straight&quot;. He claims the uneven reactions audiences have had are a result of directors misunderstanding Shakespeare&#x27;s intent, which was &quot;mocking and exploiting Marlowe&quot;, and its only suitable director would be Mel Brooks.

Another champion came in 2001, when Jacques Berthoud pointed out that until shortly after World War II, &quot;&quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; was taken seriously only by a handful of textual and bibliographic scholars. Readers, when they could be found, mostly regarded it as a contemptible farrago of violence and bombast, while theatrical managers treated it as either a script in need of radical rewriting, or as a show-biz opportunity for a star actor.&quot; By 2001 however, this was no longer the case, as many prominent scholars had come out in defence of the play.

One such scholar was Jan Kott. Speaking of its apparent gratuitous violence, Kott argued that

In his 1987 edition of the play for the &quot;Contemporary Shakespeare&quot; series, A. L. Rowse speculates as to why the fortunes of the play have begun to change during the 20th century:
: &quot;in the civilised Victorian age the play could not be performed because it could not be believed. Such is the horror of our own age, with the appalling barbarities of prison camps and resistance movements paralleling the torture and mutilation and feeding on human flesh of the play, that it has ceased to be improbable.&quot;
Director Julie Taymor, who staged a production Off-Broadway in 1994 and directed a film version in 1999, says she was drawn to the play because she found it to be the &quot; relevant of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays for the modern era&quot;. As she believes we live in the most violent period in history, Taymor feels that the play has acquired more relevance for us than it had for the Victorians; &quot;it seems like a play written for today, it reeks of now&quot;.

Jonathan Forman, when he reviewed Taymor&#x27;s film for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, agreed and stated:
: &quot;It is the Shakespeare play for our time, a work of art that speaks directly to the age of Rwanda and Bosnia.&quot;

====Authorship====

Perhaps the most frequently discussed topic in the play&#x27;s critical history is that of authorship. None of the three quarto editions of &quot;Titus&quot; name the author, which was normal for Elizabethan plays. However, Francis Meres does list the play as one of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies in &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; in 1598. Additionally, John Heminges and Henry Condell felt sure enough of Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship to include it in the &quot;First Folio&quot; in 1623. As such, with what little available solid evidence suggesting that Shakespeare did indeed write the play, questions of authorship tend to focus on the perceived lack of quality in the writing, and often the play&#x27;s resemblance to the work of contemporaneous dramatists.

The first to question Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship is thought to have been Edward Ravenscroft in 1678, and over the course of the eighteenth century, numerous renowned Shakespeareans followed suit; Nicholas Rowe, Alexander Pope, Lewis Theobald, Samuel Johnson, George Steevens, Edmond Malone, William Guthrie, John Upton, Benjamin Heath, Richard Farmer, John Pinkerton, and John Monck Mason, and in the nineteenth century, William Hazlitt and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. All doubted Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship. So strong had the anti-Shakespearean movement become during the eighteenth century that in 1794, Thomas Percy wrote in the introduction to &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s memory has been fully vindicated from the charge of writing the play by the best critics.&quot; Similarly, in 1832, the &quot;Globe Illustrated Shakespeare&quot; claimed there was universal agreement on the matter due to the un-Shakespearean &quot;barbarity&quot; of the play.

However, despite the fact that so many Shakespearean scholars believed the play to have been written by someone other than Shakespeare, there were those throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century who argued against this theory. One such scholar was Edward Capell, who, in 1768, said that the play was badly written but asserted that Shakespeare did write it. Another major scholar to support Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship was Charles Knight in 1843. Several years later, a number of prominent German Shakespeareans also voiced their belief that Shakespeare wrote the play, including August Wilhelm Schlegel and Hermann Ulrici.

Twentieth century criticism moved away from trying to prove or disprove that Shakespeare wrote the play, and instead came to focus on the issue of co-authorship. Ravenscroft had hinted at this in 1678, but the first modern scholar to look at the theory was John Mackinnon Robertson in 1905, who concluded that &quot;much of the play is written by George Peele, and it is hardly less certain that much of the rest was written by Robert Greene or Kyd, with some by Marlow&quot;. In 1919, T. M. Parrott reached the conclusion that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, and in 1931, Philip Timberlake corroborated Parrott&#x27;s findings.
The first major critic to challenge Robertson, Parrott and Timberlake was E. K. Chambers, who successfully exposed inherent flaws in Robertson&#x27;s methodology. In 1933, Arthur M. Sampley employed the techniques of Parrott to argue &quot;against&quot; Peele as co-author, and in 1943, Hereward Thimbleby Price also argued that Shakespeare wrote alone.

Beginning in 1948, with John Dover Wilson, many scholars have tended to favour the theory that Shakespeare and Peele collaborated in some way. Dover Wilson, for his part, believed that Shakespeare edited a play originally written by Peele. In 1957, R. F. Hill approached the issue by analysing the distribution of rhetorical devices in the play. Like Parrott in 1919 and Timberlake in 1931, he ultimately concluded that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, while Shakespeare wrote everything else. In 1979, Macdonald Jackson employed a rare word test, and ultimately came to an identical conclusion as Parrott, Timberlake and Hill. In 1987, Marina Tarlinskaja used a quantitative analysis of the occurrence of stresses in the iambic pentameter line, and she too concluded that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1. In 1996, Macdonald Jackson returned to the authorship question with a new metrical analysis of the function words &quot;and&quot; and &quot;with&quot;. His findings also suggested that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1.

However, there have always been scholars who believe that Shakespeare worked on the play alone. Many of the editors of the various twentieth century scholarly editions of the play for example, have argued against the co-authorship theory; Eugene M. Waith in his &quot;Oxford Shakespeare&quot; edition of 1985, Alan Hughes in his &quot;Cambridge Shakespeare&quot; edition of 1994 and again in 2006, and Jonathan Bate in his &quot;Arden Shakespeare&quot; edition of 1995. In the case of Bate however, in 2002, he came out in support of Brian Vickers&#x27; book &quot;Shakespeare, Co-Author&quot; which restates the case for Peele as the author of Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1.

As well as analysing the distribution of a large number of rhetorical devices throughout the play, Vickers also devised three new authorship tests; an analysis of polysyllabic words, an analysis of the distribution of alliteration and an analysis of vocatives. His findings led him to assert that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1. Vickers&#x27; findings have not been universally accepted. Subsequent investigation by the &quot;New Oxford Shakespeare&quot; published in the edition&#x27;s &quot;Authorship Companion&quot; found that scene 4.1 is in fact by Shakespeare not Peele and that the Fly Scene (3.2), present only in 1623 Folio edition, is a late addition to the play, probably made by Thomas Middleton after Shakespeare died in 1616. These findings are disputed by Darren Freebury-Jones in &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Borrowed Feathers&quot;, who provides fresh evidence for Peele&#x27;s authorship of 4.1 and argues that the Fly Scene, though absent from earlier editions, probably formed part of the original play but was omitted when Shakespeare and Peele&#x27;s scenes were merged.

===Language===

The language of &quot;Titus&quot; has always had a central role in criticism of the play insofar as those who doubt Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship have often pointed to the apparent deficiencies in the language as evidence of that claim. However, the quality of the language has had its defenders over the years, critics who argue that the play is more linguistically complex than is often thought, and features a more accomplished use of certain linguistic motifs than has hitherto been allowed for.

One of the most basic such motifs is repetition. Several words and topics occur time and again, serving to connect and contrast characters and scenes, and to foreground certain themes. Perhaps the most obvious recurring motifs are those of honour, virtue and nobility, all of which are mentioned multiple times throughout the play, especially during the first act; the play&#x27;s opening line is Saturninus&#x27; address to &quot;Noble patricians, patrons of my right&quot; (l.1). In the second speech of the play, Bassianus states &quot;And suffer not dishonour to approach/The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,/To justice, continence and nobility;/But let desert in pure election shine&quot; (ll.13–16). From this point onwards, the concept of nobility is at the heart of everything that happens. H. B. Charlton argues of this opening Act that &quot;the standard of moral currency most in use is honour&quot;.

When Marcus announces Titus&#x27; imminent arrival, he emphasises Titus&#x27; renowned honour and integrity: &quot;And now at last, laden with honour&#x27;s spoils,/Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,/Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms./Let us entreat by honour of his name/Whom worthily you would have now succeed&quot; (ll.36–40). Marcus&#x27; reference to Titus&#x27; name is even itself an allusion to his nobility insofar as Titus&#x27; full title (Titus Pius) is an honorary epitaph which &quot;refers to his devotion to patriotic duty&quot;.

Bassianus then cites his own admiration for all of the Andronici: &quot;Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy/In thy uprightness and integrity,/And so I love and honour thee and thine,/Thy noble brother Titus, and his sons&quot; (ll.47–50). Upon Titus&#x27; arrival, an announcement is made: &quot;Patron of virtue, Rome&#x27;s best champion,/Successful in the battles that he fights,/With honour and with fortune is returned&quot; (ll.65–68). Once Titus has arrived on stage, it is not long before he too is speaking of honour, virtue and integrity, referring to the family tomb as a &quot;sweet cell of virtue and nobility&quot; (l.93). After Titus chooses Saturninus as Emperor, they praise one another&#x27;s honour, with Saturninus referring to Titus&#x27; &quot;honourable family&quot; (ll.239) and Titus claiming &quot;I hold me highly honoured of your grace&quot; (ll.245). Titus then says to Tamora, &quot;Now, madam, are you prisoner to an Emperor –/To him that for your honour and your state/Will use you nobly and your followers&quot; (ll.258–260).

Even when things begin to go awry for the Andronici, each one maintains a firm grasp of his own interpretation of honour. The death of Mutius comes about because Titus and his sons have different concepts of honour; Titus feels the Emperor&#x27;s desires should have precedence, his sons that Roman law should govern all, including the Emperor. As such, when Lucius reprimands Titus for slaying one of his own sons, Titus responds &quot;Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;/My sons would never so dishonour me&quot; (l.296). Moments later, Saturninus declares to Titus &quot;I&#x27;ll trust by leisure him that mocks me once,/Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,/Confederates all to dishonour me&quot; (ll.301–303). Subsequently, Titus cannot quite believe that Saturninus has chosen Tamora as his empress and again sees himself dishonoured; &quot;Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,/Dishonoured thus and challeng&#x27;d of wrongs&quot; (ll.340–341). When Marcus is pleading with Titus that Mutius should be allowed to be buried in the family tomb, he implores, &quot;Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter/His noble nephew here in virtue&#x27;s nest,/That died in honour and Lavinia&#x27;s cause&quot; (ll.375–377). Having reluctantly agreed to allow Mutius a royal burial, Titus then returns to the issue of how he feels his sons have turned on him and dishonoured him: &quot;The dismall&#x27;st day is this that e&#x27;er I saw,/To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome&quot; (ll.384–385). At this point, Marcus, Martius, Quintus and Lucius declare of the slain Mutius, &quot;He lives in fame, that died in virtue&#x27;s cause&quot; (ll.390).

Other characters also become involved in the affray resulting from the disagreement among the Andronici, and they too are equally concerned with honour. After Saturninus has condemned Titus, Bassianus appeals to him, &quot;This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,/Is in opinion and in honour wronged&quot; (ll.415–416). Then, in a surprising move, Tamora suggests to Saturninus that he should forgive Titus and his family. Saturninus is at first aghast, believing that Tamora is now dishonouring him as well; &quot;What madam, be dishonoured openly,/And basely put it up without revenge?&quot; (ll.442–443), to which Tamora replies,

The irony here, of course, is that her false appeal to honour is what begins the bloody cycle of revenge which dominates the rest of the play.
Although not all subsequent scenes are as heavily saturated with references to honour, nobility and virtue as is the opening, they are continually alluded to throughout the play. Other notable examples include Aaron&#x27;s description of Tamora; &quot;Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,/And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown&quot; (2.1.10–11). An ironic and sarcastic reference to honour occurs when Bassianus and Lavinia encounter Aaron and Tamora in the forest and Bassianus tells Tamora &quot;your swarthy Cimmerian/Doth make your honour of his body&#x27;s hue,/Spotted, detested, and abominable&quot; (2.3.72–74). Later, after the Clown has delivered Titus&#x27; letter to Saturninus, Saturninus declares &quot;Go, drag the villain hither by the hair./Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege&quot; (4.4.55–56). Another example is seen outside Rome, when a Goth refers to Lucius &quot;Whose high exploits and honourable deeds/Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt&quot; (5.1.11–12).

A further significant motif is metaphor related to violence: &quot;the world of &quot;Titus&quot; is not simply one of meaningless acts of random violence but rather one in which language engenders violence and violence is done to language through the distance between word and thing, between metaphor and what it represents.&quot; For example, in 3.1 when Titus asks Aaron to cut off his hand because he believes it will save his sons&#x27; lives he says, &quot;Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.&quot; Therefore, in the language of &quot;Titus&quot;, &quot;to lend one&#x27;s hand is to risk dismemberment.&quot;

No discussion of the language of &quot;Titus&quot; is complete without reference to Marcus&#x27;s speech upon finding Lavinia after her rape:


In this much discussed speech, the discrepancy between the beautiful imagery and the horrific sight before us has been noted by many critics as jarring, and the speech is often severely edited or completely removed for performance; in the 1955 RSC production, for example, director Peter Brook cut the speech entirely. There is also a great deal of disagreement amongst critics as to the essential meaning of the speech. John Dover Wilson, for example, sees it as nothing more than a parody, Shakespeare mocking the work of his contemporaries by writing something so bad. He finds no other tonally analogous speech in all of Shakespeare, concluding it is &quot;a bundle of ill-matched conceits held together by sticky sentimentalism&quot;. Similarly, Eugene M. Waith determines that the speech is an aesthetic failure that may have looked good on the page but which is incongruous in performance.

However, defenders of the play have posited several theories which seek to illustrate the thematic relevance of the speech. For example, Nicholas Brooke argues that it &quot;stands in the place of a choric commentary on the crime, establishing its significance to the play by making an emblem of the mutilated woman&quot;. Actress Eve Myles, who played Lavinia in the 2003 RSC production, suggests that Marcus &quot;tries to bandage her wounds with language&quot;, thus the speech has a calming effect and is Marcus&#x27;s attempt to soothe Lavinia.

Another theory is suggested by Anthony Brian Taylor, who argues simply that Marcus is babbling; &quot;beginning with references to &#x27;dream&#x27; and &#x27;slumber&#x27; and ending with one to sleep, the speech is an old man&#x27;s reverie; shaken by the horrible and totally unexpected spectacle before him, he has succumbed to the senile tendency to drift away and become absorbed in his own thoughts rather than confront the harshness of reality.&quot; Jonathan Bate however, sees the speech as more complex, arguing that it attempts to give voice to the indescribable. Bate thus sees it as an illustration of language&#x27;s ability to &quot;bring back that which has been lost&quot;, i.e. Lavinia&#x27;s beauty and innocence is figuratively returned in the beauty of the language. Similarly, for Brian Vickers, &quot;these sensual pictorial images are appropriate to Lavinia&#x27;s beauty now forever destroyed. That is, they serve one of the constant functions of tragedy, to document the &quot;metabolé&quot;, that tragic contrast between what people once were and what they have become.&quot; Jacques Berthoud provides another theory, arguing that the speech &quot;exhibits two qualities seldom found together: an unevasive emotional recognition of the horrors of her injuries, and the knowledge that, despite her transformation into a living grave of herself, she remains the person he knows and loves.&quot; Thus, the speech evokes Marcus&#x27;s &quot;protective identification&quot; with her. D. J. Palmer feels that the speech is an attempt to rationalise in Marcus&#x27;s own mind the sheer horror of what he is seeing;

In contradistinction to Dover Wilson and Waith, several scholars have argued that while the speech may not work on the page, it can work in performance. Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter&#x27;s delivery of the speech &quot;became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We had the sense of a suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken no more than a second or two to flash through the character&#x27;s mind, like a bad dream.&quot; Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter&#x27;s performance, Alan C. Dessen writes &quot;we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia&#x27;s reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly &quot;and&quot; see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience.&quot;
Looking at the language of the play in a more general sense has also produced a range of critical theories. For example, Jacques Berthoud argues that the rhetoric of the play is explicitly bound up with its theme; &quot;the entire dramatic script, soliloquies included, functions as a network of responses and reactions. [The language&#x27;s] primary and consistent function is interlocutory.&quot; An entirely different interpretation is that of Jack Reese, who argues that Shakespeare&#x27;s use of language functions to remove the audience from the effects and implications of violence; it has an almost Brechtian . Using the example of Marcus&#x27; speech, Reese argues that the audience is disconnected from the violence through the seemingly incongruent descriptions of that violence. Such language serves to &quot;further emphasise the artificiality of the play; in a sense, they suggest to the audience that it is hearing a poem read rather than seeing the events of that poem put into dramatic form.&quot; Gillian Kendall, however, reaches the opposite conclusion, arguing that rhetorical devices such as metaphor augment the violent imagery, not diminish it, because the figurative use of certain words complements their literal counterparts. This, however, &quot;disrupts the way the audience perceives imagery.&quot; An example of this is seen in the body politic/dead body imagery early in the play, as the two images soon become interchangeable. Another theory is provided by Peter M. Sacks, who argues that the language of the play is marked by &quot;an artificial and heavily emblematic style, and above all a revoltingly grotesque series of horrors which seem to have little function but to ironise man&#x27;s inadequate expressions of pain and loss&quot;.

===Themes===
==Performance==
The earliest definite recorded performance of &quot;Titus&quot; was on 24 January 1594, when Philip Henslowe noted a performance by Sussex&#x27;s Men of &quot;Titus &amp; ondronicus&quot;. Although Henslowe does not specify a theatre, it was most likely The Rose. Repeated performances were staged on 28 January and 6 February. On 5 and 12 June, Henslowe recorded two further performances of the play, at the Newington Butts Theatre by the combined Admiral&#x27;s Men and Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. The 24 January show earned three pounds eight shillings, and the performances on 29 January and 6 February earned two pounds each, making it the most profitable play of the season. The next recorded performance was on 1 January 1596, when a troupe of London actors, possibly Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, performed the play during the Christmas festivities at Burley-on-the-Hill in the manor of Sir John Harington, Baron of Exton.

Some scholars, however, have suggested that the January 1594 performance may not be the first recorded performance of the play. On 11 April 1592, Henslowe recorded ten performances by Derby&#x27;s Men of a play called &quot;Titus and Vespasian&quot;, which some, such as E. K. Chambers, have identified with Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Most scholars, however, believe that &quot;Titus and Vespasian&quot; is more likely a different play about the two real life Roman Emperors, Vespasian, who ruled from 69 to 79, and his son Titus, who ruled from 79 to 81. The two were subjects of many narratives at the time, and a play about them would not have been unusual. Dover Wilson further argues that the theory that &quot;Titus and Vespasian&quot; is &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; probably originated in an 1865 English translation of a 1620 German translation of &quot;Titus&quot;, in which Lucius had been renamed Vespasian.
Although it is known that the play was definitely popular in its day, there is no other recorded performance for many years. In January 1668, it was listed by the Lord Chamberlain as one of twenty-one plays owned by the King&#x27;s Company which had, at some stage previously, been acted at Blackfriars Theatre; &quot;A Catalogue of part of his Mates Servants Playes as they were formally acted at the Blackfryers &amp; now allowed of to his Mates Servants at ye New Theatre.&quot; However, no other information is provided. During the late seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, adaptations of the play came to dominate the stage, and after the Burley performance in 1596 and the possible Blackfriars performance some time prior to 1667, there is no definite recorded performance of the Shakespearean text in England until the early twentieth century.

After over 300 years absence from the English stage, the play returned on 8 October 1923, in a production directed by Robert Atkins at The Old Vic, as part of the Vic&#x27;s presentation of the complete dramatic works over a seven-year period. The production featured Wilfred Walter as Titus, Florence Saunders as Tamora, George Hayes as Aaron and Jane Bacon as Lavinia. Reviews at the time praised Hayes&#x27; performance but criticised Walter&#x27;s as monotonous. Atkins staged the play with a strong sense of Elizabethan theatrical authenticity, with a plain black backdrop, and a minimum of props. Critically, the production met with mixed reviews, some welcoming the return of the original play to the stage, some questioning why Atkins had bothered when various adaptations were much better and still extant. Nevertheless, the play was a huge box office success, one of the most successful in the Complete Works presentation.

The earliest known performance of the Shakespearean text in the United States was in April 1924 when the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity of Yale University staged the play under the direction of John M. Berdan and E. M. Woolley as part of a double bill with Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay&quot;. While some material was removed from 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, the rest of the play was left intact, with much attention devoted to the violence and gore. The cast list for this production has been lost.

The best known and most successful production of the play in England was directed by Peter Brook for the RSC at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1955, starring Laurence Olivier as Titus, Maxine Audley as Tamora, Anthony Quayle as Aaron and Vivien Leigh as Lavinia. Brook had been offered the chance to direct &quot;Macbeth&quot; but had controversially turned it down, and instead decided to stage &quot;Titus&quot;. The media predicted that the production would be a massive failure, and possibly spell the end of Brook&#x27;s career, but on the contrary, it was a huge commercial and critical success, with many of the reviews arguing that Brook&#x27;s alterations improved Shakespeare&#x27;s script (Marcus&#x27; lengthy speech upon discovering Lavinia was removed and some of the scenes in Act 4 were reorganised). Olivier in particular was singled out for his performance and for making Titus a truly sympathetic character. J. C. Trewin for example, wrote &quot;the actor had thought himself into the hell of Titus; we forgot the inadequacy of the words in the spell of the projection.&quot; The production is also noted for muting the violence: Chiron and Demetrius were killed off stage; the heads of Quintus and Martius were never seen; the nurse is strangled, not stabbed; Titus&#x27; hand was never seen; blood and wounds were symbolised by red ribbons. Edward Trostle Jones summed up the style of the production as employing &quot;stylised distancing effects&quot;. The scene where Lavinia first appears after the rape was singled out by critics as being especially horrific, with her wounds portrayed by red streamers hanging from her wrists and mouth. Some reviewers however, found the production too beautified, making it unrealistic, with several commenting on the cleanness of Lavinia&#x27;s face after her tongue has supposedly been cut out. After its hugely successful Royal Shakespeare Theatre run, the play went on tour around Europe in 1957. No video recordings of the production are known, although there are many photographs available.

The success of the Brook production seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, and ever since 1955, there has been a steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale&#x27;s production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of &quot;Titus&quot;, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths at the end of the play were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at the end of the play swastikas rained down onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.

Later in 1967, as a direct reaction to Seale&#x27;s realistic production, Gerald Freedman directed a performance for Joseph Papp&#x27;s Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, Manhattan, starring Jack Hollander as Titus, Olympia Dukakis as Tamora, Moses Gunn as Aaron and Erin Martin as Lavinia. Freedman had seen Seale&#x27;s production and felt it failed because it worked by &quot;bringing into play our sense of reality in terms of detail and literal time structure&quot;. He argued that when presented realistically, the play simply does not work, as it raises too many practical questions, such as why does Lavinia not bleed to death, why does Marcus not take her to the hospital immediately, why does Tamora not notice that the pie tastes unusual, exactly how do both Martius and Quintus manage to fall into a hole? Freedman argued that &quot;if one wants to create a fresh emotional response to the violence, blood and multiple mutilations of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, one must shock the imagination and subconscious with visual images that recall the richness and depth of primitive rituals.&quot; As such, the costumes were purposely designed to represent no particular time or place but were instead based on those of the Byzantine Empire and feudal Japan. Additionally, the violence was stylised; instead of swords and daggers, wands were used and no contact was ever made. The colour scheme was hallucinatory, changing mid-scene. Characters wore classic masks of comedy and tragedy. The slaughter in the final scene was accomplished symbolically by having each character wrapped in a red robe as they died. A narrator (Charles Dance) was also used, who, prior to each act, would announce what was going to happen in the upcoming act, thus undercutting any sense of realism. The production received generally positive reviews, with Mildred Kuner arguing &quot;Symbolism rather than gory realism was what made this production so stunning.&quot;

In 1972, Trevor Nunn directed an RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, as part of a presentation of the four Roman plays, starring Colin Blakely as Titus, Margaret Tyzack as Tamora, Calvin Lockhart as Aaron and Janet Suzman as Lavinia. Colin Blakely and John Wood as a vicious and maniacal Saturninus received particularly positive reviews. This production took the realistic approach and did not shirk from the more specific aspects of the violence; for example, Lavinia has trouble walking after the rape, which, it is implied, was anal rape. Nunn believed the play asked profound questions about the sustainability of Elizabethan society, and as such, he linked the play to the contemporary period to ask the same questions of late twentieth-century England; he was &quot;less concerned with the condition of ancient Rome than with the morality of contemporary life&quot;. In his program notes, Nunn wrote &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Elizabethan nightmare has become ours.&quot; He was especially interested in the theory that decadence had led to the collapse of Rome. At the end of 4.2, for example, there was an on-stage orgy, and throughout the play, supporting actors appeared in the backgrounds dancing, eating, drinking and behaving outrageously. Also in this vein, the play opened with a group of people paying homage to a waxwork of an obese emperor reclining on a couch and clutching a bunch of grapes.

The play was performed for the first time at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada in 1978, when it was directed by Brian Bedford, starring William Hutt as Titus, Jennifer Phipps as Tamora, Alan Scarfe as Aaron and Domini Blithe as Lavinia. Bedford went with neither stylisation nor realism; instead the violence simply tended to happen off-stage, but everything else was realistically presented. The play received mixed reviews with some praising its restraint and others arguing that the suppression of the violence went too far. Many cited the final scene, where despite three onstage stabbings, not one drop of blood was visible, and the reveal of Lavinia, where she was totally bloodless despite her mutilation. This production cut Lucius&#x27; final speech and instead ended with Aaron alone on the stage as Sibyl predicts the fall of Rome in lines written by Bedford himself. As such, &quot;for affirmation and healing under Lucius the production substituted a sceptical modern theme of evil triumphant and Rome&#x27;s decadence.&quot;

A celebrated, and unedited production, (according to Jonathan Bate, not a single line from Q1 was cut) was directed by Deborah Warner in 1987 at The Swan and remounted at Barbican&#x27;s Pit in 1988 for the RSC, starring Brian Cox as Titus, Estelle Kohler as Tamora, Peter Polycarpou as Aaron and Sonia Ritter as Lavinia. Met with almost universally positive reviews, Jonathan Bate regards it as the finest production of any Shakespearean play of the entire 1980s. Using a small cast, Warner had her actors address the audience from time to time throughout the play and often had actors leave the stage and wander out into the auditorium. Opting for a realist presentation, the play had a warning posted in the pit &quot;This play contains scenes which some people may find disturbing&quot;, and numerous critics noted how, after the interval at many shows, empty seats had appeared in the audience. Warner&#x27;s production was considered so successful, both critically and commercially, that the RSC did not stage the play again until 2003.

In 1988, Mark Rucker directed a realistic production at Shakespeare Santa Cruz, starring J. Kenneth Campbell as Titus, Molly Maycock as Tamora, Elizabeth Atkeson as Lavinia, and an especially well-received performance by Bruce A. Young as Aaron. Campbell presented Titus in a much more sympathetic light than usual; for example, he kills Mutius by accident, pushing him so that he falls against a tree, and his refusal to allow Mutius to be buried was performed as if in a dream state. Prior to the production, Rucker had Young work out and get in shape so that by the time of the performance, he weighed 240 lbs. Standing at six-foot four, his Aaron was purposely designed to be the most physically imposing character on the stage. Additionally, he was often positioned as standing on hills and tables, with the rest of the cast below him. When he appears with the Goths, he is not their prisoner, but willingly enters their camp in pursuit of his baby, the implication being that without this one weakness, he would have been invincible.

In 1994, Julie Taymor directed the play at the Theater for the New City. The production featured a prologue and epilogue set in the modern era, foregrounded the character of Young Lucius, who acts as a kind of choric observer of events, and starred Robert Stattel as Titus, Melinda Mullins as Tamora, Harry Lennix as Aaron and Miriam Healy-Louie as Lavinia. Heavily inspired in her design by Joel-Peter Witkin, Taymor used stone columns to represent the people of Rome, who she saw as silent and incapable of expressing any individuality or subjectivity. Controversially, the play ended with the implication that Lucius had killed Aaron&#x27;s baby, despite his vow not to.

In 1995, Gregory Doran directed a production at the Royal National Theatre, which also played at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa, starring Antony Sher as Titus, Dorothy Ann Gould as Tamora, Sello Maake as Aaron and Jennifer Woodbine as Lavinia. Although Doran explicitly denied any political overtones, the play was set in a modern African context and made explicit parallels to South African politics. In his production notes, which Doran co-wrote with Sher, he stated, &quot;Surely, to be relevant, theatre must have an umbilical connection to the lives of the people watching it.&quot; One particularly controversial decision was to have the play spoken in indigenous accents rather than Received Pronunciation, which allegedly resulted in many white South Africans refusing to see the play. Writing in &quot;Plays International&quot; in August 1995, Robert Lloyd Parry argued &quot;the questions raised by &quot;Titus&quot; went far beyond the play itself [to] many of the tensions that exist in the new South Africa; the gulf of mistrust that still exists between blacks and whites ... &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; has proved itself to be political theatre in the truest sense.&quot;

For the first time since 1987, the RSC staged the play in 2003, under the direction of Bill Alexander and starring David Bradley as Titus, Maureen Beattie as Tamora, Joe Dixon as Aron and Eve Myles as Lavinia. Convinced that Act 1 was by George Peele, Alexander felt he was not undermining the integrity of Shakespeare by drastically altering it; for example, Saturninus and Tamora are present throughout, they never leave the stage; there is no division between the upper and lower levels; all mention of Mutius is absent; and over 100 lines were removed.
In 2006, two major productions were staged within a few weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to toe in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey&#x27;s use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia&#x27;s appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed for the first time in its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium – a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium.
The second 2006 production opened at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 9 June as part of the &quot;Complete Works Festival&quot;. Directed by Yukio Ninagawa, it starred Kotaro Yoshida as Titus, Rei Asami as Tamora, Shun Oguri as Aaron and Hitomi Manaka as Lavinia. Performed in Japanese, the original English text was projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. In stark contrast to Bailey&#x27;s production, theatricality was emphasised; the play begins with the company still rehearsing and getting into costume and the stage hands still putting the sets together. The production followed the 1955 Brook production in its depiction of violence; actress Hitomi Manaka appeared after the rape scene with stylised red ribbons coming from her mouth and arms, substituting for blood. Throughout the play, at the back of the stage, a huge marble wolf can be seen from which feed Romulus and Remus, with the implication being that Rome is a society based on animalistic origins. The play ends with Young Lucius holding Aaron&#x27;s baby out to the audience and crying out &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot;

Several reviews of the time made much of the manner in which each production approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape: &quot;At Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey&#x27;s coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry.&quot; Speaking of Bailey&#x27;s production, Eleanor Collins of , said of the scene, &quot;audience members turned their heads away in real distress&quot;. Charles Spencer of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called Lavinia &quot;almost too ghastly to behold&quot;. Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said her slow shuffle onto the stage &quot;chills the blood&quot;. Sam Marlowe of &quot;The Times&quot; saw Bailey&#x27;s use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole: &quot;violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It&#x27;s the production&#x27;s most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war.&quot; Of Ninagawa&#x27;s production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of &quot;The Times&quot;, for example, asked &quot;is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?&quot; Similarly, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey&#x27;s use of realistic effects, wrote &quot;At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence.&quot; Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey&#x27;s realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of , for example, wrote &quot;Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia&#x27;s mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic.&quot; Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, wrote &quot;Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror.&quot; Ninagawa himself said &quot;The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production.&quot; In her 2013 essay, &quot;Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;&quot;, which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agnès Lafont writes of Ninagawa&#x27;s production that Lavinia&#x27;s appearance functions as a &quot;visual emblem&quot;: &quot;Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance ... Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to &#x27;dissonance&#x27;, the production presents Lavinia onstage as if she were a painting ... Ninagawa&#x27;s work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood ... are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it.&quot;

In 2007, Gale Edwards directed a production for the Shakespeare Theatre Company at the Harman Center for the Arts, starring Sam Tsoutsouvas as Titus, Valerie Leonard as Tamora, Colleen Delany as Lavinia, and Peter Macon as Aaron. Set in an unspecific modern milieu, props were kept to a minimum, with lighting and general staging kept simple, as Edwards wanted the audience to concentrate on the story, not the staging. The production received generally very favourable reviews.

In 2011, Michael Sexton directed a modern military dress production at The Public Theater on a minimalistic set made of plywood boards. The production had a low budget and much of it was spent on huge volumes of blood that literally drenched the actors in the final scene, as Sexton said he was determined to outdo his contemporaries in terms of the amount of on-stage blood in the play. The production starred Jay O. Sanders (who was nominated for a Lucille Lortel) as Titus, Stephanie Roth Haberle as Tamora, Ron Cephas Jones as Aaron and Jennifer Ikeda as Lavinia.

In 2013, Michael Fentiman directed the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Stephen Boxer as Titus, Katy Stephens as Tamora, Kevin Harvey as Aaron, and Rose Reynolds as Lavinia. Emphasising the gore and violence, the production carried a trailer with warnings of &quot;graphic imagery and scenes of butchery&quot;. It played at The Swan until October 2013. Also in 2013, the Hudson Shakespeare Company staged a production directed by Jon Ciccarelli as part of a special Halloween festival for the Historic Jersey City and Harsimus Cemetery. The production contrasted a military and modern Goth culture, but quickly disintegrated into an anarchic state, stressing the black comedy of the play.

Outside Britain and the United States, other significant productions include Qiping Xu&#x27;s 1986 production in China, which drew political parallels to Mao Zedong&#x27;s Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards; Peter Stein&#x27;s 1989 production in Italy which evoked images of twentieth century Fascism; Daniel Mesguich&#x27;s 1989 production in Paris, which set the entire play in a crumbling library, acting as a symbol for Roman civilisation; Nenni Delmestre&#x27;s 1992 production in Zagreb which acted as a metaphor for the struggles of the Croatian people; and Silviu Purcărete&#x27;s 1992 Romanian production, which explicitly avoided using the play as a metaphor for the fall of Nicolae Ceaușescu (this production is one of the most successful plays ever staged in Romania, and it was revived every year up to 1997).

==Adaptations==

===Plays===

The first known adaptation of the play originated in the later years of the sixteenth century. In 1620, a German publication entitled contained a play called (&quot;A most lamentable tragedy of Titus Andronicus and the haughty empress, wherein are found memorable events&quot;). Transcribed by Frederick Menius, the play was a version of &quot;Titus&quot; performed by Robert Browne and John Greene&#x27;s group of travelling players. The overriding plot of &quot;Tito Andronico&quot; is identical to &quot;Titus&quot;, but all the character names are different, with the exception of Titus himself. Written in prose, the play does not feature the fly killing scene (3.2), Bassianus does not oppose Saturninus for the throne, Alarbus is absent, Quintus and Mutius are only seen after their death, many of the classical and mythological allusions have been removed; stage directions are much more elaborate, for example, in the banquet scene, Titus is described as wearing blood-soaked rags and carrying a butcher&#x27;s knife dripping with blood.

Another European adaptation came in 1637, when Dutch dramatist Jan Vos wrote a version of the play entitled &quot;Aran en Titus&quot;, which was published in 1641, and republished in 1642, 1644, 1648 and 1649, illustrating its popularity. The play may have been based on a 1621 work, now lost, by Adriaen Van den Bergh, which may itself have been a composite of the English &quot;Titus&quot; and the German &quot;Tito Andronico&quot;. Vos&#x27; play focuses on Aaron, who, in the final scene, is burned alive on stage, beginning a tradition amongst adaptations of foregrounding the Moor and ending the play with his death.
The earliest English language adaptation was in 1678 at Drury Lane, by Edward Ravenscroft: &quot;Titus Andronicus, or the Rape of Lavinia. A Tragedy, Alter&#x27;d from Mr. Shakespeares Works&quot;, probably with Thomas Betterton as Titus and Samuel Sandford as Aaron. In his preface, Ravenscroft wrote &quot;Compare the Old Play with this you&#x27;l finde that none in all that Authors Works ever receiv&#x27;d greater Alterations or Additions, the language not only Refin&#x27;d, but many Scenes entirely New: Besides most of the principal Characters heighten&#x27;d and the Plot much incresas&#x27;d.&quot; The play was a huge success and was revived in 1686, and published the following year. It was revived again in 1704 and 1717. The 1717 revival was especially successful, starring John Mills as Titus, Mrs. Giffard as Tamora, James Quin as Aaron, and John Thurmond as Saturninus. The play was revived again in 1718 and 1719 (with John Bickerstaff as Aaron) and 1721 (with Thomas Walker in the role). Quin had left Drury Lane in 1718 and gone to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, which was owned by John Rich. Rich&#x27;s actors had little Shakespearean experience, and Quin was soon advertised as the main attraction. In 1718, the adaptation was presented twice at Lincoln, both times with Quin as Aaron. In the 1720–1721 season, the play earned £81 with three performances. Quin became synonymous with the role of Aaron, and in 1724 he chose the adaptation as the play to be performed at his benefit.

Ravenscroft made drastic alterations to the play. He removed all of 2.2 (preparing for the hunt), 3.2 (the fly killing scene), 4.3 (firing the arrows and sending the clown to Saturninus) and 4.4 (the execution of the clown). Much of the violence was toned down; for example both the murder of Chiron and Demetrius and Titus&#x27; amputation take place off stage. A significant change in the first scene, and one with major implications for the rest of the play, is that prior to the sacrifice of Alarbus, it is revealed that several years previously, Tamora had one of Titus&#x27; sons in captivity and refused to show him clemency despite Titus&#x27; pleas. Aaron has a much larger role in Ravenscroft than in Shakespeare, especially in Act 1, where lines originally assigned to Demetrius and Tamora are given to him. Tamora does not give birth during the action, but earlier, with the baby secretly kept by a nurse. To maintain the secret, Aaron kills the nurse, and it is the nurse&#x27;s husband, not Lucius, who captures Aaron as he leaves Rome with the child. Additionally, Lucius&#x27; army is not composed of Goths, but of Roman centurions loyal to the Andronici. The last act is also considerably longer; Tamora and Saturninus both have lengthy speeches after their fatal stabbings. Tamora asks for her child to be brought to her, but she stabs it immediately upon receiving it. Aaron laments that Tamora has now outdone him in evil; &quot;She has out-done me in my own Art –/Out-done me in Murder – Kille&#x27;d her own Child./Give it me – I&#x27;le eat it.&quot; He is burned alive as the climax of the play.

In January and February 1839 an adaptation written and directed by and also starring Nathaniel Bannister was performed for four nights at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. The playbill had a note reading &quot;The manager, in announcing this play, adapted by N. H. Bannister from the language of Shakespeare alone, assures the public that every expression calculated to offend the ear, has been studiously avoided, and the play is presented for their decision with full confidence that it will merit approbation.&quot; In his &quot;History of the Philadelphia Stage&quot;, Volume IV (1878), Charles Durang wrote, &quot;Bannister ably preserved the beauties of its poetry, the intensity of its incidents, and excluded the horrors with infinite skill, yet preserved all the interest of the drama.&quot; Nothing else is known about this production.
The most successful adaptation of the play in Britain premiered in 1850, written by Ira Aldridge and C. A. Somerset. Aaron was rewritten to make him the hero of the piece (played by Aldridge), the rape and mutilation of Lavinia were removed, Tamora (Queen of Scythia) became chaste and honourable, with Aaron as her friend only, and Chiron and Demetrius act only out of love for their mother. Only Saturninus is a truly evil character. Towards the end of the play, Saturninus has Aaron chained to a tree, and his baby flung into the Tiber. Aaron frees himself however and leaps into the river after the child. At the end, Saturninus poisons Aaron, but as Aaron dies, Lavinia promises to look after his child for him, due to his saving her from rape earlier in the piece. An entire scene from &quot;Zaraffa, the Slave King&quot;, a play written specifically for Aldridge in Dublin in 1847, was included in this adaptation. After the initial performances, Aldridge kept the play in the repertoire, and it was extremely successful at the box office and continued to be staged in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales until at least 1857, when it received a glowing review from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; on 26 April. It was generally agreed amongst reviewers of the period that the Aldridge/Somerset rewrite was considerably superior to Shakespeare&#x27;s original. For example, &quot;The Era&quot; reviewer wrote,

The next adaptation was in 1951, when Kenneth Tynan and Peter Myers staged a thirty-five-minute version entitled &quot;Andronicus&quot; as part of a Grand Guignol presentation at the Irving Theatre. Produced in the tradition of Theatre of Cruelty, the production edited together all of the violent scenes, emphasised the gore, and removed Aaron entirely. In a review in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; on 11 November, Harold Hobson wrote the stage was full of &quot;practically the whole company waving gory stumps and eating cannibal pies&quot;.

In 1957 the Old Vic staged a heavily edited ninety-minute performance as part of a double bill with an edited version of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;. Directed by Walter Hudd, both plays were performed by the same company of actors, with Derek Godfrey as Titus, Barbara Jefford as Tamora, Margaret Whiting as Lavinia and Robert Helpmann as Saturninus. Performed in the manner of a traditional Elizabethan production, the play received mixed reviews. &quot;The Times&quot;, for example, felt that the juxtaposition of the blood tragedy and the frothy comedy was &quot;ill-conceived&quot;.

In 1970, Swiss dramatist Friedrich Dürrenmatt adapted the play into a German language comedy entitled (&quot;Titus Andronicus: Comedy After Shakespeare&quot;). Of the adaptation he wrote &quot;it represents an attempt to render Shakespeare&#x27;s early chaotic work fit for the German stage without having the Shakespearean atrocities and grotesqueries passed over in silence.&quot; Working from a translation of the &quot;First Folio&quot; text by Wolf Graf von Baudissin, Dürrenmatt altered much of the dialogue and changed elements of the plot; the fly killing scene (3.2) and the interrogation of Aaron (5.1) were removed; Titus has Aaron cut off his hand, and after he realises he has been tricked, Marcus brings Lavinia to him rather than the other way around as in the original play. Another major change is that after Aaron is presented with his love child, he flees Rome immediately, and successfully, and is never heard from again. Dürrenmatt also added a new scene, where Lucius arrives at the Goth camp and persuades their leader, Alarich, to help him. At the end of the play, after Lucius has stabbed Saturninus, but before he has given his final speech, Alarich betrays him, kills him, and orders his army to destroy Rome and kill everyone in it.

In 1981, John Barton followed the 1957 Old Vic model and directed a heavily edited version of the play as a double bill with &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; for the RSC, starring Patrick Stewart as Titus, Sheila Hancock as Tamora, Hugh Quarshie as Aaron and Leonie Mellinger as Lavinia. Theatricality and falseness were emphasised, and when actors were off stage, they could be seen at the sides of the stage watching the performance. The production received lukewarm reviews, and had an average box office.

In 1984, German playwright Heiner Müller adapted the play into (&quot;Anatomy Titus: Fall of Rome. A Shakespearean Commentary&quot;). Interspersing the dialogue with a chorus like commentary, the adaptation was heavily political and made reference to numerous twentieth century events, such as the rise of the Third Reich, Stalinism, the erection of the Berlin Wall and the attendant emigration and defection issues, and the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état. Müller removed the entire first act, replacing it was a narrated introduction, and completely rewrote the final act. He described the work as &quot;terrorist in nature&quot;, and foregrounded the violence; for example Lavinia is brutally raped on stage and Aaron takes several hacks at Titus&#x27; hand before amputating it. First performed at the Schauspielhaus Bochum, it was directed by Manfred Karge and Matthias Langhoff, and is still regularly revived in Germany.

In 1989, Jeanette Lambermont directed a heavily edited kabuki version of the play at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, in a double bill with &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, starring Nicholas Pennell as Titus, Goldie Semple as Tamora, Hubert Baron Kelly as Aaron and Lucy Peacock as Lavinia.

In 2005, German playwright Botho Strauß adapted the play into (&quot;Rape: After Titus Andronicus by Shakespeare&quot;), also commonly known by its French name, . Set in both a contemporary and an ancient world predating the Roman Empire, the adaptation begins with a group of salesmen trying to sell real estate; gated communities which they proclaim as , where women and children are secure from &quot;theft, rape and kidnapping&quot;. Mythology is important in the adaptation; Venus is represented as governing nature, but is losing her power to the melancholic and uninterested Saturn, leading to a society rampant with (lack of meaning, insignificance). Written in prose rather than blank verse, changes to the text include the rape of Lavinia being Tamora&#x27;s idea instead of Aaron&#x27;s; the removal of Marcus; Titus does not kill his son; he does not have his hand amputated; Chiron is much more subservient to Demetrius; Aaron is more philosophical, trying to find meaning in his acts of evil rather than simply revelling in them; Titus does not die at the end, nor does Tamora, although the play ends with Titus ordering the deaths of Tamora and Aaron.

In 2008, Müller&#x27;s &quot;Anatomie Titus&quot; was translated into English by Julian Hammond and performed at the Cremorne Theatre in Brisbane, the Canberra Theatre, the Playhouse in the Sydney Opera House and the Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne by the Bell Shakespeare Company and the Queensland Theatre Company. Directed by Michael Gow and with an all-male cast, it starred John Bell as Titus, Peter Cook as Tamora, Timothy Walter as Aaron and Thomas Campbell as Lavinia. Racism was a major theme in this production, with Aaron initially wearing a gorilla mask, and then poorly applied blackface, and his baby &#x27;played&#x27; by a golliwogg.

In 2012, as part of the Globe to Globe Festival at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, the play was performed under the title &quot;Titus 2.0&quot;. Directed by Tang Shu-wing, it starred Andy Ng Wai-shek as Titus, Ivy Pang Ngan-ling as Tamora, Chu Pak-hong as Aaron and Lai Yuk-ching as Lavinia. Performed entirely in Cantonese, from an original script by Cancer Chong, the play had originally been staged in Hong Kong in 2009. The production took a minimalist approach and featured very little blood (after Lavinia has her hands cut off, for example, she simply wears red gloves for the rest of the play). The production features a narrator throughout, who speaks both in first person and third person, sometimes directly to the audience, sometimes to other characters on the stage. The role of the narrator alternates throughout the play, but is always performed by a member of the main cast. The production received excellent reviews, both in its original Hong Kong incarnation, and when restaged at the Globe.

In 2014, Noelle Fair and Lisa LaGrande adapted the play into &quot;Interpreting her Martyr&#x27;d Signs&quot;, the title of which is taken from Titus&#x27; claim to be able to understand the mute Lavinia. Focusing on the backstories of Tamora and Lavinia, the play is set in Purgatory shortly after their deaths, where they find themselves in a waiting area with Aaron as their salvation or damnation is decided upon. As they try to come to terms with their unresolved conflict, Aaron serves as a master of ceremonies, initiating a dialogue between them, leading to a series of flashbacks to their lives prior to the beginning of the play.

&quot;&quot;, an absurdist comic play by Taylor Mac and directed by George C. Wolfe, began previews at the Booth Theatre on Broadway on 11 March 2019 with an opening of 21 April 2019. The cast included Nathan Lane, Kristine Nielsen, and Julie White and involved servants tasked with cleaning up the carnage from the original play.

===Musicals===
&quot;Titus Andronicus: The Musical!&quot;, written by Brian Colonna, Erik Edborg, Hannah Duggan, Erin Rollman, Evan Weissman, Matt Petraglia, and Samantha Schmitz, was staged by the Buntport Theater Company in Denver, Colorado four times between 2002 and 2007. Staged as a band of travelling thespian players who are attempting to put on a serious production of &quot;Titus&quot;, and starring Brian Colonna as Titus, Erin Rollman as Tamora (and Marcus), Hannah Duggan as both Aaron and Lavinia (when playing Aaron she wore a fake moustache), Erik Edborg as Lucius and Saturninus, and Evan Weissman as Someone Who Will Probably Die (he is killed over thirty times during the play). The piece was very much a farce, and included such moments as Lavinia singing an aria to the tune of &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; by Britney Spears, after her tongue has been cut out; Saturninus and Lucius engaged in a sword fight, but both being played by the same actor; Chiron and Demetrius &#x27;played&#x27; by a gas can and a car radio respectively; the love child being born with a black moustache. A number of critics felt that the play improved on Shakespeare&#x27;s original, and several wondered what Harold Bloom would have made of it.

&quot;Tragedy! A Musical Comedy&quot;, written by Michael Johnson and Mary Davenport was performed at the 2007 New York International Fringe Festival in the Lucille Lortel Theatre. Directed by Johnson, the piece starred Francis Van Wetering as Titus, Alexandra Cirves as Tamora, Roger Casey as Aaron (aka The Evil Black Guy) and Lauren Huyett as Lavinia. Staged as a farce, the production included moments such as Lavinia singing a song entitled &quot;At least I can still sing&quot; after having her hands cut off, but as she reaches the finale, Chiron and Demetrius return and cut out her tongue; Lucius is portrayed as a homosexual in love with Saturninus, and everyone knows except Titus; Titus kills Mutius not because he defies him, but because he discovers that Mutius wants to be a tap dancer instead of a soldier; Bassianus is a transvestite; Saturninus is addicted to prescription medication; and Tamora is a nymphomaniac.

===Film===
In 1969, Robert Hartford-Davis planned to make a feature film starring Christopher Lee as Titus and Lesley-Anne Down as Lavinia, but the project never materialised.

The 1973 horror comedy film &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;, directed by Douglas Hickox featured a very loose adaptation of the play. Vincent Price stars in the film as Edward Lionheart, who regards himself as the finest Shakespearean actor of all time. When he fails to be awarded the prestigious Critic&#x27;s Circle Award for Best Actor, he sets about exacting bloody revenge on the critics who gave him poor reviews, with each act inspired by a death in a Shakespeare play. One such act of revenge involves the critic Meredith Merridew (played by Robert Morley). Lionheart abducts Merridew&#x27;s prized poodles, and bakes them in a pie, which he then feeds to Merridew, before revealing all and force-feeding the critic until he chokes to death.

A 1997 straight-to-video adaptation, which cuts back on the violence, titled &quot;Titus Andronicus: The Movie&quot;, was directed by Lorn Richey and starred Ross Dippel as Titus, Aldrich Allen as Aaron, and Maureen Moran as Lavinia. Another straight-to-video- adaptation was made in 1998, directed by Christopher Dunne, and starring Robert Reese as Titus, Candy K. Sweet as Tamora, Lexton Raleigh as Aaron, Tom Dennis as Demitrius, with Levi David Tinker as Chiron and Amanda Gezik as Lavinia. This version enhanced the violence and increased the gore. For example, in the opening scene, Alarbus has his face skinned alive, and is then disembowelled and set on fire.

In 1999, Julie Taymor directed an adaptation entitled &quot;Titus&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins as Titus, Jessica Lange as Tamora, Harry Lennix as Aaron (reprising his role from Taymor&#x27;s 1994 theatrical production) and Laura Fraser as Lavinia. As with Taymor&#x27;s stage production, the film begins with a young boy playing with toy soldiers and being whisked away to Ancient Rome, where he assumes the character of young Lucius. A major component of the film is the mixing of the old and modern; Chiron and Demetrius dress like modern rock stars, but the Andronici dress like Roman soldiers; some characters use chariots, some use cars and motorcycles; crossbows and swords are used alongside rifles and pistols; tanks are seen driven by soldiers in ancient Roman garb; bottled beer is seen alongside ancient amphorae of wine; microphones are used to address characters in ancient clothing. According to Taymor, this anachronistic structure was created to emphasise the timelessness of the violence in the film, to suggest that violence is universal to all humanity, at all times: &quot;Costume, paraphernalia, horses or chariots or cars; these represent the essence of a character, as opposed to placing it in a specific time. This is a film that takes place from the year 1 to the year 2000.&quot; At the end of the film, young Lucius takes the baby and walks out of Rome; an image of hope for the future, symbolised by the rising sun in the background. Originally, the film was to end as Taymor&#x27;s 1994 production had, with the implication that Lucius is going to kill Aaron&#x27;s baby, but during production of the film, actor Angus Macfadyen, who played Lucius, convinced Taymor that Lucius was an honourable man and wouldn&#x27;t go back on his word. Lisa S. Starks reads the film as a revisionist horror film and feels that Taymor is herself part of the process of twentieth century re-evaluation of the play: &quot;In adapting a play that has traditionally evoked critical condemnation, Taymor calls into question that judgement, thereby opening up the possibility for new readings and considerations of the play within the Shakespeare canon.&quot;

&quot;William Shakespeare&#x27;s Titus Andronicus&quot;, directed by Richard Griffin and starring Nigel Gore as Titus, Zoya Pierson as Tamora, Kevin Butler as Aaron and Molly Lloyd as Lavinia, was released direct to video in 2000. Shot on DV in and around Providence, Rhode Island with a budget of $12,000, the film is set in a modern business milieu. Saturninus is a corporate head who has inherited a company from his father, and the Goths feature as contemporary goths.

In 2017, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; was adapted as &quot;The Hungry&quot; by director Bornilla Chatterjee set in contemporary New Delhi, India. It stars Naseeruddin Shah as Tathagat Ahuja (representing Titus), Tisca Chopra as Tulsi Joshi (representing Tamora), Neeraj Kabi as Arun Kumar (Aaron) and Sayani Gupta as Loveleen Ahuja (Lavinia).

===Television===
In 1970, Finnish TV channel Yle TV1 screened an adaptation of the play written and directed by Jukka Sipilä, starring Leo Lastumäki as Titus, Iris-Lilja Lassila as Tamora, Eugene Holman as Aaron and Maija Leino as Lavinia.

In 1985, the BBC produced a version of the play for their &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; series. Directed by Jane Howell, the play was the thirty-seventh and final episode of the series and starred Trevor Peacock as Titus, Eileen Atkins as Tamora, Hugh Quarshie as Aaron and Anna Calder-Marshall as Lavinia. Because &quot;Titus&quot; was broadcast several months after the rest of the seventh season, it was rumoured that the BBC were worried about the violence in the play and that disagreements had arisen about censorship. This was inaccurate however, as the delay was actually caused by a BBC strike in 1984. The episode had been booked into the studio in February and March 1984, but the strike meant it could not shoot. When the strike ended, the studio could not be used as it was being used by another production, and then when the studio became available, the RSC was using Trevor Peacock, and filming did not take place until February 1985, a year later than planned. Initially, director Jane Howell wanted to set the play in present-day Northern Ireland, but she ultimately settled on a more conventional approach. All the body parts seen throughout were based upon real autopsy photographs, and were authenticated by the Royal College of Surgeons. The costumes of the Goths were based on punk outfits, with Chiron and Demetrius specifically based on the band KISS. For the scene when Chiron and Demetrius are killed, a large carcass is seen hanging nearby; this was a genuine lamb carcass purchased from a kosher butcher and smeared with Vaseline to make it gleam under the studio lighting. In an unusual design choice, Howell had the Roman populace all wear identical generic masks without mouths, so as to convey the idea that the Roman people were faceless and voiceless, as she felt the play depicted a society which &quot;seemed like a society where everyone was faceless except for those in power&quot;. The production was one of the most lauded plays of the series and garnered almost universally positive reviews.
For the most part, the adaptation followed Q1 exactly (and F1 for 3.2) with some minor alterations. For example, a few lines were cut from various scenes, such as Lavinia&#x27;s &quot;Ay, for these slips have made him noted long&quot; (2.3.87), thus removing the continuity error regarding the duration of the Goths&#x27; residence in Rome. Other examples include Titus&#x27; &quot;Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,/To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o&#x27;er,/How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?&quot; (3.2.26–28), Marcus&#x27; &quot;What, what! The lustful sons of Tamora/Performers of this heinous, bloody deed&quot; (4.1.78–79), and Titus and Marcus&#x27; brief conversation about Taurus and Aries (4.3.68–75). The adaptation also includes some lines from Q1 which were removed in subsequent editions; at 1.1.35 Titus&#x27; &quot;bearing his valiant sons/in coffins from the field&quot; continues with &quot;and at this day,/To the Monument of that Andronicy/Done sacrifice of expiation,/And slaine the Noblest prisoner of the Gothes.&quot; These lines are usually omitted because they create a continuity problem regarding the sacrifice of Alarbus, which has not happened yet in the text. However, Howell got around this problem by beginning the play at 1.1.64 – the entrance of Titus. Then, at 1.1.168, after the sacrifice of Alarbus, lines 1.1.1 to 1.1.63 (the introductions of Bassianus and Saturninus) take place, thus Titus&#x27; reference to Alarbus&#x27; sacrifice makes chronological sense.

Another notable stylistic technique used in the adaptation is multiple addresses direct to camera. For example, Saturninus&#x27; &quot;How well the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts&quot; (1.1.46); Tamora&#x27;s vow to slaughter the Andronici at 1.1.450–455 (thus absolving Saturninus from any involvement); Aaron&#x27;s soliloquy in 2.1; Aaron&#x27;s &quot;Ay, and as good as Saturninus may&quot; (2.1.91); Aaron&#x27;s soliloquy in 2.3; Tamora&#x27;s &quot;Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,/And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower&quot; (2.3.190–191); Aaron&#x27;s two asides in 3.1 (ll.187–190 and 201–202); Lucius&#x27; &quot;Now will I to the Goths and raise a power,/To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine&quot; (3.1.298–299); Marcus&#x27; &quot;O, heavens, can you hear a good man groan&quot; speech (4.1.122–129); Young Lucius&#x27; asides in 4.2 (ll.6 and 8–9); Aaron&#x27;s &quot;Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,/There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,/And secretly to greet the Empress&#x27; friends&quot; (4.2.172–174); and Tamora&#x27;s &quot;Now will I to that old Andronicus,/And temper him with all the art I have,/To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths&quot; (4.4.107–109).

The most significant difference from the original play concerned the character of Young Lucius, who is a much more important figure in the adaptation; he is present throughout Act 1, and retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene. Much as Julie Taymor would do in her 1999 filmic adaptation, Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production to prompt the question &quot;What are we doing to the children?&quot; At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, as he stares in horror at the coffin of Aaron&#x27;s child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became &quot;in part about a boy&#x27;s reaction to murder and mutilation. We see him losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy.&quot;

In 2001, the animated sitcom &quot;South Park&quot; based an episode on the play. In &quot;Scott Tenorman Must Die&quot;, Eric Cartman is swindled by Scott Tenorman. Cartman tries various methods to get his money back, but Scott remains always one step ahead. He then decides to exact revenge on Scott. After numerous failed attempts, he hatches a plan which culminates in him having Scott&#x27;s parents killed, the bodies of whom he then cooks in chili, which he feeds to Scott. He then gleefully reveals his deception as Scott finds his mother&#x27;s finger in the chilli.

The Netflix TV series &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; features a character originally named Ronald Wilkerson that changed his name to Titus Andromedon, possibly derived from this play.

===Radio===
The play has very rarely been staged for radio. In 1923, extracts were broadcast on BBC radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the second episode of a series of programs showcasing Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, entitled &quot;Shakespeare Night&quot;. In 1953, BBC Third Programme aired a 130-minute version of the play, adapted for radio by J. C. Trewin and starring Baliol Holloway as Titus, Sonia Dresdal as Tamora, George Hayes as Aaron and Janette Tregarthen as Lavinia. In 1973, BBC Radio 3 aired an adaptation directed by Martin Jenkins, starring Michael Aldridge as Titus, Barbara Jefford as Tamora, Julian Glover as Aaron and Frances Jeater as Lavinia. In 1986, Austrian radio channel Österreich 1 staged an adaptation by Kurt Klinger, starring Romuald Pekny as Titus, Marion Degler as Tamora, Wolfgang Böck as Aaron and Elisabeth Augustin as Lavinia.

<doc id="59376" wikidata="Q877906" url="?curid=59376" title="Thaana">
<text>Thaana, Tãna, Taana or Tāna (  ) is the present writing system of the Maldivian language spoken in the Maldives. Thaana has characteristics of both an abugida (diacritics, vowel-killer strokes) and a true alphabet (all vowels are written), with consonants derived from indigenous and Arabic numerals, and vowels derived from the vowel diacritics of the Arabic abjad. Maldivian orthography in Thaana is largely phonemic.

==Name==
H. C. P. Bell, the first serious researcher of Maldivian documents, used the spelling &quot;Tāna,&quot; as the initial consonant is unaspirated. The spelling &quot;Thaana&quot; was adopted in the mid-1970s, when the government of the Maldives embarked on a short period of Romanization; /t/ was transcribed , as was used for the voiceless retroflex plosive .

==History==

The Thaana script first appeared in a Maldivian inscription towards the beginning of the 17th century in a crude initial form known as Gabulhi (&#x27;incomplete&#x27;) Thaana which was written &quot;scripta continua&quot;. This early script slowly developed, its characters becoming more graceful and oblique, and adding spaces between words. As time went by it gradually replaced the older Dhives Akuru alphabet. The oldest written sample of the Thaana script is found in the island of Kanditheemu in &quot;Northern Miladhunmadulu Atoll&quot;. It is inscribed on the door posts of the main &quot;Hukuru Miskiy&quot; (Friday mosque) of the island and dates back to 1008 AH (AD 1599) and 1020 AH (AD 1611) when the roof of the building was built and then renewed during the reigns of Ibrahim Kalaafaan (Sultan Ibrahim III) and Hussain Faamuladeyri Kilege (Sultan Hussain II) respectively.

The origins of Thaana are unique among the world&#x27;s writing systems: The first nine letters (&quot;h ṣ n r b ḷ k ʔ v&quot;) are derived from the Arabic numerals, whereas the next nine (&quot;m f d t l g ṇ s ḍ&quot;) were the local Indic numerals. (See Hindu–Arabic numerals.) The remaining letters for loanwords (&quot;z ṭ y p j c ñ&quot;) and Arabic transliteration (&quot;h̤ ḵ ž ʕ ġ w ẕ t̤ ẓ s̱ q s̤ ż ś&quot;) are derived from phonetically similar native consonants by means of diacritics (like nuqta), with the exception of &quot;yaa&quot;, which is of unknown origin. This means that Thaana is one of the few writing systems not derived graphically from the original Semitic alphabet—unless the Indic numerals were (see Brahmi numerals). (The Ogham script used in 1st millennium AD Ireland is another example, which also has some relation to numbers, since most of its letters are differentiated from others in a way similar to tally marks.)

The order of the Thaana alphabet (&quot;ha, shaviyani, noonu, raa, baa, etc.&quot;) does not follow the order of other Indic scripts or of the Arabic script. There is no apparent logic to the order; this has been interpreted as suggesting that the script was scrambled to keep it secret from average islanders. The script was originally used primarily to write magical (&quot;fanḍita&quot;) incantations. These included Arabic quotations, written from right to left. Maldivian learned men, who were all well versed in sorcery, saw the advantages of writing in this simplified hidden script, and Thaana was gradually adopted for everyday use.

Thaana nearly disappeared for a brief period in recent history. Towards the mid-1970s, during President Ibrahim Nasir&#x27;s reign, Telex machines were introduced by the Maldivian government in the local administration. The new telex equipment was viewed as a great progress, but Thaana was deemed to be an obstacle because messages on the telex machines could only be written in the Latin script. Following this, a rough Latin transliteration for Maldivian was officially approved by the Maldivian government in 1976 and was quickly implemented by the administration. Booklets were printed and dispatched to all Atoll and Island Offices, as well as schools and merchant liners.

The Thaana script was reinstated by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom shortly after he took power in 1978, although the Latin transcription of 1976 continues to be widely used.

==Characteristics==
Thaana, like Arabic, is written right to left. It indicates vowels with diacritic marks derived from Arabic. Each letter must carry either a vowel or a &quot;sukun&quot; (which indicates &quot;no vowel&quot;). The only exception to this rule is &quot;nūnu&quot; which, when written without a diacritic, indicates prenasalization of a following stop.

For a sample text, see the article on Qaumee salaam, the Maldives&#x27; national anthem.

Even though it is not part of the alphabet, Arabic ligature Allah ﷲ is used for writing names in Thaana, for example (Abdullah). &quot;Allah&quot; is never written in thaana, with the ligature ﷲ used.

===Consonants===
The letter &quot;alifu&quot; (އ) is used for three different purposes other than acting as a normal consonant: it can act as a carrier for a vowel in the second part of a diphthong (if there is a preceding consonant with a vowel); when it carries a &quot;sukun&quot;, it indicates gemination (lengthening) of the following consonant (even if the consonant is at the beginning of another word); and if &quot;alifu&quot;+&quot;sukun&quot; occurs at the end of a word, it indicates that the word ends in a glottal stop. Gemination of nasal consonants, however, is indicated by &quot;noonu&quot;+&quot;sukun&quot; preceding the nasal to be geminated. Originally, each letter had the name &quot;consonant+&quot;a&quot;+&quot;viyani&quot;&quot;. The suffix -&quot;viyani&quot; originated from the word &quot;viyana&quot; which came from Sanskrit . For example, &quot;haa&quot; was originally called &quot;haviyani&quot;. The names of consonants which had equivalent sounds in Arabic were changed to the Arabic names for the sounds (excepting &quot;gaafu&quot;, which is a Persian name).


====&quot;Naviyani&quot;====
Naviyani (ޱ) represents the voiced retroflex nasal &quot;ṇ&quot; () common to many Indic languages. This letter was abolished from Maldivian official documents around 1953.

The letter&#x27;s former position in the Maldivian alphabet was the sixteenth, between Gaafu and Seenu, instead of Gnaviyani (ޏ). The former position of Gnaviyani (ޏ) was 22nd. It is still seen in reprints of old books like the &quot;Bodu Tarutheebu,&quot; and it is used by the people of Addu Atoll and Fuvahmulah when writing songs or poetry in their dialects as the sound is still present in their spoken dialects

====Additional letters====
These additional letters () were added to the Thaana alphabet by adding a  (dot) to existing letters, to allow for transliteration of Arabic loanwords (except for ޜ že), as previously Arabic loanwords were written using the Arabic script. Their usage is inconsistent, and becoming less frequent as the spelling changes to reflect pronunciation by Maldivians, rather than the original Arabic pronunciation, as the words get absorbed into the Maldivian language.

===Vowels===
There are five vowel strokes or diacritical signs () for short vowels (a, i, u, e, o). The first three are derived from the Arabic vowel signs, &quot;fatḥah, kasrah&quot; and &quot;ḍammah&quot;. The &quot;ebefili&quot; looks similar to and is most likely modelled on the Urdu baṛī ye. Long vowels (aa, ee, oo, ey and oa) are denoted by double &quot;fili&quot;, with the exception of oa, which is a modification of the short &quot;obofili&quot;.
== Unicode ==

Thaana was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.

The Unicode block for Thaana is U+0780–U+07BF:

<doc id="59377" wikidata="Q68039" url="?curid=59377" title="Zbigniew Boniek">
<text>Zbigniew Kazimierz Boniek (; born 3 March 1956) is a Polish former footballer and manager as well as a current UEFA vice-president. A former midfielder, who was also capable of playing mostly as a right winger and second striker, he is considered one of the greatest Polish players of all time, and was selected by Pelé as one of the 100 best living footballers in 2004.

In an 80-cap international career, Boniek scored 24 goals and played at three consecutive World Cups, helping Poland to 3rd place in 1982 and making the Team of the Tournament. His greatest achievements in club football were at Juventus in Italy, winning the Serie A, Coppa Italia, European Cup, European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, and European Super Cup between 1983 and 1985, being the first Polish footballer to win a confederation title and one of the first Central and Eastern European players to do so with a non-conational club. In 1978 and 1982, he won the Polish Footballer of the Year Award presented by the &quot;Piłka Nożna&quot; football weekly.

In the early 1990s, Boniek managed several Italian clubs, and also the Poland national team in 2002. In 2019, he was inducted in the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

==Club career==
Boniek was born in Bydgoszcz. He first played for Polish clubs Zawisza Bydgoszcz and later at Widzew Łódź.

Boniek transferred to Italian football giants Juventus in 1982. With Juventus he won the Coppa Italia in his first season, also managing a second-place finish in the league and reaching the 1983 European Cup Final in the same season. The following season, his performances proved decisive, as Juventus won both the Serie A title and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1984, with Boniek scoring the matching-winning goal in the 2–1 victory over Porto in the final of the latter tournament in Basel; he followed up these victories by claiming the European Super Cup later that year, scoring twice in the 2–0 win against Liverpool. He also won the European Cup in 1985, against Liverpool once again, winning the penalty that Michel Platini subsequently converted to win the title for Juventus, although the team&#x27;s victory was overshadowed by the Heysel Disaster.

The following season, Boniek joined Roma, where he won a second Coppa Italia in 1986, and eventually ended his professional career with the club in 1988.

==International career==
Boniek represented the Poland national team in 80 international matches between 1976 and 1988, and scored 24 goals. He took part at the 1978, 1982, and 1986 FIFA World Cups with Poland.

Although he initially only appeared as a substitute in Poland&#x27;s two opening group matches at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, he drew attention to himself when he scored two goals in a 3–1 victory over Mexico in Poland&#x27;s final match of the group stage, helping his nation top their group; in the second round, however, Poland finished third in their group and were eliminated from the tournament.

Boniek later starred in the Polish team that won a bronze medal at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain: he helped his team reach the semi-finals of the tournament, scoring four goals in the process. In the first round, he scored in a 5–1 win over Peru on 22 June, to help Poland top their group; in the second round, he scored a hat-trick in his nation&#x27;s 3–0 second round victory over Belgium, in Barcelona, on 28 June, but was forced to miss the semi-final defeat to eventual champions Italy due to a suspension after being booked in the 88th minute of a 0–0 draw against the Soviet Union.

He returned to the starting line-up for the victorious third-place match against France and was named to the team of the tournament for his performances throughout the competition. The 1986 FIFA World Cup was less successful, as Poland only qualified for the second round as the second best third-placed team, and were subsequently eliminated in the second round following a 4–0 defeat to Brazil.

==Style of play==
Although Boniek was usually deployed as a midfielder, he was also able to play as a forward. He preferred to operate between the lines in a free role, although he was a versatile player, capable of playing in several offensive and midfield positions on either flank or through the centre, and throughout his career he was deployed as an attacking midfielder, as a right winger, in a playmaking role as a central midfielder, as a centre-forward, or as a second striker; his Juventus manager, Giovanni Trapattoni, however, often struggled to find the most suitable position for him.

Boniek was known for his extroverted personality and his trademark moustache, which made him a highly recognisable player. A tall, brave and hard-working footballer with a large, powerful, and slender physique, he was known for his blistering pace, acceleration, and quick reactions. In particular, Boniek was highly regarded for his ability to make sudden attacking runs to beat the defensive line and get on the end of his teammates&#x27; long passes, especially those of Michel Platini, with whom he formed a close friendship and formidable partnership at the Turin club, which made him lethal on counterattacks; this prompted Diego Maradona to describe Boniek as “one of the finest players of their generation.”

A highly talented, creative, intelligent, and skilful footballer, he was one of the best dribblers of his time and also displayed superb technique, flair, and class. Although he was not a particularly prolific player, he was known for his eye for goal, and as his clinical finishing with either foot, as well as his head, which enabled him to maintain a consistent goalscoring rate throughout his career; he also earned a reputation for having the tendency to score decisive goals for his team in key matches.

Despite his ability, at times he was also criticised, however, for being tactically undisciplined, inconsistent, too static in his movements off the ball, and for not being involved enough in his team&#x27;s play during matches, which led him to struggle against opponents who did not give him a lot of space.

The Juventus president at the time of Boniek&#x27;s tenure with the club, Gianni Agnelli, nicknamed him &quot;Bello di notte&quot; (&quot;Beauty at night&quot;, which is a play on the title of the Buñuel movie &quot;Belle de Jour&quot;) because of his excellent performances in European club tournament matches, which were played in the evening; indeed, during continental tournaments, his opponents usually allowed him more space and time on the ball than in Serie A, which allowed him to get forward, undertake individual dribbling runs and score goals himself, or drop deep, link up with midfielders and create chances or provide assists for his teammates, courtesy of his passing, vision, and clever movement. He was also nicknamed Zibì by the Italian press.

Towards the end of his career, as he lost his pace, he often functioned in a defensive role as a sweeper.

==Managerial career==
Following his retirement, Boniek pursued a coaching career, but with less success; he also coached in Italy, with stints at Lecce in 1990–91, Bari in 1991–92, Sambenedettese in 1992–93, and Avellino in 1994–96.

Boniek has served as vice-president of the Polish Football Association, and in July 2002 he became the manager of Poland. He resigned in December 2002, after just five matches (2 wins, 1 draw, 2 defeats, including a 1–0 home loss against Latvia in a European Championship qualifier).

==Later career==
Following his retirement, Boniek had a successful business career. He later also worked as a pundit and football commentator. According to Polish sources, Boniek had been favoured to become the new Minister of Sport for his country, but he denied the claims and stated that he had no intention of taking the job.

In 2004, Boniek was named by Pelé as one of the 125 Greatest Living Footballers, as part of FIFA&#x27;s centenary celebrations. On 12 October 2009, he received the Golden Foot &#x27;Legend&#x27; career award.

On 26 October 2012, he became the chairman of the Polish Football Association. He is popular for speaking in favour of decriminalising football fans by legalising pyrotechnics inside stadiums, a common practice among ultras. His term of office ended on 18 August 2021, and he was succeeded by Cezary Kulesza.

==Personal life==
Boniek has a university diploma in education. His father, Józef Boniek, was also a professional football player and later a manager. In 1976, he married his wife Wiesława, a specialist in Romance studies, with whom he has three children: two daughters Karolina and Kamila and son Tomasz.

==Legacy==
Honduran international footballer Óscar Boniek García was given the middle name &quot;Boniek&quot; in honour of Zbigniew Boniek. García chose to have the name &quot;Boniek&quot; written across the back of his jersey while playing for Houston.

Boniek Forbes (born 30 September 1983) is a Guinea-Bissau footballer who plays as a winger for Cheshunt. He played for Leyton Orient in the Football League.

In 2018, Boniek became an honorary citizen of Łódź. In 2019, he was named the most influential person in Polish sport by the Forbes Polska magazine and Pentagon Research. The same year, he was voted as a member of Poland&#x27;s Team of the Century in a poll organized on the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the Polish Football Association.

In 2020, Boniek&#x27;s biography entitled &quot;Zibi, czyli Boniek&quot; written by Roman Kołtoń was published. The footballer himself also published his autobiography the same year entitled &quot;Zbigniew Boniek. Mecze mojego życia&quot; (Zbigniew Boniek: The Matches of My Life).

<text>John Dryden (; – ) was an English poet, literary critic, translator, and playwright who in 1668 was appointed England&#x27;s first Poet Laureate.

He is seen as dominating the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden. Romantic writer Sir Walter Scott called him &quot;Glorious John&quot;.

==Early life==
Dryden was born in the village rectory of Aldwincle near Thrapston in Northamptonshire, where his maternal grandfather was the rector of All Saints. He was the eldest of fourteen children born to Erasmus Dryden and wife Mary Pickering, paternal grandson of Sir Erasmus Dryden, 1st Baronet (1553–1632), and wife Frances Wilkes, Puritan landowning gentry who supported the Puritan cause and Parliament. He was a second cousin once removed of Jonathan Swift. As a boy, Dryden lived in the nearby village of Titchmarsh, where it is likely that he received his first education. In 1644 he was sent to Westminster School as a King&#x27;s Scholar where his headmaster was Richard Busby, a charismatic teacher and severe disciplinarian. Having been re-founded by Elizabeth I, Westminster during this period embraced a very different religious and political spirit encouraging royalism and high Anglicanism. Whatever Dryden&#x27;s response to this was, he clearly respected the headmaster and would later send two of his sons to school at Westminster.

As a humanist public school, Westminster maintained a curriculum which trained pupils in the art of rhetoric and the presentation of arguments for both sides of a given issue. This is a skill which would remain with Dryden and influence his later writing and thinking, as much of it displays these dialectical patterns. The Westminster curriculum included weekly translation assignments which developed Dryden&#x27;s capacity for assimilation. This was also to be exhibited in his later works. His years at Westminster were not uneventful, and his first published poem, an elegy with a strong royalist feel on the death of his schoolmate Henry, Lord Hastings, from smallpox, alludes to the execution of King Charles I, which took place on 30 January 1649, very near the school where Busby had first prayed for the King and then locked in his schoolboys to prevent their attending the spectacle.

In 1650 Dryden went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. Here he would have experienced a return to the religious and political ethos of his childhood: the Master of Trinity was a Puritan preacher by the name of Thomas Hill who had been a rector in Dryden&#x27;s home village. Though there is little specific information on Dryden&#x27;s undergraduate years, he would most certainly have followed the standard curriculum of classics, rhetoric, and mathematics. In 1654 he obtained his BA, graduating top of the list for Trinity that year. In June of the same year Dryden&#x27;s father died, leaving him some land which generated a little income, but not enough to live on.

Returning to London during the Protectorate, Dryden obtained work with Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Secretary of State, John Thurloe. This appointment may have been the result of influence exercised on his behalf by his cousin the Lord Chamberlain, Sir Gilbert Pickering. At Cromwell&#x27;s funeral on 23 November 1658 Dryden processed with the Puritan poets John Milton and Andrew Marvell. Shortly thereafter he published his first important poem, &quot;Heroic Stanzas&quot; (1659), a eulogy on Cromwell&#x27;s death which is cautious and prudent in its emotional display. In 1660 Dryden celebrated the Restoration of the monarchy and the return of Charles II with &quot;Astraea Redux&quot;, an authentic royalist panegyric. In this work the Interregnum is illustrated as a time of chaos, and Charles is seen as the restorer of peace and order.

==Later life and career==
After the Restoration, as Dryden quickly established himself as the leading poet and literary critic of his day, he transferred his allegiances to the new government. Along with &quot;Astraea Redux&quot;, Dryden welcomed the new regime with two more panegyrics: &quot;To His Sacred Majesty: A Panegyric on his Coronation&quot; (1662) and &quot;To My Lord Chancellor&quot; (1662). These poems suggest that Dryden was looking to court a possible patron, but he was to instead make a living in writing for publishers, not for the aristocracy, and thus ultimately for the reading public. These, and his other nondramatic poems, are occasional—that is, they celebrate public events. Thus they are written for the nation rather than the self, and the Poet Laureate (as he would later become) is obliged to write a certain number of these per annum. In November 1662, Dryden was proposed for membership in the Royal Society, and he was elected an early fellow. However, Dryden was inactive in Society affairs and in 1666 was expelled for non-payment of his dues.
On 1 December 1663, Dryden married the royalist sister of Sir Robert Howard—Lady Elizabeth. Dryden&#x27;s works occasionally contain outbursts against the married state but also celebrations of the same. Thus, little is known of the intimate side of his marriage. Lady Elizabeth bore three sons, one of whom (Erasmus Henry) became a Roman Catholic priest.

With the reopening of the theatres in 1660 after the Puritan ban, Dryden began writing plays. His first play &quot;The Wild Gallant&quot; appeared in 1663, and was not successful, but was still promising, and from 1668 on he was contracted to produce three plays a year for the King&#x27;s Company in which he became a shareholder. During the 1660s and 1670s, theatrical writing was his main source of income. He led the way in Restoration comedy, his best-known work being &quot;Marriage à la Mode&quot; (1673), as well as heroic tragedy and regular tragedy, in which his greatest success was &quot;All for Love&quot; (1678). 

Dryden was never satisfied with his theatrical writings and frequently suggested that his talents were wasted on unworthy audiences. He thus was making a bid for poetic fame off-stage. In 1667, around the same time his dramatic career began, he published &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot;, a lengthy historical poem which described the English defeat of the Dutch naval fleet and the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was a modern epic in pentameter quatrains that established him as the preeminent poet of his generation, and was crucial in his attaining the posts of Poet Laureate (1668) and historiographer royal (1670).

When the Great Plague of London closed the theatres in 1665, Dryden retreated to Wiltshire where he wrote &quot;Of Dramatick Poesie&quot; (1668), arguably the best of his unsystematic prefaces and essays. Dryden constantly defended his own literary practice, and &quot;Of Dramatick Poesie&quot;, the longest of his critical works, takes the form of a dialogue in which four characters—each based on a prominent contemporary, with Dryden himself as &#x27;Neander&#x27;—debate the merits of classical, French and English drama. The greater part of his critical works introduce problems which he is eager to discuss, and show the work of a writer of independent mind who feels strongly about his own ideas, ideas which demonstrate the breadth of his reading. He felt strongly about the relation of the poet to tradition and the creative process, and his best heroic play &quot;Aureng-zebe&quot; (1675) has a prologue which denounces the use of rhyme in serious drama. His play &quot;All for Love&quot; (1678) was written in blank verse, and was to immediately follow &quot;Aureng-Zebe&quot;.

Dryden&#x27;s poem &quot;An Essay upon Satire&quot; contained a number of attacks on King Charles II, his mistresses and courtiers, but most pointedly on the Earl of Rochester, a notorious womaniser. Rochester responded by hiring thugs who attacked Dryden whilst walking back from Will&#x27;s Coffee House (a popular London coffee house where the Wits gathered to gossip, drink and conduct their business) to his house on Gerrard Street. 
At around 8 pm on 18 December 1679, Dryden was attacked in Rose Alley behind the Lamb &amp; Flag pub, near his home in Covent Garden. Dryden survived the attack, offering £50 for the identity of the thugs placed in the London Gazette, and a Royal Pardon if one of them would confess. No one claimed the reward.

Dryden&#x27;s greatest achievements were in satiric verse: the mock-heroic &quot;Mac Flecknoe&quot;, a more personal product of his laureate years, was a lampoon circulated in manuscript and an attack on the playwright Thomas Shadwell. Dryden&#x27;s main goal in the work is to &quot;satirize Shadwell, ostensibly for his offenses against literature but more immediately we may suppose for his habitual badgering of him on the stage and in print.&quot; It is not a belittling form of satire, but rather one which makes his object great in ways which are unexpected, transferring the ridiculous into poetry. This line of satire continued with &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; (1681) and &quot;The Medal&quot; (1682). His other major works from this period are the religious poems &quot;Religio Laici&quot; (1682), written from the position of a member of the Church of England; his 1683 edition of &quot;Plutarch&#x27;s Lives Translated From the Greek by Several Hands&quot; in which he introduced the word &#x27;biography&#x27; to English readers; and &quot;The Hind and the Panther,&quot; (1687) which celebrates his conversion to Roman Catholicism.

He wrote &quot;Britannia Rediviva&quot; celebrating the birth of a son and heir to the Catholic King and Queen on 10 June 1688. 

When, later in the same year, James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution, Dryden&#x27;s refusal to take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs, William and Mary, left him out of favour at court. Thomas Shadwell succeeded him as Poet Laureate, and he was forced to give up his public offices and live by the proceeds of his pen. Dryden translated works by Horace, Juvenal, Ovid, Lucretius, and Theocritus, a task which he found far more satisfying than writing for the stage. In 1694 he began work on what would be his most ambitious and defining work as translator, &quot;The Works of Virgil&quot; (1697), which was published by subscription. The publication of the translation of Virgil was a national event and brought Dryden the sum of £1,400. Dryden translated the &quot;Aeneid&quot; into couplets, turning Virgil&#x27;s almost 10,000 lines into 13,700 lines; Joseph Addison wrote the (prose) prefaces for each book, and William Congreve checked the translation against the Latin original. His final translations appeared in the volume &quot;Fables Ancient and Modern&quot; (1700), a series of episodes from Homer, Ovid, and Boccaccio, as well as modernised adaptations from Geoffrey Chaucer interspersed with Dryden&#x27;s own poems. As a translator, he made great literary works in the older languages available to readers of English.

==Death==
Dryden died on 12 May 1700, and was initially buried in St. Anne&#x27;s cemetery in Soho, before being exhumed and reburied in Westminster Abbey ten days later. He was the subject of poetic eulogies, such as &quot;Luctus Brittannici: or the Tears of the British Muses; for the Death of John Dryden, Esq.&quot; (London, 1700), and &quot;The Nine Muses&quot;. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque commemorates Dryden at 43 Gerrard Street in London&#x27;s Chinatown. He lived at 137 Long Acre from 1682 to 1686 and at 43 Gerrard Street from 1686 until his death.

In his will, he left The George Inn at Northampton to trustees, to form a school for the children of the poor of the town. This became John Dryden&#x27;s School, later The Orange School.

==Reputation and influence==
Dryden was the dominant literary figure and influence of his age. He established the heroic couplet as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires, religious pieces, fables, epigrams, compliments, prologues, and plays with it; he also introduced the alexandrine and triplet into the form. In his poems, translations, and criticism, he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic couplet—Auden referred to him as &quot;the master of the middle style&quot;—that was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the 18th century. The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident in the elegies written about him. Dryden&#x27;s heroic couplet became the dominant poetic form of the 18th century. Alexander Pope was heavily influenced by Dryden and often borrowed from him; other writers were equally influenced by Dryden and Pope. Pope famously praised Dryden&#x27;s versification in his imitation of Horace&#x27;s Epistle II.i: &quot;Dryden taught to join / The varying pause, the full resounding line, / The long majestic march, and energy divine.&quot; Samuel Johnson summed up the general attitude with his remark that &quot;the veneration with which his name is pronounced by every cultivator of English literature, is paid to him as he refined the language, improved the sentiments, and tuned the numbers of English poetry.&quot; His poems were very widely read, and are often quoted, for instance, in Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot; and Johnson&#x27;s essays.

Johnson also noted, however, that &quot;He is, therefore, with all his variety of excellence, not often pathetic; and had so little sensibility of the power of effusions purely natural, that he did not esteem them in others. Simplicity gave him no pleasure.&quot; Readers in the first half of the 18th century did not mind this too much, but later generations considered Dryden&#x27;s absence of sensibility a fault.

One of the first attacks on Dryden&#x27;s reputation was by William Wordsworth, who complained that Dryden&#x27;s descriptions of natural objects in his translations from Virgil were much inferior to the originals. However, several of Wordsworth&#x27;s contemporaries, such as George Crabbe, Lord Byron, and Walter Scott (who edited Dryden&#x27;s works), were still keen admirers of Dryden. Besides, Wordsworth did admire many of Dryden&#x27;s poems, and his famous &quot;Intimations of Immortality&quot; ode owes something stylistically to Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot;. John Keats admired the &quot;Fables&quot;, and imitated them in his poem &quot;Lamia&quot;. Later 19th-century writers had little use for verse satire, Pope, or Dryden; Matthew Arnold famously dismissed them as &quot;classics of our prose&quot;. He did have a committed admirer in George Saintsbury, and was a prominent figure in quotation books such as Bartlett&#x27;s, but the next major poet to take an interest in Dryden was T. S. Eliot, who wrote that he was &quot;the ancestor of nearly all that is best in the poetry of the eighteenth century&quot;, and that &quot;we cannot fully enjoy or rightly estimate a hundred years of English poetry unless we fully enjoy Dryden.&quot; However, in the same essay, Eliot accused Dryden of having a &quot;commonplace mind&quot;. Critical interest in Dryden has increased recently, but, as a relatively straightforward writer (William Empson, another modern admirer of Dryden, compared his &quot;flat&quot; use of language with Donne&#x27;s interest in the &quot;echoes and recesses of words&quot;), his work has not occasioned as much interest as Andrew Marvell&#x27;s, John Donne&#x27;s or Pope&#x27;s.

Dryden is believed to be the first person to assert that English sentences should not end in prepositions because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions. Dryden created the proscription against preposition stranding in 1672 when he objected to Ben Jonson&#x27;s 1611 phrase, &#x27;The bodies that those souls were frighted from.&#x27; However, he did not provide the rationale for his preference. Dryden often translated his writing into Latin, to check whether his writing was concise and elegant, Latin being considered an elegant and long-lived language with which to compare; then Dryden translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions, Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English, thus forming the rule of no sentence-ending prepositions, subsequently adopted by other writers.

The phrase &quot;blaze of glory&quot; is believed to have originated in Dryden&#x27;s 1686 poem &quot;The Hind and the Panther&quot;, referring to the throne of God as a &quot;blaze of glory that forbids the sight.&quot;

==Poetic style==
What Dryden achieved in his poetry was neither the emotional excitement of the early nineteenth-century romantics nor the intellectual complexities of the metaphysicals. His subject matter was often factual, and he aimed at expressing his thoughts in the most precise and concentrated manner. Although he uses formal structures such as heroic couplets, he tried to recreate the natural rhythm of speech, and he knew that different subjects need different kinds of verse. In his preface to &quot;Religio Laici&quot; he says that &quot;the expressions of a poem designed purely for instruction ought to be plain and natural, yet majestic... The florid, elevated and figurative way is for the passions; for (these) are begotten in the soul by showing the objects out of their true proportion... A man is to be cheated into passion, but to be reasoned into truth.&quot;

===Translation style===
While Dryden had many admirers, he also had his share of critics, Mark Van Doren among them. Van Doren complained that in translating Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Dryden had added &quot;a fund of phrases with which he could expand any passage that seemed to him curt.&quot; Dryden did not feel such expansion was a fault, arguing that as Latin is a naturally concise language it cannot be duly represented by a comparable number of words in English. &quot;He...recognized that Virgil &#x27;had the advantage of a language wherein much may be comprehended in a little space&#x27; (5:329–30). The &#x27;way to please the best Judges...is not to Translate a Poet literally; and Virgil least of any other&#x27; (5:329).&quot;

For example, take lines 789–795 of Book 2 when Aeneas sees and receives a message from the ghost of his wife, Creusa.

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;iamque vale et nati serva communis amorem.″&quot;
&quot;haec ubi dicta dedit, lacrimantem et multa volentem&quot;
&quot;dicere deseruit, tenuisque recessit in auras.&quot;
&quot;ter conatus ibi collo dare bracchia circum;&quot;
&quot;ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago,&quot;
&quot;par levibus ventis volucrique simillima somno.&quot;
&quot;sic demum socios consumpta nocte reviso&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Dryden translates it like this:

&lt;poem&gt;I trust our common issue to your care.&#x27;
She said, and gliding pass&#x27;d unseen in air.
I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;
And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,
And, thrice deceiv&#x27;d, on vain embraces hung.
Light as an empty dream at break of day,
Or as a blast of wind, she rush&#x27;d away.
Thus having pass&#x27;d the night in fruitless pain,
I to my longing friends return again&lt;/poem&gt;

Dryden&#x27;s translation is based on presumed authorial intent and smooth English. In line 790 the literal translation of &quot;haec ubi dicta dedit&quot; is &quot;when she gave these words.&quot; But &quot;she said&quot; gets the point across, uses half the words, and makes for better English. A few lines later, with &quot;ter conatus ibi collo dare bracchia circum; ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago&quot;, he alters the literal translation &quot;Thrice trying to give arms around her neck; thrice the image grasped in vain fled the hands,&quot; in order to fit it into the metre and the emotion of the scene.

In his own words,

The way I have taken, is not so streight as Metaphrase, nor so loose as Paraphrase: Some things too I have omitted, and sometimes added of my own. Yet the omissions I hope, are but of Circumstances, and such as wou&#x27;d have no grace in English; and the Addition, I also hope, are easily deduc&#x27;d from Virgil&#x27;s Sense. They will seem (at least I have the Vanity to think so), not struck into him, but growing out of him. (5:529)

In a similar vein, Dryden writes in his Preface to the translation anthology &quot;Sylvae&quot;:

Where I have taken away some of [the original authors&#x27;] Expressions, and cut them shorter, it may possibly be on this consideration, that what was beautiful in the Greek or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English; and where I have enlarg’d them, I desire the false Criticks would not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc’d from him; or at least, if both those considerations should fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if he were living, and an Englishman, they are such as he wou’d probably have written.

==Personal life==
On 1 December 1663, Dryden married Lady Elizabeth Howard (died 1714) at St Swithin&#x27;s, London, and the consent of the parents is noted on the licence, although Lady Elizabeth was then about twenty-five. 

The couple met after 1660, when Dryden began lodging in London with her brother, Sir Robert Howard, son of the earl of Berkshire. The marriage lasted until his death, but there is little evidence about how they lived as a couple. A small estate in Wiltshire was settled upon them by her father. The lady&#x27;s intellect and temper were apparently not good; her husband was treated as an inferior by those of her social status. 

Both Dryden and his wife were warmly attached to their children. They had three sons: Charles (1666–1704), John (1668–1701), and Erasmus Henry (1669–1710). Lady Elizabeth Dryden survived her husband, but reportedly lost her wits after becoming a widow. Although some have historically claimed to be from the lineage of John Dryden, his three children, one of whom became a Roman Catholic priest, had no children themselves.

<text>Dorchester County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. At the 2020 census, the population was 32,531. Its county seat is Cambridge. The county was formed in 1669 and named for the Earl of Dorset, a family friend of the Calverts (the founding family of the Maryland colony). The county is part of the Mid-Eastern Shore region of the state.

Dorchester County comprises the Cambridge, MD Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Salisbury-Cambridge, MD-DE Combined Statistical Area.

Dorchester County is the largest county by total area in Maryland. It is bordered by the Choptank River to the north, Talbot County to the northwest, Caroline County to the northeast, Wicomico County to the southeast, Sussex County, Delaware, to the east, and the Chesapeake Bay to the west. Dorchester County uses the slogan, &quot;The Heart of Chesapeake Country&quot;, due to its geographical location and the heart-like shape of the county on a map.

==History==
Many residents of Dorchester County have historically been watermen and farmers. The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries provide harvests of crabs, oysters and many fish species to both commercial and recreational fishermen. Dorchester County was the birthplace of Harriet Tubman, who escaped from slavery and afterward worked to guide other refugee slaves to freedom in the North.

Dorchester County has been hit by two deadly tornadoes. The first occurred on June 23, 1944, in Cambridge, where two people were killed and 33 were injured. The other was on May 8, 1984, in Hurlock, where one death and six injuries were reported. Both storms caused between 500,000 and 5 million dollars of damage.

==Politics, government and law==
Dorchester County operates under the charter home rule form of government, and the affairs of the county are managed by five county council members. Each is elected from a single-member district defined within the county. Meetings of the county council are held weekly. The agenda and the minutes of each week&#x27;s proceedings are public record.

In earlier times, unlike highly secessionist Wicomico, Worcester, Queen Anne&#x27;s and Cecil counties, Dorchester was a swing county in the late 19th century due to the voting power of its freedman population, who strongly supported the Republican Party. The conservative whites voted Democratic for William Jennings Bryan in 1908, after Maryland had passed laws raising barriers to voter registration among blacks, resulting in a dramatic drop in their voting until after passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s.

The white population of Dorchester has historically voted very conservatively. Along with rock-ribbed Unionist Garrett County, located in Appalachia, its white majority was one of only two Maryland counties to vote for Barry Goldwater in 1964. During the following election, Dorchester was the only county in the state where the segregationist George Wallace outpolled either Nixon or Humphrey. In the late 20th century, white conservatives in the South shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Since then the only Democratic presidential nominee to carry Dorchester County was southern native son Bill Clinton in 1996.

The county has trended less conservative in recent years, with Democrat Barack Obama coming within five percentage points of beating Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election; Obama won nationally.

<text>Kent County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 census, its population was 19,198, making it the least populous county in Maryland. Its county seat is Chestertown. The county was named for the county of Kent in England. The county is part of the Mid-Eastern Shore region of the state and is the oldest county in Maryland.

Along with Caroline and Garrett Counties, it is one of three counties in the state that are not part of a metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
In 1608, Captain John Smith explored and mapped a portion of what is now Kent County. In 1642, the governor and council appointed commissioners for the Isle and County of Kent. This act appears to have led to the establishment of Kent County. In 1675, the first county seat was New Yarmouth. The seat was briefly moved upriver to Quaker Neck, and then to the site of modern Chestertown. Before the American Revolution, New Town on Chester, now Chestertown, was a port entry for the counties of Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne&#x27;s.

The county has a number of properties which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Kent County was the mean center of U.S. population in the 1790 census.

In 1793, the county had its first newspaper, called &quot;Apollo&quot;, or &quot;Chestertown Spy.&quot; It was succeeded by local papers such as the &quot;Chestertown Gazette&quot;.

Washington College, the oldest college in Maryland, is located in Kent County. It was the first college charted in the nation after the Declaration of Independence and was founded by William Smith in 1782. George Washington authorized the use of his name and gave the college its largest gift of 50 guineas. Washington served on the Board of Visitors and Governors for five years. The college has been host to four United States Presidents, including George Washington, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. All were awarded honorary degrees from the college.

===War of 1812===
The War of 1812 was the only war Kent County experienced on its soil. During the spring and summer of both 1813 and 1814, residents faced immediate threats from the enemy as the British terrorized the Chesapeake, looting and burning farms and towns. Kent County citizens and local militia were tested and stood their ground with ingenuity and determination during the burning of Georgetown, the rescue of the Kitty Knight House and the Battle of Caulk&#x27;s Field.

== Historical churches ==
St. Paul&#x27;s, the oldest Episcopal Church in Maryland used continuously as a place of worship. The earliest part of the building was constructed in 1711. It is located approximately nine miles west of Chestertown.

Christ Church, frequently called I.U., was founded in 1765. Colonel Philip Reed a Continental Army and War of 1812 soldier is buried here.

Shrewsbury Church is believed to be the first structure erected in the county, in 1693. John Cadwalader is buried in the Shrewsbury churchyard. The eulogy on his tomb was written by Thomas Paine.

==Politics and government==
Kent County was granted home rule in 1970 under a state code.

In the early post-Civil War era, Kent County was heavily Confederate-leaning and leaned towards the Democratic Party. William McKinley was the only Republican to carry the county between 1876 and 1924. After that, although carried by Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman during the five consecutive Democratic victories between 1932 and 1948, the county trended Republican relative to national voting. Currently, along with Talbot County further south, Kent County is the most politically competitive county on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush won it with 52.8% of the vote to Democrat John Kerry&#x27;s 46.1%. In the 2008 United States Presidential Election, Barack Obama won Kent County by 48 votes more than John McCain. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney won Kent County by 28 votes over Democrat Barack Obama. In 2016, Republican Donald Trump won Kent County with 48.7% of the vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 45.7%, and a 20-year record high of 5.7% of the vote for third-party candidates. In 2020, Joe Biden flipped the county, winning it by 134 votes. In 2024, the county voted for Trump again, this time over Kamala Harris.

The members of the County Council as of 2022 are:

Kent County lies wholly in Senate District 36 and elects three House of Delegates Members who serve at-large countywide. Members listed below as of 2018 are:

<text>Gordon McBean is a Canadian climatologist who serves as chairman of the board of trustees of the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences. He is a professor at the University of Western Ontario and Chair for Policy in the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction. Previously he was the Assistant Deputy Minister of Meteorological Service of Canada.

==Biography==
Professor McBean was born in British Columbia, Canada. He studied physics at McGill University and obtained a PhD in physics and oceanography from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, in 1970.

From 1970 to 1988, McBean was a scientist with Environment Canada. In 1988, he became Professor of Geography and Chair of the Atmospheric Sciences Program and in 1992, Professor of Oceanography and Head of the Department of Oceanography. He returned to Environment Canada as Assistant Deputy Minister from 1994 to 2000, responsible for climate, weather and air quality sciences and services in the federal government.

In 1995, McBean gave a speech to the World Meteorological Organization on global warming. In 2006, McBean, with Andrew Weaver and Ken Denman, authored an open letter, signed by 90 Canadian climate scientists, to Prime Minister Stephen Harper calling for an effective national climate change strategy.
The letter was a response to an earlier open letter to Harper from 60 scientists (seven of them climatologists, 19 of them Canadians) arguing against the Kyoto accord and questioning its scientific basis.

In addition to his involvement with the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, McBean is member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences partnerships committee and since 2014 president of the International Council for Science (ICSU) (before 2014 member of the environment advisory committee).

In 2018, he was professor in the Departments of Geography, Political Science and Physics at the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, and is currently Director of Policy Studies at the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction and Co-Director of the Centre for Environment and Sustainability there. He also acts as a mentor for the Loran Scholars Foundation.

==Awards and honours==
* MSC Patterson Medal, 1989
* CMOS President&#x27;s Prize
* Environment Canada Jim Bruce Award
* McBean has been a long-standing contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an organisation that was jointly awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize together with Al Gore.
* In 2010, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.
* In 2011, he was made a Member of the Order of Ontario.
* In 2015, he received the AGU Ambassador Award and was made a Fellow of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.

<doc id="59385" wikidata="Q131227" url="?curid=59385" title="Amanita muscaria">
<text>Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete of the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;. It is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, and usually red mushroom.

Despite its easily distinguishable features, &quot;A.muscaria&quot; is a fungus with several known variations, or subspecies. These subspecies are slightly different, some having yellow or white caps, but are all usually called fly agarics, most often recognizable by their notable white spots. Recent DNA fungi research, however, has shown that some mushrooms called &quot;fly agaric&quot; are in fact unique species, such as &quot;A.persicina&quot; (the peach-colored fly agaric).

Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, &quot;A.muscaria&quot; has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.

Although poisonous, death due to poisoning from &quot;A.muscaria&quot; ingestion is quite rare. Parboiling twice with water weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom&#x27;s psychoactive substances; it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. All &quot;A.muscaria&quot; varieties, but in particular &quot;A.muscaria&quot; var. &quot;muscaria&quot;, are noted for their hallucinogenic properties, with the main psychoactive constituents being muscimol and its neurotoxic precursor ibotenic acid. A local variety of the mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the indigenous peoples of Siberia.

Arguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is one of the most recognizable fungi in the world, and is widely encountered in popular culture, including in video games—for example, the frequent use of a recognizable &quot;A.muscaria&quot; in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise (e.g. its Super Mushroom power-up)—and television—for example, the houses in &quot;The Smurfs&quot; franchise. There have been cases of children admitted to hospitals after consuming this poisonous mushroom; the children may have been attracted to it because of its pop-culture associations.

==Taxonomy==
The name of the mushroom in many European languages is thought to derive from its use as an insecticide when sprinkled in milk. This practice has been recorded from Germanic- and Slavic-speaking parts of Europe, as well as the Vosges region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania. Albertus Magnus was the first to record it in his work &quot;De vegetabilibus&quot; some time before 1256, commenting &quot;vocatur fungus muscarum, eo quod in lacte pulverizatus interficit muscas&quot; (&quot;it is called the fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies&quot;).

The 16th-century Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius traced the practice of sprinkling it into milk to Frankfurt in Germany, while Carl Linnaeus, the &quot;father of taxonomy&quot;, reported it from Småland in southern Sweden, where he had lived as a child. He described it in volume two of his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753, giving it the name &quot;Agaricus muscarius&quot;, the specific epithet deriving from Latin &quot;musca&quot; meaning &quot;fly&quot;. It gained its current name in 1783, when placed in the genus &quot;Amanita&quot; by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, a name sanctioned in 1821 by the &quot;father of mycology&quot;, Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries. The starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as January 1, 1821, the date of Fries&#x27;s work, and so the full name was then &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (L.:Fr.) Hook. The 1987 edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus&#x27;s work. Hence, Linnaeus and Lamarck are now taken as the namers of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (L.) Lam..

The English mycologist John Ramsbottom reported that &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; was used for getting rid of bugs in England and Sweden, and &quot;bug agaric&quot; was an old alternative name for the species. French mycologist Pierre Bulliard reported having tried without success to replicate its fly-killing properties in his work &quot;&quot; (1784), and proposed a new binomial name &quot;Agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus&quot; because of this. One compound isolated from the fungus is 1,3-diolein (1,3-di(cis-9-octadecenoyl)glycerol), which attracts insects.
It has been hypothesised that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its intoxicating properties.
An alternative derivation proposes that the term &quot;fly-&quot; refers not to insects as such but rather the delirium resulting from consumption of the fungus. This is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person&#x27;s head and cause mental illness. Several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation, meaning the &quot;mad&quot; or &quot;fool&#x27;s&quot; version of the highly regarded edible mushroom &quot;Amanita caesarea&quot;. Hence there is &#x27; &quot;mad oriol&quot; in Catalan, &quot;mujolo folo&quot; from Toulouse, &#x27; from the Aveyron department in Southern France, &quot;&quot; from Trentino in Italy. A local dialect name in Fribourg in Switzerland is &quot;tsapi de diablhou&quot;, which translates as &quot;Devil&#x27;s hat&quot;.

===Classification===
&quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; is the type species of the genus. By extension, it is also the type species of &quot;Amanita&quot; subgenus &quot;Amanita&quot;, as well as section &quot;Amanita&quot; within this subgenus. &quot;Amanita&quot; subgenus &quot;Amanita&quot; includes all &quot;Amanita&quot; with inamyloid spores. &quot;Amanita&quot; section &quot;Amanita&quot; includes the species with patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings, and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. &quot;Amanita&quot; section &quot;Amanita&quot; consists of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; and its close relatives, including &quot;A. pantherina&quot; (the panther cap), &quot;A. gemmata&quot;, &quot;A. farinosa&quot;, and &quot;A. xanthocephala&quot;. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.

==Description==

A large, conspicuous mushroom, &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development.
Fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage reveals a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil, which helps identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens. Fully grown, the bright red cap is usually around in diameter, although larger specimens have been found. The red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms.

The free gills are white, as is the spore print. The oval spores measure 9–13 by 6.5–9 μm; they do not turn blue with the application of iodine. The stipe is white, high by wide, and has the slightly brittle, fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms. At the base is a bulb that bears universal veil remnants in the form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs. Between the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the partial veil (which covers the gills during development) in the form of a white ring. It can be quite wide and flaccid with age. There is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness.

Although very distinctive in appearance, the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the Americas, such as &quot;Armillaria&quot; cf. &quot;mellea&quot; and the edible &quot;A. basii&quot;—a Mexican species similar to &quot;A. caesarea&quot; of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that (Spanish for &#x27;yellow&#x27;) is a common name for the &quot;A. caesarea&quot;-like species in Mexico. &quot;A. caesarea&quot; is distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap, which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric (though these sometimes wash away during heavy rain). Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of &quot;A. caesarea&quot; are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may be confused with the native vermilion grisette (&quot;Amanita xanthocephala&quot;), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; and bears no ring. Additionally, immature button forms resemble puffballs.

=== Controversy ===
&quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; varies considerably in its morphology, and many authorities recognize several subspecies or varieties within the species. In &quot;The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy&quot;, German mycologist Rolf Singer listed three subspecies, though without description: &quot;A. muscaria&quot; ssp. &quot;muscaria&quot;, &quot;A. muscaria&quot; ssp. &quot;americana&quot;, and &quot;A. muscaria&quot; ssp. &quot;flavivolvata&quot;.

However, a 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; by mycologist József Geml and colleagues found three distinct clades within this species representing, roughly, Eurasian, Eurasian &quot;subalpine&quot;, and North American populations. Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of diversification for this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of the species: var. &quot;alba&quot;, var. &quot;flavivolvata&quot;, var. &quot;formosa&quot; (including var. &quot;guessowii&quot;), and var. &quot;regalis&quot; from both areas. All four varieties were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that these morphological forms are polymorphisms rather than distinct subspecies or varieties. Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak–hickory–pine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on Santa Cruz Island in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species. Thus &quot;A. muscaria&quot; as it stands currently is, evidently, a species complex. The complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded as species: &quot;A. breckonii&quot; is a buff-capped mushroom associated with conifers from the Pacific Northwest, and the brown-capped &quot;A. gioiosa&quot; and &quot;A. heterochroma&quot; from the Mediterranean Basin and from Sardinia respectively. Both of these last two are found with &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; and &quot;Cistus&quot; trees, and it is unclear whether they are native or introduced from Australia.

&quot;Amanitaceae.org&quot; lists four varieties , but says that they will be segregated into their own taxa &quot;in the near future&quot;. They are:

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;A. muscaria&quot; is a cosmopolitan mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America. A recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the Siberian–Beringian region in the Tertiary period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America. The season for fruiting varies in different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and early winter on the Pacific coast. This species is often found in similar locations to &quot;Boletus edulis&quot;, and may appear in fairy rings. Conveyed with pine seedlings, it has been widely transported into the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, where it can be found in the Brazilian states of Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul.
Ectomycorrhizal, &quot;A. muscaria&quot; forms symbiotic relationships with many trees, including pine, oak, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar. Commonly seen under introduced trees, &quot;A. muscaria&quot; is the fungal equivalent of a weed in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;). The species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, where it may be displacing the native species. It appears to be spreading northwards, with recent reports placing it near Port Macquarie on the New South Wales north coast. It was recorded under silver birch (&quot;Betula pendula&quot;) in Manjimup, Western Australia in 2010. Although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in Australia, it has been recorded associating with them in Portugal. Commonly found throughout the great Southern region of western Australia, it is regularly found growing on &quot;Pinus radiata&quot;.

==Toxicity==

&quot;A. muscaria&quot; poisoning has occurred in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience, or who confused it with an edible species.

&quot;A. muscaria&quot; contains several biologically active agents, at least one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with a small amount likely converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6 mg muscimol or 30 to 60 mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;. The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings.

Deaths from &quot;A. muscaria&quot; have been reported in historical journal articles and newspaper reports, but with modern medical treatment, fatal poisoning from ingesting this mushroom is extremely rare. Many books list &quot;A. muscaria&quot; as deadly, but according to David Arora, this is an error that implies the mushroom is far more toxic than it is. Furthermore, The North American Mycological Association has stated that there were &quot;no reliably documented cases of death from toxins in these mushrooms in the past 100 years&quot;.

The active constituents of this species are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies &quot;A. muscaria&quot;. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol. According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible. Patrick Harding describes the Sami custom of processing the fly agaric through reindeer.

===Pharmacology===
Muscarine, discovered in 1869, was long thought to be the active hallucinogenic agent in &quot;A. muscaria&quot;. Muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as &quot;Inosperma erubescens&quot;, the small white &quot;Clitocybe&quot; species &quot;C. dealbata&quot; and &quot;C. rivulosa&quot;. The level of muscarine in &quot;A. muscaria&quot; is too low to play a role in the symptoms of poisoning.

The major toxins involved in &quot;A. muscaria&quot; poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) and the related amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol is the product of the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating &quot;A. muscaria&quot;, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.

Ibotenic acid and muscimol are structurally related to each other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication.

Muscazone is another compound that has more recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It is a product of the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultraviolet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.

===Symptoms===
Fly agarics are best known for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount ingested per body weight, effects can range from mild nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium (like with tetanus.)

In cases of serious poisoning the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by &quot;Datura stramonium&quot;), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of central nervous system depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In the majority of cases recovery is complete within 12 to 24 hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.

===Treatment===
Medical attention should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. If the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, activated charcoal is given. Gastric lavage can be considered if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion. Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended in any poisoning situation.

There is no antidote, and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication. Though sometimes referred to as a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from &quot;A. muscaria&quot; and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.

== Uses ==

===Psychoactive===
The wide range of psychoactive effects have been variously described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, or deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur; the latter two effects may occur either simultaneously or alternatingly, as part of Alice in Wonderland syndrome, collectively known as dysmetropsia, along with related distortions pelopsia and teleopsia. Some users report lucid dreaming under the influence of its hypnotic effects. Unlike &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;, &quot;A. muscaria&quot; cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal &quot;A. muscaria&quot; began increasing.

Marija Gimbutas reported to R. Gordon Wasson that in remote areas of Lithuania, &quot;A. muscaria&quot; has been consumed at wedding feasts, in which mushrooms were mixed with vodka. She also reported that the Lithuanians used to export &quot;A. muscaria&quot; to the Sami in the Far North for use in shamanic rituals. The Lithuanian festivities are the only report that Wasson received of ingestion of fly agaric for religious use in Eastern Europe.

==== Siberia ====

&quot;A. muscaria&quot; was widely used as an entheogen by many of the indigenous peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; was not practised by these peoples. In western Siberia, the use of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, &quot;A. muscaria&quot; was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the &quot;A. muscaria&quot; mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.

The Koryak of eastern Siberia have a story about the fly agaric (&quot;wapaq&quot;) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity &quot;Vahiyinin&quot; (&quot;Existence&quot;) spat onto earth, and his spittle became the &quot;wapaq&quot;, and his saliva becomes the warts. After experiencing the power of the &quot;wapaq&quot;, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms. It was reported that the local reindeer would often follow an individual intoxicated by the muscimol mushroom, and if said individual were to urinate in snow the reindeer would become similarly intoxicated and the Koryak people&#x27;s would use the drunken state of the reindeer to more easily rope and hunt them.

==== Recent rise in popularity ====

As a result of a lack of regulation, the use of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; as a popular legal alternative to hallucinogens has grown exponentially in recent years. In 2024, Google searches for Amanita muscaria rose nearly 200% from the previous year, a trend that an article published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine correlated with the sudden commercialization of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; products on the internet.

While Amanita mushrooms are unscheduled in the United States, the sale of Amanita products exists in a legal gray area as they are listed as a poison by the FDA. Amanita mushrooms and muscimol are not approved as an ingredient in food or dietary supplements, with some drawing comparisons to the controversial legal status of hemp-derived cannabinoids.

A recent outbreak of poisonings and at least one death associated with products containing &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; extracts has sparked debates regarding the regulatory status of Amanita mushrooms and their psychoactive constituents, prompting an FDA ban of their use in food products in December 2024. These products often use misleading advertising, such as erroneous comparisons to Psilocybin mushrooms or simply not disclosing the inclusion of Amanita mushrooms on the packaging.

==== Other reports and theories ====
The Finnish historian T. I. Itkonen mentions that &quot;A. muscaria&quot; was once used among the Sámi peoples. Sorcerers in Inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots. In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and Hartmut Geerken published an article in which they claimed to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a Parachi-speaking group in Afghanistan. There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa ethnobotanist Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her people, where it was known as (an abbreviation of the name (= &quot;red-top mushroom&quot;). This information was enthusiastically received by Wasson, although evidence from other sources was lacking. There is also one account of a Euro-American who claims to have been initiated into traditional Tlicho use of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;. 

Mycophilosopher Martijn Benders has proposed a novel evolutionary theory involving &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;. In his book &quot;Amanita Muscaria – the Book of the Empress&quot;, Benders argues that a precursor of ibotenic acid, a compound found in the mushroom, was present in ancient seaweed and played a significant role in the evolution of life. According to this hypothesis, the compound influenced the twitching movements of early aquatic organisms, leading to the development of behaviors such as jumping onto land—a crucial step in the evolution of terrestrial species.

The flying reindeer of Santa Claus, who is called Joulupukki in Finland, could symbolize the use of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; by Sámi shamans. However, Sámi scholars and the Sámi peoples themselves refute any connection between Santa Claus and Sámi history or culture.&quot;The story of Santa emerging from a Sámi shamanic tradition has a critical number of flaws,&quot; asserts Tim Frandy, assistant professor of Nordic Studies at the University of British Columbia and a member of the Sámi descendent community in North America. &quot;The theory has been widely criticized by Sámi people as a stereotypical and problematic romanticized misreading of actual Sámi culture.&quot;
===== Vikings =====
The notion that Vikings used &quot;A. muscaria&quot; to produce their berserker rages was first suggested by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784. Ödmann based his theories on reports about the use of fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people. It is possible that it could make a person angry, or cause them to be &quot;very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright&quot;. Comparative analysis of symptoms have, however, since shown &quot;Hyoscyamus niger&quot; to be a better fit to the state that characterises the berserker rage.

===== Soma =====
In 1968, R. Gordon Wasson proposed that &quot;A. muscaria&quot; was the &quot;soma&quot; talked about in the Rigveda of India, a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time. He noted that descriptions of &quot;Soma&quot; omitted any description of roots, stems or seeds, which suggested a mushroom, and used the adjective &quot;hári&quot; &quot;dazzling&quot; or &quot;flaming&quot; which the author interprets as meaning red. One line described men urinating &quot;Soma&quot;; this recalled the practice of recycling urine in Siberia. Soma is mentioned as coming &quot;from the mountains&quot;, which Wasson interpreted as the mushroom having been brought in with the Aryan migrants from the north. Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed, using as a source the &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;.
In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson&#x27;s theory and noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma. In his 1976 survey, &quot;Hallucinogens and Culture&quot;, anthropologist Peter T. Furst evaluated the evidence for and against the identification of the fly agaric mushroom as the Vedic Soma, concluding cautiously in its favour. Kevin Feeney and Trent Austin compared the references in the Vedas with the filtering mechanisms in the preparation of Amanita muscaria and published findings supporting the proposal that fly-agaric mushrooms could be a likely candidate for the sacrament. Other proposed candidates include &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;, &quot;Peganum harmala&quot;, and &quot;Ephedra.&quot;

===== Christianity =====

Philologist, archaeologist, and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar John Marco Allegro postulated that early Christian theology was derived from a fertility cult revolving around the entheogenic consumption of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; in his 1970 book &quot;The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross.&quot; This theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of ethnomycology. The book was widely criticized by academics and theologians, including Sir Godfrey Driver, emeritus Professor of Semitic Philology at Oxford University and Henry Chadwick, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Christian author John C. King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro&#x27;s theory in the 1970 book &quot;A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth&quot;; he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the Middle East, even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory were true, the use of the mushroom must have been &quot;the best kept secret in the world&quot; as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.

=== Fly trap ===
&quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; is traditionally used for catching flies possibly due to its content of ibotenic acid and muscimol, which lead to its common name &quot;fly agaric&quot;. Recently, an analysis of nine different methods for preparing &quot;A. muscaria&quot; for catching flies in Slovenia have shown that the release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.

=== Culinary ===
The toxins in &quot;A. muscaria&quot; are water-soluble: parboiling &quot;A. muscaria&quot; fruit bodies can detoxify them and render them edible, although consumption of the mushroom as a food has never been widespread. The consumption of detoxified &quot;A. muscaria&quot; has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must also be detoxified before consumption.

Use of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak. It is also consumed as a food in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.

A 2008 paper by food historian William Rubel and mycologist David Arora gives a history of consumption of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; be described in field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of cultural bias, as several other popular edible species, notably morels, are also toxic unless properly cooked.

==In culture==
The red-and-white spotted toadstool is a common image in many aspects of popular culture. Garden ornaments and children&#x27;s picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show fly agarics used as seats, or homes. Fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance, albeit in a subtle manner. For instance, in Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, the mushroom can be seen on the left-hand panel of the work. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings. Two of the most famous uses of the mushroom are in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise (specifically two of the Super Mushroom power-up items and the platforms in several stages which are based on a fly agaric), and the dancing mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

An account of the journeys of Philip von Strahlenberg to Siberia and his descriptions of the use of the &quot;mukhomor&quot; there was published in English in 1736. The drinking of urine of those who had consumed the mushroom was commented on by Anglo-Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith in his widely read 1762 novel, &quot;Citizen of the World&quot;. The mushroom had been identified as the fly agaric by this time. Other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus, including naturalist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his books &quot;The Seven Sisters of Sleep&quot; and &quot;A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi&quot;. This observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the 1865 popular story &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. A hallucinogenic &quot;scarlet toadstool&quot; from Lappland is featured as a plot element in Charles Kingsley&#x27;s 1866 novel &quot;Hereward the Wake&quot; based on the medieval figure of the same name. Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; describes the fungus as a &quot;relative of the poisonous Destroying angel&quot; and presents a detailed description of a character preparing a cookie bake mixture from harvested &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;. Fly agaric shamanism—in the context of a surviving Dionysian cult in the Peak District—is also explored in the 2003 novel &quot;Thursbitch&quot; by Alan Garner.

<text>The [[Canada|Canadian]] Foundation for [[Climate]] and [[Earth&#x27;s atmosphere|Atmospheric]] [[Science]]s (CFCAS) was Canada&#x27;s main funding body for university-based research on climate, atmospheric, and related oceanic work. It is now the Canadian Climate Forum. As an autonomous, charitable foundation established in 2000, CFCAS funded research that improved the scientific understanding of processes and predictions, provided relevant science to policy makers, and improved understanding of the ways in which these challenges affect human health and the natural environment in addition to strengthening Canada&#x27;s scientific capacity. Its chair is Gordon McBean.

CFCAS fosters partnerships in support of innovation, investment, policy, skills development, and service delivery. It funds the generation of new knowledge that is essential to the competitiveness of industries and to the health and safety of Canadians. The foundation has invested over $117 million in university-based research related to climate and atmospheric sciences, in 24 collaborative networks, two major initiatives, and 158 projects. Several of the networks are linked to international research programs; all involved multiple partners. Complementary (leveraged) support for networks has doubled the resources available to them. The Foundation has also hosted or co-hosted a number of workshops and symposia on topics such as extreme weather and Arctic climate, and provides support to international project offices.

<doc id="59391" wikidata="Q1136781" url="?curid=59391" title="Morphing">
<text>Morphing is a special effect in motion pictures and animations that changes (or morphs) one image or shape into another through a seamless transition. Traditionally such a depiction would be achieved through dissolving techniques on film. Since the early 1990s, this has been replaced by computer software to create more realistic transitions. A similar method is applied to audio recordings, for example, by changing voices or vocal lines.

==Early transformation techniques==
Long before digital morphing, several techniques were used for similar image transformations. Some of those techniques are closer to a matched dissolve - a gradual change between two pictures without warping the shapes in the images - while others did change the shapes in between the start and end phases of the transformation.

===Tabula scalata===
Known since at least the end of the 16th century, Tabula scalata is a type of painting with two images divided over a corrugated surface. Each image is only correctly visible from a certain angle. If the pictures are matched properly, a primitive type of morphing effect occurs when changing from one viewing angle to the other.

===Mechanical transformations===
Around 1790 French shadow play showman François Dominique Séraphin used a metal shadow figure with jointed parts to have the face of a young woman changing into that of a witch.

Some 19th century mechanical magic lantern slides produced changes to the appearance of figures. For instance a nose could grow to enormous size, simply by slowly sliding away a piece of glass with black paint that masked part of another glass plate with the picture.

===Matched dissolves===
In the first half of the 19th century &quot;dissolving views&quot; were a popular type of magic lantern show, mostly showing landscapes gradually dissolving from a day to night version or from summer to winter. Other uses are known, for instance Henry Langdon Childe showed groves transforming into cathedrals.

The 1910 short film &quot;Narren-grappen&quot; shows a dissolve transformation of the clothing of a female character.

Maurice Tourneur&#x27;s 1915 film Alias Jimmy Valentine featured a subtle dissolve transformation of the main character from respected citizen Lee Randall into his criminal alter ego Jimmy Valentine.

&quot;The Peter Tchaikovsky Story&quot; in a 1959 TV-series episode of &quot;Disneyland&quot; features a swan automaton transforming into a real ballet dancer.

In 1985, Godley &amp; Creme created a &quot;morph&quot; effect using analogue cross-fades on parts of different faces in the video for &quot;Cry&quot;.

===Animation===
In animation, the morphing effect was created long before the introduction of cinema. A phenakistiscope designed by its inventor Joseph Plateau was printed around 1835 and shows the head of a woman changing into a witch and then into a monster.

Émile Cohl&#x27;s 1908 animated film &quot;Fantasmagorie&quot; featured much morphing of characters and objects drawn in simple outlines.

==Digital morphing==

In the early 1990s, computer techniques capable of more convincing results saw increasing use. These involved distorting one image at the same time that it faded into another through marking corresponding points and vectors on the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; images used in the morph. For example, one would morph one face into another by marking key points on the first face, such as the contour of the nose or location of an eye, and mark where these same points existed on the second face. The computer would then distort the first face to have the shape of the second face at the same time that it faded the two faces. To compute the transformation of image coordinates required for the distortion, the algorithm of Beier and Neely can be used.

===Early examples===
In or before 1986, computer graphics company Omnibus created a digital animation for a Tide commercial with a Tide detergent bottle smoothly morphing into the shape of the United States. The effect was programmed by Bob Hoffman. Omnibus re-used the technique in the movie &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot; (1986). It featured scenes with a computer generated spaceship that appeared to change shape. The plaster cast of a model of the spaceship was scanned and digitally modified with techniques that included a reflection mapping technique that was also developed by programmer Bob Hoffman.

The 1986 movie &quot;The Golden Child&quot; implemented early digital morphing effects from animal to human and back.

&quot;Willow&quot; (1988) featured a more detailed digital morphing sequence with a person changing into different animals. A similar process was used a year later in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; to create Walter Donovan&#x27;s gruesome demise. Both effects were created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, using software developed by Tom Brigham and Doug Smythe (AMPAS).

In 1991, morphing appeared notably in the Michael Jackson music video &quot;Black or White&quot; and in the movies &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. The first application for personal computers to offer morphing was Gryphon Software Morph on the Macintosh. Other early morphing systems included ImageMaster, MorphPlus and CineMorph, all of which premiered for the Amiga in 1992. Other programs became widely available within a year, and for a time the effect became common to the point of cliché. For high-end use, Elastic Reality (based on MorphPlus) saw its first feature film use in &quot;In The Line of Fire&quot; (1993) and was used in &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; (work performed by the Post Group). At VisionArt Ted Fay used Elastic Reality to morph Odo for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. The Snoop Dogg music video &quot;Who Am I? (What&#x27;s My Name?)&quot;, where Snoop Dogg and the others morph into dogs. Elastic Reality was later purchased by Avid, having already become the de facto system of choice, used in many hundreds of films. The technology behind Elastic Reality earned two Academy Awards in 1996 for Scientific and Technical Achievement going to Garth Dickie and Perry Kivolowitz. The effect is technically called a &quot;spatially warped cross-dissolve&quot;. The first social network designed for user-generated morph examples to be posted online was Galleries by Morpheus.

In Taiwan, Aderans, a hair loss solutions provider, did a TV commercial featuring a morphing sequence in which people with lush, thick hair morph into one another, reminiscent of the end sequence of the &quot;Black or White&quot; video.

===Present use===
Morphing algorithms continue to advance and programs can automatically morph images that correspond closely enough with relatively little instruction from the user. This has led to the use of morphing techniques to create convincing slow-motion effects where none existed in the original film or video footage by morphing between each individual frame using optical flow technology. Morphing has also appeared as a transition technique between one scene and another in television shows, even if the contents of the two images are entirely unrelated. The algorithm in this case attempts to find corresponding points between the images and distort one into the other as they crossfade.

While perhaps less obvious than in the past, morphing is used heavily today. Whereas the effect was initially a novelty, today, morphing effects are most often designed to be seamless and invisible to the eye.

A particular use for morphing effects is modern digital font design. Using morphing technology, called interpolation or multiple master tech, a designer can create an intermediate between two styles, for example generating a semibold font by compromising between a bold and regular style, or extend a trend to create an ultra-light or ultra-bold. The technique is commonly used by font design studios.

<text>Surface anatomy (also called superficial anatomy and visual anatomy) is the study of the external features of the body of an animal. In birds, this is termed &quot;topography&quot;. Surface anatomy deals with anatomical features that can be studied by sight, without dissection. As such, it is a branch of gross anatomy, along with endoscopic and radiological anatomy. Surface anatomy is a descriptive science. In particular, in the case of human surface anatomy, these are the form and proportions of the human body and the surface landmarks which correspond to deeper structures hidden from view, both in static pose and in motion.

In addition, the science of surface anatomy includes the theories and systems of body proportions and related artistic canons. The study of surface anatomy is the basis for depicting the human body in classical art.

Some pseudo-sciences such as physiognomy, phrenology and palmistry rely on surface anatomy.

==Human surface anatomy==

===Surface anatomy of the thorax===
Knowledge of the surface anatomy of the thorax (chest) is particularly important because it is one of the areas most frequently subjected to physical examination, like auscultation and percussion. In cardiology, Erb&#x27;s point refers to the third intercostal space on the left sternal border where S2 heart sound is best auscultated. Some sources include the fourth left interspace.

Human female breasts are located on the chest wall, most frequently between the second and sixth rib.
===Anatomical landmarks===
# On the trunk of the body in the thoracic area, the shoulder in general is the acromial, while the curve of the shoulder is the deltoid. 
# The back as a general area is the dorsum or dorsal area, and the lower back as the limbus or lumbar region. 
# The shoulderblades are the scapular area and the breastbone is the sternal region. 
# The abdominal area is the region between the chest and the pelvis. 
# The breast is called the mamma or mammary, the armpit as the axilla and axillary, and the navel as the umbilicus and umbilical. 
# The pelvis is the lower torso, between the abdomen and the thighs. 
# The groin, where the thigh joins the trunk, are the inguen and inguinal area.
# The entire arm is referred to as the brachium and brachial, the front of the elbow as the antecubitis and antecubital, the back of the elbow as the olecranon or olecranal, the forearm as the antebrachium and antebrachial, the wrist as the carpus and carpal area, the hand as the manus and manual, the palm as the palma and palmar, the thumb as the pollex, and the fingers as the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal. 
# The buttocks are the gluteus or gluteal region and the pubic area is the pubis.
# Anatomists divide the lower limb into the thigh (the part of the limb between the hip and the knee) and the leg (which refers only to the area of the limb between the knee and the ankle). 
# The thigh is the femur and the femoral region. 
# The kneecap is the patella and patellar while the back of the knee is the popliteus and popliteal area. 
# The leg (between the knee and the ankle) is the crus and crural area, the lateral aspect of the leg is the area, and the calf is the sura and sural region. 
# The ankle is the tarsus and tarsal, and the heel is the calcaneus or calcaneal. The foot is the pes and pedal region, and the sole of the foot the planta and plantar. 
# As with the fingers, the toes are also called the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal area. 
# The big toe is referred to as the hallux.

==List of features==

<text>The Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC; ) is a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada, which primarily provides public meteorological information and weather forecasts and warnings of severe weather and other environmental hazards. MSC also monitors and conducts research on the climate, atmospheric science, air quality, water quantities, ice and other environmental issues. MSC operates a network of radio stations throughout Canada transmitting weather and environmental information 24 hours a day called Weatheradio Canada.

==History==
===Private Observations===

Prior to 1840, meteorological observations in Canada were made by private individuals, other entities (like HBC), and explorers, but this information was not provided to the general public.

===Her Majesty&#x27;s Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory===
In 1840, British officials (British Ordnance Department) and the Royal Society established an observatory in Toronto, Canada West, one of a few across the British Empire and likely modeled after the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.

===Meteorological Service of the Dominion===
The Toronto observatory ended in 1853, but the colonial government of the province of Canada took over the service and continued collecting climate data. On May 1, 1871, the new Dominion of Canada established the Meteorological Service of Canada by providing a $5000 grant to Professor G. T. Kingston of the University of Toronto to establish a network of weather observations. This information was collected and made available to the public from 1877 onwards. The MSC was then assigned under the Department of Marine and Fisheries.

===Meteorological Division of the Air Services Branch===

From 1936 to 1946 the services assigned under the Department of Transport as the &quot;Meteorological Division of the Air Services Branch&quot;&#x27; and as the &quot;Meteorological Branch&quot; from 1956.

In 1939, the &quot;Meteorological Division, Air Services Branch&quot; was expanding rapidly to serve commercial aviation. In September 1939 the full-time staff of the Meteorological Division based in Toronto numbered 213, of which 51 were meteorologists and 57 were meteorological observers.

===Atmospheric Environment Service and Meteorological Service of Canada===

In 1971 the Canadian Meteorological Service was established under the Department of Environment (Environment Canada) in 1971. The AES was renamed later as the Meteorological Service of Canada.

== Organization ==
There are currently six public weather forecast offices:

* Pacific and Yukon Storm Prediction Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia
* Prairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Centre, split between an office in Edmonton, Alberta and Winnipeg, Manitoba
* Ontario Storm Prediction Centre (Toronto)
* Quebec Storm Prediction Centre (Montreal, Quebec)
* Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre (Dartmouth, Nova Scotia). The Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre also houses the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
* Newfoundland and Labrador Weather Office (Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador)

There are two centres dedicated to aviation weather forecasting: Canadian Meteorological Aviation Centre-East, located in Montreal, and Canadian Meteorological Aviation Centre-West, located in Edmonton.

MSC also operates the Canadian Center for Meteorological and Environmental Prediction, which is tasked with providing forecast guidance, and the Canadian Ice Service, which provides ice observations and forecasts for mariners. In support of Canada&#x27;s military, some MSC meteorologists are seconded to the Department of National Defence.

The Meteorological Service of Canada was ISO9001:2000 Certified for their Hydrometric Monitoring Program.

<text>The Haijin () or sea ban were a series of related isolationist policies in China restricting private maritime trading and coastal settlement during most of the Ming dynasty and early Qing dynasty.

The policy introduced by the Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang significantly hampered the growth of China&#x27;s domestic trade, although the Ming was not able to enforce the policy in full despite official proclamations, and trade continued in forms such as smuggling until the late Ming government opened the port of Yuegang for trade. Initially imposed to deal with Japanese piracy amid the neutralization of Yuan dynasty partisans, the sea ban was completely counterproductive: by the 16th century, piracy and smuggling were endemic and mostly consisted of Chinese who had been dispossessed by the policy. China&#x27;s foreign trade was limited to irregular and expensive tribute missions, and the military pressure from the Mongols after the disastrous Battle of Tumu led to the scrapping of Zheng He&#x27;s fleets. Piracy dropped to negligible levels only upon the end of the policy in 1567.

The early Qing dynasty&#x27;s anti-insurgent &quot;Great Clearance&quot; (1661–1683) also caused considerable devastating effects on communities along the coast, until the Qing seized control of Taiwan and opened coastal ports to foreign trade. Separately, strict travel restrictions were temporarily implemented during the brief trade ban of the &quot;Southern Sea&quot; between 1717 and 1727. Later, the need to control trade gave birth to the Canton System of the Thirteen Factories (1757–1842), where trade ports was heavily restricted.

Similar sea bans occurred in other East Asian countries, such as the &quot;Sakoku&quot; policy in Edo period Japan by the Tokugawa shogunate; or the isolationist policies of Joseon Korea, before they were forced to end their isolation militarily in 1853 and 1876 respectively.

==Ming dynasty==
===Background===
The 14th century was a time of chaos throughout East Asia. The second bubonic plague pandemic began in Mongolia around 1330 and may have killed the majority of the population in Hebei and Shanxi and millions elsewhere. Another epidemic raged for three years from 1351 to 1354. Existing revolts over the government salt monopoly and severe floods along the Yellow River provoked the Red Turban Rebellion. The declaration of the Ming in 1368 did not end its wars with Mongol remnants under Toghon Temür in the north and under the Prince of Liang in the south. King Gongmin of Korea had begun freeing himself from the Mongols as well, retaking his country&#x27;s northern provinces, when a Red Turban invasion devastated the areas and laid waste to Pyongyang. In Japan, Emperor Daigo II&#x27;s Kenmu Restoration succeeded in overthrowing the Kamakura shogunate but ultimately simply replaced them with the weaker Ashikaga.

The loose control over Japan&#x27;s periphery led to pirates setting up bases on the realm&#x27;s outlying islands, particularly Tsushima, Iki, and the Gotōs. These wokou (&quot;Japanese pirates&quot;) raided Japan as well as Korea and China.

As a rebel leader, Zhu Yuanzhang promoted foreign trade as a source of revenue. As the Hongwu Emperor, first of the Ming dynasty, however, he issued the first sea ban in 1371. All foreign trade was to be conducted by official tribute missions, handled by representatives of the Ming Empire and its &quot;vassal&quot; states. Private foreign trade was made punishable by death, with the offender&#x27;s family and neighbors exiled from their homes. A few years later, in 1384, the Maritime Trade Intendancies (&quot;Shibo Tiju Si&quot;) at Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Quanzhou were shuttered. Ships, docks, and shipyards were destroyed and ports sabotaged with rocks and pine stakes. Although the policy is now associated with imperial China generally, it was then at odds with Chinese tradition, which had pursued foreign trade as a source of revenue and become particularly important under the Tang, Song, and Yuan.

The treasure voyages of Zheng He were partly intended to monopolise overseas trade under the government. They were discontinued due to a rise in Mongol assertiveness after the Emperor&#x27;s capture at the Battle of Tumu in 1449. The large scale of private overseas trade had caused price competition for the Ming government&#x27;s purchases, such as warhorses for the northern frontier, and funds had to be reallocated. However, after the end of the treasure voyages, Chinese trade in Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean continued. Private, including unauthorised, Chinese trade in Southeast Asia expanded rapidly in the second half of the Ming dynasty.

A 1613 edict prohibited maritime trade between the lands north and south of the Yangtze River, attempting to put a stop to captains claiming to be heading to Jiangsu and then diverting to Japan.

===Rationale===
Although the policy has generally been ascribed to national defense against the pirates, it was so obviously counterproductive and yet carried on for so long that other explanations have been offered. The initial conception seems to have been to use the Japanese need for Chinese goods to force them to terms. The Hongwu emperor seemed to indicate that the policy was designed to prevent foreign nations from collaborating with his subjects to challenge his rule; for instance, Srivijaya was banned from trading as the emperor suspected them of spying. The usage of trade was also a powerful tool to entice foreign governments to abide by the tributary system and pressure uncooperative leaders. Parallels with Song and Yuan measures restricting outflows of bullion have led some to argue that it was intended to support the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s printing of fiat currency, whose use was continued by his successors as late as 1450. (By 1425, rampant counterfeiting and hyperinflation meant people were already trading at about 0.014% of their original value.) Others assert that it was a side effect of a desire to elevate Confucian humaneness (, &quot;ren&quot;) and eliminate greed from the realm&#x27;s foreign relations or a ploy to weaken the realm&#x27;s southern subjects to the benefit of the central government. Nonetheless, it may have been the case that the Hongwu Emperor prioritized protecting his state against the Northern Yuan remnants, leaving the policy and its local enforcers as the most he could accomplish and his mention of them in his &quot;Ancestral Injunctions&quot; as responsible for their continuation.

===Effects===
The policy offered too little—decennial tribute missions comprising only two ships—as a reward for good behavior and enticement for Japanese authorities to root out their smugglers and pirates. The Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s message to the Japanese that his army would &quot;capture and exterminate your bandits, head straight for your country, and put your king in bonds&quot; received the Ashikaga shogun&#x27;s reply that &quot;your great empire may be able to invade Japan but our small state is not short of a strategy to defend ourselves&quot;.

Although the sea ban left the Ming army free to extirpate the remaining Yuan loyalists and secure China&#x27;s borders, it tied up local resources. 74 coastal garrisons were established from Guangzhou in Guangdong to Shandong; under the Yongle Emperor, these outposts were notionally manned by 110,000 subjects. The loss of income from taxes on trade contributed to chronic funding difficulties throughout the Ming, particularly for Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. By impoverishing and provoking both coastal Chinese and Japanese against the regime, it increased the problem it was purporting to solve. The initial wave of Japanese pirates had been independently dealt with by Chŏng Mong-ju and Imagawa Sadayo, who returned their booty and slaves to Korea; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu delivered 20 more to China in 1405, which boiled them alive in a cauldron in Ningbo. However, the raids on China continued, most grievously under the Jiajing Emperor. By the 16th century, the &quot;Japanese&quot;, &quot;dwarf&quot;, and &quot;eastern barbarian&quot; pirates of the Jiajing wokou raids were mostly non-Japanese.

Nonetheless, because the sea ban was added by the Hongwu Emperor to his &quot;Ancestral Injunctions&quot;, it continued to be broadly kept through most of the rest of his dynasty. For the next two centuries, the rich farmland of the south and the military theaters of the north were linked almost solely by the Jinghang Canal. Bribery and disinterest occasionally permitted more leeway, as when the Portuguese began trading at Guangzhou (1517), Shuangyu (&quot;Liampo&quot;), and Quanzhou (&quot;Chincheu&quot;), but crackdowns also occurred, as with the expulsion of the Portuguese in the 1520s, on the islands off Ningbo and Zhangzhou in 1547, or at Yuegang in 1549. The Portuguese were permitted to settle at Macao in 1557, but only after several years of helping the Chinese suppress piracy.

The sea ban was largely unenforceable from its earliest years, and no effective enforcement was ever implemented. Local authorities themselves were frequently involved in the illicit trade, and usually ignored edicts to restrict trade. Military officers brokered trade deals and the wealthy families in the coastal settlements depended on its income. Ordinary workers found employment in trade-related industries. Many of the official posts to enforce trade regulations were left vacant and the Maritime Trading Intendancies were abolished. The court generally ignored the issue of overseas trade. In the 1520s the emperor rejected all attempts to halt the trade as these came from officials who had opposed the emperor&#x27;s policy of rituals, and very little trade took place under governmental channels instead of illicit means. The Grand secretary of the court in the 1530s was from coastal Zhejiang province, and he proceeded to block any attempt to enforce the sea ban. The most significant attempt to crush out the illicit trade was made by Zhu Wan, an official appointed by the court in the 1540s, but just as he was making headway in wiping out the smugglers he was removed by the court on accusations of unauthorised killings.

Piracy dropped to negligible levels only after the general abolition of the policy in 1567 upon the ascension of the Longqing Emperor and at the urging of the governor of Fujian Tu Zemin. Chinese merchants for both maritime and overland trade could apply for permits to engage in all foreign trade except with Japan (although some still traded there anyway, and Japanese traders also set themselves up in Southeast Asia to trade with incoming Chinese) or involving weapons or other contraband goods; these included iron, sulfur, and copper. The number of foreign traders was capped by a license and quota system; no trading could take them away from China for longer than a year. Maritime trade intendancies were reëstablished at Guangzhou and Ningbo in 1599, and Chinese merchants turned Yuegang (modern Haicheng, Fujian) into a thriving port. The end of the sea ban did not mark an imperial change of heart, however, so much as a recognition that the weakness of the later Ming state made it impossible to continue the prohibition. The state continued to attempt to regulate trade as heavily as it could, and foreigners were restricted to doing business through approved agents, with prohibitions against any direct business with ordinary Chinese. Accommodations could be made, but were slow in coming: the merchants of Yuegang were trading heavily with the Spanish within a year of Maynila&#x27;s 1570 conquest by Martín de Goiti but it wasn&#x27;t until 1589 that the throne approved the city&#x27;s requests for more merchant licenses to expand the trade. Fu Yuanchu&#x27;s 1639 memorial to the throne made the case that trade between Fujian and Dutch Formosa had made the ban entirely unworkable.

The lifting of the sea ban coincided with the arrival of the first Spanish galleons from the Americas, creating a global trade link that would not be interrupted until the following century.

=== China in the global trading system ===

China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade. Trade with Japan continued unobstructed despite the embargo, through Chinese smugglers, Southeast Asian ports, or Portuguese. China was entirely integrated in the world trading system.

European nations had a great desire for Chinese goods such as silk and porcelain. The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit. Spaniards at the time of the Age of Exploration discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the Potosí silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Spanish American silver mines were the world&#x27;s cheapest sources of it, producing 40,000 tons of silver in 200 years. The ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China. From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80% of the world&#x27;s silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China. In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting silver heavily into China. Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east. Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. The city of Manila served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, India, Indonesia and China. However, there was a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well. 

Trade with Ming China via Manila served a major source of revenue for the Spanish Empire and as a fundamental source of income for Spanish colonists in the Philippine Islands. Until 1593, two or more ships would set sail annually from each port. The galleon trade was supplied by merchants largely from port areas of Fujian who traveled to Manila to sell the Spaniards spices, porcelain, ivory, lacquerware, processed silk cloth and other valuable commodities. Cargoes varied from one voyage to another but often included goods from all over Asia - jade, wax, gunpowder and silk from China; amber, cotton and rugs from India; spices from Indonesia and Malaysia; and a variety of goods from Japan, including fans, chests, screens and porcelain.

==Qing dynasty==
===Background===
As the Qing expanded south following their victory at Shanhai Pass, the Southern Ming were supported by the Zheng clan. Zheng Zhilong surrendered the passes through Zhejiang in exchange for a wealthy retirement, but his son Zheng Chenggong—better known by his Hokkien honorific Koxinga—continued to resist from Xiamen and then, after wresting its control from the Dutch, Taiwan. His dynasty then developed it as the independent state of Tungning, but were driven from their mainland bases in 1661.

===Policy===

The Qing regent Prince Rui resumed the sea ban in 1647, but it was not effective until a more severe order followed in 1661 upon the ascension of the Kangxi Emperor. In an evacuation as the &quot;Great Clearance&quot; or &quot;Frontier Shift&quot;, coastal residents of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and parts of Shandong were required to destroy their property and move inland (about ), with Qing soldiers erecting boundary markers and enforcing the death penalty on those beyond it. Ships were destroyed, and foreign trade was again limited to that passing through Macao. Checks and adjustments were made the following year, and the inhabitants of five counties—Panyu, Shunde, Xinhui, Dongguan, and Zhongshan—moved again the year after that. Following numerous high-level memorials, the evacuation was no longer enforced after 1669. In 1684, following the destruction of Tungning, other bans were lifted. The year after that, customs offices were established in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Songjiang to deal with foreign trade.

Repressive Qing policies such as the queue caused Chinese traders to emigrate in such large numbers, however, that the Kangxi Emperor began to fear the military implications. The immigrant community in Jakarta was estimated at 100,000 and rumors circulated that a Ming heir was living on Luzon. A ban on trade in the &quot;Southern Sea&quot; followed in 1717, with tighter port inspections and travel restrictions. Emigrants were ordered to return to China within the next three years upon penalty of death; those emigrating in future were to face the same punishment.

Legal trade in the South China Sea was resumed in 1727, but the East India Company&#x27;s discovery that the prices and duties at Ningbo were both much lower than those at Guangzhou prompted them to begin shifting their trade north from 1755 to 1757. The Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s attempt to discourage this through higher fees failed; in the winter of 1757, he declared that—effective the next year—Guangzhou (then romanized as &quot;Canton&quot;) was to be the only Chinese port permitted to foreign traders, beginning the Canton System, with its Cohong and Thirteen Factories. Chinese merchants trading with foreigners, on the other hand, were not affected by any of these regulations.

===Effects===
The initial Qing sea ban curtailed Koxinga&#x27;s influence on the Chinese mainland and ended with his state&#x27;s defeat, which brought Taiwan into the Qing Empire.

Nonetheless, it was quite harmful to the Chinese themselves, as documented in governors&#x27; and viceroys&#x27; memorials to the throne. Even before the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s restrictions, Jin Fu&#x27;s 1659 memorial to the throne argued that the ban on foreign trade was limiting China&#x27;s access to silver, harmfully restricting the money supply, and that lost trading opportunities cost Chinese merchants 7 or 8 million taels a year. The policies revived rebellions and piracy along the coast, while also providing a boon for black markets. The Great Clearance was completely disruptive to China&#x27;s southern coasts. Of the roughly 16,000 residents of Xin&#x27;an County (roughly modern Shenzhen and Hong Kong) who were driven inland in 1661, only 1,648 were recorded returning in 1669. Powerful typhoons that year and in 1671 further destroyed local communities and discouraged resettlement. When trade restrictions were released, Fujian and Guangdong saw enormous outflows of migrants. The conflicts between the former residents and the newcomers such as the Hakka provoked lingering feuds that erupted into full-scale war in the 1850s and 1860s and that fueled Guangdong&#x27;s piracy into the 20th century.

European countries&#x27; trade with China was so extensive that they were forced to risk silver deficits to supply merchants in Asia. As supplies of silver decreased in Europe, Europeans had less ability to purchase highly coveted Chinese goods. Merchants were no longer able to sustain the China trade through profits made by selling Chinese goods in the West and were forced to take bullion out of circulation in Europe to buy goods in China.

The restrictions imposed by the Qianlong Emperor that established the Canton System were highly lucrative for Guangzhou&#x27;s Cohong—the merchant Howqua became one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest individuals—and normalized Guangzhou&#x27;s tax base and inflow of foreign silver. Under the canton system, the Qianlong Emperor restricted trade to only licensed Chinese merchants, while the British government on their part issued a monopoly charter for trade only to the British East India Company. This arrangement was not challenged until the 19th century when the idea of free trade was popularised in the West. The Canton system did not completely affect Chinese trade with the rest of the world as Chinese merchants, with their large three-masted ocean junks, were heavily involved in global trade. By sailing to and from Siam, Indonesia and Philippines, they were major facilitators of the global trading system; the era was even described by Carl Trocki as a &quot;Chinese century&quot; of global commerce. Chinese merchants could also trade freely and legally with Westerners (Spanish and Portuguese) in Xiamen and Macao, or with any country when trade was conducted through ports outside China such as Manila and Batavia. By restricting imports mostly to bullion, however, it created strong pressure on the British—for whom tea had become the national drink over the course of the 17th century—to find any means possible to adjust the balance of trade. This turned out to be opium grown on plantations in India, which became so lucrative and important that the viceroy Lin Zexu&#x27;s vigorous enforcement of existing laws against the smuggling of opium prompted the First Opium War and the beginning of the unequal treaties that restricted Qing sovereignty in the 19th century. The 1842 Treaty of Nanking opened the ports of Xiamen (&quot;Amoy&quot;), Fuzhou (&quot;Fuchow&quot;), Ningbo (&quot;Ningpo&quot;), and Shanghai, but legal trade continued to be limited to specified ports to the end of the dynasty.
