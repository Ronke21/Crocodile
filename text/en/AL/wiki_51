<text>A kit car is an automobile available as a set of parts that a manufacturer sells and the buyer then assembles into a functioning car. Usually, many of the major mechanical systems such as the engine and transmission are sourced from donor vehicles or purchased new from other vendors. Kits vary in completeness, consisting of as little as a book of plans, or as much as a complete set with all components to assemble into a fully operational vehicle such as those from Caterham.

==Related terms==
A subset of the kit car, commonly referred to as a &quot;re-body&quot;, is when a commercially manufactured vehicle has a new (often fiberglass) body put on the running chassis. Most times, the existing drive gear and interior are retained. These kits require less technical knowledge from the builder. Because the chassis and mechanical systems were designed, built, and tested by a major automotive manufacturer, a re-body can lead to a much higher degree of safety and reliability.

The definition of a kit car usually indicates that a manufacturer constructs multiple kits of the same vehicle, each of which it then sells to a third party to build. A kit car should not be confused with 
*a &quot;hand built&quot; car or &quot;special&quot; car, which is typically modified or built from scratch by an individual for a specific purpose (such as hillclimbing, road or circuit racing, or record attempts). &quot;Rally specials&quot; and &quot;homologation specials&quot; have, especially since the Second World War, typically referred to special series-produced cars built by manufacturers.
*a &quot;component car&quot;, which is a self-assembly car in which 100% of the parts required to build the car are purchased from a single company. Component cars are distinguished from kit cars as all parts are quality controlled and designed to fit together perfectly. They can be built in significantly less time than a &quot;kit car&quot;. See also knock-down kit, a term usually applied to a similar but larger commercial exercise.

==History==

Kit cars have been around since the earliest days of the automobile. In England in 1896, Thomas Hyler-White developed a design for a car that could be assembled at home. Technical designs were published in a magazine called &quot;The English Mechanic&quot;. In the US, the Lad&#x27;s Car of 1912 could be bought for US$160 ($5,000 in 2023) fully assembled or US$140 ($4,400 in 2023) in kit form.

Kit cars became popular in the 1950s. Car production had increased considerably and with rust proofing in its infancy, many older vehicles were being sent to breaker yards as their bodywork was beyond economic repair. An industry grew up supplying new bodies and chassis to take the components from these cars and convert them into new vehicles, particularly into sports cars. Fiber-reinforced plastic was coming into general use and made limited-scale production of automobile body components much more economical. In the UK up to the mid-1970s, kit cars were sometimes normal production vehicles that were partially assembled. This avoided the imposition of a purchase tax, as the kits were assessed as components and not vehicles.

During the 1970s, many kits had bodies styled as sports cars that were designed to bolt directly to VW Beetle chassis. This was popular as the old body could be easily separated from the chassis, leaving virtually all mechanical components attached to the chassis. A fiber-reinforced plastic body from the kit supplier would then be fitted. This made the Beetle one of the most popular &quot;donor&quot; vehicles. Examples of this conversion include the Bradley GT, Sterling, and Sebring which were made by the thousands. Many are still around today. Volkswagen-based dune buggies also appeared in relatively large numbers in the 1960s and 1970s, usually based on a shortened floor pan.

Current kit cars are frequently replicas of well-known and often expensive classics. They are designed so that anyone with the right technical skills can build them at home to a standard where they can be driven on the public roads. These replicas are in general appearance like the original, but their bodies are often made of fiberglass mats soaked in polyester resin instead of the original sheet metal. Replicas of the AC Cobra and the Lotus Seven are particularly popular examples. The right to manufacture the Lotus 7 is owned by Caterham Cars, who bought the rights to the car from Lotus founder Colin Chapman in 1973. Caterham cars are component cars and are a continued development of Chapman&#x27;s design. All other Lotus Seven-style cars are replica kit cars costing significantly less than the Caterham without the residual value. These replica kit cars enable enthusiasts to possess a vehicle closely resembling a vehicle that they may not be able to afford due to scarcity, and at the same time take advantage of modern technology. The Sterling Nova kit originally produced in the UK was the most popular VW-based kits being produced worldwide. It was licensed under several different names with an estimated 10,000 sold.

A common concern about kit cars is that it appears to many to be technically impossible to assemble a car at home and license it for public roads, including meeting standards for the mandatory quality control (road worthiness test) that is required in most countries. For example, to obtain permission to use a kit car in Germany, every such vehicle with a speed over 6 km/h without a general operating license (ABE) or an EC type permission (EC-TG) has to undergo a technical inspection by an officially recognized expert. In the United Kingdom it is necessary to meet the requirements of the IVA (Individual vehicle Approval) regulations. In the United States SEMA has gone state by state to set up legal ways for states to register kit cars and speciality vehicles for inspection and plates.

A survey of nearly 600 kit car owners in the US, the UK and Germany, carried out by Dr. Ingo Stüben, showed that typically 100–1,500 hours are required to build a kit car, depending upon the model and the completeness of the kit. As the complexity of the kits offered continues to increase, build times have increased. Some accurate replica kits may take over 5,000 hours to complete.

Several sports car producers such as Lotus, Marcos, and TVR started as kit car makers.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand had a long history of small garages and vehicle enthusiasts modifying and creating sports and sports racing cars. In the early 1950s, with the advent of fibreglass bodied cars, a new opportunity arose for local companies associated with car enthusiasts to create car bodies. Among these early manufacturers was Weltex Plastics Limited of Christchurch, which imported a Microplas Mistral sports car mould and began making bodies and chassis in 1956. They were followed in 1958 by Frank Cantwell&#x27;s Puma and Bruce Goldwater&#x27;s Cougar. Also in New Zealand during this period, Ferris de Joux was constructing a variety of sports racers. De Joux is noted in particular for his Mini GT from the 1960s.

Ross Baker&#x27;s Heron Cars started in 1962 making racing cars and eventually began producing kit cars in 1980. Bill Ashton, formerly of Microplas and Weltex, joined with Ted George in the 1960s and made the Tiki. Three were known to have been made. Graham McRae with Steve Bond of Gemini Plastics imported a replica Le Mans M6B styled GT mould in 1968, The cars were made and sold by Dave Harrod and Steve Bond of Fibreglass Developments Ltd, Bunnythorpe as the Maram. McRae went on to make a Porsche Spyder replica in the 1990s.

A number of new companies entered the market in the 1980s – Almac 1985, Alternative Cars (1984), Cheetah (1986), Chevron (1984), Countess Mouldings (1988), Fraser (1988), Leitch (1986), and Saker (1989). Some recent ones are Baettie (1997), which became Redline in 2001 and moved to the United Kingdom in 2007 as Beattie Racing Limited, and McGregor (2001).

Two companies who specialise in making replicas of various models to order are Classic Car Developments (1992) and Tempero.

===Slovakia===

The K1-Attack Kit car is produced by Slovakian company K1 Styling &amp; Tuning. Their cars are customizable and have come in many different variations since 2001. K1 offers engines produced by Honda, Toyota, etc. in the 130HP to 800HP range. Due to its light weight it achieves the same power output–weight ratio as Lamborghini Gallardo, Audi R8, or Ferrari F430 even with a 280 hp engine. 

The (cheapest) complete kit costs around $15,000, and is based on the Honda Accord 4/5G F20/F22 (2.0L–2.2L) engine. A complete kit with Honda Civic Type-R 9-10G K20C1 achieves 320HP (at request, the engine can be tuned to 400–500HP). Many more engines, such as Honda K24, Toyota 3SGTE are available.

Customer projects have included engines such as the VW 1.9 TDI, VW 1.8T, (not specified) 2.0 Subaru engine, 2.5L V6 Ford, 3.0 V6 Jaguar, 3.0 I6 BMW, or 4.2L V8 from Audi R8.

Though based in Slovakia, the company markets itself as producing Czecho-Slovakian products.

The specialist car builder Hi-Tech Automotive does not venture to supply cars in kit form at all, but only builds fully-assembled &quot;turnkey-minus&quot; continuation series cars with chassis, bodywork and interior trim finished off, ready for engine installation. Almost all cars are exported, mostly to the United States as &quot;glider kits&quot;.

===Sweden===

Technically, kit cars are not allowed in Sweden, but provided that most of the components and material are sourced by the builder personally it is possible to register them as amateur built vehicles. Before the law requiring a mandatory crash test in 1970 there was a booming kit car industry in Sweden with most companies basing their kits on the VW Beetle chassis. By the time amateur-built vehicles were once again allowed in 1982, all kit car makers in Sweden were out of business.

The inspection (SVA equivalent) in Sweden is handled by the car builders&#x27; association SFRO who does two inspections: one when the car has reached the rolling chassis stage and the second when the car is finished. Amateur-built cars are currently limited to a power ratio of per 100 kg (182 hp/ton). Until 2003, the limit was per 100 kg, so for very light cars (like a Lotus 7 type car) it was a problem to find a suitable engine.

===United Kingdom===
Vehicle regulations in the UK allow the production of up to 200 vehicles a year without the extensive regulation and testing requirements applied to mass-market vehicles. This has led to an expanding industry of small producers capable of offering partial and complete kits, some for export, and finished vehicles for domestic use.

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) regulate kit cars in the UK, which helps to ensure that vehicles used on the road are safe and suitable for the purpose. The current test for this is Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA), which has replaced Single Vehicle Approval (SVA). When SVA was first introduced in 1998, many believed this would kill off the kit car market, but in reality it has made the kit car market stronger, as the vehicles produced now have to meet a minimum standard. IVA was introduced in summer 2009 and it is too early to tell what impact this will have on the industry.

A significant number of kit cars do not receive a &#x27;Q&#x27; registration plate, which signifies a vehicle of unknown or mixed age. All kit cars are subject to a Vehicle Identity Check, VIC, by the DVLA to determine the registration mark a kit car is assigned. This will be either, a new, current year, registration; an &#x27;age-related&#x27; registration; or a &#x27;Q&#x27; plate. Once a kit car has been correctly registered, a V5C, or log book, will be assigned and then a kit car is treated in exactly the same way as a production car, from any larger manufacturer. A kit car must pass its MOT test and have a valid car tax, or have a valid Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN) declaration. As part of the IVA, a kit car can sometimes be permitted to assume the age of a single, older car (the &quot;donor car&quot;) if the major parts were taken from it in its construction. If the age identifier assigned to a kit car falls before 1980 the vehicle may be road taxed free of charge.

According to figures given to &quot;Kit Car&quot; magazine, the most popular kit in the United Kingdom in 2005 was made by Robin Hood Sportscars, who sold 700 kits a year. The editor of &quot;Kit Car Magazine&quot; suggests in 2016 the MEV Exocet was the best selling kit car.

===United States===
A glider kit is a term used in the United States for a kit of components used to restore or reconstruct a wrecked or dismantled vehicle. Glider kits include a chassis (frame), front axle, and body (cab). The kit may also contain other optional components. A motor vehicle constructed from a glider kit is titled as a new vehicle.

More common terms include &quot;partial-turnkey,&quot; &quot;turnkey-minus,&quot; and (though it technically refers to a vehicle without a body, rather than body without drivetrain) &quot;rolling chassis,&quot; or &quot;roller.&quot;

<text>Fred Asher Rosenstock (1895–1986) was an Austrian-born American bookseller, book and art collector and publisher in Denver, Colorado from the 1920s until the mid-1980s.

==Early life==
Fred Rosenstock was born Selig Usher Rosenstock in 1895 in Biala Potok in Galicia, then a province of Austria in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. His family emigrated to America in 1904. He grew up in Rochester, New York.

==Career==
During World War I, Rosenstock moved to Washington, D.C. and worked both as a civilian and later in the US Army as a stenographer. After the war he worked for a billboard company, but became ill. He was advised to move to a dry, desert climate such as California. He went west but never got past Denver.

Rosenstock had been interested in books from his youth, and by the time he was in Washington was a collector haunting the book shops and building a small collection. In Denver he continued collecting and in 1922 opened his first bookstore, the Denver Book Shop, an antiquarian book store. It was not a success. Later after marrying Frances Goodman in 1928 he purchased an existing book store in a good location on 15th Street in Denver and renamed it the Bargain Book Store. He continued to collect and sell rare books but the main business of the Bargain Book Store was selling school textbooks. This line got the business through the Great Depression. The store burned in 1948 and was rebuilt.

Meanwhile, Rosenstock continued his interest in rare books developing an interest in western history. By 1960 he began liquidating his general book business and in 1962 opened Fred A. Rosenstock Books on East Colfax Avenue in Denver specializing in western history. Fred had also developed an interest in western art and had collected many of the paintings and sculptures of Charles Marion Russell which he displayed in his bookstore.

Rosenstock became recognized as the leading bookseller in the field of western history and located and sold many books to the important western history collections, notably to the library at Brigham Young University and the Denver Public Library. He was also a publisher operating as the Old West Publishing Company, issuing about 30 significant books. By 1975, Rosenstock sold his extensive art collection and he closed his bookstore. In 1972, Rosenstock opened a gallery of western art, which he operated until having a stroke in 1984.

==Personal life and death==
Rosenstock married Frances Goodman in 1926. They had a daughter, Marilyn Weiker, in 1936. He died in 1986.

<text>Tamora Pierce (born December 13, 1954) is an American writer of fantasy fiction for teenagers, known best for stories featuring young heroines. She made a name for herself with her first book series, &quot;The Song of the Lioness&quot; (1983–1988), which followed the main character Alanna through the trials and triumphs of training as a knight.

Pierce won the Margaret A. Edwards Award from the Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) of the American Library Association in 2013, citing her two quartets &quot;Song of the Lioness&quot; and &quot;Protector of the Small&quot; (1999–2002). The annual award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot;.

Pierce&#x27;s books have been translated into twenty languages.

==Early life and education==
Pierce was born in South Connellsville, Pennsylvania in Fayette County, on December 13, 1954 to Wayne and Mary Lou Pierce. Her mother wanted to name her &quot;Tamara&quot; but the nurse who filled out her birth certificate misspelled it as &quot;Tamora&quot;. When she was five, her sister Kimberly (on whom she based Alanna) was born and a year later her second sister, Melanie, was born. From the time she was five until she was eight, she lived in Dunbar. In June 1963 she and her family moved to California. They first lived in San Mateo on El Camino Real and then moved to the other side of the San Francisco Peninsula, in Miramar. They lived in Miramar for half a year, in El Granada a full year, and then three years in Burlingame.

She began reading when she was very young and started writing when she was in the sixth grade. Her interest in fantasy and science fiction began when she was introduced to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and so she started to write the kind of books that she was reading. After her parents divorced, her mother moved her and her sisters back to Fayette County in 1969, where she spent two years at Albert Gallatin Senior High. When her family moved again, she spent her senior year at Uniontown Area Senior High School, acting, singing, and writing for the school paper. She is an alumna of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

==Career==
While at the University of Pennsylvania, Pierce wrote the books that became &quot;The Song of the Lioness&quot; quartet. The first book of this quartet, &quot;&quot; was published by Atheneum Books in 1983.

Pierce lived with her husband Tim Liebe (Spouse-Creature) in New York City, with their four cats and multiple other pets, until they moved to Syracuse, New York.

In 2008, she donated her archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Northern Illinois University.

Pierce was also actively involved in moderating and discussing her novels on a message board called Sheroes Central from about 2001-2006, at which point it was acquired by a third party.

===Writing process===
On her homepage, Pierce states she gets most ideas from things she stumbles upon. Her concept of magic as a tapestry of threads comes from her experiences in crocheting, and in her world, all mages are somehow based on British naturalist David Attenborough after watching his nature documentaries. Fantasy novels and Arthurian legend were the base of the worlds she thought up as a girl, and later she added contemporary issues like youth crime and cholera outbreaks in Africa. In general, Pierce states: &quot;The best way to prepare to have ideas when you need them is to listen to and encourage your obsessions.&quot;

Pierce draws on elements of people and animals around her for inspiration. The character of Alanna is loosely based on Pierce&#x27;s sister. Thayet&#x27;s appearance is based on a friend of Pierce&#x27;s. Beka&#x27;s pigeon friends in &quot;Provost&#x27;s Dog&quot; are all based on actual pigeons of Pierce&#x27;s acquaintance.

Pierce first started writing to escape from the drama of her parents&#x27; divorce. She wrote fan fiction based on her favorite stories, imitating them closely. Pierce says she decided to write her stories about strong female characters because she noticed a lack of them in the books she read when she was young.

<text>The Greater London Council (GLC) was the top-tier local government administrative body for Greater London from 1965 to 1986. It replaced the earlier London County Council (LCC) which had covered a much smaller area. The GLC was dissolved in 1986 by the Local Government Act 1985 and its powers were devolved to the London boroughs and other entities. A new administrative body, known as the Greater London Authority (GLA), was established in 2000.

==Background==
In 1957 a Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London had been set up under Sir Edwin Herbert to consider the local government arrangements in the London area.

It reported in 1960, recommending the creation of 52 new London boroughs as the basis for local government. It further recommended that the LCC be replaced by a weaker strategic authority, with responsibility for public transport, road schemes, housing development and regeneration. The Greater London Group, a research centre of academics within the London School of Economics, also had a significant effort on the commission&#x27;s report and the eventual creation of the GLC.

Most of the commission&#x27;s recommendations were accepted, but the number of new boroughs was reduced to 32. Greater London covered the whole County of London and most of Middlesex, plus parts of Essex, Kent, and Surrey, a small part of Hertfordshire and the County Boroughs of Croydon (Surrey) and East and West Ham (both in Essex), all of which had been independent of county council control since 1889.

Some areas on the boundaries of the area recommended by the Herbert Commission, fearing increased local taxation, fought successfully not to come under the new Greater London Council, notably the urban districts of Chigwell in Essex; and Sunbury-on-Thames, Staines and Potters Bar in Middlesex. Other areas recommended for inclusion that were never part of Greater London included Epsom and Ewell, Caterham and Warlingham, Esher, and Weybridge.

The first election for the new Greater London Council took place on 9 April 1964, and the old London County Council was abolished the following year.

==Creation==
The GLC was established on 1 April 1965 by the London Government Act 1963, which sought to create a new body covering more of London rather than just the inner part of the conurbation, additionally including and empowering newly created London boroughs within the overall administrative structure.

Within the new Greater London administrative area the council replaced Essex County Council, Hertfordshire County Council, Kent County Council, London County Council, Middlesex County Council and the councils of the county boroughs of Croydon, East Ham and West Ham.

GLC councillors elected for Inner London electoral divisions (the former County of London) became &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the new Inner London Education Authority, which took over the LCC responsibility for education. By contrast in Outer London, which was the rest of Greater London, the 20 London borough councils each became a local education authority, akin to a county council or county borough in the rest of England.

==Powers==
The GLC was responsible for running strategic services such as the fire service, emergency planning, waste disposal and flood prevention. The GLC shared responsibility with the London boroughs for providing roads, housing, city planning and leisure services. It had a very limited role in direct service provision with most functions the responsibility of the London boroughs. The GLC did not take control of public transport from the London Transport Board until 1970 and lost control to London Regional Transport in 1984.
Under the 1963 Act, the GLC was required to produce a &quot;Greater London Development Plan&quot;. The plan included in its wide-ranging remit: population changes, employment, housing, pollution, transport, roads, the central area, growth and development areas, urban open spaces and the urban landscape, public services and utilities and planning standards. The plan included the comprehensive redevelopment of Covent Garden and creating a central London motorway loop. The plan was subject to an Inquiry which lasted from July 1970 until May 1972. The campaign to save Covent Garden along with various opposition on other matters largely derailed the plan.

According to one observer:

==Composition and political control==

Each of the six GLC elections was won by the leading national opposition party, with the party in government nationally coming second in the GLC elections.

The first GLC election was on 9 April 1964. Each of the new boroughs elected a number of representatives under the bloc vote system. Despite Conservative hopes, the first GLC consisted of 64 Labour and 36 Conservative councillors and Labour Group leader Bill Fiske became the first Leader of the council.

At the next election in 1967 the unpopularity of the national Labour government produced a massive Conservative victory with 82 seats, to Labour&#x27;s 18. Desmond Plummer became the first Conservative leader of London-wide government in 33 years. The Conservatives retained control in 1970 with a reduced majority.

In 1972 the electoral system was reformed to introduce single-member constituencies for the election after the 1973 contest, and extend the term of office to four years. Labour fought the 1973 election on a strongly socialist platform and won with 58 seats to 32 for the Conservatives. The Liberals won two seats.

The GLC&#x27;s hopes under the Labour administration of Reg Goodwin were badly affected by the oil crisis of 1974. Massive inflation, combined with the GLC&#x27;s £1.6 billion debt, led to heavy rate increases (200% in total before the next election in 1977) and unpopular budget cuts. Some months before the 1977 elections the Labour Group began to split. A left group, including Ken Livingstone, denounced the election manifesto of the party.

The Conservatives regained control in May 1977, winning 64 seats under their new Thatcherite leader Horace Cutler against a Labour total of just 28. Cutler headed a resolutely right-wing administration, cutting spending, selling council housing and deprioritising London Transport. In opposition the Labour Party continued to fractionalise: Goodwin resigned suddenly in 1980 and in the following leadership contest the little-regarded left-winger Ken Livingstone was only just beaten in an intensely tactical campaign by the moderate Andrew McIntosh. However, the Labour left were strong at constituency level and as the 1981 election approached they worked to ensure that their members were selected to stand and that their democratic socialist anti-austerity convictions shaped the manifesto.

The May 1981 election was presented as a clash of ideologies by the Conservatives – Thatcherism against a &quot;tax high, spend high&quot; Marxist Labour group, claiming that Andrew McIntosh would be deposed by Ken Livingstone after the election. McIntosh and Labour Party leader Michael Foot insisted this was untrue, and Labour won a very narrow victory with a majority of six. At a pre-arranged meeting of the new Councillors the day after the election, the Left faction won a complete victory over the less-organised Labour right. McIntosh lost with 20 votes to 30 for Ken Livingstone. Livingstone, dubbed &quot;Red Ken&quot; by some newspapers, managed to gain the guarded support of the Labour deputy leader Illtyd Harrington and the party Chief Whip and set about his new administration. Livingstone&#x27;s deputy leader of the GLC from 1985 to 1986 was John McDonnell, future Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer under Jeremy Corbyn. Livingstone&#x27;s Technology Director was Mike Cooley who established The Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB).

===Elections to the GLC===
The first election was held on 9 April 1964, a year before the creation of the council. Subsequent elections were held every three years for a three-year term in 1967, 1970 and 1973. The first three elections were for 100 councillors from 32 multi-member constituencies. This was revised to 92 councillors from single-member constituencies from the 1973 election. The electoral cycle was switched to four-yearly in 1976 and those elected in 1973 had their term extended by another year. Elections were held for a four-year term in 1977 and 1981. In 1984 the elections that were due to happen in 1985 were cancelled and those elected in 1981 had their term extended by another year. The results were as follows:
===Aldermanic elections===
In addition to the councillors, there were aldermen elected by the council at the ratio of one alderman to every six councillors. Initially there were 100 councillors and sixteen aldermen elected by the council. The eight aldermen elected with the fewest votes in 1964 were for a three year term and other eight had a six year term. Eight aldermen were elected for a six year term in 1967 and 1970. In 1973, to coincide with the reduction in the number of councillors to 92, the number of aldermen was reduced to fifteen and seven aldermen were elected by the council that year. In 1976 the post of alderman was abolished, taking effect from the 1977 election. Aldermen elected in 1970 had their term extended to seven years and those elected 1973 had their term shortened to four years.

==Notable schemes==

The most notable and successful scheme of the GLC was the construction of the Thames Barrier that took place between 1974 and 1982 at a cost of £534 million. Some saw it as a GLC vanity project but over time people&#x27;s opinions have changed: the barrier was used 35 times in the 1990s and was raised 75 times in the first decade of the 21st century, due to rising sea-levels.

In 1969, the GLC announced its plans for the London Ringways which were three motorways that were proposed to solve London&#x27;s traffic problem once and for all. However, the scheme met with heavy opposition as it would have included the demolition of 30,000 homes. The Westway road scheme was opened in 1970 and hailed as a vision of the future. A review into the planned Ringways took place between 1970 and 1972. It concluded that construction should begin on the controversial Ringway One to relieve congestion in central London, but that the others needed a re-think. The &quot;Outer Ringway&quot; was given the go-ahead in 1973 and opened in 1986 as the M25 motorway. The remainder of the GLC&#x27;s Ringway plans were finally killed off in the 1980s due to public opposition. This meant that the capital was left on a much more human scale than it might have been, but also meant that London was left with an eternally unsolved traffic problem.

In 1983, GLC considered investing £230,000 into Lucas rail-bus, which could run on roads and rail tracks. The original concept was developed by Lucas Aerospace workers in the 1970s. In 1980–1981, the workers&#x27; combine built a prototype out of a second-hand Bristol bus. The enthusiasm arose from the opportunity to cut costs on rail vehicle production by partially integrating bus parts. Two challenges had to be solved—collision consequences with much heavier rail vehicles and supervision of the transition from road to rail.

After World War II large areas of homes in London remained derelict after being bombed in the war and some housing that remained standing was often squalid and overcrowded. The GLC, with new housing powers, sought to resolve this but the results were mixed: efforts to relocate Londoners from the dilapidated inner-city areas to the suburbs or satellite towns were met with resistance from the residents of those areas. Notable successful housing developments that were built by the GLC include Balfron Tower which was completed in 1967 in Tower Hamlets and Trellick Tower which was completed in 1972 in North Kensington. Both of these buildings are now Grade II* listed.

In addition to the Thames Barrier, other notable successful GLC transport schemes which changed London included the opening of the Blackwall Tunnel second bore and the improvements to the Woolwich Ferry service.

==Abolition==
Ken Livingstone&#x27;s high-spend socialist policies put the GLC into direct conflict with Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government. Livingstone soon became a thorn in the side of the sitting Conservative government. He antagonised Thatcher through a series of actions: these included posting a billboard of London&#x27;s rising unemployment figures on the side of County Hall (directly opposite Parliament), as well as the Fares Fair policy of reducing Tube and bus fares using government subsidies, and meeting Sinn Féin MP Gerry Adams at a time when Adams was banned from entering Great Britain due to his links with the Provisional IRA.

By 1983, the government argued for the abolition of the GLC, claiming that it was inefficient and unnecessary, and that its functions could be carried out more efficiently by the boroughs. The arguments for this case which were detailed in the White Paper &quot;Streamlining the cities&quot;. Critics of this position argued that the GLC&#x27;s abolition (as with that of the metropolitan county councils) was politically motivated, claiming that it had become a powerful vehicle for opposition to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government. Livingstone and three other Labour councillors resigned in protest, and won back their seats easily in the September 1984 by-elections because the Conservatives refused to stand.

The Local Government Act 1985, which abolished the GLC, faced considerable opposition from many quarters but was narrowly passed in Parliament, setting the end of the council for 31 March 1986. It also cancelled the scheduled May 1985 elections. GLC assets were assigned to the London Residuary Body for disposal, including County Hall, which was sold to a Japanese entertainment company and now houses the London Aquarium and the London Dungeon, amongst other things.

The Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) continued in existence for a few years, and direct elections to it were held, but ILEA was finally also disbanded in 1990, with the Inner London boroughs assuming control over education as the outer boroughs had done on their creation in 1965.

==Replacement==

Most of the powers of the GLC were devolved to the London boroughs. Some powers, such as the fire service, were taken over by joint boards made up of councillors appointed by the boroughs – see waste authorities in Greater London for an example. In total, around 100 organisations were responsible for service delivery in Greater London.

Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government was elected in 1997, and was committed to bringing back London-wide government. In 1998 a referendum was held on the establishment of a new London authority and elected mayor, which was approved by a two to one margin.

The new Greater London Authority (GLA) was established in 2000 and was effectively a scaled down version of the GLC. The GLA has a very different structure to the GLC, consisting of a directly elected Mayor of London and a London Assembly. The Mayor of London elections were won by the same Ken Livingstone, who began his victory speech with the words: &quot;As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago ...&quot;.

In February 2020, Labour&#x27;s Tom Copley, supported by the Conservative&#x27;s Tony Arbour, both members of the London Assembly, called for the GLC&#x27;s coat of arms to be adopted by the GLA but this has not materialised. Since the abolition of the GLC in 1986 the London Fire Brigade has continued to use the GLC coat of arms.

The archives of the Greater London Council are held at London Metropolitan Archives.

==Leaders of the GLC==

Ken Livingstone resigned on 2 August 1984, triggering the 1984 Paddington by-election. He was re-elected on 20 September 1984. During this time Ken Livingstone was not a member and John Wilson (Labour, Newham North East) acted as leader of the council.

<text>The Piophilidae are a family of &quot;true flies&quot;, in the order Diptera. The so-called cheese flies are the best-known members, but most species of the Piophilidae are scavengers in animal products, carrion, and fungi. They may accordingly be important in forensic entomology and medical entomology. For a fly maggot, the larvae of many species have an unusually well-developed ability to leap when alarmed or when abandoning their larval food to pupate; they accordingly may be known as cheese skippers or other kinds of skippers according to their food source.

==Overview==
The most notorious member of the family is the cheese fly, &quot;Piophila casei&quot;; it is cosmopolitan, and a typical member of the family. It is a small species, about long. The fly&#x27;s larvae infest cured meats, smoked or salted fish, cheeses, and carrion. The mature larva is about long and is sometimes called the cheese skipper because of its leaping ability - when disturbed, this tiny maggot can hop some 15 cm (6 in) into the air. Adults are also known as bacon flies and their larvae as bacon skippers, ham skippers, cheese maggots, cheese hoppers, etc. In the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, the larvae are intentionally introduced into pecorino cheese to produce the characteristic &quot;casu marzu&quot; (&quot;rotten cheese&quot; in Sardinian).

The adult cheese fly&#x27;s body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly iridescent and lie flat upon the fly&#x27;s abdomen when at rest. At long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common housefly.

==Behaviour patterns==
Like the larvae of various fly families, including the family Tephritidae, the larvae of typical piophilids are notorious for jumping or &quot;skipping&quot;, especially in their final instar. The larvae accomplish their jumps by bending over, grabbing onto the rears of their own bodies with their mouth hooks, and tensing their muscles in a manner that increases the pressure on their own blood and internal organs. When they release their grip, the internal pressure straightens out the tubular body, propelling the forequarters upwards, the rest of the body following. Jumping is performed most typically when the larva is alarmed by a disturbance, or when it is abandoning its feeding site in preparation for pupation.

The tiny piophilid species &quot;Protopiophila litigata&quot;, commonly known as the antler fly, breeds on discarded antlers of moose and other deer. On discarded antlers, the males form complex, highly structured aggregations in which a great deal of territorial competition occurs. In prime areas of the antler, near oviposition sites (cracks in the antler surface), males spend much of their time battling rival males. Males spend their entire lives competing on the same antler (only leaving to spend the night in nearby vegetation), making it possible to mark flies individually and obtain longitudinal field data on these tiny insects. This unique ecology made it possible to document senescence in wild insects for the first time.

The waltzing fly, &quot;Prochyliza xanthostoma&quot;, occurs in North America. It is one of the carrion-feeding piophilids and is remarkable for its sexual dimorphism and its patterns of behavioural adaptation and associated morphological adaptations. In particular, the antennae, forelegs, and heads of the males are adapted in unusual ways to their behaviour in combat and courtship. A male courts a female by dancing side-to-side, forequarters held high, displaying his elongated antennae and vibrating his elongated forelegs.

==Medical and forensic significance==
If swallowed (whether accidentally or otherwise), the larvae sometimes survive in the intestines and pass through the digestive system alive. Such behaviour is known as enteric or intestinal myiasis. In the gut, the larvae may cause serious lesions by attempting to bore through the intestinal walls. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, pain in the abdomen, and bloody diarrhea. Both living and dead larvae may pass in the stool. Some species also have been known to cause naso-oral and urogenital myiasis.

In forensic entomology, the presence of &quot;P. casei&quot; larvae may be useful in estimating the date of death for human remains because they do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death. However, &quot;P. casei&quot; is not the only piophilid species to attack human corpses, so caution is appropriate in identification of the species found and in interpretation of their significance.

==Description==
Piophilidae are small flies, often dark in color and shiny. The wings are usually clear and unmarked, with the exception of the genera &quot;Mycetaulus&quot;, &quot;Neottiophilum&quot;, &quot;Pseudoseps&quot;, and &quot;Thyreophora&quot;, which have brown wing markings. Like all tephritoid flies, female piophilids have an extensible ovipositor.

The family differs from the similar looking family Sepsidae in several characters, particularly in having the costa broken at the end of the subcosta, the setulose mesonotum and the absence of a hair or fine bristle arising on the posterior edge of the posterior spiracle of the thorax.

== Classification ==

The Piophilidae are a small family of less than 100 described species in 21 genera, mainly Holarctic in distribution, though some species are cosmopolitan. The nomenclature is volatile, with two subfamily names (Neottiophilinae and Thyreophorinae) in use recently, having been subsumed in the subfamily Piophilinae.

The genera of Piophilidae are:

* &quot;Actenoptera&quot;
* &quot;Allopiophila&quot;
* &quot;Amphipogon&quot;
* &quot;Bocainamyia&quot;
* &quot;Centrophlebomyia&quot;
* &quot;Dasyphlebomyia&quot;
* &quot;Diacanthomyia&quot;
* &quot;Lasiopiophila&quot;
* &quot;Mycetaulus&quot;
* &quot;Neopiophila&quot;
* &quot;Neottiophilum&quot;
* &quot;Piophila&quot;
* &quot;Piophilosoma&quot;
* &quot;Prochyliza&quot;
* &quot;Protopiophila&quot;
* &quot;Protothyreophora&quot;
* &quot;Pseudoseps&quot;
* &quot;Pygopiophila&quot;
* &quot;Stearibia&quot;
* &quot;Thyreolepida&quot;
* &quot;Thyreophora&quot;

<text>An auxiliary power unit(APU), is a device on a vehicle that provides energy for functions other than propulsion. They are commonly found on large aircraft and naval ships as well as some large land vehicles. Aircraft APUs generally produce 115 V AC voltage at 400 Hz (rather than 50/60 Hz in mains supply), to run the electrical systems of the aircraft; others can produce 28 V DC voltage. APUs can provide power through single or three-phase systems. A jet fuel starter (JFS) is a similar device to an APU but directly linked to the main engine and started by an onboard compressed air bottle.

==Transport aircraft==
===History===


During World War I, the British Coastal class blimps, one of several types of airship operated by the Royal Navy, carried a ABC auxiliary engine. These powered a generator for the craft&#x27;s radio transmitter and, in an emergency, could power an auxiliary air blower. One of the first military fixed-wing aircraft to use an APU was the British, World War 1, Supermarine Nighthawk, an anti-Zeppelin night fighter.

During World War II, a number of large American military aircraft were fitted with APUs. These were typically known as &quot;putt–putts&quot;, even in official training documents. The putt-putt on the B-29 Superfortress bomber was fitted in the unpressurised section at the rear of the aircraft. Various models of four-stroke, Flat-twin or V-twin engines were used. The engine drove a &quot;P2&quot;, DC generator, rated 28.5 Volts and 200 Amps (several of the same &quot;P2&quot; generators, driven by the main engines, were the B-29&#x27;s DC power source in flight). The putt-putt provided power for starting the main engines and was used after take-off to a height of . The putt-putt was restarted when the B-29 was descending to land.

Some models of the B-24 Liberator had a putt–putt fitted at the front of the aircraft, inside the nose-wheel compartment. Some models of the Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft carried a putt-putt under the cockpit floor.

====As mechanical &quot;startup&quot; APUs for jet engines====
The first German jet engines built during the Second World War used a mechanical APU starting system designed by the German engineer Norbert Riedel. It consisted of a two-stroke flat engine, which for the Junkers Jumo 004 design was hidden in the engine nose cone, essentially functioning as a pioneering example of an auxiliary power unit for starting a jet engine. A hole in the extreme nose of the cone contained a manual pull-handle which started the piston engine, which in turn rotated the compressor. Two spark plug access ports existed in the Jumo 004&#x27;s nose cone to service the Riedel unit&#x27;s cylinders in situ, for maintenance purposes. Two small &quot;premix&quot; tanks for the Riedel&#x27;s petrol/oil fuel were fitted in the annular intake. The engine was considered an extreme short stroke (bore / stroke: 70 mm / 35 mm = 2:1) design so it could fit within the in the nose cone of jet engines like the Jumo 004. For reduction it had an integrated planetary gear. It was produced by Victoria in Nuremberg and served as a mechanical APU-style starter for all three German jet engine designs to have made it to at least the prototype stage before May 1945 – the Junkers Jumo 004, the BMW 003 (which uniquely appears to use an electric starter for the Riedel APU), and the prototypes (19 built) of the more advanced Heinkel HeS 011 engine, which mounted it just above the intake passage in the Heinkel-crafted sheetmetal of the engine nacelle nose.

The Boeing 727 in 1963 was the first jetliner to feature a gas turbine APU, allowing it to operate at smaller airports, independent from ground facilities. The APU can be identified on many modern airliners by an exhaust pipe at the aircraft&#x27;s tail.

===Sections===
A typical gas-turbine APU for commercial transport aircraft comprises three main sections:

====Power section====
The power section is the gas-generator portion of the engine and produces all the shaft power for the APU. In this section of the engine, air and fuel are mixed, compressed and ignited to create hot and expanding gases. This gas is highly energetic and is used to spin the turbine, which in turn powers other sections of the engine, such as auxiliary gearboxes, pumps, electrical generators, and in the case of a turbo fan engine, the main fan.

====Load compressor section====
The load compressor is generally a shaft-mounted compressor that provides pneumatic power for the aircraft, though some APUs extract bleed air from the power section compressor. There are two actuated devices to help control the flow of air: the inlet guide vanes that regulate airflow to the load compressor and the surge control valve that maintains stable or surge-free operation of the turbo machine.

====Gearbox section====
The gearbox transfers power from the main shaft of the engine to an oil-cooled generator for electrical power. Within the gearbox, power is also transferred to engine accessories such as the fuel control unit, the lubrication module, and cooling fan. There is also a starter motor connected through the gear train to perform the starting function of the APU. Some APU designs use a combination starter/generator for APU starting and electrical power generation to reduce complexity.

On the Boeing 787, an aircraft which has greater reliance on its electrical systems, the APU delivers only electricity to the aircraft. The absence of a pneumatic system simplifies the design, but high demand for electricity requires heavier generators.

Onboard solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) APUs are being researched.

===Manufacturers===

The market of Auxiliary power units is dominated by Honeywell, followed by Pratt &amp; Whitney, Motorsich and other manufacturers such as PBS Velká Bíteš, Safran Power Units, Aerosila and Klimov. Local manufacturers include Bet Shemesh Engines and Hanwha Aerospace. The 2018 market share varied according to the application platforms:

* Large commercial aircraft: Honeywell 70–80%, Pratt &amp; Whitney 20–30%, others 0–5%
* Regional aircraft: Pratt &amp; Whitney 50–60%, Honeywell 40–50%, others 0–5%
* Business jets: Honeywell 90–100%, others 0–5%
* Helicopters: Pratt &amp; Whitney 40–50%, Motorsich 40–50%, Honeywell 5–10%, Safran Power Units 5–10%, others 0–5%

On June 4, 2018, Boeing and Safran announced their 50–50 partnership to design, build and service APUs after regulatory and antitrust clearance in the second half of 2018.
Boeing produced several hundred T50/T60 small turboshafts and their derivatives in the early 1960s. Safran produces helicopters and business jets APUs but stopped the large APUs since Labinal exited the APIC joint venture with Sundstrand in 1996.

This could threaten the dominance of Honeywell and United Technologies. Honeywell has a 65% share of the mainliner APU market and is the sole supplier for the Airbus A350, the Boeing 777 and all single-aisles: the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A220 (formerly Bombardier CSeries), Comac C919, Irkut MC-21 and Airbus A320neo since Airbus eliminated the P&amp;WC APS3200 option. P&amp;WC claims the remaining 35% with the Airbus A380, Boeing 787 and Boeing 747-8.

It should take at least a decade for the Boeing/Safran JV to reach $100 million in service revenue. The 2017 market for production was worth $800 million (88% civil and 12% military), while the MRO market was worth $2.4 billion, spread equally between civil and military.

==Spacecraft==
The Space Shuttle APUs provided hydraulic pressure. The Space Shuttle had three redundant APUs, powered by hydrazine fuel. They were only powered up for ascent, re-entry, and landing. During ascent, the APUs provided hydraulic power for gimballing of the Shuttle&#x27;s three engines and control of their large valves, and for movement of the control surfaces. During landing, they moved the control surfaces, lowered the wheels, and powered the brakes and nose-wheel steering. Landing could be accomplished with only one APU working. In the early years of the Shuttle there were problems with APU reliability, with malfunctions on three of the first nine Shuttle missions.

==Armored vehicles==

APUs are fitted to some tanks to provide electrical power without the high fuel consumption and large infrared signature of the main engine. As early as World War II, the American M4 Sherman had a small, piston-engine powered APU for charging the tank&#x27;s batteries, a feature the Soviet-produced T-34 tank did not have.

==Commercial vehicles==
A refrigerated or frozen food semi trailer or train car may be equipped with an independent APU and fuel tank to maintain low temperatures while in transit, without the need for an external transport-supplied power source.

On some older diesel engined-equipment, a small gasoline engine (often called a &quot;pony engine&quot;) was used instead of an electric motor to start the main engine. The exhaust path of the pony engine was typically arranged so as to warm the intake manifold of the diesel, to ease starting in colder weather. These were primarily used on large pieces of construction equipment.

===Fuel cells===

In recent years, truck and fuel cell manufacturers have teamed up to create, test and demonstrate a fuel cell APU that eliminates nearly all emissions and uses diesel fuel more efficiently. In 2008, a DOE sponsored partnership between Delphi Electronics and Peterbilt demonstrated that a fuel cell could provide power to the electronics and air conditioning of a Peterbilt Model 386 under simulated &quot;idling&quot; conditions for ten hours. Delphi has said the 5 kW system for Class 8 trucks will be released in 2012, at an $8000–9000 price tag that would be competitive with other &quot;midrange&quot; two-cylinder diesel APUs, should they be able to meet those deadlines and cost estimates.

<doc id="61273" wikidata="Q221337" url="?curid=61273" title="Supersonic speed">
<text>Supersonic speed is the speed of an object that exceeds the speed of sound (Mach 1). For objects traveling in dry air of a temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) at sea level, this speed is approximately . Speeds greater than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5) are often referred to as hypersonic. Flights during which only some parts of the air surrounding an object, such as the ends of rotor blades, reach supersonic speeds are called transonic. This occurs typically somewhere between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2.

Sounds are traveling vibrations in the form of pressure waves in an elastic medium. Objects move at supersonic speed when the objects move faster than the speed at which sound propagates through the medium. In gases, sound travels longitudinally at different speeds, mostly depending on the molecular mass and temperature of the gas, and pressure has little effect. Since air temperature and composition varies significantly with altitude, the speed of sound, and Mach numbers for a steadily moving object may change. In water at room temperature supersonic speed means any speed greater than 1,440 m/s (4,724 ft/s). In solids, sound waves can be polarized longitudinally or transversely and have higher velocities.

Supersonic fracture is crack formation faster than the speed of sound in a brittle material.

==Early meaning==
The word supersonic comes from two Latin derived words; 1) &quot;super&quot;: above and 2) &quot;sonus&quot;: sound, which together mean above sound, or faster than sound.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the term &quot;supersonic&quot; was used as an adjective to describe sound whose frequency is above the range of normal human hearing. The modern term for this meaning is &quot;ultrasonic&quot;, but the older meaning sometimes still lives on, as in the word superheterodyne

==Supersonic objects==
The tip of a bullwhip is generally seen as the first object designed to reach the speed of sound. This action results in its telltale &quot;crack&quot;, which is actually just a sonic boom. The first human-made supersonic boom was likely caused by a piece of common cloth, leading to the whip&#x27;s eventual development. It&#x27;s the wave motion travelling through the bullwhip that makes it capable of achieving supersonic speeds. 

Most modern firearm bullets are supersonic, with rifle projectiles often travelling at speeds approaching and in some cases well exceeding Mach 3.

Most spacecraft are supersonic at least during portions of their reentry, though the effects on the spacecraft are reduced by low air densities. During ascent, launch vehicles generally avoid going supersonic below 30 km (~98,400 feet) to reduce air drag.

Note that the speed of sound decreases somewhat with altitude, due to lower temperatures found there (typically up to 25 km). At even higher altitudes the temperature starts increasing, with the corresponding increase in the speed of sound.

When an inflated balloon is burst, the torn pieces of latex contract at supersonic speed, which contributes to the sharp and loud popping noise.

===Supersonic land vehicles===

To date, only one land vehicle has officially travelled at supersonic speed, the ThrustSSC. The vehicle, driven by Andy Green, holds the world land speed record, having achieved an average speed on its bi-directional run of in the Black Rock Desert on 15 October 1997.

The Bloodhound LSR project planned an attempt on the record in 2020 at Hakskeenpan in South Africa with a combination jet and hybrid rocket propelled car. The aim was to break the existing record, then make further attempts during which (the members of) the team hoped to reach speeds of up to . The effort was originally run by Richard Noble who was the leader of the ThrustSSC project, however following funding issues in 2018, the team was bought by Ian Warhurst and renamed Bloodhound LSR. Later the project was indefinitely delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the vehicle was put up for sale.

===Supersonic flight===

Most modern fighter aircraft are supersonic aircraft. No modern-day passenger aircraft are capable of supersonic speed, but there have been supersonic passenger aircraft, namely Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144. Both of these passenger aircraft and some modern fighters are also capable of supercruise, a condition of sustained supersonic flight without the use of an afterburner. Due to its ability to supercruise for several hours and the relatively high frequency of flight over several decades, Concorde spent more time flying supersonically than all other aircraft combined by a considerable margin. Since Concorde&#x27;s final retirement flight on November 26, 2003, there are no supersonic passenger aircraft left in service. Some large bombers, such as the Tupolev Tu-160 and Rockwell B-1 Lancer are also supersonic-capable.

The aerodynamics of supersonic aircraft is simpler than subsonic aerodynamics because the airsheets at different points along the plane often cannot affect each other. Supersonic jets and rocket vehicles require several times greater thrust to push through the extra aerodynamic drag experienced within the transonic region (around Mach 0.85–1.2). At these speeds aerospace engineers can gently guide air around the fuselage of the aircraft without producing new shock waves, but any change in cross area farther down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body. Designers use the Supersonic area rule and the Whitcomb area rule to minimize sudden changes in size.
However, in practical applications, a supersonic aircraft must operate stably in both subsonic and supersonic profiles, hence aerodynamic design is more complex.

The main key to having low supersonic drag is to properly shape the overall aircraft to be long and thin, and close to a &quot;perfect&quot; shape, the von Karman ogive or Sears-Haack body. This has led to almost every supersonic cruising aircraft looking very similar to every other, with a very long and slender fuselage and large delta wings, cf. SR-71, Concorde, etc. Although not ideal for passenger aircraft, this shaping is quite adaptable for bomber use.

=== Founding ===
Unisys was formed in 1986 through the merger of mainframe corporations Sperry and Burroughs, with Burroughs buying Sperry for $4.8 billion. 

The new company&#x27;s name was chosen from over 31,000 submissions in an internal competition when Christian Machen submitted the word &quot;Unisys&quot;, which was composed of parts of the words &quot;united&quot;, &quot;information&quot;, and &quot;systems&quot;.

The merger was the largest in the computer industry at the time and made Unisys the second-largest computer company with annual revenue of $10.5 billion. W. Michael Blumenthal became CEO and Chairman.

===20th century===
Soon after the merger, the market for proprietary mainframe-class systems, the mainstream product of Unisys and its competitors such as IBM, began a long-term decline that continues, at a lesser rate, today. Unisys responded by making the strategic decision to shift into high-end servers, including 32-bit processor Windows Servers and information technology (IT) services, such as systems integration, outsourcing, and related technical services, while holding onto the profitable revenue stream from maintaining its installed base of proprietary mainframe hardware and applications.

In 1988, the company acquired Convergent Technologies, creators of Convergent Technologies Operating System (CTOS).

In 1990, Blumenthal resigned. James Unruh, formerly of Memorex and Honeywell, became the new CEO and Chairman after Blumenthal&#x27;s departure and continued in both roles until 1997, when Larry Weinbach of Arthur Andersen became the new CEO.

===21st century===
Joseph McGrath served as CEO and President from January 2005, until September, 2008. On October 7, 2008, J. Edward Coleman replaced McGrath as CEO and Chairman. 

On November 10, 2008, the company was removed from the S&amp;P 500 index when the market capitalization of the company had fallen below the S&amp;P 500 minimum of $4 billion.

In 2010, Unisys sold its Medicare processing Health Information Management service to Molina Healthcare for $135 million.

On October 6, 2014, after six years as CEO and chairman, Unisys announced that Coleman was stepping down effective December 1, 2014.

On January 1, 2015, Unisys named Peter Altabef as its new president and CEO, replacing Edward Coleman. Paul Weaver, who was formerly Lead Independent Director, was named Chairman.

In February 2020, SAIC announced plans to acquire Unisys Federal, the company’s federal defense contracting operation, for $1.2 billion. The company’s federal customer list included over a dozen military and civilian agencies. As part of the acquisition, Unisys has a licensing agreement with SAIC to continue providing its software to federal clients.

In June 2020, Australia’s Home Affairs’ biometric identification system, built in part through partnership with Unisys, was launched.

In June 2021, the company announced the acquisition of Unify Square, which provides software and services which help enterprises manage collaboration and communication platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. In November, Mobinergy, a mobile device management software company, was acquired; and in December, Unisys acquired CompuGain, an Amazon Web Services Advanced Consulting Partner.

In July 2021, Unisys partnered with Vodafone to help the company boost its IT services. The two launched “Vodafone Digital Factory,” and Unisys helped Vodafone clients with technologies like AI, virtual, and augmented reality, and blockchain.

In May 2022, the company joined the Plug and Play Enterprise Tech program. This allowed Unisys to source and partner with technology startups to access and use early-stage emerging technology.

=== Consumerization of IT ===
A study sponsored by Unisys and conducted by IDC revealed the gap between the activities and expectations of the new generation of &quot;iWorkers&quot; and the ability of organizations to support their needs. The results showed that organizations continue to work with standardized command and control IT models of the past and are not able to profit from the widespread use of newer networked technologies.

===Cloud 20/20===
Cloud 20/20 is an annual technical paper contest for tertiary students from India in October 2009. The contest allows students to explore the possibilities and complexities of cloud computing in areas such as automation, virtualization, application development, security, consumerization of IT and airports. The contest has drawn participation from universities across India, with over 570 institutes taking part in 2009 and more than a thousand in 2010. The contest culminates in an event where five finalists present their papers before a panel of judges that comprise academicians and technologists. Prizes include the latest technology gadgets, internship projects and career opportunities with Unisys.

== People and Culture ==
Unisys earned a score of 100% on the 2021 Disability Equality Index. The company was recognized as a “Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion.” The Disability Equality Index is a joint initiative of Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities. It is a “comprehensive benchmarking tool to measure disability workplace inclusion.”

In November 2021, Unisys launched its UGrow program to help its employees grow internally. The program makes different courses available; each one focuses on skills needed by Unisys employees. Company employees also have access to Unisys University, which offers free certifications for over 100 different skills. A few examples include courses focused on management and team leadership skills, communication skills, and culture courses. The courses are organized around Unisys’ core business functions.

=== Supplier Diversity Program ===
Unisys has a supplier diversity program, which is a program that “encourages using companies owned by either minorities, veterans, women, or historically underutilized companies as suppliers.”

=== Carbon Footprint Reduction ===
In 2006, Unisys committed to reducing its carbon footprint by 75% by 2026. It achieved this five years early in 2021. A year later, the company announced a new goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030. The company also participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project and UN Global Compact.

== Controversies ==
In 1987, Unisys was sued with Rockwell Shuttle Operations Company for $5.2 million by two former employees of the Unisys Corporation, one a subcontractor responsible for the computer programs for the space shuttle. The suit filed by Sylvia Robins, a former Unisys engineer, and Ria Solomon, who worked for Robins, charges that the two were forced from their jobs and harassed after complaining about safety violations and inflated costs.

Unisys overcharged the U.S. government and was found guilty of failure to supply adequate equipment in 1998. In 1998, Unisys Corporation agreed to pay the government $2.25 million to settle allegations that it supplied refurbished, rather than new, computer materials to several federal agencies in violation of the terms of its contract. Unisys admitted to supplying re-worked or refurbished computer components to various civilian and military agencies in the early 1990s, when the contract required the company to provide new equipment. The market price for the refurbished material was less than the price for new material which the government paid.

In 1998, Unisys was found guilty of price inflation and government contract fraud, with the company settling to avoid further prosecution. Lockheed Martin and Unisys paid the government $3.15 million to settle allegations that Unisys inflated the prices of spare parts sold to the U.S. Department of Commerce for its NEXRAD Doppler Radar System, in violation of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, et seq. &quot;[T]he settlement resolves allegations that Unisys knew that prices it paid Concurrent Computer Corporation for the spare parts were inflated when it passed on those prices to the government. Unisys had obtained price discounts from Concurrent on other items Unisys was purchasing from Concurrent at Unisys&#x27; own expense in exchange for agreeing to pay Concurrent the inflated prices&quot;.

In October 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the company had allegedly overbilled on the $1-to-3-billion Transportation Security Administration contract for almost 171,000 hours of labor and overtime at up to the maximum rate of $131.13 per hour, including 24,983 hours not allowed by the contract. Unisys denied wrongdoing.

In 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the FBI was investigating Unisys for alleged cybersecurity lapses under the company&#x27;s contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. A number of security lapses supposedly occurred during the contract, including incidents in which data was transmitted to Chinese servers. Unisys denies all charges and said it has documentation disproving the allegations.

In 2007, Unisys was found guilty of misrepresentation of retiree benefits. A federal judge in Pennsylvania ordered Unisys to reinstate within 60 days free lifetime retiree medical benefits to 12 former employees who were employed by a Unisys predecessor, the Burroughs Corporation. The judge ruled that Unisys &quot;misrepresented the cost and duration of retiree medical benefits&quot; at a time &quot;trial plaintiffs were making retirement decisions&quot; and while it was advising them about the benefits the company would provide during retirement.

Also in 2007, Unisys was found guilty of willful trademark infringement in &quot;Visible Systems v. Unisys&quot; (Trademark Infringement). Computer company Visible Systems prevailed over Unisys Corp. in a trademark infringement lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. In November 2007, the court entered an injunction and final judgment ordering Unisys to discontinue its use of the &quot;Visible&quot; trademark, upholding the jury&#x27;s award to Visible Systems of $250,000 in damages, and awarding an additional $17,555 in interest. Visible Systems claimed Unisys wrongfully used the name &quot;Visible&quot; in marketing its software and services. The jury found the infringement by Unisys was willful. Visible Systems appealed the final judgment, believing the court wrongly excluded the issues of bad faith and disgorgement of an estimated $17 billion in unjust profits from the consideration of the jury.

In 2010, Unisys Hungary terminated the local Workers&#x27; Union representative Gabor Pinter&#x27;s employment contract with immediate effect for raising concerns about unpaid overtime and the company&#x27;s non-respect of the health regulations in its local Shared Services Center. According to the 2012 verdict of the Labour Court of Budapest, Unisys acted illegally and was ordered to pay unpaid wages and benefits, legal costs, and three months&#x27; average salary as compensation.

<doc id="61275" wikidata="Q369794" url="?curid=61275" title="Cathodoluminescence">
<text>Cathodoluminescence is an optical and electromagnetic phenomenon in which electrons impacting on a luminescent material such as a phosphor, cause the emission of photons which may have wavelengths in the visible spectrum. A familiar example is the generation of light by an electron beam scanning the phosphor-coated inner surface of the screen of a television that uses a cathode-ray tube. Cathodoluminescence is the inverse of the photoelectric effect, in which electron emission is induced by irradiation with photons.

== Origin ==

Luminescence in a semiconductor results when an electron in the conduction band recombines with a hole in the valence band. The difference energy (band gap) of this transition can be emitted in form of a photon. The energy (color) of the photon, and the probability that a photon and not a phonon will be emitted, depends on the material, its purity, and the presence of defects. First, the electron has to be excited from the valence band into the conduction band. In cathodoluminescence, this occurs as the result of an impinging high energy electron beam onto a semiconductor. However, these primary electrons carry far too much energy to directly excite electrons. Instead, the inelastic scattering of the primary electrons in the crystal leads to the emission of secondary electrons, Auger electrons and X-rays, which in turn can scatter as well. Such a cascade of scattering events leads to up to 103 secondary electrons per incident electron. These secondary electrons can excite valence electrons into the conduction band when they have a kinetic energy about three times the band gap energy of the material formula_1. From there the electron recombines with a hole in the valence band and creates a photon. The excess energy is transferred to phonons and thus heats the lattice. One of the advantages of excitation with an electron beam is that the band gap energy of materials that are investigated is not limited by the energy of the incident light as in the case of photoluminescence. Therefore, in cathodoluminescence, the &quot;semiconductor&quot; examined can, in fact, be almost any non-metallic material. In terms of band structure, classical semiconductors, insulators, ceramics, gemstones, minerals, and glasses can be treated the same way.

== Microscopy ==

In geology, mineralogy, materials science and semiconductor engineering, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) fitted with a cathodoluminescence detector, or an optical cathodoluminescence microscope, may be used to examine internal structures of semiconductors, rocks, ceramics, glass, etc. in order to get information on the composition, growth and quality of the material.

=== Optical cathodoluminescence microscope ===

A cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope combines a regular (light optical) microscope with a cathode-ray tube. It is designed to image the luminescence characteristics of polished thin sections of solids irradiated by an electron beam.

Using a cathodoluminescence microscope, structures within crystals or fabrics can be made visible which cannot be seen in normal light conditions. Thus, for example, valuable information on the growth of minerals can be obtained. CL-microscopy is used in geology, mineralogy and materials science for the investigation of rocks, minerals, volcanic ash, glass, ceramic, concrete, fly ash, etc.

CL color and intensity are dependent on the characteristics of the sample and on the working conditions of the electron gun. Here, acceleration voltage and beam current of the electron beam are of major importance. Today, two types of CL microscopes are in use. One is working with a &quot;cold cathode&quot; generating an electron beam by a corona discharge tube, the other one produces a beam using a &quot;hot cathode&quot;. Cold-cathode CL microscopes are the simplest and most economical type. Unlike other electron bombardment techniques like electron microscopy, cold cathodoluminescence microscopy provides positive ions along with the electrons which neutralize surface charge buildup and eliminate the need for conductive coatings to be applied to the specimens. The &quot;hot cathode&quot; type generates an electron beam by an electron gun with tungsten filament. The advantage of a hot cathode is the precisely controllable high beam intensity allowing to stimulate the emission of light even on weakly luminescing materials (e.g. quartz – see picture). To prevent charging of the sample, the surface must be coated with a conductive layer of gold or carbon. This is usually done by a sputter deposition device or a carbon coater.

=== Cathodoluminescence from a scanning electron microscope ===

In scanning electron microscopes a focused beam of electrons impinges on a sample and induces it to emit light that is collected by an optical system, such as an elliptical mirror. From there, a fiber optic will transfer the light out of the microscope where it is separated into its component wavelengths by a monochromator and is then detected with a photomultiplier tube. By scanning the microscope&#x27;s beam in an X-Y pattern and measuring the light emitted with the beam at each point, a map of the optical activity of the specimen can be obtained (cathodoluminescence imaging). Instead, by measuring the wavelength dependence for a fixed point or a certain area, the spectral characteristics can be recorded (cathodoluminescence spectroscopy). Furthermore, if the photomultiplier tube is replaced with a CCD camera, an entire spectrum can be measured at each point of a map (hyperspectral imaging). Moreover, the optical properties of an object can be correlated to structural properties observed with the electron microscope.

The primary advantages to the electron microscope based technique is its spatial resolution. In a scanning electron microscope, the attainable resolution is on the order of a few ten nanometers, while in a (scanning) transmission electron microscope (TEM), nanometer-sized features can be resolved. Additionally, it is possible to perform nanosecond- to picosecond-level time-resolved measurements if the electron beam can be &quot;chopped&quot; into nano- or pico-second pulses by a beam-blanker or with a pulsed electron source. These advanced techniques are useful for examining low-dimensional semiconductor structures, such a quantum wells or quantum dots.

While an electron microscope with a cathodoluminescence detector provides high magnification, an optical cathodoluminescence microscope benefits from its ability to show actual visible color features directly through the eyepiece. More recently developed systems try to combine both an optical and an electron microscope to take advantage of both these techniques.

== Extended applications ==

Although direct bandgap semiconductors such as GaAs or GaN are most easily examined by these techniques, indirect semiconductors such as silicon also emit weak cathodoluminescence, and can be examined as well. In particular, the luminescence of dislocated silicon is different from intrinsic silicon, and can be used to map defects in integrated circuits.

Recently, cathodoluminescence performed in electron microscopes is also being used to study surface plasmon resonances in metallic nanoparticles. Surface plasmons in metal nanoparticles can absorb and emit light, though the process is different from that in semiconductors. Similarly, cathodoluminescence has been exploited as a probe to map the local density of states of planar dielectric photonic crystals and nanostructured photonic materials.

<text>The 2002 Tour de France was a multiple-stage bicycle race held from 6 to 28 July, and the 89th edition of the Tour de France. The event started in Luxembourg and ended in Paris. The Tour circled France counter-clockwise, visiting the Pyrenees before the Alps. It has no overall winner—although American cyclist Lance Armstrong originally won the event, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005; the Union Cycliste Internationale confirmed the result.

The favourite was Armstrong, who was, at the time, the winner in the 1999, 2000 and 2001 races. The main opposition would probably come from the ONCE team with Joseba Beloki (3rd last year), Igor González de Galdeano (5th last year) and Marcos Serrano (9th last year), and from the Kelme riders Óscar Sevilla (7th last year, 2nd in last year&#x27;s Vuelta a España) and Santiago Botero (8th last year). Other riders to keep in account for a high place in the final rankings were Tyler Hamilton (2nd Giro 2002), Levi Leipheimer (3rd Vuelta 2001), Christophe Moreau (4th Tour 2000) and Armstrong&#x27;s teammate Roberto Heras (4th Vuelta 2001). Important riders who were not present were Jan Ullrich (2nd last year, injury) and Gilberto Simoni (winner 2001 Giro).

==Teams==
Teams qualified for the 2002 Tour de France by various methods. was selected because it included the winner of the previous edition, Lance Armstrong. was selected because it included the winner of the 2001 UCI Road World Cup, Erik Dekker. , and were selected because they won the team classifications in respectively the 2001 Giro d&#x27;Italia, 2001 Tour de France and 2001 Vuelta a España. A further seven teams qualified based on the UCI ranking in the highest UCI division at the end of 2001, after compensating for transfers. Five more teams were given wildcards by the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation. After the wildcards were given, it was announced that Saeco&#x27;s main rider Gilberto Simoni had tested positive for cocaine on two occasions. In response, the wildcard for Saeco was withdrawn and given to . In total, 21 teams participated, each with 9 cyclists, for a total of 189 cyclists.

==Route and stages==

In the first week, the stages were mostly flat in the North of France. The last two weeks had mountain stages in the Pyrenees and Alps. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 16.

==Race overview==
The Prologue was won by Lance Armstrong with Laurent Jalabert and Raimondas Rumšas coming in 2nd and 3rd respectively. Armstrong and his incredibly dominant US Postal team were not concerned with defending the Yellow Jersey in the early flat stages and it changed hands a few times. First it went to Rubens Bertogliati who wore it during Stage 2 and Stage 3, where Robbie McEwen defeated Erik Zabel in the sprint gaining enough time for the latter to wear the maillot jaune in Stage 4, which was a Team Time Trial. Team ONCE–Eroski won the TTT and their rider Igor González de Galdeano took over the overall lead. At this point in the Tour all of the Top 10 overall riders were either members of team ONCE or US Postal Cycling Team, but with two more ITT&#x27;s and the Mountain stages to come this meant nothing as far as the overall standings, although it did make clear the fact that these two teams were in command within the Peloton.

The ensuing flat stages were won by Jaan Kirsipuu, Erik Zabel, Bradley McGee and Karsten Kroon and by the end of Stage 8 places 1-7 were all riders for ONCE with Gonzalez leading his teammate Joseba Beloki by :04 for the overall lead as the next riders from other teams were Armstrong in 8th and Tyler Hamilton of team CSC in 9th.

Stage 9 was an Individual Time Trial won by Santiago Botero and perhaps surprisingly seven riders finished within one minute of the stage winner when it was assumed by pundits that very few riders would keep Armstrong (who finished 2nd) that close and nobody would beat him. Following the ITT Gonzalez was still in Yellow leading the GC with Armstrong in 2nd overall, Beloki in 3rd and because of their strong performances in the ITT Serhiy Gonchar and Botero moved into 4th and 5th place in the General Classification.

Stage 10 was a hilly stage with a sprint finish won by Patrice Halgand of team Jean Latour. In places 2-11 were Jérôme Pineau of team Bonjour, Stuart O&#x27;Grady of Credit Agricole, Ludo Dierckxsens of Lampre, Pedro Horrillo of Mapei, Andy Flickinger of AG2R, Nicolas Vogondy of FDJ, Nico Mattan of Cofidis, Constantino Zaballa of Kelme, Enrico Cassani of Domo and Unai Extebarria of Euskadel.

Spanish team ONCE with Beloki, Gonzalez and Abraham Olano, and American team US Postal with Armstrong, a young Floyd Landis, Viatcheslav Ekimov and the dominant Spanish rider Roberto Heras, a former Vuelta a España champion, would have the battle for the 2002 Tour de France in the mountains.

In Stage 11 Laurent Jalabert lead the stage from kilometre 6 all the way until kilometre 155 when Armstrong caught and dropped him 3 km from the finish. US Postal controlled the pace of the Peloton for most of the race. Heras lead the way setting such a high pace that most of Armstrong&#x27;s rivals were dropped before Armstrong even had to put in any work of his own, but when Armstrong finally did attack only his own teammate Heras and Beloki could stay with him, but before long Armstrong was on his own headed for the Yellow Jersey.

In Stage 12 Jalabert attacked early again with Isidro Nozal and Laurent Dufaux going with him. About halfway through the stage the chase-1 group was about 3:00 behind with Richard Virenque, Eddy Mazzoleni and Alexandre Botcharov while once again US Postal with George Hincapie at the front dictated the pursuit of the main field/peloton just over 4:00 behind Jalabert, who was once again caught less than 10 km from the finish after leading the race for most of the day.

Once again Heras fractured the group of the final ten elite riders left with only Armstrong and Beloki able to match his pace and once again when Armstrong launched his attack neither Heras or Beloki could go with him as they finished 2nd and 3rd to him 1:04 behind. Botero and Gonzalez were able to get within seven seconds of Heras and Beloki while Rumsas and Carlos Sastre finished about a minute and a half behind Armstrong.

Stage 13 was an intermediate stage and in the green jersey sprinters competition Erik Zabel and Robbie McEwen were only separated by one point. Laurent Jalabert&#x27;s relentless attacks and combative riding was paying off as not only was he in the Polka Dot Jersey as King of the Mountains but he had also moved into a top 10 position in the overall standings. The stage was won by David Millar as the GC situation remained the same.

Armstrong would only build on his lead as the race progressed and by the time the Tour crossed Mont Ventoux, the Alps and arrived in Paris Beloki was still 2nd more than 7:00 behind as Rumsas completed the podium with Colombian rider Botero in 4th and Gonzalez in 5th. White Jersey winner Ivan Basso would finish 11th overall and would become one of the only serious challengers to Lance Armstrong in the coming Tours.

Following the USADA decision ten years later, which was confirmed by the UCI, Armstrong had this, and every result after 1998 vacated. It was also decided it was best for the sport and as an example to riders of future generations that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th place riders would not be moved up to 1st, 2nd and 3rd.

===Doping===

Subsequent to Armstrong&#x27;s statement to withdraw his fight against United States Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s (USADA) charges, on 24 August 2012, the USADA said it would ban Armstrong for life and stripped him of his record seven Tour de France titles. Later that day it was confirmed in a USADA statement that Armstrong was banned for life and would be disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 1 August 1998, including forfeiture of any medals, titles, winnings, finishes, points and prizes. On 22 October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale endorsed the USADA sanctions, and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events.

==Classification leadership and minor prizes==

There were several classifications in the 2002 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist&#x27;s finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.

Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.

There was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either &quot;hors catégorie&quot;, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.

The fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was marked by the white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.

For the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.

In addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative, who wore a red number bib the next stage. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Laurent Jalabert won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award.

There were also two special awards each with a prize of €3000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder and first race director Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 16, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given in honour of the second director Jacques Goddet to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col d&#x27;Aubisque on stage 11. Santiago Botero won the Henri Desgrange and Laurent Jalabert won the Jacques Goddet.

*In stage 1, Laurent Jalabert wore the green jersey.
*In stages 2 and 3, David Millar wore the white jersey.
*In stage 4, Robbie McEwen wore the green jersey.

<doc id="61279" wikidata="Q298252" url="?curid=61279" title="John Wayne Gacy">
<text>John Wayne Gacy (March 17, 1942 – May 10, 1994) was an American serial killer and sex offender who raped, tortured, and murdered at least 33 young men and boys in Norwood Park Township, near Chicago, Illinois. He became known as &quot;the Killer Clown&quot; due to his public performances as a clown prior to the discovery of his crimes.

Gacy committed all of his known murders inside his ranch-style house. Typically, he would lure a victim to his home and dupe them into donning handcuffs on the pretext of demonstrating a magic trick. He would then rape and torture his captive before killing his victim by either asphyxiation or strangulation with a garrote. Twenty-six victims were buried in the crawl space of his home, and three were buried elsewhere on his property; four were discarded in the Des Plaines River.

Gacy had previously been convicted in 1968 of the sodomy of a teenage boy in Waterloo, Iowa, and was sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment, but served eighteen months. He murdered his first victim in 1972, had murdered twice more by the end of 1975, and murdered at least thirty victims after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. The investigation into the disappearance of Des Plaines teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy&#x27;s arrest on December 21, 1978.

His conviction for thirty-three murders (by one individual) then covered the most homicides in United States legal history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. He was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center on May 10, 1994.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
John Wayne Gacy was born at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on March 17, 1942, the second of three children and only son of John Stanley Gacy and Marion Elaine Robison. His father was an auto repair machinist and World War I veteran, and his mother was a homemaker. Gacy was of Polish and Danish ancestry, and his family was Catholic.

Gacy was close to his mother and two sisters, but had a difficult relationship with his alcoholic father who was verbally and physically abusive to his family. The elder Gacy frequently belittled his son, calling him &quot;dumb and stupid&quot; and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters. One of Gacy&#x27;s earliest childhood memories was of his father beating him at age four for accidentally disarranging car engine components. His mother tried to shield her son from his father&#x27;s abuse, which resulted in accusations that he was a &quot;sissy&quot; and a &quot;mama&#x27;s boy&quot; who would &quot;probably grow up queer&quot;. In 1949, Gacy&#x27;s father whipped him after he and another boy were caught sexually fondling a young girl. The same year, a family friend began to occasionally molest Gacy. Gacy never told his father, afraid that his father would blame him. Despite their challenging relationship, Gacy loved his father, but felt he was &quot;never good enough&quot; in his father&#x27;s eyes.

Gacy was an overweight and unathletic child. Because of a heart condition, he was told to avoid sports. In the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience blackouts. He was hospitalized on occasion because of these episodes and also, in 1957, for a burst appendix. Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in hospital; he attributed the decline of his grades to missing school. Gacy&#x27;s medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed; his father suspected he was malingering. On one occasion, he openly accused his son of faking as he lay in a hospital bed.

===Career origins===
In 1960, at age 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant precinct captain for a local Democratic Party candidate. This led to more criticism from his father, who called him a &quot;patsy&quot;. The same year, Gacy&#x27;s father bought him a car. He kept the vehicle&#x27;s title in his own name until Gacy had paid for it, which took several years. His father would confiscate the keys if Gacy did not do as he said. In April 1962, Gacy purchased an extra set of keys; in response, his father removed the distributor cap, keeping the component for three days. Hours after his father replaced the cap, Gacy left home and drove to Las Vegas, Nevada, with $136 to his name in the hope of residing with a cousin.

Gacy worked in the Las Vegas ambulance service before being transferred to Palm Mortuary. He worked as a mortuary attendant for three months, observing morticians embalming bodies and occasionally serving as a pallbearer. He slept on a cot behind the embalming room and later confessed that one evening, while alone, he clambered into the coffin of a teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock. This experience prompted Gacy to return home.

Shortly thereafter, Gacy enrolled at Northwestern Business College, despite having failed to complete high school. He graduated in 1963 and took a management trainee position with the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company. In 1964, the company transferred him to Springfield, Illinois, to work as a salesman, and eventually promoted him to department manager. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker.

During their courtship, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees. That same year, he had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, a colleague in the Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening on his sofa; the colleague then performed oral sex on him while he was drunk. By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees and was named the third most outstanding Jaycee in Illinois.

==Waterloo, Iowa==
===KFC manager===
Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn&#x27;s father subsequently purchased three Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) restaurants in Waterloo, Iowa. The couple moved there so Gacy could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn&#x27;s parents&#x27; former home. The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of about $152,600 ), plus a share of the restaurant&#x27;s profits. Gacy opened a &quot;club&quot; in his basement where his employees could drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes, he socialized only with the males. Gacy gave many of them alcohol before he made sexual advances; if they rebuffed him, he would claim his advances were jokes or a test of morals.

Gacy&#x27;s wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy later described this period of his life as &quot;perfect&quot;—he had finally earned his father&#x27;s approval. When Gacy&#x27;s parents visited in July 1966, his father privately apologized for the abuse he had inflicted before happily saying, &quot;Son, I was wrong about you,&quot; as he shook Gacy&#x27;s hand.

===Waterloo Jaycees===

In Waterloo, Gacy joined the local Jaycees chapter, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the twelve- and fourteen-hour days he worked managing the restaurants. At meetings, Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called &quot;Colonel&quot;. He and other Waterloo Jaycees were also deeply involved in drug abuse, pornography, prostitution and wife swapping. Although Gacy was considered ambitious and a braggart, the Jaycees held him in high regard for his fundraising work: in 1967 he was named &quot;outstanding vice-president&quot; of the Waterloo Jaycees and served on the board of directors.

====Assault of Donald Voorhees====
In August 1967, Gacy sexually assaulted 15-year-old Donald Voorhees Jr., the son of Donald Edwin Voorhees, a local politician and fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him heterosexual stag films regularly played at Jaycee events. Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol, allowed him to watch a stag movie, then persuaded him to engage in mutual oral sex, adding, &quot;You have to have sex with a man before you start having sex with women.&quot; Over the following months Gacy abused several other youths, including one whom he encouraged to have sex with his own wife before blackmailing him into performing oral sex on him. Gacy also tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned to conduct homosexual experiments for scientific research, and paid them up to $50 each.

In March 1968, Voorhees told his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police, who arrested Gacy and charged him with performing oral sodomy on Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch. Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a polygraph test. The results of these tests were &quot;indicative of deception&quot;. Gacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges were politically motivated—Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy&#x27;s nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees. Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy&#x27;s story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.
On August 30, Gacy promised one of his employees, 18-year-old Russell Schroeder, $300 if he physically assaulted Voorhees in an effort to discourage the boy from testifying in court. Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated park, sprayed Mace in his eyes, then beat him. Voorhees escaped and reported Schroeder&#x27;s actions to police. Schroeder was arrested the next day; initially denying involvement, he soon confessed to assaulting Voorhees, indicating he had done so at Gacy&#x27;s request. Police arrested Gacy and charged him with hiring Schroeder to assault and intimidate Voorhees.

On September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at the Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Iowa. Two doctors concluded he had an antisocial personality disorder (the clinical term for sociopathy and/or psychopathy), was unlikely to benefit from treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society. The doctors concluded Gacy was mentally competent to stand trial.

==Conviction and imprisonment==
On November 7, 1968, Gacy pleaded guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to Voorhees, but not guilty to the charges related to other youths. He claimed Voorhees had offered himself to him and that he had acted out of curiosity. His story was not believed. Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3 and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment, to be served at the Anamosa State Penitentiary. That same day, Gacy&#x27;s wife petitioned for divorce, requesting she be awarded the couple&#x27;s home and property, sole custody of their two children, and alimony. The court ruled in her favor, and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.

During his incarceration, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner. Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased its membership from 50 to 650 men in less than eighteen months. Gacy secured an increase in the inmates&#x27; daily pay in the prison mess hall and supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates, including the installation of a miniature golf course; he was presented with a distinguished service award for his efforts within the inmate Jaycee chapter in February 1970.

In June 1969, Gacy was denied parole. To prepare for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, he completed sixteen high school courses, obtaining his diploma in November 1969. On Christmas Day 1969, Gacy&#x27;s father died from cirrhosis. When informed of his father&#x27;s death, Gacy collapsed to the floor, sobbing. His request for supervised compassionate leave to attend the funeral was denied.

==Return to Chicago==
Gacy was granted parole with twelve months&#x27; probation on June 18, 1970, having served eighteen months of his ten-year sentence. Conditions of his probation included a nightly curfew and that Gacy relocate to Chicago to live with his mother. On his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane—who picked him up from the prison and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy&#x27;s innocence—that he would &quot;never go back to jail&quot; and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo. However, within twenty-four hours, Gacy had relocated to Chicago. He arrived there by bus on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a short-order cook.

On February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy who claimed that he had lured him into his car at Chicago&#x27;s Greyhound bus terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the boy into sex. The court dismissed this complaint when the boy failed to appear. On June 22, Gacy was arrested and charged with aggravated sexual battery and reckless conduct, in response to a complaint filed by a youth who claimed that Gacy had flashed a sheriff&#x27;s badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex. These charges were dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of these incidents. Gacy&#x27;s parole ended on October 18, 1971, and a month later the records of Gacy&#x27;s criminal convictions in Iowa were sealed.

===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===
With financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a ranch-style house at 8213 West Summerdale Avenue in unincorporated Norwood Park Township, Illinois, part of metropolitan Chicago. He lived there until his arrest in December 1978 and, according to Gacy, committed all his murders there.

Gacy was active in his local community and helpful towards his neighbors; he willingly loaned his construction tools and plowed snow from neighborhood walks free of charge. From 1974 to 1978, he hosted themed annual summer parties. These events were attended by up to 400 people, including politicians and business associates.

=== Second marriage and divorce ===
In August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school. Carole and her two young daughters from a previous marriage moved into the house soon after. They were married on July 1, 1972. Gacy&#x27;s mother moved out of the house shortly before the wedding.

By 1975, Gacy had told his wife that he was bisexual. After the couple had sex on Mother&#x27;s Day that year, he informed her this would be &quot;the last time&quot; they would do so. He began spending most evenings away from home, only to return in the early morning with the excuse he had been working late, or conducting business meetings. Carole observed Gacy bringing teenage boys into his garage in the early hours and also found gay pornography and men&#x27;s wallets and identification inside the house. When she confronted Gacy about these items, he informed her angrily that it was none of her business.

In October 1975, after a heated argument, Carole asked Gacy for a divorce. He agreed although, by mutual consent, she continued to live at his house until February 1976. On March 2, the Gacys&#x27; divorce—decreed on the false grounds of Gacy&#x27;s infidelity with women—was finalized.

===PDM Contractors===
In 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (for &quot;Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance&quot;). With the approval of his probation officer, Gacy worked evenings on his construction contracts while working as a cook during the day. Initially, he undertook minor repair work, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, remodeling, and landscaping. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook so he could commit fully to his construction business.

By 1975, PDM was expanding rapidly and Gacy was working up to sixteen hours per day. In March 1977, he became a supervisor for PE Systems, a firm specializing in the remodeling of drugstores. Between PE Systems and PDM, Gacy worked on up to four projects simultaneously and frequently traveled to other states. By 1978, PDM&#x27;s annual revenue was over $200,000.

====Clown====

Through his membership in a local Moose Club, Gacy became aware of a &quot;Jolly Joker&quot; clown club, whose members regularly performed at fundraising events and parades in addition to voluntarily entertaining hospitalized children. In late 1975, Gacy joined the clown club and created his own characters &quot;Pogo the Clown&quot; and &quot;Patches the Clown&quot;, devising his own makeup and costumes. He described Pogo as a &quot;happy clown&quot;, whereas Patches was a &quot;more serious&quot; character.

Gacy seldom earned money for his performances and later said that acting as a clown allowed him to &quot;regress into childhood&quot;. He performed as both Pogo and Patches at numerous local parties, political functions, charitable events, and children&#x27;s hospitals. Gacy&#x27;s voluntary public service as a clown throughout the years of his murders led to him being known as the &quot;Killer Clown&quot;.

====Employees====
Much of PDM&#x27;s workforce consisted of high school students and young men. Gacy would often proposition his workers for sex, or insist on sexual favors in return for lending his vehicles, financial assistance or promotions. Gacy also claimed to own guns, once telling an employee, &quot;Do you know how easy it would be to get one of my guns and kill you—and how easy it would be to get rid of the body?&quot;

In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee traveled to Florida to view a property Gacy had purchased; while there, Gacy raped the employee in their hotel room. After returning to Chicago, this employee drove to Gacy&#x27;s house and beat him in his front yard. Gacy told his wife he had been attacked for refusing to pay him for poor quality painting work.

In May 1975, Gacy hired 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci. Two months later, he went to Antonucci&#x27;s home, knowing the youth had an injured foot. The two drank a bottle of wine, then watched a heterosexual stag film before Gacy wrestled Antonucci to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back. One cuff was loose and Antonucci freed his arm while Gacy was out of the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci—a high school wrestler—grappled with him, obtained the key, and cuffed Gacy&#x27;s hands behind his back. Gacy threatened Antonucci, then calmed down and promised to leave if he was freed. Antonucci agreed and Gacy left. Antonucci continued working for PDM for nine months after this incident, and Gacy made no further attempts to assault him.

On July 26, 1976, Gacy picked up 18-year-old hitchhiker David Cram and offered him a job with PDM; he began work the same evening. On August 21, Cram moved into Gacy&#x27;s house. The next day, Cram and Gacy had several drinks to celebrate his 19th birthday, with Gacy dressed as Pogo. Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs, his wrists cuffed in front of his body rather than behind. He swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself.

A month later, Gacy appeared at Cram&#x27;s bedroom door intending to rape him, saying, &quot;Dave, you really don&#x27;t know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want.&quot; Cram resisted, straddling Gacy, who left the bedroom, stating, &quot;You ain&#x27;t no fun.&quot; Cram moved out on October 5 and left PDM (although he periodically worked for Gacy over the following two years). Shortly afterwards, another employee, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved in. Rossi had worked for PDM since May 23, 1976. He lived with Gacy until April 1977. Rossi sometimes assisted Gacy in clowning at grand openings of businesses: Gacy as Pogo and Rossi as Patches.
====Politics====

Gacy entered local Democratic Party politics, initially offering use of his employees to clean party headquarters at no charge. He was rewarded with an invitation to serve on the Norwood Park Township street lighting committee, subsequently earning the title of precinct captain.

In 1975, Gacy was appointed director of Chicago&#x27;s annual Polish Constitution Day Parade. Through his work with the parade, which he would supervise until 1978, Gacy met and was photographed with First Lady Rosalynn Carter wearing an &quot;S&quot; pin, indicating a person given special clearance. The event later became an embarrassment to the United States Secret Service.

==Murders==
Gacy murdered at least thirty-three young men and boys, twenty-six of whom he buried in the crawl space of his house. His victims included people he knew and random individuals lured from Chicago&#x27;s Greyhound Bus station, Bughouse Square, or off the streets with the promise of a job with PDM, an offer of drink and/or drugs, or money for sex. Some victims were grabbed by force; others were conned into believing Gacy (who often carried a sheriff&#x27;s badge and had red spotlights on his black Oldsmobile) was a policeman. Gacy usually lured a lone victim to his house, although on more than one occasion Gacy had what he called &quot;doubles&quot;—two killed in the same evening.

Inside Gacy&#x27;s home, his usual modus operandi was to ply a youth with drink, drugs, or generally gain his trust. He would then produce a pair of handcuffs to &quot;show a magic trick&quot;, sometimes as part of a clowning routine. He typically cuffed his own hands behind his back, then surreptitiously released himself with a hidden key. He then offered to show his intended victim the trick. With his victim restrained, Gacy proceeded with rape and torture. He frequently began by sitting on or straddling his victim&#x27;s chest before forcing the victim to fellate him. Gacy then inflicted acts of torture including burning with cigars, making his captive imitate a horse as he sat on their back and pulled on makeshift reins around their necks, and violation with foreign objects such as dildos and prescription bottles after he had sodomized his captive. Gacy frequently manacled his captives&#x27; ankles to a two-by-four with handcuffs attached at each end, an act inspired by the Houston Mass Murders. He also taunted many victims throughout their abuse, and was known to have partly drowned several in the bathtub before repeatedly reviving them.

Gacy typically murdered his victims by placing a rope tourniquet around their neck and progressively tightening it with a hammer handle. He referred to this as the &quot;rope trick&quot;, frequently informing his victim, &quot;This is the last trick.&quot; Occasionally, the victim convulsed for an &quot;hour or two&quot; before dying, although several victims died by asphyxiation from cloth gags stuffed deep in their throats. Except for his two final victims, all were murdered between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m. Gacy usually stored the victims&#x27; corpses under his bed for up to twenty-four hours before burying them in the crawl space, where he periodically poured quicklime to hasten decomposition. Some were taken to his garage and embalmed prior to burial.

===Murder of Timothy McCoy===
Gacy&#x27;s first known murder occurred on January 3, 1972. According to Gacy&#x27;s later account, following a family party the previous evening, he drove to the Civic Center in the Loop in the early morning to view a display of ice sculptures. He then lured 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago&#x27;s Greyhound Bus Terminal into his car. McCoy was on his way to his father&#x27;s home in Omaha, Nebraska, and informed Gacy his bus was not due until noon. Gacy took McCoy on a sightseeing tour of Chicago and then drove him to his home with the promise that he could spend the remainder of the night and be driven back to the station in time to catch his bus. Prior to McCoy&#x27;s identification, he was known as the &quot;Greyhound Bus Boy&quot;.

Gacy claimed he woke early the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway holding a kitchen knife. He jumped from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, accidentally cutting Gacy&#x27;s forearm. Gacy disarmed McCoy, banged his head against the bedroom wall, and kicked him against his wardrobe. McCoy kicked Gacy in the stomach, doubling him over. Gacy then grabbed McCoy, wrestled him to the floor and stabbed him repeatedly in the chest.

As McCoy lay dying, Gacy claimed he washed the knife in his bathroom, then went to his kitchen and saw the makings of breakfast on the table. McCoy had set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy&#x27;s room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the knife. Gacy buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered his grave with a layer of concrete. In an interview several years after his arrest, Gacy said that immediately after killing McCoy, he felt &quot;totally drained&quot;, yet noted that as he stabbed McCoy and listened to the &quot;gurgulations&quot; and gasping, he had experienced a mind-numbing orgasm. He added: &quot;That&#x27;s when I realized that death was the ultimate thrill.&quot;

===Second murder===
Gacy said he committed murder for the second time around January 1974. This victim remains unidentified; he was strangled and placed in Gacy&#x27;s closet before burial. Gacy later stated that bodily fluids leaked from the victim&#x27;s mouth and nose, staining his carpet. Gacy regularly stuffed rags, the victim&#x27;s own underwear, or a sock into the mouths of subsequent victims to prevent such a leakage.

===Murder of John Butkovich===
On July 31, 1975, John Butkovich, an 18-year-old PDM employee, disappeared. Butkovich&#x27;s car was later found abandoned with his jacket and wallet inside and the keys in the ignition.

The day before his disappearance, Butkovich had confronted Gacy over outstanding back pay. Butkovich&#x27;s father called Gacy, who claimed he was happy to help search for his son but was sorry Butkovich had &quot;run away&quot;. When questioned by police, Gacy said Butkovich and two friends had arrived at his house demanding the overdue pay, but they had reached a compromise and all three had left. Over the following three years, Butkovich&#x27;s parents called police more than 100 times, urging them to investigate Gacy further.

Gacy later admitted to encountering Butkovich exiting his car, waving to attract his attention. According to Gacy, Butkovich approached him, stating, &quot;I wanna talk to you.&quot; Gacy invited Butkovich into his car, then invited him back to his home, ostensibly to settle the issue of his overdue wages. At his home, Gacy offered Butkovich a drink, then conned him into allowing his wrists to be cuffed behind his back. Gacy later confessed to having &quot;sat on the kid&#x27;s chest for a while&quot; before he strangled him. He stowed Butkovich&#x27;s body in his garage, intending to bury the body later in the crawl space. When his wife and stepdaughters returned home earlier than expected, Gacy buried Butkovich under the concrete floor of the tool room extension of his garage in an empty space where he had intended to dig a drain tile.

===Cruising years===
In addition to being the year his business expanded, Gacy freely admitted that 1975 was also when he began to increase the frequency of his excursions for sex with young males. He often referred to these jaunts as &quot;cruising&quot;. Gacy committed most of his murders between 1976 and 1978, as he largely lived alone following his divorce.

Although Gacy remained gregarious and civic-minded, several neighbors noticed behavioral changes after his 1976 divorce, including seeing him keeping company with young males, hearing his car arrive or depart in the early morning, or seeing lights in his home switch on and off in the early hours. One neighbor later recollected that, for several years, muffled high-pitched screaming, shouting, and crying had repeatedly awakened her and her son in the early morning. She identified the sounds as emanating from a house adjacent to theirs on West Summerdale Avenue.

====1976====
One month after his divorce was finalized, Gacy abducted and murdered 18-year-old Darrell Samson. He was last seen alive in Chicago on April 6, 1976. Gacy buried him under the dining room, with cloth lodged in his throat. On May 14, 15-year-old Randall Reffett disappeared shortly after returning home from a dental appointment. Hours after Reffett was last seen by his family, 14-year-old Samuel Stapleton vanished as he walked home from his sister&#x27;s apartment. He and Reffett were close acquaintances; they were buried together in the crawl space, and investigators believe the two were murdered the same evening.

On June 3, Gacy killed 17-year-old Michael Bonnin, who disappeared while traveling from Chicago to Waukegan. Gacy strangled Bonnin with a ligature and buried him under the spare bedroom. Ten days later, Gacy murdered 16-year-old William Carroll and buried him in a common grave in the crawl space. Carroll seems to have been the first of four victims known to have been murdered between June 13 and August 6, 1976. Three were between 16 and 17 years old, and one unidentified victim appears to have been an adult.

On August 5, 16-year-old James Haakenson is last known to have phoned his family, possibly from Gacy&#x27;s home. Haakenson died of suffocation. His body was buried in the crawl space beneath 17-year-old Rick Johnston, who was last seen alive on August 6.

Gacy is thought to have murdered two unidentified males between August and October 1976. On October 24, Gacy abducted and killed teenage friends Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino: the two were last seen on Clark Street in Chicago. Two days later, 19-year-old construction worker William Bundy disappeared after informing his family he was to attend a party. Bundy died of suffocation. Gacy buried the body beneath his master bedroom. Bundy had apparently worked for Gacy.

Between November and December 1976, Gacy murdered 21-year-old Francis Alexander. His last contact with his family was a phone call to his mother sometime in November. He was not reported missing as his family believed he had moved to California shortly thereafter. Alexander was buried beneath the room Gacy used as his office.

In December 1976, 17-year-old Gregory Godzik disappeared. His girlfriend last saw him outside her house. Godzik had worked for PDM for less than three weeks when he disappeared. He had informed his family that Gacy had had him &quot;dig trenches for some kind of (drain) tiles&quot; in his crawl space. Godzik&#x27;s car was later found abandoned. His parents and older sister contacted Gacy about Godzik&#x27;s disappearance. Gacy claimed that Godzik had expressed a wish to run away from home; he also claimed to have received an answering machine message from Godzik shortly after he had disappeared. When asked if he could play the message for Godzik&#x27;s parents, Gacy said he had erased it.

====1977====
On January 20, 1977, Gacy lured 19-year-old John Szyc to his house on the pretext of buying his Plymouth Satellite. He later confessed to strangling Szyc in his spare bedroom, claiming Rossi was asleep in the house the following morning. Gacy later sold the car to Rossi for $300.

Two months later, on March 15, 20-year-old Jon Prestidge disappeared. Prestidge was last seen leaving a Near North Side restaurant. He was buried in the crawl space above the body of Francis Alexander. Shortly before his disappearance, Prestidge had mentioned he had obtained work with a local contractor. Gacy murdered one additional unidentified youth and buried him in the crawl space in the spring or early summer of 1977. On July 5, Gacy killed 19-year-old Matthew Bowman. Bowman&#x27;s mother last saw him at a suburban train station; he had intended to travel to Harwood Heights for a court appointment.

The following month, Rossi was arrested for stealing gasoline while driving Szyc&#x27;s car. The gas station attendant noted the license plate and police traced the car to Gacy&#x27;s house. When questioned, Gacy told officers that Szyc had sold the car to him in February, saying he needed money to leave town. A check of the VIN confirmed the car had belonged to Szyc. The police did not pursue the matter further, although they did inform Szyc&#x27;s mother that her son had sold his car.

By the end of 1977, Gacy had murdered six more young men between the ages of 16 and 21. The first of these was 18-year-old Robert Gilroy, the son of a Chicago police sergeant, last seen alive on September 15. Gilroy lived four blocks from Gacy&#x27;s house. He was buried in the crawl space. On September 12, Gacy had flown to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to supervise a remodeling project, and did not return to Chicago until September 16. Because Gacy was in another state at the time Gilroy was last seen, this is cited to support Gacy&#x27;s claim of assistance from one or more accomplices in several homicides. Ten days after Gilroy was last seen, 19-year-old former U.S. Marine John Mowery disappeared after leaving his mother&#x27;s house. Gacy strangled Mowery and buried his body beneath the master bedroom.

On October 17, 21-year-old Russell Nelson disappeared; he was last seen outside a Chicago bar. Nelson was looking for contracting work. Gacy murdered and buried him beneath the guest bedroom. Less than four weeks later, Gacy murdered 16-year-old Robert Winch and buried him in the crawl space. Twenty-year-old Tommy Boling disappeared on November 18 after leaving a Chicago bar. On December 9, 19-year-old U.S. Marine David Talsma disappeared after telling his mother he was to attend a rock concert in Hammond, Indiana. Gacy strangled Talsma with a ligature and buried him in the crawl space, close to John Mowery.

On December 30, Gacy abducted 19-year-old college student Robert Donnelly from a Chicago bus stop at gunpoint. Gacy drove him to his home, where he raped, tortured, and repeatedly drowned Donnelly to unconsciousness in a bathtub as he made statements such as, &quot;Aren&#x27;t we playing fun games tonight?&quot; Donnelly later testified at trial that he was in such pain that he asked Gacy to kill him. Gacy replied &quot;I&#x27;m getting &#x27;round to it.&quot; After several hours, Gacy drove Donnelly to his workplace and released him, warning him that if he complained to police, they would not believe him.

====1978====
Donnelly reported the assault, and police questioned Gacy on January 6, 1978. Gacy admitted to having had a &quot;slave-sex&quot; relationship with Donnelly, but insisted everything was consensual, adding that he &quot;didn&#x27;t pay the kid&quot; the money he had promised him. The police believed him and filed no charges. The following month, Gacy killed 19-year-old William Kindred, who disappeared on February 16 after telling his fiancée, who knew Gacy, that he was going to a bar. Kindred was the final victim buried in the crawl space.

On March 21, Gacy lured 26-year-old Jeffrey Rignall into his car. Gacy chloroformed him and drove him to his house, where his arms and head were restrained in a pillory device affixed to the ceiling and his feet locked into another device. He raped and tortured Rignall with instruments including lit candles and whips and repeatedly chloroformed him into unconsciousness. Gacy then dumped Rignall in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park, unconscious but alive.

Rignall managed to stagger to his girlfriend&#x27;s apartment. Police were informed of the assault but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall the Oldsmobile, the Kennedy Expressway and particular side streets. He and two friends staked out the Cumberland exit of the Expressway and, in April, Rignall saw the Oldsmobile, which he and his friends followed to 8213 West Summerdale. Gacy was arrested on July 15; he faced trial for assault and battery against Rignall.

By mid-1978, the crawl space had no room for further bodies. Gacy later confessed to police that he considered stowing bodies in his attic, but had been worried about complications arising from &quot;leakage&quot;. Therefore, he chose to dispose of his victims off the I-55 bridge into the Des Plaines River. Gacy stated he had thrown five bodies into this river in 1978, one of which he believed had landed on a passing barge; only four were ever found.

The first known victim thrown from the bridge was 20-year-old Timothy O&#x27;Rourke. He was murdered in mid-June after leaving his apartment to purchase cigarettes. Shortly before his disappearance, O&#x27;Rourke had told his roommate a contractor on the Northwest Side had offered him a job. On November 4, Gacy killed 19-year-old Frank Landingin. He was last seen alive by his father walking along Foster Avenue; his naked body was found close to an inlet in the Des Plaines River by two duck hunters on November 12. On November 24, 20-year-old James Mazzara disappeared after Thanksgiving dinner with his family. Mazzara had informed his sister the day before that he was working in construction. He was last seen walking in the direction of Bughouse Square.

====Murder of Robert Piest====

On the afternoon of December 11, 1978, Gacy visited the Nisson Pharmacy in Des Plaines, to discuss a potential remodeling deal with the store owner, Phil Torf. While he was within earshot of 15-year-old part-time employee Robert Piest, Gacy mentioned his firm often hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour—almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.

Shortly after Gacy left, Piest&#x27;s mother arrived at the store to drive her son home so the family could celebrate her birthday together. Piest asked his mother to wait, adding that &quot;some contractor wants to talk to me about a job&quot;. He left the store at 9:00 p.m., promising to return shortly.

Piest was murdered shortly after 10:00 p.m. at Gacy&#x27;s home. Gacy later stated that at his house, he gave Piest a soft drink before asking whether there was anything he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t do for the right price&quot;, to which Piest replied that he did not mind working hard. In response, Gacy stated &quot;good money&quot; could be earned by hustling, although Piest was dismissive. Gacy then duped Piest into donning handcuffs. Gacy&#x27;s subsequent statements regarding the events varied, although in one of his initial statements, he claimed Piest failed to resist as he removed the boy&#x27;s trousers. He also stated that as he placed the rope around Piest&#x27;s neck, the boy was &quot;crying, scared&quot;. Gacy admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying.

==Investigation==
When Piest failed to return, his family filed a missing person report with the Des Plaines police. Torf named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk to. Lieutenant Joseph Kozenczak, whose son attended Maine West High School like Piest, chose to investigate Gacy further. A check of Gacy&#x27;s criminal background revealed that he had an outstanding battery charge in Chicago and had been imprisoned in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.

Kozenczak and two Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had asked one of the youths working at the pharmacy—whom he believed to be Piest—whether there were any remodeling materials behind the store. He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job, and had only returned to the pharmacy shortly after 8:00 p.m. as he had left his appointment book. Gacy promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded, &quot;You guys are very rude. Don&#x27;t you have any respect for the dead?&quot;

At 3:20 a.m., Gacy arrived at the police station covered in mud, claiming he had been involved in a car accident. On returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in Piest&#x27;s disappearance and repeated that he had not offered him a job. Gacy reiterated that he had returned to the pharmacy in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who denied calling Gacy. At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.

===First search warrant===
Suspecting Gacy might be holding Piest at his home, Des Plaines police obtained a search warrant on December 13. This search revealed several suspicious items, including several police badges; a starting pistol; a syringe and hypodermic needle; handcuffs; books about homosexuality and pederasty; pornographic and stag films; capsules of amyl nitrite; a dildo; a two-by-four with two holes drilled into each end; bottles of Valium and atropine; several driver&#x27;s licenses; a blue hooded parka; and underwear too small to fit Gacy. They also found a class ring engraved with the initials J.A.S. and a Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt in a trash can, alongside a section of nylon rope.

===Surveillance===
The Des Plaines police confiscated Gacy&#x27;s Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles. Surveillance teams (consisting of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz) monitored Gacy as the investigation continued. The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators of Gregory Godzik&#x27;s disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river earlier that year.

On December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details of Gacy&#x27;s battery charge, learning Jeffrey Rignall had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, then chloroformed, raped and tortured him before dumping him in Lincoln Park. In an interview with Gacy&#x27;s former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich. The same day, the class ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc. An interview with Szyc&#x27;s mother revealed that several items from her son&#x27;s apartment were also missing, including a Motorola television.

By December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or at his home. He repeatedly denied involvement with Piest&#x27;s disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers more than once. That afternoon, Cram consented to a police interview, in which he revealed that, because of his poor timekeeping, Gacy had once given him a watch, explaining he got it &quot;from a dead person&quot;.

Investigators conducted a formal interview of Rossi on December 17. He informed them Gacy had sold him Szyc&#x27;s vehicle, explaining that he had bought the car from Szyc because he needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy&#x27;s Oldsmobile revealed a small cluster of fibers in the trunk, suspected to be human hair. That evening, three trained search dogs were used to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy&#x27;s vehicles. One laid on the passenger seat of Gacy&#x27;s Oldsmobile in what the dog&#x27;s handler informed investigators was a &quot;death reaction&quot;, indicating Piest&#x27;s body had been present.

That evening, Gacy invited detectives Albrecht and Hachmeister to a restaurant for a meal. Early on December 18, he invited them into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he discussed his business, his marriages and his clowning. During the conversation, Gacy remarked: &quot;You know... clowns can get away with murder.&quot;

By December 18, Gacy was beginning to display signs of strain from the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired and anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers&#x27; office to prepare a $750,000 civil suit against the Des Plaines police, demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy&#x27;s kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kimberly Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy. Byers stated that she had borrowed Piest&#x27;s parka earlier in the evening and had placed the receipt in the pocket just before she returned the coat to Piest as he left the store.

===Second search warrant===
The same evening, Rossi was interviewed a second time. This time he was more cooperative. He informed detectives that in the summer of 1977, at Gacy&#x27;s behest, he had spread ten bags of lime in the crawl space of Gacy&#x27;s house.

On December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant for Gacy&#x27;s house. The same day, Gacy&#x27;s lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing for the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited the surveillance detectives inside his house again. As Robinson distracted Gacy with conversation, Schultz walked into Gacy&#x27;s bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola television they suspected belonged to Szyc. While flushing Gacy&#x27;s toilet, the officer noticed a rancid smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a heating duct. The officers who had searched Gacy&#x27;s house previously had failed to notice this, as the house had been cold.

Investigators interviewed both Cram and Rossi on December 20. When questioned as to where he believed Gacy had concealed Piest&#x27;s body, Rossi replied Gacy may have placed the body in the crawl space. Rossi agreed to submit to a polygraph test. He denied any involvement in Piest&#x27;s disappearance or any knowledge of his whereabouts. He soon refused to continue the questioning, and Rossi&#x27;s &quot;erratic and inconsistent&quot; responses while attached to the polygraph machine rendered Kozenczak &quot;unable to render a definite opinion&quot; as to his truthfulness. Rossi did, however, further discuss the trench digging he did in the crawl space and remarked on Gacy&#x27;s insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.

Cram informed investigators of Gacy&#x27;s attempts to rape him in 1976. He stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search, Gacy had turned pale after seeing a clod of mud on his carpet and had immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had once been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and had also dug trenches, which Gacy had explained were for drainage pipes. Cram stated these trenches were wide, long and 2 feet deep—the size of graves.

====Confession====
On the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers&#x27; office in Park Ridge to attend a scheduled meeting, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Gacy appeared anxious and disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink. Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of Seagrams whiskey, and Gacy immediately drank two cupfuls. Amirante—by this stage dubious of Gacy&#x27;s claims of innocence—then asked what he had to discuss with them, placing a copy of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on his desk and stating: &quot;You said you had something new to tell me! Something important!&quot; Gacy picked up the newspaper, pointed to the front-page article covering the disappearance of Piest and said, &quot;This boy is dead. He&#x27;s dead. He&#x27;s in a river.&quot;

Gacy then proceeded to give a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by stating he had &quot;been the judge... jury and executioner of many, many people&quot;, and that he now wanted to be the same for himself. He stated he had murdered &quot;at least thirty&quot; victims, most of whom he had buried in his crawl space, and had disposed of five other bodies in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as &quot;male prostitutes&quot;, &quot;hustlers&quot; and &quot;liars&quot;, adding he sometimes awoke to find &quot;dead, strangled kids&quot; with their hands cuffed behind their back. He had buried their bodies in his crawl space as he believed they were his property.

As a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession. Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy that morning. On awakening several hours later, Gacy shook his head when informed by Amirante he had confessed to killing approximately thirty people, saying, &quot;Well, I can&#x27;t think about this right now. I&#x27;ve got things to do.&quot; Ignoring his lawyers&#x27; advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left to attend to his business.

Gacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being &quot;hazy&quot;, adding he knew his arrest was inevitable and that he intended to visit his friends and say his farewells. After leaving his lawyers&#x27; office, Gacy drove to a gas station where he handed a small bag of cannabis to the attendant, who immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him, &quot;The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.&quot; Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor and friend, Ronald Rhode. Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a bad boy. I killed thirty people, give or take a few.&quot; Gacy left Rhode and drove to Cram&#x27;s home to meet with Cram and Rossi. The surveillance officers noted he was holding a rosary to his chin, praying while he drove along the expressway.

After talking with Cram and Rossi, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled legal meeting. Cram informed the surveillance officers that Gacy had told him and Rossi that he had confessed to over thirty murders with his lawyers the previous evening. Gacy then had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.

As Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined the formal draft of their second search warrant, specifically to search for Piest&#x27;s body in the crawl space. On hearing from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him on a charge of possession and distribution of cannabis in order to hold him in custody, as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 p.m. on December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy&#x27;s civil suit, a second search warrant was granted. After police informed Gacy of their intentions to search his crawl space for the body of Piest, Gacy denied the teenager was buried there, but confessed to having killed in self-defense a young man whose body was buried under his garage.

Armed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians drove to Gacy&#x27;s home. They found Gacy had unplugged his sump pump, flooding the crawl space with water; they replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. Evidence technician Daniel Genty then entered the crawl space, crawled to the southwest area and began digging. Within minutes, he uncovered putrefied flesh and a human arm bone. Genty shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder, adding, &quot;I think this place is full of kids.&quot; A police photographer uncovered a patella in the northeast corner. The two then began digging in the southeast corner, uncovering two lower leg bones.

The victims were too decomposed to be Piest. As the body in the northeast corner was unearthed, a crime scene technician discovered the skull of a second victim alongside this body. Later excavations of the feet of this second victim revealed a further skull beneath the body. Because of this, technicians returned to the trench where the first body was unearthed, discovering the rib cage of a fourth victim, confirming the scale of the murders.

====Arrest====
After being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to &quot;clear the air&quot;. In the early morning hours of December 22, and in the presence of his lawyers, Gacy provided a formal statement in which he confessed to murdering approximately thirty young males—all of whom he claimed had entered his house willingly. Some victims were referred to by name, but Gacy claimed not to know or remember most of the names. He claimed all were teenage male runaways or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space. Gacy claimed to have dug only five of the graves in this location and had his employees (including Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would &quot;have graves available&quot;. When shown a driver&#x27;s license issued to a Robert Hasten which had been found on his property, Gacy claimed not to know this individual but admitted that this license had been in the possession of one of his victims. He also confessed to having planned to further conceal the bodies beneath his property by covering the entire crawl space with concrete in January 1979.

When questioned specifically about Piest, Gacy confessed to luring him to his house and strangling him on December 11. He also admitted to having slept alongside Piest&#x27;s body that evening, before disposing of the corpse in the Des Plaines River in the early hours of December 13. On his way to the police station, he had been in a minor traffic accident after disposing of Piest. His vehicle had slid off an ice-covered road and had to be towed free.
Accompanied by police, his lawyers, and his older sister, Gacy was driven to the I-55 bridge on December 23 to pinpoint the precise spot where he confessed to having thrown the body of Robert Piest and four other victims into the river. Gacy was then taken to his house and instructed to mark his garage floor with orange spray paint to show where he had buried the individual he had supposedly killed in self-defense, whom he named as John Butkovich. To assist officers in their search, Gacy drew a rough diagram of his basement to indicate where their bodies were buried. Twenty-six bodies were unearthed from Gacy&#x27;s crawl space over the next week; three others were also unearthed elsewhere on his property. As the flooring and walls of the property were dismantled, additional evidence including identification cards and further deviant sex books were discovered.

==Trial==
Gacy was brought to trial on February 6, 1980, charged with 33 murders. He was tried in Cook County, Illinois, before Judge Louis Garippo; the jury was selected from Rockford because of extensive press coverage in Cook County.

At the request of his defense counsel, Gacy spent over three hundred hours with doctors at the Menard Correctional Center in Chester in the year before his trial. He underwent a variety of psychological tests to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial. Gacy attempted to convince the doctors that he had multiple personality disorder. He claimed to have four personalities: the hard-working, civic-minded contractor, the clown, the active politician, and a policeman called Jack Hanley, whom he referred to as &quot;Bad Jack&quot;. When Gacy had confessed to police, he claimed to be relaying the crimes of Jack, who detested homosexuality and viewed male prostitutes as &quot;weak, stupid and degraded scum&quot;. His lawyers opted to have Gacy plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

In his opening statement, one of Gacy&#x27;s defense attorneys, Robert Motta, remarked: &quot;The insanity defense has been looked [upon] as an escape; a defense of last resort. The defense of insanity is valid and it is the only defense that we could use here, because that is where the truth lies ... because if [Gacy] is normal, then our concept of normality is totally distorted.&quot; Presenting Gacy as a Jekyll-and-Hyde character, the defense produced several psychiatric experts who had examined Gacy; three testified they found him to be a paranoid schizophrenic with multiple personalities.

The prosecutors argued that Gacy was sane and in full control of his actions. They produced several witnesses to testify to his premeditation and the efforts he took to escape detection. Those doctors refuted the defense doctors&#x27; claims of multiple personalities and insanity. Cram and Rossi testified that Gacy had made them dig drainage trenches and spread bags of lime in his crawl space. Both said Gacy looked periodically into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees they supervised did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.

On February 18, Robert Stein testified that all the bodies recovered from Gacy&#x27;s property were &quot;markedly decomposed [and] putrefied, skeletalized remains&quot;, and that of all the autopsies he performed, thirteen victims had died of asphyxiation, six of ligature strangulation, one of multiple stab wounds to the chest and ten in undetermined ways. When Gacy&#x27;s defense team suggested that all 33 deaths were caused by accidental erotic asphyxia, Stein called this highly improbable.

Jeffrey Rignall testified for the defense on February 21. Rignall wept repeatedly while describing Gacy&#x27;s torture of him in March 1978. During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony. On February 29, Donald Voorhees testified to his ordeal at Gacy&#x27;s hands and his assault at Gacy&#x27;s behest. Voorhees felt unable to testify but did briefly attempt to do so before being asked to step down. Robert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy&#x27;s hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recalled the abuse.

During the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a mistrial for reasons including that he did not approve of his lawyers&#x27; insanity plea; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had wanted to do); that his defense had not called enough medical witnesses, and that the police were lying with regard to verbal statements he had allegedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were &quot;self-serving&quot; for use by the prosecution. Judge Garippo informed Gacy that both counsels had not been denied the opportunity or funds to summon expert witnesses to testify, and that, under the law, he had the choice whether he wished to testify, and was free to indicate as much to the judge.

===Closing arguments===
On March 11, final arguments by both prosecution and defense attorneys began. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan outlined Gacy&#x27;s history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing his surviving victims—Voorhees and Donnelly—as &quot;living dead&quot;. Referring to Gacy as the &quot;worst of all murderers&quot;, Sullivan stated, &quot;John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes... I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.&quot;

After the state&#x27;s four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante spoke for the defense. Amirante accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. He attempted to portray Gacy as &quot;driven by compulsions he was unable to control&quot;, contending the State had not met their burden of proving Gacy sane beyond a reasonable doubt. Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client and asked they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that Gacy was a danger to both himself and to others, and that studying his psychology and behavior would be of benefit to science.

On the morning of March 12, William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense&#x27;s contention of insanity as &quot;a sham&quot;, arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy&#x27;s ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of one of the doctors who had examined Gacy in 1968 and had concluded he was an antisocial personality, stating that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would not have been freed. At the close of his argument, Kunkle removed photos of Gacy&#x27;s 22 identified victims from a display board and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to &quot;show justice&quot;.

The jury deliberated for one hour and fifty minutes. Gacy was found guilty of 33 charges of murder; he was also found guilty of sexual assault and taking indecent liberties with a child, both in reference to Robert Piest. At the time, his conviction for 33 murders was the most for which any person in U.S. history had been convicted.

In the sentencing phase of the trial, the jury deliberated for more than two hours before sentencing Gacy to death for each murder committed after the Illinois statute on capital punishment came into effect in June 1977. His execution was set for June 2, 1980.

==Death row==
On being sentenced, Gacy was transferred to the Menard Correctional Center, where he remained on death row for 14 years. Isolated in his prison cell, Gacy began to paint, with his artwork occasionally produced via commission. He drew inspiration from a wide range of sources for his artwork, depicting subjects as diverse as clowns (including himself as Pogo or Patches), Christ, the Seven Dwarfs, skulls, his own home, Elvis Presley, and John Dillinger. Gacy&#x27;s paintings have been displayed at exhibitions and sold at auction.

Before his trial, Gacy initiated contact with journalist Russ Ewing, to whom he granted numerous interviews between 1979 and 1981. Ewing later collaborated with author Tim Cahill to publish the book &quot;Buried Dreams&quot;. The information Gacy divulged to Ewing regarding the circumstances of his first murder would prove instrumental in establishing the identity of his first victim.

On February 15, 1983, Henry Brisbon, a fellow death row inmate known as the I-57 killer, stabbed Gacy in the arm with a sharpened wire. He received treatment in the prison hospital.

After his incarceration, Gacy read law books and filed voluminous motions and appeals, although he did not prevail in any. His appeals related to issues such as the validity of the first search warrant granted to the Des Plaines police on December 13, 1978, and his objection to his lawyers&#x27; insanity plea defense. Gacy contended that, although he had &quot;some knowledge&quot; of five of the murders (those of McCoy, Butkovich, Godzik, Szyc and Piest), the other 28 murders had been committed by employees who had keys to his house while he was away on business trips.

In mid-1984, the Supreme Court of Illinois upheld Gacy&#x27;s conviction and ordered his execution by lethal injection on November 14. Gacy filed an appeal against this decision, which was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States on March 4, 1985. The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, Richard Kling, argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial. This petition was dismissed on September 11, 1986.

Gacy appealed the 1985 decision that he be executed. The Illinois Supreme Court upheld his conviction on September 29, 1988, setting a new execution date of January 11, 1989. After the U.S. Supreme Court denied Gacy&#x27;s final appeal in October 1993, the Illinois Supreme Court formally set an execution date for May 10, 1994.

===Execution===
On the morning of May 9, 1994, Gacy was transferred to Stateville Correctional Center to be executed. That afternoon, he was allowed a private picnic on the prison grounds with his family. For his last meal, Gacy ordered a bucket of KFC, french fries, a dozen fried shrimp, fresh strawberries and a Diet Coke. That evening, he received the last rites from a Catholic priest before being escorted to the Stateville execution chamber.
In the hours leading up to Gacy&#x27;s execution, a crowd estimated at over 1,000 gathered outside the correctional center; a vocal majority were in favor of the execution, although a small number of anti-death penalty protesters were present. Some of those in favor of the execution wore T-shirts hearkening to Gacy&#x27;s previous community services as a clown and bearing satirical slogans such as &quot;No tears for the clown&quot;.

At 12:40 a.m., the procedure to administer the lethal injection began, although the chemicals used in the execution solidified unexpectedly, clogging the IV tube. The execution team replaced the clogged tube and the execution resumed. The entire procedure took 18 minutes. Anesthesiologists blamed the problem on the prison officials&#x27; inexperience at conducting an execution. This error apparently led to Illinois&#x27; adopting an alternative method of lethal injection. One prosecutor at Gacy&#x27;s trial, William Kunkle, said, &quot;He got a much easier death than any of his victims.&quot;

According to published reports, Gacy was a diagnosed psychopath who did not express any remorse for his crimes. His final statement to his lawyer before his execution was that killing him would not compensate for the loss of others, and that the state was murdering him. His final spoken words were reported to be &quot;Kiss my ass&quot;, although prosecutor William Kunkle stated in 2020 that these words were spoken to a prison official, and were not part of any official statement prior to Gacy&#x27;s execution.

After Gacy&#x27;s death was confirmed at 12:58 a.m. on May 10, 1994, his brain was removed. It is in the possession of Helen Morrison, a witness for the defense at Gacy&#x27;s trial, who has interviewed Gacy and other serial killers in an attempt to isolate common personality traits of violent sociopaths. He was cremated, and the whereabouts of his ashes remain undisclosed.

===Amber Alert===
In 1984, Sam Amirante authored procedures that were incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly into the Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984. At the time of the Gacy murders, Illinois police had to wait 72 hours before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent; the Missing Child Recovery Act removed this waiting period. Other states subsequently adopted similar procedures. As a result, a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency—commonly known as an Amber Alert.

==Victims==
Only 28 of Gacy&#x27;s victims have been conclusively identified. The youngest were Samuel Stapleton and Michael Marino, both 14; the eldest were Francis Alexander and Russell Nelson, both 21.
=== Crawl space ===
Cook County medical examiner Robert Stein supervised the exhumations of the victims buried on Gacy&#x27;s property. The crawl space was marked in sections and each body was given an identifying number. The first body recovered from the crawl space was assigned a marker denoting the victim as Body 1. He was identified as Jon Prestidge on January 6, 1979. No cause of death could be determined.

John Butkovich was labelled as Body 2; he was among the first to be identified, on December 29, 1978. On December 23, investigators returned to unearth the three corpses which had been buried in the same trench as Body 1. Body 3 (John Szyc) was buried in the crawl space directly above Body 4 (Gregory Godzik); both were identified December 29, 1978. Body 5 was buried directly beneath Body 1; this victim was discovered below the surface of the soil, indicating he was the first to be buried in this common grave.

The search was postponed over Christmas. Four more bodies were unearthed on December 26. Body 6 (Samuel Stapleton, identified through dental records November 14, 1979) and Body 7 (Randall Reffett, identified through X-rays April 12, 1979) were buried in the same grave. Reffett was found in a fetal position with a cloth gag in his mouth, leading investigators to conclude he most likely died of asphyxiation. Body 8 (Matthew Bowman, identified January 29, 1979) was found with the tourniquet used to strangle him around his neck. Body 9 (Timothy McCoy, identified via dental records and a distinctive belt buckle in May 1986) was found beneath a layer of concrete and had several stab wounds to the ribs and sternum, suggesting he was Gacy&#x27;s first victim.

On December 27, eight more bodies were discovered. Body 10, buried beneath the entrance to Gacy&#x27;s home, remains unidentified; he is estimated to have been between 17 and 21 years old and between and (). Both Body 11 and Body 12 were found with ligatures around their necks and buried beside each other in the center of the crawl space; on September 11, 1979, they were identified as Robert Winch and Tommy Boling, respectively. Body 13 (still unidentified) was found beneath the spare bedroom; he is estimated to have been between 17 and 22 years old and between and (). Bodies 14 and 15 were recovered from a common grave; both were found with their head and upper torsos inside separate plastic bags. They were identified using dental records and radiology images as Michael Marino and Kenneth Parker on March 29, 1980 (too late to include among the victims identified before Gacy&#x27;s trial). Body 16 (Russell Nelson, identified January 6, 1979) was found with a cloth rag lodged deep in his throat, causing him to die of suffocation. The seventeenth victim (identified as David Talsma using radiology images on November 16, 1979) was found with a ligature around his neck.

The following day, four more bodies were exhumed. Body 19 was buried directly beneath Gacy&#x27;s master bedroom; Body 18 (Michael Bonnin, identified January 6, 1979) was located beneath the spare bedroom, and found with a ligature around the neck. Body 20 (John Mowery, identified through dental records January 27, 1979) was buried in the northwest corner of the crawl space.

By December 29, six more bodies were unearthed. Bodies 22, 23, 24, and 26 were buried in a common grave beneath Gacy&#x27;s kitchen and laundry room, with Body 25 (Robert Gilroy, identified January 6, 1979) located beneath Gacy&#x27;s bathroom. Body 26, still unidentified, was estimated to have been between 23 and 30 years old and approximately () in height. Body 22 (identified using dental records as William Carroll on March 17, 1979) was found beneath Gacy&#x27;s kitchen with cloth-like material lodged in his throat. Two socks were recovered from the pelvic region. He was buried directly beneath Body 21, recovered the previous day; this victim, who remains unidentified, is estimated to have been aged between 15 and 24 years old and approximately () in height. The bones of victims 23 (identified as Rick Johnston January 1, 1979) and 24 were commingled; cloth was found inside the mouth of Bodies 24 and 26. Body 25 was found beneath Gacy&#x27;s bathroom with cloth lodged in the throat. The final victim recovered from the crawl space (William Kindred, identified May 16, 1979) was also found beneath the bathroom, with cloth lodged deep in his throat.

Operations were suspended due to the Chicago Blizzard of 1979, but resumed in March despite Gacy&#x27;s insistence that all the buried victims had been found. On March 9, Body 28 was found wrapped in several plastic bags and buried beneath the patio in Gacy&#x27;s backyard. Gacy&#x27;s likely second murder victim and still unidentified, he stood approximately () and is estimated to be aged between 14 and 18. On March 16, Body 29 (Darrell Samson, identified November 18, 1979) was found beneath the dining room.

All the victims discovered at Gacy&#x27;s house were in an advanced state of decomposition. Dental records and X-ray charts helped Stein identify the remains. Twenty-three were identified via dental records and two via skeletal trauma. These identifications were supported with personal artifacts found in Gacy&#x27;s home.

The head and upper torso of several bodies unearthed beneath Gacy&#x27;s property had been placed in plastic bags. In some cases, bodies were found with foreign objects such as prescription bottles lodged in their pelvic region, the position of which indicated the items had been thrust into the victims&#x27; anus. Stein concluded 12 victims recovered from Gacy&#x27;s property died of asphyxiation. Gacy&#x27;s vacant house was demolished in April 1979.

=== Des Plaines River ===
The victim found downstream from the I-55 bridge on June 30 was not connected initially to Gacy. On January 9, 1979, this victim was identified using fingerprint records and a distinctive tattoo as Timothy O&#x27;Rourke. An autopsy was unable to rule out strangulation as the cause of death. This victim was numbered 31. Following Gacy&#x27;s arrest, investigators discovered he was a further victim.

Frank Landingin&#x27;s cause of death was certified at autopsy as suffocation through his own underwear being lodged down his throat. His body was also identified via fingerprint records. A bond slip issued to Landingin the day before his death was found at Gacy&#x27;s home; he was assigned victim number 32.

On December 28, one further body linked to Gacy was found from the I-55 bridge. This victim was identified two days later as James Mazzara, whom Gacy confessed to having murdered shortly after Thanksgiving. Mazzara had been strangled with a ligature.

On April 9, 1979, a man walking along a Grundy County towpath discovered a decomposed body tangled in roots on the edge of the Des Plaines River. The body was identified via dental records as being that of Robert Piest the same evening. An autopsy revealed that &quot;paper-like material&quot; had been shoved down his throat, causing him to suffocate.

===Unidentified victims===
Five victims have never been identified. Based on Gacy&#x27;s confession, the location of the victims buried in the crawl space, and forensic analysis, police determined the most likely dates for when his unidentified victims were killed.
# January 3, 1972 – July 31, 1975. Body 28. Backyard. Male aged 14–18.
# June 13 – August 6, 1976. Body 26. Crawl space. Male aged 23–30.
# August 6 – October 5, 1976. Body 13. Crawl space. Male aged 17–22.
# August 6 – October 24, 1976. Body 21. Crawl space. Male aged 15–24.
# March 15 – July 5, 1977. Body 10. Crawl space. Male aged 17–21.

In the fall of 1979, forensic expert Betty Pat Gatliff used the skulls of the remaining unidentified victims to create facial reconstructions.
====Recent identification efforts====
In October 2011, Cook County sheriff Thomas Dart announced that investigators, having obtained DNA profiles from the unidentified victims, were to renew their efforts to identify them. At a press conference Sheriff Dart stated investigators were seeking DNA samples from across the United States related to any male missing between 1970 and 1979.

So far the identification of three victims has been confirmed, numerous other missing youths have been ruled out as being victims of Gacy, and four unrelated cold cases dating between 1972 and 1979 have been solved. Updated facial reconstructions of Bodies 10 and 13 were released in 2018.

In November 2011, William Bundy was identified through DNA testing. Shortly after Gacy&#x27;s arrest, Bundy&#x27;s family had contacted his dentist in the hope of submitting his dental records for comparison with the unidentified bodies, but the records had been destroyed after his dentist had retired. In July 2017, 16-year-old James Haakenson was identified using DNA testing. Francis Wayne Alexander was identified via forensic genealogy in October 2021.

===Possible additional victims===
At the time of Gacy&#x27;s arrest, he had claimed to investigators that the total number of murder victims could be as high as 45. However, only 33 victims were ever linked to Gacy. Investigators excavated the grounds of his property until they had exposed the substratum of clay beneath the foundations, finding 29 bodies.

Shortly after his arrest, Gacy informed investigators that after he had assaulted and then released Jeffrey Rignall in March 1978, he began to throw his murder victims into the Des Plaines River. He confessed to having disposed of five bodies in this manner; however, only four bodies recovered from the Des Plaines River were linked to him. When asked whether there were more victims, Gacy stated, &quot;That&#x27;s for you guys to find out.&quot;

Disputed DNA and dental tests conducted between 2012 and 2016 indicate that neither body found in the common grave in Gacy&#x27;s crawl space and identified as those of Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino in 1980 was actually Marino. Marino&#x27;s mother had always doubted her son&#x27;s identification because the clothing found on Body 14 was inconsistent with what he had worn when she last saw him. DNA testing conducted on the exhumed body of Parker has proven that Marino&#x27;s body had not been mistaken for his. In addition, the dental X-ray conducted on the victim identified as Michael Marino had revealed he had all of his second molars; a dental X-ray conducted on Marino in March 1976 revealed one molar had not erupted. The original identification of the body has been disputed because the exhumed body had neither an upper nor lower jaw bone. Nonetheless, the orthodontist who had identified Marino&#x27;s remains has stated his conviction in the accuracy of his findings.

On May 23, 1978, 25-year-old Charles Antonio Hattula was found drowned in the Pecatonica River near Freeport, Illinois. He had been missing since May 13. Hattula was an employee of PDM and had been linked to the initial investigation of Gacy after Michael Rossi informed investigators of both Godzik&#x27;s disappearance and Hattula&#x27;s death. Moreover, Rossi had stated that Hattula was known to have conflicts with Gacy, and when he had &quot;failed to show up at work&quot;, Gacy had informed him and several other employees that he had drowned. At the time of Hattula&#x27;s death, no more bodies could be stored in Gacy&#x27;s crawl space, which leaves a possibility he had disposed of Hattula&#x27;s body in the Pecatonica River. However, Des Plaines authorities had contacted Freeport during their investigation into Gacy, and were told Hattula had fallen to his death from a bridge. Hattula&#x27;s death has been officially ruled as asphyxia by drowning.

Retired Chicago police officer Bill Dorsch stated he had reason to believe there might be more victims buried in the grounds of an apartment building on West Miami Avenue in Chicago, where Gacy had been the caretaker for several years. In 1975, Dorsch—then a Chicago police officer—observed Gacy (whom he knew on a casual basis) holding a shovel in the early morning. When Dorsch confronted him, Gacy said he was doing work that he was too busy to do during the day. Dorsch also said that several other residents of West Miami Avenue stated they had seen Gacy digging trenches at the property in the early to mid-1970s. Gacy was then still married to Carole Hoff. In March 2012, Cook County Sheriff&#x27;s officials submitted a request to excavate the grounds of this property. The Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney denied the request, citing a lack of probable cause, including the results of a 1998 search of the property. However, the sheriff&#x27;s office noted that in 1998, a radar survey suggested fourteen areas of interest within the grounds, yet only two of these had been excavated; four of those remaining were described as being &quot;staggeringly suggestive&quot; of human skeletons. A second request to excavate the grounds was granted in January 2013, and a search of the property was conducted in the spring. Both FBI sniffer dogs and ground-penetrating radar equipment were used, but no human remains were found.

==Potential accomplices==
One of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether &quot;my associates&quot; had been arrested. When questioned whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, &quot;Directly&quot;. He later claimed Cram and Rossi were involved in several of the murders. Some defense attorneys and investigators researching the possibility Gacy had not acted alone in several of the murders have said there is &quot;overwhelming evidence Gacy worked with an accomplice&quot;.

In the 1980s, Gacy informed FBI profiler Robert Ressler that &quot;two or three&quot; PDM employees had assisted in several murders. Ressler believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims in multiple states. Gacy neither confirmed nor denied Ressler&#x27;s suspicions. Jeffrey Rignall, who had been assaulted and tortured by Gacy in March 1978, was adamant that at one point during his ordeal, a young man with brown hair had watched his abuse, and that he saw a light come on elsewhere in the house.

Three days before his arrest, two officers followed Gacy to a bar where he met two employees—Michael Rossi and Ed Hefner. An anxious Gacy was observed walking with the two out of earshot of the officers to talk before returning closer. Gacy said to both young men: &quot;You&#x27;d better not let me down, you fuckers. You owe it to me.&quot; The officers then overheard sections of a hushed conversation between Gacy and the two during which Rossi asked Gacy, &quot;And what? Buried like the other five?&quot;

In interviews from death row, Gacy said that at the time of his arrest, three PDM employees were also considered suspects in the murders—all of whom he said were in possession of keys to his house. In addition to Cram and Rossi, Gacy named his former employee Phillip Paske, who was a close associate of John David Norman and an acquaintance of Cram. In the late 1970s, Norman operated a nationwide sex trafficking ring based in Chicago known as the Delta Project. At least two victims believed to have been murdered by Gacy (Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino) had last been seen alive close to where Norman lived. This led to speculation that Gacy had been connected to this trafficking ring.

Gacy claimed that he was not in Chicago when sixteen of the identified victims disappeared. In 2012, two Chicago lawyers said travel records show that he had been in another state at the time of three of the murders, implying he had one or more accomplices.

Investigators note that Robert Young, the traveling companion with whom victim Russell Nelson was visiting Chicago at the time of his disappearance, gave differing accounts of his disappearance. Young filed a missing person&#x27;s report with Chicago police before unsuccessfully requesting money from Nelson&#x27;s parents to finance a search. When Nelson&#x27;s brothers arrived in Chicago to search for him, Young offered them a job with PDM. Young was never summoned to testify at Gacy&#x27;s trial.

<text>Frank Richard Stockton (April 5, 1834 – April 20, 1902) was an American writer and humorist, best known today for a series of innovative children&#x27;s fairy tales that were widely popular during the last decades of the 19th century.

==Life==
Born in Philadelphia in 1834, Stockton was the son of a prominent Methodist minister who discouraged him from a writing career. After marrying Mary Ann Edwards Tuttle, he and his wife moved to Burlington, New Jersey, where he produced some of his first literary work. The couple then moved to Nutley, New Jersey.

For years he supported himself as a wood engraver until his father&#x27;s death in 1860. In 1867, he moved back to Philadelphia to write for a newspaper founded by his brother. His first fairy tale, &quot;Ting-a-ling,&quot; was published that year in &quot;The Riverside Magazine&quot;; his first book collection appeared in 1870. He was also an editor for &quot;Hearth and Home&quot; magazine in the early 1870s. Around 1899, he moved to Charles Town, West Virginia.

He died in Washington, DC, on April 20, 1902, of a cerebral hemorrhage and is buried at The Woodlands in Philadelphia. 
==Writings==
Stockton avoided the didactic moralizing common to children&#x27;s stories of the time. Instead, he humorously poked fun at greed, violence, abuse of power and other human foibles, describing his fantastic characters&#x27; adventures in a charming, matter-of-fact way in stories like &quot;The Griffin and the Minor Canon&quot; (1885) and &quot;The Bee-Man of Orn&quot; (1887).

These last two stories were republished in 1963 and 1964, respectively, in editions illustrated by Maurice Sendak. &quot;The Griffin and the Minor Canon&quot; won a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1963.

His most famous fable, &quot;The Lady, or the Tiger?&quot; (1882), is about a man sentenced to an unusual punishment for having a romance with a king&#x27;s beloved daughter. Taken to the public arena, he is faced with two doors, behind one of which is a hungry tiger that will devour him. Behind the other is a beautiful lady-in-waiting, whom he will have to marry, if he opens that door. While the crowd waits anxiously for his decision, he sees the princess among the spectators, who points him to the door on the right. The lover starts to open the door and ... the story ends abruptly there. Did the princess save her love by pointing to the door leading to the lady-in-waiting, or did she prefer to see her lover die rather than see him marry someone else? That quandary has made the story a staple in English classes in American schools, especially since Stockton was careful never to hint at what he thought the ending would be (according to Hiram Collins Haydn in &quot;The Thesaurus of Book Digests&quot;, ). He also wrote a sequel to the story, &quot;The Discourager of Hesitancy&quot;.

His 1895 adventure novel &quot;The Adventures of Captain Horn&quot; was the third-best selling book in the United States in 1895.

&quot;The Bee Man of Orn&quot; and several other tales were incorporated in a book published in 1887 by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons entitled &quot;The Bee Man of Orn&quot;. Other stories included &quot;The Griffin and the Minor Canon&quot;, &quot;Old Pipes and The Dryad&quot;, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Museum&quot;, &quot;Christmas Before Last&quot;, &quot;Prince Hassak&#x27;s March&quot;, &quot;The Battle of the Third Cousins&quot;, &quot;The Banished King&quot;, and &quot;Philopena&quot;.

Like his contemporary Mark Twain, Stockton often pokes gentle fun at people&#x27;s credulity and irrationality. For instance, the protagonist of his &quot;A Story of Seven Devils&quot; (1888) is a resourceful, illiterate, preacher. One Sunday, following a scolding from his overbearing wife, he stands at the pulpit and tells his parishioners, &quot;the Bible declared that every woman in this world was possessed by seven devils&quot;. The women are incensed, and after prolonged discussions, the community resolves to dismiss him from his unpaid post unless he provides Biblical authority for his claim. In his next sermon he asks the villagers, &quot;Didn&#x27;t Jesus cast seven devils from Mary Magdalene?&quot; After his parishioners concede that Jesus did, the preacher offers the following conclusion: &quot;But did enny ob you ebber read, or hab read to you, dat he ebber cas&#x27; &#x27;em out o&#x27; enny udder woman?&quot;

Stockton&#x27;s work of science fiction, &quot;The Great War Syndicate&quot;, describes a late 19th century British–American war. An American syndicate made up of some of America&#x27;s richest men and ablest scientists conducts the war on behalf of the United States. The Syndicate quickly wins this nearly bloodless war by repeatedly demonstrating an overwhelming technological superiority. It does so through a few inventions, especially a remarkable motor-bomb which can—much like the nuclear bombs developed by an Anglo-American alliance a half a century later—level entire cities.

In the science fiction short story &quot;Negative Gravity&quot;, the protagonist invents a device that counteracts the force of gravity, letting people walk lightly upon the earth or even float above it. The device can thus make &quot;weight less and work easier&quot;. He agrees with his wife, however, not to share this invention with the world: Now there will be companies, and patents, and lawsuits, and experiments, and people calling you a humbug, and other people saying they discovered it long ago, and all sorts of persons coming to see you, and you&#x27;ll be obliged to go to all sorts of places, and you will be an altered man, and we shall never be happy again. Millions of money will not repay us for the happiness we have lost.

<doc id="61283" wikidata="Q549638" url="?curid=61283" title="Zine">
<text>A zine ( ; short for &quot;magazine&quot; or &quot;fanzine&quot;) is a small-circulation self-published work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually reproduced via a copy machine. Zines are the product of either a single person or of a very small group, and are popularly photocopied into physical prints for circulation. A fanzine (blend of &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;magazine&quot;) is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest. The term was coined in an October 1940 science fiction fanzine by Russ Chauvenet and popularized within science fiction fandom, entering the Oxford English Dictionary in 1949.

Popularly defined within a circulation of 1,000 or fewer copies; in practice, however, many zines are produced in editions of fewer than 100. Among the various intentions for creation and publication are developing one&#x27;s identity, sharing a niche skill or art, or developing a story, as opposed to seeking profit. Zines have served as a significant medium of communication in various subcultures, and frequently draw inspiration from a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; philosophy that disregards the traditional conventions of professional design and publishing houses, proposing an alternative, confident, and &quot;self-aware&quot; contribution. Handwritten zines, or carbon zines, are individually made, emphasizing a personal connection between creator and reader, turning imagined communities into embodied ones.

Historically, zines have provided community for socially isolated individuals or groups through the ability to express and pursue common ideas and subjects. For this reason, zines have cultural and academic value as tangible traces of marginal communities, many of which are otherwise little-documented. Zines present groups that have been dismissed with an opportunity to voice their opinion, both with other members of their own communities or with a larger audience. This has been reflected in the creation of zine archives and related programming in such mainstream institutions as the Tate museum and the British Library.

Written in a variety of formats from desktop-published text to comics, collages and stories, zines cover broad topics including fanfiction, politics, poetry, art &amp; design, ephemera, personal journals, social theory, intersectional feminism, single-topic obsession, or sexual content far enough outside the to be prohibitive of inclusion in more traditional media. (An example of the latter is Boyd McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, which reached a circulation of 20,000.) Although there are a few eras associated with zine-making, this &quot;wave&quot; narrative proposes a limited view of the vast range of topics, styles and environments zines occupied.

== History ==
=== Overview and origins ===
Dissidents, under-represented, and marginalized groups have published their own opinions in leaflet and pamphlet form for as long as such technology has been available. The concept of zines can be traced to the amateur press movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, which would in turn intersect with Black literary magazines during the Harlem Renaissance, and the subculture of science fiction fandom in the 1930s. The popular graphic-style associated with zines is influenced artistically and politically by the subcultures of Dada, Fluxus, Surrealism, and Situationism.

Many trace zines&#x27; lineage from as far back as Thomas Paine&#x27;s exceptionally popular 1776 pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot;, Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s literary magazine for psychiatric patients at a Pennsylvania hospital and &quot;The Dial&quot; (1840–44) by Margaret Fuller and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Zines were given a pop culture revival in March 2021 with the release of the Amy Poehler-directed film &quot;Moxie&quot;, released by Netflix, about a 16-year old high school student who starts a feminist zine to empower the young women at her school.

== 1920s ==

=== &quot;Little magazines&quot; during the Harlem Renaissance ===
In the 1920s during the Harlem Renaissance, a group of Black creatives in Harlem began a literary magazine &quot;the better to express ourselves freely and independently – without interference from old heads, white or [black].&quot; This led to the creation of a &quot;little magazine&quot; entitled &quot;Fire!!.&quot; Only one issue of &quot;Fire!!&quot; was released, but this inspired the creation of other &quot;little magazines&quot; by Black authors. Contributions by Black writers, artists, and activists to the zine movement are often overlooked, in part &quot;because they had such short runs and were spearheaded by a single or small group of individuals.&quot;

== 1930s–1960s and science fiction ==

During and after the Great Depression, editors of &quot;pulp&quot; science fiction magazines became increasingly frustrated with letters detailing the impossibilities of their science fiction stories. Over time they began to publish these overly-scrutinizing letters, complete with their return addresses. Hugo Gernsback published the first science fiction magazine, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1926. In January 1927, Gernsback introduced a large letter column which printed reader&#x27;s addresses. allowing them to write to each other; it was out of this mailing list that fans&#x27; own science fiction fanzines began. Fans also began writing to each other not only about science fiction but about fandom itself, leading to perzines. Science fiction fanzines vary in content, from short stories to convention reports to fanfiction were one of the earliest incarnations of the zine and influenced subsequent publications. &quot;Zinesters&quot; like Lisa Ben and Jim Kepner honed their talents in the science fiction fandom before tackling gay rights, creating zines such as &quot;Vice Versa&quot; and &quot;ONE&quot; that drew networking and distribution ideas from their science fiction roots. A number of leading science fiction and fantasy authors rose through the ranks of fandom, creating &quot;pro-zines&quot; such as Frederik Pohl and Isaac Asimov. The first science fiction fanzine, &quot;The Comet&quot;, was published in 1930 by the Science Correspondence Club in Chicago and edited by Raymond A. Palmer and Walter Dennis. The first version of Superman (a bald-headed villain) appeared in the third issue of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster&#x27;s 1933 fanzine &quot;Science Fiction&quot;.

=== &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===
The first media fanzine was a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan publication called &quot;Spockanalia&quot;, published in September 1967 by members of the Lunarians. Some of the earliest examples of academic fandom were written on &quot;Star Trek&quot; zines, specifically K/S (Kirk/Spock) slash zines, which featured a gay relationship between the two. Author Joanna Russ wrote in her 1985 analysis of K/S zines that slash fandom at the time consisted of around 500 core fans and was 100% female. 
&quot;K/S not only speaks to my condition. It is written in Female. I don&#x27;t mean that literally, of course. What I mean is that I can read it without translating it from the consensual, public world, which is sexist, and unconcerned with women per se, and managing to make it make sense to me and my condition.&quot;
Russ observed that while science fiction fans looked down on &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans, &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans looked down on K/S writers. Kirk/Spock zines contained fanfiction, artwork, and poetry created by fans. Zines were then sent to fans on a mailing list or sold at conventions. Many had high production values and some were sold at convention auctions for hundreds of dollars.

=== &quot;Janus&quot; and &quot;Aurora&quot; ===
&quot;Janus&quot;, later called &quot;Aurora&quot;, was a science fiction feminist zine created by Janice Bogstad and Jeanne Gomoll in 1975. It contained short stories, essays, and film reviews. Among its contributors were authors such as Octavia Butler, Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, and Suzette Hayden Elgin. &quot;Janus/Aurora&quot; was nominated for the Hugo Award for &quot;Best Fanzine&quot; in 1978, 1979, and 1980. &quot;Janus/Aurora&quot; was the most prominent science fiction feminist zine during its run, as well as one of the only zines that dealt with such content.

=== Comics ===
Comics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the fanzines of science fiction fandom. They often included fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine (&quot;The Comic Reader&quot; was one example), interview, history and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises.

In 1936, David Kyle published &quot; The Fantasy World &quot;, possibly the first comics fanzine.

Malcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started &quot;The Comic Collector&#x27;s News&quot; in October 1947. In 1953, Bhob Stewart published &quot;The EC Fan Bulletin&quot;, which launched EC fandom of imitative Entertaining Comic fanzines. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was Ron Parker&#x27;s &quot;Hoo-Hah!&quot; In 1960, Richard and Pat Lupoff launched their science fiction and comics fanzine Xero and in 1961, Jerry Bails&#x27; Alter Ego, devoted to costumed heroes, became a focal point for superhero comics fandom.

=== Horror ===
Calvin T. Beck&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Frankenstein&quot; (later &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot;) and Gary Svehla&#x27;s &quot;Gore Creatures&quot; were the first horror fanzines created as more serious alternatives to the popular Forrest J Ackerman 1958 magazine &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland.&quot; &quot;Garden Ghouls Gazette&quot; – a 1960s horror title under the editorship of Dave Keil, then Gary Collins—was later headed by Frederick S. Clarke and in 1967 became the respected journal &quot;Cinefantastique.&quot; It later became a prozine under journalist-screenwriter Mark A. Altman and has continued as a webzine. Richard Klemensen&#x27;s &quot;Little Shoppe of Horrors&quot;, having a particular focus on &quot;Hammer Horrors&quot;, began in 1972 and is still publishing as of 2017. The Baltimore-based &quot;Black Oracle&quot; (1969–1978) from writer-turned-John Waters repertory member George Stover was a diminutive zine that evolved into the larger-format &quot;Cinemacabre.&quot; Stover&#x27;s &quot;Black Oracle&quot; partner Bill George published his own short-lived zine &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1974–1976; with co-editor Martin Falck), and later became editor of the &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; prozine spinoff &quot;Femme Fatales.&quot; In the mid-1970s, North Carolina teenager Sam Irvin published the horror/science-fiction fanzine &quot;Bizarre&quot; which included his original interviews with UK actors and filmmakers; Irvin would later become a producer-director in his own right. &quot;Japanese Fantasy Film Journal&quot; (JFFJ) (1968–1983) from Greg Shoemaker covered Toho&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; and his Asian brethren. Japanese Giants (JG) appeared in 1974 and was published for 30 years. In 1993, &quot;G-FAN&quot; was published, and reached its 100th regularly published issue in Fall 2012. &quot;FXRH&quot; (Special effects by Ray Harryhausen) (1971–1976) was a specialized zine co-created by future Hollywood FX artist Ernest D. Farino.

=== Board games ===
Board game-focused zines, especially those focused on the board game &quot;Diplomacy&quot;, took off in the 1960s. These not only contained news and articles about the hobby, but also served as a common form for the organisation of play-by-mail games.

== Rock and roll ==
Several fans active in science fiction and comics fandom recognized a shared interest in rock music, and the rock fanzine was born. Paul Williams and Greg Shaw were two such science fiction fans turned rock zine editors. Williams&#x27; &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; (1966) and Shaw&#x27;s two California-based zines, &quot;Mojo Navigator&quot; &quot;Rock and Roll News&quot; (1966) and &quot;Who Put the Bomp&quot; (1970), are among the most popular early rock fanzines.

&quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music &quot;prozines&quot; with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. &quot;Bomp&quot; remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus, Ken Barnes, Ed Ward, Dave Marsh, Mike Saunders and R. Meltzer as well as cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler (both veterans of science fiction and Comics fandom). Other rock fanzines of this period include &quot;denim delinquent&quot; (1971) edited by Jymn Parrett, &quot;Flash&quot; (1972) edited by Mark Shipper, &quot;Eurock Magazine&quot; (1973–1993) edited by Archie Patterson and &quot;Bam Balam&quot; written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland (1974).

In the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s megastardom following the &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; album and Born in the U.S.A. Tour in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere. Gary Desmond&#x27;s &quot;Candy&#x27;s Room&quot;, coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980. This was quickly followed by Dan French&#x27;s &quot;Point Blank&quot;, Dave Percival&#x27;s &quot;The Fever&quot;, Jeff Matthews&#x27; &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, and Paul Limbrick&#x27;s &quot;Jackson Cage&quot;. In the US, &quot;Backstreets Magazine&quot; started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen&#x27;s management and official website. &quot;Crème Brûlée&quot; documented post-rock genre and experimental music (1990s).

== 1970s and punk ==
Punk zines emerged as part of the punk subculture in the late 1970s, along with the increasing accessibility to copy machines, publishing software, and home printing technologies. Punk became a genre for the working class because of the economic necessity to use creative DIY methods, which were echoed in both zine and Punk music creation. Zines became vital to the popularization and spread of punk spreading to countries outside the UK and America, such as Ireland, Indonesia, and more by 1977. Amateur, fan-created zines played an important role in spreading information about different scenes (city or regional-based subcultures) and bands (e.g. British fanzines like Mark Perry&#x27;s &quot;Sniffin Glue&quot; and Shane MacGowan&#x27;s &quot;Bondage&quot;) in the pre-Internet era. They typically included reviews of shows and records, interviews with bands, letters, and ads for records and labels.

The punk subculture in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media. The first and still best known UK &#x27;punk zine&#x27; was &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot;, produced by Deptford punk fan Mark Perry which ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue produced by Perry immediately following (and in response to) the London debut of the Ramones on 4 July 1976. Other UK fanzines included &quot;Blam!&quot;, &quot;Bombsite&quot;, &quot;Burnt Offering&quot;, &quot;Chainsaw&quot;, &quot;New Crimes&quot;, &quot;Vague&quot;, &quot;Jamming&quot;, Artcore Fanzine, &quot;Love and Molotov Cocktails&quot;, &quot;To Hell With Poverty&quot;, &quot;New Youth&quot;, &quot;Peroxide&quot;, &quot;ENZK&quot;, &quot;Juniper beri-beri&quot;, &quot;No Cure&quot;,&quot;Communication Blur&quot;, &quot;Rox&quot;, &quot;Grim Humour&quot;, &quot;Spuno&quot;, &quot;Cool Notes&quot; and &quot;Fumes&quot;. By 1990, &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot; &quot;had become the de facto bible of the scene, presenting a &quot;passionate yet dogmatic view&quot; of what hardcore was supposed to be.&quot; &quot;HeartattaCk&quot; and &quot;Profane Existence&quot; took the DIY lifestyle to a religious level for emo and post-hardcore and crust punk culture. &quot;Slug and Lettuce&quot; started at the state college of PA and became an international 10,000 copy production – all for free. In Canada, the zine &quot;Standard Issue&quot; chronicles the Ottawa hardcore scene. The Bay Area zine &quot;Cometbus&quot; was first created at Berkeley by the zinester and musician Aaron Cometbus. &quot;Gearhead Nation&quot; was a monthly punk freesheet that lasted from the early 1990s to 1997 in Dublin, Ireland. Some hardcore punk zines became available online such as the e-zine chronicling the Australian hardcore scene, &quot;RestAssured.&quot; In Italy, &quot;Mazquerade&quot; ran from 1979 to 1981 and Raw Art Fanzine ran from 1995 to 2000.

In the US, &quot;Flipside&quot; (created by Al Kowalewski, Pooch (Patrick DiPuccio), Larry Lash (Steven Shoemaker), Tory, X-8 (Sam Diaz)) and &quot;Slash&quot; (created by Steve Samioff and Claude Bessy) were important punk zines for the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977. In 1977 in Australia, Bruce Milne and Clinton Walker fused their respective punk zines &quot;Plastered Press&quot; and &quot;Suicide Alley&quot; to launch &quot;Pulp&quot;; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, in 1980. In the American Midwest, a zine called Touch and Go described the area&#x27;s hardcore scene from 1979 to 1983. We Got Power described the LA scene from 1981 to 1984, and included show reviews and band interviews with groups including DOA, the Misfits, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies, and the Circle Jerks. My Rules was a photo zine that included photos of hardcore shows from across the US an in Effect, launched in 1988 described the New York City punk scene. Among later titles, &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot; is a major punk zine, with over 300 issues published. As a result, in part, of the popular and commercial resurgence of punk in the late 1980s, and after, with the growing popularity of such bands as Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Fugazi, Bikini Kill, Green Day and the Offspring, a number of other punk zines have appeared, such as &quot;Dagger&quot;, &quot;Profane Existence&quot;, &quot;Punk Planet&quot;, &quot;Razorcake&quot;, &quot;Slug and Lettuce&quot;, &quot;Sobriquet&quot; and &quot;Tail Spins&quot;. The early American punk zine &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine &quot;Re/Search&quot;.

&quot;In the post-punk era several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax&#x27; &quot;Ugly Things&quot;, Billy Miller and Miriam Linna&#x27;s &quot;Kicks&quot;, Jake Austen&#x27;s &quot;Roctober&quot;, Kim Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Scram&quot;, P. Edwin Letcher&#x27;s &quot;Garage &amp; Beat&quot;, and the UK&#x27;s Shindig! and Italy&#x27;s &quot;Misty Lane&quot;.&quot; Mark Wilkins, the promotion director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label Mystic Records, had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited &quot;The Mystic News Newsletter&quot; which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine &quot;Wild Times&quot; and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.

== &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; ==
During the 1980s and onwards, &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; (the name came from a short story by John Brunner), originally published by Mike Gunderloy and now defunct, catalogued and reviewed any zine or small press creation sent to it, along with their mailing addresses. In doing so, it formed a networking point for zine creators and readers (often the same people). The concept of &quot;zine&quot; as an art form distinct from &quot;fanzine&quot;, and of the &quot;zinesters&quot; as member of their own subculture, had emerged. Zines of this era ranged from perzines of all varieties to those that covered an assortment of different and obscure topics. Genres reviewed by Factsheet Five included quirky, medley, fringe, music, punk, grrrlz, personal, science fiction, food, humour, spirituality, politics, queer, arts &amp; letters, comix.

== 1990s and riot grrrl ==
The riot grrrl movement emerged from the DIY Punk subculture in tandem with the American era of third-wave feminism, and used the consciousness-raising method of organizing and communication. As feminist documents, they follow a longer legacy of feminist and women&#x27;s self-publication that includes scrapbooking, periodicals and health publications, allowing women to circulate ideas that would not otherwise be published. The American publication &quot;Bikini Kill&quot; (1990) introduced the Riot Grrrl Manifesto in their second issue as a way of establishing space. Zinesters Erika Reinstein and May Summer founded the Riot Grrrl Press to serve as a zine distribution network that would allow riot grrrls to &quot;express themselves and reach large audiences without having to rely on the mainstream press&quot;.

Women use this grassroots medium to discuss their personal lived experiences, and themes including body image, sexuality, gender norms, and violence to express anger, and reclaim/refigure femininity. Scholar and zinester Mimi Thi Nguyen notes that these norms unequally burdened riot grrrls of color with allowing white riot grrrls access to their personal experiences, an act which in itself was supposed to address systemic racism.

BUST - &quot;The voice of the new world order&quot; was created by Debbie Stoller, Laurie Hanzel and Marcelle Karp in 1993 to propose an alternate to the popular mainstream magazines Cosmopolitan and Glamour. Additional zines following this path are Shocking Pink (1981–82, 1987–92), Jigsaw (1988– ), Not Your Bitch 1989–1992 (Gypsy X, ed.) Bikini Kill (1990), Girl Germs (1990), Bamboo Girl (1995– ), BITCH Magazine (1996– ), Hip Mama (1997– ), Kitten Scratches (1999) and ROCKRGRL (1995–2005).

In the mid-1990s, zines were also published on the Internet as e-zines. Websites such as Gurl.com and ChickClick were created out of dissatisfaction of media available to women and parodied content found in mainstream teen and women&#x27;s magazines. Both Gurl.com and ChickClick had a message board and free web hosting services, where users could also create and contribute their own content, which in turn created a reciprocal relationship where women could also be seen as creators rather than consumers.

=== Commercialization ===
Starting in this decade, multinational companies started appropriating and commodifying zines and DIY culture. Their faux zines created a commercialized &quot;hipster&quot; lifestyle. By late in the decade, independent zinesters were accused of &quot;selling out&quot; to make a profit.

== Distribution and circulation ==
Zines are sold, traded or given as gifts at symposiums, publishing fairs, record and book stores and concerts, via independent media outlets, zine &#x27;distros&#x27;, mail order or through direct correspondence with the author. They are also sold online on distro websites, Etsy shops, blogs, or social networking profiles and are available for download. While zines are generally self-published, there are a few independent publishers who specialize in art zines such as Nieves Books in Zurich, founded by Benjamin Sommerhalder, and Café Royal Books founded by Craig Atkinson in 2005. In recent years a number of photocopied zines have risen to prominence or professional status and have found wide bookstore and online distribution. Notable among these are &quot;Giant Robot&quot;, &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot;, &quot;Bust&quot;, &quot;Bitch&quot;, &quot;Cometbus&quot;, &quot;Doris&quot;, &quot;Brainscan&quot;, The Miscreant, and &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot;.

Live map of zine distributors worldwide

There are many catalogued and online based mail-order distros for zines. The longest running distribution operation is Microcosm Publishing in Portland, Oregon. Some other longstanding operations include Great Worm Express Distribution in Toronto, CornDog Publishing in Ipswich in the UK, Café Royal Books in Southport in the UK, AK Press in Oakland, California, Missing Link Records in Melbourne. and Wasted Ink Zine Distro in Phoenix, AZ. 

=== Libraries and archives ===
A number of major public and academic libraries as well as museums carry zines and other small press publications, often with a specific focus (e.g. women&#x27;s studies) or those that are relevant to a local region.

Libraries and institutions with notable zine collections include:

* Barnard College Library
* The University of Iowa Special Collections
* The Sallie Bingham Center for Women&#x27;s History and Culture at Duke University
* The Tate Museum
* The British Library
* Harvard University&#x27;s Schlesinger Library
* Los Angeles Public Library
* San Francisco Public Library
* Jacksonville Public Library
* Interference Archive
* Anchor Archive Zine Library
* Toronto Zine Library
* Denver Zine Library

The Indie Photobook Library, an independent archive in the Washington, D.C., area, is a large collection of photo books and photo zines dating from 2008 to 2016 which the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Yale University acquired in 2016. In California, the Long Beach Public Library was the first public library in the state to start circulating zines for three weeks at a time in 2015. In 2017, the Los Angeles Public Library started to circulate zines publicly to its patrons as well. Both projects have been credited to librarian Ziba Zehdar, who has been an advocate in promoting public circulation of zines at libraries in California.

It has been suggested that the adoption of zine culture by powerful and prestigious institutions contradicts the function of zines as declarations of agency by marginalized groups.

=== Zine fests, workshops, and clubs ===

There has been a resurgence in the alternative publication culture beginning in the 2010s, in tandem with the influx of zine libraries and as a result of the digital age, which has sparked zine festivals across the globe. The San Francisco Zine Fest started in 2001 and features up to 200+ exhibitors, while the Los Angeles Zine Fest started in 2012 with only a handful of exhibitors, now hosting over 200 exhibitors. These are considered to be some of the biggest zine fests in the United States, Other big zine fests across the globe include, San Francisco Zine Fest, Brooklyn Zine Fest, Chicago Zine Fest, Feminist Zine Fest, Amsterdam Zine Jam, and Sticky Zine Fair. At each zine fest, the zinester can be their own independent distributor and publisher simply by standing behind a table to sell or barter their work. Over time, zinesters have added posters, stickers, buttons and patches to these events. In many libraries, schools and community centers around the world, zinesters hold meetings to create, share, and pass down the art of making zines.

== 2000s and the effect of the Internet ==
With the rise of the Internet in the mid-1990s, zines initially faded from public awareness; this is possibly due to the ability of private web-pages to fulfill much the same role of personal expression. Indeed, many zines were transformed into Webzines, such as &quot;Boing Boing&quot; or &quot;monochrom&quot;. The metadata standard for cataloging zines is &quot;xZineCorex&quot;, which maps to Dublin Core. E-zine creators were originally referred to as &quot;adopters&quot; because of their use of pre-made type and layouts, making the process less ambiguous. Since, social media, blogging and vlogging have adopted a similar do-it-yourself publication model.

In the UK &quot;Fracture&quot; and &quot;Reason To Believe&quot; were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, both ending in late 2003. &quot;Rancid News&quot; filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue &quot;Rancid News&quot; changed its name to &quot;Last Hours&quot; with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. &quot;Last Hours&quot; still operates as a webzine though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title. &quot;Artcore Fanzine&quot; (established in 1986) continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30-year anniversary issues.

Mira Bellwether&#x27;s zine &quot;Fucking Trans Women&quot;, published in 2010 online and 2013 in print, proved influential in the field of transgender sexuality, receiving both scholarly and popular-culture attention. It was described in &quot;Sexuality &amp; Culture&quot; as &quot;a comprehensive guide to trans women&#x27;s sexuality&quot; and &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; as &quot;the gold standard in transfeminine sex and masturbation&quot;.

In the early 2000s, zines with comics in them had a &quot;thriving&quot; fandom.

=== Television shows ===
Two popular kids shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s featured zine-making: &quot;Our Hero&quot; (2000–02) and &quot;Rocket Power&quot; (1999–2004). The main character in &quot;Our Hero&quot;, Kale Stiglic, writes about her life in the Toronto suburbs. The episodes are narrated and presented in the form of zine issues that she creates, inheriting her father&#x27;s storytelling passion. The show won titles from the Canadian Comedy Awards and Gemini Awards during its development.

<text>Colfax Avenue is the main street that runs east–west through the Denver metropolitan area in Colorado. As U.S. Highway 40, it was one of two principal highways serving Denver before the Interstate Highway System was constructed. In the local street system, it lies 15 blocks north of the zero meridian (Ellsworth Avenue, one block south of 1st Avenue), and would thus otherwise be known as 15th Avenue. The street was named for former Vice President Schuyler Colfax. At just under in length, it is known as the &quot;longest continuous commercial street in America&quot;.

==Geography==
From west to east, Colfax Avenue starts at Heritage Road in Golden as U.S. Highway 40 and the I-70 Business Loop, and continues east through Lakewood and enters Denver at Sheridan Boulevard. U.S. Highway 287 joins Colfax just west of I-25, and follows Colfax east through Denver and Aurora. In downtown Denver, near the Colorado State Capitol, the designation changes from West Colfax Avenue to East Colfax Avenue at the intersection with Broadway. It continues as East Colfax Avenue for the remainder of the route. In the eastern outskirts of Aurora, Colfax Avenue meets I-70 and the two U.S. highways follow the I-70 route eastward; signage at Picadilly Road and the frontage road is labeled Colfax Avenue. While appearing to be interrupted at the I-70 and Colfax Avenue interchange, Colfax Avenue has signage in the complex E-470 interchange, appearing as a frontage road of I-70 on most maps. This frontage road starts just west of the Colfax Avenue and I-70 interchange, and at an interchange (I-70 Exit 292), Colfax Avenue becomes State Highway 36 and continues east from Aurora through Bennett to end at Headlight Road in Strasburg.

Colfax Avenue cuts through Original Auraria, the city&#x27;s historic core, and skirts the southern edge of downtown Denver. Because of the dense, mixed-use character of the development along Colfax Avenue, the Regional Transportation District bus route &quot;15 - East Colfax&quot; has the highest ridership in the RTD system. In 2006, the first Colorado Colfax Marathon was held, traversing the length of Colfax Avenue through the three cities.

It&#x27;s become legend that &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine once called Colfax &quot;the longest, wickedest street in America&quot;, but attempts to source the actual quote have failed. However, such activities are actually isolated to short stretches of the length of the street. Periodically, Colfax undergoes redevelopment by the municipalities along its course that bring in new housing, businesses and restaurants. Some say that these new developments detract from the character of Colfax, while others worry that they cause gentrification and bring increased traffic to the area.

==History==

=== East Colfax ===

==== 1860–1890: Elite residential street ====
Colfax&#x27;s precursor, Grand Avenue, was established in along what was the southern boundary of central Denver. It was established as an east-west running baseline street along with the north-south running Broadway, to border new eastern and southern districts for the city. In 1868, Grand was renamed &quot;Colfax&quot; to honor U.S. House Speaker Schuyler Colfax who later became Ulysses Grant&#x27;s Vice President. Colfax had visited Denver in 1865, and locals may have named the street after him to gain national support from the prominent Indiana congressman for Colorado&#x27;s ongoing statehood initiative.

Denver&#x27;s population rapidly increased with the arrival of railroads, growing from 4,759 in 1870 to 106,713 in 1890. The area along Colfax developed unevenly: by the end of 1879, the area east of Broadway and north of Colfax was still mostly open prairie, but the area between Grant and Ogden Streets had become a prominent residential area. By 1887, residents and property owners along Colfax began pushing for better transportation options.

A cable railway was built in 1886 to connect Grant and Colfax with downtown Denver. The system was eventually replaced with streetcars, which facilitated more efficient transportation and encouraged development away from the city center. The construction of the State Capitol building in 1886 also had a positive impact on the development of the corridor, and by 1890, the Colfax Avenue Railway Company had extended its line to Montclair.

==== 1890–1910: Conversion to denser housing ====
The Panic of 1893 led to an economic depression in Denver, and many large houses along Colfax were converted into multi-family units. The once lavish and expensive homes along East Colfax and in Capitol Hill were no longer easy to maintain, and owners of the single-family mansions were forced to rent out rooms in their homes to temporary workers. As the economy recovered, apartment buildings were constructed, raising concerns among residents about the impact on property values and neighborhood quality. Three buildings still in existence from this early period are The Colonnade, Alta Court (formerly the Altamaha Apartment Building), and the Hamilton. The cultural and demographic shift, from single-family mansions toward boarding houses and rental property for the transient middle class, marked a shift in the demographics of East Colfax.

===== 1910–1940: Automobiles and commerce =====
The development of East Colfax was significantly influenced by the automobile, with the number of cars increasing exponentially from the mid-1910s to the 1920s. Increasing traffic led to the corridor becoming more commercial and the street was paved sometime prior to 1920. It part of the transcontinental U.S. Route 40 in the mid-1920s. Various groups sought to make East Colfax the best road in the state, transforming it into the gateway to Denver for tourists visiting by automobile from the East. It remained the gateway to Denver until i-70 was built in the 1950&#x27;s.

Denver&#x27;s 1925 zoning code designated most of East Colfax as commercial or business, and the city&#x27;s 1929 Master Plan acknowledged its transformation from a residential street to a business artery. This change led to a boom in commercial building construction in the 1920s, with various structures being erected along the avenue. While construction declined during the Great Depression and World War II, some commercial buildings and apartments continued to be built.

==== 1940s–present ====

East Colfax and Capitol Hill remained a solid middle-class neighborhood until the next demographic change occurred. After World War II, the mentality of many urban dwellers shifted. Mortgage lenders preferred new construction and there was a massive &quot;white flight&quot; to the suburbs. Families and the established middle class left Capitol Hill in a mass diaspora, selling off the family home to a developer interested in putting up a high-rise in its place or leaving the home abandoned. The demographics of people left behind were an underclass of transients and renters.

Also, the zoning along East Colfax has been badly planned for 50 years. In the 1950s East Colfax was rezoned B4, and the planners encouraged separation of uses and dependence on the automobile. Property owners along East Colfax found it much more rewarding to tear down an existing historic building and put up a new building in its place, rather than renovating. Planners and building officials encouraged this, for this was a time when old was considered ugly and new buildings meant progress.

In addition the zoning code from the 1950s, a 2:1 floor-area ratio (FAR) was adopted for East Colfax. These ratios determine the square footage of the building in relation to the lot size. Builders in the 1950s who tore down historic buildings along East Colfax for the purpose of developing a brand-new property were required to abide by the car-friendly codes and provide for automobile use.

As the feasibility study, &quot;East Colfax Avenue: An Opportunity and a Model for Development Action&quot;, claims about the streetscape of East Colfax, &quot;[East Colfax is designed to] encourage development of smaller parcels that lack frontage definition, have unevenly deep setback patterns and leave a large quantity of undeveloped space.&quot; This FAR almost single-handedly contributed to the architectural demise of East Colfax.

Phil Goodstein, a Denver historian, analyzes the effect of the FAR in his book, &quot;The Ghosts of Denver: Capitol Hill&quot;. &quot;Now the businesses were set back from the sidewalk with a parking lot between the store and the street. Every block, it seemed, became a parking lot while customers found it necessary to drive from one store to the next. Pedestrians had to dodge cars in the middle of the block... In light of this unpleasant walking atmosphere and Denver&#x27;s increasing addiction to the automobile, the number of people on the street declined. With this, the neighborhood became less safe.&quot; It was a steady downward spiral with many factors leading to what East Colfax is today, including the lack of interest in historic buildings and the myopic visions of the 1950s planners.

Another monumental watershed moment in the history of East Colfax Avenue was the completion of Interstate 70. No longer did incoming tourists drive down the thoroughfare on their way into downtown. The tourist dollar was effectively wiped out as a revenue source for East Colfax after this decade. So began another downward spiral. With no tourists to spend money along East Colfax the businesses suffered, as did the demand to go to Capitol Hill.

A factor in the increase in urban poor along Colfax has been linked to Denver Urban Renewal Authority&#x27;s plans for urban renewal in Downtown Denver. In the now-discredited belief that tearing down historic buildings and replacing them with modern architecture and high-rises would benefit cities, DURA bulldozed the bulk of Larimer Street in downtown. The urban poor that had been housed in Larimer Street&#x27;s single room occupancy buildings were now displaced to Colfax.

===West Colfax===

West Colfax Avenue began as a trail blazed during the Colorado Gold Rush, being a well-traveled direct route to the gold fields in the mountains. Historic media and other sources confirm its existence at least as far back as the spring of 1859, and it immediately became a major thoroughfare of goods, people and transportation service to and from the Colorado mountains. Soon it took on its original name, South Golden Road, as the southern road from Denver to Golden.

Originally West Colfax was configured with two major differences than how it exists today. It did not proceed past today&#x27;s intersection with Wide Acres Road, as originally Wide Acres and today&#x27;s South Golden (or Old Golden) roads were the continuation of the thoroughfare into Golden. Also, the road&#x27;s original route took it through the bed of present-day Sloan&#x27;s Lake, then a convenient swale for road travel. Stagecoach driver Bill Turner, who drove the route for the Central Overland California and Pike&#x27;s Peak Express, told the &quot;Colorado Transcript&quot; in 1909 how and when this changed:

The road for many years traveled over open prairie with various farms along the way. With the arrival of a tramway line running along West 13th Avenue, landowner William A. H. Loveland and others laid out the new city of Lakewood between Golden and Denver. The road, which soon became known as Colfax, became Lakewood&#x27;s main thoroughfare. Schuyler Colfax himself had actually once traveled this portion of the road named after him, when he was traveling by stagecoach with presidential candidate Ulysses S. Grant during a campaign getaway in 1868. In the meantime of the late 19th Century, the eastern end of West Colfax became home to numerous Jewish people of the Denver area. In 1898, Dr. Charles David Spivak, a noted Russian immigrant, physician and genealogist, established the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society to treat tuberculosis victims on a campus in today&#x27;s 6400 block of the road. This sanitorium treated victims of the White Plague who were too poor to pay or whose cases were too desperate to cure. The Golden Hill Cemetery was established at the western end of the road, divided into mainstream and the hill sections, the hill being the final resting place of victims who could not be cured. The hill section, as well as the JCRS campus, are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Around 1914 West Colfax was paved with concrete and designated a state highway, and it continued evolving into a major commercial thoroughfare of the region. During Prohibition it began showing signs of more colorful notoriety when scofflaw roadhouses such as Twilight Gardens operated along the thoroughfare. In 1937 the Works Progress Administration completely paved and modernized the highway, and built a new western route which took it over the hill and across ranch land to the entrance of Mt. Vernon Canyon, its present route. Around this time Colfax was designated U.S. Highway 40. From there on, commercial development boomed, including numerous motels, automobile dealerships, restaurants and more. After World War II it was a classic neon-lined highway for natives and travelers of its era; among its landmarks was Davies Chuck Wagon Diner, brought there in 1957 by restaurateur rancher Lyman Davies. The diner is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1956, two shopping malls, Westland and the JCRS Center, were built along Colfax, introducing major department stores and groceries to the area. At its far west end, at the base of the mountains, the Magic Mountain theme park was built, among the first of its kind in the world. The theme park, like many of its era, collapsed, but was resurrected in the 1970s as Heritage Square.

After the construction of nearby West 6th Avenue (U.S. Highway 6) and Interstate 70, West Colfax Avenue through Denver&#x27;s West Colfax Neighborhood, Northeast Lakewood, and Edgewater slowly declined and gained the seedy crime reputation and reality of its eastern counterpart. Since the 1970s, West Colfax Avenue through west Denver, Northeast Lakewood, Edgewater has had a high reputation and population of Mexican Americans as well as other Latino immigrants. During the 1990s, Lakewood began what has become a series of urban renewal and beautification efforts along the thoroughfare, from streetscaping to encouraging new proliferation of neon lighting to capitalize on its colorful past. Westland was rebuilt, and the JCRS Center also modified, but not so far as to eliminate the highly popular Casa Bonita restaurant which joined it in 1974. On the west end, the Stevinson family, who had originally built automobile dealerships there in the 1960s, built the new Denver West Village shopping center in 1997. In 2002 the Colorado Mills shopping center was built and opened across Colfax from there, the largest commercial development yet built on Colfax.

In the late 1990s the entirety of Colfax Avenue was designated a Colorado Heritage Corridor by the state government.

== Notable Establishments ==
=== Theatres ===
Colfax is a hub for live music and culture in Denver. A number of theaters actively operate on the street.

==== Ogden Theatre ====
The Ogden Theatre is a concert venue that has been a significant part of the city&#x27;s entertainment history since its founding as a silent-film theatre in 1917 by John Thompson and Henry Goodridge. It is one of the oldest still-operational theaters in Denver, and was designated a National Historical Place after its reopening in 1993 by current owner Doug Kauffman. The venue has hosted notable figures such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Prince, and has also played a role in the success of local bands like The Lumineers. Designed by architect Harry W.J. Edbrooke in a Mediterranean style, the theater has not only been a concert venue but also a silent film and vaudeville theater, and later a motion picture theater.

==== Bluebird Theatre ====
Built in 1913 as the Thompson Theatre, the Bluebird Theatre was given its current name by theatre mogul Harry Huffman in 1921. Huffman hosted a successful War Bonds contest during WWII, but the theater faced challenges in the post-war years, eventually screening low-budget and adult films until its closure in 1987. In 1994, Chris Swank and Evan Dechtman purchased the Bluebird and renovated it into a live music venue with tiered levels and a bar, aided by federal funding. AEG assumed control of the property in 2006. The Bluebird Theater is known for an intimate atmosphere and contributing to the cultural heritage of Colfax Avenue. Designed by architect Harry W.J.

<text>Forensic entomology is a branch of applied entomology that uses insects found on corpses or elsewhere around crime scenes in the interest of forensic science. This includes studying the types of insects commonly found on cadavers, their life cycles, their presence in different environments, and how insect assemblages change with decomposition.

Insect succession patterns are identified based on the time a species spends in each developmental stage and the number of generations produced since the insect&#x27;s introduction to a food source. By analyzing insect development alongside environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and vapor density, forensic entomologists can estimate the time since death, as flying insects are attracted to a body immediately after death. This field also provides clues about body movement after death and antemortem trauma. The primary goal is to determine the postmortem interval (PMI) to aid in death investigations.

Forensic entomology is also used in cases of neglect and abuse as toxicology to detect drugs and food contamination incidents. Insect assemblages can help approximate a body&#x27;s primary location, as some insects are unique to specific areas. Therefore, forensic entomology is divided into three subfields: urban, stored-product and medico-legal/medico-criminal entomology.

==History==
Historically, several accounts of applications have been for, and experimentation with, forensic entomology. Aside from an initial case report in China from the 13th century, the primitive observation and correlation between arthropods and forensic contexts has been documented in Germany and France. This observation was conducted during a mass exhumation in the late 1880s by Hofmann and Reinhard. However, only in the last 30 years has forensic entomology been systematically explored as a feasible source for evidence in criminal investigations. Through documented experiments and focus on arthropods and death, the works of Sung Tzu, Francesco Redi, Bergeret d&#x27;Arbois, Jean Pierre Mégnin and the physiologist Hermann Reinhard form the foundations for today&#x27;s modern forensic entomology.

===Song Ci===
The Song dynasty (960–1279) forensic science book &quot;Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified&quot; published by a court judge, physician, medical scientist, and writer Song Ci in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology. In a murder case of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a sickle; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved. The local magistrate had the villagers assemble in the town square, where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and no others, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as authorities detained him.

Song Ci (sometimes called Sung Tzu) was a judicial intendant who lived in China from 1188 to 1251 AD. In 1247 AD, Song Ci wrote a book entitled &quot;Washing Away of Wrongs&quot; as a coroner handbook. In this book Song Ci depicts several cases in which he took notes on how a person died and elaborates on probable cause. He explains in detail how to examine a corpse before and after burial. He also explains the process of how to determine a probable cause of death. The main purpose of this book was to be used as a guide for other investigators so they could assess the crime scene effectively. His level of detail in explaining what he observed in all his cases laid down the fundamentals for modern forensic entomologists. He is the first recorded account of someone using forensic entomology for judicial means.

===Francesco Redi===

In 1668, Italian physician Francesco Redi disproved the theory of spontaneous generation. This was the accepted theory of Redi&#x27;s day, and it claimed that maggots developed spontaneously from rotting meat. In an experiment, Redi used samples of rotting meat that were either fully exposed to the air, partially exposed to the air, or not exposed to the air. Redi showed that both fully and partially exposed rotting meat developed fly maggots, whereas rotting meat not exposed to air did not develop maggots. This discovery completely changed how people viewed organisms&#x27; decomposition and prompted further investigations into insect life cycles and entomology in general.

===Bergeret d&#x27;Arbois===
Dr. Louis François Etienne Bergeret (1814–1893) was a French hospital physician and was the first to apply forensic entomology to a case. In a case report published in 1855, he stated a general life cycle for insects and made many assumptions about their mating habits. Nevertheless, these assumptions led him to the first application of forensic entomology in an estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI). His report used forensic entomology as a tool to prove his hypothesis on how and when the person had died.

===Hermann Reinhard===
The first systematic study in forensic entomology was conducted in 1881 by Hermann Reinhard, a German medical doctor. He exhumed many bodies and demonstrated that the development of many different insect species could be tied to buried bodies. Reinhard conducted his first study in East Germany and collected many Phorid flies there. He concluded that the development of only some of the insects living near corpses underground was associated directly with decaying flesh since there were 15-year-old beetles who had little direct contact with the bodies. Reinhard&#x27;s works and studies were used extensively in further forensic entomology studies.

===Jean Pierre Mégnin===

French veterinarian and entomologist Jean Pierre Mégnin (1828–1905) published many articles and books on various subjects, including the books &quot;Faune des Tombeaux&quot; and &quot;La Faune des Cadavres&quot;, which are considered to be among the most important forensic entomology books in history. In his second book he did revolutionary work on the theory of predictable waves, or successions of insects onto corpses. By counting numbers of live and dead mites every 15 days and comparing the data with his initial count on the infant, he was able to estimate how long the infant had been dead.

In this book, he asserted that exposed corpses were subject to eight successional waves, whereas buried corpses were only subject to two waves. Mégnin made many great discoveries that helped shed new light on many of the general characteristics of decaying flora and fauna. Mégnin&#x27;s work and study of the larval and adult forms of insect families found in cadavers sparked the interest of future entomologists and encouraged more research in the link between arthropods and the deceased, and thereby helped to establish the scientific discipline of forensic entomology.

==Subfields==

===Urban===
Urban forensic entomology typically concerns pest infestations in buildings, gardens, or other urban environments, and may be the basis of litigation between private parties and service providers such as landlords or exterminators For instance, urban forensic entomology can be used to evaluate the efficiency of pest control techniques, ascertain the size of an infestation, and identify the responsible party in situations involving infestations in rental homes. Urban forensic entomology studies may also indicate the fitness of certain pesticide treatments. Urban forensic entomology can also assist in determining liability when stored goods, like grains or packaged foods, are contaminated with insects, helping to identify the infestation&#x27;s origin. These techniques may be used in stored products cases where they can help to determine the chain of custody, when all points of possible infestation onset are examined to determine who is at fault. Moreover, environmental management and public health depend heavily on urban forensic entomology. Researchers can track the transmission of disease carried by insects by examining insect populations in urban settings. Forensic techniques can also guide conservation efforts by evaluating the environmental effects of urbanization on insect populations.

===Stored-product===
Stored-product forensic entomology is often used in litigation over insect infestation or contamination of commercially distributed foods, including grains, flour, and packaged meals. Stored-product forensic entomologists may be asked to identify the bug species involved, evaluate the extent of an infestation, and pinpoint the infestation&#x27;s source in a legal proceeding. They might offer expert testimony about the circumstances that gave rise to the infestation and suggest safeguards to prevent similar risks in the future.

Forensic entomology on stored products both adds critical evidence to legal evaluation and contributes to overall food safety and quality assurance. Forensic entomologists work to guarantee that food products are safe for consumption by identifying insect species and tracking their presence in stored goods. Additionally, this sector contributes to the general enhancement of food business practices by researching and developing novel techniques for pest management and product preservation.

===Medico-legal===
Medico-legal forensic entomology involves the study of arthropods found at the scene of various incidents such as murder, suicide, rape, physical abuse and contraband trafficking. Forensic investigators can learn important details from insect activities, including the length of time passed since death, the presence of medication or toxins in the body, and the movement or disturbance of the body following death. In murder investigations, forensic entomologists analyze which insect&#x27;s eggs appear, their location on human remains, and their development stage to determine the PMI and the location of death. The presence of specific insect species, which may exhibit endemism (occurring only in certain places) or a well-defined phenology (active only at a certain season, or time of day), in association with other evidence can provide crucial links to times and locations where other criminal acts may have occurred. This discipline provides techniques to associate a victim, suspect and scene together by identifying different insect species found in specific geographical locations.

Another area covered by medico-legal forensic entomology is the relatively new field of entomotoxicology. This particular branch involves testing entomological specimens found at a scene for different drugs that may have possibly played a role in the death of the victim. The analytical perspective behind these methods relies upon the fact that the presence of drugs within the carcass specifically effects the growth and morphology of the insects ingesting those toxins from the corpse. Due to these alterations, the presence of drugs can potentially lead to an erroneous PMI when basing it on the abnormal physical development of insects who have fed on them.

Entomology can aid in medico-legal cases when determining the time of an injury. One determining factor might be the observed species&#x27; preference of alimentation. When eggs laid on a corpse by blow flies subsequently hatch into first instar (first stage larvae), they require a liquid protein meal. Due to their minute size and fragility blowflies are unable to break through human skin themselves to attain this nutrition. Therefore, the female typically oviposits near a pre-existing wound or natural orifice to provide accessible blood, a mucosal layer and body fluids for her offspring to eat.

=== Myiasis ===
Myiasis, the infestation of living vertebrate animals with dipteran larvae (ex: blowfly maggots), is a phenomenon that may be noted in cases of abandonment or neglect. This condition occurs when flies colonize a living human or animal, feeding on the organism&#x27;s accessible living tissues, ingesting food or bodily fluids. In a forensic context, myasis can be confusing, as it may indicate the time of neglect or injury rather than PMI if the victim or remains were colonized when alive and prior to discovery. This highlights the importance of careful interpretation of all evidence in forensic investigation.

== Role of insects in decomposition ==
Insect activities are essential to the breakdown of organic materials, including human remains. Chemicals emitted during decomposition attract necrophilic insects, those that feed on dead creatures. These insects hasten the decomposition process by aiding in the breakdown of bodily tissues. Among the first insects to reach a body, blow flies are classified as primary colonizers. Their oviposited eggs are laid in natural openings, wounds, or damp places, and decaying tissues are consumed by their maggot larvae. By feeding on the remnants, other arthropods like mites and beetles may also aid in the decomposition process.

==Invertebrate types==
===Scorpionflies===

Scorpionflies (order Mecoptera) were the first insects to arrive at a donated human cadaver observed (by the entomologist Natalie Lindgren) at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility near Huntsville, Texas, and remained on the corpse for one and a half days, outnumbering flies during that period. A great presence of scorpionflies may indicate a shorter postmortem interval.

===Flies===

Flies from the order Diptera are often found at a crime scene, because they are attracted to the chemicals released by decomposing bodies, known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A dead body is a perfect environment for oviposition, the laying of eggs. The developing maggots will have a ready food source. Different types of flies can be found on dead bodies, the most significant of which are:
* Blow flies – Family Calliphoridae- Flies in this family are often metallic in appearance and between 10 and 14 mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as blue bottle fly, cluster flies, greenbottles, or black blowfly. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. Larvae have three stages of development (called instars); each stage is separated by a molting event. Molting can be defined as the process of new cuticle production while subsequently shedding the old cuticle. Larvae&#x27;s ideal habitat in regard to pupation are locations providing access to loose, damp soil and litter. The latter consists of temperate and rather tropical areas. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the Neotropics, and a large number of species in Africa and Southern Europe. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of India, Japan, Central America, and in the southern United States. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first insect to come in contact with carrion because they have the ability to smell death from up to away. Some prominent species of Calliphoridae are &quot;Calliphora vomitoria&quot; and &quot;Calliphora vicina.&quot;
*Flesh flies – Family Sarcophagidae- Most flesh flies breed in carrion, dung, garbage, or decaying material, but a few species lay their eggs in the open wounds of mammals; hence their common name. Characteristics of the flesh-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Most holarctic Sarcophagidae vary in size from 4 to 18 mm in length (Tropical species can be larger) with black and gray longitudinal stripes on the thorax and checkering on the abdomen. Flesh-flies, being viviparous, frequently give birth to live young on corpses of human and other animals, at any stage of decomposition, from newly dead through to bloated or decaying (though the latter is more common). &quot;Sarcophaga barbata&quot; are specifically useful since they deposit maggots directly onto the decomposing body, their larger, visible size, and difference in activity during different stages. Their main limitation, however, is due to lack of information surrounding their geographic distribution and taxonomic features.

*House fly – Family Muscidae- is the most common of all flies found in homes, and indeed one of the most widely distributed insects; it is often considered a pest that can carry serious diseases. The adults are 6–9 mm long. Their thorax is gray, with four longitudinal dark lines on the back. The underside of their abdomen is yellow, and their whole body is covered with hair. Each female fly can lay up to 500 eggs in several batches of about 75 to 150 eggs. Genus &quot;Hydrotaea&quot; are of particular forensic importance.
*Cheese flies – Family Piophilidae - Most are scavengers in animal products and fungi. The best-known member of the family is &quot;Piophila casei&quot;. It is a small fly, about four mm (1/6 inch) long, found worldwide. This fly&#x27;s larva infests cured meats, smoked fish, cheeses, and decaying animals and is sometimes called the cheese skipper for its leaping ability. Forensic entomology uses the presence of Piophila casei larvae to help estimate the date of death for human remains. They do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death. The adult fly&#x27;s body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly iridescent and lie flat upon the fly&#x27;s abdomen when at rest. At four mm (1/6 inch) long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common housefly.
*Coffin flies – Phoridae – a/k/a Humpbacked flies - Larvae feed on decaying bodies. Some species can burrow to a depth of 50 cm over 4 days. Important in buried bodies.
*Lesser corpse flies – Sphaeroceridae.
*Lesser house flies – Fanniidae.
*Black scavenger flies – Sepsidae.
*Sun flies - Heleomyzidae.
*Black soldier fly - Stratiomyidae - have potential for use in forensic entomology. The larvae are common scavengers in compost heaps, are found in association with carrion, can be destructive pests in honey bee hives, and are used in manure management (for both house fly control and reduction in manure volume). The larvae range in size from 1/8 to 3/4 of an inch (3 to 19 millimeters). The adult fly is a mimic, very close in size, color, and appearance to the organ pipe mud dauber wasp and its relatives.
*Non-biting midges - Chironomidae - these flies have a complex life cycle. While adults are terrestrial and phytophagous, larvae are aquatic and detritivorous. Immature instars have been used as forensic markers in several cases where submerged corpses were found.

===Beetles===

Beetles (Order Coleoptera) are generally found in later stages of decomposition. They play a role in breaking down the remaining tissue and are important in the final stages of decomposition. In drier conditions, the beetles can be replaced by moth flies (Psychodidae). Their life cycle normally consists of four stages : eggs, larval, pupal, and adult. Each stage has unique eating behavior that changes as the organism breaks down. In forensic investigations, the existence and developmental phases of insects can yield important data for understanding environmental circumstances, body movement, and postmortem interval (PMI) estimation. In forensic entomology, insects play a crucial function as indicators, helping to identify vital components of a death investigation due to their distinct ecological responsibilities and varied geographic distribution. Different types of beetles can be found on dead bodies the most significant include:
* Rove beetles – family Staphylinidae – are elongate beetles with small elytra (wing covers) and large jaws. Rove beetles have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larvae, pupa and adult. &quot;Creophilus&quot; species are common predators of carrion, and since they are large, are a very visible component of the fauna of corpses. Some adult Staphylinidae are early visitors to a corpse, feeding on larvae of all species of fly, including the later predatory fly larvae. They lay their eggs in the corpse, and the emerging larvae are also predators. Some species have a long development time in the egg, and are common only during the later stages of decomposition. Staphylinids can also tear open the pupal cases of flies, to sustain themselves at a corpse for long periods.
*Hister beetles – family Histeridae. Adult histerids are usually shiny beetles (black or metallic-green) which have an introverted head. The carrion-feeding species only become active at night when they enter the maggot-infested part of the corpse to capture and devour their maggot prey. During daylight they hide under the corpse unless it is sufficiently decayed to enable them to hide inside it. They have fast larval development with only two larval stages. Among the first beetles to arrive at a corpse are Histeridae of the genus &quot;Saprinus&quot;. &quot;Saprinus&quot; adults feed on both the larvae and pupae of blowflies, although some have a preference for fresh pupae. The adults lay their eggs in the corpse, inhabiting it in the later stages of decay.
*Carrion beetles – family Silphidae- Adult Silphidae have an average size of about 12 mm. They are also referred to as burying beetles because they dig and bury small carcasses underground. Both parents tend to their young and exhibit communal breeding. The male carrion beetle&#x27;s job in care is to provide protection for the breed and carcass from competitors. &quot;Necrodes littoralis&quot; is a type of carrion beetle in the Silphidae family that prefers to inhabit bodies that are outdoors and in the later stages of decomposition. Modeling the activity and behaviors of carrion beetles like &quot;N. littoralis&quot; and other carrion beetles that inhbait bodies earlier in death is a helpful tool to map time of death.
*Ham beetles – family Cleridae.
*Carcass beetles – family Trogidae.
*Skin/hide beetles – family Dermestidae. Hide beetles are important in the final stages of decomposition of a carcass. The adults and larvae feed on the dried skin, tendons and bone left by fly larvae. Hide beetles are the only beetle with the enzymes necessary for breaking down keratin, a protein component of hair.
*Scarab beetles – family Scarabaeidae- Scarab beetles may be any one of around 30,000 beetle species worldwide that are compact, heavy-bodied and oval in shape. The flattened plates, which each antenna terminates, are fitted together to form a club. The outer edges of the front legs may also be toothed or scalloped. Scarab beetles range from in length. These species are known for being one of the heaviest insect species.
*Sap beetles – family Nitidulidae.

===Mites===

Many mites (class Acari, not insects) feed on corpses with &quot;Macrocheles&quot; mites common in the early stages of decomposition, while Tyroglyphidae and Oribatidae mites such as Rostrozetes feed on dry skin in the later stages of decomposition.

&quot;Nicrophorus&quot; beetles often carry on their bodies the mite &quot;Poecilochirus&quot; which feed on fly eggs. If they arrive at the corpse before any fly eggs hatch into maggots, the first eggs are eaten and maggot development is delayed. This may lead to incorrect PMI estimates. &quot;Nicrophorus&quot; beetles find the ammonia excretions of blowfly maggots toxic, and the &quot;Poecilochirus&quot; mites, by keeping the maggot population low, allow &quot;Nicrophorus&quot; to occupy the corpse.

===Moths===

Moths (order Lepidoptera) specifically clothes-moths – Family Tineidae – are closely related to butterflies. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are crepuscular and diurnal species. During their larval stages, clothes moths tend to feed on mammalian hair. They are amongst the final animals contributing to the decomposition of a corpse. This said, adult moths lay their legs on a carcass &quot;subsequently&quot; to fly larvae having had their presence on it.

===Wasps, ants, and bees===

Wasps, ants, and bees (order Hymenoptera) are not necessarily necrophagous. While some feed on the body, some are also predatory, and eat the insects feeding on the body. Thus meaning they are parasitoids (Parasitoid wasp). These Hymenoptera lay their eggs within the eggs or pupae of other insects; essentially causing the death of host insects. Wasps can also be of association to the family Pteromalidae. The latter can lay single or multiple eggs. They oviposit in pupae of muscoid flies (blow flies). Subsequently, to the wasp eggs hatching, larvae will feed on the fly developing within the puparium; leading to its death. Bees and wasps have been seen feeding on the body during the early stages. This may cause problems for murder cases in which larval flies are used to estimate the post mortem interval since eggs and larvae on the body may have been consumed prior to the arrival on scene of investigators.

== Insect succession ==

Insect succession, as utilized in forensic entomology, refers to the orderly progression of insect colonization and decomposition processes on a corpse over time. Their life cycle typically consists of four stages : eggs, larval, pupal, and adult. Each stage has unique eating behavior that changes as the organism breaks down. In forensic investigations, the presence and developmental phases of insects can provide important data for understanding environmental circumstances, body movement, and postmortem interval (PMI) estimation. In forensic entomology, insects play a crucial role as indicators, helping to identify key components of a death investigation due to their distinct ecological responsibilities and varied geographic distribution. Given that different insect species inhabit a body in a certain order, understanding insect succession is essential for predicting the postmortem interval (PMI). Typically, insect succession occurs in the following stages:
# Fresh stage: Marked by the arrival of necrophagous insects attracted to the body by chemicals, such as flesh flies and blowflies. These insects deposit their eggs (oviposit) on or near to the body, and the decaying tissues are the maggot&#x27;s food source.
# Bloated stage: The body starts to swell as a result of gas buildup during the breakdown process. During this phase, insects such as cheese skipper and coffin flies become more common.
# Decay stage: In this stage, the insect community changes as the body goes through a more advanced state of decomposition. Predatory insects and mites increase in number, as do beetles, such as dermestid beetles and rove beetles.
# Dry stage: The body dries up and the skeletal remains become visible during the last phases of decomposition. Scavenger insects and animals may be present on the remains, along with insects like ham beetles and hide beetles.

== Postmortem interval estimation ==

A crucial component of forensic entomology is the calculation of the postmortem interval (PMI), which mostly depends on the observation of the insect activity on a corpse. Using the life stages of insects discovered on or near a body, forensic entomologists can reasonably determine how long it has been since a person died.

The pace of insect colonization and development is influenced by a number of variables, including as temperature, humidity, the presence of other living things and others. The accumulated degree hour (ADH) approach, which determines the total amount of heat energy generated by a body since death, is one of the models and methodologies used by forensic entomologists to estimate the PMI.

Even through PMI estimation based on insect evidence is typically accurate, it is crucial to take into account additional elements including body position, ambient circumstances and insect behavior that may have an impact on insect activity.

==Factors==

=== Moisture levels ===
Both the decomposition and insect activity on a corpse are significantly influenced by humidity. Elevated humidity can hasten the decomposition process by fostering microbial proliferation, which facilitates the breakdown of tissues. Additionally the odors and gases produced by this microbial activity draw insects to the body. These smells are particularly attractive to insects like blowflies and flesh flies, which may quickly populate a body in humid conditions.

Low humidity, on the other hand, can impede the breakdown process. Mummification rather that breakdown may result from the body losing moisture more quickly in arid settings. Given that many insects need damp atmosphere to survive, this may discourage their activity. Nonetheless, some insects, like dermestid beetles, can survive in dry environments and can still be found on a body.

The existence of standing water next to a body can also affect the activity of insects. Aquatic insects, such as water beetles and some fly species, may be drawn to bodies near water sources. These insects can colonize the body and hasten its decomposition. Furthermore, because different insect species have distinct preference for habitats, the presence of water might influence the kinds of insects that inhabits the body.

All things considered, the rate and pattern of a corpse&#x27;s decomposition and insect colonization are greatly influenced by its humidity. To estimate the postmortem period and reconstruct the circumstances around a death, forensic entomologists can benefit from an understanding of how humidity levels affect decomposition.

===Submerged corpses===
M. Lee Goff, a noted and well respected forensic entomologist, was assigned to a case involving the discovery of a decomposing body found on a boat half a mile from shore. Upon collection of the maggot mass, only one insect, &quot;Chrysomya megacephala&quot;, was discovered. He concluded that the water barrier accounted for the scarcity of other flies. He also noted that flies will not attempt to trek across large bodies of water unless there is a substantially influential attractant.

In addition, the amount of time a maggot mass has been exposed to salt water can affect its development. From the cases Goff observed he found that if subjected for more than 30 minutes, there was a 24‑hour developmental delay. Not many more studies have been conducted and thus a specific amount of delay time is difficult to estimate.

The main focus of a study accomplished by Payne and King using fetal pigs, was the insect succession regarding carcass decomposition in an aquatic setting. Their results concluded that in the early floating stages of the cadaver, eggs were laid by blowflies. Moreover, by the bloating stage, most of the exposed flesh was absent and maggots migrated from the body. Many of the latter were present below the water line and fed on the carcass; with only their Spiracle (arthropods) protruding the surface.

===Sun exposure===
&quot;Because insects are cold-blooded animals, their rate of development is more or less dependent on ambient temperature.&quot;
Bodies exposed to large amounts of sunlight will heat up, giving the insects a warmer area to develop, reducing their development time.
An experiment conducted by Bernard Greenberg and John Charles Kunich with the use of rabbit carcasses to study accumulation of degree days found that with temperature ranging in the mid 70s to high 80s the amount of developmental time for maggots was significantly reduced.

In contrast, bodies found in shaded areas will be cooler, and insects will require longer growth periods. In addition, if temperatures reach extreme levels of cold, insects instinctively know to prolong their development time in order to hatch into a more accepting and viable climate in order to increase the chance of survival and reproduction.

Furthermore, insect activity and colonization patterns can also be influenced by the length and intensity of solar exposure. Because the increasing temperature speeds up their development, insects are more likely to be active and colonize a body more quickly in places exposed to direct and extended sunlight. In comparison to shaded locations, this may result in a quicker succession of insect life and disintegration stages. On the other hand, because of the lower temperatures, shaded areas might have slower rates of insect activity and decomposition, which would delay the processes of insect colonization and decomposition.

===Air exposure===
Air exposure can have a significant impact on insects and the determination of postmortem interval (PMI). Hanged bodies can be expected to show their own quantity and variety of flies. Also, the amount of time flies will stay on a hanged body will vary in comparison to one found on the ground. A hanged body is more exposed to air and thus will dry out faster, leaving less food source for the maggots.

The presence and behavior of insects on hanging bodies can vary. As the body begins to decompose, a compilation of fluids will leak to the ground. This area is where most of the expected fauna can be found. Also, it is more likely that rove beetles and other non-flying insects will be found here instead of directly on the body. Fly maggots, initially deposited on the body, may also be found below.

===Geography===
According to Jean Pierre Mégnin&#x27;s book &quot;La Faune des Cadavres&quot; there are eight distinct faunal successions attracted to a corpse. While most beetles and flies of forensic importance can be found worldwide, a portion of them are limited to a specific range of habitats. It is forensically important to know the geographical distribution of these insects in order to determine information such as post mortem interval or whether a body has been moved from its original place of death.

Calliphoridae is arguably the most important family concerning forensic entomology given that they are the first to arrive on the corpse. The family can be found worldwide. &quot;Chrysomya rufifaces&quot;, the hairy maggot blow fly, is a forensically important member of the family Calliphoridae and is widespread, however it is not prevalent in the Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Florida, or Illinois regions.

Flesh flies fall under the family Sacrophagidae and generally arrive at a corpse following Calliphoridae. Unlike Calliphoridae, however, members of this family are able to fly in heavy rain. This key advantage enables them to occasionally reach a body before Calliphoridae, affecting the maggot mass that will be discovered. Flesh flies are globally distributed including habitats in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

Beetles are representative of the order Coleoptera which accounts for the largest of the insect orders. Beetles are very adaptive and can be found in almost all environments with the exception of Antarctica and high mountainous regions. The most diverse beetle fauna can be found in the tropics. In addition, beetles are less submissive to temperatures. Thus, if a carcass has been found in cold temperatures, the beetle will be prevalent over Calliphoridae.

===Weather===
Various weather conditions in a given amount of time cause certain pests to invade human households. This is because the insects are in search of food, water, and shelter.
Damp weather causes reproduction and growth enhancement in many insect types, especially when coupled with warm temperatures. Most pests concerned at this time are ants, spiders, crickets, cockroaches, ladybugs, yellowjackets, hornets, mice, and rats.
When conditions are dry, the deprivation of moisture outside drives many pests inside searching for water. While the rainy weather increases the numbers of insects, this dry weather causes pest invasions to increase. The pests most commonly known during dry conditions are scorpions, ants, pillbugs, millipedes, crickets, and spiders. Extreme drought does kill many populations of insects, but also drives surviving insects to invade more often.
Cold temperatures outside will cause invasions beginning in the late summer months and early fall. Box elder bugs, cluster flies, ladybugs, and silverfish are noticed some of the most common insects to seek the warm indoors. In general, insects are poikilothermic animals; thus meaning their level of activity is substantially depended upon their surrounding environmental conditions. An increase in the temperature will result in an accelerated metabolism of the insect; hence resulting in an increased activity.

==Modern techniques==
Many new techniques have been developed and are used in order to more accurately gather evidence, or reevaluate old information. The use of these newly developed techniques and evaluations have become relevant in litigation and appeals. Forensic entomology not only uses arthropod biology, but it pulls from other sciences, introducing fields like chemistry and genetics, exploiting their inherent synergy through the use of DNA in forensic entomology. In order to improve the precision and dependability of insect-based evidence analysis, forensic entomologists nowadays use a variety of cutting-edge technologies, such as stable isotope analysis and DNA analysis. These methods have broadened the field of forensic entomology by making it possible to identify insect species more precisely, pinpoint their geographic origins, and draw important conclusions about the circumstances surrounding a death. Some of the most important contemporary forensic entomology techniques are examined in this section along with how they are applied to criminal investigations.

===Scanning electron microscopy===
Fly larvae and fly eggs are used to aid in the determination of a PMI. In order for the data to be useful the larvae and eggs must be identified down to a species level to get an accurate estimate for the PMI. There are many techniques currently being developed to differentiate between the various species of forensically important insects. A study in 2007 demonstrates a technique that can use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify key morphological features of eggs and maggots. Some of the morphological differences that can help identify the different species are the presence/absence of anastomosis, the presence/absence of anterior and posterior spiracles, the cephalopharyngeal skeleton as well as the shape and length of the median area.

The SEM method provides an array of morphological features for use in identifying fly eggs; however, this method does have some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that it requires expensive equipment and can take time to identify the species from which the egg originated, so it may not be useful in a field study or to quickly identify a particular egg.
The SEM method is effective provided there is ample time and the proper equipment and the particular fly eggs are plentiful. The ability to use these morphological differences gives forensic entomologists a powerful tool that can help with estimating a post mortem interval, along with other relevant information, such as whether the body has been disturbed post mortem.

===Potassium permanganate staining===
When scanning electron microscopy is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is potassium permanganate staining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a normal saline solution and placed in a glass petri dish. The eggs are soaked in a 1% potassium permanganate solution for one minute and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation. These slides can be used with any light microscope with a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the plastron, as well as the morphology of the plastron in the area around the micropyle. The various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.

===Mitochondrial DNA===
In 2001, a method was devised by Jeffrey Wells and Felix Sperling to use mitochondrial DNA to differentiate between different species of the subfamily Chrysomyinae. This is particularly useful when working to determine the identity of specimens that do not have distinctive morphological characteristics at certain life stages.

===Mock crime scenes===
A valuable tool that is becoming very common in the training of forensic entomologists is the use of mock crime scenes using pig carcasses. The pig carcass represents a human body and can be used to illustrate various environmental effects on both arthropod succession and the estimate of the post mortem interval. Pigs are the most frequently utilised model in an attempt to gather data regarding forensic experimental analysis. The latter is highly proportionate to human nature due to our overlapping characteristics with the mentioned species. These interrelated components include: subcutaneous fat stores, skin thickness, range of adult body mass, hair covering, and omnivorous diets.

===Gene expression studies===
Although physical characteristics and sizes at various instars have been used to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because they are likely to be in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. The hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.

=== DNA analysis ===
Modern forensic entomology now relies heavily on DNA analysis as a fundamental tool for accurately identifying insect species and gaining important insights into their interactions with human remains. Using this method, DNA is extracted from insect specimens discovered at crime scenes and compared to databases containing known DNA sequences. Forensic entomologists can verify species identification, identify the existence of particular species linked to decomposition, and even establish a connection between insects and particular geographical areas through the examination of insect DNA.

The identification of insect stomach contents is one of the main uses of DNA analysis in forensic entomology. Investigators can ascertain the insect&#x27;s most recent meal by sequencing the DNA contained in the gut of maggots or other insect larvae discovered on a body. When determining the postmortem interval (PMI) or locating possible sources of contamination or infection, this information might be extremely important.

The study of insect dispersal patterns and colonization behaviour has also been transformed by DNA research. Researchers can deduce patterns of travel and colonization by examining the genetic variety of insect populations. This can provide important insights into the origin of insect specimens found at crime scenes or the transportation of a body.

In general, DNA analysis has improved forensic entomology&#x27;s accuracy and dependability significantly, allowing investigators to obtain previously unobtainable specific information from insect evidence.

=== Stable isotope analysis ===
A contemporary method that is being used more and more in forensic entomology to shed light on the ecology and life cycle of insects connected to human remains is stable isotope analysis. Using this technique, the stable isotopic composition of elements found in insect tissues, including carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, is measured. The environment in which the insect developed, including its diet and place of origin, is reflected in these isotopes.

Stable isotope analysis provides information on the travel of the body or the insect itself, and can be used in forensic investigations to assist identify the geographic origin of insects found on a body. Furthermore, features of the insect&#x27;s diet, such as whether it consumed organic matter or human remains, can be inferred by stable isotope analysis. This information can be vital to comprehending the insect&#x27;s function in the decomposition process.

When using traditional methods to identify insect species or estimate age, this methodology has proven quite helpful. Stable isotope analysis contributes to more accurate and thorough forensic studies by improving the precision and depth of forensic entomological investigations by offering a distinct chemical signature that represents the insect&#x27;s surroundings.

==Insect activity case study==
A preliminary investigation of insect colonization and succession on remains in New Zealand revealed the following results on decay and insect colonization.

===Open field habitat===
This environment had a daily average maximum temperature of and a daily minimum temperature of . The average rainfall for the first 3 weeks in this environment was 3.0 mm/day. Around days 17–45, the body began to start active decay. During this stage, the insect successions started with &quot;Calliphora stygia&quot;, which lasted until day 27. The larvae of &quot;Chrysomya rufifacies&quot; were present between the day 13 and day 47. &quot;Hydrotaea rostrata&quot;, larvae of &quot;Lucilia sericata&quot;, family Psychodidae, and &quot;Sylvicola&quot; were found to be present relatively late in the body&#x27;s decay.

===Coastal sand-dune habitat===
This environment had an average daily maximum temperature of and minimum of . The daily average rainfall was recorded as 1.4 mm/day for the first 3 weeks. The post-decay time interval, beginning at day six after death and ending around day 15 after death, is greatly reduced from the average post-decay time, due to the high average temperature of this environment. Insects obtained late in the post-active stage include the &quot;Calliphora quadrimaculata&quot;, adult Sphaeroceridae, Psychodidae and Piophilidae (no larvae from this last family were obtained in recovery).

===Native bush habitat===
This environment had recorded daily average maximum and minimum temperatures were , respectively. The average rainfall in this habitat was recorded at 0.4 mm/day. After the bloat stage, which lasted until day seven after death, post-active decay began around day 14. In this habitat, the &quot;H. rostrata&quot;, adult Phoridae, Sylvicola larvae and adult were the predominant species remaining on the body during the pre-skeletonization stages.

==In literature==
Over time, the study of forensic entomology evolved from an esoteric science reserved only for entomologists and forensic scientists.
Early twentieth-century popular scientific literature began to pique a broader interest in entomology. The very popular ten-volume book series, Alfred Brehem&#x27;s &quot;Thierleben&quot; (Life of Animals, 1876–1879) expounded on many zoological topics, including the biology of arthropods. The accessible writing style of French entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre was also instrumental to the popularization of entomology. His collection of writings &quot;Souvenirs Entomologique&quot;, written during the last half of the 19th century, is especially useful because of the meticulous attention to detail to the observed insects&#x27; behaviors and life cycles.

The real impetus behind the modern cultural fascination with solving crime using entomological evidence can be traced back to the works &quot;Faune des Tombeaux&quot; (Fauna of the Tombs, 1887) and &quot;Les Faunes des Cadavres&quot; (Fauna of Corpses, 1894) by French veterinarian and entomologist Jean Pierre Mégnin. These works made the concept of the process of insect ecological succession on a corpse understandable and interesting to an ordinary reader in a way that no other previous scientific work had done. It was after the publication of Mégnin&#x27;s work that the studies of forensic science and entomology became an established part of Western popular culture, which in turn inspired other Western scientists to continue and expand upon his research.

<doc id="61296" wikidata="Q187471" url="?curid=61296" title="Ithaca (island)">
<text>Ithaca, Ithaki or Ithaka (; Greek: Ιθάκη, &quot;Ithaki&quot; ; Ancient Greek: Ἰθάκη, &quot;Ithákē&quot; ) is a Greek island located in the Ionian Sea, off the northeast coast of Kefalonia and to the west of continental Greece.

Ithaca&#x27;s main island has an area of and in 2021 had a population of 2,862. It is the second-smallest of the seven main Ionian Islands, after Paxi. Ithaca is a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands region, and the only municipality of the regional unit. The capital is Vathy (or Vathi).

Modern Ithaca is generally identified with Homer&#x27;s Ithaca, the home of Odysseus, whose delayed return to the island is the plot of the epic poem &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

==Alternative names==
Although the name Ithaca or Ithaka has remained unchanged since ancient times, written documents of different periods also refer to the island by other names, such as:

* Val di Compare (Valley of the Bestman), Piccola (Small) Cephallonia, Anticephallonia (Middle Ages until the beginning of the Venetian period)
* Ithaki nisos (Greek for island), Thrakoniso, Thakou, Thiakou (Byzantine period)
* Thiaki (Byzantine and before the Venetian period)
* Teaki (Venetian period)
* Fiaki (Ottoman period)

==History==
The island has been inhabited since the 4th millennium BC. It may have been the capital of Cephalonia during the Mycenaean period and the capital-state of the small kingdom ruled by Odysseus. The Romans occupied the island in the 2nd century BC, and later it became part of the Byzantine Empire. The Normans ruled Ithaca in the 13th century, and after a short Turkish rule it fell into Venetian hands (Ionian Islands under Venetian rule).

Ithaca was subsequently occupied by France under the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio. It was liberated by a joint Russo-Turkish force commanded by admirals Fyodor Ushakov and Kadir Bey in 1798 and subsequently became a part of the Septinsular Republic, which was originally established as a protectorate of the Russian Empire and Ottoman Empire. It became a French possession again in 1807, until it was taken over by the United Kingdom in 1809. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, Ithaca became a state of the United States of the Ionian Islands, a protectorate of the British Empire. In 1830, the local community requested to join with the rest of the newly restored nation-state of Greece. Under the 1864 Treaty of London, Ithaca, along with the remaining six Ionian islands, was ceded to Greece as a gesture of diplomatic friendship to Greece&#x27;s new Anglophile king, George I. The United Kingdom kept its privileged use of the harbour at Corfu.

===First settlers===
The origins of the first people to inhabit the island, which occurred during the last years of the Neolithic period (4000–3000 BC), are not clear. The traces of buildings, walls and a road from this time period prove that life existed and continued to do so during the Early Helladic era (3000–2000 BC). In the years (2000–1500 BC), some of the population migrated to part of the island. The buildings and walls that were excavated showed the lifestyle of this period had remained primitive.

===Mycenaean era===

During the Mycenaean period (1600–1100 BC), Ithaca rose to the highest level of its ancient history. Mostly based on the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and oral traditions, it is believed that the island became the capital of the Ionian Kingdom-State, which included the surrounding lands, and was referred to as one of the most powerful states of that time. The Ithacans were characterized as great navigators and explorers with daring expeditions reaching further than the Mediterranean Sea.

The epic poems of Homer, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, shed some light on Bronze-Age Ithaca. Those poems are generally thought to have been composed sometime in the 9th or 8th centuries BC, but may have made use of older mythological and poetic traditions; their depiction of the hero Odysseus and his rule over Ithaca and the surrounding islands and mainland preserves some memories of the political geography, customs, and society of the time.

After the end of the Mycenaean period Ithaca&#x27;s influence diminished, and it came under the jurisdiction of the nearest large island.

===Hellenistic era===
During the ancient Hellenic prime (800–180 BC), independent organized life continued in the northern and southern part of the island. In the southern part, in the area of Aetos, the town Alalcomenae was founded. From this period, many objects of important historical value have been found during excavations. Among these objects are coins imprinted with the name Ithaca and the image of Odysseus which suggest that the island was self-governed.

=== Middle Ages ===

Across time, the island fell to various conquerors and experienced changed circumstances, meaning the population of the island kept changing through history. Although there is no definite numerical information until the Venetian period, it is believed that from the Mycenaean to the Byzantine period, the number of inhabitants was several thousand, who lived mainly in the northern part of Ithaca. During the Middle Ages, the population decreased due to the continuous invasions of pirates, forcing the people to establish settlements and live in the mountains. 
The island, often referred to with the name &#x27;Val di Compare&#x27;, followed the fortunes of its bigger neighbor Cephalonia throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, when it formed part of the holdings of various Latin rulers. In 1185, when Cephalonia and Zakynthos were captured by Margaritone of Brindisi, it is most likely that Ithaca was among the territory he conquered. Later, Ithaca changed ownership together with Cephalonia, first to the Orsini family after Margaritone&#x27;s death, and then to John of Gravina, prince of Achaia, who conquered them from the Orsini in 1324. From 1333 until 1357 the islands were transferred to Robert of Taranto, who in 1357, bestowed them upon Leonardo Tocco, a Neapolitan courtier. While Ithaca had until now merely followed the fate of Cephalonia, it is under the Tocco that more specific mentions of Ithaca begin to appear in the record. In the 15th century, there was one family, the Galati, with noble privileges and land interests on the island given by the Tocco family.

===Ottoman and Venetian eras===
In 1479, Ottoman forces reached the islands and many of the people fled from the island out of fear of the new Turkish settlers. Those who remained hid in the mountains to avoid the pirates who controlled the channel between Cephalonia and Ithaca and the bays of the island. In the following five years, the Turks, Tocco and Venetians laid claim to the islands diplomatically. Possession of the islands was finally taken by the Ottoman Empire from 1484 to 1499. During this period, the Venetians had strengthened into a major power with an organized fleet. The Venetians pursued their interest in the Ionian Islands, and in 1499 a war between the Venetians and the Turks began. The allied fleets of the Venetians and the Spanish besieged Ithaca, and the other islands. The fleets prevailed, and from 1500 onwards the Venetians controlled the islands. According to a treaty of 1503, Ithaca, Cephalonia and Zakynthos would be ruled by the Venetians, and Lefkada by the Ottoman Empire. By then Ithaca was almost uninhabited, and the Venetians had to grant incentives to settlers from neighbouring islands and the mainland to repopulate it. 1504, the Venetians ordered official the repopulation of Ithaca with tax incentives to attract settlers from neighbouring islands. The Venetian authorities found the island was already being repopulated by members of the Galatis family, who laid claim to it as their property, having received rights over Ithaca under the Tocco regime. However, according to historians, the island received a great population revival in the period before and after the fall of Candia when numerous people from Crete arrived there as well as the noble Karavia family (Latin: Caravia), a branch of the ancient byzantine Kallergi family. This family and its followers inhabited settlements on the island, received fiefs from the Venetian Senate and indulged in a tremendously profitable maritime trade as well as piracy against the Ottomans. According to the French traveler Leake during the 18th century the families of Karavias, Petalas and the Dendrinos constituted the three main factions of the island, with the Karavias controlling its most productive part. During the next centuries the island remained under Venetian control. 

===French era===
A few years after the French Revolution, the Ionian area came under the rule of the First French Republic (1797–1798), and the island became the honorary capital of the French &quot;département&quot; of Ithaque, comprising Cephalonia, Lefkada, and part of the mainland (the prefecture was at Argostoli on Kefalonia).
The population welcomed the French, who took care in the control of the administrative and judicial systems, but later the heavy taxation they demanded caused a feeling of indignation among the people. During this short historical period, the new ideas of system and social structure greatly influenced the inhabitants of the island. At the end of 1798, the French were succeeded by Russia and Turkey (1798–1807), which were allies at that time. Corfu became the capital of the Septinsular Republic, and the form of government was democratic, with a fourteen-member senate in which Ithaca had one representative.

The Ithacan fleet flourished when it was allowed to carry cargo up to the ports of the Black Sea. In 1807, according to the Tilsit Treaty with Turkey, the Ionian Islands once again came under the French rule (1807–1809 AD). The French quickly began preparing to face the British fleet, which had become very powerful, by building a fort in Vathy.

===British and modern eras===
In 1809 Great Britain mounted a blockade on the Ionian Islands as part of the war against Napoleon, and in September of that year they hoisted the British flag above the castle of Zakynthos. Cephalonia and Ithaca soon surrendered, and the British installed provisional governments. The Treaty of Paris (1815) recognised the United States of the Ionian Islands and decreed that it become a British protectorate. Colonel Charles Philippe de Bosset became provisional governor between 1810 and 1814.

A few years later Greek nationalist groups started to form. Although their energy in the early years was directed to supporting their fellow Greek revolutionaries in the revolution against the Ottoman Empire, they switched their focus to &quot;enosis&quot; with Greece following their independence. The Party of Radicals (Greek: Κόμμα των Ριζοσπαστών) founded in 1848 as a pro-enosis political party. In September 1848, there were skirmishes with the British garrison in Argostoli and Lixouri on Kefalonia, which led to a certain level relaxation in the enforcement of the protectorates laws, and freedom of the press as well. The island&#x27;s populace did not hide their growing demands for enosis, and newspapers on the islands frequently published articles criticising British policies in the protectorate. On the 15th of August in 1849, another rebellion broke out, which was quashed by Henry George Ward, who proceeded to temporarily impose martial law.

During the British protectorate period prominent citizens of Ithaki participated in the secret &quot;Philiki Etairia&quot; which was instrumental in organizing the Greek Revolution of 1821 against Turkish rule, and Greek fighters found refuge there. In addition, the participation of Ithacans during the siege of Messolongi and the naval battles against Ottoman ships on the Black Sea and the Danube was significant.

Ithaca was annexed to the Greek Kingdom with the rest of the Ionian islands in 1864.

==Home of Odysseus==


Since antiquity, Ithaca has been identified as the home of the mythological hero Odysseus. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot; of Homer, Ithaca is described thus

...dwell in clear-seen Ithaca, wherein is a mountain, Neriton, covered with waving forests, conspicuous from afar; and round it lie many isles hard by one another, Dulichium, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus. Ithaca itself lies close in to the mainland the furthest toward the gloom, but the others lie apart toward the Dawn and the sun—a rugged isle, but a good nurse of young men

It has sometimes been argued that this description does not match the topography of modern Ithaca. Three features of the description have been seen as especially problematic. First, Ithaca is described as &quot;low-lying&quot; (), but Ithaca is mountainous. Second, the words &quot;farthest out to sea, towards the sunset&quot; () are usually interpreted to mean that Ithaca must be the island furthest to the west, but Kefalonia lies to the west of Ithaca. Lastly, it is unclear which modern islands correspond to Homer&#x27;s Doulichion and Same.

The Greek geographer Strabo, writing in the 1st century AD, identified Homer&#x27;s Ithaca with modern Ithaca. Following earlier commentators, he interpreted the word translated above as &quot;low-lying&quot; to mean &quot;close to the mainland&quot;, and the phrase translated as &quot;farthest out to sea, towards the sunset&quot; as meaning &quot;farthest of all towards the north.&quot; Strabo identified Same as modern Kefalonia, and believed that Homer&#x27;s Doulichion was one of the islands now known as the Echinades. Ithaca lies farther north than Kefalonia, Zacynthos, and the island that Strabo identified as Doulichion, consistent with the interpretation of Ithaca as being &quot;farthest of all towards the north.&quot;

Strabo&#x27;s explanation has not won universal acceptance. In the last few centuries, some scholars have argued that Homer&#x27;s Ithaca was not modern Ithaca, but a different island. Perhaps the best known proposal is that of Wilhelm Dörpfeld, who believed that the nearby island of Lefkada was Homer&#x27;s Ithaca, whereas Same was the present-day Ithaca.

It has also been suggested that Paliki, the western peninsula of Kefalonia, is Homer&#x27;s Ithaca. It has been argued that in Homeric times Paliki was separated from Kefalonia by a sea channel since closed up by earthquake-induced rockfalls. However, no scientific review publications are available in support of this theory. Indeed, scholars have found that &quot;all the geological and geomorphological evidence refutes this hypothesis&quot;.

Despite any difficulties with Homer&#x27;s description of the island, in classical and Roman times the island now called &quot;Ithaca&quot; was universally held to be the home of Odysseus; the Hellenistic identifications of Homeric sites, such as the identifications of Lipari as the island of Aeolus, are usually taken with a grain of salt, and attributed to the ancient tourist trade.
The island has been known as Ithaca from an early date, as coins and inscriptions show. Coins from Ithaca frequently portray Odysseus, and an inscription from the 3rd century BC refers to a local hero-shrine of Odysseus and games called the &quot;Odysseia&quot;. The Archaeological site of &quot;School of Homer&quot; on modern Ithaca is the only place in the Lefkas–Kefalonia–Ithaca Triangle where Linear B inscriptions may have been found, near royal remains. In 2010, Greek archaeologists discovered the remains of an 8th-century BC palace in the area of Agios Athanasios, leading to reports that this might have been the site of Odysseus&#x27;s palace.

Another archaeological feature on Ithaca is the so-called Polis Cave near Stavros in the north of the island. Heinrich Schliemann identified it as the cave that Odysseus visited on his return. Sylvia Benton, who carried out research in the cave in the 1930s, also interpreted her findings as an indication of a connection to Odysseus. However, as is now known, the site served as a place of worship for many centuries, from the beginning of the Bronze Age (Early Helladic) to the Roman period, without any clear connection to a possible life environment of Odysseus. Numerous votive offerings indicate that the nymphs in particular were the target of the ritual acts in the Polis cave.

Modern scholars generally accept the identification of modern Ithaca with Homeric Ithaca, and explain discrepancies between the &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s description and the actual topography as the product of lack of first-hand knowledge of the island, or as poetic licence.

==Geography==

Ithaca lies east of the northeast coast of Cephalonia, from which it is separated by the Strait of Ithaca. The regional unit covers an area of and has approximately of coastline. The main island stretches in the north-south direction, in length of and maximum width of . It consists of two parts, of about equal size, connected by the narrow isthmus of Aetos (Eagle), just wide. The two parts enclose the bay of Molos, whose southern branch is the harbor of Vathy, the capital and largest settlement of the island. The second largest village is Stavros in the northern part.

Lazaretto Islet (or &quot;Island of The Saviour&quot;) guards the harbor. The church of The Saviour and the remains of an old gaol are located on the islet.

The capes in the island include Exogi, the westernmost, Melissa to the north, Mavronos, Agios Ilias, Schinous, Sarakiniko and Agios Ioannis, to the east, and Agiou Andreou, to the south. Bays include Afales Bay to the northwest, Frikes and Kioni Bays to the northeast, Molos Gulf to the east, and Ormos Gulf and Sarakiniko Bay to the southeast. The tallest mountain is Nirito in the northern part (806 m), followed by Merovigli (669 m) in the south.

<text>Kent was a Swedish alternative rock band formed in Eskilstuna in 1990. With members Joakim Berg, Martin Sköld, Sami Sirviö and Markus Mustonen, the band had numerous radio hits throughout Sweden and Scandinavia and consecutive number-one studio albums on the Sweden top list (Sverigetopplistan) beginning with the release of &quot;Verkligen&quot; (1996) and led by the single &quot;Kräm (så nära får ingen gå)&quot;. With origins rooted in distorted rock, they found mainstream success through their alternative rock albums of the mid-1990s, 2000s and 2010s, the latter decades during which they adopted elements of synthpop. 

With eleven number-one albums, five number-one singles, 22 Swedish Grammy Awards, and over three million record sales, Kent is considered the most popular rock/pop group within Sweden and throughout Scandinavia. &quot;Vapen &amp; ammunition&quot; (2002) topped the Swedish charts for eight weeks. Kent is often compared to bands like U2 and Coldplay.

As Kent&#x27;s songs are primarily performed in Swedish, they are unfamiliar to most English-speaking audiences. Kent briefly attempted an international career with English versions of the albums &quot;Isola&quot; (1997) and &quot;Hagnesta Hill&quot; (1999) and an accompanying American tour for the former, but stopped after finding less success than they had in Scandinavia. Joakim Berg, the lead singer and lyricist, says &quot;there are two kinds of lyrics I write. One kind is based in places and the other is based in feelings. You move between those two whether you want to or not.&quot;

The band announced on 16 March 2016 that they would release their final album, titled &quot;Då som nu för alltid,&quot; after 26 years of performing. The album was released on 20 May 2016. The band&#x27;s announcement noted that the dissolution of the band is voluntary and is despite their continued success. In September, Kent began a months-long farewell tour that covered Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. The last concert was held at Tele2 Arena in Stockholm on 17 December 2016.

On 18 October 2024, Kent announced that they will play three concerts in Stockholm in March 2025. Due to the tickets quickly selling out, three additional concerts were announced.

==History==
===Formation and first years (1990–1994)===
The band &quot;Jones &amp; Giftet&quot; (Jones &amp; The Poison) was formed in 1990 with members Joakim &quot;Jocke&quot; Berg, Martin Sköld, Markus Mustonen, Sami Sirviö and Thomas Bergqvist (synthesizers). It all started with Berg going to London and buying two guitars, one for Sirviö and one for himself. At first it was Sami Sirviö and Joakim Berg who had the band together, later Sköld, Bergqvist and Mustonen joined. The first gig was played in Lindesberg in Västmanland, and the second at &quot;Knegoffs&quot; in Eskilstuna. In 1991, Jones &amp; Giftet won the contest &quot;Cult 91&quot; at the &quot;Skylight&quot; in Eskilstuna.

1992 is the year that Martin Roos plays with Jones &amp; Giftet for the first time at &quot;Cult 92&quot;. Soon thereafter Thomas Bergqvist was replaced by Martin Roos. On 30 September 1992 Jones &amp; Giftet changed their name to &quot;Havsänglar&quot; (Angelshark, lit. Sea angels). Gigs at the &quot;Spaghetti Companiet&quot;, Hannas Krog and the Pet Sounds Bar followed.

In 1993, Martin Roos moved up to Stockholm, and soon the rest followed. Jocke Berg&#x27;s brother Adam Berg, came up with the new name &quot;Kent&quot;. Kent played at Stockholm venues Tanto, Hyndans Hörna and Uppsala venue Kalmar Nation.

In March 1994 Kent recorded a 10-track demo under very simple conditions in an 8-track studio at Nytorpsskolan near Blåsut in Stockholm. The demo was given to Peter Ejheden at Pet Sounds who back then was working as a booker for a club (Pet Sounds Bar). In the same chain of events where he got the tape, Ejheden quit Pet Sounds and started working at BMG. In April Per Lindholm, A&amp;R at RCA/BMG heard Kent for the first time and was immediately interested. On 26 June Kent&#x27;s first record contract was signed. Kent went up to Silence Studios in Koppom, Värmland, to record the debut-album.

===&quot;Kent&quot; and &quot;Verkligen&quot; (1995–1996)===
In March 1995, Kent released their eponymous debut &quot;Kent&quot;. It was distorted and not much reminiscent of what Kent would release in later years. The first single from the debut album was &quot;När det blåser på månen&quot;.

Just one year later, in March 1996, Kent released &quot;Verkligen&quot; (Really). Guitarist Martin Roos had left the band for his career at Kent&#x27;s record company BMG. He would later become the band&#x27;s manager. The pre-release single &quot;Kräm (så nära får ingen gå)&quot; immediately became a radio hit and gained Kent some serious fame in Sweden. Two more singles were issued, &quot;Gravitation&quot; and &quot;Halka&quot;. Musically, the album was slower with less distortion and more emotion. After &quot;Verkligen&quot; was released, before the band went on a long tour that summer, Harri Mänty joined as a permanent band member.

===&quot;Isola&quot; (1997–1998)===

In November 1997, Kent released &quot;Isola&quot;. &quot;Verkligen&quot; had been heavily toured, gaining some reputation for Kent. The pre-release single, &quot;Om du var här&quot; (If You Were Here), became a radio hit. Musically the album changed a lot from &quot;Verkligen&quot;, going a lot in the direction of slower, more thoughtful songs with more emotion. The last song on the album, the 7 minute, 47 second-long &quot;747&quot;, with a characteristic keyboard riff and a long instrumental outro, became the band&#x27;s closer for every show for the next 8 years. It was also released as a single, cut down to four minutes and with an added short chorus.

In 1998, Kent released an English version of &quot;Isola&quot;, featuring an extra song only available on the English version, &quot;Velvet&quot;. Kent embarked on two accompanying US tours to promote the album. The first was in support of fellow Swedes, The Cardigans, and the second was a double-bill with American band, Papa Vegas. The band would close the shows for the second leg of the tour with what they described as their &quot;only cover song&quot;, a version of Depeche Mode&#x27;s classic single, &quot;Stripped&quot;. Singles were released in various territories for three of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;If You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Things She Said&quot; and &quot;747&quot;. The English version of &quot;Isola&quot; sold poorly.

===&quot;Hagnesta Hill&quot; and &quot;B-sidor 95-00&quot; (1999–2000)===

In December 1999, Kent released &quot;Hagnesta Hill&quot;, named after Hagnestahill, a part of Eskilstuna where the band had had their first studio. The first single from the album, &quot;Musik non stop&quot; (Music Non Stop), a disco-rock song, became a huge radio hit. The album was, for the most part, faster and less ballad-focused than Isola, and also mildly experimental with drum-machines and electronics. Two more singles were released, the industrial-esque &quot;En himmelsk drog&quot; (A Heavenly Drug) and the power-poppy &quot;Kevlarsjäl&quot; (Kevlar Soul).

In April 2000, an English version of &quot;Hagnesta Hill&quot; was released, featuring two songs from the Swedish version replaced with two new English tracks (&quot;Just Like Money&quot; and &quot;Quiet Heart&quot;). The album was also released in a limited digipack with one of the excluded songs, &quot;A Timekill to Die For&quot;, included as a hidden bonus track. The album was accompanied by the release of the single, &quot;Music Non Stop&quot;, featuring the other omitted song, &quot;Insects&quot;, as a b-side. A planned US release of the album was shelved, resulting in only &quot;cut-out&quot; promo copies floating around. Likewise, a US tour never materialized, as there was officially no album to promote. In connection with the release of the English version of &quot;Hagnesta Hill&quot;, Kent went on a European tour. They finished the tour at the Roskilde Festival.

Since their debut, Kent had recorded a large number of b-sides. Since most of these singles had long gone out of print, it was very hard to get these legally, so in 2000, Kent released the 2CD B-side collection &quot;B-sidor 95–00&quot; (B-Sides 95–00). It featured 21 b-sides and two totally new songs. A documentary was also shot the same year, &quot;Så nära får ingen gå – ett år med Kent&quot;. The documentary was produced by Per Sinding-Larsen and Mathias Engstrand.

===&quot;Vapen &amp; ammunition&quot; and the White Concert (2002–2003)===
After a seven-month timeout, Kent started to work on their next full-length album during the summer of 2001. Later that year they reported from the studio that they tried to make an album consisting of almost just singles. The first single &quot;Dom andra&quot; (The Others) released on 18 March 2002 became a huge hit on Swedish radio. When the album &quot;Vapen &amp; ammunition&quot; (&quot;Weapon(s) &amp; Ammunition&quot;) came out, the next two singles &quot;Kärleken väntar&quot; (Love Awaits) and &quot;FF&quot; (from the double A-side &quot;FF / VinterNoll2&quot;), plus the album track &quot;Pärlor&quot; (Pearls) became huge radio hits, resulting in album sales over 600,000, more than twice as many as any other Kent album to date. The definite proof of the album&#x27;s success was evident when the band received seven Swedish Grammy Awards in 2003.

Kent had not toured for several months when it was announced that they would only do one single performance in Sweden in 2003, on 6 June, the Swedish national day, in Stockholms Stadion which holds a crowd of 30,000. As the band told the crowd to come there dressed in white, it was nicknamed &quot;The White Concert&quot;. The band also played at the less known Parkfestivalen in Moss, Norway on 14 June 2003.

===&quot;Du &amp; jag döden&quot; and &quot;The hjärta &amp; smärta EP&quot; (2005–2006)===

After taking a one-year timeout, Kent returned to the studio to record their sixth album in 2004. Studio reports said it would be &quot;a very dark album&quot;. The first single released, &quot;Max 500&quot;, was well received by both fans and critics. When the album &quot;Du &amp; jag döden&quot; (You &amp; me death) was released, it was very well received and was considered by most fans to be one of their best albums. Two more singles were released, &quot;Palace &amp; Main&quot; and &quot;Den döda vinkeln&quot; (The Dead Angle) – the last one stirring up some controversy among Kent fans because Kent did not release any b-sides along with it (but still the single has a shorter version of the song). The last track on the album, &quot;Mannen i den vita hatten (16 år senare)&quot; (The Man in the White Hat (16 Years Later)) was very well received and is seen by many fans as Kent&#x27;s best effort. It also became the first song ever to replace &quot;747&quot; as the finale of a Kent concert.

During 2005 they embarked on &quot;Turné 19&quot; (Tour 19), doing 12 gigs in Sweden, one in Norway and one in Finland. The concerts took place in huge tents with a capacity of up to 18,000. This was the only tour that followed the release of &quot;Du &amp; jag döden&quot;. After &quot;Turné 19&quot;, Kent played once more at the Roskilde Festival.

There were rumours about Kent releasing an EP, as they had been spotted in studio and guitarist Sami had said, &quot;We might release an EP, but if we do it will only be digitally released.&quot; Just one month before the November 2005 release, &quot;The hjärta &amp; smärta EP&quot; (The Heart &amp; Pain EP) was confirmed, as a CD as well as a digital release. It was well received and contained five tracks, &quot;Dom som försvann&quot; (Those Who Disappeared) becoming the radio single and having a video recorded. The EP made No. 1 in Sweden and remained on the charts for 33 weeks.

During 2006, the band played only once in Sweden on the Hultsfred Festival and on two festivals in Norway, Rockfest Haugesund and Norwegian Wood Festival. They&#x27;ve also released the single &quot;Nålens öga&quot; for Swedish Save the children.

===&quot;Tillbaka till samtiden&quot; and &quot;Box 1991–2008&quot; (2007–2008)===
During December 2006 – 2007 the band announced—on two different occasions—that they had started recording their seventh Swedish studio album, and that guitarist Harri Mänty had decided to leave the band.

On 18 July 2007, the band announced the title and release date of their new album, &quot;Tillbaka till samtiden&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Back to the Present&quot;). Its official release was on 17 October 2007 but many stores began selling it five days in advance due to an internet leak of the album. The first single of the album was released on 17 September 2007 with the title &quot;Ingenting&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Nothing&quot;). The band played four songs at a private gig in Denmark where their new album premiered. The sound of the album has been described as more electro based rock. Due to the speed in which the tour&#x27;s concerts were sold out, the band added seven extra concerts to their Scandinavian tour. As well, lead singer Joakim Berg has remarked that &quot;Tillbaka till samtiden&quot; contains some of his favourite material he has recorded. They were also presented with &quot;Album of the Year&quot; and &quot;Group of the Year&quot; at the 2008 Swedish Grammy Awards. They went on to win a Rockbjörnen (Swedish for &quot;The rock bear&quot;) award for &quot;Swedish Album of the Year&quot; and a P3 Guld award for &quot;Swedish Group of the Year&quot;. Kent released the compilation &quot;Box 1991–2008&quot;, featuring all their previous studio albums and previously unreleased material, in all Nordic countries on 29 October 2008.

In October 2008, their 2002 song &quot;VinterNoll2&quot; was included in &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;, becoming the first and to date only Swedish-language song to be included in a &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; game.

On 23 December 2008, Kent released a new song, &quot;På drift?&quot;. &quot;Kent wishes you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year by offering a brand new song for free,&quot; the band writes on their website (kent.nu).

===&quot;Röd&quot; and &quot;En plats i solen&quot; (2009–2010)===
On 4 October 2009, Kent announced their eighth studio album &quot;Röd&quot; and the first single &quot;Töntarna&quot; was released on 5 October as digital download. &quot;Röd&quot; was released on 5 November 2009 and has an even greater touch of synthesizers than previous albums. On the release day of &quot;Röd&quot;, Kent played in front of a hundred specially invited guests (mostly journalists) at The Bowery Hotel in New York. The setlist consisted of 6 tracks from the new album, and the whole thing was shown live on Aftonbladet&#x27;s website.

On 2 November 2009, Kent auctioned off 100 limited physical copies of the song &quot;2000&quot; for charity. The song was also released as digital download. &quot;2000&quot; was used as the theme song for the Swedish TV-series &quot;Hemlösa&quot;, covering the homeless problem in Stockholm.

Kent&#x27;s Röd tour started in Stockholm on 25 February 2010, with four shows in Globe Arena Annexet during that week. They did 18 shows in total around the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) for this tour. In May 2010, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, in collaboration with Sony Music Sweden AB, released &quot;SingStar Kent&quot; on both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 games consoles, as part of the SingStar music video games.
On 14 June 2010, Kent announced their ninth studio album, &quot;En plats i solen&quot; (Swedish for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;) due for release on 30 June, only seven months after the release of their previous studio album, &quot;Röd&quot;. Berg has said about the recording of &quot;En plats i solen&quot;: &quot;We had a kind of idea that we were going to record an album very quickly this time, we had already some demos ready. We wanted to go into the studio, record and mix the album and then distribute it directly.&quot; Unlike the two previous albums, which were produced with Danish producer Joshua, &quot;En plats i solen&quot; is produced with Swedish producer Stefan Boman who worked with the band on &quot;Du &amp; jag döden&quot; (2005). The band also released the first single from the forthcoming album, featuring the two A-sides &quot;Gamla Ullevi&quot; and &quot;Skisser för sommaren&quot;.

Kent embarked on a summer tour in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, starting at the Peace &amp; Love Festival in Sweden and finishing on 8 August at the Skanderborg Festival in Denmark.

===&quot;Jag är inte rädd för mörkret&quot; and &quot;Tigerdrottningen&quot; (2012–2015)===
On 22 June 2011, Kent signed a recording contract with Universal Music in Sweden, after sixteen years with BMG and later Sony Music. The band&#x27;s manager, Martin Roos, said in a press release: &quot;After sixteen years with BMG/Sony Music it feels great with a new beginning, and Universal Music gave us the best offer.&quot; In April 2012, Kent released their tenth studio album, &quot;Jag är inte rädd för mörkret&quot; (Swedish for &quot;I Am Not Afraid of the Dark&quot;). It was recorded in France. The album included the songs &quot;999&quot; and &quot;Jag ser dig&quot; which was well received by both fans and critics. &quot;Jag är inte rädd för mörkret&quot; is piano-based.

During the summer, Kent toured Scandinavia, first with a short spring tour at the end of May (24 May–2 June) and then at festivals and own concerts in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark during June, July and August. During this summer tour they started their concerts with an old unreleased song named &quot;Ögon&quot; from the early 1990s, with a new version of the song. The song was included in the 2008 compilation &quot;Box 1991–2008&quot;, but only as a demo from the early 1990s.

In December 2012, Kent announced on their Twitter account that they were to release a track on New Year&#x27;s Day called &quot;Ingen kunde röra oss&quot;.

On 29 November 2013, Kent went to Los Angeles and recorded their eleventh studio album, Berg said in an interview: &quot;We wanted to do this kind of Fleetwood Mac thing and go to LA and dream under the sun. Now the dollar is so low, in addition – all the big studios are empty, no one uses them anymore.&quot; The first single &quot;La Belle Epoque&quot; was released on 12 March 2014 and the album &quot;Tigerdrottningen&quot; was released on 30 April. The album features a lot of female backing vocals and duets. During the month of May Kent went on a small club tour in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In the summer of 2014 Kent held their own festival called Kentfest in Gothenburg and Stockholm. They also played at festivals in Denmark and Norway.

In 2015, Kent played at three festivals in Scandinavia, Joakim Berg announced at the Bråvalla festival that they were going to record a new album that fall. That year, Kent celebrated the 20th anniversary of their debut album, &quot;Kent&quot;, by releasing the band&#x27;s first 10 albums on vinyl.

===&quot;Då som nu för alltid&quot; and the final tour (2016)===
In February 2016, Kent was elected to Swedish Music Hall of Fame. In March the band announced that &quot;Då som nu för alltid&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Then as Now Forever&quot;) would be their last album, and that they would make a final tour in the Nordic countries, with the last concert in Stockholm in December 2016. &quot;Egoist&quot; was announced as the album&#x27;s first single, and it was released on 14 March. However, on 17 April 2016 Kent announced the track listing which omitted &quot;Egoist&quot;. Instead, &quot;Vi är inte längre där&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single on 3 May. The album &quot;Då som nu för alltid&quot; was released on 20 May 2016. On 24 August, it was announced the compilation album &quot;Best of&quot; would be released on 16 September 2016, containing 20 previously released tracks and four new studio recordings. For &quot;Då som nu för alltid&quot; the band won two Swedish Grammy Awards, &quot;Album of the Year&quot; and &quot;Rock of the Year&quot;.

From the spring of 2015 until the band&#x27;s very last concert, Per Sinding-Larsen followed Kent&#x27;s last time together to record a documentary called &quot;Vi är inte längre där (Sista åren med Kent)&quot;, which was shown on SVT in two parts on the 26 and 27 December 2016. The documentary revealed, among other things, that Harri Mänty was fired from the band due to excessive partying and not that he left off his own accord as has been previously stated.

===Post-Kent activities (2017–present)===
After 2016, Joakim Berg has written and produced songs with a number of different artists, such as Veronica Maggio, Ghost, Smith &amp; Thell and Lars Winnerbäck. In May 2022, Berg released a solo album, &quot;Jag fortsätter glömma&quot;. He has also worked with his former bandmate Martin Sköld after the dissolution of the band.

In April 2024, Berg was a guest on the podcast, &quot;Back to the music with Ingrid&quot;. Among other things, he was asked if Kent will ever release a new album or play live again and he replied: &quot;It would have been great fun to do that but... No, we haven&#x27;t talked about that. Or, we&#x27;ve talked about it. But it would be more of a live thing maybe.&quot; On 18 October 2024, Kent announced that they will play three concerts in Stockholm in March 2025. On 15 March 2025, it will be the 30th anniversary of their eponymous debut album &quot;Kent&quot; and the 20th anniversary of their album &quot;Du &amp; jag döden&quot;.

==Musical style==
Kent have been grouped with various genres, including alternative rock, indie rock, pop rock, synth-pop, pop, and arena rock.

Kent has been referred to as Sweden&#x27;s biggest rock band, but has always put pop melodies in focus. Kent&#x27;s biggest change in musical style came with the band&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Tillbaka till samtiden&quot;, which marked a clear shift from alternative rock to synthpop/rock.

<text>Forensic palynology is a subdiscipline of palynology (the study of pollen grains, spores, and other palynomorphs), that aims to prove or disprove a relationship among objects, people, and places that may pertain to both criminal and civil cases. Pollen can reveal where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, countries, and even different parts of a single garden will have a distinctive pollen assemblage. Pollen evidence can also reveal the season in which a particular object picked up the pollen. Recent research into forensic palynology has seen advancements in DNA barcoding from pollen, to the level of singular pollen molecules, allowing DNA profiles to be created from singular palynomorphs, streamlining the efficiency and accuracy of taxonomic identification.

Palynology is the study of [[palynomorphs]] – microscopic structures of both animal and plant origin that are resistant to decay. This includes spermatophyte pollen, as well as spores (fungi, bryophytes, and ferns), dinoflagellates, and various other organic microorganisms – both living and fossilized. There are a variety of ways in which the study of these microscopic, walled particles can be applied to criminal forensics.

In areas such as New Zealand, where the demand for this field is high, forensic palynology has been used as evidence in many different case types that range anywhere from non-violent to extremely violent crimes. Pollen has been used to trace activity at mass graves in Bosnia, pinpoint the scene of a crime, and catch a burglar who brushed against a &quot;Hypericum&quot; bush during a crime. Because pollen has distinct morphology and is relatively indestructible, it is likely to adhere to a variety of surfaces often without notice and has even become a part of ongoing research into forensic bullet coatings.

== Present status ==
Forensic palynology is an evolving forensic science application. And is mostly utilized in countries such as New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom. It is relatively &quot;small, disparate, and fragmented&quot; compared to the other approaches, thus, there is no thorough guide to achieve the best practice in forensic palynology. Moreover, there is a limit in forensic palynologists as most skilled palynologists do not enter the forensic palynology field. As becoming a Forensic Palynologist requires rigorous training and education, one must attain a PhD with sufficient background in studies such as forensic science, botany, ecology, geography, and climatology. Most importantly they must receive training in the field of quaternary science. Recently however, there has been expansive research into areas that have yet to well documented, such as the study that did research on the effects that an arid climate had on pollen analytics that took place in southeast Spain. This study not only expanded the use of forensic palynology into new parts of the world that have not yet been introduced to this science, but also collected results that outline a proper method for pollen spectra collecting that is effective in arid conditions. Another recent study did research in Bolivia to study the pollen assemblage in high altitude soils, this study also created a forensic database for uses in non-seasonal soil. This database creation is allowing forensic palynology to be used in a more broad area now, as data for both high altitude pollen assemblage and non-seasonal soil data has been collected. Another recent advancement in forensic palynology is the massive expansion of the largest pollen database on the internet, PalDat. The University of Vienna and AGES worked to integrate over 2000 datasets consisting of detailed methods for pollen analysis including the use of high resolution light microscopy micrographs of hydrated pollen, and polarity ratios to determine the shape and aperture position of a pollen grain.

== Duties ==
In terms of criminal investigation, forensic palynologist services are requested from cases such as forgery, rape, homicide, genocide, terrorism, drug dealing, assault, and robbery. It usually consist of a single individual who works with the polynomial case. Of course, the palynologist could still consult other professionals. Furthermore, the palynologist should be given significant information as there is only one person handling the analysis of the samples. Important duties to note is that they ensure that all paperwork is dated, signed, filed and archived in order to maintain good records. Forensic Palynologists usually visit the crime scene to survey the vegetation. For example, identify plants and their characteristics and qualities ( size, vigor...) and obtain plant samples to allow for analysis like ground sampling. Geography analysis including a survey of the topography, altitude, climate, and geology of the area is also required, as all of these factors influence the assemblage and composition of palynomorphs. Scrubbing, scraping, washing is essential for retrieval of palynomorphs from various materials. And utilize other methods like police photographers, cartographers, and botanists. It is vital for the Forensic Palynologist to visit the crime scene before the Crime Science Investigators (CSI) or Scenes of crime Officers (SOCOs) to avoid disturbance of environmental evidence and contamination.

== Advantages ==
Pollen and similar spores are generally less than 50 microns across, resulting in their easy and unnoticeable transportation.

Pollen grains have a variety of shapes, sizes, colors, structures, and numbers identification keys exist as a reference. Large-scale collections of pollen specimens that reside in museums and university herbaria also serve as a resource for forensic palynologists to identify and classify the samples they collect. There are also many online databases that consist of thousands of records and identification methods for palynomorphs that are accessible worldwide.

A sample of pollen from a crime scene can help to identify a specific plant species that may have had contact with a victim, or point to evidence that does not ecologically belong in the area. A pollen assemblage is a sample of pollen with a variety of plant species represented. Identifying those species and their relative frequency can point to a specific area or time of year. This could aid in the determination of whether the scene where the pollen was found was the primary scene or secondary scene. Pollen is made in great numbers, by a large variety of plants, and it is designed to be dispersed (either via wind, insect, or another method) throughout the immediate environment. Pollen can also be found in soil, clothing, hair, drugs, stomach contents, ropes, and rock which are places where it would be difficult for the suspect to remove because of pollen&#x27;s adhesion properties. In some cases, where the pollen of a plant is absent, fungi and fungal spores may be able to detect a plant&#x27;s presence at the site. There have been cases where the presence of rarely reported fungi and fungal spores have helped identify information in forensic cases. Pollen has been found inside counterfeit pharmaceuticals that have been transported across the world, the presence of the pollen can be used to trace these illegal drugs back to their manufacturing region and even factory.

== Disadvantages ==
One of the main disadvantages in this field is the lack of trained specialists. As of 2008, there are no academic centers or training facilities for the use of pollen in forensics in the U.S. This is crucial because of the expertise required to identify palynomorphs and to apply the data to geolocation information. Many things could go wrong and invalidate any samples collected, especially if the personnel handling them is not experienced. On the subject of experience, contamination is another major problem that can invalidate the use of a sample as evidence; therefore, it is important that samples are collected early on with collection sites identified depending on the case.

Limited access to international databases can also prove to be an issue when it comes time for the analyst to identify pollen evidence to a specific family or genus of plants. Currently, a database from Austria called PalDat exists but there are no known databases to exist in North America. However, PalDat is internationally accessible and data from around the world has been published.

Another disadvantage is in the form of the lack of history and therefore acceptance in the forensic setting and the court of law. Forensic palynology is not used in many countries and the application and methodologies have not been reviewed extensively in the court as this methodology has only been around for 50 years and only in some countries. This means that forensic palynology evidence is rarely submitted due to lack of history in the courts, and lack of application in most countries.

== Methods ==

=== Sample collection ===
Because pollen can be easily picked up by anyone, it is important that pollen samples are collected as soon as possible to prevent contamination from outside sources. Samples then need to be prepared and placed on slides in order to fully be safe from contamination. The process of preparing the samples and identifying them is time-consuming. When collecting a sample, it should be paired with site surveys and photos of the scene to provide context for later uses. For example, if the pollen evidence is used in court, then the additional context would be useful.

Sample collection methods will vary depending on the case investigation and on the collector. Due to the lack of palynologists in the forensic field, other forensic scientists that are present may have to collect the samples. This raises issues in terms of the quality of the sample, since collection sites for the sample should be determined depending on the case. Discussion with the investigation team is necessary in order to establish the best sampling method.

When collection sites have been determined, samples can be retrieved with clean instruments and placed into tightly sealed, sterile containers. Examples are &quot;sterile zip-lock plastic bags, or screw-top plastic (in preference to glass) containers.&quot; After each sample, instruments should be thoroughly cleaned or replaced to prevent contamination. In cases, where collection is by hand, gloves should be used and replaced after each sample. Samples should be labeled and sample history documentation should be maintained to keep track of the people who have had access to the sample.

=== Analysis ===
Analyzing the samples, once the palynomorphs have been extracted, will allow for identification, which can then be used in a forensic case to relate a person or object to a crime scene, or even to determine whether the scene at which the pollen was found was the primary or the secondary scene.

Samples are chemically processed with a mix of acids, sodium hydroxide, acetic anhydride with water washes in between. They are then neutralized, and the extracts are stained and mounted onto slides for microscopic examination. This helps in identification with the help of available reference collections to make comparisons on the pollen&#x27;s characteristics. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been used traditionally since the 1970s for primary identification of palynomorphs, but is very time-consuming, tedious, and not ideal for routine analysis.

Compared to the SEM, semi-automated pollen grain imaging techniques such as Transmitted Light Microscopy (TLM), Widefield fluorescent method, and Structured illumination (Apotome) were found to have a higher speed and accuracy when it came to the identification of pollen spores.

DNA Barcoding is another method used to differentiate between pollen grains by comparing their DNA sequences. A pollen grain of 10 micrometers in length is required. Once the sample is collected and prepared, genetic markers are placed, then the DNA is isolated, and finally the DNA is sequenced, usually through high throughout sequencing (HTS). HTS is faster and less expensive than traditional methods for DNA barcoding.

== Case examples ==

=== Austria, 1959 ===
One of the earliest document cases in which pollen plays a key role took place in Austria. A man went missing, and was presumed murdered, but no body was found. The authorities had arrested a suspect, who had motive for the murder, but did not have a body or confession, and the case stalled. A search of the suspect&#x27;s belongings yielded a pair of muddy boots. The mud was sampled and given to Wilhelm Klaus, at the University of Vienna&#x27;s Paleobotany Department, for analysis. Dr. Klaus found modern pollen from a variety of species, including spruce, willow, and alder. He also found fossilized hickory pollen grains, from a species long extinct. There was only one area of the Danube River Valley that hosted those living plants, and had Miocene-aged rock deposits that would contain the fossilized species. When the suspect was presented with this information, he willingly confessed and lead authorities to the sites of both the murder and the body, both of which were inside the region indicated by Dr. Klaus.

=== United States, 1970 ===
The first cases that involved forensic palynology in the United States was in 1970, where Honeybee pollination studies were issued. During this time honey pollen analysis began growing as the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), insured beekeepers a higher world market price for their honey. Under the premisses that the honey was produced on USA grounds. Thus, honey samples were sent for pollen analysis, where confirmation that the honey was produced in the USA was concluded or not. Generally, most of the cases during this time involved lawsuits concerning beekeepers. For example, a Michigan beekeeper arose suspect of importing beehives from the southeastern USA that weren&#x27;t inspected for mites. This led to the USDA inspecting honey samples where it was concluded that they were imported from the Southeastern region of USA. Due to that the honey contained floral types common to the Southeastern region and not found in Michigan.

=== United Kingdom, 1993 ===
An example concerning Forensic Palynology in the United Kingdom, took place during 1993 handled by Patricia Wiltshire. Where it involved a murder case in which the body was laid on soil that preserved pollen. Wiltshire then found traces of walnut pollen in the soil and suspect&#x27;s shoes, however, the walnut pollen found was unusual as there was no walnut site nearby. However, It was later discovered that a walnut tree was cut down thirty years before and the walnut pollen remained. the pollen was then analyzed and linked to the suspect in the crime scene. Thus, the walnut pollen provided a significant role solving the case.

=== New Zealand, 2005 ===
After a home invasion, two burglars brushed past a &quot;Hypericum&quot; bush outside of the house. One of the burglars was brought in as a suspect, but all evidence was circumstantial, and the man did not confess. Analysis of his clothes revealed the &quot;Hypericum&quot; pollen. The presence of pollen is ubiquitous, but in this case, the pollen was clumped onto the clothing (rather than dusted) and did not seem to be simply the result of air dispersal. It was ultimately concluded that &quot;the clothes had so much &quot;Hypericum&quot; pollen on them that they had to have been in direct and intimate contact with a flowering bush.&quot;

=== United States, 2015 ===
A modern application of forensic palynology occurred in 2015, in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. A body of a young female child was discovered by law enforcement in the Boston Harbour, but no identifying features remained as the body was in the late stages of decomposition. Investigators submitted samples taken from the clothes of the victim, a blanket found with the body, as well as a small amount of recovered hair to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection directorate laboratory in Houston, Texas, for pollen analysis. The report from the submitted samples provided investigators with information they could use to identify the unknown victim.

The pollen assemblage created from the submitted samples indicated the victim was in the north-eastern United States before her death. The individual taxa of plant species observed in the assemblage also indicated that the victim lived in, or spent much of her time in, a developed, urban environment. The assemblage also captured pollen of the Lebanese cedar tree (Cedrus libani), native to the Eastern Mediterranean region of Europe. The species of cedar observed in the assemblage was thought by investigators to most likely be from an ornamental piece in a park or other conservation area. This is when the investigators discovered individuals of the Lebanese cedar tree in the Arnold Arboretum, a public park that is a part of Harvard University.

Investigators then asked around the neighborhoods surrounding the arboretum, and a tip led them to a resident who, after questioning, admitted that her boyfriend at the time had abused the child, which resulted in the child&#x27;s death. The man who murdered the child was sentenced to serve a minimum of 20 years for second degree murder. The mother&#x27;s involvement in the crime is not reported, though she served 2 years probation for accessory after a plea deal for providing information about her then boyfriend who had committed the act.

=== Argentina, 2023 ===
A man was reported missing to the local police in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The family reported a possible suspect due to the fact the missing person and the suspect had intense arguments not long before his disappearance. The police searched the suspects house and found bloodstains on clothing items under the bed. They then took clothing items of the suspect for evidence analysis and soil samples from the garden of the suspects house. 25 days later, the police found the missing persons body was found 1000 meters off a coastline. Forensic mycology and palynology was then applied to analyse the palynomorphs and fungal species, as soil samples from the location of the corpse were analyzed. Samples were first acquired by scarping the surface area and then filtration and acetolysis was conducted to isolate the pollen samples. The analysis of the suspects clothing was then compared to the analysis of the corpse and the surrounding area. Results indicated that the corpse had a palynomorph composition of marine species, the quantity and exact species were all documented. The soil from the suspects house had a continental palynomorph composition that was also fully documented and recorded. The suspects bloodstained clothing had the same marine palynomorph composition as the body and the surrounding area. Soil samples in the suspects car and under the soles of the suspects shoes also contained the same palynomorph composition as the coastline area where the body was found. Along with other forensic evidence, the suspect was found guilty and the use of forensic palynology was used to help close this case.

<text>A mosaic is a pattern or image made of small regular or irregular pieces of colored stone, glass or ceramic, held in place by plaster/mortar, and covering a surface. Mosaics are often used as floor and wall decoration, and were particularly popular in the Ancient Roman world.

Mosaic today includes not just murals and pavements, but also artwork, hobby crafts, and industrial and construction forms.

Mosaics have a long history, starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman Kingdom of Sicily in the 12th century, by the eastern-influenced Republic of Venice, and among the Rus. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practice the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jewish artists to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics.

Figurative mosaic, but mostly without human figures, was widely used on religious buildings and palaces in early Islamic art, including Islam&#x27;s first great religious building, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, and the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Such mosaics went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century, except for geometrical patterns in techniques such as zellij, which remain popular in many areas.

Modern mosaics are made by artists and craftspeople around the world. Many materials other than traditional stone, ceramic tesserae, enameled and stained glass may be employed, including shells, beads, charms, chains, gears, coins, and pieces of costume jewelry.
== Mosaic materials ==

Traditional mosaics are made of small cubes of roughly square pieces of stone or hand made glass enamel of different colours, known as tesserae. Some of the earliest mosaics were made of natural pebbles, originally used to reinforce floors.

Mosaic skinning (covering objects with mosaic glass) is done with thin enameled glass and opaque stained glass. Modern mosaic art is made from any material in any size ranging from carved stone, bottle caps, and found objects.
== History ==

The earliest known examples of mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Abra, Mesopotamia, and are dated to the second half of 3rd millennium BC. They consist of pieces of colored stones, shells and ivory. Excavations at Susa and Chogha Zanbil show evidence of the first glazed tiles, dating from around 1500 BC. However, mosaic patterns were not used until the times of Sassanid Empire and Roman influence.

===Greek and Roman===
Bronze Age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae, and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës, Albania in 1916, is an early figural example; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC. Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders.
Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name, describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl.
Both of these themes were widely copied.

Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings, a far more prestigious artform, and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos.

Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek, suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves. Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across North Africa, in places such as Carthage, and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia.

There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic: &quot;opus vermiculatum&quot; used tiny &quot;tesserae&quot;, typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. The tiny &quot;tesserae&quot; allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting. Often small panels called &quot;emblemata&quot; were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work. The normal technique was &quot;opus tessellatum&quot;, using larger tesserae, which was laid on site. There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.

In Rome, Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the &quot;Domus Aurea&quot;, built 64 AD, and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites. However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression. The Roman church of Santa Costanza, which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family, has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault, which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration.

The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics &quot;in situ&quot; in the world, and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The large &quot;villa rustica&quot;, which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian, was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century. The most important pieces are the &quot;Circus Scene&quot;, the 64m long &quot;Great Hunting Scene&quot;, the &quot;Little Hunt&quot;, the &quot;Labours of Hercules&quot; and the famous &quot;Bikini Girls&quot;, showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis. The peristyle, the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics. Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted are an Orpheus mosaic, &quot;Alexander the Great&#x27;s Hunt&quot; and the &quot;Four Seasons&quot;.

In 1913 the Zliten mosaic, a Roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests, hunting and everyday life, was discovered in the Libyan town of Zliten. In 2000 archaeologists working in Leptis Magna, Libya, uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD. The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue, staring at his slain opponent. The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen – a &quot;masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii.&quot;

A specific genre of Roman mosaic was called &quot;asaroton&quot; (Greek for &quot;unswept floor&quot;). It depicted in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; style the feast leftovers on the floors of wealthy houses.

===Christian mosaics===

====Early Christian art====
With the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century, wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses. The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana, both from the 4th century, still exist. The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus, which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum, the original function of this building. In another great Constantinian basilica, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The so-called Tomb of the Julii, near the crypt beneath St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations. The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki, converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century, was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics. Only fragments survive of the original decoration, especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.

In the following century Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire, became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d&#x27;oro, now a chapel of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background. The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists.

Albingaunum was the main Roman port of Liguria. The octagonal baptistery of the town was decorated in the 5th century with high quality blue and white mosaics representing the Apostles. The surviving remains are somewhat fragmented. Massilia remained a thriving port and a Christian spiritual center in Southern Gaul where favourable societal and economic conditions ensured the survival of mosaic art in the 5th and 6th centuries. The large baptistery, once the grandest building of its kind in Western Europe, had a geometric floor mosaic which is only known from 19th century descriptions. Other parts of the episcopal complex were also decorated with mosaics as new finds, that were unearthed in the 2000s, attest. The funerary basilica of Saint Victor, built in a quarry outside the walls, was decorated with mosaics but only a small fragment with blue and green scrolls survived on the intrados of an arch (the basilica was later buried under a medieval abbey).

A mosaic pavement depicting humans, animals and plants from the original 4th-century cathedral of Aquileia has survived in the later medieval church. This mosaic adopts pagan motifs such as the Nilotic scene, but behind the traditional naturalistic content is Christian symbolism such as the ichthys. The 6th-century early Christian basilicas of Sant&#x27; Eufemia :it:Basilica di Sant&#x27;Eufemia (Grado) and Santa Maria delle Grazie in Grado also have mosaic floors.

====Ravenna====
In the 5th-century Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire, became the center of late Roman mosaic art. The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430. The vaults of the small, cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background. The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky. Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista. She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna. The mosaics depicted the storm, portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna, Peter Chrysologus. They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747.

Ostrogoths kept alive the tradition in the 6th century, as the mosaics of the Arian Baptistry, Baptistry of Neon, Archbishop&#x27;s Chapel, and the earlier phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo testify.

After 539, Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and became the seat of the Exarchate of Ravenna. The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century. Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo. The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint Justinian I and Empress Theodora in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest. The mosaics of the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare in Classe were made around 549. The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of San Michele in Affricisco, executed in 545–547 (largely destroyed; the remains in Berlin).

The last example of Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna was commissioned by bishop Reparatus between 673 and 679 in the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare in Classe. The mosaic panel in the apse showing the bishop with Emperor Constantine IV is obviously an imitation of the Justinian panel in San Vitale.

====Butrint====
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of Butrint, Albania appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation, dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century. The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures, birds, terrestrial beasts, fruits, flowers, trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God&#x27;s creation. Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets, tabulae ansatae, carrying inscriptions. A variety of fish, a crab, a lobster, shrimps, mushrooms, flowers, a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions, which reads: In fulfilment of the vow (prayer) of those whose names God knows. This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors&#x27; humility and an acknowledgement of God&#x27;s omniscience.

The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God&#x27;s creation; some elements also have specific connotations. The kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist, the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation. Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life. Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ: &quot;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.&quot; Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened.

====Late Antique and Early Medieval Rome====

Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome, gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages. 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period. Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings. In the apse mosaic of Sant&#x27;Agata dei Goti (462–472, destroyed in 1589) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him, six on either side. At Sant&#x27;Andrea in Catabarbara (468–483, destroyed in 1686) Christ appeared in the center, flanked on either side by three Apostles. Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ. The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559. The composition probably remained unchanged: Christ flanked by male and female saints, seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet. All three mosaics had a similar iconography.

6th-century pieces are rare in Rome but the mosaics inside the triumphal arch of the basilica of San Lorenzo fuori le mura belong to this era. The &quot;Chapel of Ss. Primo e Feliciano&quot; in Santo Stefano Rotondo has very interesting and rare mosaics from the 7th century. This chapel was built by Pope Theodore I as a family burial place.

In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art, noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede, Santa Maria in Domnica, Sant&#x27;Agnese fuori le Mura, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano. The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics. They were all destroyed later except for one example, the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century. Another great work of Pope Leo, the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna, depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side, and SS. Susanna and Felicity on the other. It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585. Pope Paschal I (817–824) embellished the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church (destroyed in 1607).

The fragment of an 8th-century mosaic, the Epiphany is one of the very rare remaining pieces of the medieval decoration of Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, demolished in the late 16th century. The precious fragment is kept in the sacristy of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. It proves the high artistic quality of the destroyed St. Peter&#x27;s mosaics.

====Byzantine mosaics====


Mosaics were more central to Byzantine culture than to that of Western Europe. Byzantine church interiors were generally covered with golden mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries. The majority of Byzantine mosaics were destroyed without trace during wars and conquests, but the surviving remains still form a fine collection.

The great buildings of Emperor Justinian like the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Nea Church in Jerusalem and the rebuilt Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem were certainly embellished with mosaics but none of these survived.
Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian&#x27;s reign. The figures, animals, plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background. The portrait of a moustached man, probably a Gothic chieftain, is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age. The so-called &quot;small sekreton&quot; of the palace was built during Justin II&#x27;s reign around 565–577. Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room. The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition. There are remains of floral decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki (5th–6th centuries).
In the 6th century, Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, became the center of mosaic making. Istria also boasts some important examples from this era. The Euphrasian Basilica in Parentium was built in the middle of the 6th century and decorated with mosaics depicting the Theotokos flanked by angels and saints.

Fragments remain from the mosaics of the Church of Santa Maria Formosa in Pola. These pieces were made during the 6th century by artists from Constantinople. Their pure Byzantine style is different from the contemporary Ravennate mosaics.

Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the Iconoclastic destruction of the 8th century. Among the rare examples are the 6th-century &quot;Christ in majesty&quot; (or &quot;Ezekiel&#x27;s Vision&quot;) mosaic in the apse of the Church of Hosios David in Thessaloniki that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times. Nine mosaic panels in the Hagios Demetrios Church, which were made between 634 and 730, also escaped destruction. Unusually almost all represent Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki, often with suppliants before him. This iconoclasm was almost certainly because of nearby Muslims&#x27; beliefs.
In the Iconoclastic era, figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry. The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople (after 740). There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea. The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules (787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively, the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922).

A similar Theotokos image flanked by two archangels were made for the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople in 867. The dedication inscription says: &quot;The images which the impostors had cast down here pious emperors have again set up.&quot; In the 870s the so-called &quot;large sekreton&quot; of the Great Palace of Constantinople was decorated with the images of the four great iconodule patriarchs.

The post-Iconoclastic era was the heyday of Byzantine art with the most beautiful mosaics executed. The mosaics of the Macedonian Renaissance (867–1056) carefully mingled traditionalism with innovation. Constantinopolitan mosaics of this age followed the decoration scheme first used in Emperor Basil I&#x27;s Nea Ekklesia. Not only this prototype was later totally destroyed but each surviving composition is battered so it is necessary to move from church to church to reconstruct the system.

An interesting set of Macedonian-era mosaics make up the decoration of the Hosios Loukas Monastery. In the narthex there is the Crucifixion, the Pantokrator and the Anastasis above the doors, while in the church the Theotokos (apse), Pentecost, scenes from Christ&#x27;s life and ermit St Loukas (all executed before 1048). The scenes are treated with a minimum of detail and the panels are dominated with the gold setting.
The Nea Moni Monastery on Chios was established by Constantine Monomachos in 1043–1056. The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived (Theotokos with raised hands, four evangelists with seraphim, scenes from Christ&#x27;s life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos). In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures, detail, landscape and setting.

Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem between 1042 and 1048. Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel, who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description: &quot;Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling, over the tribune. The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ. In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exaltation of Adam. In the apse the Ascension of Christ. The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar.&quot;

The Daphni Monastery houses the best preserved complex of mosaics from the early Comnenan period (ca. 1100) when the austere and hieratic manner typical for the Macedonian epoch and represented by the awesome Christ Pantocrator image inside the dome, was metamorphosing into a more intimate and delicate style, of which &quot;The Angel before St Joachim&quot; — with its pastoral backdrop, harmonious gestures and pensive lyricism – is considered a superb example.

The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks. The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets, saints and patriarchs. Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an &quot;Emperor kneeling before Christ&quot; (late 9th or early 10th century). Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the &quot;Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine&quot;. Justinian I is offering the model of the church to Mary while Constantine is holding a model of the city in his hand. Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded. A mosaic panel on the gallery shows &quot;Christ with Constantine Monomachos and Empress Zoe&quot; (1042–1055). The emperor gives a bulging money sack to Christ as a donation for the church.

The dome of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki is decorated with an &quot;Ascension&quot; mosaic (c. 885). The composition resembles the great baptistries in Ravenna, with apostles standing between palms and Christ in the middle. The scheme is somewhat unusual as the standard post-Iconoclastic formula for domes contained only the image of the Pantokrator.
There are very few existing mosaics from the Komnenian period but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression. The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in Constantinople is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor John II and Empress Eirene with the Theotokos (1122–34). The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing. It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name, &quot;Piroska&quot; shows. The adjacent portrait of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos on a pier (from 1122) is similarly personal. The imperial mausoleum of the Komnenos dynasty, the Pantokrator Monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed. The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent. There is only a &quot;Communion of the Apostles&quot; in the apse of the cathedral of Serres.

A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious, miniature mosaic icons. In these icons the small tesserae (with sides of 1 mm or less) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel. These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion. The Louvre Transfiguration is a very fine example from the late 12th century. The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at Florence illustrates the more gentle, humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century.
The sack of Constantinople in 1204 caused the decline of mosaic art for the next five decades. After the reconquest of the city by Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261 the Hagia Sophia was restored and a beautiful new &quot;Deesis&quot; was made on the south gallery. This huge mosaic panel with figures two and a half times lifesize is really overwhelming due to its grand scale and superlative craftsmanship. The Hagia Sophia &quot;Deesis&quot; is probably the most famous Byzantine mosaic in Constantinople.

The Pammakaristos Monastery was restored by Michael Glabas, an imperial official, in the late 13th century. Only the mosaic decoration of the small burial chapel (parekklesion) of Glabas survived. This domed chapel was built by his widow, Martha around 1304–08. In the miniature dome the traditional Pantokrator can be seen with twelve prophets beneath. Unusually the apse is decorated with a &quot;Deesis&quot;, probably due to the funerary function of the chapel.

The Church of the Holy Apostles in Thessaloniki was built in 1310–14. Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern. Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings. Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the Theotokos Paregoritissa Church in Arta. The church was established by the Despot of Epirus in 1294–96. In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator, with prophets and cherubim below.
The greatest mosaic work of the Palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the Chora Church in Constantinople. Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels, the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia. They were executed around 1320 by the command of Theodore Metochites. The esonarthex has two fluted domes, specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ. The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos. The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban, offering the model of the church to Christ. The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. These panels show the influence of the Italian trecento on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings, landscapes, figures.

The last Byzantine mosaic work was created for the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople in the middle of the 14th century. The great eastern arch of the cathedral collapsed in 1346, bringing down the third of the main dome. By 1355 not only the big Pantokrator image was restored but new mosaics were set on the eastern arch depicting the Theotokos, the Baptist and Emperor John V Palaiologos (discovered only in 1989).

In addition to the large-scale monuments several miniature mosaic icons of outstanding quality was produced for the Palaiologos court and nobles. The loveliest examples from the 14th century are &quot;Annunciation&quot; in the Victoria and Albert Museum and a mosaic diptych in the Cathedral Treasury of Florence representing the &quot;Twelve Feasts of the Church&quot;.

In the troubled years of the 15th century the fatally weakened empire could not afford luxurious mosaics. Churches were decorated with wall-paintings in this era and after the Turkish conquest.

====Rome in the High Middle Ages====

The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style, free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space. Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente, the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura. The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1140) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne, the first example of this iconographic scheme. A similar mosaic, the Coronation of the Virgin, decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore. It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295. The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288 to 1294 were thoroughly restored in 1884. The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini, the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century. Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290. These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts at perspective. There is an interesting mosaic medallion from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave. The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves.

The great &quot;Navicella&quot; mosaic (1305–1313) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter&#x27;s is attributed to Giotto di Bondone. The giant mosaic, commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi, was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard. It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter&#x27;s in the 17th century. Navicella means &quot;little ship&quot; referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon. Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art.

====Sicily====
The heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century. The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule. Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style, that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies. Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II, the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale.

The Cappella Palatina clearly shows evidence for blending the eastern and western styles. The dome (1142–42) and the eastern end of the church (1143–1154) were decorated with typical Byzantine mosaics i.e. Pantokrator, angels, scenes from the life of Christ. Even the inscriptions are written in Greek. The narrative scenes of the nave (Old Testament, life of Sts Peter and Paul) are resembling to the mosaics of the Old St. Peter&#x27;s and St. Paul&#x27;s Basilica in Rome (Latin inscriptions, 1154–66).

The Martorana church (decorated around 1143) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished. The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina, with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed, elongated angels. The Greek inscriptions, decorative patterns, and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina. The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily, dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ, was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel, the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia, the founder of the church.

In Cefalù (1148) only the high, French Gothic presbytery was covered with mosaics: the Pantokrator on the semidome of the apse and cherubim on the vault. On the walls are Latin and Greek saints, with Greek inscriptions.
The Monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy, covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae. This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King William II of Sicily. The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina. The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor. Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos.

The Cathedral of Palermo, rebuilt by Archbishop Walter in the same time (1172–85), was also decorated with mosaics but none of these survived except the 12th-century image of &quot;Madonna del Tocco&quot; above the western portal.

The cathedral of Messina, consecrated in 1197, was also decorated with a great mosaic cycle, originally on par with Cefalù and Monreale, but heavily damaged and restored many times later. In the left apse of the same cathedral 14th-century mosaics survived, representing the Madonna and Child between Saints Agata and Lucy, the Archangels Gabriel and Michael and Queens Eleonora and Elisabetta.

Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166, with mosaics tied into a tree of life, mostly still preserved. The scenes depict biblical characters, warrior kings, medieval beasts, allegories of the months and working activity. Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi&#x27;s Norman Cathedral. The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries.

The palaces of the Norman kings were decorated with mosaics depicting animals and landscapes. The secular mosaics are seemingly more Eastern in character than the great religious cycles and show a strong Persian influence. The most notable examples are the &quot;Sala di Ruggero&quot; in the Palazzo dei Normanni, Palermo and the &quot;Sala della Fontana&quot; in the Zisa summer palace, both from the 12th century.

====Venice====

In parts of Italy, which were under eastern artistic influences, like Sicily and Venice, mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages. The whole interior of the St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice is clad with elaborate, golden mosaics. The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries. The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century. One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark&#x27;s were based directly on the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis, a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople (1204). The mosaics were executed in the 1220s.

Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello from the 12th century, and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in Murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement (1140). The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary, St John and the two patron saints, Cipriano and Cipriana. When the church was demolished in the 19th century, the mosaic was bought by Frederick William IV of Prussia. It was reassembled in the Friedenskirche of Potsdam in the 1840s.

Trieste was also an important center of mosaic art. The mosaics in the apse of the Cathedral of San Giusto were laid by master craftsmen from Veneto in the 12th–13th centuries.

====Medieval Italy====
The monastery of Grottaferrata founded by Greek Basilian monks and consecrated by the Pope in 1024 was decorated with Italo-Byzantine mosaics, some of which survived in the narthex and the interior. The mosaics on the triumphal chancel arch portray the Twelve Apostles sitting beside an empty throne, evoking Christ&#x27;s ascent to Heaven. It is a Byzantine work of the 12th century. There is a beautiful 11th-century Deesis above the main portal.

The Abbot of Monte Cassino, Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church. According to chronicler Leo of Ostia the Greek artists decorated the apse, the arch and the vestibule of the basilica. Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds (now in the Monte Cassino Museum). &quot;The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts&quot; – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy.
In Florence a magnificiant mosaic of the Last Judgement decorates the dome of the Baptistery. The earliest mosaics, works of art of many unknown Venetian craftsmen (including probably Cimabue), date from 1225. The covering of the ceiling was probably not completed until the 14th century.

The impressive mosaic of Christ in Majesty, flanked by the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist in the apse of the cathedral of Pisa was designed by Cimabue in 1302. It evokes the Monreale mosaics in style. It survived the great fire of 1595 which destroyed most of the medieval interior decoration.

Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice (mainly from the 17th–19th centuries, but the oldest one from 1270 to 1275, &quot;The burial of St Mark in the first basilica&quot;), the Cathedral of Orvieto (golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century, many times redone) and the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca (huge, striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below, designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in the 13th century). The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the &quot;Blessing Christ&quot; (signed by one Solsternus from 1207).

====Western and Central Europe====
Beyond the Alps the first important example of mosaic art was the decoration of the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, commissioned by Charlemagne. It was completely destroyed in a fire in 1650. A rare example of surviving Carolingian mosaics is the apse semi-dome decoration of the oratory of Germigny-des-Prés built in 805–806 by Theodulf, bishop of Orléans, a leading figure of the Carolingian Renaissance. This unique work of art, rediscovered only in the 19th century, had no followers.

Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages. The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges, originally an important place of pilgrimage, was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s. A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century. It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble, probably taken from antique pavements. This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy, where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors. The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors. More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century.

Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe, although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals. The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár (Alba Regia) had a mosaic decoration in the apse. It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen, executed in the first decades of the 11th century. The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century. The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal. It was executed by Venetian craftsmen.
The Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence. During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones. Almost nothing of them survived except the &quot;Ascension of Christ&quot; in the Latin Chapel (now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics). More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ, Councils of the Church and angels. In the apses the Annunciation, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen. The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor, the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church.

In 2003, the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania. The panels depict real or fantastic animal, floral, solar and geometric representations. Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church, built some time between the 10th and 11th century. Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence. The monastery was situated at that time in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary.

====Renaissance and Baroque====
Although mosaics went out of fashion and were substituted by frescoes, some of the great Renaissance artists also worked with the old technique. Raphael&#x27;s Creation of the World in the dome of the Chigi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo is a notable example that was executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi di Pace.

During the papacy of Clement VIII (1592–1605), the &quot;Congregazione della Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro&quot; was established, providing an independent organisation charged with completing the decorations in the newly built St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Instead of frescoes the cavernous Basilica was mainly decorated with mosaics. Among the explanations are:
# The old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica had been decorated with mosaic, as was common in churches built during the early Christian era; the 17th century followed the tradition to enhance continuity.
# In a church like this with high walls and few windows, mosaics were brighter and reflected more light.
# Mosaics had greater intrinsic longevity than either frescoes or canvases.
# Mosaics had an association with bejeweled decoration, flaunting richness.

The mosaics of St. Peter&#x27;s often show lively Baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like Ciro Ferri, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Carlo Maratta, and many others. Raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting, the Transfiguration. Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter&#x27;s, including Giovanni Battista Calandra, Fabio Cristofari (died 1689), and Pietro Paolo Cristofari (died 1743). Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts.

====The Christian East====

The eastern provinces of the Eastern Roman and later the Byzantine Empires inherited a strong artistic tradition from Late Antiquity. Similar to Italy and Constantinople, churches and important secular buildings in the region of Syria and Egypt were decorated with elaborate mosaic panels between the 5th and 8th centuries. The great majority of these works of art were later destroyed, but archeological excavations unearthed many surviving examples.

The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the Madaba Map, made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at Madaba, Jordan. It was rediscovered in 1894. The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the Holy Land. It depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert. The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem, at the center of the map. The map is enriched with many naturalistic features, like animals, fishing boats, bridges and palm trees.
One of the earliest examples of Byzantine mosaic art in the region can be found on Mount Nebo, an important place of pilgrimage in the Byzantine era where Moses died. Among the many 6th-century mosaics in the church complex (discovered after 1933) the most interesting one is located in the baptistery. The intact floor mosaic covers an area of 9 × 3 m and was laid down in 530. It depicts hunting and pastoral scenes with rich Middle Eastern flora and fauna.

The Church of Sts. Lot and Procopius was founded in 567 in Nebo village under Mount Nebo (now Khirbet Mukhayyat). Its floor mosaic depicts everyday activities like grape harvest. Another two spectacular mosaics were discovered in the ruined Church of Preacher John nearby. One of the mosaics was placed above the other one which was completely covered and unknown until the modern restoration. The figures on the older mosaic have thus escaped the iconoclasts.

The town of Madaba remained an important center of mosaic making during the 5th–8th centuries. In the Church of the Apostles the middle of the main panel Thalassa, goddess of the sea, can be seen surrounded by fishes and other sea creatures. Native Middle Eastern birds, mammals, plants and fruits were also added.
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine&#x27;s Monastery is exceptional. On the upper wall Moses is shown in two panels on a landscape background. In the apse we can see the Transfiguration of Jesus on a golden background. The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets, and two contemporary figure, &quot;Abbot Longinos&quot; and &quot;John the Deacon&quot;. The mosaic was probably created in 565/6.

Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called &quot;Armenian Mosaic&quot; which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate. It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine&#x27;s branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: &quot;For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows.&quot; Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries. The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel.

An exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany, the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem. A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor.
The monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors. The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85. The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich. The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date (discovered in 1930). They were laid down in the Umayyad era, after a devastating earthquake in 659. Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features.
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered. The most important one was uncovered in 1990. It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual. The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century. In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed. They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals, and personifications of the Seasons, Ocean, Earth and Wisdom.

The Arab conquest of the Middle East in the 7th century did not break off the art of mosaic making. Arabs learned and accepted the craft as their own and carried on the classical tradition. During the Umayyad era Christianity retained its importance, churches were built and repaired and some of the most important mosaics of the Christian East were made during the 8th century when the region was under Islamic rule.

The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now Umm ar-Rasas) were made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) &quot;Church of Bishop Sergius.&quot; Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration.

The last great mosaics in Madaba were made in 767 in the Church of the Virgin Mary (discovered in 1887). It is a masterpiece of the geometric style with a Greek inscription in the central medallion.

With the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750 the Middle East went through deep cultural changes. No great mosaics were made after the end of the 8th century and the majority of churches gradually fell into disrepair and were eventually destroyed. The tradition of mosaic making died out among the Christians and also in the Islamic community.

====Orthodox countries====

The craft has also been popular in early medieval Rus, inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition. Yaroslav, the Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus&#x27; built a large cathedral in his capital, Kyiv. The model of the church was the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, and it was also called Saint Sophia Cathedral. It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen, sent by Constantine Monomachos, between 1037 and 1046. Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics. In the dome we can see the traditional stern Pantokrator supported by angels. Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives. The apse is dominated by an orant Theotokos with a Deesis in three medallions above. Below is a Communion of the Apostles.

Prince Sviatopolk II built St. Michael&#x27;s Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv in 1108. The mosaics of the church are undoubtedly works of Byzantine artists. Although the church was destroyed by Soviet authorities, majority of the panels were preserved. Small parts of ornamental mosaic decoration from the 12th century survived in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod but this church was largely decorated with frescoes.

Using mosaics and frescoes in the same building was a unique practice in Ukraine. Harmony was achieved by using the same dominant colors in mosaic and fresco. Both Saint Sophia Cathedral and Saint Michael&#x27;s Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv use this technique. Mosaics stopped being used for church decoration as early as the 12th century in the eastern Slavic countries. Later Russian churches were decorated with frescoes, similarly then orthodox churches in the Balkan.
The apse mosaic of the Gelati Monastery is a rare example of mosaic use in Georgia. Began by king David IV and completed by his son Demetrius I of Georgia, the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels. The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids. The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople. Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other, lesser known sites. The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the Pitsunda Cathedral have been inspired by Roman prototypes. In Tsromi the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme. Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text.

===Jewish mosaics===

Under Roman and Byzantine influence the Jews also decorated their synagogues with classical floor mosaics. Many interesting examples were discovered in Galilee and the Judean Desert.

The remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in Sepphoris, which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews, Christians and pagans. The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs. In the center of the floor the zodiac wheel was depicted. Helios sits in the middle, in his sun chariot, and each zodiac is matched with a Jewish month. Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes, such as the binding of Isaac, as well as traditional rituals, including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains.
Another zodiac mosaic decorated the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue which was built during the reign of Justin I (518–27). It is regarded one of the most important mosaics discovered in Israel. Each of its three panels depicts a scene – the Holy Ark, the zodiac, and the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. In the center of the zodiac is Helios, the sun god, in his chariot. The four women in the corners of the mosaic represent the four seasons.

A third superbly preserved zodiac mosaic was discovered in the Severus synagogue in the ancient resort town of Hammat Tiberias. In the center of the 4th-century mosaic the Sun god, Helios sits in his chariot holding the celestial sphere and a whip. Nine of the 12 signs of the zodiac survived intact. Another panel shows the Ark of Covenant and Jewish cultic objects used in the Temple at Jerusalem.

In 1936, a synagogue was excavated in Jericho which was named Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue after an inscription on its mosaic floor (&quot;Peace on Israel&quot;). It appears to have been in use from the 5th to 8th centuries and contained a big mosaic on the floor with drawings of the Ark of the Covenant, the Menorah, a Shofar and a Lulav. Nearby in Naaran, there is another synagogue (discovered in 1918) from the 6th century that also has a mosaic floor.

The synagogue in Eshtemoa (As-Samu) was built around the 4th century. The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns. The synagogue in Khirbet Susiya (excavated in 1971–72, founded in the end of the 4th century) has three mosaic panels, the eastern one depicting a Torah shrine, two menorahs, a lulav and an etrog with columns, deer and rams. The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted Daniel in the lion&#x27;s den. The Roman synagogue in Ein Gedi was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels. The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center. It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community.

The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine Gaza. In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area. Its mosaic floor depicts King David as Orpheus, identified by his name in Hebrew letters. Near him were lion cubs, a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre. A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves, each of which contains an animal: a lioness suckling her cub, a giraffe, peacocks, panthers, bears, a zebra and so on. The floor was paved in 508/509. It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon (Menois) and the Christian church at Shellal, suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places.

The House of Leontius in Bet She&#x27;an (excavated in 1964–72) is a rare example of a synagogue which was part of an inn. It was built in the Byzantine period. The colorful mosaic floor of the synagogue room had an outer stripe decorated with flowers and birds, around medallions with animals, created by vine trellises emerging from an amphora. The central medallion enclosed a menorah (candelabrum) beneath the word shalom (peace).
A 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue. Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols (menorah, lulav, etrog) but the inscriptions are Greek. Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She&#x27;an (excavated in 1960). The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule (shrine) with cultic symbols. The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town (see above). The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue. One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script.

In 2003, a synagogue of the 5th or 6th century was uncovered in the coastal Ionian town of Saranda, Albania. It had exceptional mosaics depicting items associated with Jewish holidays, including a menorah, ram&#x27;s horn, and lemon tree. Mosaics in the basilica of the synagogue show the facade of what resembles a Torah, animals, trees, and other biblical symbols. The structure measures 20 by 24 m. and was probably last used in the 6th century as a church.

=== Middle Eastern and Western Asian art ===

====Christian Arabia====
In South Arabia two mosaic works were excavated in a Qatabanian from the late 3rd century, those two plates formed geometric and grapevines formation reflecting the traditions of that culture. In the Ghassanid era religious mosaic art flourished in their territory, so far five churches with mosaic were recorded from that era, two built by Ghassanid rulers and the other three by the Christian Arab community who wrote their names and dedications.

====Zoroastrian Persia====
Tilework had been known there for about two thousand years when cultural exchange between Sassanid Empire and Romans influenced Persian artists to create mosaic patterns. Shapur I decorated his palace with tile compositions depicting dancers, musicians, courtesans, etc. This was the only significant example of figurative Persian mosaic, which became prohibited after Arab conquest and arrival of Islam.

====Islamic art====
=====Arab=====
Islamic architecture used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the Muslim conquests of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire. In Syria and Egypt the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art. During the Umayyad Dynasty mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of zellige and azulejo in various parts of the Arab world, although tile was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration.
The first great religious building of Islam, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which was built between 688 and 692, was decorated with glass mosaics both inside and outside, by craftsmen of the Byzantine tradition. Only parts of the original interior decoration survive. The rich floral motifs follow Byzantine traditions, and are &quot;Islamic only in the sense that the vocabulary is syncretic and does not include representation of men or animals.&quot;

The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, then capital of the Arab Caliphate. The mosque was built between 706 and 715. The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building. This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background. The mosaics include no human figures, which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works. The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard, called the &quot;Barada Panel&quot; after the river Barada. It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world, at over 4 m2. In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively, and many mosaics were lost, although some have been restored since.

The mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque gave inspiration to later Damascene mosaic works. The Dome of the Treasury, which stands in the mosque courtyard, is covered with fine mosaics, probably dating from 13th- or 14th-century restoration work. The style of them are strikingly similar to the Barada Panel. The mausoleum of Sultan Baibars, Madrassa Zahiriyah, which was built after 1277, is also decorated with a band of golden floral and architectural mosaics, running around inside the main prayer hall.

Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham&#x27;s Palace, Palestine which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deer peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar, Lebanon. The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat (in present-day Jordan) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill. The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by &quot;good&quot; animals on one side and &quot;bad&quot; animals on the other. Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls, grapes, pomegranates, oryx, wolves, hares, a leopard, pairs of partridges, fish, bulls, ostriches, rabbits, rams, goats, lions and a snake. At Qastal, near Amman, excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan, dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (685–705). They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor. The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns, trees, animals, fruits and rosettes. Except for the open courtyard, entrance and staircases, the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics.

Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain. The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character. They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen, supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople, who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain. The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy. The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus, which was lost for the Umayyad family.

Mosaics generally went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century. Similar effects were achieved by the use of painted tilework, either geometric with small tiles, sometimes called mosaic, like the zillij of North Africa, or larger tiles painted with parts of a large decorative scheme (Qashani) in Persia, Turkey and further east.
==Modern mosaics==
Noted 19th-century mosaics include those by Edward Burne-Jones at St Pauls within the Walls in Rome. Another modern mosaic of note is the world&#x27;s largest mosaic installation located at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, located in St. Louis, Missouri. A modern example of mosaic is the Museum of Natural History station of the New York City Subway (there are many such works of art scattered throughout the New York City subway system, though many IND stations are usually designed with bland mosaics). Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the rest areas along some Texas interstate highways.

Some modern mosaics are the work of &quot;modernisme&quot; style architects Antoni Gaudí and Josep Maria Jujol, for example the mosaics in the Park Güell in Barcelona. Today, among the leading figures of the mosaic world are Elaine M. Goodwin (UK), Felice Nittolo (Italy), Brit Hammer (Netherlands), Dugald MacInnes (Scotland), Heather Hancock (USA), Kelley Knickerbocker (USA), Aida Valencia (Mexico), Emma Biggs (UK), Helen Nock (UK), Marcelo de Melo (Brazil), Sonia King (USA) and Saimir Strati (Albania).

===As a popular craft===

Mosaics have developed into a popular craft and art, and are not limited to professionals. Today&#x27;s artisans and crafters work with stone, ceramics, smalti, shells, art glass, mirror, beads, and even odd items like doll parts, pearls, or photographs. While ancient mosaics tended to be architectural, modern mosaics are found covering everything from park benches and flowerpots to guitars and bicycles. Items can be as small as an earring or as large as a house.

Trencadís or pique assiette (a French term – &quot;stolen from plate&quot;) is a mosaic made from pieces of broken pottery, china, glass, buttons, figurines, or jewelry which are cemented onto a base to create a new surface. Almost any form can be used as a base, and any combination of pieces can be applied, restricted only by the individual creator&#x27;s imagination.
===In street art===

In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and pop culture as to traditional mosaic, street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork. The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader. He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles, the first of which are small &quot;traditional&quot; tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character, installed in cities across the globe, and the second of which are a style he refers to as &quot;Rubikcubism&quot;, which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. Although he is the most prominent, other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well.

===Calçada Portuguesa===
Portuguese pavement (in Portuguese, &quot;Calçada Portuguesa&quot;) is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal, and common throughout the Lusosphere. Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex, it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design. In Portuguese-speaking countries, many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even, though far more occasionally, streets done in this mosaic form. Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style.

Despite its prevalence and popularity throughout Portugal and its former colonies, and its relation to older art and architectural styles like Azulejo, Portuguese and Spanish painted tilework, it is a relatively young mosaic artform, its first definitive appearance in a modernly recognizable form being in the mid-1800s. Among the most commonly used stones in this style are basalt and limestone.
==Terminology==

Mosaic is an art form which uses small pieces of materials placed together to create a unified whole. The materials commonly used are marble or other stone, glass, pottery, mirror or foil-backed glass, or shells.

The word &quot;mosaic&quot; is from the Italian &quot;mosaico&quot; deriving from the Latin &quot;mosaicus&quot; and ultimately from the Greek &quot;mouseios&quot; meaning &quot;belonging to the Muses&quot;, hence artistic. Each piece of material is a &quot;tessera&quot; (plural: &quot;tesserae&quot;). The space in between where the grout goes is an interstice. Andamento is the word used to describe the movement and flow of tesserae. The &#x27;opus&#x27;, the Latin for &#x27;work&#x27;, is the way in which the pieces are cut and placed.

Common techniques include:
* Opus regulatum: A grid; all tesserae align both vertically and horizontally.
* Opus tessellatum: Tesserae form vertical or horizontal rows, but not both.
* Opus vermiculatum: One or more lines of tesserae follow the edge of a special shape (letters or a major central graphic).
* Opus musivum: Vermiculatum extends throughout the entire background.
* Opus palladianum: Instead of forming rows, tesserae are irregularly shaped. Also known as &quot;crazy paving&quot;.
* Opus sectile: A major shape (e.g. heart, letter, cat) is formed by a single tessera, as later in pietra dura.
* Opus classicum: When vermiculatum is combined with tessellatum or regulatum.
* Opus circumactum: Tesserae are laid in overlapping semicircles or fan shapes.
* Micromosaic: using very small tesserae, in Byzantine icons and Italian panels for jewellery from the Renaissance on.

==Three techniques==
There are three main methods: the direct method, the indirect method and the double indirect method.

===Direct method===

The direct method of mosaic construction involves directly placing (gluing) the individual tesserae onto the supporting surface. This method is well suited to surfaces that have a three-dimensional quality, such as vases. This was used for the historic European wall and ceiling mosaics, following underdrawings of the main outlines on the wall below, which are often revealed again when the mosaic falls away.

The direct method suits small projects that are transportable. Another advantage of the direct method is that the resulting mosaic is progressively visible, allowing for any adjustments to tile color or placement.

The disadvantage of the direct method is that the artist must work directly at the chosen surface, which is often not practical for long periods of time, especially for large-scale projects. Also, it is difficult to control the evenness of the finished surface. This is of particular importance when creating a functional surface such as a floor or a table top.

A modern version of the direct method, sometimes called &quot;double direct,&quot; is to work directly onto fiberglass mesh. The mosaic can then be constructed with the design visible on the surface and transported to its final location. Large work can be done in this way, with the mosaic being cut up for shipping and then reassembled for installation. It enables the artist to work in comfort in a studio rather than at the site of installation.

===Indirect method===
The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects, projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes. Tesserae are applied face-down to a backing paper using a water-soluble adhesive. Once the mosaic is completed in the studio it is transferred in sections to the site and cemented, paper facing outwards. Once fixed the paper is dampened and removed. This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas, allows the cementing of the tesserae to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses. Mosaic murals, benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method, as it results in a smoother and more even surface.

==Mathematics==
The best way to arrange variously shaped tiles on a surface leads to the mathematical field of tessellation.

The artist M. C. Escher was influenced by Moorish mosaics to begin his investigations into tessellation. 

==Digital imaging==

A photomosaic is a picture made up of various other pictures (pioneered by Joseph Francis), in which each &quot;pixel&quot; is another picture, when examined closely. This form has been adopted in many modern media and digital image searches.

A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles, arranged in a non-overlapping fashion, e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor, by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles (a typical size is , as for example, on the floor of the University of Toronto pool, though sometimes larger tiles such as are used). These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text, such as the depth of the pool in various places, but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme.

Recent developments in digital image processing have led to the ability to design physical tile mosaics using computer aided design (CAD) software. The software typically takes as inputs a source bitmap and a palette of colored tiles. The software makes a best-fit match of the tiles to the source image. In order to place tiles in the manner of opus vermiculatum the first step is to find edges of visually important objects in the image. A Python implementation of a complete pixel image to mosaic vector image algorithm is available.
==Robotic manufacturing==
With high cost of labor in developed countries, production automation has become increasingly popular. Rather than being assembled by hand, mosaics designed using computer aided design (CAD) software can be assembled by a robot. Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy. But these &quot;computer&quot; mosaics have a different look than hand-made &quot;artisanal&quot; mosaics. With robotic production, colored tiles are loaded into , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software.

<text>Stirling (; ; ) is a city in central Scotland, northeast of Glasgow and north-west of Edinburgh. The market town, surrounded by rich farmland, grew up connecting the royal citadel, the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen, the Old Bridge and the port. Located on the River Forth, Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area, and is traditionally the county town and historic county of Stirlingshire. Stirling&#x27;s key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south. It has been said that &quot;Stirling, like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together&quot;. The city&#x27;s status as &quot;Gateway to the Highlands&quot; also historically lent it great strategic importance—the credo &quot;he who holds Stirling, holds Scotland&quot; is sometimes attributed to Robert the Bruce.

When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway, according to a 9th-century legend, it was attacked by Danish invaders. The sound of a wolf roused a sentry, however, who alerted his garrison, which forced a Viking retreat. This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug. The area is today known as Wolfcraig. Even today the wolf appears with a goshawk on the council&#x27;s coat of arms along with the recently chosen motto: &quot;Steadfast as the Rock&quot;.

Once the capital of Scotland, Stirling is visually dominated by Stirling Castle. Stirling also has a medieval parish church, the Church of the Holy Rude, where, on 29 July 1567, the infant James VI was anointed King of Scots by Adam Bothwell, the Bishop of Orkney, with the service concluding after a sermon by John Knox. The poet King was educated by George Buchanan and grew up in Stirling. He was later also crowned King of England and Ireland on 25 July 1603, bringing closer the countries of the United Kingdom. Modern Stirling is a centre for local government, higher education, tourism, retail, and industry. The mid-2012 census estimate for the population of the city is 36,440; the wider Stirling council area has a population of about 93,750.

One of the principal royal strongholds of the Kingdom of Scotland, Stirling was created a royal burgh by King David I in 1130. In 2002, as part of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, Stirling was granted city status.
== Name(s) and etymology==
Stirling&#x27;s name appears as &quot;Strivelin(g)&quot; in early sources, later becoming &quot;Stirveling&quot; and finally &quot;Stirling&quot;. Its meaning, and even its language of origin, are a matter of debate. In 1930, J. B. Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Place-Names of Scotland&quot; suggested a Brittonic origin, and the name was thought likely to be Brittonic by most commentators thereafter. However, in a comprehensive survey of the evidence in 2017, Thomas Owen Clancy showed that a Brittonic etymology is unlikely, and derived the name from Gaelic &quot;srib-linn&quot;, meaning &quot;pool in the river&quot;.

A geographical survey of Britain in the eighth-century &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; by Bede also mentions a place called &quot;urbs Giudi&quot; (&quot;the town of &quot;Giudi&quot;&quot;). Although its location is not certain, a 2023 study found that &quot;Stirling is the location of &quot;urbs Giudi&quot; favoured by most scholars&quot;, and itself supported this identification. This name is thought etymologically to be Celtic. The ninth-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; mentions a similar-looking battle-site called &quot;urbs Iudeu&quot;, which many scholars have assumed was the same as Bede&#x27;s &quot;urbs Giudi&quot;, but this identification is uncertain.

== History ==
===Ancient history===
A stone cist, found in Coneypark Nursery in 1879, is Stirling&#x27;s oldest catalogued artefact. Bones from the cist were radiocarbon dated and found to be over four millennia old, originating within the date range 2152 to 2021 BC. Nicknamed Torbrex Tam, the man, whose bones were discovered by workmen, died while still in his twenties. Other Bronze Age finds near the city come from the area around Cambusbarron. It had been thought that the Randolphfield standing stones were more than 3000 years old but recent radiocarbon dating suggests they may date from the time of Bruce. 
The earliest known structures in Stirling are now destroyed but comprised two Neolithic Cursus in Bannockburn. To the south of Stirling is Gillies Hill which contains a series of prehistoric fortifications. Two structures are known: what is currently called Wallstale Dun on the southern end of Touchadam Craig, and Gillies Hill fort on the northwest end of the craig. Both structures were built by Iron Age peoples and Gillies Hill is c 2500 years old while the Wallstale structure is later and is related in form to brochs, these appear to coincide with the Roman period and there are around 40 or so in the wider area. South of the city, the King&#x27;s Park prehistoric carvings (cup and ring marks) can still be found, these date to c 3000 BC. 

===Roman and early Medieval===
Its other notable geographic feature is its proximity to the lowest site of subjugation of the River Forth. Control of the bridge brought military advantage in times of unrest and excise duty, or pontage dues, in peacetime. Unsurprisingly excise men were installed in a covered booth in the centre of the bridge to collect tax from any entering the royal burgh with goods. Stirling remained the river&#x27;s lowest reliable crossing point (that is, without a weather-dependent ferry or seasonal ford) until the construction of the Alloa Swing Bridge between Throsk and Alloa in 1885.

The city has two Latin mottoes, which appeared on the earliest burgh seal of which an impression of 1296 is on record. The first alludes to the story as recorded by Boece who relates that in 855 Scotland was invaded by two Northumbrian princes, Osbrecht and Ella. They united their forces with the Cumbrian Britons in order to defeat the Scots. Having secured Stirling castle, they built the first stone bridge over the Forth.

On the top they reportedly raised a crucifix with the inscription: &quot;Anglos, a Scotis separat, crux ista remotis; Arma hic stant Bruti; stant Scoti hac sub cruce tuti.&quot; Bellenden translated this loosely as &quot;I am free marche, as passengers may ken, To Scottis, to Britonis, and to Inglismen.&quot; It may be the stone cross was a tripoint for the three kingdom&#x27;s borders or marches; the cross functioning both as a dividing territorial marker, and as a uniting witness stone like in the Bible story in Joshua 22. &quot;Angles and Scots here demarked, By this cross kept apart. Brits and Scots armed stand near, By this cross stand safe here.&quot; This would make the cross on the centre of the first stone bridge the Heart of Scotland.

The Stirling seal has only the second part, in a slightly different form:

:Hic Armis Bruti Scoti Stant Hic Cruce Tuti 
:(&quot;Brits and Scots armed and near, by this cross stand safe here.&quot;)

Apparently the Latin is not first rate having four syllables in &quot;cruce tuti&quot; but the meaning seems to be that the Lowland Strathclyde Britons on the southern shore and the Highland Pictish Scots on the northern shore stand protected from each other by their common Christianity.

A more modern translation suggests that rather than Briton, bruit might be better read as brute, i.e. brute Scots, implying a non-Scots identity was retained in Stirling for some time after inclusion into the land controlled by the King of Scots.

The second motto is:
:Continet Hoc in Se Nemus et Castrum Strivelinse 
:(&quot;Contained within this seal pressed down, the wood an&#x27; castle o&#x27; Stirlin&#x27; town.&quot;)

It has been claimed that the &quot;Bridge&quot; seal was regarded as the Burgh seal proper, the &quot;Castle&quot; seal being simply a reverse, used when the seal was affixed by a lace to a charter. This agrees with a description in an official publication (which spells Bruti with only one letter t). Clearer images are available with different lettering. Sibbald conflated the two mottos into a single rhyme; he gave no indication that he was aware of Boece&#x27;s work.

Stirling was first declared a royal burgh by King David in the 12th century, with later charters reaffirmed by subsequent monarchs. A ferry, and later bridge, on the River Forth at Stirling brought wealth and strategic influence, as did its tidal port at Riverside. Major battles during the Wars of Scottish Independence took place at the Stirling Old Bridge in 1297 and at the nearby village of Bannockburn in 1314 involving Andrew Moray and William Wallace, and Robert the Bruce respectively. After the Battle of Stirling Bridge, Moray and Wallace wrote to Hanseatic League leaders in Lübeck and Hamburg to encourage trade between Scottish and German ports. There were also several Sieges of Stirling Castle in the conflict, notably in 1304.

===Late Medieval and early Modern===

Another important historical site in the area is the ruins of Cambuskenneth Abbey, the resting place of King James III of Scotland and his queen, Margaret of Denmark. The king died at the Battle of Sauchieburn by forces nominally led by his son and successor James IV. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the Battle of Stirling also took place in the centre of Stirling on 12 September 1648. The fortifications continued to play a strategic military role during the 18th-century Jacobite risings. In 1715, the Earl of Mar failed to take control of the castle. In January 1746, the army of Bonnie Prince Charlie seized control of the town but failed to take the Castle. On their consequent retreat northwards, they blew up the church of St. Ninians where they had been storing munitions; only the tower survived and can be seen to this day. The castle and the church are shown on Blaeu&#x27;s map of 1654 which was derived from Pont&#x27;s earlier map.Standing near the castle, the Church of the Holy Rude is one of the town&#x27;s most historically important buildings. Founded in 1129 it is the second oldest building in the city after Stirling castle. It was rebuilt in the 15th-century after Stirling suffered a catastrophic fire in 1405, and is reputed to be the only surviving church in the United Kingdom apart from Westminster Abbey to have held a coronation. The death of James V led to the Rough Wooing, a period where Henry VIII of England attempted to marry the infant Mary Queen of Scots to his son. Stirling responded by constructing a burgh wall to the south of town, which is among the best preserved in Scotland. Recent archaeological research has identified two new bastions or positions of strength on the wall and Stirling&#x27;s last surviving medieval gate. On 29 July 1567 the infant son of Mary, Queen of Scots, was anointed James VI of Scotland in the church. James&#x27; bride, Anne of Denmark was crowned in the church at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh. The Holy Rude congregation still meet and some 19th century parish records survive. Musket shot marks that may come from Cromwell&#x27;s troops during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms are clearly visible on the tower and apse of the church. There are also musket scars on a gravestone in the cemetery indicating the troop movement to the castle.

Economically, the city&#x27;s port supported foreign trade, historically doing significant trade in the Low Countries, particularly with Bruges in Belgium and Veere in the Netherlands. In the 16th century there were so many Scots in Danzig in Prussia that they had their own church congregation and trade is mentioned with that city in Stirling Council&#x27;s minutes of 1560. Around John Cowane&#x27;s time there is an account which states there were about 30,000 Scots families living in Poland although that was possibly an exaggeration. Trade with the Baltic also took place such as a timber trade with Norway.

After the Jacobite threat had faded but before the railways were established, the Highland cattle drovers would use the Auld Brig on their way to market at Falkirk or Stenhousemuir. Three times a year, tens of thousands of cattle, sheep and ponies were moved together to the trysts in the south with some drovers going as far as Carlisle or even London&#x27;s Smithfield. There is a record of a four-mile long tailback (of livestock) developing from St. Ninians to Bridge of Allan after a St. Ninians tollman had a dispute.

===Victorian and Modern===

In the early 19th century an &quot;exceedingly low&quot; cost steamboat service used to run between Stirling and Newhaven or Granton. The coming of the railways in 1848 started the decline of the river traffic, not least because the Alloa Swing Bridge downstream restricted access for shipping. The railways did provide opportunity too with one Riverside company selling their reaping machines as far afield as Syria and Australia. Similarly, in 1861, a company making baby carriages was set up. These prams were exported to Canada, South America, India and South Africa.

The Princes Street drill hall was completed in 1908 and the Municipal Buildings, which formed the headquarters of Stirling Burgh Council for much of the 20th century, were completed in 1918.

After the blockades of the World Wars there was some increase in the use of the port including a tea trade with India. However, with normal shipping lanes open, the growth of the railways including The Forth Rail Bridge, left the harbour uneconomical and by the mid 20th century the port had ceased to operate.
==Governance==

In terms of local government, the city of Stirling is a part of the wider Stirling Council area, which is based at Old Viewforth and governs on matters of local administration as set out by the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994. The current members of the Council were voted in 2017 for a term of office of 5 years. The May 2017 local government election resulted in the Scottish Conservative party and Scottish National Party each winning nine councillors, while the Labour Party won four seats and the Scottish Green Party won one. However, subsequently one Conservative councillor left the party to sit as an Independent. The Provost of Stirling is Cllr Christine Simpson.

For the purposes of the Scottish Parliament, the city of Stirling forms part of the Stirling constituency of the Scottish Parliament constituency. The Stirling Scottish Parliament (or &quot;Holyrood&quot;) constituency created in 1999 is one of nine within the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation. The constituency&#x27;s Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) is Evelyn Tweed of the Scottish National Party (SNP).

In terms of national government, the city of Stirling forms part of the county constituency of Stirling and Strathallan, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the parliament of the United Kingdom by first past the post system. Chris Kane of the Labour Party has been the MP for Stirling and Strathallan since the 2024 general election, when the seat was first contested - prior to this, Stirling was part of the constituency of Stirling.

Historical voting records can be found in online databases.

==Geography==
Stirling is renowned as the &quot;Gateway to the Highlands&quot; and is generally regarded as occupying a strategic position at the point where the flatter, largely undulating Scottish Lowlands meet the rugged slopes of the Highlands along the Highland Boundary Fault. The starkness of this contrast is evidenced by the many hills and mountains of the lower Highlands such as Ben Vorlich and Ben Ledi which can be seen to the northwest of the city. On the other hand, the Carse of Stirling, stretching to the west and east of the city, is one of the flattest and most agriculturally productive expanses of land in the whole of Scotland.

The land surrounding Stirling has been most affected by glacial erosion and deposition. The city itself has grown up around its castle which stands atop an ancient quartz-dolerite sill, known as the Stirling Sill, a major defensive position which was at the lowest crossing point on the River Forth. Stirling stands on the Forth at the point where the river widens and becomes tidal. To the east of the city the Ochil Hills dominate the skyline with the highest peak in the range being Ben Cleuch, although Dumyat is more noticeable from Stirling. The Ochils meet the flat carse (floodplain) of the River Forth to the east of the distinctive geographical feature of Abbey Craig, a crag and tail hill upon which stands the 220 ft (67 m) high National Wallace Monument.

===Areas of Stirling===
Top of the Town consists of Broad Street, Castle Wynd, Ballengeich Pass, Lower Castle Hill Road, Darnley Street, Baker Street (formerly Baxters St), St John Street and St Mary&#x27;s Wynd. These streets all lead up to Stirling Castle and are the favourite haunt of tourists who stop off at the Old Town Jail, Mar&#x27;s Wark, Argyll&#x27;s Lodging and the castle. Ballengeich Pass leads to the graveyard at Ballengeich and the Castle Wynd winds past the old graveyard. The Top of the Town from Broad Street upwards is renowned for its cobblestoned roads, and cars can be heard rattling over the cobblestones on the way down. Craft shops and tourist-focused shops are evident on the way up and once at the top, panoramic views are available across Stirling and beyond.

===Climate===
Like most of the United Kingdom, Stirling has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild summers and cool, wet winters. Stirling has some of the warmest summers in all of Scotland, being relatively far away from the cooling effects of the North Sea and the Firth of Clyde.

In 2022, the settlement of Stirling had a population of 92,600, reflecting a 2.6% increase from the 48,440 recorded in the 2012 census.

The age distribution in Stirling showed that 16.7% of the population was under 15 years old, which is slightly higher than Scotland&#x27;s average of 15%. Additionally, Stirling had a larger proportion of residents of pensionable age, with 20.41% of the population being 65 or older, compared to the Scottish average of 20.1%.

Historical records also exist both in book form and in online databases.

==Culture==
Walking the Marches is a custom probably started in the 12th century. The only way the town&#x27;s boundaries could be protected was to walk round inspecting them annually. The walk was followed by a dinner. This was traditionally done by the Birlaw men made up from members of the Seven Trades, the Guildry and Council. In 2014 the tradition was revived after an official abeyance of several years. It now takes place on the last Saturday in May and is open for all to take part in.

There are about sixteen libraries and two mobile libraries in Stirling. The Smith Art Gallery and Museum is now free to tourists and residents alike. Shearer&#x27;s 1895 Penny Guide to Stirling and Neighbourhood used to list it under &quot;How to spend a few hours on a wet day&quot;.
The Macrobert Arts Centre has a variety of exhibitions and performances. There are many events at the Stirling Tolbooth and at The Albert Halls.
Stirling has hosted the National Mòd several times: in 1909, 1961, 1971 and 1987.

==Economy==
With Stirling&#x27;s development as a market town and its location as the focus of transport and communications in the region, it has developed a substantial retail sector serving a wide range of surrounding communities as well as the city itself. Primarily centred on the city centre, there are a large number of chain stores, as well as the Thistles shopping centre. However this has been augmented by out-of-town developments such as the Springkerse Retail Park on the city bypass to the east of Stirling.

A major new regeneration project on the site of the former port area and the former Ministry of Defence site, adjacent to Stirling Railway Station, is currently underway. Known as Forthside, it has the aim of developing a new waterfront district linked to the railway station via Forthside Bridge. The development comprises retail, residential and commercial elements, including a conference centre, hotel and Vue multiplex cinema, that will ultimately expand the city centre area, linking it to the River Forth, which has been cut off from the city centre area since the construction of the A9 bypass under the railway station in the 1960s.

In the service sector, financial services as well as tourism are the biggest employers. The financial services and insurance company Scottish Amicable Life Assurance, now part of Prudential, established a large and base at Craigforth on the outskirts of Stirling in the 1970s.

In terms of tourism, the presence of such historical monuments as Stirling Castle and the Wallace Monument and other nearby attractions like Blair Drummond Safari Park has bolstered Stirling&#x27;s position as a significant tourist destination in Scotland.

The University of Stirling and Stirling Council are two of the biggest employers in the area. Knowledge related industries, research and development as well as life sciences have clustered around the university in the Stirling University Innovation Park, close to its main campus.

Mauchline ware started producing wooden snuff-boxes in 1790 in Mauchline, Ayrshire. They were produced of the wood from the trees from the Castle craig. Today they are highly collectible.

Stirling is home to national construction companies Ogilvie Group, chaired by Duncan Ogilvie, who was listed in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; as being worth £32 million in 2009.

A Bank of Scotland survey in 2009 found that workers in Stirling had the highest average earnings of £716 a week.

==Transport==

The City of Stirling is home to a large number of commuters but has fewer commuting to work in other areas, than travel into the city. About half of Scotland&#x27;s population live within an hour&#x27;s travel time of Stirling.

Local bus services to districts within the city are almost completely provided by buses operated by McGill&#x27;s Scotland East. The surrounding towns, like Bridge of Allan, Alloa, Falkirk and Glasgow via Cumbernauld have services from the bus station.

Coaches to many Scottish towns and cities also run regularly.

There are also railway links from Stirling railway station, including inter-city rail services to Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh Waverley, Inverness, Glasgow Queen Street, and London King&#x27;s Cross. Services to Alloa, Bridge of Allan, Falkirk and Dunblane also run. Stirling Council provides some approximate journey times. Working lines include the Highland Main Line, the Edinburgh–Dunblane line and the Croy Line. The station formerly provided direct railway services to Callander and Oban, and to Loch Lomond, over very scenic lines, and a fast service to Dunfermline.

Cities with motorways links close to Stirling include Glasgow, via the M80 motorway past Cumbernauld, and Edinburgh, via the M9 motorway past Falkirk. To the north, the M9 provides access to Dunblane with easy links to Perth and further beyond the Central Belt.

Stirling has no airport, but there are international airports at Glasgow and Edinburgh which can be reached within an hour. Light aircraft can be chartered at Cumbernauld Airport.

Stirling used to have steamboats which carried hundreds of passengers a day. There is currently no working port at Stirling but there are plans to develop the river and the harbour which might include links with towns on the Firth of Forth. Since the Forth is tidal at Stirling, development of pontoon style landing stages could potentially allow river taxis and tourist boats to operate during the summer.

==Media==

Local radio stations are community based radio stations: CastleSound and Air3 Radio, which is a student-run station that broadcasts from the University of Stirling. 
The Stirling News and Stirling Observer are the local newspapers in the city. 

==Sports and recreation==
Stirling is home to professional league teams in football, rugby and cricket. The first Stirling Scottish Marathon was held on 21 May 2017. The National Curling Academy is located in Stirling Sports Village. It was opened in 2017 by Eve Muirhead. They use facilities linked to The Peak. It was hoped this would increase the chances of British medals at events like the Winter Olympics and Paralympics.

The senior football team, Stirling Albion, play in the Scottish League Two at their home ground at Forthbank Stadium. In July 2010, the Stirling Albion Supporters&#x27; Trust successfully took over the running of the club buying out the long-serving chairman, Peter McKenzie, after 14 months of campaigning. This made Stirling Albion the first fully owned community club in the history of British football, after previous attempts made by Manchester United, Liverpool and Rangers. Stirling University L.F.C. are the premier women&#x27;s football team. They play in the Scottish Women&#x27;s Premier League. Their home ground is The Gannochy Sports Centre at University of Stirling. Scotland international footballers Billy Bremner, John Colquhoun, Duncan Ferguson, female footballer Frankie Brown and brothers Gary and Steven Caldwell were born in Stirling. So were rugby internationals Kenny Logan, Ally Hogg and Alison McGrandles, jockey Willie Carson, and cricketer Dougie Brown.

Stirling County currently play in rugby&#x27;s Scottish Premiership Division One. Stirling Knights Basketball Team are based at the Peak at Forthbank beside Forthbank Stadium. The athletics team Central Athletic Club are based at the University of Stirling. The University Stirling Wanderers Hockey Club have also moved to a brand new (international standard) pitch at Forthbank for season 2008–09.

Next to this pitch there is also the ground of Stirling County Cricket Club, whose pavilion captured an architectural award in June 2009, three years after its opening.

The University of Stirling is a major centre of sports training and education in Scotland. It was designated as Scotland&#x27;s University for Sporting Excellence by the Scottish Government in 2008. The headquarters of the Scottish Institute of Sport is a purpose-built facility on the campus which opened in 2002. Also at the university is the Scottish National Swimming Academy, where Rio 2016, Olympic silver medalists and students at the university, Duncan Scott and Robbie Renwick trained. Commonwealth gold medalist Ross Murdoch, who also competed at Rio 2106, is a student at the university. The Gannochy National Tennis centre, which is seen as a tennis centre of excellence, was where Andy Murray and his brother Jamie Murray honed their skills as juniors. Gordon Reid, wheel chair Olympic gold medalist in 2016, was a tennis scholar at the university. The university men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf teams are consistently ranked among the best in Europe.

The university has a dedicated sports studies department, which is within the Faculty of Health Science and Sport, and is ranked amongst the best in the United Kingdom for its provision of sports facilities, with the maximum 5-star award, shared by 16 other universities in the UK. The University of Stirling also currently hosts the Scottish men&#x27;s lacrosse champions. Stirling and its surrounding area has a number of 9- and 18-hole golf courses, the largest of which is the Stirling Golf Course, located in the Kings Park area of the city. The Peak, a new Sports Village, was opened in April 2009 to cater for a range of sporting activities.

In June 2014, Stirling became the home of Scottish cricket after an agreement between Stirling County Cricket Club, Cricket Scotland and Stirling Council. It is hoped that the redevelopment of the ground will start at end 2014 with the intention being to upgrade it to international match standards. Scotland will play the majority of their home international games at the ground, starting with the World T20 qualifiers in the summer of 2015. The development will see a new pavilion and indoor training facility built at New Williamfield, the home of Stirling County Cricket Club, with Cricket Scotland relocating its headquarters from the National Cricket Academy at Ravelston, Edinburgh.

==Education==
The University of Stirling opened in 1967 on a greenfield site outside the town. Currently there are 11,100 students studying at the university, of which 7,995 are undergraduates and 3,105 are postgraduates. There are 120 nationalities represented on the university campus, with 19% of students coming from overseas. It has grown into a major research centre, with a large Innovation Park located immediately adjacent to the main university campus. Innovation Park has grown since its initiation in 1993, and is now home to 40 companies engaging in various forms of research and development. In January 2008 it was announced that students from Singapore would be able to gain degrees in retail from the University of Stirling in a tie-up with the country&#x27;s Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP). Stirling is also home to part of the wider Forth Valley College which was formed on 1 August 2005 from the merger of Falkirk, Stirling and Clackmannan colleges.

There are four main high schools in Stirling itself – Stirling High School, with a school roll of 964 pupils, Wallace High School with 958 pupils, St Modan&#x27;s High School with 912 pupils, and Bannockburn High School in Broomridge with 752 pupils. All the city&#x27;s secondary school premises have been redeveloped as a result of a Public-private partnership scheme. Stirling also has a Gaelic-medium unit situated in the city&#x27;s Riverside Primary School which teaches pupils from across Stirling and Clackmannanshire through the medium of Scottish Gaelic. Queen Victoria School, an agency of the Ministry of Defence, is in Stirling.

<doc id="61316" wikidata="Q92552" url="?curid=61316" title="Galois theory">
<text>In mathematics, Galois theory, originally introduced by Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. This connection, the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, allows reducing certain problems in field theory to group theory, which makes them simpler and easier to understand.

Galois introduced the subject for studying roots of polynomials. This allowed him to characterize the polynomial equations that are solvable by radicals in terms of properties of the permutation group of their roots—an equation is by definition &quot;solvable by radicals&quot; if its roots may be expressed by a formula involving only integers, th roots, and the four basic arithmetic operations. This widely generalizes the Abel–Ruffini theorem, which asserts that a general polynomial of degree at least five cannot be solved by radicals. 

Galois theory has been used to solve classic problems including showing that two problems of antiquity cannot be solved as they were stated (doubling the cube and trisecting the angle), and characterizing the regular polygons that are constructible (this characterization was previously given by Gauss but without the proof that the list of constructible polygons was complete; all known proofs that this characterization is complete require Galois theory).

Galois&#x27; work was published by Joseph Liouville fourteen years after his death. The theory took longer to become popular among mathematicians and to be well understood.

Galois theory has been generalized to Galois connections and Grothendieck&#x27;s Galois theory.

==Application to classical problems==

The birth and development of Galois theory was caused by the following question, which was one of the main open mathematical questions until the beginning of 19th century:

The Abel–Ruffini theorem provides a counterexample proving that there are polynomial equations for which such a formula cannot exist. Galois&#x27; theory provides a much more complete answer to this question, by explaining why it &quot;is&quot; possible to solve some equations, including all those of degree four or lower, in the above manner, and why it is not possible for most equations of degree five or higher. Furthermore, it provides a means of determining whether a particular equation can be solved that is both conceptually clear and easily expressed as an algorithm.

Galois&#x27; theory also gives a clear insight into questions concerning problems in compass and straightedge construction. It gives an elegant characterization of the ratios of lengths that can be constructed with this method. Using this, it becomes relatively easy to answer such classical problems of geometry as
# Which regular polygons are constructible?
# Why is it not possible to trisect every angle using a compass and a straightedge?
# Why is doubling the cube not possible with the same method?

== History ==
=== Pre-history ===
Galois&#x27; theory originated in the study of symmetric functions – the coefficients of a monic polynomial are (up to sign) the elementary symmetric polynomials in the roots. For instance, , where 1, and are the elementary polynomials of degree 0, 1 and 2 in two variables.

This was first formalized by the 16th-century French mathematician François Viète, in Viète&#x27;s formulas, for the case of positive real roots. In the opinion of the 18th-century British mathematician Charles Hutton, the expression of coefficients of a polynomial in terms of the roots (not only for positive roots) was first understood by the 17th-century French mathematician Albert Girard; Hutton writes:
...[Girard was] the first person who understood the general doctrine of the formation of the coefficients of the powers from the sum of the roots and their products. He was the first who discovered the rules for summing the powers of the roots of any equation.

In this vein, the discriminant is a symmetric function in the roots that reflects properties of the roots – it is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root, and for quadratic and cubic polynomials it is positive if and only if all roots are real and distinct, and negative if and only if there is a pair of distinct complex conjugate roots. See Discriminant:Nature of the roots for details.

The cubic was first partly solved by the 15–16th-century Italian mathematician Scipione del Ferro, who did not however publish his results; this method, though, only solved one type of cubic equation. This solution was then rediscovered independently in 1535 by Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, who shared it with Gerolamo Cardano, asking him to not publish it. Cardano then extended this to numerous other cases, using similar arguments; see more details at Cardano&#x27;s method. After the discovery of del Ferro&#x27;s work, he felt that Tartaglia&#x27;s method was no longer secret, and thus he published his solution in his 1545 &quot;Ars Magna.&quot; His student Lodovico Ferrari solved the quartic polynomial; his solution was also included in &quot;Ars Magna.&quot; In this book, however, Cardano did not provide a &quot;general formula&quot; for the solution of a cubic equation, as he had neither complex numbers at his disposal, nor the algebraic notation to be able to describe a general cubic equation. With the benefit of modern notation and complex numbers, the formulae in this book do work in the general case, but Cardano did not know this. It was Rafael Bombelli who managed to understand how to work with complex numbers in order to solve all forms of cubic equation.

A further step was the 1770 paper &quot;Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations&quot; by the French-Italian mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange, in his method of Lagrange resolvents, where he analyzed Cardano&#x27;s and Ferrari&#x27;s solution of cubics and quartics by considering them in terms of &quot;permutations&quot; of the roots, which yielded an auxiliary polynomial of lower degree, providing a unified understanding of the solutions and laying the groundwork for group theory and Galois&#x27; theory. Crucially, however, he did not consider &quot;composition&quot; of permutations. Lagrange&#x27;s method did not extend to quintic equations or higher, because the resolvent had higher degree.

The quintic was almost proven to have no general solutions by radicals by Paolo Ruffini in 1799, whose key insight was to use permutation &quot;groups&quot;, not just a single permutation. His solution contained a gap, which Cauchy considered minor, though this was not patched until the work of the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, who published a proof in 1824, thus establishing the Abel–Ruffini theorem.

While Ruffini and Abel established that the &quot;general&quot; quintic could not be solved, some &quot;particular&quot; quintics can be solved, such as , and the precise criterion by which a &quot;given&quot; quintic or higher polynomial could be determined to be solvable or not was given by Évariste Galois, who showed that whether a polynomial was solvable or not was equivalent to whether or not the permutation group of its roots – in modern terms, its Galois group – had a certain structure – in modern terms, whether or not it was a solvable group. This group was always solvable for polynomials of degree four or less, but not always so for polynomials of degree five and greater, which explains why there is no general solution in higher degrees. 

=== Galois&#x27; writings ===

In 1830 Galois (at the age of 18) submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences a memoir on his theory of solvability by radicals; Galois&#x27; paper was ultimately rejected in 1831 as being too sketchy and for giving a condition in terms of the roots of the equation instead of its coefficients. Galois then died in a duel in 1832, and his paper, &quot;Mémoire sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations par radicaux&quot;, remained unpublished until 1846 when it was published by Joseph Liouville accompanied by some of his own explanations. Prior to this publication, Liouville announced Galois&#x27; result to the Academy in a speech he gave on 4 July 1843. According to Allan Clark, Galois&#x27;s characterization &quot;dramatically supersedes the work of Abel and Ruffini.&quot;

=== Aftermath ===
Galois&#x27; theory was notoriously difficult for his contemporaries to understand, especially to the level where they could expand on it. For example, in his 1846 commentary, Liouville completely missed the group-theoretic core of Galois&#x27; method. Joseph Alfred Serret who attended some of Liouville&#x27;s talks, included Galois&#x27; theory in his 1866 (third edition) of his textbook &quot;Cours d&#x27;algèbre supérieure&quot;. Serret&#x27;s pupil, Camille Jordan, had an even better understanding reflected in his 1870 book &quot;Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques&quot;. Outside France, Galois&#x27; theory remained more obscure for a longer period. In Britain, Cayley failed to grasp its depth and popular British algebra textbooks did not even mention Galois&#x27; theory until well after the turn of the century. In Germany, Kronecker&#x27;s writings focused more on Abel&#x27;s result. Dedekind wrote little about Galois&#x27; theory, but lectured on it at Göttingen in 1858, showing a very good understanding. Eugen Netto&#x27;s books of the 1880s, based on Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Traité&quot;, made Galois theory accessible to a wider German and American audience as did Heinrich Martin Weber&#x27;s 1895 algebra textbook.

==Permutation group approach==
Given a polynomial, it may be that some of the roots are connected by various algebraic equations. For example, it may be that for two of the roots, say and , that . The central idea of Galois&#x27; theory is to consider permutations (or rearrangements) of the roots such that &quot;any&quot; algebraic equation satisfied by the roots is &quot;still satisfied&quot; after the roots have been permuted. Originally, the theory had been developed for algebraic equations whose coefficients are rational numbers. It extends naturally to equations with coefficients in any field, but this will not be considered in the simple examples below.

These permutations together form a permutation group, also called the Galois group of the polynomial, which is explicitly described in the following examples.

===Quadratic equation===
Consider the quadratic equation

If we exchange and in either of the last two equations we obtain another true statement. For example, the equation becomes . It is more generally true that this holds for &quot;every&quot; possible algebraic relation between and such that all coefficients are rational; that is, in any such relation, swapping and yields another true relation. This results from the theory of symmetric polynomials, which, in this case, may be replaced by formula manipulations involving the binomial theorem.

One might object that and are related by the algebraic equation , which does not remain true when and are exchanged. However, this relation is not considered here, because it has the coefficient which is not rational.

We conclude that the Galois group of the polynomial consists of two permutations: the identity permutation which leaves and untouched, and the transposition permutation which exchanges and . As all groups with two elements are isomorphic, this Galois group is isomorphic to the multiplicative group .

A similar discussion applies to any quadratic polynomial , where , and are rational numbers.
* If the polynomial has rational roots, for example , or , then the Galois group is trivial; that is, it contains only the identity permutation. In this example, if and then is no longer true when and are swapped.
* If it has two irrational roots, for example , then the Galois group contains two permutations, just as in the above example.

===Quartic equation===
Consider the polynomial
:formula_5
Completing the square in an unusual way, it can also be written as
:formula_6
By applying the quadratic formula to each factor, one sees that the four roots are 
:formula_7

Among the 24 possible permutations of these four roots, four are particularly simple, those consisting in the sign change of 0, 1, or 2 square roots. They form a group that is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. 

Galois theory implies that, since the polynomial is irreducible, the Galois group has at least four elements. For proving that the Galois group consists of these four permutations, it suffices thus to show that every element of the Galois group is determined by the image of , which can be shown as follows.

The members of the Galois group must preserve any algebraic equation with rational coefficients involving , , and .

Among these equations, we have:
:formula_8

It follows that, if is a permutation that belongs to the Galois group, we must have:
:formula_9
This implies that the permutation is well defined by the image of , and that the Galois group has 4 elements, which are:
:(identity)
:(change of sign of formula_10)
:(change of sign of formula_11)
:(change of sign of both square roots)
This implies that the Galois group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.

==Modern approach by field theory==
In the modern approach, one starts with a field extension (read &quot; over &quot;), and examines the group of automorphisms of that fix . See the article on Galois groups for further explanation and examples.

The connection between the two approaches is as follows. The coefficients of the polynomial in question should be chosen from the base field . The top field should be the field obtained by adjoining the roots of the polynomial in question to the base field . Any permutation of the roots which respects algebraic equations as described above gives rise to an automorphism of , and vice versa.

In the first example above, we were studying the extension , where is the field of rational numbers, and is the field obtained from by adjoining . In the second example, we were studying the extension .

There are several advantages to the modern approach over the permutation group approach.
* It permits a far simpler statement of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.
* The use of base fields other than is crucial in many areas of mathematics. For example, in algebraic number theory, one often does Galois theory using number fields, finite fields or local fields as the base field.
* It allows one to more easily study infinite extensions. Again this is important in algebraic number theory, where for example one often discusses the absolute Galois group of , defined to be the Galois group of where is an algebraic closure of .
* It allows for consideration of inseparable extensions. This issue does not arise in the classical framework, since it was always implicitly assumed that arithmetic took place in characteristic zero, but nonzero characteristic arises frequently in number theory and in algebraic geometry.
* It removes the rather artificial reliance on chasing roots of polynomials. That is, different polynomials may yield the same extension fields, and the modern approach recognizes the connection between these polynomials.

==Solvable groups and solution by radicals==

The notion of a solvable group in group theory allows one to determine whether a polynomial is solvable in radicals, depending on whether its Galois group has the property of solvability. In essence, each field extension corresponds to a factor group in a composition series of the Galois group. If a factor group in the composition series is cyclic of order , and if in the corresponding field extension the field already contains a primitive th root of unity, then it is a radical extension and the elements of can then be expressed using the th root of some element of .

If all the factor groups in its composition series are cyclic, the Galois group is called &quot;solvable&quot;, and all of the elements of the corresponding field can be found by repeatedly taking roots, products, and sums of elements from the base field (usually ).

One of the great triumphs of Galois Theory was the proof that for every , there exist polynomials of degree which are not solvable by radicals (this was proven independently, using a similar method, by Niels Henrik Abel a few years before, and is the Abel–Ruffini theorem), and a systematic way for testing whether a specific polynomial is solvable by radicals. The Abel–Ruffini theorem results from the fact that for the symmetric group contains a simple, noncyclic, normal subgroup, namely the alternating group .

===A non-solvable quintic example===
Van der Waerden cites the polynomial . 

By the rational root theorem, this has no rational zeroes. 

Neither does it have linear factors modulo 2 or 3.

The Galois group of modulo 2 is cyclic of order 6, because modulo 2 factors into polynomials of orders 2 and 3, .

 modulo 3 has no linear or quadratic factor, and hence is irreducible. Thus its modulo 3 Galois group contains an element of order 5.

It is known that a Galois group modulo a prime is isomorphic to a subgroup of the Galois group over the rationals. A permutation group on 5 objects with elements of orders 6 and 5 must be the symmetric group , which is therefore the Galois group of . 

This is one of the simplest examples of a non-solvable quintic polynomial. According to Serge Lang, Emil Artin was fond of this example.

==Inverse Galois problem==
The &quot;inverse Galois problem&quot; is to find a field extension with a given Galois group.

As long as one does not also specify the ground field, the problem is not very difficult, and all finite groups do occur as Galois groups.
For showing this, one may proceed as follows. Choose a field and a finite group . Cayley&#x27;s theorem says that is (up to isomorphism) a subgroup of the symmetric group on the elements of . Choose indeterminates , one for each element of , and adjoin them to to get the field . Contained within is the field of symmetric rational functions in the . The Galois group of is , by a basic result of Emil Artin. acts on by restriction of action of . If the fixed field of this action is , then, by the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the Galois group of is .

On the other hand, it is an open problem whether every finite group is the Galois group of a field extension of the field of the rational numbers. Igor Shafarevich proved that every solvable finite group is the Galois group of some extension of . Various people have solved the inverse Galois problem for selected non-Abelian simple groups. Existence of solutions has been shown for all but possibly one (Mathieu group ) of the 26 sporadic simple groups. There is even a polynomial with integral coefficients whose Galois group is the Monster group.

==Inseparable extensions==
In the form mentioned above, including in particular the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the theory only considers Galois extensions, which are in particular separable. General field extensions can be split into a separable, followed by a purely inseparable field extension. For a purely inseparable extension &quot;F&quot; / &quot;K&quot;, there is a Galois theory where the Galois group is replaced by the vector space of derivations, formula_12, i.e., &quot;K&quot;-linear endomorphisms of &quot;F&quot; satisfying the Leibniz rule. In this correspondence, an intermediate field &quot;E&quot; is assigned formula_13. Conversely, a subspace formula_14 satisfying appropriate further conditions is mapped to formula_15. Under the assumption formula_16, showed that this establishes a one-to-one correspondence. The condition imposed by Jacobson has been removed by , by giving a correspondence using notions of derived algebraic geometry.

<text>Shannara is a series of high fantasy novels written by Terry Brooks, beginning with &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; in 1977 and concluding with &quot;The Last Druid&quot; which was released in October 2020; there is also a prequel, &quot;First King of Shannara&quot;. The series blends magic and primitive technology and is set in the Four Lands, which are identified as Earth long after civilization was destroyed in a chemical and nuclear holocaust called the Great Wars. By the time of the prequel &quot;First King of Shannara&quot;, the world had reverted to a pre-industrial state and magic had re-emerged to supplement science.

==Setting==
The Shannara series is set in a post-apocalyptic world called the Four Lands. This world is a futuristic version of our own, and not a secondary world. The &quot;Genesis of Shannara&quot; trilogy reveals the Four Lands to be located in the modern Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. Much of the landscape has been changed by a future nuclear holocaust called The Great Wars, but some landmarks remain. For example, the Columbia River still exists.

Each land is named after the compass point it faces: the Northland, the Southland, the Eastland, and the Westland, and is the primary home of different peoples. The Westland is the homeland primarily of the elves, while the Northland is mostly inhabited by trolls and the Eastland is the home mostly of dwarves and gnomes. The Southland is primarily the homeland of humans.

== Characters ==
*Allanon, described as Brooks&#x27; &quot;most enigmatic character&quot;, is very secretive and the last remaining Druid of the original order. Trained by Bremen, he lived an unexpectedly long life, being the Druid that summons the Ohmsford family during the original trilogy (Sword, Elfstones, and Wishsong). He is never completely honest, telling many white lies or half-truths, and provides others with information only if it is dangerous, crucial, or required. Allanon often called on the aid of the Ohmsford family in the novels, as they are descendants of Jerle Shannara and therefore the only ones who can use the Sword of Shannara. He called upon Shea Ohmsford in &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;, Wil Ohmsford in &quot;The Elfstones of Shannara&quot; and Brin and Jair Ohmsford in &quot;The Wishsong of Shannara&quot;.
*Galaphile was the Elf who was responsible in the creation of the Druids. Meeting at Paranor, it was he that believed that the Druids shouldn&#x27;t belong to any one race, so they became separated from the people.
*The Druids are an order of historians, philosophers, magic-users, teachers and researchers. The greatest minds that remained in the Four Lands were first assembled by Galaphile at the fortress of Paranor. Druid Magic, like most of the magic that originates in the Four Lands, is elemental. It draws from the earth, air, fire and water in various forms. Its power is enhanced or weakened by the strength of the user. Some users would find more success with talismans like the Sword or the Elfstones than others. Sometimes the magic of a talisman or an external source links with the magic innate in a user, causing various results. Unlike science, magic is uncertain, and the results of its application are not always predictable.
*The Warlock Lord was formerly a Druid named Brona who was removed from the walls of Paranor for studying and practicing forbidden magic found in an ancient sentient tome called the Ildatch. He and his followers then inhabited the Skull Kingdom deep in the Northland.
*King of the Silver River - a Faerie creature who appears throughout the series. 
*Skull Bearers were Druids once upon a time, but they were subverted by the Ildatch along with the druid Brona, who would later become the Warlock Lord. They &quot;sacrificed their humanity&quot; to become &quot;winged black destroyers&quot;; but in doing this, they tied themselves to their master, the Warlock Lord, and became his &quot;dread minion[s]&quot;. Reviewers and critics had mixed opinions on the Skull Bearers. Praise for them came from Frank Herbert, the author of &quot;Dune&quot;, who liked all of the &quot;monsters&quot; in &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;. He said that &quot;[Terry] Brooks creates distillations of horror that hark back to childhood&#x27;s shadows, when the most important thing about a fearful creature was that you didn&#x27;t know its exact shape and intent. You only knew that it wanted &quot;you&quot;. The black-winged skull bearer, for instance, is more than a euphemism for death.&quot; Tom Shippey wasn&#x27;t so positive, as he thought that the Skull Bearers were very familiar to those who had read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: he found that the Skull Bearers were &quot;analogues&quot; for the Nazgûl.
*Demons is a common name for many different creatures in novels by Terry Brooks. They are creatures that were trapped inside the Forbidding after the creation of the Ellcrys. 
*The Dagda Mor is the antagonist of &quot;The Elfstones of Shannara&quot;. He is the most powerful Demon locked inside the Forbidding. As such, most of the others obey him out of fear, with a few notable exceptions, such as the Reaper. He channels his magic through his Staff of Power.
*Shea Ohmsford is the protagonist of the &quot;Sword of Shannara&quot;. He has the blood of Jerle Shannara, making him the only one who can wield the powerful Sword of Shannara to vanquish the Warlock Lord. A major theme of &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; revolves around Shea. Part of his quest, in addition to killing the Warlock Lord, includes finding a belief in himself, so that he will have confidence to go on. This is a search that every subsequent Brooks protagonist must undergo. Scholar Tom Shippey believed that Shea was too familiar to those who had read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: he found that Shea and Flick were &quot;analogues&quot; for the hobbits of Tolkien&#x27;s stories. Terry Brooks stated in his autobiography that &quot;[his] protagonists [Shea and Flick] are cut from the same bolt of cloth as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins.&quot;
*Garet Jax is known as the &quot;Weapons Master&quot; Garet first appears when he rescues Jair Ohmsford from a band of nine Gnome Hunters, defeating eight of them single-handedly—he killed six, knocked out their leader, and one fled. The ninth, Slanter, doesn&#x27;t even attempt to fight, saying that he was only working with them because he had to, and he has heard stories about the fighting prowess of Garet. Terry Brooks expressed his desire in the beginning of &quot;Dark Wraith&quot; to further explore the relationship between Jair and Garet Jax.
*Cogline is the &quot;grandfather&quot; of Kimber Boh. Cogline found Kimber after Gnomes killed Kimber&#x27;s parents when she was an infant. It is later found out that Cogline was a former failed Druid, with knowledge of alchemical arts. Was referred to as Walker Boh&#x27;s guardian and teacher before Walker Boh became a Druid. Cogline aids Brin in her leg of the journey to find and destroy the Ildatch, the ancient Book of Power that holds the forbidden knowledge of the Druids. It is referred to as the book that led the Druid Brona to becoming the Warlock Lord.
*Wil Ohmsford is the grandson of Shea Ohmsford. One who would forsake his birthright he sought to become a healer, studying amongst the Stors at Storlock. He unwillingly became the protector of the Chosen Amberle, after being sought out by Allanon, on the quest to restore the Ellcrys and reseal the crumbling wall of the Forbidding. 
*Eventine Elessedil is possibly the greatest Elven King, maybe with the exception of Jerle Shannara. He is the backbone that the Elves need to withstand the attacks of the Warlock Lord in The Sword of Shannara and the Demon hordes in The Elfstones of Shannara.

==Important places==
* Arborlon is the capital city of the Elves. It is unusual, in that it is not bound to a particular location, but basically moves with the Elves by being transferred into a magic Gemstone, called the Loden: In the &quot;Genesis of Shannara&quot; trilogy, it is located in the Cintra. In most novels, it is located in the Westland, except for the &quot;Heritage of Shannara&quot; tetralogy, where it is located on an island, named Morrowindl, before being brought back by Wren Ohmsford.
* Paranor is the fortress home of the druids. Technically located in the Northland, it remains close to each of the Four Lands so that the Druids would not show favoritism towards one people.
* Shady Vale is the ancestral home of the Ohmsfords.
* Tyrsis is one of the largest human cities. It is in the borderlands known as Callahorn, between the Northland and the Southland and serves as the first line of defense against the Northland armies.
* Storlock is home to the healers known as the Stors. Located in the Eastland, it is much like Paranor as it does not show favoritism towards one people.
* Leah is a small highland kingdom located southwest of Rainbow Lake. The ruling family, the Leah&#x27;s, join in on many of the Ohmsford adventures.

== Television and film rights ==
In 2007, Warner Bros. optioned the film rights to the Shannara universe for producer Dan Farah, but the rights deal expired in 2010 and all rights reverted to Terry Brooks.

Farah Films partnered with Sonar Entertainment to acquire TV rights to the Shannara universe in 2012. In December, 2013 it was announced an epic TV series based on the books was being produced for MTV. The series is produced by Dan Farah, Jon Favreau, and &quot;Smallville&quot; showrunners Miles Millar and Al Gough, and Jonathan Liebesman. During the Shannara Chronicles panel at San Diego Comic Con in July 2015, a teaser trailer was revealed, giving audiences a first look at the sets and characters. A television version of the trailer was shown during the 2015 MTV Music Awards. The series premiered January 5, 2016. Season 2 began airing on Spike in October 2017.

On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons. Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks. The series was later considered officially concluded.

<text>Alcibiades ( ; ; 450–404 BC) was an Athenian statesman and general. The last of the Alcmaeonidae, he played a major role in the second half of the Peloponnesian War as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician, but subsequently fell from prominence.

During the course of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed his political allegiance several times. In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated an aggressive foreign policy and was a prominent proponent of the Sicilian Expedition. After his political enemies brought charges of sacrilege against him, he fled to Sparta, where he served as a strategic adviser, proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens. However, Alcibiades made powerful enemies in Sparta too, and defected to Persia. There he served as an adviser to the satrap Tissaphernes until Athenian political allies brought about his recall. He served as an Athenian general (strategos) for several years, but enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.

Scholars have argued that had the Sicilian expedition been under Alcibiades&#x27;s command instead of that of Nicias, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous fate. In the years when he served Sparta, Alcibiades played a significant role in Athens&#x27;s undoing; the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege.

Alcibiades&#x27;s military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state currently held his allegiance, but his propensity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long; and, by the end of the war that he had helped to rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were a bygone memory. He is remembered in art and literature as a student of Socrates.

==Early years==

Alcibiades was born in Athens. The family of his father, Cleinias, had old connections with the Spartan aristocracy through a relationship of &quot;xenia&quot;, and the name &quot;Alcibiades&quot; was of Spartan origin. Alcibiades&#x27; mother was Deinomache, the daughter of Megacles, head of the powerful Alcmaeonid family, and could trace her family back to Eurysaces and the Telamonian Ajax. Alcibiades thereby, through his mother, belonged to the powerful and controversial family of the Alcmaeonidae; the renowned Pericles and his brother Ariphron were Deinomache&#x27;s cousins, as her father and their mother were siblings. His paternal grandfather, also named Alcibiades, was a friend of Cleisthenes, the famous constitutional reformer of the late sixth century BC. After the death of Cleinias at the Battle of Coronea (447 BC), Pericles and Ariphron became his guardians.

According to Plutarch, Alcibiades had several famous teachers, including Socrates, and was well trained in the art of rhetoric. He was noted, however, for his unruly behavior, which was mentioned by ancient Greek and Latin writers on several occasions. It was believed that Socrates took Alcibiades as a student because he believed he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. Xenophon attempted to clear Socrates&#x27;s name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed in attempting to teach him morality.
Alcibiades took part in the Battle of Potidaea in 432 BC, where Socrates was said to have saved his life. Alcibiades later returned the favour by rescuing Socrates at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC. Alcibiades had a particularly close relationship with Socrates, whom he admired and respected. Plutarch and Plato describe Alcibiades as Socrates&#x27;s beloved, the former stating that Alcibiades &quot;feared and reverenced Socrates alone, and despised the rest of his lovers&quot;.
Alcibiades was married to Hipparete, the daughter of Hipponicus, a wealthy Athenian. His bride brought with her a large dowry, which significantly increased Alcibiades&#x27; already substantial family fortune. According to Plutarch, Hipparete loved her husband but attempted to divorce him because he consorted with courtesans, but he prevented her from appearing at court. He seized her in court and carried her home again through the crowded Agora. She lived with him until her death, which came soon after, and gave birth to two children, a son named Alcibiades the Younger and a daughter. Alcibiades was famed throughout his life for his physical attractiveness, of which he was inordinately vain.

==Political career until 412 BC==
===Rise to prominence===
Alcibiades first rose to prominence when he began advocating aggressive Athenian action after the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which neither side had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey believe, and Thucydides reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and Laches, overlooking him on account of his youth.

Disputes over the interpretation of the treaty led the Spartans to dispatch ambassadors to Athens with full powers to arrange all unsettled matters. The Athenians initially received these ambassadors well, but Alcibiades met with them in secret before they were to speak to the ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) and told them that the Assembly was haughty and had great ambitions. He urged them to renounce their diplomatic authority to represent Sparta, and instead allow him to assist them through his influence in Athenian politics. The representatives agreed and, impressed with Alcibiades, they alienated themselves from Nicias, who genuinely wanted to reach an agreement with the Spartans. The next day, during the Assembly, Alcibiades asked them what powers Sparta had granted them to negotiate and they replied, as agreed, that they had not come with full and independent powers. This was in direct contradiction to what they had said the day before, and Alcibiades seized on this opportunity to denounce their character, cast suspicion on their aims, and destroy their credibility. This ploy increased Alcibiades&#x27;s standing while embarrassing Nicias, and Alcibiades was subsequently appointed general. He took advantage of his increasing power to orchestrate the creation of an alliance between Argos, Mantinea, Elis, and other states in the Peloponnese, threatening Sparta&#x27;s dominance in the region. According to Gomme, &quot;it was a grandiose scheme for an Athenian general at the head of a mainly Peloponnesian army to march through the Peloponnese cocking a snook at Sparta when her reputation was at its lowest&quot;. This alliance, however, would ultimately be defeated at the Battle of Mantinea.

Somewhere in the years 416–415 BC, a complex struggle took place between Hyperbolos on one side and Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders.

Alcibiades was not one of the generals involved in the capture of Melos in 416–415 BC, but Plutarch describes him as a supporter of the decree by which the grown men of Melos were killed and the women and children enslaved. An oration urging Alcibiades&#x27; ostracism, &quot;Against Alcibiades&quot; (historically attributed to the orator Andocides but not in fact by him), alleges that Alcibiades had a child by one of these enslaved women.

===Sicilian Expedition===

In 415 BC, delegates from the Sicilian city of Segesta () arrived at Athens to plead for the support of the Athenians in their war against Selinus. During the debates on the undertaking, Nicias was vehemently opposed to Athenian intervention, explaining that the campaign would be very costly and attacking the character and motives of Alcibiades, who had emerged as a major supporter of the expedition. On the other hand, Alcibiades argued that a campaign in this new theatre would bring riches to the city and expand the empire, just as the Persian Wars had. In his speech Alcibiades predicted (over-optimistically, in the opinion of most historians) that the Athenians would be able to recruit allies in the region and impose their rule on Syracuse, the most powerful city of Sicily. In spite of Alcibiades&#x27;s enthusiastic advocacy for the plan, it was Nicias, not he, who turned a modest undertaking into a massive campaign and made the conquest of Sicily seem possible and safe. It was at his suggestion that the size of the fleet was significantly increased from 60 ships to &quot;140 galleys, 5,100 men at arms, and about 1300 archers, slingers, and light armed men&quot;. Philosopher Leo Strauss underscores that the Sicilian expedition surpassed everything undertaken by Pericles. Almost certainly Nicias&#x27;s intention was to shock the assembly with his high estimate of the forces required, but, instead of dissuading his fellow citizens, his analysis made them all the more eager. Against his wishes Nicias was appointed general along with Alcibiades and Lamachus, all three of whom were given full powers to do whatever was in the best interests of Athens while in Sicily.

One night during preparations for the expedition, the hermai, heads of the god Hermes on a plinth with a phallus, were mutilated throughout Athens. This was a religious scandal, resulted in a charge of &quot;asebeia&quot; (impiety) against Alcibiades, and was seen as a bad omen for the mission. Plutarch explains that Androcles, a political leader, used false witnesses who accused Alcibiades and his friends of mutilating the statues, and of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries. Later his opponents, chief among them being Androcles and Thessalus, Cimon&#x27;s son, enlisted orators to argue that Alcibiades should set sail as planned and stand trial on his return from the campaign. Alcibiades was suspicious of their intentions, and asked to be allowed to stand trial immediately, under penalty of death, in order to clear his name. This request was denied, and the fleet set sail soon after, with the charges unresolved.

As Alcibiades had suspected, his absence emboldened his enemies, and they began to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions and comments and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were always in fear and took everything suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in Catania, it found the state trireme &quot;Salaminia&quot; waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back to Athens in his ship, but in Thurii he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them. Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to the friends of the Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, admired by Thucydides (however a modern scholar has judged him to be an inadequate military leader).

===Defection to Sparta===
After his disappearance at Thurii, Alcibiades quickly contacted the Spartans, &quot;promising to render them aid and service greater than all the harm he had previously done them as an enemy&quot; if they would offer him sanctuary. The Spartans granted this request and received him among them. Because of this defection, the Athenians condemned him to death &quot;in absentia&quot; and confiscated his property. In the debate at Sparta over whether to send a force to relieve Syracuse, Alcibiades spoke and instilled fear of Athenian ambition into the Spartan ephors by informing them that the Athenians hoped to conquer Sicily, Italy, and even Carthage. Yale historian Donald Kagan believes that Alcibiades knowingly exaggerated the plans of the Athenians to convince the Spartans of the benefit they stood to gain from his help. Kagan asserts that Alcibiades had not yet acquired his &quot;legendary&quot; reputation, and the Spartans saw him as &quot;a defeated and hunted man&quot; whose policies &quot;produced strategic failures&quot; and brought &quot;no decisive result&quot;. If accurate, this assessment underscores one of Alcibiades&#x27;s greatest talents, his highly persuasive oratory. After making the threat seem imminent, Alcibiades advised the Spartans to send troops and most importantly, a Spartan commander to discipline and aid the Syracusans.

Alcibiades served as a military adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised them to build a permanent fort at Decelea, just over from Athens and within sight of the city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely from their homes and crops and the silver mines of Sunium. This was part of Alcibiades&#x27;s plan to renew the war with Athens in Attica. The move was devastating to Athens and forced the citizens to live within the long walls of the city year round, making them entirely dependent on their seaborne trade for food. Seeing Athens thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the Delian League began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens&#x27;s disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to Ionia with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.

In spite of these valuable contributions to the Spartan cause, around this time Alcibiades fell out of favor with the government of king Agis II. Leotychides, the son born by Agis&#x27;s wife Timaea, Queen of Sparta (or Queen Timonassa), shortly after this, was believed by many to be Alcibiades&#x27;s son. An alternate account asserts that Alcibiades took advantage of King Agis&#x27; absence with the Spartan army in Attica and seduced his wife.

Alcibiades&#x27;s influence was further reduced after the retirement of Endius, the ephor who was on good terms with him. It is alleged that Astyochus, a Spartan admiral, was sent orders to kill him, but Alcibiades received warning of this order and defected to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes, who had been supporting the Peloponnesian forces financially in 412 BC.

===Defection to Achaemenid Empire in Asia Minor===
On his arrival in the local Persian court, Alcibiades won the trust of the powerful satrap and made several policy suggestions which were well received. According to Thucydides, Alcibiades immediately began to do all he could with Tissaphernes to injure the Peloponnesian cause. At his urging, the satrap reduced the payments he was making to the Peloponnesian fleet and began delivering them irregularly. Alcibiades next advised Tissaphernes to bribe the generals of the cities to gain valuable intelligence on their activities. Lastly, and most importantly, he told the satrap to be in no hurry to bring the Persian fleet into the conflict, as the longer the war dragged out the more exhausted the combatants would become. This would allow the Persians to more easily conquer the region in the aftermath of the fighting. Alcibiades tried to convince the satrap that it was in Persia&#x27;s interest to wear both Athens and Sparta out at first, &quot;and after docking the Athenian power as much as he could, forthwith to rid the country of the Peloponnesians&quot;.

Although Alcibiades&#x27;s advice benefited the Persians, it was merely a means to an end; Thucydides tells us that his real motive was to use his alleged influence with the Persians to effect his restoration to Athens. Alcibiades was one of several Greek aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire following reversals at home, other famous ones being Themistocles, Demaratos or Gongylos. According to Thucydides (Thuc.8.47), Alcibiades also advised the Achaemenid king (Darius II), and therefore he may have traveled to Susa or Babylonia to encounter him.

==Recall to Athens==
===Negotiations with the Athenian oligarchs===
Alcibiades seemed to assume that the &quot;radical democracy&quot; would never agree to his recall to Athens. He exchanged messages with the Athenian leaders at Samos and suggested that if they could install an oligarchy friendly to him he would return to Athens and bring with him Persian money and possibly the Persian fleet of 147 triremes. Alcibiades set about winning over the most influential military officers, and achieved his goal by offering them a threefold plan: the Athenian constitution was to be changed, the recall of Alcibiades was to be voted, and Alcibiades was to win over Tissaphernes and the King of Persia to the Athenian side. Most of the officers in the Athenian fleet accepted the plan and welcomed the prospect of a narrower constitution, which would allow them a greater part in determining policy. According to Thucydides, only one of the Athenian generals at Samos, Phrynichus, opposed the plan and argued that Alcibiades cared no more for the proposed oligarchy than for the traditional democracy. The involvement in the plot of another general, Thrasybulus, remains unclear.

These officers of the Athenian fleet formed a group of conspirators, but were met with opposition from the majority of the soldiers and sailors; these were eventually calmed down &quot;by the advantageous prospect of the pay from the king&quot;. The members of the group assembled and prepared to send Pisander, one of their number, on an embassy to Athens to treat for the restoration of Alcibiades and the abolition of democracy in the city, and thus to make Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians.

Phrynichus, fearing that Alcibiades if restored would avenge himself upon him for his opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, to tell him that Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation of the rest of the intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at Magnesia and communicated to them Phrynichus&#x27;s letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades&#x27;s letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.

Despite these events, Pisander and the other envoys of the conspirators arrived at Athens and made a speech before the people. Pisander won the argument, putting Alcibiades and his promises at the center. The Ecclesia deposed Phrynichus and elected Pisander and ten other envoys to negotiate with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades.

At this point, Alcibiades&#x27;s scheme encountered a great obstacle. Tissaphernes would not make an agreement on any terms, wanting to follow his policy of neutrality. As Kagan points out, Tissaphernes was a prudent leader and had recognized the advantages of wearing each side out without direct Persian involvement. Alcibiades realized this and, by presenting the Athenians with stiffer and stiffer demands on Tissaphernes&#x27;s behalf, attempted to convince them that he had persuaded Tissaphernes to support them, but that they had not conceded enough to him. Although the envoys were angered at the audacity of the Persian demands, they nevertheless departed with the impression that Alcibiades could have brought about an agreement among the powers if he had chosen to do so. This at the court of Tissaphernes, however, put an end to the negotiations between the conspirators and Alcibiades. The group was convinced that Alcibiades could not deliver his side of the bargain without demanding exorbitantly high concessions of them and they accordingly abandoned their plans to restore him to Athens.

===Reinstatement as an Athenian general===

In spite of the failure of the negotiations, the conspirators succeeded in overthrowing the democracy and imposing the oligarchic government of the Four Hundred, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the trierarch Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating that they had not revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.

After a time, Thrasybulus persuaded the assembled troops to vote Alcibiades&#x27;s recall, a policy that he had supported since before the coup. Then he sailed to retrieve Alcibiades and returned with him to Samos. The aim of this policy was to win away Persian support from the Spartans, as it was still believed that Alcibiades had great influence with Tissaphernes. Plutarch claims that the army sent for Alcibiades so as to use his help in putting down the tyrants in Athens. Kagan argues that this reinstatement was a disappointment to Alcibiades, who had hoped for a glorious return to Athens itself but found himself only restored to the rebellious fleet, where the immunity from prosecution he had been granted &quot;protected him for the time being but not from a reckoning in the future&quot;; furthermore, the recall, which Alcibiades had hoped to bring about through his own prestige and perceived influence, was achieved through the patronage of Thrasybulus.

In his first speech to the assembled troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about the circumstances of his exile, but most of the speech was boasting of his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens fear him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him general alongside Thrasybulus and the others. He roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and would have led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades&#x27;s reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.

Presently Alcibiades sailed to Tissaphernes with a detachment of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed purpose of this mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming to the aid of the Peloponnesians. Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at Aspendus and that Alcibiades told the troops he would bring the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming at all, but Thucydides further speculates that the real reason was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try to gain some real influence over him. According to the historian, Alcibiades had long known that Tissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all.

===Battles of Abydos and Cyzicus===

Alcibiades was recalled by the &quot;intermediate regime&quot; of The Five Thousand, the government which succeeded the Four Hundred in 411, but it is most likely that he waited until 407 BC to actually return to the city. Plutarch tells us that, although his recall had already been passed on motion of Critias, a political ally of his, Alcibiades was resolved to come back with glory. While this was certainly his goal, it was again a means to an end, that end being to avoid prosecution upon his return to Athens.

The next significant part he would play in the war would occur at the Battle of Abydos. Alcibiades had remained behind at Samos with a small force while Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus led the greater part of the fleet to the Hellespont. During this period, Alcibiades succeeded in raising money from Caria and the neighboring area, with which he was able to pay the rowers and gain their favor. After the Athenian victory at Cynossema, both fleets summoned all their ships from around the Aegean to join them for what might be a decisive next engagement. While Alcibiades was still en route, the Athenians fought off the arrival of the Rhodian admiral Dorieus who appeared with 14 ships and was forced into Rhoeteium. The Spartans sailed to assist him and the two fleets clashed at Abydos, where the Peloponnesians had set up their main naval base. The battle was evenly matched, and raged for a long time, but the balance tipped towards the Athenians when Alcibiades sailed into the Hellespont with eighteen triremes. The Persian satrap Pharnabazus, who had replaced Tissaphernes as the sponsor of the Peloponnesian fleet, moved his land army to the shore to defend the ships and sailors who had beached their ships. Only the support of the Persian land army and the coming of night saved the Peloponnesian fleet from complete destruction.

Shortly after the battle, Tissaphernes had arrived in the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, bringing gifts and hoping once again to try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape with another Athenian, Mantitheos, and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.

After an interlude of several months in which the Peloponnesians constructed new ships and the Athenians besieged cities and raised money throughout the Aegean, the next major sea battle took place the spring of 410 BC at Cyzicus. Alcibiades had been forced to flee from Sestos to Cardia to protect his small fleet from the rebuilt Peloponnesian navy, but as soon as the Athenian fleet was reunited there its commanders led it to Cyzicus, where the Athenians had intelligence indicating that Pharnabazus and Mindarus, the Peloponnesian fleet commander, were together plotting their next move. Concealed by storm and darkness, the combined Athenian force reached the vicinity without being spotted by the Peloponnesians. Here the Athenians devised a plot to draw the enemy into battle. According to Diodorus Siculus, Alcibiades advanced with a small squadron in order to draw the Spartans out to battle, and, after he successfully deceived Mindarus with this ploy, the squadrons of Thrasybulus and Theramenes came to join him, cutting off the Spartans&#x27; retreat.

The Spartan fleet suffered losses in the flight and reached the shore with the Athenians in close pursuit. Alcibiades&#x27; troops, leading the Athenian pursuit, landed and attempted to pull the Spartan ships back out to sea. The Peloponnesians fought to prevent their ships from being towed away, and Pharnabazus&#x27;s troops came up to support them. Thrasybulus landed his own force to temporarily relieve pressure on Alcibiades, and meanwhile ordered Theramenes to join up with Athenian land forces nearby and bring them to reinforce the sailors and marines on the beach. The Spartans and Persians, overwhelmed by the arrival of multiple forces from several directions, were defeated and driven off, and the Athenians captured all the Spartan ships which were not destroyed. A letter dispatched to Sparta by Hippocrates, vice-admiral under Mindarus, was intercepted and taken to Athens; it ran as follows: &quot;The ships are lost. Mindarus is dead. The men are starving. We know not what to do&quot;. A short time later Sparta petitioned for peace, but their appeals were ultimately rejected by the Athenians.

===Further military successes===
After their victory, Alcibiades and Thrasybulus began the siege of Chalcedon in 409 BC with about 190 ships. Although unable to attain a decisive victory or induce the city to surrender, Alcibiades was able to win a small tactical land battle outside of the city gates and Theramenes concluded an agreement with the Chalcedonians. Afterwards they concluded a temporary alliance with Pharnabazus which secured some much needed immediate cash for the army, but despite this Alcibiades was still forced to depart in search for more booty to pay the soldiers and oarsmen of the fleet.

In pursuit of these funds he traveled to the Thracian Chersonese and attacked Selymbria. He plotted with a pro-Athenian party within the city and offered the Selymbrians reasonable terms, imposing strict discipline on his men to see that they were observed. He did the Selymbrians&#x27;s city no injury whatsoever, but merely took a sum of money from it, set a garrison there and left. Epigraphical evidence indicates the Selymbrians surrendered hostages until the treaty was ratified in Athens. His performance is judged as skillful by historians, since it saved time, resources, and lives and still fully achieved his goal.

From here Alcibiades joined in the siege of Byzantium along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A portion of the citizens of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement in the midst of the fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.

==Return to Athens, dismissal, and death==
===Return to Athens===
It was in the aftermath of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even in the wake of his recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, rather than going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens regarding his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.

Therefore, he finally sailed into Piraeus where the crowd had gathered, desiring to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear until he saw his cousin and others of his friends and acquaintances, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero&#x27;s welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen in the fact that he had returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.

All the criminal proceedings against him were canceled and the charges of blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for the celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries) by land for the first time since the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a sea voyage, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).

===Defeat at Notium===
In 406 BC Alcibiades set out from Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take Andros and then he went on to Samos. Later he moved to Notium, closer to the enemy at Ephesus. Meanwhile, Tissaphernes had been replaced by Cyrus the Younger (son of Darius II of Persia) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This new revenue started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with Lysander, a very capable admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet at the expense of the Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to watch them under the command of his personal helmsman Antiochus, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed this single order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was radically different from that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been well informed about their fleet by deserters. Antiochus&#x27;s ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.

Responsibility for the defeat ultimately fell on Alcibiades, and his enemies used the opportunity to attack him and have him removed from command, although some modern scholars believe that Alcibiades was unfairly blamed for Antiochus&#x27;s mistake. Diodorus reports that, in addition to his mistake at Notium, Alcibiades was discharged on account of false accusations brought against him by his enemies. According to historian Antony Andrewes, the extravagant hopes that his successes of the previous summer had created were a decisive element in his downfall. Consequently, Alcibiades condemned himself to exile. Never again returning to Athens, he sailed north to the castles in the Thracian Chersonese, which he had secured during his time in the Hellespont. The implications of the defeat were severe for Athens. Although the defeat had been minor, it occasioned the removal of not only Alcibiades but also his allies such as Thrasybulus, Theramenes, and Critias. These were likely the most capable commanders Athens had at the time, and their removal would help lead to the Athenian surrender only two years later, after their complete defeat at Aegospotami.

===Death===
With one exception, Alcibiades&#x27;s role in the war ended with his command. Prior to the Battle of Aegospotami, in the last attested fact of his career, Alcibiades recognized that the Athenians were anchored in a tactically disadvantageous spot and advised them to move to Sestus where they could benefit from a harbor and a city. Diodorus, however, does not mention this advice, arguing instead that Alcibiades offered the generals Thracian aid in exchange for a share in the command. In any case, the generals of the Athenians, &quot;considering that in case of defeat the blame would attach to them and that in case of success all men would attribute it to Alcibiades&quot;, asked him to leave and not come near the camp ever again. Days later the fleet would be annihilated by Lysander.
After the Battle of Aegospotami, Alcibiades crossed the Hellespont and took refuge in Hellespontine Phrygia, with the object of securing the aid of the Achaemenid King Artaxerxes against Sparta. Alcibiades was one of several Greek aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire following reversals at home, other famous ones being Themistocles, Hippias, Demaratos and Gongylos. For the most part, they were generously welcomed by the Achaemenid kings, and received land grants to support them, and ruled in various cities of Asia Minor.

Much about the circumstances of Alcibiades&#x27;s death is uncertain, as there are conflicting accounts. According to the oldest of these, the Spartans and specifically Lysander were responsible. Though many of his details cannot be independently corroborated, Plutarch&#x27;s version is that Lysander sent an envoy to Pharnabazus who then dispatched his brother to Phrygia where Alcibiades was living with his mistress, Timandra.

In 404 BC, as he was about to set out for the Persian court, his residence was surrounded and set on fire. Seeing no chance of escape he rushed out on his assassins, dagger in hand, and was killed by a shower of arrows. According to Aristotle, the site of Alcibiades&#x27;s death was Elaphus, a mountain in Phrygia.

==Assessments==

===Political career===
In ancient Greece, Alcibiades was a polarizing figure. According to Thucydides, Alcibiades, being &quot;exceedingly ambitious&quot;, proposed the expedition in Sicily in order &quot;to gain in wealth and reputation by means of his successes&quot;. Alcibiades is not held responsible by Thucydides for the destruction of Athens, since &quot;his habits gave offence to every one, and caused the Athenians to commit affairs to other hands, and thus before long to ruin the city&quot;. Plutarch regards him as &quot;the least scrupulous and most entirely careless of human beings&quot;. On the other hand, Diodorus argues that he was &quot;in spirit brilliant and intent upon great enterprises&quot;. Sharon Press of Brown University points out that Xenophon emphasizes Alcibiades&#x27;s service to the state, rather than the harm he was charged with causing it. Demosthenes defends Alcibiades&#x27;s achievements, saying that he had taken arms in the cause of democracy, displaying his patriotism, not by gifts of money or by speeches, but by personal service. For Demosthenes and other orators, Alcibiades epitomized the figure of the great man during the glorious days of the Athenian democracy and became a rhetorical symbol. One of Isocrates&#x27; speeches, delivered by Alcibiades the Younger, argues that the statesman deserved the Athenians&#x27; gratitude for the service he had given them. Lysias, on the other hand, argued in one of his orations that the Athenians should regard Alcibiades as an enemy because of the general tenor of his life, as &quot;he repays with injury the open assistance of any of his friends&quot;. In the &quot;Constitution of the Athenians&quot;, Aristotle does not include Alcibiades in the list of the best Athenian politicians, but in &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; he argues that traits of a proud man like Alcibiades are &quot;equanimity amid the vicissitudes of life and impatience of dishonor&quot;. Alcibiades excited in his contemporaries a fear for the safety of the political order. Therefore, Andocides said of him that &quot;instead of holding that he ought himself to conform with the laws of the state, he expects you to conform with his own way of life&quot;. Central to the depiction of the Athenian statesman is Cornelius Nepos&#x27; famous phrase that Alcibiades &quot;surpassed all the Athenians in grandeur and magnificence of living&quot;.

Even today, Alcibiades divides scholars. For Malcolm F. McGregor, former head of the Department of Classics in the University of British Columbia, Alcibiades was rather a shrewd gambler than a mere opportunist. Evangelos P. Fotiadis, a prominent Greek philologist, asserts that Alcibiades was &quot;a first class diplomat&quot; and had &quot;huge skills&quot;. Nevertheless, his spiritual powers were not counterbalanced with his magnificent mind and he had the hard luck to lead a people susceptible to demagoguery. K. Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, underlines his &quot;spiritual virtues&quot; and compares him with Themistocles, but he then asserts that all these gifts created a &quot;traitor, an audacious and impious man&quot;. Walter Ellis believes that his actions were outrageous, but they were performed with panache. For his part, David Gribble argues that Alcibiades&#x27;s actions against his city were misunderstood and believes that &quot;the tension which led to Alcibiades&#x27;s split with the city was between purely personal and civic values&quot;. Russell Meiggs, a British ancient historian, asserts that the Athenian statesman was absolutely unscrupulous despite his great charm and brilliant abilities. According to Meiggs his actions were dictated by selfish motives and his feud with Cleon and his successors undermined Athens. The same scholar underscores the fact that &quot;his example of restless and undisciplined ambition strengthened the charge brought against Socrates&quot;. Even more critically, Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and international politics, state that Alcibiades&#x27;s own arguments &quot;should be sufficient to do away with the notion that Alcibiades was a great statesman, as some people still believe&quot;. Writing from a different perspective, psychologist Anna C. Salter cites Alcibiades as exhibiting &quot;all the classic features of psychopathy.&quot; A similar assessment is made by Hervey Cleckley at the end of chapter 5 in his &quot;The Mask of Sanity&quot;.

===Military achievements===
Despite his critical comments, Thucydides admits in a short digression that &quot;publicly his conduct of the war was as good as could be desired&quot;. Diodorus and Demosthenes regard him as a great general. According to Fotiadis, Alcibiades was an invincible general and, wherever he went, victory followed him; had he led the army in Sicily, the Athenians would have avoided disaster and, had his countrymen followed his advice at Aegospotami, Lysander would have lost and Athens would have ruled Greece. On the other hand, Paparrigopoulos believes that the Sicilian Expedition, prompted by Alcibiades, was a strategic mistake. In agreement with Paparrigopoulos, Platias and Koliopoulos underscore the fact that the Sicilian expedition was a strategic blunder of the first magnitude, resulting from a &quot;frivolous attitude and an unbelievable underestimation of the enemy&quot;. For his part, Angelos Vlachos, a Greek Academician, underlines the constant interest of Athens for Sicily from the beginning of the war. According to Vlachos, the expedition had nothing of the extravagant or adventurous and constituted a rational strategic decision based on traditional Athenian aspirations. Vlachos asserts that Alcibiades had already conceived a broader plan: the conquest of the whole West. He intended to conquer Carthage and Libya, then to attack Italy and, after winning these, to seize Italy and Peloponnesus. The initial decision of the ecclesia provided however for a reasonable military force, which later became unreasonably large and costly because of Nicias&#x27;s demands. Kagan criticizes Alcibiades for failing to recognize that the large size of the Athenian expedition undermined the diplomatic scheme on which his strategy rested.

Kagan believes that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, he was no military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet in the hands of an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians&#x27; extravagant opinion of Alcibiades&#x27;s abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.

Press argues that &quot;though Alcibiades can be considered a good general on the basis of his performance in the Hellespont, he would not be considered so on the basis of his performance in Sicily&quot;, but &quot;the strengths of Alcibiades&#x27;s performance as a general outweigh his faults&quot;.

===Skill in oratory===
Plutarch asserts that &quot;Alcibiades was a most able speaker in addition to his other gifts&quot;, while Theophrastus argues that Alcibiades was the most capable of discovering and understanding what was required in a given case. Nevertheless, he would often stumble in the midst of his speech, but then he would resume and proceed with all the caution in the world. Even the lisp he had, which was noticed by Aristophanes, made his talk persuasive and full of charm. Eupolis says that he was &quot;prince of talkers, but in speaking most incapable&quot;; which is to say, more eloquent in his private discourses than when orating before the ecclesia. For his part, Demosthenes underscores the fact that Alcibiades was regarded as &quot;the ablest speaker of the day&quot;. Paparrigopoulos does not accept Demosthenes&#x27;s opinion, but acknowledges that the Athenian statesman could sufficiently support his case. Kagan acknowledges his rhetorical power, whilst Thomas Habinek, professor of classics at the University of Southern California, believes that the orator Alcibiades seemed to be whatever his audience needed on any given occasion. According to Habinek, in the field of oratory, the people responded to Alcibiades&#x27;s affection with affection of their own. Therefore, the orator was &quot;the institution of the city talking to—and loving—itself&quot;. According to Aristophanes, Athens &quot;yearns for him, and hates him too, but wants him back&quot;.

==References in popular culture==

Alcibiades has not been spared by ancient comedy, and stories attest to an epic confrontation between Alcibiades and Eupolis resembling that between Aristophanes and Cleon. He also appears as a character in several Socratic dialogues (&quot;Symposium&quot;, &quot;Protagoras&quot;, &quot;Alcibiades I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, where he is depicted as a lover and student of Socrates, as well as the eponymous dialogues by Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes). Purportedly based on his own personal experience, Antisthenes described Alcibiades&#x27;s extraordinary physical strength, courage, and beauty, saying, &quot;If Achilles did not look like this, he was not really handsome.&quot; In his trial, Socrates rebuts the attempt to hold him guilty for the crimes of his former students, including Alcibiades. Hence, he declares in &quot;Apology&quot;: &quot;I have never been anyone&#x27;s teacher&quot;.

Alcibiades has been depicted regularly in art, both in Medieval and Renaissance works, and in several significant works of modern literature as well. He is a major character in Shakespeare and Thomas Middleton&#x27;s tragicomic play &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, speaking no less than 7% of total lines and appearing in five scenes at the beginning, middle, and ending of the play. He has been the main character in historical novels of authors like Anna Bowman Dodd, Gertrude Atherton, Mary Renault, Rosemary Sutcliff, Daniel Chavarria, Steven Pressfield, Peter Green, and Ilja Leonard Pfeijffer.

Alcibiades is also involved in the plot of the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot;, under the name Alkibiades.

Alcibiades&#x27;s military prowess was cited by the eponymous character in the Academy Award winner for best picture in 1970, &quot;Patton&quot;, within a scene in which Allied generals discuss possible plans for their forthcoming invasion of Sicily in 1943 during a lavish dinner hosted by U.S. Lieutenant general George S. Patton Jr.

<text>The Love Parade is a 1929 American pre-Code musical comedy film, directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, involving the marital difficulties of Queen Louise of Sylvania (MacDonald) and her consort, Count Alfred Renard (Chevalier). Despite his love for Louise and his promise to be an obedient husband, Count Alfred finds his role as a figurehead unbearable. The supporting cast features Lupino Lane, Lillian Roth and Eugene Pallette.

The film was directed by Lubitsch from a screenplay by Guy Bolton and Ernest Vajda adapted from the French play &quot;Le Prince Consort&quot;, written by Jules Chancel and Leon Xanrof. The play had previously been adapted for Broadway in 1905 by William Boosey and Cosmo Gordon Lennox.

&quot;The Love Parade&quot; is notable for being both the film debut of Jeanette MacDonald and the first &quot;talkie&quot; film made by Ernst Lubitsch. The picture was also released in a French-language version called &quot;Parade d&#x27;amour&quot;. Chevalier had thought that he would never be capable of acting as a Royal courtier, and had to be persuaded by Lubitsch. This huge box-office hit appeared just after the Wall Street crash, and did much to save the fortunes of Paramount.

==Plot==

Count Alfred (Maurice Chevalier), military attaché to the Sylvanian Embassy in Paris, is ordered back to Sylvania to report to Queen Louise for a reprimand following a string of scandals, including an affair with the ambassador&#x27;s wife. In the meantime Queen Louise (Jeanette MacDonald), ruler of Sylvania in her own right, is royally fed-up with her subjects&#x27; preoccupation with whom she will marry (particularly since they would only be a prince consort)

Intrigued rather than offended by Count Alfred&#x27;s dossier, Queen Louise invites him to dinner when she tries to find a suitable &quot;punishment&quot; for him. Their romance progresses to the point of marriage when, despite his qualms, for love of Louise Alfred agrees to obey the Queen. However, he soon chafes at the standards of living as a consort, which mainly consist of little to do (where even trying to make suggestions to affairs of state) that forces him to take action.

==Cast==
* Maurice Chevalier as Count Alfred Renard
* Jeanette MacDonald as Queen Louise
* Lupino Lane as Jacques
* Lillian Roth as Lulu
* Eugene Pallette as Minister of War
* E. H. Calvert as Sylvanian Ambassador
* Edgar Norton as Master of Ceremonies
* Lionel Belmore as Prime Minister
* Virginia Bruce as Lady-in-Waiting (Uncredited)

==Production==
Although &quot;The Love Parade&quot; was Lubitsch&#x27;s first sound film, he already displayed a mastery of the technical requirements of the day. In one scene, two couples sing the same song alternately. To do this with the available technology, Lubitsch had two sets built, with an off-camera orchestra between them, and directed both scenes simultaneously. This enabled him to cut back and forth from one scene to the other in editing, something unheard of at the time.

==Music==
All songs are by Victor Schertzinger (music) and Clifford Grey (lyrics):

* &quot;Ooh, La La&quot; – sung by Lupino Lane
* &quot;Paris, Stay the Same&quot; – sung by Maurice Chevalier and Lupino Lane
* &quot;Dream Lover&quot; – sung by Jeanette MacDonald and chorus, reprise sung by Jeanette MacDonald
* &quot;Anything to Please the Queen&quot; – sung by Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier
* &quot;My Love Parade&quot; – sung by Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Common&quot; – sung by Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth
* &quot;March of the Grenadiers&quot; – sung by Jeanette MacDonald and chorus, reprise sung by chorus
* &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Using It Now&quot; – sung by Maurice Chevalier
* &quot;The Queen Is Always Right&quot; – sung by Lupino Lane, Lillian Roth and chorus

==Awards and honors==
&quot;The Love Parade&quot; was nominated for six Academy Awards:

1929–1930 Academy Awards

<text>Alice Adams is a 1921 novel by Booth Tarkington that received the 1922 Pulitzer Prize for the Novel. It was adapted as a film in 1923 by Rowland V. Lee and more famously in 1935 by George Stevens. The narrative centers on the character of a young woman (the eponymous Alice Adams) who aspires to climb the social ladder and win the affections of a wealthy young man named Arthur Russell. The story is set in a lower-middle-class household in an unnamed town in the Midwest shortly after World War I.

==Plot==

The novel begins with Virgil Adams confined to bed with an unnamed illness. There is tension between Virgil and his wife over how he should go about recovering, and she pressures him not to return to work for J.A. Lamb once he is well. Alice, their daughter, attempts to keep peace in the family, with mixed results, and she walks to her friend Mildred Palmer&#x27;s house to see what Mildred will wear to a dance that evening.

After Alice&#x27;s return, she spends the day preparing for the dance and goes to pick violets for a bouquet because she cannot afford to buy flowers for herself. Her brother Walter initially refuses to accompany her to the dance, but because Alice cannot go without an escort, Mrs. Adams prevails upon Walter into renting a Tin Lizzie to drive Alice to the dance.

Walter&#x27;s attitude towards the upper class is one of obvious disdain. He would rather spend his time gambling with the African-American servants in the cloakroom than be in the ballroom at the dance. Alice forces him to dance with her at first because it will be a grave embarrassment for her to stand alone, but Walter eventually abandons her. Alice tries to give the impression that she is not standing by herself, and she then dances with Frank Dowling, whose attentions she does not welcome, and Arthur Russell, a rich newcomer to town who is rumored to be engaged to Mildred and whom she believes to have danced with her out of pity and at Mildred&#x27;s request. She leaves the dance and is horribly embarrassed after Arthur discovers Walter gambling with the servants.

The next day, Alice goes into town on an errand for her father and passes Frincke&#x27;s Business College on the way with a shudder since she sees it as a place that drags promising young ladies down to &quot;hideous obscurity.&quot; On the walk back home, she encounters Arthur Russell, who shows an obvious interest in her. As she assumes that he is all but spoken for, she does not know how to handle the conversation. She warns him not to believe the things girls like Mildred will say about her, and she tells a number of lies to obscure her family&#x27;s humble economic status.

Arthur returns several days later, and his courtship of Alice continues. All seems well between them until he mentions a dance being thrown by the young Miss Henrietta Lamb. Arthur wants to escort Alice to the dance, and she lies to cover up that she was not invited. Mrs. Adams uses Alice&#x27;s distress to finally goad Virgil into setting up a glue factory, which she has long insisted would be the family&#x27;s ticket to success. It is eventually revealed that the glue recipe was developed by Virgil and another man under the direction and in the employ of J.A. Lamb, who, over the years, declined to take up its production despite repeated prodding from Virgil. Although he is initially reluctant to &quot;steal&quot; from Mr. Lamb, Virgil finally persuades himself that his improvements to the recipe over the years has made it his.

As Arthur continues his secret courtship of Alice (he never talks about her or tells anyone where he spends his evenings), Alice continues spinning a web of lies to preserve the image of herself and her family that she has invented. That becomes especially difficult when she and Arthur encounter Walter in a bad part of town when he is walking with a young woman, who gives the appearance of being a prostitute. At home, Walter is confronted by his father, who demands Walter quit Lamb&#x27;s to help in setting up the glue factory. Walter refuses to help his father without a $300 cash advance, which Virgil cannot afford.

Virgil arranges to resign from Lamb&#x27;s employ without speaking to him face to face because he fears the old man&#x27;s reaction, and he puts the glue factory into operation. Meanwhile, Alice works frantically to convince Arthur that the things other people will say about her are not true, and she continues to press the point even when Arthur insists that no one has spoken about her behind her back and that nothing anyone else could say would change his opinion of her. Mrs. Adams decides to arrange a dinner so that Arthur can meet the family and sets about planning an elaborate meal and hiring servants for the day so that Arthur will be impressed.

Walter again demands cash from his father (the amount has now risen to $350) without explaining why he needs it, and he again is rebuffed. While the events occur at the Adams house, Arthur finally overhears things about Alice, and her family, that strike a chord, including the fact that Virgil Adams has &quot;stolen&quot; from J.A. Lamb in setting up a factory with Lamb&#x27;s secret recipe for glue.

The dinner is a total disaster since the day is unbearably hot, the food is far too heavy, and the hired servants are surly and difficult to manage. That is capped by Virgil&#x27;s unwittingly acting like his lower-middle-class self, not the well-to-do businessman that his wife and daughter wish him to act like. Arthur, still reeling from what he heard about the Adamses earlier in the day, is stiff and uneasy throughout the evening, and Alice feels increasingly uncomfortable. By the end of the night, it is apparent to her that he will not come courting again, and she bids him farewell. That night, word reaches the family that Walter has skipped town and leaves behind him a massive debt to J.A. Lamb, which will have to be paid to keep Walter out of jail.

The following morning, Virgil arrives at work to see that Lamb is opening his own glue factory on such a huge scale that Adams will not be able to compete, and he never will make enough money to either pay his son&#x27;s debts or pay off the family&#x27;s mortgage.

Virgil confronts Lamb about the situation, works himself into such a state that he collapses, and returns to the same sickbed where he was at the beginning of the book. Lamb takes pity on the man and arranges to buy the Adams glue factory for a price sufficient to pay off Walter&#x27;s debts and the family&#x27;s mortgage. The Adams family takes in boarders to help keep the family afloat economically, and Alice heads downtown to Frincke&#x27;s Business College to train herself in employable skills so that she can support the family. She encounters Arthur on the road and is pleased that their conversation is both polite and brief. She calmly accepts that there is no possibility of renewing the romance between them.
