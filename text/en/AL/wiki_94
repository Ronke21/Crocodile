<text>Robert Underdunk Terwilliger Jr., PhD, better known as Sideshow Bob, is a recurring character and antagonist in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is voiced by Kelsey Grammer and first appeared in the episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. Bob is a self-proclaimed genius who is a graduate of Yale University and a champion of high culture, including the adoption of a transatlantic accent, similar to that of Grammer&#x27;s portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane from the sitcoms &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;. He began his career as a sidekick on Krusty the Clown&#x27;s television show, but after enduring constant abuse, Bob framed his employer for armed robbery in &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;, only to be foiled by Bart Simpson, and sent to prison. Bob started seeking revenge against Bart while in prison, and the two became feuding arch-enemies.

Bob made his second major appearance in season three&#x27;s &quot;Black Widower&quot;; the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart&#x27;s life, threatening to disrupt and end it through murder. Starting with that appearance and thereafter, Bob has assumed the role on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; of an evil genius. Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan, usually foiled by Bart and Lisa. His plans often involve death and destruction, usually targeted at Bart or, less often, Krusty, though he starts targeting the entire Simpson family in season 17. In season 27, however, during the first segment of &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXVI&quot;, entitled &quot;Wanted: Dead, Then Alive&quot;, Bob finally gets his wish of killing Bart, commenting that he spent 24 years trying to kill a ten-year-old child; however, he becomes bored with Bart dead, so he brings him back to life so that he can repeatedly kill Bart over and over again.

Despite his villainous deeds, Sideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer character Frasier Crane, and he has been described as &quot;Frasier pickled in arsenic&quot;. Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; between Bob and Frasier Crane—Bob&#x27;s brother Cecil and his father were played by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney, respectively, echoing the roles they played in &quot;Frasier&quot;. Grammer, who based Bob&#x27;s voice on that of actor Ellis Rabb, has been praised for his portrayals of the character. In 2006, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work in the episode &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;.

As of season 36, Sideshow Bob has appeared in more than 40 episodes, had speaking appearances in 25 of these, and been featured as the main character in 15. The most recent of the latter, &quot;The Yellow Lotus&quot;, aired during the 36th season, and his most recent speaking appearance was in &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXXIV&quot; in the 35th season. In addition to his recurring role in the series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other &quot;Simpsons&quot; media and is mentioned in several more episodes. He appears in the &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, the 2007 video game &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;, and stars as the main antagonist in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Ride at Universal Studios&#x27; theme parks. A lover of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, Sideshow Bob is also known for his singing voice; several of Grammer&#x27;s performances have been included in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; musical compilations.

==Appearances==

===On &quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
The character of Sideshow Bob began his career as the non-speaking sidekick who would only use a 
whistle 
on Krusty the Clown&#x27;s television show. Bob first appears in &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; (season 1, 1990). In the episode, he and Krusty plan a big event for whoever knows information of who captured the head of Jebediah Springfield&#x27;s statue, and joins in on the town mob when it is discovered that Bart Simpson took it. However, after repeated instances of abuse, including being shot from a cannon and hit constantly with pies, the Yale-educated Bob became angry with Krusty and resentful of the clown&#x27;s success. 

In &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; (season 1, 1990), Bob disguised himself as Krusty and framed him for armed robbery of the Kwik-E-Mart. After Krusty is arrested, Bob takes control of the show, introducing children to elements of high culture. However, Bob&#x27;s reign is short-lived; Bart exposes him as the robber, Krusty is released, and Bob is fired and sent to jail.

In &quot;Black Widower&quot; (season 3, 1992), Bob&#x27;s first major appearance after framing Krusty, he is released from prison and marries Bart&#x27;s aunt Selma Bouvier as part of a scheme to inherit money she has invested in the stock market. Bob attempts to blow Selma up during their honeymoon, but Bart again foils the plan and Sideshow Bob returns to prison.

After being paroled from prison in &quot;Cape Feare&quot; (season 5, 1993), Bob targets Bart directly, threatening him repeatedly and forcing the Simpsons into hiding as part of the Witness Relocation Program. Bob follows them to their hideout, a houseboat on Terror Lake, and, after subduing the family, prepares to kill Bart. He allows a final request, however, and Bart asks to hear Bob sing the entire score of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. Although Bob finishes singing and nearly kills Bart, the delaying tactic leads to Bob&#x27;s third arrest as the houseboat had drifted all the way back to Springfield.

Bob is released from prison once again in &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot; (season 6, 1994), and runs for Mayor of Springfield as the Republican Party candidate. He defeats Democratic Party incumbent Joe Quimby in a landslide, but Bart and Lisa discover from Waylon Smithers that Bob rigged the election by using the names of deceased people. Bob is put on trial and claims himself innocent, but is tricked by Bart and Lisa to expose himself guilty, leading to another incarceration.

Sideshow Bob escapes from prison for the first time in &quot;Sideshow Bob&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; (season 7, 1995), and threatens to blow up Springfield with a nuclear bomb unless the city stops broadcasting all television shows. He is thwarted when he finds out that the bomb itself is a dud, then kidnaps Bart and flies the Wright Brothers&#x27; plane in an attempt to kill himself, Bart, and Krusty (who is hiding inside a shack, improvising a performance on the Emergency Broadcast System). This too is thwarted, and Bob returns to prison.

In the following season, Bob takes advantage of the prison&#x27;s work release program, and appears to be genuinely redeemed. &quot;Brother from Another Series&quot; (season 8, 1997) reveals that Bob only became Krusty&#x27;s sidekick after his younger brother Cecil failed an audition ten years prior, because Krusty considered Bob to be a perfect comic foil. Reverend Lovejoy declares him a changed man and recommends him for a work release opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of Cecil, who is now Springfield&#x27;s chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. However, the scheming Cecil, still smarting over his failed audition for Krusty, tries to frame Bob by sabotaging the Springfield Dam by having it burst across Springfield. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and save the town, and both brothers, despite Bob&#x27;s genuine innocence, are sent to prison.

Bob returned in &quot;Day of the Jackanapes&quot; (season 12, 2001), where he discovers in prison that Krusty has erased all of the early shows featuring Sideshow Bob as Krusty himself is declaring his fifth and final retirement after being annoyed with the network executives. Bob is released from prison and develops a plot to kill Krusty using Bart as a suicide bomber during Krusty&#x27;s retirement special. Everything goes just as Bob had planned, and just when Bob was about to succeed in murdering both his enemies, he overhears Krusty publicly holding himself responsible for turning Bob into a criminal, expressing his regret of mistreating Bob during his years as Sideshow. To appease things, Krusty sings himself a song on Bob&#x27;s behalf, and being touched by this, Bob decides to abort his plan of attempted murder and reconciles with Krusty, although he is returned to prison for it.

Bob&#x27;s aid is sought by Springfield police in &quot;The Great Louse Detective&quot; (season 14, 2002). After an attempt is made on Homer Simpson&#x27;s life, Bob is released from prison to help find the culprit. During the adventure, Bob is given advice to kill Bart without hesitation, instead of being tricked into delay or screwing up on his plots. When the mystery is solved (it was Frank Grimes&#x27;s son), he returns to murder Bart. However, Bob finds he is &quot;accustomed to his [Bart&#x27;s] face&quot; and cannot do it.

In &quot;The Italian Bob&quot; (season 17, 2005), it is revealed that Bob had moved to Italy to make a fresh start. He was eventually elected mayor of the village of Salsiccia in Tuscany and marries a local woman named Francesca, with whom he has a son named Gino. The Simpson family, in Italy to retrieve a car for Mr. Burns, encounters him by chance. Bob welcomes them with hospitality on the condition that they not reveal his dark felonious past; however, a drunken Lisa jokes about Bob&#x27;s criminal deeds and reveals his prison uniform, alienating Bob from his citizens. Bob is angered enough to change his dream of killing Bart to killing the whole Simpson family. Upon catching up to Bob, his wife and his son swear a vendetta with him on all the Simpsons.

The entire Terwilliger family returns in &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot; (season 19, 2007) in which Bob&#x27;s father, Robert Terwilliger Sr., and mother, Dame Judith Onderdonk, make their first appearances. Cecil also appears a second time on the show. Bob at first attempts to kill the whole family a second time, but his plan fails. Bob fakes his own death during his trial and locks Bart in the coffin, which he attempts to cremate at the otherwise empty funeral home as all the Terwilligers laugh maniacally. They are foiled by Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family and sent to prison.

In &quot;Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes&quot; (season 20, 2008), Bob is one of the wanted criminals in Homer and Ned Flanders&#x27;s bounty hunter job despite already being in prison, which he escapes from at the end of the episode. In &quot;Wedding for Disaster&quot; (season 20, 2009), Bart and Lisa initially suspect Bob of kidnapping Homer to prevent him from attending his second wedding with Marge (due to a keychain they found had an &#x27;S&#x27; and a &#x27;B&#x27;), but Krusty provides him with an alibi, explaining to the kids that Bob was with him the whole day. Eventually, Bob and the kids discover the true culprits, Patty and Selma.
Bob also appears in “Coming to Homerica”, the 21st episode of Season 20, in a joke where the Simpson family enters the Cheers bar dressed as the Cheers cast when Sideshow Bob comes in dressed as Frasier Crane.

In &quot;O Brother, Where Bart Thou?&quot; (season 21, 2009), Bob makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in Bart&#x27;s dream sequence while the latter becomes desperate of having a younger brother. Cecil makes his third appearance in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; by appearing alongside Bob; the brothers are flying kites together. Bob reappears again in the episode &quot;The Bob Next Door&quot; (season 21, 2010). He switches faces with his prison cellmate Walt Warren. Bob returns to Springfield and moves into the house next to the Simpson family, assuming Walt&#x27;s identity. He exploits this to make his latest attempt to kill Bart legally over state lines, but is foiled again and gets taken away by state police.

Bob appears in &quot;At Long Last Leave&quot; (season 23, 2012), the 500th episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He attends a town meeting to decide if the Simpson family should be banished from Springfield, and is one of many who express their desire for it to happen. He makes a silent appearance in &quot;Moonshine River&quot; (season 24, 2012), where he runs across the train tracks trying to kill Bart, but ends up getting hit by a train.

In &quot;The Man Who Grew Too Much&quot; (season 25, 2014), he was revealed to be a Chief Scientist for a genetic engineering company named Monsarno, having received the position after he was selected as a test subject and published the results of the experiments to which he was subjected. He and Lisa bond over their interest in Walt Whitman, but Bob reveals that he has also genetically modified himself to give himself various superhuman abilities, intending to acquire DNA from the relics of various historical figures stored in the Springfield Museum to make himself a superhuman dictator. After tempted into a murderous rage, he chases down Bart and Lisa and is about to kill them but however, he is provoked into a fight and he realizes that he has become a crude monster and jumps off the Springfield Dam. The episode ends with Bob underwater in the lake, shown to have survived because the gills he gave himself allow him to live.

Bob also appears in &quot;Clown in the Dumps&quot; (season 26, 2014). Having returned to prison, he offered his condolences to Krusty after the death of his father, Rabbi Krustofsky. Several episodes later, Bob returned in &quot;Blazed and Confused&quot; (season 26, 2014), where he meets Mr. Lassen, Bart&#x27;s former teacher, who was now reduced to working in prison as a guard after Bart&#x27;s earlier actions at a &quot;Blazing Guy&quot; festival got him fired. Despite Lassen&#x27;s offer to get him out, Bob rejects the idea that they team up as Lassen thought that they would take turns gutting Bart.

In &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXVI&quot; (season 27, 2015), in the first segment called &quot;Wanted: Dead, then Alive&quot;, Bob uses Milhouse&#x27;s phone to trap Bart in the band classroom and successfully kills him. In peace with himself, Bob moves on from Bart to pursue other dreams, however, due to Bob chasing down Bart for so long, Bob finds his life so meaningless in Bart&#x27;s absence that he creates a machine to bring Bart back to life so that he can keep killing his enemy over and over, until the other Simpsons find Bob&#x27;s location and rescue Bart, and Bart uses the resurrection machine to turn Bob into a twisted amalgamation of creatures. Bob also appears in the episode &quot;Gal of Constant Sorrow&quot; (season 27, 2016), grunting in annoyance as he wipes off Bart&#x27;s graffiti from Hettie Mae Boggs&#x27; promo poster on the wall along with Snake Jailbird and other inmates.

Bob returns in &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXVII&quot; (season 28, 2016), the 600th episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In the opening sequence, he is the self-appointed leader of a four-member group consisting of Homer&#x27;s enemies, including Bob himself and the ghost of Frank Grimes. Wanting revenge once more, the group attempts to kill the Simpsons but is ultimately killed by Maggie, except Grimes&#x27;s ghost. In the ending sequence, Bob is one of the characters featured in the &quot;600&quot; song played by Judith Owen. In &quot;Havana Wild Weekend&quot; (season 28, 2016), Sideshow Bob appeared in the backgrounds at the Cuba&#x27;s check-in.

Bob also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in &quot;The Nightmare After Krustmas&quot; (season 28, 2016); he is amongst the crowd witnessing Krusty nearly drowning in a frozen lake while holding up a sign saying &quot;Die Clown&quot;. He&#x27;s had a major appearance in &quot;Gone Boy&quot; (season 29, 2017), when he tries to track down the whereabouts of Bart after he goes missing and is presumed dead. Bob finds Bart and proceeds to kill him and Milhouse, but saves them at the last minute due to the influence of the prison therapist&#x27;s lessons of potentially moving on from wanting to kill Bart. The epilogue features an older Bob, now known as Elder Bob, being a lighthouse keeper and still having regrets of not killing Bart.

In &quot;The Fat Blue Line&quot; (season 31, 2019), Bob escapes from prison once again, only to be hit by a rake truck. Several episodes later, in &quot;Bobby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; (season 31, 2019), he is hired to play Santa Claus at a theme park, and later helps the Simpsons discover who is stealing everyone&#x27;s Christmas gifts. Bob returned in a non-speaking cameo in &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot; (season 33, 2022), where he is seen signing the chests of citizens like Milhouse&#x27;s father Kirk Van Houten at the celebration of Krusty Burger&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a callback to the &quot;Die Bart, Die&quot; scene from &quot;Cape Feare&quot;.

In the &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXXIV&quot; segment &quot;Ei8ht&quot; (season 35, 2023), in an alternative ending to &quot;Cape Feare&quot;, Bob realizes that Bart is stalling his death by making him sing &quot;Pinafore&quot;, and as a result, kills him, traumatizing Lisa. 30 years later, the Springfield Police asks Professor Lisa Simpson to look into a series of murders committed by an unknown serial killer. Perplexed, Lisa seeks Bob&#x27;s help, but Bob just mocks Lisa. Later, Lisa realizes she herself has done all the murders. Bob is transferred to another prison cell to find Lisa waiting for her, revealing that a split personality emerged after the death of Bart and that she had committed all those murders in hopes of going to prison with Bob. To the music of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, Lisa gleefully slashes Bob to death.

In Season 36’s “The Yellow Lotus”, Bob has a minor role, as he is shown to be married and in the same resort with the Simpsons. When Marge tells Bob’s wife about his previous deeds, she throws him off of a cliff, only for Bob to survive and talk with Sideshow Mel.

===Other media===
In addition to regular roles in the television series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other &quot;Simpsons&quot; media. Kelsey Grammer recorded several Sideshow Bob lines for &quot;The Simpsons Movie,&quot; but the scene was cut; the deleted scene shows him amongst the angry mob, intent on killing Bart until he learns that the mob is apparently after Homer only, prompting him to leave in disappointment. Sideshow Bob has made regular appearances in the monthly &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, and several of Kelsey Grammer&#x27;s singing performances have been included in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; CD compilations. His performance of the &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in &quot;Cape Feare&quot; was later included on the album &quot;Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons,&quot; and the song &quot;The Very Reason That I Live&quot; from &quot;The Great Louse Detective&quot; was included on &quot;The Simpsons: Testify&quot;. A previously unaired song, &quot;Hullaba Lula&quot;, originally written for &quot;Day of the Jackanapes&quot;, was also included on that compilation. The producers modeled the song after &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;, but were forced to remove the song from the episode when they were unable to obtain the rights to it.

In &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;, released in November 2007, Bob has a speaking cameo appearance at the end of the chapter titled &quot;Invasion of the Yokel-Snatchers&quot; in which he was working with Kang and Kodos. Sideshow Bob appears in the 1991 &quot;The Simpsons Arcade Game&quot;, on the fifth level where he is pulling a cart containing a roast chicken health pick up. Bob was also included as a level boss in the 1991 video game &quot;Bart vs. the Space Mutants&quot;. Sideshow Bob plays a lead role in The Simpsons Ride, which opened at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2008. Voiced by Grammer, he is the main villain in the ride, having escaped from prison to get revenge on the Simpson family.

In &quot;The Simpsons: Tapped Out&quot;, a city-building game released in February 2012, Sideshow Bob occurs as a bonus. Popping up every couple hours, the players are given a chance to tap on him to receive a small sum of money, and &quot;send&quot; him to jail. In a later update to the game, Sideshow Bob also has a stand in Krusty Land, where players get to pop balloons for a chance to win donuts and Krusty tickets. The Simpsons: Tapped Out Terwilligers content update was released April 14, 2015 and has several references to the Simpsons episodes with Sideshow Bob. This game event was split in 3 acts and ended June 4, 2015. New characters, skins and costumes include Sideshow Bob, Cecil Terwilliger, Gino Terwilliger, Francesca Terwilliger, Dr. Robert Terwilliger Sr., Judith Onderdonk, Captain Bob, and Opera Krusty. Most of the event action takes place at Monsarno Research and Opera House.

==Character==

===Creation===

Sideshow Bob first appeared in &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;, the eighth episode of season 1. His design was relatively simple compared to later incarnations, and his hairstyle was rounded. However, towards the end of the episode, he appears again, in a panning shot of a crowd, with his familiar hairstyle. His second appearance, and first major one, was in season 1&#x27;s twelfth episode &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;, written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Bob&#x27;s design was updated for &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;; as the episode&#x27;s animation style evolved, director Brad Bird made the character of Sideshow Bob sleeker and more refined, to fit Grammer&#x27;s voice technique. Following the re-design, animators tried to redraw his scenes in &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;, but had insufficient time before the show was produced.

Bob has no lines of dialogue during the first half of &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;; the character&#x27;s only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would be surprised to hear his sophisticated vocabulary. An early version of the script for &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer. For Bob&#x27;s voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose &quot;lamenting tones became [the] foundation for Sideshow Bob&quot;.

Sideshow Bob&#x27;s full name is Robert Underdunk Terwilliger. His last name was first revealed in &quot;Black Widower&quot; while his middle name was first revealed in &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot;. Competing theories as to the origin of his name exist; some sources say he was named after the character Dr. Terwilliker, a megalomaniac outwitted by a boy named Bart in the film &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T&quot; by Dr. Seuss, but others say he was named after Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, Oregon. Yet another theory is that he was named after Sergeant Terwilliger and Mrs. Onderdonk in the pilot episode of the TV show &quot;Hunter&quot;.

===Development===
For season three&#x27;s &quot;Black Widower&quot;, the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner from &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart&#x27;s life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer Al Jean has compared Bob&#x27;s character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect. For &quot;Black Widower&quot;, director David Silverman updated the character model to reflect the animation of director Brad Bird. A rule for earlier episodes featuring Bob called for a recap of his evil deeds; this was dropped after season eight&#x27;s &quot;Brother from Another Series&quot; when the chronology became too lengthy. Another rule established by the show&#x27;s writers mandated Bob&#x27;s return to prison at the end of each episode, although this pattern was abandoned in later episodes like &quot;The Great Louse Detective&quot; and &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;.

Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, the showrunners for the seventh and eighth seasons, believed that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season, Bob had already been the focus of four episodes, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him. Weinstein describes Bob&#x27;s dialogue as difficult to write, due to his unique and refined style of speaking. Despite these challenges, however, creators of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; usually look forward to &quot;Sideshow Bob episodes&quot;; the writers consider them enjoyable to write, and former director Dominic Polcino describes them as &quot;a treat&quot; to work on. In &quot;Black Widower&quot;, Sideshow Bob notes that he is a &quot;life-long Republican&quot;.

Kelsey Grammer initially expected Sideshow Bob to be a one-time role, and calls him &quot;the most popular character I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;. Grammer usually joins the show&#x27;s &quot;table readings&quot; (wherein cast members read each script together for the first time), and former executive producer David Mirkin described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob&#x27;s evil laugh. In a 2007 interview, &quot;Simpsons&quot; executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying &quot;his voice is so rich.&quot; Writer George Meyer commented that &quot;writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give. And he can sing.&quot;

The show&#x27;s writers admire Grammer&#x27;s singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance. Alf Clausen, the primary composer for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, commented that &quot;[Grammer] is so great. He&#x27;s just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I&#x27;ve heard it.&quot; Clausen composed Sideshow Bob&#x27;s theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in &quot;Cape Feare&quot;. It is based on the score of the film &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical score for &quot;Cape Feare&quot; earned Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Underscore – Series in 1994.

Bob&#x27;s prisoner number is often 24601, which is Jean Valjean&#x27;s prisoner number in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. Another trademark for Bob is a visual gag of stepping on a rake and being struck in the face with its handle; this joke first appeared in &quot;Cape Feare&quot;. To fill time, the writers added nine consecutive iterations of the same joke in quick succession. The sequence has become known as the &quot;rake joke&quot; and was described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as showing &quot;genius in its repetitive stupidity.&quot;

===Family===

The episode &quot;Brother from Another Series&quot; introduces Bob&#x27;s brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler was assigned to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of &quot;Frasier&quot;. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer&#x27;s other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer&#x27;s brother on &quot;Frasier&quot;. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane&#x27;s brother Niles. Pierce commented, &quot;Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?&quot; Several of &quot;Frasier&quot; producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as &quot;Maris&quot;. In &quot;Frasier&quot;, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of &quot;Frasier&quot; asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.

Cecil returns in season 19&#x27;s &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot;, which introduces the brothers&#x27; previously unseen father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, played by John Mahoney. Mahoney portrayed Martin Crane, the father of Grammer&#x27;s and Pierce&#x27;s characters in &quot;Frasier&quot;. Whereas in &quot;Frasier&quot;, Mahoney played the &quot;down-to-Earth, average guy&quot; to Grammer&#x27;s and Hyde Pierce&#x27;s &quot;uppity snobs&quot;, Robert Terwilliger Sr. was portrayed as equally highbrow as Bob. His wife, Bob&#x27;s mother, is Dame Judith Onderdonk, &quot;the finest classical actress of her generation.&quot; She sports the same curly spiked hair as her two sons. Bob also has a wife named Francesca (voiced by Maria Grazia Cucinotta) and a son named Gino, both of whom were introduced in season 17 episode &quot;The Italian Bob&quot; and returned for &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot;.

==Reception==
The character of Sideshow Bob and Grammer&#x27;s voicework have received many accolades. In 2006, IGN listed him as the second-best &quot;peripheral character&quot; on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, commenting that Bob is &quot;a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree like hair, doesn&#x27;t seem to match up to the well spoken and even musically talented maniac.&quot; Also that year, &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine rated Bob as the 66th-greatest villain of all time. Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that &quot;that baritone voice, the Shakespearean delivery, and the ability to go from calm and collected to stark raving mad all within the same second make Sideshow Bob one of the best recurring characters on the show.&quot;

Kelsey Grammer has consistently received praise for his voicework, and has been described as &quot;brilliant&quot;, &quot;inimitable&quot; and &quot;a feast of mid-Atlantic anglophilia&quot;. In 2006, Grammer won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role in &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;; he had previously won four awards in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category for his portrayal of the title role on &quot;Frasier&quot;. In 2008, Grammer was included in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the sixteen best &quot;Simpsons&quot; guest stars; Hyde Pierce was also included in that list. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Kelsey Grammer&#x27;s grand voice-performance as Sideshow Bob is Frasier pickled in arsenic.&quot; In her book &quot;My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy&quot;, Nancy Cartwright (who performs the voice of Bart Simpson) wrote that &quot;Kelsey Grammer scores big-time by injecting caustic, bitter, contemptuous and deliciously vile energy into his rendition of Sideshow Bob. Springfield just wouldn&#x27;t be the same without him.&quot;

Most of the episodes featuring Bob have been well received by fans and critics. &quot;Cape Feare&quot; is generally regarded as one of the best episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and placed third on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s 2003 list of the show&#x27;s top 25 episodes. IGN considers it the best episode of the fifth season. In 2007, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called it the show&#x27;s fourth-best episode, because of its &quot;masterful integration of filmic parody and a recurring character&quot;. Ben Rayner of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; listed &quot;Cape Feare&quot;, &quot;Sideshow Bob&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; and &quot;Brother From Another Series&quot; among the best episodes of the series, writing &quot;forget &quot;Frasier&quot;, these are Kelsey Grammer&#x27;s best roles.&quot; &quot;The Italian Bob&quot; and its writer John Frink won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2007 in the animation category. In December 2009, Robert Canning of IGN ranked the ten episodes to feature Bob that had aired at the time. The first five Bob episodes took up the top five, with &quot;Cape Feare&quot; being ranked first. &quot;The Italian Bob&quot; was ranked tenth, with the explanation that &quot;All the things we love about a Sideshow Bob episode—the vengeance, the familiar settings and characters, the elaborate scheming—were missing from this half-hour. Without it, Bob wasn&#x27;t nearly as entertaining, and the episode didn&#x27;t result in a whole lot of laughs.&quot; He noted that only &quot;The Italian Bob&quot; and the ninth ranked &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot; were &quot;the only ones I&#x27;d consider clunkers. The remaining episodes are all quite fun.&quot;

The character&#x27;s line in &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot;, &quot;Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel prize for attempted chemistry?&quot;, briefly became an Internet meme after a similar defense of President Donald Trump was repeated after the Trump–Ukraine scandal.

===Analysis===
In &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, author Chris Turner writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book &quot;Leaving Springfield&quot;, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a &quot;mass-culture upbringing&quot; and thus is Bob&#x27;s enemy. Frustrated by his early role as the target of &quot;Krusty&#x27;s cheap gags&quot;, Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that &quot;Bob&#x27;s own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents.&quot; He also tries to &quot;manipulate the tastes of the masses&quot; by becoming a criminal mastermind. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot;, wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, &quot;Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who&#x27;ll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! That&#x27;s why I did this, to protect you from yourselves!&quot; He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.

Bob&#x27;s intelligence serves him in many ways. During the episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;, for example, the parole board asks Bob why he has a tattoo that says &quot;Die, Bart, Die&quot;. Bob replies that it is German for &quot;The, Bart, The&quot;; members of the board are impressed by his reasoning. Believing that &quot;nobody who speaks German could be an evil man&quot;, they release him. However, his love of high culture is sometimes used against him. In the same episode, Bob agrees to perform the operetta &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in its entirety as a last request for Bart. The tactic stalls Bob long enough for the police to arrest him.

<text>Winstead Sheffield &quot;Doodles&quot; Weaver (May 11, 1911 – January 16, 1983) was an American character actor, comedian, and musician.

Born into a wealthy West Coast family, Weaver began his career in radio. In the late 1930s, he performed on Rudy Vallée&#x27;s radio programs and &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;. He later joined Spike Jones&#x27; City Slickers. In 1957, Weaver hosted his own NBC variety show &quot;The Doodles Weaver Show&quot;. In addition to his radio work, he also recorded a number of comedy records, appeared in films and guest-starred on numerous television series from the 1950s through the 1970s. Weaver made his last onscreen appearance in 1981. Despondent over poor health, Weaver fatally shot himself in January 1983.

==Early life==
Weaver was born in Los Angeles, one of four children born to Sylvester Laflin Weaver, a wealthy roofing contractor, and Nellie Mabel (Amabel) Dixon Weaver. His older brother was Pat Weaver, who served as the president of NBC in the 1950s. Weaver&#x27;s niece is actress Sigourney Weaver. He was of English and Scottish ancestry with roots in New England. Weaver&#x27;s mother gave him the nickname &quot;Doodlebug&quot; as a child because of his freckles and big ears.

He attended Los Angeles High School and Stanford University. At Stanford, Weaver was a contributor to the &quot;Stanford Chaparral&quot; humor magazine. He was also known to engage in numerous pranks and practical jokes and earned the nickname &quot;The Mad Monk&quot;. He was reportedly suspended from Stanford in 1937 (the year he graduated) for pulling a prank on the train home from the Rose Bowl.

==Career==

===Radio and recordings===
On radio during the late 1930s and early 1940s, he was heard as an occasional guest on Rudy Vallée&#x27;s program and on the &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;.

In 1946, Weaver signed on as a member of Spike Jones&#x27;s City Slickers band. Weaver was heard on Jones&#x27;s 1947–49 radio shows, where he introduced his comedic Professor Feetlebaum (which Weaver sometimes spelled as Feitlebaum), a character who spoke in spoonerisms. Part of the Professor&#x27;s schtick was mixing up words and sentences in various songs and recitations as if he had myopia or dyslexia. Weaver toured the country with the Spike Jones Music Depreciation Revue until 1951. The radio programs were often broadcast from cities where the Revue was staged.

One of Weaver&#x27;s most popular recordings is the Spike Jones parody of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell Overture&quot;. Weaver gives a close impression of the gravel-voiced sports announcer Clem McCarthy in a satire of a horse race announcer who forgets whether he&#x27;s covering a horse race or a boxing match (&quot;It&#x27;s Girdle in the stretch! Locomotive is on the rail! Apartment House is second with plenty of room! It&#x27;s Cabbage by a head!&quot;). The race features a nag named Beetlebaum, who begins at long odds, runs the race a distant last—and yet suddenly emerges as the winner. The oft-repeated &quot;Beetlebaum&quot; became so identified with the record that RCA reprinted the record label, adding &quot;Beetlebaum&quot; in parentheses after the song title. Jones and Weaver followed this hit with a 1949 parody of the Indianapolis 500 automobile race, again with Weaver as commentator, set to Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;. The surprise winner? Beetlebaum. When an angry listener named Beetlebaum threatened a lawsuit, Weaver changed the name to Feitlebaum.

In 1966, Weaver recorded a novelty version of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;—singing, mixing up the words, insulting, and interrupting, while playing the piano.

===Writing===
Weaver was a contributor to the early &quot;Mad&quot;, as described by &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s Richard Corliss:
:Among the funny stuff: Doodles Weaver&#x27;s strict copy editing of the Gettysburg Address, advising Lincoln to change &quot;fourscore and seven&quot; to eighty-seven (&quot;Be specific&quot;), noting that there are six &quot;dedicates&quot; (&quot;Study your Roget&quot;), wondering if &quot;proposition&quot; isn&#x27;t misspelled and, finally exasperated, urging the writer to omit &quot;of the people, by the people, for the people&quot; as &quot;superfluous.&quot;

===Films and television===
Weaver made his television debut on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; in 1951. He performed an Ajax cleanser commercial with a pig, and the audience reaction prompted the network to give him his own series. In 1951, &quot;The Doodles Weaver Show&quot; was NBC&#x27;s summer replacement for Sid Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;; it was telecast from June to September with Weaver, his wife Lois, vocalist Marian Colby, and the comedy team of Dick Dana and Peanuts Mann. The show&#x27;s premise involved Weaver dealing with an assignment to stage a no-budget television series using only the discarded costumes, sets and props left behind by more popular network television shows away for the summer. The series ended in July 1951.

Weaver went on to guest star on numerous television shows including &quot;The Spike Jones Show&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, and &quot;The Tab Hunter Show&quot;. He also hosted several children&#x27;s television series. In 1965, he starred in &quot;A Day With Doodles&quot;, a series of six-minute shorts sold as alternative fare to cartoons for locally hosted kiddie television programs. Each episode featured Weaver in a first-person plural adventure (e.g., &quot;Today we are a movie actor&quot;), portraying himself and, behind false mustaches and costume hats, all the other characters in slapstick comedy situations with a voice over narration and minimal sets. The ending credits would invariably list &quot;Doodles... Doodles Weaver&quot; and &quot;Everybody Else... Doodles Weaver.&quot;

He portrayed eccentric characters in guest appearances on such television series as &quot;Batman&quot; (where he played The Archer&#x27;s henchman Crier Tuck), &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;, &quot;Dragnet 1967&quot; and &quot;The Monkees&quot;. He appeared in more than 90 films, including &quot;The Great Imposter&quot; (1961), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) (as the man helping Tippi Hedren&#x27;s character with her rental boat), Jerry Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963), &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; (1961) and, in a cameo, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963). He appeared in &quot;Six Pack Annie&quot; (1975). His last movie was &quot;Earthbound&quot; (1981).

==Personal life==
Weaver was married four times and had three children. His first marriage was to Beverly Masterman in 1939. His second marriage, to Evelyn Irene Paulsen, ended with a divorce decree on December 22, 1948, but that decree was not recorded at that time. In 1949, Weaver&#x27;s third marriage was with nightclub dancer Lois Frisell, who had the marriage annulled in 1954.

Weaver&#x27;s fourth and final marriage was to actress Reita Anne Green in October 1957. They had two children before divorcing in 1969.

==Death==
On January 16, 1983, Weaver was discovered dead by his son Winston at his Burbank, California home. He died of two self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the chest. His death was ruled a suicide. Weaver&#x27;s son later said that his father had been despondent over his failing health. His funeral service was held on January 22 at Forest Lawn Mortuary in the Hollywood Hills. He was buried in Avalon Cemetery on Santa Catalina Island, California.

Weaver&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Golden Spike&quot;, remains unpublished.

==Filmography==


==In popular culture==
* Weaver&#x27;s horse race routine has been quoted and parodied by many performers over the years.
* A children&#x27;s board game called Homestretch featured horses named Cabbage, Banana, Girdle, and the misspelled/simplified &quot;Beetle Bohm.&quot; This was a direct lift of Weaver&#x27;s number, with Cabbage &quot;leading by a head&quot; and Beetle Bohm eventually winning the race.
* Mike Kazaleh&#x27;s comic &quot;The Adventures of Captain Jack&quot; took place on the planet Pootwattle and featured a character who used many of Weaver&#x27;s jokes and catchphrases, such as &quot;That&#x27;s a killer!&quot;
* A one-page Weaver contribution to &quot;Mad&quot; magazine #25, September 1955, had him as Professor Feetlebaum grading student Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address, complete with grammatical corrections and encouraging note despite the C minus.

<doc id="64917" wikidata="Q1511163" url="?curid=64917" title="Nelson Muntz">
<text>Nelson Mandela Muntz is a fictional character and the lead school bully from the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, where he is best known for his signature mocking laugh &quot;Haw-haw!&quot;. He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright. Nelson was first introduced in Season 1&#x27;s &quot;Bart the General&quot; as an antagonist, but later became more of an anti-hero, continuing to bully those weaker than him while occasionally showing a friendly and sensitive nature underneath. Nelson lives in poverty with his mother in a run-down home, and often shoplifts from convenience stores to get by.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Nelson is a 12-year-old student and bully at Springfield Elementary School. He is known to have terrorized virtually every child in Springfield at one point or another. Most often, it is the school nerds and less popular students, such as Milhouse and Martin, who are the subjects of his cruelty. Nelson shows the occasional glimpse of humanity, and other characters have warmed to him because of that; Lisa dates him briefly in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Date with Density&quot;, Marge informally adopts him in &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;, and Bart is shown as a friend to him several times, such as in &quot;[[The Haw-Hawed Couple] ]&quot;.

His family is also financially poor resulting in a dysfunctional day-to-day lifestyle. While some early episodes offer inconsistent histories (such as [[Lisa&#x27;s Date with Density|Nelson&#x27;s dad going insane and abandoning him]], [[A Milhouse Divided|Nelson&#x27;s parents divorcing because of his mom&#x27;s cough drop addiction]], or [[Bart the Mother|Nelson&#x27;s dad in prison while his mom &quot;has bigger problems&quot;]]), the current [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] story is that he lives in a dilapidated house with his mother, who works on the fringes of the sex industry, either as a waitress at [[Hooters]] or in a topless bar. The [[Characterisation|character design]] and voice portrayal of both parents have varied throughout the course of the series.

It is shown in many episodes that Nelson&#x27;s father abandoned him and his mother at an early age when he &quot;went to pick up some [[Pop-Tarts]],&quot; although later on in the series he was said to have gone to pick up a pack of cigarettes. In the fourth-season episode &quot;[[Brother from the Same Planet]],&quot; Nelson&#x27;s father is the children&#x27;s soccer coach who awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele&#x27;s Soccer and Acting Camp. Nelson&#x27;s father also appears briefly in the sixth-season episode &quot;[[Bart&#x27;s Girlfriend]],&quot; depicted capturing Nelson with a leash as the children run through the cornfields in an attempt to avoid attending church. He also appears in the ninth-season episode &quot;[[Bart Star]]&quot; to congratulate Nelson after a football game victory and take him to Hooters (with Nelson turning down the invitation because he &quot;doesn&#x27;t want to bother [his] Mom at work&quot;). Nelson&#x27;s father returns in the sixteenth-season episode &quot;[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]&quot;. It turns out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts, and had an [[Anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], covering 90% of his body with large [[tumors]]. Confused and facially deformed,he ran out of the store and encountered a [[circus]] that made him a part of its [[freak show]]. Whenever there are performances, circus attendees threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his reaction, preventing him from returning to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of Nelson (who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge).

Nelson is also a natural athlete. In the episode &quot;[[Bart Star]]&quot;, Nelson almost single-handedly carries the entire Springfield Pee-Wee football team. As the team quarterback, he also on one occasion catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease. In various episodes, he gives out the impression that he is a lot smarter than he may first appear. Nelson often points out painfully obvious things to adults and kids alike that take them longer to grasp. Another example is a running joke where Nelson does a class assignment that is implied to be of high quality. However, he is always brushed off by the teachers before he gets to show them his work. Another running joke, though, is Nelson presenting ridiculously simple assignments, such as repeatedly showing a can of tomato paste in Show and Tell, and a presentation on &quot;[[The Grapes of Wrath]]&quot;, consisting of himself crushing a [[bunch of grapes]] with a hammer, stating &quot;Here&#x27;s the grapes, and here&#x27;s the wrath!&quot; In later episodes, Nelson shows signs of being a tormented artist type, even [[Any Given Sundance|submitting a film]] to the [[Sundance Film Festival]] about his life as a child living in poverty with a single, unfit mother and no strong father figure. He memorably says in the documentary, &quot;I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.&quot;

In the episode &quot;[[Little Big Girl]]&quot;, it is revealed that Nelson is German-American. Ironically, in &quot;[[Much Apu About Nothing]]&quot;, Nelson picks on foreign exchange student [[Üter Zörker|Üter]] for being German during Springfield&#x27;s anti-immigration mania. He is shown to be a big fan of [[Andy Williams]] as he, Bart, Milhouse and Martin went to a concert performed by him in &quot;[[Bart on the Road]]&quot;.

In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, he was captured along with [[Sideshow Bob]], Principal Skinner, Jimbo Jones, and Apu by [[Stewie Griffin]].

==Relationships with other characters==
Even though in the first season (and for many seasons afterward) Nelson seemed to be [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]&#x27;s antagonist, he eventually becomes what can be considered Bart&#x27;s second closest friend after Milhouse.

In [[Bart the General|his debut episode]], Lisa was the initial target of Nelson&#x27;s friend. Nelson had two minions at first one of which snatched a box of cupcakes from Lisa which prompted Bart to defend her. Bart&#x27;s actions resulted in frequent beatings by Nelson and his gang, but finally ended when Bart received help from [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters|Herman]], who came up with the idea of standing up to Nelson and his gang by pelting them with [[water balloon]]s. From that point on, Nelson shows grudging respect for Bart, though he occasionally reverts to his past behaviour towards him.

Although still prone to violence, Nelson hangs out with Bart and his less popular friends, such as [[Milhouse Van Houten]] and occasionally even common bullying target [[Martin Prince]]. In &quot;[[The Debarted]]&quot;, it is shown that Nelson has become Bart&#x27;s &quot;other best friend&quot;, along with Milhouse. Nelson is shown participating in many things with Bart further proving they&#x27;re friends. Some of the activities they do consist of football, basketball, baseball, lacrosse, going to read comics, and playing pranks on people. They even competed on the same e-sports team and went to the world championship.

Nelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendency, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. In &quot;[[Lisa&#x27;s Date with Density]]&quot;, Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]], who believe that kissing girls is &quot;[[gay]]&quot; (despite the events that occurred revolving around Jimbo in &quot;[[New Kid On The Block]]&quot;).

He also punishes [[Sherri and Terri]] for tormenting Lisa by having a skunk spray on them. Another curious example of his &quot;good side&quot; is with Martin, a boy whom Nelson picks on perhaps more so than any other kid in town. Despite the utter cruelty, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any real hatred towards Martin and only does so to maintain his &#x27;tough guy&#x27; reputation. In &quot;[[Dial &#x27;N&#x27; for Nerder]]&quot;, when it is believed that Martin has died, Nelson endeavors to learn the truth and find Martin&#x27;s killers. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but also states that he is glad Martin is not dead. In this same episode, however, when Lisa tries to bribe him to not rat her out by offering to get back together with him, he rejects it. In another episode, it is revealed that both Martin and Nelson went to space camp and that Nelson was a loyal officer to Martin. (See &quot;[[I&#x27;m Spelling as Fast as I Can]]&quot;)

In &quot;[[Loan-a Lisa]]&quot;, Lisa uses $50 to help Nelson fund his bicycle company, which becomes a success. When Nelson almost drops out of school to spend more time on the company, Lisa is saddened and attempts to stop him from doing so, but eventually respects his decision after realizing he will not change despite the money used to fund it. Nelson eventually decides not to drop out after all and takes Lisa skating to make it up to her.

Though Nelson is often said to not really have friends aside from his on-and-off relationship with Bart and the others, Nelson sometimes hangs out with his fellow school bullies [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and (to a lesser extent) two smaller and younger fraternal twin minions known as the Weasels. Though only seen with them occasionally, Nelson is also ironically the leader of the school bullies (possibly by virtue of being the most often seen and most recognizable of the gang).

In &quot;[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]&quot;, [[Moe Szyslak]] appears briefly during a Muntz family reunion. The facial similarities between Moe and the Muntzes are surprisingly quite apparent and Moe&#x27;s childhood experiences and behaviour are somewhat relatable with Nelson&#x27;s. Moe briefly appears and claims that he is part of the family and is then shunned off-screen by the Muntzes&#x27; confused looks.

==Character==

&quot;[[The Simpsons]]&quot; creator [[Matt Groening]] named Nelson after the [[Nelson hold|wrestling hold of the same name]]. Cast member [[Nancy Cartwright]] voices the character, which first appeared in the fifth episode of the first season, &quot;[[Bart the General]]&quot; (1990). American voice actress [[Dana Hill]] was first supposed to provide Nelson&#x27;s voice and attended the [[read-through]] of the episode. However, as Cartwright wrote in her autobiography &quot;[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]&quot;, &quot;the producers were still putting together this ensemble of [actors] and, come Monday, at the recording, she was nowhere to be found and the part was assigned to me. I didn&#x27;t have time to ask why and I still don&#x27;t have a clue.&quot; Cartwright also commented that when she first found out she would be voicing Nelson, &quot;I asked myself, &#x27;What does a bully sound like?&#x27; Well... what you hear is what you get. When I first uttered, &#x27;I&#x27;ll get you after school, man!&#x27; I let out a sigh of relief when I got through the line and a double-sigh when it got a laugh.&quot;

By the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the [[List of writers of The Simpsons|writers]] began to explore the secondary characters of the show. &quot;[[Lisa&#x27;s Date with Density]]&quot; (season eight, 1996) was the first episode to center around Nelson and was used to explain why he acts the way he does. The idea of Nelson dating [[Lisa Simpson]] had already been around for a while, but this was the first time that the staff worked it into the show. Cartwright said in 2012 that she thinks Nelson &quot;has evolved the most out of all the characters I do. There&#x27;s a soft spot in him that the writers have found. He&#x27;s got this special attraction to Marge, and he sings these songs, and he&#x27;s got a crush on Lisa. There&#x27;s something about this poor kid – his mother works at Hooters, his dad went out to buy cigarettes and never came back. I wouldn&#x27;t want him to come over for dinner, but I really love doing his voice.&quot;

==Reception==
The episode &quot;[[The Haw-Hawed Couple]]&quot; in 2007 was nominated for the [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program]]. The writer of the episode [[Matt Selman]] was nominated for a [[Writers Guild of America Award]].

In his review of the season 22 episode &quot;[[Loan-a Lisa]]&quot;, Rowan Kaiser of &quot;[[The A.V. Club]]&quot; commented that Nelson&#x27;s character has undergone a &quot;Spikeification&quot;, in reference to the bully&#x27;s near-exclusive portrayal as being likable and vulnerable in later seasons of the program.

<doc id="64919" wikidata="Q188847" url="?curid=64919" title="Environmental science">
<text>Environmental science is an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates physics, biology, meteorology, mathematics and geography (including ecology, chemistry, plant science, zoology, mineralogy, oceanography, limnology, soil science, geology and physical geography, and atmospheric science) to the study of the environment, and the solution of environmental problems. Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during the Enlightenment. Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems.

Environmental studies incorporates more of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect.

Environmental scientists seek to understand the earth&#x27;s physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes, and to use that knowledge to understand how issues such as alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management, and the effects of global warming and climate change influence and affect the natural systems and processes of earth.
Environmental issues almost always include an interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Environmental scientists bring a systems approach to the analysis of environmental problems. Key elements of an effective environmental scientist include the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well as quantitative analysis.

Environmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific investigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by (a) the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to analyze complex environmental problems, (b) the arrival of substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental protocols of investigation and (c) the growing public awareness of a need for action in addressing environmental problems. Events that spurred this development included the publication of Rachel Carson&#x27;s landmark environmental book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; along with major environmental issues becoming very public, such as the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, and the Cuyahoga River of Cleveland, Ohio, &quot;catching fire&quot; (also in 1969), and helped increase the visibility of environmental issues and create this new field of study.

==Terminology==
In common usage, &quot;environmental science&quot; and &quot;ecology&quot; are often used interchangeably, but technically, ecology refers only to the study of organisms and their interactions with each other as well as how they interrelate with environment. Ecology could be considered a subset of environmental science, which also could involve purely chemical or public health issues (for example) ecologists would be unlikely to study. In practice, there are considerable similarities between the work of ecologists and other environmental scientists. There is substantial overlap between ecology and environmental science with the disciplines of fisheries, forestry, and wildlife.

== History ==

=== Ancient civilizations ===
Historical concern for environmental issues is well documented in archives around the world. Ancient civilizations were mainly concerned with what is now known as environmental science insofar as it related to agriculture and natural resources. Scholars believe that early interest in the environment began around 6000 BCE when ancient civilizations in Israel and Jordan collapsed due to deforestation. As a result, in 2700 BCE the first legislation limiting deforestation was established in Mesopotamia. Two hundred years later, in 2500 BCE, a community residing in the Indus River Valley observed the nearby river system in order to improve sanitation. This involved manipulating the flow of water to account for public health. In the Western Hemisphere, numerous ancient Central American city-states collapsed around 1500 BCE due to soil erosion from intensive agriculture. Those remaining from these civilizations took greater attention to the impact of farming practices on the sustainability of the land and its stable food production. Furthermore, in 1450 BCE the Minoan civilization on the Greek island of Crete declined due to deforestation and the resulting environmental degradation of natural resources. Pliny the Elder somewhat addressed the environmental concerns of ancient civilizations in the text &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;, written between 77 and 79 ACE, which provided an overview of many related subsets of the discipline.

Although warfare and disease were of primary concern in ancient society, environmental issues played a crucial role in the survival and power of different civilizations. As more communities recognized the importance of the natural world to their long-term success, an interest in studying the environment came into existence.

=== Beginnings of environmental science ===

==== 18th century ====
In 1735, the concept of binomial nomenclature is introduced by Carolus Linnaeus as a way to classify all living organisms, influenced by earlier works of Aristotle. His text, &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, represents one of the earliest culminations of knowledge on the subject, providing a means to identify different species based partially on how they interact with their environment.

==== 19th century ====
In the 1820s, scientists were studying the properties of gases, particularly those in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and their interactions with heat from the Sun. Later that century, studies suggested that the Earth had experienced an Ice Age and that warming of the Earth was partially due to what are now known as greenhouse gases (GHG). The greenhouse effect was introduced, although climate science was not yet recognized as an important topic in environmental science due to minimal industrialization and lower rates of greenhouse gas emissions at the time.


==== 20th century ====

In the 1900s, the discipline of environmental science as it is known today began to take shape. The century is marked by significant research, literature, and international cooperation in the field.

In the early 20th century, criticism from dissenters downplayed the effects of global warming. At this time, few researchers were studying the dangers of fossil fuels. After a 1.3 degrees Celsius temperature anomaly was found in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1940s, however, scientists renewed their studies of gaseous heat trapping from the greenhouse effect (although only carbon dioxide and water vapor were known to be greenhouse gases then). Nuclear development following the Second World War allowed environmental scientists to intensively study the effects of carbon and make advancements in the field. Further knowledge from archaeological evidence brought to light the changes in climate over time, particularly ice core sampling.

Environmental science was brought to the forefront of society in 1962 when Rachel Carson published an influential piece of environmental literature, &quot;Silent Spring&quot;. Carson&#x27;s writing led the American public to pursue environmental safeguards, such as bans on harmful chemicals like the insecticide DDT. Another important work, &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot;, was published by Garrett Hardin in 1968 in response to accelerating natural degradation. In 1969, environmental science once again became a household term after two striking disasters: Ohio&#x27;s Cuyahoga River caught fire due to the amount of pollution in its waters and a Santa Barbara oil spill endangered thousands of marine animals, both receiving prolific media coverage. Consequently, the United States passed an abundance of legislation, including the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The following year, in 1970, the first ever Earth Day was celebrated worldwide and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed, legitimizing the study of environmental science in government policy. In the next two years, the United Nations created the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Stockholm, Sweden to address global environmental degradation.

Much of the interest in environmental science throughout the 1970s and the 1980s was characterized by major disasters and social movements. In 1978, hundreds of people were relocated from Love Canal, New York after carcinogenic pollutants were found to be buried underground near residential areas. The next year, in 1979, the nuclear power plant on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania suffered a meltdown and raised concerns about the dangers of radioactive waste and the safety of nuclear energy. In response to landfills and toxic waste often disposed of near their homes, the official Environmental Justice Movement was started by a Black community in North Carolina in 1982. Two years later, the toxic methyl isocyanate gas was released to the public from a power plant disaster in Bhopal, India, harming hundreds of thousands of people living near the disaster site, the effects of which are still felt today. In a groundbreaking discovery in 1985, a British team of researchers studying Antarctica found evidence of a hole in the ozone layer, inspiring global agreements banning the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were previously used in nearly all aerosols and refrigerants. Notably, in 1986, the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine released radioactive waste to the public, leading to international studies on the ramifications of environmental disasters. Over the next couple of years, the Brundtland Commission (previously known as the World Commission on Environment and Development) published a report titled &quot;Our Common Future&quot; and the Montreal Protocol formed the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as international communication focused on finding solutions for climate change and degradation. In the late 1980s, the Exxon Valdez company was fined for spilling large quantities of crude oil off the coast of Alaska and the resulting cleanup, involving the work of environmental scientists. After hundreds of oil wells were burned in combat in 1991, warfare between Iraq and Kuwait polluted the surrounding atmosphere just below the air quality threshold s believed was life-threatening.

==== 21st century ====

Many niche disciplines of environmental science have emerged over the years, although climatology is one of the most known topics. Since the 2000s, environmental scientists have focused on modeling the effects of climate change and encouraging global cooperation to minimize potential damages. In 2002, the Society for the Environment as well as the Institute of Air Quality Management were founded to share knowledge and develop solutions around the world. Later, in 2008, the United Kingdom became the first country to pass legislation (the Climate Change Act) that aims to reduce carbon dioxide output to a specified threshold. In 2016 the Kyoto Protocol became the Paris Agreement, which sets concrete goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restricts Earth&#x27;s rise in temperature to a 2 degrees Celsius maximum. The agreement is one of the most expansive international efforts to limit the effects of global warming to date.

Most environmental disasters in this time period involve crude oil pollution or the effects of rising temperatures. In 2010, BP was responsible for the largest American oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, known as the Deepwater Horizon spill, which killed a number of the company&#x27;s workers and released large amounts of crude oil into the water. Furthermore, throughout this century, much of the world has been ravaged by widespread wildfires and water scarcity, prompting regulations on the sustainable use of natural resources as determined by environmental scientists.

The 21st century is marked by significant technological advancements. New technology in environmental science has transformed how researchers gather information about various topics in the field. Research in engines, fuel efficiency, and decreasing emissions from vehicles since the times of the Industrial Revolution has reduced the amount of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Furthermore, investment in researching and developing clean energy (i.e. wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal power) has significantly increased in recent years, indicating the beginnings of the divestment from fossil fuel use. Geographic information systems (GIS) are used to observe sources of air or water pollution through satellites and digital imagery analysis. This technology allows for advanced farming techniques like precision agriculture as well as monitoring water usage in order to set market prices. In the field of water quality, developed strains of natural and manmade bacteria contribute to bioremediation, the treatment of wastewaters for future use. This method is more eco-friendly and cheaper than manual cleanup or treatment of wastewaters. Most notably, the expansion of computer technology has allowed for large data collection, advanced analysis, historical archives, public awareness of environmental issues, and international scientific communication. The ability to crowdsource on the Internet, for example, represents the process of collectivizing knowledge from researchers around the world to create increased opportunity for scientific progress. With crowdsourcing, data is released to the public for personal analyses which can later be shared as new information is found. Another technological development, blockchain technology, monitors and regulates global fisheries. By tracking the path of fish through global markets, environmental scientists can observe whether certain species are being overharvested to the point of extinction. Additionally, remote sensing allows for the detection of features of the environment without physical intervention. The resulting digital imagery is used to create increasingly accurate models of environmental processes, climate change, and much more. Advancements to remote sensing technology are particularly useful in locating the nonpoint sources of pollution and analyzing ecosystem health through image analysis across the electromagnetic spectrum. Lastly, thermal imaging technology is used in wildlife management to catch and discourage poachers and other illegal wildlife traffickers from killing endangered animals, proving useful for conservation efforts. Artificial intelligence has also been used to predict the movement of animal populations and protect the habitats of wildlife.

==Components==

=== Atmospheric sciences ===

Atmospheric sciences focus on the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, with an emphasis upon its interrelation to other systems. Atmospheric sciences can include studies of meteorology, greenhouse gas phenomena, atmospheric dispersion modeling of airborne contaminants, sound propagation phenomena related to noise pollution, and even light pollution.

Taking the example of the global warming phenomena, physicists create computer models of atmospheric circulation and infrared radiation transmission, chemists examine the inventory of atmospheric chemicals and their reactions, biologists analyze the plant and animal contributions to carbon dioxide fluxes, and specialists such as meteorologists and oceanographers add additional breadth in understanding the atmospheric dynamics.

=== Ecology ===
As defined by the Ecological Society of America, &quot;Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment; it seeks to understand the vital connections between plants and animals and the world around them.&quot; Ecologists might investigate the relationship between a population of organisms and some physical characteristic of their environment, such as concentration of a chemical; or they might investigate the interaction between two populations of different organisms through some symbiotic or competitive relationship. For example, an interdisciplinary analysis of an ecological system which is being impacted by one or more stressors might include several related environmental science fields. In an estuarine setting where a proposed industrial development could impact certain species by water and air pollution, biologists would describe the flora and fauna, chemists would analyze the transport of water pollutants to the marsh, physicists would calculate air pollution emissions and geologists would assist in understanding the marsh soils and bay muds.

=== Environmental chemistry ===
Environmental chemistry is the study of chemical alterations in the environment. Principal areas of study include soil contamination and water pollution. The topics of analysis include chemical degradation in the environment, multi-phase transport of chemicals (for example, evaporation of a solvent containing lake to yield solvent as an air pollutant), and chemical effects upon biota.

As an example study, consider the case of a leaking solvent tank which has entered the habitat soil of an endangered species of amphibian. As a method to resolve or understand the extent of soil contamination and subsurface transport of solvent, a computer model would be implemented. Chemists would then characterize the molecular bonding of the solvent to the specific soil type, and biologists would study the impacts upon soil arthropods, plants, and ultimately pond-dwelling organisms that are the food of the endangered amphibian.

=== Geosciences ===
Geosciences include environmental geology, environmental soil science, volcanic phenomena and evolution of the Earth&#x27;s crust. In some classification systems this can also include hydrology, including oceanography.

As an example study, of soils erosion, calculations would be made of surface runoff by soil scientists. Fluvial geomorphologists would assist in examining sediment transport in overland flow. Physicists would contribute by assessing the changes in light transmission in the receiving waters. Biologists would analyze subsequent impacts to aquatic flora and fauna from increases in water turbidity.

==Regulations driving the studies==

In the United States the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 set forth requirements for analysis of federal government actions (such as highway construction projects and land management decisions) in terms of specific environmental criteria. Numerous state laws have echoed these mandates, applying the principles to local-scale actions. The upshot has been an explosion of documentation and study of environmental consequences before the fact of development actions.

One can examine the specifics of environmental science by reading examples of Environmental Impact Statements prepared under NEPA such as: &quot;Wastewater treatment expansion options discharging into the San Diego/Tijuana Estuary&quot;, &quot;Expansion of the San Francisco International Airport&quot;, &quot;Development of the Houston, Metro Transportation system&quot;, &quot;Expansion of the metropolitan Boston MBTA transit system&quot;, and &quot;Construction of Interstate 66 through Arlington, Virginia&quot;.

In England and Wales the Environment Agency (EA), formed in 1996, is a public body for protecting and improving the environment and enforces the regulations listed on the communities and local government site. (formerly the office of the deputy prime minister). The agency was set up under the Environment Act 1995 as an independent body and works closely with UK Government to enforce the regulations.

<doc id="64935" wikidata="Q43982" url="?curid=64935" title="Bartholomew the Apostle">
<text>Bartholomew was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. Most scholars today identify Bartholomew as Nathanael, who appears in the Gospel of John (1:45–51; cf. 21:2).

==New Testament references==
The name &quot;Bartholomew&quot; (, transliterated &quot;Bartholomaios&quot;) comes from the &quot;bar-Tolmay&quot; &quot;son of Talmai&quot; or &quot;son of the furrows&quot;. Bartholomew is listed in the New Testament among the Twelve Apostles of Jesus in the three Synoptic Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and in Acts of the Apostles.

==Tradition==

Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (5:10) states that after the Ascension, Bartholomew went on a missionary tour to India, where he left behind a copy of the Gospel of Matthew. Tradition narrates that he served as a missionary in Mesopotamia and Parthia, as well as Lycaonia and Ethiopia in other accounts.
Popular traditions say that Bartholomew preached the Gospel in India and then went to Greater Armenia.

===Mission to India===
Two ancient testimonies exist about the mission of Saint Bartholomew in India. These are by Eusebius of Caesarea (early 4th century) and by Saint Jerome (late 4th century). Both of these refer to this tradition while speaking of the reported visit of Saint Pantaenus to India in the 2nd century. The studies of Fr A.C. Perumalil SJ and Moraes hold that the Bombay region on the Konkan coast, a region which may also have been known as the ancient city Kalyan, was the field of Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s missionary activities. Previously the consensus among scholars was at least skeptical about an apostolate of Saint Bartholomew in India. Stallings (1703), Neander (1853), Hunter (1886), Rae (1892), Zaleski (1915) supported it, while scholars such as Sollerius (1669), Carpentier (1822), Harnack (1903), Medlycott (1905), Mingana (1926), Thurston (1933), Attwater (1935), etc. do not. The main argument is that the India that Eusebius and Jerome refer to should be identified as Ethiopia or Arabia Felix.

===In Armenia===

Along with his fellow apostle Jude &quot;Thaddeus&quot;, Bartholomew is reputed to have brought Christianity to Armenia in the 1st century; as a result, in 301 the Armenian kingdom became the first state in history to embrace Christianity officially. Thus, both saints are considered the patron saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church. According to these traditions, Bartholomew is the second Catholicos-Patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

Christian tradition offers three accounts of Bartholomew&#x27;s death: &quot;One speaks of his being kidnapped, beaten unconscious, and cast into the sea to drown.&quot;

In the Hellenic tradition, Bartholomew was executed in Albanopolis in Armenia, where he was martyred for having converted Polymius, the local king, to Christianity. Enraged by the monarch&#x27;s conversion, and fearing a Roman backlash, King Polymius&#x27;s brother, Prince Astyages, ordered Bartholomew&#x27;s torture and execution. However, this version of the story appears ahistorical, as there are no records of any Armenian king of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia with the name &quot;Polymius&quot;. Other accounts of his martyrdom name the king as either Agrippa (identified with Tigranes VI), or Sanatruk, king of Armenia.

The 13th-century Saint Bartholomew Monastery was a prominent Armenian monastery constructed at the presumed site of Bartholomew&#x27;s martyrdom in Vaspurakan, Greater Armenia (now in southeastern Turkey).

===In present-day Azerbaijan===
Azerbaijani Christians hold the official position that Apostle Bartholomew was the first person to bring Christianity to the lands of modern Azerbaijan and believe that he preached there. Saint Bartholomew Church (Baku) was built in 1892 with donations from the local Christian population on the site where the Apostle Bartholomew was believed to have been martyred. Azerbaijani Christians believe that in the area near the Maiden Tower, the apostle Bartholomew was crucified and killed by pagans around 71 AD. The church continued to operate until 1936, when it was demolished as a part of the Soviet campaign against religion.

== Veneration ==

The Armenian Apostolic Church honours Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thaddeus as its patron saints. 

The Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Bartholomew on June 11. Bartholomew is also venerated on August 25 in commemoration of the transfer of Bartholomew&#x27;s relics. He is also venerated as one of the twelve apostles on June 30.

In the Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Bartholomew&#x27;s martyrdom is commemorated on the first day of the Coptic calendar (i.e., the first day of the month of Thout), which currently falls on 11 September (corresponding to 29 August in the Julian calendar).

Hence, the Russian Orthodox Eparchy of Baku and Azerbaijan and Catholic Prefecture of Azerbaijan honour Saint Bartholomew as the Patron Saint of Azerbaijan and regards him as the bringer of Christianity to the region of Caucasian Albania, modern-day Azerbaijan. The feast day of the Apostle is solemnly celebrated there on 24 August by the Christian laity and the Church officials alike. 

In the current Roman General Calendar Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s feast occurs on 24 August.

Bartholomew the Apostle is remembered in the Church of England with a Festival on 24 August.

==Relics==

The 6th-century writer Theodorus Lector averred that in about 507, the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus gave the body of Bartholomew to the city of Daras, in Mesopotamia, which he had recently refounded. The existence of relics at Lipari, a small island off the coast of Sicily, in the part of Italy controlled from Constantinople, was explained by Gregory of Tours by his body having miraculously washed up there. A large piece of his skin and many bones that were kept in the Cathedral of St. Bartholomew in Lipari, were translated to Benevento in 838, where they are still kept in the Basilica San Bartolomeo. A portion of the relics was given in 983 by Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor, to Rome, where it is conserved at San Bartolomeo all&#x27;Isola, which was founded on the site of the temple of Asclepius, in pagan times an important Roman medical centre. This association with medicine caused Bartholomew&#x27;s name to become associated in course of time with hospitals. A part of Bartholomew&#x27;s alleged skull was transferred to the Frankfurt Cathedral, while an arm was venerated in Canterbury Cathedral. 
In 2003, Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople brought some of the remains of St. Bartholomew to Baku as a gift to Azerbaijani Christians, and these remains are now kept in the Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral.

Saint Bartholomew has been credited with several miracles.

==Art and literature==
In artistic depictions, Bartholomew is most commonly depicted holding his flayed skin and the knife with which he was skinned. Of this a well known example is featured in Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgement&quot;. 

Not rarely, Bartholomew is shown draping his own skin around his body. Moreover, representations of Bartholomew with a chained demon are common in Spanish painting.
St. Bartholomew is the most prominent flayed Christian martyr; During the 16th century, images of the flaying of Bartholomew were popular and this detail came to become a virtual constant of iconography. An echo of concentration on these details is found in medieval heraldry regarding Bartholomew, which depicts &quot;flaying knives with silver blades and gold handles, on a red field.&quot; 

Saint Bartholomew is often depicted in lavish medieval manuscripts. Bearing in mind that manuscripts are in fact made from flayed and manipulated skin, they hold a strong visual and cognitive association with the saint during the medieval period. 

Florentine artist Pacino di Bonaguida, depicts his martyrdom in a complex and striking composition in his Laudario of Sant&#x27;Agnese, a book of Italian Hymns produced for the Compagnia di Sant&#x27;Agnese . In the five-scene, narrative-based image, three torturers flay Bartholomew&#x27;s legs and arms as he is immobilised and chained to a gate. On the right, the saint wears his own skin tied around his neck while he kneels in prayer before a rock, his severed head lying on the ground. 

A further depiction is that of the &quot;Flaying of St. Bartholomew&quot; in the Luttrell Psalter –1340. There, Bartholomew is depicted lying on a surgical table, surrounded by tormentors while he is flayed with golden knives.

Due to the nature of his martyrdom, Bartholomew is the patron saint of tanners, plasterers, tailors, leatherworkers, bookbinders, farmers, housepainters, butchers, and glove makers. In works of art the saint has been depicted being skinned by tanners, as in Guido da Siena&#x27;s reliquary shutters with the &quot;Martyrdoms of St. Francis, St. Claire, St. Bartholomew, and St. Catherine of Alexandria&quot;. Popular in Florence and other areas in Tuscany, the saint also came to be associated with salt, oil, and cheese merchants.

&quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew&quot; (1634) by Jusepe de Ribera depicts Bartholomew&#x27;s final moments before being flayed alive. The viewer is meant to empathize with Bartholomew, whose body seemingly bursts through the surface of the canvas, and whose outstretched arms embrace a mystical light that illuminates his flesh. His piercing eyes, open mouth, and petitioning left hand bespeak an intense communion with the divine; yet this same hand draws our attention to the instruments of his torture, symbolically positioned in the shape of a cross. Transfixed by Bartholomew&#x27;s active faith, the executioner seems to have stopped short in his actions, and his furrowed brow and partially illuminated face suggest a moment of doubt, with the possibility of conversion. The representation of Bartholomew&#x27;s demise in the National Gallery painting differs significantly from all other depictions by Ribera. By limiting the number of participants to the main protagonists of the story (the saint, his executioner, one of the priests who condemned him, and one of the soldiers who captured him), and presenting them half-length and filling the picture space, the artist rejected an active, movemented composition for one of intense psychological drama. The cusping along all four edges shows that the painting has not been cut down: Ribera intended the composition to be just such a tight, restricted presentation, with the figures cut off and pressed together.

Although Bartholomew&#x27;s death is commonly depicted in artworks of a religious nature, his story has also been used to represent anatomical depictions of the human body devoid of flesh. An example of this can be seen in Marco d&#x27;Agrate&#x27;s &quot;St Bartholomew Flayed&quot; (1562) where Bartholomew is depicted wrapped in his own skin with every muscle, vein and tendon clearly visible, acting as a clear description of the muscles and structure of the human body.

This idea has influenced some contemporary artists to create an artwork depicting an anatomical study of a human body is found amongst with Gunther Von Hagens&#x27;s &quot;The Skin Man&quot; (2002) and Damien Hirst&#x27;s &quot;Exquisite Pain&quot; (2006). Within Gunther Von Hagens&#x27;s body of work called &quot;Body Worlds&quot; a figure reminiscent of Bartholomew holds up his skin. This figure is depicted in actual human tissues (made possible by Hagens&#x27;s plastination process) to educate the public about the inner workings of the human body and to show the effects of healthy and unhealthy lifestyles. In &quot;Exquisite Pain&quot; 2006, Damien Hirst depicts St Bartholomew with a high level of anatomical detail with his flayed skin draped over his right arm, a scalpel in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other. The inclusion of scissors was inspired by Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990).

Bartholomew plays a part in Francis Bacon&#x27;s Utopian tale &quot;New Atlantis&quot;, about a mythical isolated land, Bensalem, populated by a people dedicated to reason and natural philosophy. Some twenty years after the ascension of Christ the people of Bensalem find an ark floating off their shore. The ark contains a letter as well as the books of the Old and New Testaments. The letter is from Bartholomew the Apostle and declares that an angel told him to set the ark and its contents afloat. Thus the scientists of Bensalem receive the revelation of the Word of God.
== Culture ==
The festival in August has been a traditional occasion for markets and fairs, such as the Bartholomew Fair which was held in Smithfield, London, from the Middle Ages, and which served as the scene for Ben Jonson&#x27;s 1614 homonymous comedy.

St Bartholomew&#x27;s Street Fair is held in Crewkerne, Somerset, annually at the start of September. The fair dates back to Saxon times and the major traders&#x27; market was recorded in the Domesday Book. St Bartholomew&#x27;s Street Fair, Crewkerne is reputed to have been granted its charter in the time of Henry III (1207–1272). The earliest surviving court record was made in 1280, which can be found in the British Library.

==In Islam==
The Qur&#x27;anic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more or less agrees with the New Testament list and holds that the disciples included Peter, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Andrew, James, Jude, James the Less, John and Simon the Zealot.

Quoting Ibn Is-haq, Qurtubi gives the following details concerning the mission of the disciples of Jesus Christ: He sent Peter and Paul to the Roman lands; Andrew and Matthew to Cannibals; Thomas to Babylon; Philips to Africa; John to Damascus the town of the seven-sleeper; Jacob to Jerusalem; Ibn Talma (i.e., Bartholomew) to the Arab world; Simon to the Berbers; Yehuda and Bard to Alexandria. Allah aided them with points of right argument and they prevailed.

<text>Santa&#x27;s Little Helper is a fictional dog in the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is the pet greyhound of the Simpson family. He was previously voiced by Frank Welker, and is currently voiced by Dan Castellaneta. The dog was introduced in the first episode of the show, the 1989 Christmas special &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, in which his owner abandons him for finishing last in a greyhound race. Homer Simpson and his son Bart, who are at the race track in hope of winning some money for Christmas presents, see this and decide to adopt the dog.

Santa&#x27;s Little Helper has since appeared frequently on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and is the center of the plots of several episodes. During the course of the show, he has fathered litters of puppies, passed obedience school, had surgery for bloat, replaced Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer, and been trained as a police dog at Springfield&#x27;s Animal Police Academy. Some of the episodes that focus on Santa&#x27;s Little Helper have been inspired by popular culture or real experiences that staff members of the show have gone through.

Although most cartoon animals are often humanized, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper generally exhibits canine behavior. Santa&#x27;s Little Helper has become a popular character following his appearances on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He ranked 27th in Animal Planet&#x27;s 2003 television special &quot;50 Greatest TV Animals&quot; that was based on popularity, name recognition, and the longevity of the shows. He has also been featured in merchandise relating to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, such as video games, board games, and comics.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Santa&#x27;s Little Helper is a greyhound dog that appears on the animated television sitcom series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and is the pet dog of the Simpson family. He can often be seen on the show in minor appearances, although there have been some episodes that feature him heavily, including the first episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In that episode, &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; (season one, 1989), Homer discovers that he has no money to buy Christmas presents for the family. Desperate for a miracle, he and Bart go to the greyhound racing track on Christmas Eve in hopes of winning some money. Although Homer has inside information on which dog is the most likely to win, he instead bets on a last-minute entry, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper (here despite being brown), believing the dog&#x27;s Christmas-inspired name to be a sign. However, the greyhound finishes last. As Homer and Bart leave the track, they watch the dog&#x27;s owner abandon him for losing the race. Bart pleads with Homer to keep the dog as a pet and he agrees after it affectionately licks him on the cheek. When Bart and Homer return home, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper is assumed by the rest of the family to be a Christmas present. Years later, the family would find breeder and trainer Les Moore and reunite their pet with his mother She-Biscuit.

In various episodes, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper can be seen chewing on newspapers and other objects in the Simpsons&#x27; household, destroying furniture, and digging holes in the backyard. In &quot;Bart&#x27;s Dog Gets an &quot;F&quot; (season two, 1991), he manages to infuriate the entire family by destroying valued items in the home. As a result, Homer and Marge want to get rid of the dog, but Bart and Lisa convince them that he can be trained at an obedience school. Santa&#x27;s Little Helper does not do well there as Bart is unwilling to use a choke chain suggested by the instructor. The night before the final exam, Bart and Santa&#x27;s Little Helper play, thinking it will be their last few hours together. This bonding breaks down the communication barrier, allowing the dog to understand Bart&#x27;s commands, and consequently pass the obedience school.

Santa&#x27;s Little Helper has fathered several puppies. In &quot;Two Dozen and One Greyhounds&quot; (season six, episode twenty, 1995), he runs away to the dog racing track where he mates with a female hound named She&#x27;s the Fastest. She later gives birth to 25 puppies and when the Simpsons cannot take care of them any longer, they decide to sell them; however, Mr. Burns steals the puppies and decides to make a tuxedo out of them. Before he does this, however, he becomes emotionally touched by them. This convinces him to never wear fur again and instead raise the puppies to be world-class racing dogs. Santa&#x27;s Little Helper sires another litter of puppies with Dr. Hibbert&#x27;s poodle in the episode &quot;Today I Am a Clown&quot; (season 15, 2003). These puppies are given away to townspeople.

The dog has been neglected or treated unfavorably by the family in some episodes. In &quot;Dog of Death&quot; (season three, 1992), he nearly dies of bloat and they decide to make budget cuts in order to pay for the required operation. Although the dog&#x27;s life is saved, the family begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices and starts treating him badly, causing him to run away. He ends up in the possession of Mr. Burns, who trains him to become a vicious attack dog. Several days later, Bart stumbles upon the trained Santa&#x27;s Little Helper and is attacked, but the greyhound eventually recognizes his old friend and stops. In &quot;The Canine Mutiny&quot; (season eight, 1997), Bart uses a fake charge card to buy a well-trained rough collie named Laddie from a mail-order catalog. Laddie learns many tricks that Santa&#x27;s Little Helper is completely unable to perform, and the Simpson family nearly forgets about their old pet. Bart eventually gives Santa&#x27;s Little Helper away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tries to get him back. When he finally finds him, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper is serving as a seeing-eye dog for a blind man, but eventually decides to return to the family.

In &quot;Stop or My Dog Will Shoot&quot; (season 18, 2007), Santa&#x27;s Little Helper becomes a local hero after finding a lost Homer, and the Simpsons decide to enroll him in the Animal Police Academy. However, his new crime-fighting job makes him jaded and one day at home he bites Bart. The Simpsons must therefore send the dog away to live with officer Lou. However, he gets to return after saving Bart from a toxic smoke cloud at school and then leaving the police force. In &quot;How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?&quot; (season 22, 2010), after Santa&#x27;s Little Helper devours a pigeon with a broken leg that Bart was nursing, Bart gets mad at the dog and is unable to forgive him. The Simpsons therefore give him away to an ostrich farm. There, Bart says goodbye to him and explains that he should never, ever devour a bird. Bart then gets into a fight with an angry ostrich. After remembering that he was told that it&#x27;s wrong to kill birds, he ceases to aid Bart in the fight, confused at his own loyalty (for Bart&#x27;s sake or his orders) leaving Bart to strangle the ostrich. Bart then realizes that he could not help killing the pigeon and apologizes. Afterwards, the family goes back home with the dog.

The dog once replaced Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer in the episode &quot;Old Yeller Belly&quot; (season 14, 2003), after he was seen drinking from a can of beer by balancing it on his nose. He becomes known as Suds McDuff and boosts sales of Duff Beer, making the family&#x27;s fortunes explode. However, this prompts his original sleazy owner and racing trainer to visit the Simpsons and prove that he&#x27;s the owner of the dog. The family later figures that if they can get Duffman to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, they can get their dog back. They plan to turn Duffman into a hero at a Duff Beer-sponsored beach volleyball event; however, their plan fails and a drunk shark that&#x27;s discovered at the event becomes the new mascot instead. Santa&#x27;s Little Helper gladly returns to the Simpson family.

==Creation and development==

Santa&#x27;s Little Helper&#x27;s initial appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was in the first episode of the series, &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, which aired on Dec. 17, 1989. Since then, he has become a recurring character. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening told &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 2000 that &quot;we [the staff] painted ourselves into a corner with our Christmas episode. Once we wrote the dog into the show, we were stuck with him.&quot; The name &quot;Santa&#x27;s Little Helper&quot; was chosen because, according to writer Al Jean in the same &quot;TV Guide&quot; article, &quot;we needed a name that would inspire Homer to bet on him, an omen, a Christmas name since he was betting on Christmas Eve. But, at that point, nobody was thinking long-term. We weren&#x27;t considering what might happen in ten years, when we&#x27;ve got to use this name.&quot; Although &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; was the first episode of the series to air on TV, it was the eighth episode produced by the staff. It was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with the others. Jean told the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; in 2001 that after the first episode was broadcast and &quot;the next seven didn&#x27;t have the dog, people wondered why.&quot; He also said in 2003 that the staff enjoyed the first episodes that centered on him, particularly &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, which is the reason that more episodes about him were written.

Writer John Swartzwelder has noted that the staff members of the show write the character Homer in the same way that they write Santa&#x27;s Little Helper: &quot;Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food.&quot; Although animals in cartoons often behave with &quot;semi-human awareness&quot;, Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode &quot;Two Dozen and One Greyhounds&quot; that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly the way they do in real life. As a result, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show. There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, but most of the time the staff of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; tries to keep animals acting realistically. Several journalists have commented on the greyhound&#x27;s lack of intelligence. In an article that compared &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, Todd Camp of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; noted that &quot;though Santa&#x27;s Little Helper may be the only Simpson who&#x27;s dumber than Homer, the Griffins&#x27; pooch [Brian Griffin] is the brainiest member of the household&quot;. In 1991, Copley News Service&#x27;s Alison Ashton described Santa&#x27;s Little Helper as a &quot;sweet and stupid dog&quot;. Tom Coombe of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; wrote in 2002 that &quot;fans of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; will tell you that the cartoon family&#x27;s dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish. Fans of the real-life breed will paint a different picture — of dogs that are peaceful, affectionate, [and] not given to drooling, panting&quot;.

Some ideas for episodes featuring Santa&#x27;s Little Helper come from reality. The plot of &quot;Dog of Death&quot; was based on Swartzwelder&#x27;s experiences with his own dog, which had also suffered from bloat. However, unlike the events in the episode, Swartzwelder&#x27;s dog did not receive treatment as the operation was too expensive and the dog was too old. &quot;The Gold Coast Bulletin&quot;″s Ryan Ellem commented in 2005 that the Simpson family&#x27;s dilemma with the cost of the veterinary procedure is a realistic dilemma faced by many families who own dogs. Other episode ideas come from popular culture. For example, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper fathering 25 puppies in &quot;Two Dozen and One Greyhounds&quot; is a parody of the Disney film &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, and Mr. Burns&#x27; technique of brainwashing him into an attack dog in &quot;Dog of Death&quot; parodies &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Susan McHugh, who teaches theories of animals, literature, and culture at the University of New England, wrote in her 2004 book &quot;Dog&quot; that, &quot;remaining loyal to his unlikely saviours, the boy Bart and his father Homer, this greyhound has prompted satires of contemporary dog culture, from Barbara Woodhouse&#x27;s authoritarian training methods [in &quot;Bart&#x27;s Dog Gets an &#x27;F] to Lassie&#x27;s flawless service to the status quo [in &quot;The Canine Mutiny&quot;].&quot;

===Sounds===

Although cast member Dan Castellaneta occasionally voiced Santa&#x27;s Little Helper for bit parts, American voice artist Frank Welker most often provided the sounds of the dog and other animals on the show from &quot;Bart&#x27;s Dog Gets an &#x27;F, which aired on March 7, 1991, to &quot;Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily&quot;, which aired on October 1, 1995. He said on his official website in 2007 that he liked portraying Santa&#x27;s Little Helper because the dog was a &quot;sympathetic&quot; character. Welker has been praised by staff members for his performances on the show. David Mirkin has noted that &quot;he can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you&#x27;re listening to a guy, and he&#x27;s a pleasure to work with.&quot; Groening has commented that he was &quot;unbelievably good&quot; at doing animal noises. After 1995, Castellaneta voiced Santa&#x27;s Little Helper on his own while Welker performed other animal noises until his full departure in 2002, when he was denied a pay raise. In the &quot;questions and answers&quot; section on his website, Welker revealed that the reason he stopped performing as Santa&#x27;s Little Helper was because &quot;The producers thought... &#x27;Hmmm, Dan barks pretty good, and we are already paying him and he seems to like doing the dog thing... why do we need to pay Welker who comes in here, spends less than an hour, eats all the doughnuts, refuses to come to rehearsals... let&#x27;s just give the damn dog to Dan!&#x27;&quot;

==Reception==
Santa&#x27;s Little Helper has become a well-known dog because of his appearances in the series. A writer for &quot;The Grand Rapids Press&quot; wrote in 2002 that &quot;we all know who Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie are—heck, most Americans probably recognize their pets, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper and Snowball II&quot;. McHugh wrote in &quot;Dog&quot; that while Master McGrath was the most famous greyhound of the 19th century, &quot;the most popular greyhound a hundred years later&quot; is Santa&#x27;s Little Helper. In the television special &quot;50 Greatest TV Animals&quot; that was hosted by Mario Lopez and aired on Animal Planet in 2003, the dog ranked 27th. Other dogs featured on the list were Lassie (first), Eddie (fifth), Snoopy (sixth), Scooby-Doo (13th), Rin Tin Tin (14th), Max (20th), Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (24th), Buck (29th), Chipper (44th), and Tiger (50th). According to a writer for McClatchy News Service, the rankings were &quot;determined by popularity, name recognition and how long the show lasted.&quot;

Among fans and critics, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper has been mostly well received. He ranked seventh in a 2008 poll by &quot;Dog Whisperer&quot;″s Cesar Millan that determined the &quot;best-loved television dog of all time.&quot; Lassie ranked first in the poll. In addition, he was voted the tenth favorite &quot;Simpsons&quot; character by readers of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot; in the United Kingdom in 2010. In a list of their top twelve favorite dogs from cartoons, comics, and animation, writers for &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; listed Santa&#x27;s Little Helper at number six, writing: &quot;We admire his upbeat nature even after having his legs broken by Mr. Burns and being abandoned by Bart for another dog, Laddie.&quot; He also ranked 75th on Retrocrush author Robert Berry&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Dogs of Pop Culture History&quot; in 2006. The character has attracted some criticism too, though. While reviewing the episode &quot;Bart&#x27;s Dog Gets an &#x27;F in 2010, Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote:

&quot;As cartoon dogs go, Santa’s Little Helper is spectacularly unspectacular. In a realm of aggressively anthropomorphic canines, some of whom, admittedly, have strong speech impediments, he doesn’t talk or wisecrack or engage in shenanigans. His abilities and powers begin and end with masticating, defecating, and regular napping. You know, just like a real dog. Consequently, episodes devoted to Santa’s Little Helper tend to be a little on the sleepy side, even the &quot;Simpsons&quot; Christmas special that launched the series.&quot;

In 2022, &quot;Yard Barker&quot; named Santa&#x27;s Little Helper as 12th most memorable TV pets.

==Influence==
Since his first appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper has appeared in merchandise relating to the show. On the board art of &quot;The Simpsons Clue&quot;, a 2000 board game by USAopoly based on &quot;Clue&quot;, he is shown drinking Duff Beer that has been spilled on the floor. In another board game published by USAopoly called &quot;The Simpsons Monopoly&quot;, based on &quot;Monopoly&quot; and released in 2001, the dog is featured as one of the six pewter playing pieces. Santa&#x27;s Little Helper has also appeared in issues of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, in the 2007 film &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, and in video games based on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; such as &quot;Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;. In addition, the dog has been made into action figures by McFarlane Toys, action figures by Playmates Toys in the World of Springfield series, and plush toys. In the Springfield section surrounding The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood, one carnival game is themed as &quot;Help Santa&#x27;s Little Helper&quot;.

Santa&#x27;s Little Helper has made an impact on real life in that an espresso-based drink has been named after him at the award-winning restaurant and bar Bambara in Salt Lake City&#x27;s Hotel Monaco. Bartender Ethan Moore told &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; in 2004 that it is &quot;one of the most popular holiday drinks&quot; at Bambara. In addition, a dog walking and pet sitting company in New York City, called &quot;Santa&#x27;s Little Helper Dog Walking and Pet Sitting&quot;, has been named after him. The greyhound has also appeared by himself on the cover of the issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;. This issue was released with 24 different covers, all featuring different characters from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

<text>The Danelaw (, ; ; ) was the part of England between the early tenth century and the Norman Conquest under Anglo-Saxon rule in which Danish laws applied. The Danelaw originated in the conquest and occupation of large parts of eastern and northern England by Danish Vikings in the late ninth century. The term applies to the areas in which English kings allowed the Danes to keep their own laws following the tenth-century English conquest in return for the Danish settlers&#x27; loyalty to the English crown. &quot;Danelaw&quot; is first recorded in the early 11th century as &quot;Dena lage&quot;. 

The Danelaw originated from the invasion of the Great Heathen Army into England in 865, but the term was not used to describe a geographic area until the 11th century. With the increase in population and productivity in Scandinavia, Viking warriors, having sought treasure and glory in the nearby British Isles, &quot;proceeded to plough and support themselves&quot;, in the words of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for 876.

Danelaw can describe the set of legal terms and definitions created in the treaties between Alfred the Great, the king of Wessex, and Guthrum, the Danish warlord, written following Guthrum&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Edington in 878.

In 886, the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum was formalised, defining the boundaries of their kingdoms, with provisions for peaceful relations between the English and the Vikings. The language spoken in England was affected by this clash of cultures, with the emergence of Anglo-Norse dialects.

The Danelaw approximately covered Yorkshire, East Anglia, and the central and eastern Midlands.

==Background==
===Scandinavian York===

From around 800, there had been waves of Norse raids on the coastlines of Britain and Ireland. In 865, instead of raiding, the Danes landed a large army in East Anglia, with the intention of conquering the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England. The armies of various Danish leaders had collaborated to make one combined force under a leadership that included Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, the sons of the legendary Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok. The combined army was described in the annals as the Great Heathen Army. After making peace with the local East Anglian king in return for horses, the Great Heathen Army moved north. In 867 they captured Northumbria and its capital, York (&quot;Jórvík&quot;), defeating both the recently deposed King Osberht of Northumbria and the usurper Ælla of Northumbria. The Danes then placed an Englishman, Ecgberht I of Northumbria, on the throne of Northumbria as a puppet ruler.

King Æthelred of Wessex and his brother, Alfred, led their army against the Danes at Nottingham, but the Danes refused to leave their fortifications. King Burgred of Mercia negotiated peace with Ivar, with the Danes keeping Nottingham in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia alone.

Under Ivar the Boneless, the Danes continued their invasion in 869 by defeating King Edmund of East Anglia at Hoxne and conquering East Anglia. Once again, the brothers Æthelred and Alfred attempted to stop Ivar by attacking the Danes at Reading. They were repelled with heavy losses. The Danes pursued, and on 7 January 871, Æthelred and Alfred defeated the Danes at the Battle of Ashdown. The Danes retreated to Basing (in Hampshire), where Æthelred attacked and was, in turn, defeated. Ivar was able to follow up this victory with another in March at Meretum (now Marton, Wiltshire).

On 23 April 871, King Æthelred died and Alfred succeeded him as King of Wessex. His army was weak and he was forced to pay tribute to Ivar in order to make peace with the Danes. During this peace, the Danes turned to the north and attacked Mercia, a campaign that lasted until 874. The Danish leader Ivar died during this campaign. Ivar was succeeded by Guthrum, who finished the campaign against Mercia. In ten years, the Danes had gained control over East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, leaving just Wessex resisting.

Guthrum and the Danes brokered peace with Wessex in 876, when they captured the fortresses of Wareham and Exeter. Alfred laid siege to the Danes, who were forced to surrender after reinforcements were lost in a storm. Two years later, Guthrum again attacked Alfred, surprising him by attacking his forces wintering in Chippenham. King Alfred was saved when the Danish army coming from his rear was destroyed by inferior forces at the Battle of Cynuit. The modern location of &quot;Cynuit&quot; is disputed but suggestions include Countisbury Hill, near Lynmouth, Devon, or Kenwith Castle, Bideford, Devon, or Cannington, near Bridgwater, Somerset. Alfred was forced into hiding for a time, before returning in early 878 to gather an army and attack Guthrum at Edington. The Danes were defeated and retreated to Chippenham, where King Alfred laid siege and soon forced them to surrender. As a term of surrender, King Alfred demanded that Guthrum be baptised a Christian; King Alfred served as his godfather.

Edward the Elder and his sister, Æthelflæd, the Lady of the Mercians, conquered Danish territories in the Midlands and East Anglia in a series of campaigns in the 910s, and some Danish jarls who submitted were allowed to keep their lands. Viking rule ended when Eric Bloodaxe was driven out of Northumbria in 954.

The reasons for the waves of immigration were complex and bound to the political situation in Scandinavia at that time; they occurred when Viking settlers were also establishing their presence in the Hebrides, Isle of Man, Orkney, Shetland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, France (Normandy), the Baltics, Russia and Ukraine (see Kievan Rus&#x27;).

==Cnut and his successors==

The Danes did not give up their designs on England. From 1016 to 1035, Cnut the Great ruled over a unified English kingdom, itself the product of a resurgent Wessex, as part of his North Sea Empire, together with Denmark, Norway and part of Sweden. Cnut was succeeded in England on his death by his son Harold Harefoot, until he died in 1040, after which another of Cnut&#x27;s sons, Harthacnut, took the throne. Since Harthacnut was already on the Danish throne, this reunited the North Sea Empire. Harthacnut lived only another two years, and from his death in 1042 until 1066 the monarchy reverted to the English line in the form of Edward the Confessor.

Edward died in January 1066 without an obvious successor, and an English nobleman, Harold Godwinson, took the throne. Later that year, two rival claimants to the throne led invasions of England in short succession. First, Harald Hardrada of Norway took York in September, but was defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, in Yorkshire. Then, three weeks later, William of Normandy defeated Harold at the Battle of Hastings, in Sussex, and in December he accepted the submission of Edgar the Ætheling, last in the line of Anglo-Saxon royal succession, at Berkhamsted.

The Danelaw appeared in legislation as late as the early 12th century with the &quot;Leges Henrici Primi&quot;, where it is referred to as one of the laws together with those of Wessex and Mercia into which England was divided.

==Chronology==
793 − Viking raid on Lindisfarne

800 − Waves of Danish assaults on the coastlines of the British Isles.

865 − Danish raiders first began to settle in England. Led by the brothers Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless, they wintered in East Anglia, where they demanded and received tribute in exchange for a temporary peace. From there, they moved north and attacked Northumbria, which was in the midst of a civil war between the deposed king Osberht and a usurper Ælla. The Danes used the civil turmoil as an opportunity to capture York, which they sacked and burned.

867 − Following the loss of York, Osberht and Ælla formed an alliance against the Danes. They launched a counter-attack, but the Danes killed both Osberht and Ælla and set up a puppet king on the Northumbrian throne. In response, King Æthelred of Wessex, along with his brother Alfred, marched against the Danes, who were positioned behind fortifications in Nottingham, but were unable to draw them into battle. In order to effect peace, King Burgred of Mercia ceded Nottingham to the Danes in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia undisturbed.

868 − Danes captured Nottingham.

869 − Ivar the Boneless returned and demanded tribute from King Edmund of East Anglia.

870 − King Edmund refused Ivar&#x27;s demand. Ivar defeated and captured Edmund at Hoxne, adding East Anglia to the area controlled by the invading Danes. King Æthelred and Alfred attacked the Danes at Reading, but were repulsed with heavy losses. The Danes pursued them.

871 − On 7 January, Æthelred and Alfred made their stand at Ashdown (on what is the Berkshire/North Wessex Downs now in Oxfordshire). Æthelred could not be found at the start of battle, as he was busy praying in his tent, so Alfred led the army into battle. Æthelred and Alfred defeated the Danes, who counted among their losses five jarls (nobles). The Danes retreated and set up fortifications at Basing (Basingstoke) in Hampshire, a mere from Reading. Æthelred attacked the Danish fortifications and was routed. The Danes followed up with another victory in March at Meretum (now Marton, Wiltshire).

King Æthelred died on 23 April 871 and Alfred took the throne of Wessex. For the rest of the year Alfred concentrated on attacking with small bands against isolated groups of Danes. He was moderately successful in this endeavour and was able to score minor victories against the Danes, but his army was on the verge of collapse. Alfred responded by paying off the Danes for a promise of peace. During the peace, the Danes turned north and attacked Mercia, which they finished off in short order, and captured London in the process. King Burgred of Mercia fought in vain against Ivar the Boneless and his Danish invaders for three years until 874, when he fled to Europe. During Ivar&#x27;s campaign against Mercia, he died and was succeeded by Guthrum the Old. Guthrum quickly defeated Burgred and placed a puppet on the throne of Mercia. The Danes now controlled East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, with only Wessex continuing to resist.

875 − The Danes settled in Dorset, well inside Alfred&#x27;s Kingdom of Wessex, but Alfred quickly made peace with them.

876 − The Danes broke the peace when they captured the fortress of Wareham, followed by a similar capture of Exeter in 877.

877 − Alfred laid in a siege, while the Danes waited for reinforcements from Scandinavia. Unfortunately for the Danes, the fleet of reinforcements encountered a storm and lost more than 100 ships, and the Danes were forced to return to East Mercia in the north.

878 − In January, Guthrum led an attack against Wessex that sought to capture Alfred while he wintered in Chippenham. Another Danish army landed in south Wales arrived and moved south with the intent of intercepting Alfred should he flee from Guthrum&#x27;s forces. However, they stopped during their march to capture a small fortress at Countisbury Hill, held by a Wessex ealdorman named Odda. The Saxons, led by Odda, attacked the Danes while they slept and defeated their superior forces, saving Alfred from being trapped between the two armies. Alfred was forced to go into hiding for the rest of the winter and spring of 878 in the Somerset marshes in order to avoid the superior Danish forces. In the spring, Alfred was able to gather an army and attacked Guthrum and the Danes at Edington. The Danes were defeated and retreated to Chippenham, where the English pursued and laid siege to Guthrum&#x27;s forces. The Danes were unable to hold out without relief and soon surrendered. Alfred demanded, as a term of the surrender, that Guthrum become baptised as a Christian, which Guthrum agreed to do, with Alfred acting as his godfather. Guthrum was true to his word and settled in East Anglia, at least for a while.

884 − Guthrum attacked Kent, but was defeated by the English. This led to the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, which established the boundaries of the Danelaw and allowed for Danish self-rule in the region.

902 − Essex submitted to Æthelwald.

903 − Æthelwald incited the East Anglian Danes into breaking the peace. They ravaged Mercia before winning a pyrrhic victory that saw the death of Æthelwald and the Danish King Eohric; this allowed Edward the Elder to consolidate power.

911 − The English defeated the Danes at the Battle of Tettenhall. The Northumbrians ravaged Mercia but were trapped by Edward and forced to fight.

917 − In return for peace and protection, the Kingdoms of Essex and East Anglia accepted Edward the Elder as their suzerain overlord.

Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, took the borough of Derby.

918 − The borough of Leicester submitted peaceably to Æthelflæd&#x27;s rule. The people of York promised to accept her as their overlord, but she died before this could come to fruition. She was succeeded by her brother, the Kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex united in the person of King Edward.

919 − Norwegian Vikings under King Ragnvald Sygtryggsson of Dublin took York.

920 − Edward was accepted as father and lord by the King of the Scots, by Rægnold, the sons of Eadulf, the English, Norwegians, Danes and others all of whom dwelt in Northumbria and the King and people of the Strathclyde Welsh.

954 − King Eric was driven out of Northumbria, his death marking the end of the prospect of a Northern Viking Kingdom stretching from York to Dublin and the Isles.

1002 – St. Brice&#x27;s Day massacre of the Danes

1066 − Harald Hardrada landed with an army, hoping to take control of York and the English crown. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. This event is often cited as the end of the Viking era. The same year, William the Conqueror, himself a descendant of Vikings, successfully took the English throne and became the first Norman king of England.

1069 − Sweyn II of Denmark landed with an army, in much the same way as Harald Hardrada. He took control of York after defeating the Norman garrison and inciting a local uprising. King William eventually defeated his forces and devastated the region in the Harrying of the North.

1075 − One of Sweyn&#x27;s sons, Cnut, set sail for England to support an English rebellion, but it had been crushed before he arrived, so he settled for plundering the city of York and surrounding area, before returning home.

1085 − Cnut, now king, assembled a fleet for a major invasion against England. Informed of his planned crossing, William hurried back to England to prepare a defence, but internal threats forced Cnut to cancel his plan. Other than Eystein II of Norway taking advantage of the civil war during Stephen&#x27;s reign, to plunder the east coast of England, there were no serious invasions or raids of England by the Danes after this.

==Geography==
The area occupied by the Danelaw was roughly the area to the north of a line drawn between London and Chester, excluding the portion of Northumbria to the east of the Pennines. 

Five fortified towns became particularly important in the Danelaw: Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Stamford and Lincoln, broadly delineating the area now called the East Midlands. These strongholds became known as the &quot;Five Boroughs&quot;. &quot;Borough&quot; derives from the Old English word (cognate with German , meaning castle), meaning a fortified and walled enclosure containing several households, anything from a large stockade to a fortified town. The meaning has since developed further.

==Legal concepts==
The Danelaw was an important factor in the establishment of a civilian peace in the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon and Viking communities. It established, for example, equivalences in areas of legal contentiousness, such as the amount of reparation that should be payable in &quot;wergild&quot;.

Many of the legalistic concepts were compatible; for example, the Viking &quot;wapentake&quot;, the standard for land division in the Danelaw, was effectively interchangeable with the hundred. The use of the execution site and cemetery at Walkington Wold in east Yorkshire suggests a continuity of judicial practice.

Under the Danelaw, between 30% and 50% of the population in the countryside had the legal status of &#x27;sokeman&#x27;, occupying an intermediate position between the free tenants and the bond tenants. This tended to provide more autonomy for the peasants. A sokeman was a free man within the lord&#x27;s &quot;soke&quot;, or jurisdiction.

According to many scholars, &quot;... the Danelaw was an especially ‘free’ area of Britain because the rank and file of the Danish armies, from whom sokemen were descended, had settled in the area and imported their own social system.&quot;

==Legacy==

The influence of this period of Scandinavian settlement can still be seen in the North of England and the East Midlands, and is particularly evident in place-names, endings such as &quot;-howe&quot;, &quot;-by&quot; (meaning &quot;village&quot;) or &quot;-thorp&quot; (&quot;hamlet&quot;) having Old Norse origins. There seems to be a remarkable number of &quot;Kirby/Kirkby&quot; names, thought to stem from Old Norse &quot;kirk&quot; (&quot;church&quot;, compare for church) and -&quot;by&quot; (&quot;village&quot;), some with remains of Anglo-Saxon buildings, indicating both a Norse origin and early church building.

Old East Norse and Old English were still somewhat mutually comprehensible. The contact between these languages in the Danelaw caused the incorporation of many Norse words into the English language, including the word law itself, &quot;sky&quot; and &quot;window,&quot; and the third person pronouns &quot;they&quot;, &quot;them&quot; and &quot;their&quot;. Many Old Norse words still survive in the dialects of Northern England.

Four of the five boroughs became county towns—of the counties of Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Stamford failed to gain such status—perhaps because of the nearby autonomous territory of Rutland.

==Genetic heritage==

In 2000, the BBC commissioned a genetic survey of the British Isles by a team from University College London led by Professor David Goldstein for its programme &#x27;Blood of the Vikings&#x27;. It concluded that Norse (Norwegian) invaders settled sporadically throughout the British Isles with a particular concentration in certain areas, such as Orkney and Shetland. The study did not set out to genetically distinguish descendants of Danish Vikings from descendants of Anglo-Saxon settlers. That was decided on the basis that the latter two groups originated from areas that overlap each other on the continental North Sea coast (ranging from the Jutland Peninsula to Belgium) and were therefore considered too difficult to genetically distinguish. A 10-year genetic study published in 2020 found evidence of a major influx of Danish settlers into England during the Viking period.

==Archaeology==
Major archaeological sites that bear testimony to the Danelaw are few. The most famous is the site at York. Another Danelaw site is the cremation site at Heath Wood, Ingleby, Derbyshire.

Archaeological sites do not bear out the historically defined area as being a real demographic or trade boundary. This could be due to misallocation of the items and features on which this judgement is based as being indicative of either Anglo-Saxon or Norse presence. Otherwise, it could indicate that there was considerable population movement between the areas, or simply that after the treaty was made, it was ignored by one or both sides.

Thynghowe was an important Danelaw meeting place, today located in Sherwood Forest, in Nottinghamshire. The word &quot;howe&quot; often indicates a prehistoric burial mound. Howe is derived from the Old Norse word meaning mound. The site&#x27;s rediscovery was made by Lynda Mallett, Stuart Reddish and John Wood. The site had vanished from modern maps and was essentially lost to history until the local history enthusiasts made their discoveries. Experts think the rediscovered site, which lies amidst the old oaks of an area known as the Birklands in Sherwood Forest, may also yield clues as to the boundary of the ancient Anglo Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. English Heritage recently inspected the site and believes it is a national rarity. Thynghowe was a place where people came to resolve disputes and settle issues. It is a Norse word, although the site may be older still, perhaps even from the Bronze Age.

<doc id="64951" wikidata="Q23220" url="?curid=64951" title="Berkshire">
<text>Berkshire ( ; abbreviated ), officially the Royal County of Berkshire, is a ceremonial county in South East England. It is bordered by Oxfordshire to the north, Buckinghamshire to the north-east, Greater London to the east, Surrey to the south-east, Hampshire to the south, and Wiltshire to the west. Reading is the largest settlement and the county town.

The county has an area of and a population of 911,403. The population is concentrated in the east, the area closest to Greater London, which includes the county&#x27;s largest towns: Reading (174,224), Slough (164,793), Bracknell (113,205), and Maidenhead (70,374). The west is rural, and its largest town is Newbury (33,841). For local government purposes Berkshire comprises six unitary authority areas: Bracknell Forest, Reading, Slough, West Berkshire, Windsor and Maidenhead, and Wokingham. The historic county included the parts of Oxfordshire south of the River Thames, which formed its northern border, but excluded Caversham and Slough.

The Berkshire Downs, a chalk downland and area of outstanding natural beauty, occupy the west of the county. They are the source of the River Kennet, which flows east through Newbury before meeting the Thames at Reading. The Thames then forms Berkshire&#x27;s northern border, flowing past Maidenhead, before entering the county and flowing past Slough and Windsor. The south-east of the county contains Swinley Forest, a remnant of Windsor Forest now used as a forestry plantation.

There is evidence of prehistoric settlement on the Berkshire Downs, including the Iron Age Uffington White Horse, now in Oxfordshire. In the Anglo-Saxon period the region was contested by Mercia and Wessex, and Alfred the Great was born in Wantage, also now in Oxfordshire. Windsor Castle, which would become the official country residence of the British monarch, was built after the Norman Conquest. The county has been the site of several battles, particularly during the First English Civil War, when Reading and Wallingford were besieged two battles took place at Newbury, in 1643 and 1644. The proximity of the east of the county to London led to development from the nineteenth century, when Slough became an industrial centre and Bracknell was designated a new town. Software development and high-tech industry dominate the economy in the east, but the west remains an agricultural region.

==History==
According to Asser&#x27;s biography of King Alfred, written in 893 AD, Berkshire takes its name from a wood of box trees, which was called &quot;Bearroc&quot; (a Celtic word meaning &quot;hilly&quot;). This wood, perhaps no longer extant, was west of Frilsham, near Newbury.

Much of the county&#x27;s early history is recorded in the &quot;Chronicles&quot; of the Abingdon Abbey, which at the time of the survey was second only to the crown in the extent and number of its possessions, such as The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay. The abbot exercised considerable judicial and administrative powers, and his court was endowed with the privileges of the hundred court and freed from liability to interference by the sheriff. Berkshire and Oxfordshire had a common sheriff until the reign of Elizabeth I, and the shire court was held at Grandpont. The assizes were formerly held at Reading, Abingdon, and Newbury, but by 1911 were held entirely at Reading.

Berkshire has been the scene of notable battles. Alfred the Great&#x27;s campaign against the Danes included the battles of Englefield, Ashdown and Reading. Newbury was the site of English Civil War battles: the First Battle of Newbury, at Wash Common in 1643, and the Second Battle of Newbury, at Speen in 1644. Donnington Castle was reduced to a ruin in the aftermath of the second battle. Another Battle of Reading took place on 9 December 1688. It was the only substantial military action in England during the Glorious Revolution and ended in a decisive victory for forces loyal to William of Orange.

Reading became the new county town in 1867, taking over from Abingdon, which remained in the county. Under the Local Government Act 1888, Berkshire County Council took over functions of the Berkshire Quarter Sessions, covering the administrative county of Berkshire, which excluded the county borough of Reading. Boundary alterations in the late 19th century and early 20th century were relatively rare, but included ceding the parts of the borough of Oxford south of the Thames in 1889, and gaining Caversham from Oxfordshire in 1911. The administrative county&#x27;s full legal name was &quot;Berks&quot; rather than &quot;Berkshire&quot; until 1967, when the government changed the name to Berkshire at the county council&#x27;s request.

Berkshire received the title &quot;Royal County&quot; in 1957 due to the presence of Windsor Castle. The area has historical ties to royalty dating back to the Norman Conquest, when William the Conqueror established Windsor as a royal residence. On 1 April 1974, Berkshire&#x27;s boundaries changed under the Local Government Act 1972. Berkshire took over administration of Slough and Eton and part of the former Eton Rural District from Buckinghamshire. The northern part of the county came under governance of Oxfordshire, with Faringdon, Wantage and Abingdon and their hinterland becoming the Vale of White Horse district, and Didcot and Wallingford added to South Oxfordshire district. 94 (Berkshire Yeomanry) Signal Squadron still keep the Uffington White Horse in their insignia, even though the White Horse is now within the ceremonial county of Oxfordshire. The original Local Government White Paper would have transferred Henley-on-Thames from Oxfordshire to Berkshire: this proposal did not make it into the Bill as introduced.

On 1 April 1998 Berkshire County Council was abolished under a recommendation of the Banham Commission, and the districts became unitary authorities. Unlike similar reforms elsewhere at the same time, the non-metropolitan county was not abolished. Signs saying &quot;Welcome to the Royal County of Berkshire&quot; exist on borders of West Berkshire, on the east side of Virginia Water, on the M4 motorway, on the south side of Sonning Bridge, on the A404 southbound by Marlow, and northbound on the A33 past Stratfield Saye.

A flag for the historic county of Berkshire was registered with the Flag Institute in 2017.

==Geography==

All of the county is drained by the Thames. Berkshire divides into two topological (and associated geological) sections: east and west of Reading. North-east Berkshire has the low calciferous (limestone) m-shaped bends of the Thames south of which is a broader, clayey, gravelly former watery plain or belt from Earley to Windsor and beyond, south, are parcels and belts of uneroded higher sands, flints, shingles and lightly acid soil and in the north of the Bagshot Formation, north of Surrey and Hampshire. Swinley Forest (also known as Bracknell Forest), Windsor Great Park, Crowthorne and Stratfield Saye Woods have many pine, silver birch, and other lightly acid-soil trees. East of the grassy and wooded bends a large minority of East Berkshire&#x27;s land mirrors the clay belt, being of low elevation and on the left (north) bank of the Thames: Slough, Eton, Eton Wick, Wraysbury, Horton, and Datchet. In the heart of the county Reading&#x27;s northern suburb Caversham is also on that bank, but rises steeply into the Chiltern Hills.

Two main tributaries skirt past Reading, the Loddon and its sub-tributary the Blackwater draining parts of two counties south, and the Kennet draining part of upland Wiltshire in the west. Heading west the reduced, but equally large, part of the county extends further from the Thames which flows from the north-north-west before the Goring Gap; West Berkshire hosts the varying-width plain of the River Kennet rising to high chalk hills by way of and lower clay slopes and rises. To the south, the land crests along the boundary with Hampshire; the highest parts of South-East and Eastern England taken together are here. The highest is Walbury Hill at . To the north of the Kennet are the Berkshire Downs. This is hilly country, with smaller and well-wooded valleys: those of the Lambourn, Pang, and their Thames sub-tributaries. The open upland areas vie with Newmarket, Suffolk for horse racing training and breeding centres and have good fields of barley, wheat, and other cereal crops.

==Geology==
Berkshire’s surface can be divided into three bands: the county&#x27;s downlands, south and east of which the London Clay spans almost the whole county, and in the south-east corner sandy Palaeogene heath covers the London Clay. This is an oversimplification, however.

A gently folded succession of sedimentary rocks dating from the Cretaceous period, with some surviving Palaeogene cover and extensive Quaternary deposits, characterise the downlands, which cover the area to the west of Reading and the western edge of the Chiltern Hills. The lower (early) Cretaceous rocks are sandstones and mudstones (now visible only on the slopes of Walbury Hill) whilst those of the upper (late) Cretaceous are the various formations that comprise the Chalk Group. In Berkshire, White Chalk Formation beds tend to be shallower than those further west (Wiltshire) or those in the Chilterns, and often contain layers of chalk rock. Less consolidated Palaeogene clays, sands, gravels and silts of the Lambeth, Thames and Bracklesham Groups overlie these rocks in some areas. These hills, and the valleys that surround them, were shaped by the rivers Kennet, Lambourn, Pang and Enborne, and the Quaternary sands and gravels they brought with them and (in the case of the Kennet) left behind when they changed course.

The early Eocene London Clay (Thames Group) generally gets thinner as we proceed westwards, though the thickness of beds can vary considerably over short distances. Where rivers have cut through these beds Lambeth Group layers are found (notably, the Palaeocene Reading Formation, used for brick-making since Roman times but now increasingly scarce in the area after which it was named).

The heaths and woodland south and east of Bracknell are mostly covered by (Eocene) Bracklesham Group sands and clays, and Quaternary sands, silts and gravels. After the Thames broke through the Goring Gap that river and its tributaries the Loddon, Emm Brook, Blackwater and (to some extent) Wey shaped the geography of eastern Berkshire but have not yet eroded away its Eocene cover.

==Demography==
According to 2003 estimates there were 803,657 people in Berkshire, or 636 people/km2. The population is mostly based in the urban areas to the east and centre of the county: the largest towns here are Reading, Slough, Bracknell, Maidenhead, Woodley, Wokingham, Windsor, Earley, Sandhurst, and Crowthorne. West Berkshire is much more rural and sparsely populated, with far fewer towns: the largest are Newbury, Thatcham, and Hungerford. In recent years, Berkshire has seen consistent population growth, particularly in urban areas like Reading and Slough. Between 2011-21, the population increased by 6.7%, largely due to migration and economic opportunities in the region. Reading has experienced significant growth due to its reputation as a technology and business hub.

In 1831, there were 146,234 people living in Berkshire; by 1901 the population had risen to 252,571 (of whom 122,807 were male and 129,764 were female). Below were the largest immigrant groups in 2011.
==Governance==
Berkshire is a ceremonial county and non-metropolitan county. It is divided into six districts administered by unitary authorities. Berkshire County Council existed from 1889 until its abolition in 1998. The ceremonial county has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff. The Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire is Andrew Try, and the High Sheriff of Berkshire for 2018/19 was Graham Barker.

The six unitary councils formed a joint Berkshire Prosperity Board in February 2024 and submitted an expression of interest in forming a non-mayoral combined authority in September 2024.

===Local===
As of the 2023 local elections, Liberal Democrat groups of local councillors run the unitary authorities of West Berkshire, Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham (in coalition with the Labour Party) with employed executives, whereas Labour Party local councillors run both Bracknell Forest and Reading, with Slough being run by the Conservative Party.

===Parliament===

After the 2024 United Kingdom general election, 5 of the elected Members of Parliament (MPs) were Labour, 3 Lib Dem and one conservative.

The prime minister between 2016–19, Theresa May represented Maidenhead.

===Industry===

Reading has a historical involvement in the information technology industry, largely as a result of the early presence in the town of sites of International Computers Limited and Digital. These companies have been swallowed by other groups, but their descendants, Fujitsu and Hewlett-Packard respectively, still have local operations. More recently Microsoft and Oracle have established multi-building campuses on the outskirts of Reading. Other technology companies with a presence in the town include Huawei Technologies, Agilent Technologies, Audio &amp; Design (Recording) Ltd, Bang &amp; Olufsen, Cisco, Comptel, Ericsson, Harris Corporation, Intel, Nvidia, Rockwell Collins, Sage, SGI, Symantec, Symbol Technologies, Verizon Business, Virgin Media O2, Websense, Xansa (now Sopra Steria), and Xerox. The financial company ING Direct has its headquarters in Reading, as does the directories company Hibu. The insurance company Prudential has an administration centre in the town. PepsiCo and Holiday Inn have offices. As with most major cities, Reading also has offices of the Big Four accounting firms Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The 110-year old charity, Berkshire Vision is also located within Reading city centre.

The global headquarters of Reckitt Benckiser and the UK headquarters of Mars, Incorporated are based in Slough. The European head offices of major IT companies BlackBerry, CA Technologies, are in the town. The town is home to the National Foundation for Educational Research, which is housed in The Mere. Other major brands with offices in the town include Nintendo, Black &amp; Decker, Amazon, HTC, SSE plc and Abbey Business Centres. Dulux paints were manufactured in Slough by AkzoNobel, which bought Imperial Chemical Industries in 2008. Manufacturing ceased in 2018 with operations moving elsewhere, however the UK headquarters is still based there.

Bracknell is a base for high-tech industries, with the presence of companies such as Panasonic, Fujitsu (formerly ICL) and Fujitsu-Siemens Computers, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens (originally Nixdorf), Honeywell, Cable &amp; Wireless, Avnet Technology Solutions and Novell. Firms spread into the surrounding Thames Valley or M4 corridor, attracting IT firms such as Cable &amp; Wireless, DEC (subsequently Hewlett-Packard), Microsoft, Sharp Telecommunications, Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems and Cognos. Bracknell is home to the central Waitrose distribution centre and head office, which is on a site on the Southern Industrial Estate. Waitrose has operated from the town since the 1970s.

==Sport==

===Horse racing===

Berkshire hosts more Group 1 flat horse races than any other county. Ascot Racecourse is used for thoroughbred horse racing. It is one of the leading racecourses in the United Kingdom, hosting 13 of the UK&#x27;s 35 annual Group 1 races. The course is closely associated with the British Royal Family, being approximately from Windsor Castle, and owned by the Crown Estate.

Ascot today stages twenty-five days of racing over the course of the year, comprising sixteen flat meetings held between May and October. The Royal Meeting, held in June, remains a major draw; the highlight is the Ascot Gold Cup. The most prestigious race is the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes run in July.

Newbury Racecourse is in the civil parish of Greenham, adjoining the town of Newbury. It has courses for flat races and over jumps. It hosts one of Great Britain&#x27;s 32 Group 1 races, the Lockinge Stakes. It also hosts the Ladbrokes Trophy, which is said to be the biggest handicap race of the National Hunt season apart from the Grand National.

Windsor Racecourse, also known as Royal Windsor Racecourse is a thoroughbred horse racing venue located in Windsor. It is one of only two figure-of-eight courses in the United Kingdom. (The other is at Fontwell Park). It abandoned National Hunt jump racing in December 1998, switching entirely to flat racing.

Lambourn also has a rich history in horse racing, the well drained, spongy grass, open downs and long flats make the Lambourn Downs ideal for training racehorses. This area of West Berkshire is the largest centre of racehorse training in the UK after Newmarket, and is known as the &#x27;Valley of the Racecourse&#x27;.

===Football===

Reading F.C. is the only Berkshire football club to play professional football. Despite being founded in 1871, the club did not join the Football League until 1920, and first played in the top tier of English football in the 2006–07 season.

Newbury was home to A.F.C. Newbury, which was one of only two football clubs to be sponsored by Vodafone (the other being Manchester United). In 2006 Vodafone ended its sponsorship of the club, following which the club collapsed. A local pub team from the Old London Apprentice took over the ground temporarily and now compete in the Hellenic Football League as Newbury F.C.

There are several amateur and semi-professional football clubs in the county. These include Maidenhead United, Slough Town, Hungerford Town, Thatcham Town, Ascot United, A.F.C. Aldermaston, Sandhurst Town, Windsor F.C., Wokingham &amp; Emmbrook F.C., Bracknell Town F.C. and Reading City.

===Rugby===
Reading is a centre for rugby union football. The Premiership team London Irish were for 20 years tenants at the Madejski Stadium before their move back to SW London at a new stadium in Brentford.

Newbury&#x27;s rugby union club, Newbury R.F.C. (the Newbury &#x27;Blues&#x27;), is based in the town. In the 2004–05 season, the club finished second in the National Two division earning promotion to National One. Newbury had previously won National Four South (now renamed as National Three South) in 1996–97 with a 100% win record. In 2010–11 the club finished bottom of National League 2S, with a single win and twenty-nine defeats. The club was founded in 1928 and in 1996 moved to a new purpose-built ground at Monks Lane, which has since hosted England U21 fixtures.

===Ice hockey===
The Bracknell Bees Ice Hockey Club are former national champions, who play in the English Premier League.

Slough Jets also play in the English Premier League winning the title in 2007. Slough Jets also won the play-offs in 2005–06, 2007–08, 2009–10 &amp; 2011–12. They also won the EPIH Cup in 2010–11. Slough Jets have been in the EPIHL since 1999.

<text>Haakon VII (; 3 August 187221 September 1957) was King of Norway from 18 November 1905 until his death in 1957.

The future Haakon VII was born in Copenhagen as Prince Carl of Denmark. He was the second son of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Denmark (later King Frederick VIII and Queen Louise). Prince Carl was educated at the Royal Danish Naval Academy and served in the Royal Danish Navy. After the 1905 dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway, he was offered the Norwegian crown. Following a November plebiscite, he accepted the offer and was formally elected king of Norway by the Storting. He took the Old Norse name &quot;Haakon&quot; and ascended to the throne as Haakon VII, becoming the first independent Norwegian monarch since Olaf II in 1387.

As king, Haakon gained much sympathy from the Norwegian people. Although the Constitution of Norway vests the King with considerable executive powers, in practice Haakon confined himself to a representative and ceremonial role while rarely interfering in politics, a practice continued by his son and grandson. Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany in April 1940. Haakon rejected German demands to legitimise the Quisling regime&#x27;s puppet government, vowing to abdicate rather than do so. He refused to abdicate after going into exile in Great Britain. As such, he played a pivotal role in uniting the Norwegian nation in its resistance to the invasion and the subsequent five-year-long occupation during the Second World War. He returned to Norway in June 1945 after the defeat of Germany.

Haakon became King of Norway when his grandfather Christian IX was still reigning in Denmark, and before his father and elder brother became kings of Denmark. During his reign he saw his father Frederick VIII, his elder brother Christian X, and his nephew Frederik IX ascend the throne of Denmark in 1906, 1912, and 1947 respectively. Haakon died at the age of 85 in September 1957, after having reigned for nearly 52 years. He was succeeded by his only child and son, who ascended to the throne as Olav V.

==Early life==
===Birth and family===

Prince Carl was born on 3 August 1872 at his parents&#x27; country residence, Charlottenlund Palace north of Copenhagen, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Christian IX. He was the second son of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark (the future King Frederick VIII), and his wife Louise of Sweden. His father was the eldest son of King Christian IX and Louise of Hesse-Kassel, and his mother was the only daughter of King Charles XV of Sweden (who was also king of Norway as Charles IV), and Louise of the Netherlands. At birth, he was third in the succession to the Danish throne after his father and older brother, but without any real prospect of inheriting the throne. The young prince was baptised at Charlottenlund Palace on 7 September 1872 by the Bishop of Zealand, Hans Lassen Martensen. He was baptised with the names &quot;Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel&quot;, and was known as Prince Carl (namesake of his maternal grandfather the King of Sweden-Norway, who died only 11 days after his baptism).

Carl belonged to the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (often shortened to Glücksburg) branch of the House of Oldenburg. The House of Oldenburg had been the Danish royal family since 1448; between 1536 and 1814 it also ruled Norway, which was then part of the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway. The house was originally from northern Germany, where the Glücksburg (Lyksborg) branch held their small fief. The family had links with Norway beginning from the 15th century. Several of his paternal ancestors had been kings of Norway in union with Denmark and at times Sweden. They included Christian I, Frederick I, Christian III, Frederick II, Christian IV, and Frederick III. Frederick III integrated Norway into the Oldenburg state with Denmark, Schleswig and Holstein. His subsequent paternal ancestors had been dukes in Schleswig-Holstein. Christian Frederick, who was King of Norway briefly in 1814, the first king of the Norwegian 1814 constitution and struggle for independence, was his great-granduncle.

===Childhood and education===

Carl was raised with his siblings in the royal household in Copenhagen, and grew up between his parents&#x27; residence in Copenhagen, the Frederick VIII&#x27;s Palace, an 18th-century palace which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen, and their country residence, Charlottenlund Palace, located by the coastline of the Øresund strait north of the city. In contrast to the usual practice of the period, where royal children were brought up by governesses, the children were raised by Crown Princess Louise herself. Under the supervision of their mother, the children received a rather strict Christian-dominated upbringing, which was characterized by severity, the fulfillment of duties, care and order.

As a younger son of the Crown Prince, there was little expectation that Carl would become king. He was third in line to the throne after his father and elder brother, Prince Christian, and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother. Carl was less than two years younger than Christian, and the two princes were educated together at home by private tutors and had a joint confirmation at Christiansborg Palace Chapel in 1887.

After his confirmation, as was customary for princes at that time, Carl was expected to start a military education. It was decided that he, in accordance with his own wishes, should enter the Royal Danish Navy. He was educated at the Royal Danish Naval Academy from 1889 to 1893, graduating as a second lieutenant. He subsequently remained in service with the Royal Danish Navy until his appointment as Norwegian king in 1905. In 1894 he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and in 1905 to the rank of admiral. During his naval career, he took part in several naval expeditions, including one in 1904–1905 with the protected cruiser to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.

===Marriage===

On 28 October 1895, at the age of 23, Carl was engaged to his first cousin Princess Maud of Wales. Princess Maud was the youngest daughter of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom). The Princess of Wales was Carl&#x27;s aunt, being the eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise. The wedding was celebrated on 22 July 1896, in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace, and was attended by the bride&#x27;s grandmother, the 77-year-old Queen Victoria.

After the wedding, the couple settled in Copenhagen, where Carl continued his career as a naval officer. They took up residence in the Bernstorff Mansion, an 18th-century Rococo style townhouse owned by Carl&#x27;s uncle King George I of Greece, situated in Bredgade immediately adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace complex. Furthermore, the bride&#x27;s father gave them Appleton House on the Sandringham Estate as a country residence for his daughter&#x27;s frequent visits to England. It was there that the couple&#x27;s only child, Prince Alexander, the future Crown Prince Olav (and eventually King Olav V of Norway), was born on 2 July 1903.

==Accession to the Norwegian throne==

===Background and election===
Following several years of disagreements on various topics, the Union between Sweden and Norway which had existed since 1814 was dissolved in 1905. The union was unilaterally dissolved by the Storting (Norwegian parliament) on 7 June, and the dissolution was later confirmed by the Norwegian people in the 1905 Norwegian union dissolution referendum held on 13 August. After weeks of negotiations, the dissolution of the union was then recognized by Sweden on 23 September in the Treaty of Karlstad, mediated by the great powers of Europe. Its provisions included the full recognition of Norway&#x27;s sovereignty and the abdication of the Swedish King Oscar II from the Norwegian throne. One month later, the union was formally dissolved as King Oscar II on 26 October signed the documents recognizing Norway as an independent state, and abdicated as Norwegian king on the same day.

Subsequently, a committee of the Norwegian government identified several princes of European royal houses as candidates for the vacant Norwegian crown. Although Norway had legally had the status of an independent state since 1814, it had not had its own king since 1387. Gradually, Prince Carl became the leading candidate, largely because he was descended from independent Norwegian kings. He also had a son, providing an heir-apparent to the throne, and the fact that his wife, Princess Maud, was a member of the British royal family was viewed by many as an advantage to the newly independent Norwegian nation.
The democratically minded Prince Carl, aware that Norway was still debating whether to remain a kingdom or to switch instead to a republican system of government, was flattered by the Norwegian government&#x27;s overtures, but he made his acceptance of the offer conditional on the holding of a referendum to show whether monarchy was the choice of the Norwegian people. After the referendum overwhelmingly confirmed by a 79 percent majority (259,563 votes for and 69,264 against) that Norwegians desired to remain a monarchy, Prince Carl was formally offered the throne of Norway by the Storting (parliament) and was elected on 18 November 1905. When Carl accepted the offer that same evening (after the approval of his grandfather Christian IX of Denmark), he immediately endeared himself to his adopted country by taking the Old Norse name of Haakon, a name which had not been used by kings of Norway for over 500 years. In so doing, he succeeded his maternal great-uncle, Oscar II of Sweden, who had abdicated the Norwegian throne in October.

Two days later, on the morning of 20 November, a large crowd gathered outside King Haakon and Queen Maud&#x27;s residence in Bernstorff&#x27;s Palace in Copenhagen. The attendees greeted the royal couple as they appeared in the window and started singing the patriotic song &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot;. Later the same day, King Christian IX of Denmark received a delegation from the Storting in an audience in Christian VII&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg. The delegation conveyed the message that the king&#x27;s grandson had been elected King of Norway, while Christian IX expressed his consent to the election of Prince Carl. The head of the delegation, the President of the Storting Carl Berner, conveyed a greeting and congratulations from the Norwegian people, and expressed the people&#x27;s wishes for a happy cooperation. The king replied: 

Mr. President of the Storthing, gentlemen: The first greeting from the Representatives of the Norwegian People, who in their unanimous Storthing decision on 18 November has elected me their King, has touched me very deeply. The people have thereby shown me a confidence which I know how to appreciate, and which I hope will still grow stronger as it gets to know my wife and me. As it will be known to you, gentlemen, it was at my request that the newly concluded referendum took place. I wanted to be sure that it was a people and not a party that wanted me to be king, as my task above all should be to unite, not divide. My life I will devote to the good of Norway, and it is the fervent wish of my wife and I that the people who have chosen us will unite to cooperate and strive towards this great goal, and with full confidence I can then take as my motto: ALL FOR NORWAY!
=== Arrival in Norway ===

Just three days later, on 23 November, the new Norwegian royal family left Copenhagen for Norway on board the Danish royal yacht, the paddle steamer &quot;Dannebrog&quot;. After crossing the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, the Dannebrog entered the Oslofjord, where at Oscarsborg Fortress near Drøbak, the family boarded the Norwegian naval ship . The &quot;Heimdal&quot; then sailed the king the last part of the stretch from Drøbak, and after a two-day journey, the family arrived to Kristiania (now Oslo) early on the morning of 25 November 1905.
The king was received at the harbour by the Prime Minister of Norway Christian Michelsen. On the deck of the &quot;Heimdal&quot;, the Prime Minister gave the following speech to the king:
For almost 600 years, the Norwegian people have not had their own king. Never has he been completely our own. Always have we had to share him with others. Never has he had his home with us. But where the home is, there will also be the fatherland. Today it is different. Today, Norway&#x27;s young king comes to build his future home in Norway&#x27;s capital. Named by a free people as a free man to lead his country, he will be completely our own. Once again, the Norwegians&#x27; king will be the strong, unifying mark for all national deeds in the new, independent Norway ...

Two days later, on 27 November, Haakon VII took his constitutional oath before parliament as Norway&#x27;s first independent king in 518 years. However, Norway counts 18 November, the day of his election, as the formal beginning of his reign.

=== Coronation ===

On 22 June 1906, King Haakon and Queen Maud were solemnly crowned and anointed in the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim by the Bishop of Trondheim Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen. The coronation was in keeping with the constitutional mandate, but many Norwegian statesmen had come to regard coronation rites as &quot;undemocratic and archaic&quot;. The coronation clause was deleted from Norway&#x27;s constitution in 1908, and although coronations are not expressly banned under current Norwegian legislation, this became the most recent coronation of a Norwegian monarch. In the period before and after the coronation, the King and Queen made an extensive coronation journey through Norway.

The King and Queen moved into the Royal Palace in Oslo. Haakon became the first monarch to use the palace permanently and the palace was therefore refurbished for two years before he, Queen Maud and Crown Prince Olav could move in. While the Royal Palace was being refurbished, the King and Queen Maud lived their first year in Norway at the &quot;Bygdøy Royal Estate&quot; in Oslo which they continued to use frequently as a summer residence. After the coronation, King Haakon and Queen Maud also received the estate &quot;Kongesæteren&quot; at Holmenkollen in Oslo as a gift from the Norwegian people.

==Early reign==

King Haakon gained much sympathy from the Norwegian people. He travelled extensively through Norway. As king, Haakon endeavored to redefine the role of the monarchy in egalitarian Norway and to find a balance between the informal Norwegian way of life and the monarchy&#x27;s need for formal representation. Although the Constitution of Norway vests the King with considerable executive powers, in practice nearly all major governmental decisions were made by the Government (the Council of State) in his name. Haakon confined himself to non-partisan roles without interfering in politics, a practice continued by his son and grandson. However, his long rule gave him considerable moral authority as a symbol of the country&#x27;s unity.

At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the Norwegian government advocated that Norway pursue a policy of neutrality. The King supported the policy of neutrality by participating in the so-called meeting of the Three Kings held on 18 December 1914 in Malmö in Sweden. There, the three Scandinavian monarchs King Haakon, King Christian X of Denmark (Haakon&#x27;s brother) and King Gustav V of Sweden (Haakon&#x27;s mother&#x27;s cousin) met along with their foreign ministers to discuss and emphasize the neutrality of the Nordic countries, and in a joint declaration, confirmed the three states&#x27; strict neutrality during the war. The meeting in 1914 was followed by another three-kings meeting in Kristiania in November 1917.

In 1927, the Labour Party became the largest party in parliament and early the following year Norway&#x27;s first Labour Party government rose to power. The Labour Party was considered to be &quot;revolutionary&quot; by many and the deputy prime minister at the time advised against appointing Christopher Hornsrud as Prime Minister. Haakon, however, refused to abandon parliamentary convention and asked Hornsrud to form a new government. In response to some of his detractors he stated, &quot;I am also the King of the Communists&quot; ().
On 21 March 1929, Crown Prince Olav married his first cousin Princess Märtha of Sweden at the Oslo Cathedral. Princess Märtha was the daughter of Haakon&#x27;s sister Princess Ingeborg and Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland. It was the first royal wedding in Norway after the dissolution of the union, and the alliance was met with great enthusiasm, also in Sweden, and it was seen as a sign that all the disharmony after the events of 1905 had now passed. Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha were to have three children: Ragnhild (1930–2012), Astrid (born 1932) and Harald (born 1937), who was to become king in 1991.

During the Eastern Greenland Case, a territorial dispute between Norway and Denmark about the sovereignty over Eastern Greenland, a very tense atmosphere prevailed. On 5 April 1933, Norway lost the arbitration case which had been submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. The next day, quoted across the front page the telegram King Haakon had sent to his brother King Christian X: 

Queen Maud died unexpectedly while visiting the United Kingdom on 20 November 1938. In 1939, King Haakon toured southeast Montana and parts of the proposed secessionist state of Absaroka, with supporters of the secession movement claiming this event as formal recognition of their state.

==Resistance during World War II==

===The German invasion===

Norway was invaded by the naval and air forces of Nazi Germany during the early hours of 9 April 1940. The German naval detachment sent to capture Oslo was opposed by Oscarsborg Fortress. The fortress fired at the invaders, sinking the heavy cruiser &quot;Blücher&quot; and damaging the heavy cruiser &quot;Lützow&quot;, with heavy German losses that included many soldiers, Gestapo agents, and administrative personnel who were to have occupied the Norwegian capital. This led to the withdrawal of the rest of the German flotilla, preventing the invaders&#x27; planned dawn occupation of Oslo. The Germans&#x27; delay in occupying Oslo, along with swift action by the president of the Storting, C. J. Hambro, created the opportunity for the royal family, the cabinet, and most of the 150 members of the Storting (parliament) to make a hasty departure from the capital by special train.

The Storting first convened at Hamar the same afternoon, but with the rapid advance of German troops, the group moved on to Elverum. The assembled Storting unanimously enacted a resolution, the so-called Elverum Authorization, granting the cabinet full powers to protect the country until such time as the Storting could meet again.

The next day, Curt Bräuer, the German Ambassador to Norway, demanded a meeting with Haakon. The German diplomat called on Haakon to accept Adolf Hitler&#x27;s demands to end all resistance and appoint Vidkun Quisling as prime minister. Quisling, the leader of Norway&#x27;s fascist party, the Nasjonal Samling, had declared himself prime minister hours earlier in Oslo as head of what would be a German puppet government; had Haakon formally appointed him, it would effectively have given legal sanction to the invasion. Bräuer suggested that Haakon follow the example of the Danish government and his brother, Christian X, which had surrendered almost immediately after the previous day&#x27;s invasion, and threatened Norway with harsh reprisals if it did not surrender. Haakon told Bräuer that he could not make the decision himself, but could only act on the advice of the Government.

In a meeting in Nybergsund, the King reported the German ultimatum to the cabinet sitting as a council of state. Haakon told the cabinet:

I am deeply affected by the responsibility laid on me if the German demand is rejected. The responsibility for the calamities that will befall people and country is indeed so grave that I dread to take it. It rests with the government to decide, but my position is clear.

For my part I cannot accept the German demands. It would conflict with all that I have considered to be my duty as King of Norway since I came to this country nearly thirty-five years ago.
Haakon went on to say that he could not appoint Quisling as prime minister, since he knew neither the people nor the Storting had confidence in him. However, if the cabinet felt otherwise, the King said he would abdicate so as not to stand in the way of the Government&#x27;s decision.

Nils Hjelmtveit, Minister of Church and Education, later wrote:

This made a great impression on us all. More clearly than ever before, we could see the man behind the words; the king who had drawn a line for himself and his task, a line from which he could not deviate. We had through the five years [in government] learned to respect and appreciate our king, and now, through his words, he came to us as a great man, just and forceful; a leader in these fatal times to our country.
Inspired by Haakon&#x27;s stand, the government unanimously advised him not to appoint any government headed by Quisling. Within hours, it telephoned its refusal to Bräuer. That night, NRK broadcast the government&#x27;s rejection of the German demands to the Norwegian people. In that same broadcast, the government announced that it would resist the German invasion as long as possible, and expressed their confidence that Norwegians would lend their support to the cause.

After Norway was eventually conquered, Quisling &quot;transformed [the country] into a one-party fascist state and recruited 6,000 Norwegians to fight alongside the Germans on the Russian front&quot;. A very small percentage of the population supported Quisling and many joined the Norwegian resistance movement. After the war, Quisling was convicted of treason and executed.

===Norwegian campaign===

The following morning, 11 April 1940, in an attempt to wipe out Norway&#x27;s unyielding king and government, bombers attacked Nybergsund, destroying the small town where the Government was staying. Neutral Sweden was only away, but the Swedish government decided it would &quot;detain and incarcerate&quot; King Haakon if he crossed their border (which Haakon never forgave). The Norwegian king and his ministers took refuge in the snow-covered woods and escaped harm, continuing farther north through the mountains toward Molde on Norway&#x27;s west coast. As the British forces in the area lost ground under Luftwaffe bombardment, the King and his party were taken aboard the British cruiser HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; at Molde and conveyed a further north to Tromsø, where a provisional capital was established on 1 May. Haakon and Crown Prince Olav took up residence in a forest cabin in Målselvdalen valley in inner Troms County, where they would stay until evacuation to the United Kingdom.

The Allies had a fairly secure hold over northern Norway until late May. The situation was dramatically altered, however, by their deteriorating situation in the Battle of France. With the Germans rapidly overrunning France, the Allied high command decided that the forces in northern Norway should be withdrawn. The royal family and Norwegian government were evacuated from Tromsø on 7 June aboard HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot; with a total of 461 passengers. This evacuation became extremely costly for the Royal Navy when the German warships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; attacked and sank the nearby aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; with its escorting destroyers HMS &quot;Acasta&quot; and HMS &quot;Ardent&quot;. &quot;Devonshire&quot; did not rebroadcast the enemy sighting report made by &quot;Glorious&quot; as it could not disclose its position by breaking radio silence. No other British ship received the sighting report, and 1,519 British officers and men and three warships were lost. &quot;Devonshire&quot; arrived safely in London and King Haakon and his Cabinet set up a Norwegian government in exile in the British capital.

===Government in exile===
Initially, King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav were guests at Buckingham Palace, but at the start of the London Blitz in September 1940, they moved to Bowdown House in Berkshire. The construction of the adjacent RAF Greenham Common airfield in March 1942 prompted another move to Foliejon Park in Winkfield, near Windsor, in Berkshire, where they remained until the liberation of Norway.

Haakon also spent time at Carbisdale Castle in Sutherland, Scotland, made available for his use by Theodore Salvesen, a ship-owner of Norwegian extraction.

The King&#x27;s official residence was the Norwegian Legation at 10 Palace Green, Kensington, which became the seat of the Norwegian government in exile. Here Haakon attended weekly Cabinet meetings and worked on the speeches which were regularly broadcast by radio to Norway by the BBC World Service. These broadcasts helped to cement Haakon&#x27;s position as an important national symbol to the Norwegian resistance. Many broadcasts were made from Saint Olav&#x27;s Norwegian Church in Rotherhithe, where the royal family were regular worshippers.

Meanwhile, Hitler had appointed Josef Terboven as &quot;&quot; for Norway. On Hitler&#x27;s orders, Terboven attempted to coerce the Storting to depose the King; the Storting declined, citing constitutional principles. A subsequent ultimatum was made by the Germans, threatening to intern all Norwegians of military age in German concentration camps. With this threat looming, the Storting&#x27;s representatives in Oslo wrote to their monarch on 27 June, asking him to abdicate. The King declined, politely replying that the Storting was acting under duress. The King gave his answer on 3 July, and proclaimed it on BBC radio on 8 July.

After one further German attempt in September to force the Storting to depose Haakon failed, Terboven finally decreed that the royal family had &quot;forfeited their right to return&quot; and dissolved the democratic political parties.
During Norway&#x27;s five years under German control, many Norwegians surreptitiously wore clothing or jewellery made from coins bearing Haakon&#x27;s &quot;H7&quot; monogram as symbols of resistance to the German occupation and of solidarity with their exiled King and Government, just as many people in Denmark wore his brother&#x27;s monogram on a pin. The King&#x27;s monogram was also painted and otherwise reproduced on various surfaces as a show of resistance to the occupation.
Nazi Germany controlled Norway until the capitulation of German forces in Europe on 8 May 1945. After the end of the war, Crown Prince Olav and five government ministers returned to a liberated Norway on 13 May 1945. Haakon and the rest of the Norwegian royal family returned to Norway aboard the cruiser , arriving with the First Cruiser Squadron to cheering crowds in Oslo on 7 June 1945, exactly five years after they had been evacuated from Tromsø.

==Post-war years==

After his return, Haakon did not continue the political role that he had played during the war, and limited himself to his constitutional duties as head of state. In the late summer of 1945 he went on an extensive tour of Norway to examine the war damage and to give consolation to the population. Because of his role during the war and his personal integrity, Haakon VII was considered the highest moral authority in the country and enjoyed great esteem in all classes of the population.

In 1947, the Norwegian people, by public subscription, purchased the royal yacht &quot;Norge&quot; for the King.

In 1952, he attended the funeral of his wife&#x27;s nephew King George VI and openly wept.

The King&#x27;s granddaughter, Princess Ragnhild, married businessman Erling Lorentzen (of the Lorentzen family) on 15 May 1953, being the first member of the new Norwegian royal family to marry a commoner.

Haakon lived to see two of his great-grandchildren born; Haakon Lorentzen (b. 23 August 1954) and Ingeborg Lorentzen (b. 3 February 1957).

Crown Princess Märtha died of cancer on 5 April 1954.

King Haakon VII fell in his bathroom at the Bygdøy Royal Estate (&quot;Bygdøy kongsgård&quot;) in July 1955. This fall, which occurred just a month before his eighty-third birthday, resulted in a fracture to the thighbone and, although there were few other complications resulting from the fall, the King was left using a wheelchair. The once-active King was said to have been depressed by his resulting helplessness and began to lose his customary involvement and interest in current events. With Haakon&#x27;s loss of mobility, and as his health deteriorated further in the summer of 1957, Crown Prince Olav appeared on behalf of his father on ceremonial occasions and took a more active role in state affairs.
The Norwegian Post Office issued three sets of commemorative postage stamps to honour their King:

1952 – Two stamps issued 2 August to celebrate the King&#x27;s 80th birthday.
1955 – Two stamps issued 25 November to celebrate the King&#x27;s 50 years on the throne.
1957 – Two stamps issued 3 August to celebrate the King&#x27;s 85th birthday.

An additional set was issued in 1972 to commemorate the late King&#x27;s 100th anniversary of his birth.

=== Death and succession ===

Haakon died at the Royal Palace in Oslo on 21 September 1957. He was 85 years old. At his death, Olav succeeded him as Olav V. Haakon was buried on 1 October 1957 alongside his wife in the white sarcophagus in the Royal Mausoleum at Akershus Fortress. He was the last surviving son of King Frederick VIII of Denmark.

== Legacy ==
Haakon VII is regarded by many as one of the greatest Norwegian leaders of the pre-war period, managing to hold his young and fragile country together in unstable political conditions. He was ranked highly in the Norwegian of the Century poll in 2005.

==Honours==

The King Haakon VII Sea in East Antarctica is named in the king&#x27;s honour as well as the entire plateau surrounding the South Pole was named &quot;King Haakon VII Vidde&quot; by Roald Amundsen when he in 1911 became the first human to reach the South Pole. See Polheim.

In 1914 Haakon County in the American state of South Dakota was named in his honour.

Two Royal Norwegian Navy ships—&quot;King Haakon VII&quot;, an escort ship in commission from 1942 to 1951, and &quot;Haakon VII&quot;, a training ship in commission from 1958 to 1974—have been named after King Haakon VII.

For his struggles against the Nazi regime and his effort to revive the Holmenkollen ski festival following World War II, King Haakon VII earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1955 (Shared with Hallgeir Brenden, Veikko Hakulinen, and Sverre Stenersen), one of only 11 people not famous for Nordic skiing to receive this honour. (The others are Norway&#x27;s Stein Eriksen, Borghild Niskin, Inger Bjørnbakken, Astrid Sandvik, King Olav V (his son), Erik Håker, Jacob Vaage, King Harald V (his paternal grandson), and Queen Sonja (his paternal granddaughter-in-law), and Sweden&#x27;s Ingemar Stenmark).

;Foreign
==In popular culture==
Haakon was portrayed by Jakob Cedergren in the 2009 NRK drama series &quot;Harry &amp; Charles&quot;, a series that focused on the events leading up to the election of King Haakon in 1905. Jesper Christensen portrayed the King in the 2016 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Choice&quot; (&quot;Kongens nei&quot;) which was based on the events surrounding the German invasion of Norway and the King&#x27;s decision to resist. The film won widespread critical acclaim, and was Norway&#x27;s submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards. The film made the shortlist of nine finalists in December 2016. Haakon was portrayed by Søren Pilmark in the 2020 NRK drama series &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot;, a series regarding Crown Princess Märtha&#x27;s handling of the royal family exile from 1939 to 1945.

<text>A noun phrase – or NP or nominal (phrase) – is a phrase that usually has a noun or pronoun as its head, and has the same grammatical functions as a noun. Noun phrases are very common cross-linguistically, and they may be the most frequently occurring phrase type.

Noun phrases often function as verb subjects and objects, as predicative expressions, and as complements of prepositions. One NP can be embedded inside another NP; for instance, &quot;some of his constituents&quot; has as a constituent the shorter NP &quot;his constituents&quot;.

In some theories of grammar, noun phrases with determiners are analyzed as having the determiner as the head of the phrase, see for instance Chomsky (1995) and Hudson (1990) .

==Identification==
Some examples of noun phrases are underlined in the sentences below. The head noun appears in bold. 
::This election-year&#x27;s politics are annoying for many people.
::Almost every sentence contains at least one noun phrase.
::Current economic weakness may be a result of high energy prices.

Noun phrases can be identified by the possibility of pronoun substitution, as is illustrated in the examples below.

::a. This sentence contains two noun phrases. 
::b. It contains them.
::a. The subject noun phrase that is present in this sentence is long. 
::b. It is long.
::a. Noun phrases can be embedded in other noun phrases. 
::b. They can be embedded in them.

A string of words that can be replaced by a single pronoun without rendering the sentence grammatically unacceptable is a noun phrase. As to whether the string must contain at least two words, see the following section.

==Status of single words as phrases==
Traditionally, a phrase is understood to contain two or more words. The traditional progression in the size of syntactic units is &quot;word &lt; phrase &lt; clause&quot;, and in this approach a single word (such as a noun or pronoun) would not be referred to as a phrase. However, many modern schools of syntax – especially those that have been influenced by X-bar theory – make no such restriction. Here many single words are judged to be phrases based on a desire for theory-internal consistency. A phrase is deemed to be a word or a combination of words that appears in a set syntactic position, for instance in subject position or object position.

On this understanding of phrases, the nouns and pronouns in bold in the following sentences are noun phrases (as well as nouns or pronouns):

::He saw someone.
::Milk is good.
::They spoke about corruption.

The words in bold are called phrases since they appear in the syntactic positions where multiple-word phrases (i.e. traditional phrases) can appear. This practice takes the constellation to be primitive rather than the words themselves. The word &quot;he&quot;, for instance, functions as a pronoun, but within the sentence it also functions as a noun phrase. The phrase structure grammars of the Chomskyan tradition (government and binding theory and the minimalist program) are primary examples of theories that apply this understanding of phrases. Other grammars such as dependency grammars are likely to reject this approach to phrases, since they take the words themselves to be primitive. For them, phrases must contain two or more words.

==Components==
A typical noun phrase consists of a noun (the head of the phrase) together with zero or more dependents of various types. (These dependents, since they modify a noun, are called &quot;adnominal&quot;.) The chief types of these dependents are:
*determiners, such as &quot;the&quot;, &quot;this&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot;
*attributive adjectives, such as &quot;large&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;sweeter&quot;
*adjective phrases and participial phrases, such as &quot;extremely large&quot;, &quot;hard as nails&quot;, &quot;made of wood&quot;, &quot;sitting on the step&quot;
* noun adjuncts, such as &quot;college&quot; in the noun phrase &quot;French language&quot;
* nouns in certain oblique cases, in languages which have them, such as French &quot;des Mannes&quot; (&quot;of the man&quot;; genitive form)
*prepositional phrases, such as &quot;in the drawing room&quot;, &quot;of his aunt&quot;
*adnominal adverbs and adverbials, such as &quot;(over) there&quot; in the noun phrase &quot;the man (over) there&quot;
*relative clauses, such as &quot;which we noticed&quot;
*other clauses serving as complements to the noun, such as &quot;that God exists&quot; in the noun phrase &quot;the belief that God exists&quot;
*infinitive phrases, such as &quot;to sing well&quot; and &quot;to beat&quot; in the noun phrases &quot;a desire to sing well&quot; and &quot;the man to beat&quot;

The allowability, form and position of these elements depend on the syntax of the language in question. In English, determiners, adjectives (and some adjective phrases) and noun modifiers precede the head noun, whereas the heavier units – phrases and clauses – generally follow it. This is part of a strong tendency in English to place heavier constituents to the right, making English more of a head-initial language. Head-final languages (e.g. Japanese and Turkish) are more likely to place all modifiers before the head noun. Other languages, such as French, often place even single-word adjectives after the noun.

Noun phrases can take different forms than that described above, for example when the head is a pronoun rather than a noun, or when elements are linked with a coordinating conjunction such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;but&quot;. For more information about the structure of noun phrases in English, see .

==Syntactic function==
Noun phrases typically bear argument functions. That is, the syntactic functions that they fulfill are those of the arguments of the main clause predicate, particularly those of subject, object and predicative expression. They also function as arguments in such constructs as participial phrases and prepositional phrases. For example:

::For us the news is a concern. 

::Have you heard the news? 

::That is the news. 

::They are talking about the news. 

::The man reading the news is very tall. 

Sometimes a noun phrase can also function as an adjunct of the main clause predicate, thus taking on an adverbial function, e.g.

::Most days I read the newspaper.

::She has been studying all night.

==With and without determiners==
In some languages, including English, noun phrases are required to be &quot;completed&quot; with a determiner in many contexts, and thus a distinction is made in syntactic analysis between phrases that have received their required determiner (such as &quot;the big house&quot;), and those in which the determiner is lacking (such as &quot;big house&quot;).

The situation is complicated by the fact that in some contexts a noun phrase may nonetheless be used without a determiner (as in &quot;I like big houses&quot;); in this case the phrase may be described as having a &quot;null determiner&quot;. (Situations in which this is possible depend on the rules of the language in question; for English, see English articles.)

In the original X-bar theory, the two respective types of entity are called noun phrase (NP) and N-bar (N, N). Thus in the sentence &quot;Here is the big house&quot;, both &quot;house&quot; and &quot;big house&quot; are N-bars, while &quot;the big house&quot; is a noun phrase. In the sentence &quot;I like big houses&quot;, both &quot;houses&quot; and &quot;big houses&quot; are N-bars, but &quot;big houses&quot; also functions as a noun phrase (in this case without an explicit determiner).

In some modern theories of syntax, however, what are called &quot;noun phrases&quot; above are no longer considered to be headed by a noun, but by the determiner (which may be null), and they are thus called &quot;determiner phrases&quot; (DP) instead of noun phrases. (In some accounts that take this approach, the constituent lacking the determiner – that called N-bar above – may be referred to as a noun phrase.)

This analysis of noun phrases is widely referred to as the &quot;DP hypothesis&quot;. It has been the preferred analysis of noun phrases in the minimalist program from its start (since the early 1990s), though the arguments in its favor tend to be theory-internal. By taking the determiner, a function word, to be head over the noun, a structure is established that is analogous to the structure of the finite clause, with a complementizer. Apart from the minimalist program, however, the DP hypothesis is rejected by most other modern theories of syntax and grammar, in part because these theories lack the relevant functional categories. Dependency grammars, for instance, almost all assume the traditional NP analysis of noun phrases.

For illustrations of different analyses of noun phrases depending on whether the DP hypothesis is rejected or accepted, see the next section.

==Tree representations==
The representation of noun phrases using parse trees depends on the basic approach to syntactic structure adopted. The layered trees of many phrase structure grammars grant noun phrases an intricate structure that acknowledges a hierarchy of functional projections. Dependency grammars, in contrast, since the basic architecture of dependency places a major limitation on the amount of structure that the theory can assume, produce simple, relatively flat structures for noun phrases.

The representation also depends on whether the noun or the determiner is taken to be the head of the phrase (see the discussion of the DP hypothesis in the previous section).

Below are some possible trees for the two noun phrases &quot;the big house&quot; and &quot;big houses&quot; (as in the sentences &quot;Here is the big house&quot; and &quot;I like big houses&quot;).

1. Phrase-structure trees, first using the original X-bar theory, then using the current DP approach:


2. Dependency trees, first using the traditional NP approach, then using the DP approach:

The following trees represent a more complex phrase. For simplicity, only dependency-based trees are given.

The first tree is based on the traditional assumption that nouns, rather than determiners, are the heads of phrases.

The head noun &quot;picture&quot; has the four dependents &quot;the&quot;, &quot;old&quot;, &quot;of Fred&quot;, and &quot;that I found in the drawer&quot;. The tree shows how the lighter dependents appear as pre-dependents (preceding their head) and the heavier ones as post-dependents (following their head).

The second tree assumes the DP hypothesis, namely that determiners serve as phrase heads, rather than nouns.

The determiner &quot;the&quot; is now depicted as the head of the entire phrase, thus making the phrase a determiner phrase. There is still a noun phrase present (&quot;old picture of Fred that I found in the drawer&quot;) but this phrase is below the determiner.

== History ==
An early conception of the noun phrase can be found in &quot;First work in English&quot; by Alexander Murison. In this conception a noun phrase is &quot;the infinitive of the verb&quot; (p. 146), which may appear &quot;in any position in the sentence where a noun may appear&quot;. For example, &quot;to be just is more important than to be generous&quot; has two underlined infinitives which may be replaced by nouns, as in &quot;justice is more important than generosity&quot;. This same conception can be found in subsequent grammars, such as 1878&#x27;s &quot;A Tamil Grammar&quot; or 1882&#x27;s &quot;Murby&#x27;s English grammar and analysis&quot;, where the conception of an X phrase is a phrase that can stand in for X. By 1912, the concept of a noun phrase as being based around a noun can be found, for example, &quot;an adverbial noun phrases is a group of words of which the noun is the base word, that tells the time or place of an action, or how long, how far, or how much&quot;. By 1924, the idea of a noun phrase being a noun plus dependents seems to be established. For example, &quot;Note order of words in noun-phrase--noun + adj. + genitive&quot; suggests a more modern conception of noun phrases.

<doc id="64959" wikidata="Q10294" url="?curid=64959" title="Poverty">
<text>Poverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living. Poverty can have diverse environmental, legal, social, economic, and political causes and effects. When evaluating poverty in statistics or economics there are two main measures: &quot;absolute poverty&quot; which compares income against the amount needed to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter; secondly, &quot;relative poverty&quot; measures when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. The definition of &quot;relative poverty&quot; varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.

Statistically, , most of the world&#x27;s population live in poverty: in PPP dollars, 85% of people live on less than $30 per day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and 10% live on less than $1.90 per day. According to the World Bank Group in 2020, more than 40% of the poor live in conflict-affected countries. Even when countries experience economic development, the poorest citizens of middle-income countries frequently do not gain an adequate share of their countries&#x27; increased wealth to leave poverty. Governments and non-governmental organizations have experimented with a number of different policies and programs for poverty alleviation, such as electrification in rural areas or housing first policies in urban areas. The international policy frameworks for poverty alleviation, established by the United Nations in 2015, are summarized in Sustainable Development Goal 1: &quot;No Poverty&quot;.

Social forces, such as gender, disability, race and ethnicity, can exacerbate issues of poverty—with women, children and minorities frequently bearing unequal burdens of poverty. Moreover, impoverished individuals are more vulnerable to the effects of other social issues, such as the environmental effects of industry or the impacts of climate change or other natural disasters or extreme weather events. Poverty can also make other social problems worse; economic pressures on impoverished communities frequently play a part in deforestation, biodiversity loss and ethnic conflict. For this reason, the UN&#x27;s Sustainable Development Goals and other international policy programs, such as the international recovery from COVID-19, emphasize the connection of poverty alleviation with other societal goals.

== Definitions and etymology ==
The word &quot;poverty&quot; comes from the old (Norman) French word &quot;poverté&quot; (Modern French: &quot;pauvreté),&quot; from Latin &quot;paupertās&quot; from &quot;pauper&quot; (poor).

There are several definitions of poverty depending on the context of the situation it is placed in. It usually references a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.

United Nations: Fundamentally, poverty is a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one&#x27;s food or a job to earn one&#x27;s living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.

World Bank: Poverty is pronounced deprivation in well-being, and comprises many dimensions. It includes low incomes and the inability to acquire the basic goods and services necessary for survival with dignity. Poverty also encompasses low levels of health and education, poor access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate physical security, lack of voice, and insufficient capacity and opportunity to better one&#x27;s life.

European Union (EU): The European Union&#x27;s definition of poverty is significantly different from definitions in other parts of the world, and consequently policy measures introduced to combat poverty in EU countries also differ from measures in other nations. Poverty is measured in relation to the distribution of income in each member country using relative income poverty lines. Relative-income poverty rates in the EU are compiled by the Eurostat, in charge of coordinating, gathering, and disseminating member country statistics using European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys.

== Measuring poverty ==


=== Absolute poverty ===


Absolute poverty, often synonymous with &#x27;extreme poverty&#x27; or &#x27;abject poverty&#x27;, refers to a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries. This set standard usually refers to &quot;a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also on access to services.&quot; Having an income below the poverty line, which is defined as an income needed to purchase basic needs, is also referred to as &quot;primary poverty&quot;.

The &quot;dollar a day&quot; poverty line was first introduced in 1990 as a measure to meet such standards of living. For nations that do not use the US dollar as currency, &quot;dollar a day&quot; does not translate to living a day on the equivalent amount of local currency as determined by the exchange rate. Rather, it is determined by the purchasing power parity rate, which would look at how much local currency is needed to buy the same things that a dollar could buy in the United States. Usually, this would translate to having less local currency than if the exchange rate were used.

From 1993 through 2005, the World Bank defined absolute poverty as $1.08 a day on such a purchasing power parity basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 US dollar In 2009, it was updated as $1.25 a day (equivalent to $1.00 a day in 1996 US prices) and in 2015, it was updated as living on less than US$1.90 per day, and &quot;moderate poverty&quot; as less than $2 or $5 a day. Similarly, &#x27;ultra-poverty&#x27; is defined by a 2007 report issued by International Food Policy Research Institute as living on less than 54 cents per day. The poverty line threshold of $1.90 per day, as set by the World Bank, is controversial. Each nation has its own threshold for absolute poverty line; in the United States, for example, the absolute poverty line was US$15.15 per day in 2010 (US$22,000 per year for a family of four), while in India it was US$1.0 per day and in China the absolute poverty line was US$0.55 per day, each on PPP basis in 2010. These different poverty lines make data comparison between each nation&#x27;s official reports qualitatively difficult. Some scholars argue that the World Bank method sets the bar too high, others argue it is too low.

There is disagreement among experts as to what would be considered a realistic poverty rate with one considering it &quot;an inaccurately measured and arbitrary cut off&quot;. Some contend that a higher poverty line is needed, such as a minimum of $7.40 or even $10 to $15 a day. They argue that these levels are a minimum for basic needs and to achieve normal life expectancy.

One estimate places the true scale of poverty much higher than the World Bank, with an estimated 4.3 billion people (59% of the world&#x27;s population) living with less than $5 a day and unable to meet basic needs adequately. Philip Alston, a UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, stated the World Bank&#x27;s international poverty line of $1.90 a day is fundamentally flawed, and has allowed for &quot;self congratulatory&quot; triumphalism in the fight against extreme global poverty, which he asserts is &quot;completely off track&quot; and that nearly half of the global population, or 3.4 billion, lives on less than $5.50 a day, and this number has barely moved since 1990. Still others suggest that poverty line misleads because many live on far less than that line.

Other measures of absolute poverty without using a certain dollar amount include the standard defined as receiving less than 80% of minimum caloric intake whilst spending more than 80% of income on food, sometimes called ultra-poverty.

=== Relative poverty ===
Relative poverty views poverty as socially defined and dependent on social context. It is argued that the needs considered fundamental is not an objective measure and could change with the custom of society. For example, a person who cannot afford housing better than a small tent in an open field would be said to live in relative poverty if almost everyone else in that area lives in modern brick homes, but not if everyone else also lives in small tents in open fields (for example, in a nomadic tribe). Since richer nations would have lower levels of absolute poverty, relative poverty is considered the &quot;most useful measure for ascertaining poverty rates in wealthy developed nations&quot; and is the &quot;most prominent and most-quoted of the EU social inclusion indicators&quot;.

Usually, relative poverty is measured as the percentage of the population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income. This is a calculation of the percentage of people whose family household income falls below the Poverty Line. The main poverty line used in the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU) is based on &quot;economic distance&quot;, a level of income set at 60% of the median household income. The United States federal government typically regulates this line to three times the cost of an adequate meal.

There are several other different income inequality metrics, for example, the Gini coefficient or the Theil Index.


=== Other aspects ===

Rather than income, poverty is also measured through individual basic needs at a time. Life expectancy has greatly increased in the developing world since World War II and is starting to close the gap to the developed world. Child mortality has decreased in every developing region of the world. The proportion of the world&#x27;s population living in countries where the daily per-capita supply of food energy is less than decreased from 56% in the mid-1960s to below 10% by the 1990s. Similar trends can be observed for literacy, access to clean water and electricity and basic consumer items.
Poverty may also be understood as an aspect of unequal social status and inequitable social relationships, experienced as social exclusion, dependency, and diminished capacity to participate, or to develop meaningful connections with other people in society. Such social exclusion can be minimized through strengthened connections with the mainstream, such as through the provision of relational care to those who are experiencing poverty. The World Bank&#x27;s &quot;Voices of the Poor&quot;, based on research with over 20,000 poor people in 23 countries, identifies a range of factors which poor people identify as part of poverty. These include abuse by those in power, dis-empowering institutions, excluded locations, gender relationships, lack of security, limited capabilities, physical limitations, precarious livelihoods, problems in social relationships, weak community organizations and discrimination. Analysis of social aspects of poverty links conditions of scarcity to aspects of the distribution of resources and power in a society and recognizes that poverty may be a function of the diminished &quot;capability&quot; of people to live the kinds of lives they value. The social aspects of poverty may include lack of access to information, education, health care, social capital or political power. 

Relational poverty is the idea that societal poverty exists if there is a lack of human relationships. Relational poverty can be the result of a lost contact number, lack of phone ownership, isolation, or deliberate severing of ties with an individual or community. Relational poverty is also understood &quot;by the social institutions that organize those relationships...poverty is importantly the result of the different terms and conditions on which people are included in social life&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the second Cameron ministry came under attack for its redefinition of poverty; poverty is no longer classified by a family&#x27;s income, but as to whether a family is in work or not. Considering that two-thirds of people who found work were accepting wages that are below the living wage (according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation) this has been criticised by anti-poverty campaigners as an unrealistic view of poverty in the United Kingdom.

==== Secondary poverty ====

Secondary poverty refers to those that earn enough income to not be impoverished, but who spend their income on unnecessary pleasures, such as alcoholic beverages, thus placing them below it in practice. In 18th- and 19th-century Great Britain, the practice of temperance among Methodists, as well as their rejection of gambling, allowed them to eliminate secondary poverty and accumulate capital. Factors that contribute to secondary poverty includes but are not limited to: alcohol, gambling, tobacco and drugs. Substance abuse means that the poor typically spend about 2% of their income educating their children but larger percentages of alcohol and tobacco (for example, 6% in Indonesia and 8% in Mexico as of 2006).

===Variability===
Poverty levels are snapshot pictures in time that omits the transitional dynamics between levels. Mobility statistics supply additional information about the fraction who leave the poverty level. For example, one study finds that in a sixteen-year period (1975 to 1991 in the US) only 5% of those in the lower fifth of the income level were still at that level, while 95% transitioned to a higher income category. Poverty levels can remain the same while those who rise out of poverty are replaced by others. The transient poor and chronic poor differ in each society. In a nine-year period ending in 2005 for the US, 50% of the poorest quintile transitioned to a higher quintile.

=== Global prevalence ===
According to Chen and Ravallion, about 1.76 billion people in the developing world lived &quot;above&quot; $1.25 per day and 1.9 billion people lived &quot;below&quot; $1.25 per day in 1981. In 2005, about 4.09 billion people in the developing world lived above $1.25 per day and 1.4 billion people lived below $1.25 per day (both 1981 and 2005 data are on inflation adjusted basis). The share of the world&#x27;s population living in absolute poverty fell from 43% in 1981 to 14% in 2011. The absolute number of people in poverty fell from 1.95 billion in 1981 to 1.01 billion in 2011. The economist Max Roser estimates that the number of people in poverty is therefore roughly the same as 200 years ago. This is the case since the world population was just little more than 1 billion in 1820 and the majority (84% to 94%) of the world population was living in poverty. 

According to one study, the percentage of the world population in hunger and poverty fell in absolute percentage terms from 50% in 1950 to 30% in 1970. According to another study the number of people worldwide living in absolute poverty fell from 1.18 billion in 1950 to 1.04 billion in 1977. According to another study, the number of people worldwide estimated to be starving fell from almost 920 million in 1971 to below 797 million in 1997. The proportion of the developing world&#x27;s population living in extreme economic poverty fell from 28% in 1990 to 21% in 2001. Most of this improvement has occurred in East and South Asia.

In 1963, the Third World Food Survey estimated that 10-15% of the world’s population were undernourished and that up to half suffered from general hunger hunger and malnutrition. In subsequent decades, however, estimated levels of malnutrition and undernourshent steadily fell. From 1970 to 1990, the percentage of the world’s population estimated to be suffering from malnutrition fell from 24.8% to 15.9.%. From 1970 to 2015, the percentage of people in developing nations estimated to be undernourished fell from 34.75% to 12.90%. 

In 2012 it was estimated that, using a poverty line of $1.25 a day, 1.2 billion people lived in poverty. Given the current economic model, built on GDP, it would take 100 years to bring the world&#x27;s poorest up to the poverty line of $1.25 a day. UNICEF estimates half the world&#x27;s children (or 1.1 billion) live in poverty. The World Bank forecasted in 2015 that 702.1 million people were living in extreme poverty, down from 1.75 billion in 1990. Extreme poverty is observed in all parts of the world, including developed economies. Of the 2015 population, about 347.1 million people (35.2%) lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and 231.3 million (13.5%) lived in South Asia. According to the World Bank, between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of the world&#x27;s population living in extreme poverty fell from 37.1% to 9.6%, falling below 10% for the first time. 

During the 2013 to 2015 period, the World Bank reported that extreme poverty fell from 11% to 10%, however they also noted that the rate of decline had slowed by nearly half from the 25 year average with parts of sub-saharan Africa returning to early 2000 levels. The World Bank attributed this to increasing violence following the Arab Spring, population increases in Sub-Saharan Africa, and general African inflationary pressures and economic malaise were the primary drivers for this slow down. Many wealthy nations have seen an increase in relative poverty rates ever since the Great Recession, in particular among children from impoverished families who often reside in substandard housing and find educational opportunities out of reach. It has been argued by some academics that the neoliberal policies promoted by global financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank are actually exacerbating both inequality and poverty.

In East Asia the World Bank reported that &quot;The poverty headcount rate at the $2-a-day level is estimated to have fallen to about 27 percent [in 2007], down from 29.5 percent in 2006 and 69 percent in 1990.&quot; The People&#x27;s Republic of China accounts for over three quarters of global poverty reduction from 1990 to 2005, which according to the World Bank is &quot;historically unprecedented&quot;. China accounted for nearly half of all extreme poverty in 1990.

In Sub-Saharan Africa extreme poverty went up from 41% in 1981 to 46% in 2001, which combined with growing population increased the number of people living in extreme poverty from 231 million to 318 million. Statistics of 2018 shows population living in extreme conditions has declined by more than 1 billion in the last 25 years. As per the report published by the world bank on 19 September 2018 world poverty falls below 750 million.

In the early 1990s some of the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia experienced a sharp drop in income. The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in large declines in GDP per capita, of about 30 to 35% between 1990 and the through year of 1998 (when it was at its minimum). As a result, poverty rates tripled, excess mortality increased, and life expectancy declined. Russian President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s IMF-backed rapid privatization and austerity policies resulted in unemployment rising to double digits and half the Russian population falling into destitution by the early to mid 1990s. By 1999, during the peak of the poverty crisis, 191 million people were living on less than $5.50 a day. In subsequent years as per capita incomes recovered the poverty rate dropped from 31.4% of the population to 19.6%. The average post-communist country had returned to 1989 levels of per-capita GDP by 2005, although as of 2015 some are still far behind that. According to the World Bank in 2014, around 80 million people were still living on less than $5.00 a day.

World Bank data shows that the percentage of the population living in households with consumption or income per person below the poverty line has decreased in each region of the world except Middle East and North Africa since 1990:

In July 2023, a group of over 200 economists from 67 countries, including Jayati Ghosh, Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty, sent a letter to the United Nations secretary general António Guterres and World Bank president Ajay Banga warning that &quot;extreme poverty and extreme wealth have risen sharply and simultaneously for the first time in 25 years.&quot; In 2024, Oxfam reported that roughly five billion people have become poorer since 2020 and warned that current trends could postpone global poverty eradication for 229 years.

== Characteristics ==

The effects of poverty may also be causes of poverty thus creating a cycle of poverty operating across multiple levels, individual, local, national and global.

===Health===

One-third of deaths around the world—some 18 million people a year or 50,000 per day—are due to poverty-related causes. People living in developing nations, among them women and children, are over represented among the global poor and these effects of severe poverty. Those living in poverty suffer disproportionately from hunger or even starvation and disease, as well as lower life expectancy. According to the World Health Organization, hunger and malnutrition are the single gravest threats to the world&#x27;s public health and malnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases.

Almost 90% of maternal deaths during childbirth occur in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, compared to less than 1% in the developed world. Those who live in poverty have also been shown to have a far greater likelihood of having or incurring a disability within their lifetime. Infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis can perpetuate poverty by diverting health and economic resources from investment and productivity; malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations and AIDS decreases African growth by 0.3–1.5% annually.

Studies have shown that poverty impedes cognitive function although some of these findings could not be replicated in follow-up studies. One hypothesised mechanism is that financial worries put a severe burden on one&#x27;s mental resources so that they are no longer fully available for solving complicated problems. The reduced capability for problem solving can lead to suboptimal decisions and further perpetuate poverty. Many other pathways from poverty to compromised cognitive capacities have been noted, from poor nutrition and environmental toxins to the effects of stress on parenting behavior, all of which lead to suboptimal psychological development. Neuroscientists have documented the impact of poverty on brain structure and function throughout the lifespan.

Infectious diseases continue to blight the lives of the poor across the world. 36.8 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, with 954,492 deaths in 2017.

Poor people often are more prone to severe diseases due to the lack of health care, and due to living in non-optimal conditions. Among the poor, girls tend to suffer even more due to gender discrimination. Economic stability is paramount in a poor household; otherwise they go in an endless loop of negative income trying to treat diseases. Often when a person in a poor household falls ill it is up to the family members to take care of them due to limited access to health care and lack of health insurance. The household members often have to give up their income or stop seeking further education to tend to the sick member. There is a greater opportunity cost imposed on the poor to tend to someone compared to someone with better financial stability. Increased access to healthcare and improved health outcomes help prevent individuals from falling into poverty due to medical expenses.

==== Hunger ====


It is estimated that 1.02 billion people go to bed hungry every night. According to the Global Hunger Index, Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest child malnutrition rate of the world&#x27;s regions over the 2001–2006 period.

Poor people spend a greater portion of their budgets on food than wealthy people and, as a result, they can be particularly vulnerable to increases in food prices. For example, in late 2007, increases in the price of grains led to food riots in some countries. Threats to the supply of food may also be caused by drought and the water crisis. Intensive farming often leads to a vicious cycle of exhaustion of soil fertility and decline of agricultural yields. Approximately 40% of the world&#x27;s agricultural land is seriously degraded. Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals is the elimination of hunger and undernutrition by 2030.

==== Mental health ====

A psychological study has been conducted by four scientists during inaugural Convention of Psychological Science. The results find that people who thrive with financial stability or fall under low socioeconomic status (SES) tend to perform worse cognitively due to external pressure imposed upon them. The research found that stressors such as low income, inadequate health care, discrimination, and exposure to criminal activities all contribute to mental disorders. This study also found that children exposed to poverty-stricken environments have slower cognitive thinking. It is seen that children perform better under the care of their parents and that children tend to adopt speaking language at a younger age. Since being in poverty from childhood is more harmful than it is for an adult, it is seen that children in poor households tend to fall behind in certain cognitive abilities compared to other average families.

For a child to grow up emotionally healthy, the children under three need &quot;A strong, reliable primary caregiver who provides consistent and unconditional love, guidance, and support. Safe, predictable, stable environments. Ten to 20 hours each week of harmonious, reciprocal interactions. This process, known as attunement, is most crucial during the first 6–24 months of infants&#x27; lives and helps them develop a wider range of healthy emotions, including gratitude, forgiveness, and empathy. Enrichment through personalized, increasingly complex activities&quot;. 

In a 1996 survey, 67% of children from disadvantaged inner cities said they had witnessed a serious assault, and 33% reported witnessing a homicide. 51% of fifth graders from New Orleans (median income for a household: $27,133) have been found to be victims of violence, compared to 32% in Washington, DC (mean income for a household: $40,127). Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who live in it. The Great Smoky Mountains Study was a ten-year study that was able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.

=== Education ===

Research has found that there is a high risk of educational underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This is often a process that begins in primary school. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, children in poverty are at a higher risk than advantaged children for retention in their grade, special deleterious placements during the school&#x27;s hours and not completing their high school education. Advantage breeds advantage. There are many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. One is the conditions in which they attend school. Schools in poverty-stricken areas have conditions that hinder children from learning in a safe environment. Researchers have developed a name for areas like this: an &quot;urban war zone&quot; is a poor, crime-laden district in which deteriorated, violent, even warlike conditions and underfunded, largely ineffective schools promote inferior academic performance, including irregular attendance and disruptive or non-compliant classroom behavior. Because of poverty, &quot;Students from low-income families are 2.4 times more likely to drop out than middle-income kids, and over 10 times more likely than high-income peers to drop out.&quot;

For children with low resources, the risk factors are similar to others such as juvenile delinquency rates, higher levels of teenage pregnancy, and economic dependency upon their low-income parent or parents.
Families and society who submit low levels of investment in the education and development of less fortunate children end up with less favorable results for the children who see a life of parental employment reduction and low wages. Higher rates of early childbearing with all the connected risks to family, health and well-being are major issues to address since education from preschool to high school is identifiably meaningful in a life.

Poverty often drastically affects children&#x27;s success in school. A child&#x27;s &quot;home activities, preferences, mannerisms&quot; must align with the world and in the cases that they do not do these, students are at a disadvantage in the school and, most importantly, the classroom. Therefore, it is safe to state that children who live at or below the poverty level will have far less success educationally than children who live above the poverty line. Poor children have a great deal less healthcare and this ultimately results in many absences from school. Additionally, poor children are much more likely to suffer from hunger, fatigue, irritability, headaches, ear infections, flu, and colds. These illnesses could potentially restrict a student&#x27;s focus and concentration.

In general, the interaction of gender with poverty or location tends to work to the disadvantage of girls in poorer countries with low completion rates and social expectations that they marry early, and to the disadvantage of boys in richer countries with high completion rates but social expectations that they enter the labour force early. At the primary education level, most countries with a completion rate below 60% exhibit gender disparity at girls&#x27; expense, particularly poor and rural girls. In Mauritania, the adjusted gender parity index is 0.86 on average, but only 0.63 for the poorest 20%, while there is parity among the richest 20%. In countries with completion rates between 60% and 80%, gender disparity is generally smaller, but disparity at the expense of poor girls is especially marked in Cameroon, Nigeria and Yemen. Exceptions in the opposite direction are observed in countries with pastoralist economies that rely on boys&#x27; labour, such as the Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia.

=== Shelter ===

The right to housing is argued to be a human right. Higher density and lower cost housing affords low-income families and first-time homebuyers with more and less expensive shelter opportunities, reducing economic inequality.

The geographic concentration of poverty is argued to be a factor in entrenching poverty. William J. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;concentration and isolation&quot; hypothesis states that the economic difficulties of the very poorest African Americans are compounded by the fact that as the better-off African Americans move out, the poorest are more and more concentrated, having only other very poor people as neighbors. This concentration causes social isolation, Wilson suggests, because the very poor are now isolated from access to the job networks, role models, institutions, and other connections that might help them escape poverty. Gentrification means converting an aging neighborhood into a more affluent one, as by remodeling homes. Landlords then increase rent on newly renovated real estate; the poor people cannot afford to pay high rent, and may need to leave their neighborhood to find affordable housing. The poor also get more access to income and services, while studies suggest poor residents living in gentrifying neighbourhoods are actually less likely to move than poor residents of non-gentrifying areas.

Poverty increases the risk of homelessness. Slum-dwellers, who make up a third of the world&#x27;s urban population, live in a poverty no better, if not worse, than rural people, who are the traditional focus of the poverty in the developing world, according to a report by the United Nations.

There are over 100 million street children worldwide. Most of the children living in institutions around the world have a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty. It is speculated that, flush with money, for-profit orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. Many child advocates maintain that this can harm children&#x27;s development by separating them from their families and that it would be more effective and cheaper to aid close relatives who want to take in the orphans.

=== Utilities ===

The poor tend to pay more for access to utilities and ensuring the availability of water, sanitation, energy, and telecommunication services such as broadband internet service help in reducing poverty in general.

====Water and sanitation====
As of 2012, 2.5 billion people lack access to sanitation services and 15% practice open defecation. Even while providing latrines is a challenge, people still do not use them even when available. Bangladesh had half the GDP per capita of India but has a lower mortality from diarrhea than India or the world average, with diarrhea deaths declining by 90% since the 1990s. By strategically providing pit latrines to the poorest, charities in Bangladesh sparked a cultural change as those better off perceived it as an issue of status to not use one. The vast majority of the latrines built were then not from charities but by villagers themselves.

Water utility subsidies tend to subsidize water consumption by those connected to the supply grid, which is typically skewed towards the richer and urban segment of the population and those outside informal housing. As a result of heavy consumption subsidies, the price of water decreases to the extent that only 30%, on average, of the supplying costs in developing countries is covered.
This results in a lack of incentive to maintain delivery systems, leading to losses from leaks annually that are enough for 200 million people.
This also leads to a lack of incentive to invest in expanding the network, resulting in much of the poor population being unconnected to the network. Instead, the poor buy water from water vendors for, on average, about 5 to 16 times the metered price. However, subsidies for laying new connections to the network rather than for consumption have shown more promise for the poor.

====Energy====
=== Financial services ===

For low-income individuals and families, access to credit can be limited, predatory, or both, making it difficult to find the financial resources they need to invest in their futures.

=== Prejudice and exploitation ===

Cultural factors, such as discrimination of various kinds, can negatively affect productivity such as age discrimination, stereotyping, discrimination against people with physical disability, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, and caste discrimination. Children are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as adults. Women are the group suffering from the highest rate of poverty after children, in what is referred to as the feminization of poverty. In addition, the fact that women are more likely to be caregivers, regardless of income level, to either the generations before or after them, exacerbates the burdens of their poverty. Those in poverty have increased chances of incurring a disability which leads to a cycle where disability and poverty are mutually reinforcing.

Max Weber and some schools of modernization theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence that suggest that values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement into and out of poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. A 2018 report on poverty in the United States by UN special rapporteur Philip Alston asserts that caricatured narratives about the rich and the poor (that &quot;the rich are industrious, entrepreneurial, patriotic and the drivers of economic success&quot; while &quot;the poor are wasters, losers and scammers&quot;) are largely inaccurate, as &quot;the poor are overwhelmingly those born into poverty, or those thrust there by circumstances largely beyond their control, such as physical or mental disabilities, divorce, family breakdown, illness, old age, unlivable wages or discrimination in the job market.&quot; Societal perception of people experiencing economic difficulty has historically appeared as a conceptual dichotomy: the &quot;good&quot; poor (people who are physically impaired, disabled, the &quot;ill and incurable,&quot; the elderly, pregnant women, children) vs. the &quot;bad&quot; poor (able-bodied, &quot;valid&quot; adults, most often male).

According to experts, many women become victims of trafficking, the most common form of which is prostitution, as a means of survival and economic desperation. Deterioration of living conditions can often compel children to abandon school to contribute to the family income, putting them at risk of being exploited. For example, in Zimbabwe, a number of girls are turning to sex in return for food to survive because of the increasing poverty. According to studies, as poverty decreases there will be fewer and fewer instances of violence. Some data such as the UNICEF reports and also a research called &quot;Echo of Silence&quot; show that there is a close correlation between economic poverty and early marriage. In some developing countries, child marriage is considered an economic measure that can improve the family’s poor condition, strengthen family bonds.

==Poverty reduction ==


Various poverty reduction strategies are broadly categorized based on whether they make more of the basic human needs available or whether they increase the disposable income needed to purchase those needs. Some strategies such as building roads can both bring access to various basic needs, such as fertilizer or healthcare from urban areas, as well as increase incomes, by bringing better access to urban markets.

Reducing relative poverty would also involve reducing inequality. Oxfam, among others, has called for an international movement to end extreme wealth concentration arguing that the concentration of resources in the hands of the top 1% depresses economic activity and makes life harder for everyone else—particularly those at the bottom of the economic ladder. And they say that the gains of the world&#x27;s billionaires in 2017, which amounted to $762 billion, were enough to end extreme global poverty seven times over. Methods to reduce inequality and relative poverty include progressive taxation, which involves increasing tax rates on high-income earners, wealth taxes, which involve taxing a portion of an individual&#x27;s net worth above a certain threshold, reducing payroll taxes, which are taxes on employees and employers and reducing this provides workers greater take-home pay and allows employers to spend more on wages and salaries, and increasing the labor share, which is the proportion of business income paid as wages and salaries instead of allocated to shareholders as profit.

=== Increasing the supply of basic needs ===

==== Improving technology ====
Agricultural technologies such as nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, new seed varieties and new irrigation methods have dramatically reduced food shortages in modern times by boosting yields past previous constraints. Before the Industrial Revolution, poverty had been mostly accepted as inevitable as economies produced little, making wealth scarce. Geoffrey Parker wrote that &quot;In Antwerp and Lyon, two of the largest cities in western Europe, by 1600 three-quarters of the total population were too poor to pay taxes, and therefore likely to need relief in times of crisis.&quot; The initial industrial revolution led to high economic growth and eliminated mass absolute poverty in what is now considered the developed world. Mass production of goods in places such as rapidly industrializing China has made what were once considered luxuries, such as vehicles and computers, inexpensive and thus accessible to many who were otherwise too poor to afford them.

Other than technology, advancements in sciences such as medicine help provide basic needs better. For example, Sri Lanka had a maternal mortality rate of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today, but reduced it to 0.5–0.6% in the 1950s and to 0.6% in 2006 while spending less each year on maternal health because it learned what worked and what did not. Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive and educational measures have been made to disseminate what works, such as the Copenhagen Consensus. Cheap water filters and promoting hand washing are some of the most cost effective health interventions and can cut deaths from diarrhea and pneumonia. Fortification with micronutrients was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus. For example, iodised salt costs 2 to 3 cents per person a year while even moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy shaves off 10 to 15 IQ points.

==== State funding ====

Certain basic needs are argued to be better provided by the state. Universal healthcare can reduce the overall cost of providing healthcare by having a single payer negotiating with healthcare providers and minimizing administrative costs. It is also argued that subsidizing essential goods such as fuel is less efficient in helping the poor than providing that same money as income grants to the poor.

Government revenue can be diverted away from basic services by corruption. Funds from aid and natural resources are often sent by government individuals for money laundering to overseas banks which insist on bank secrecy, instead of spending on the poor. A Global Witness report asked for more action from Western banks as they have proved capable of stanching the flow of funds linked to terrorism.

Illicit capital flight, such as corporate tax avoidance, from the developing world is estimated at ten times the size of aid it receives and twice the debt service it pays, with one estimate that most of Africa would be developed if the taxes owed were paid. About 60 per cent of illicit capital flight from Africa is from transfer mispricing, where a subsidiary in a developing nation sells to another subsidiary or shell company in a tax haven at an artificially low price to pay less tax. An African Union report estimates that about 30% of sub-Saharan Africa&#x27;s GDP has been moved to tax havens. Solutions include corporate &quot;country-by-country reporting&quot; where corporations disclose activities in each country and thereby prohibit the use of tax havens where no effective economic activity occurs.

Developing countries&#x27; debt service to banks and governments from richer countries can constrain government spending on the poor. For example, Zambia spent 40% of its total budget to repay foreign debt, and only 7% for basic state services in 1997. One of the proposed ways to help poor countries has been debt relief. Zambia began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from a 2005 round of debt relief. Since that round of debt relief, private creditors accounted for an increasing share of poor countries&#x27; debt service obligations. This complicated efforts to renegotiate easier terms for borrowers during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic because the multiple private creditors involved say they have a fiduciary obligation to their clients such as the pension funds.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as primary holders of developing countries&#x27; debt, attach structural adjustment conditionalities in return for loans which are generally geared toward loan repayment with austerity measures such as the elimination of state subsidies and the privatization of state services. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices. In Malawi, almost 5 million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid but after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as Malawi became a major food exporter.

Distressed securities funds, also known as &quot;vulture funds&quot;, buy up the debt of poor nations cheaply and then sue countries for the full value of the debt plus interest which can be ten or 100 times what they paid. They may pursue any companies which do business with their target country to force them to pay to the fund instead. Considerable resources are diverted on costly court cases. For example, a court in Jersey ordered the Democratic Republic of the Congo to pay an American speculator $100 million in 2010. Now, the UK, Isle of Man and Jersey have banned such payments.

====Improving access to available basic needs====

Even with new products, such as better seeds, or greater volumes of them, such as industrial production, the poor still require access to these products. Improving road and transportation infrastructure helps solve this major bottleneck. In Africa, it costs more to move fertilizer from an African seaport inland than to ship it from the United States to Africa because of sparse, low-quality roads, leading to fertilizer costs two to six times the world average. Microfranchising models such as door-to-door distributors who earn commission-based income or Coca-Cola&#x27;s successful distribution system are used to disseminate basic needs to remote areas for below market prices.

The loss of basic needs providers emigrating from impoverished countries has a damaging effect. As of 2004, there were more Ethiopia-trained doctors living in Chicago than in Ethiopia and this often leaves inadequately less skilled doctors to remain in their home countries. Proposals to mitigate the problem include compulsory government service for graduates of public medical and nursing schools and promoting medical tourism so that health care personnel have more incentive to practice in their home countries. Telehealth is the use of telecommunication technologies to deliver health services. For remotes communities in Alaska, telehealth has been found to reduce travel costs alone for the state by $13 million in 2021 and, according to one study, reduced the life expectancy gap between whites and American Indian population in Alaska from eight to five years.

==== Preventing overpopulation ====
Poverty and lack of access to birth control can lead to population increases that put pressure on local economies and access to resources, amplifying other economic inequality and creating increase poverty. Better education for both men and women, and more control of their lives, reduces population growth due to family planning. According to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), those who receive better education can earn money for their lives, thereby strengthening economic security.

=== Increasing personal income ===
The following are strategies used or proposed to increase personal incomes among the poor. Raising farm incomes is described as the core of the antipoverty effort as three-quarters of the poor today are farmers. Estimates show that growth in the agricultural productivity of small farmers is, on average, at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest half of a country&#x27;s population as growth generated in nonagricultural sectors.

==== Income grants ====

A guaranteed minimum income ensures that every citizen will be able to purchase a desired level of basic needs. One method is through a basic income (or negative income tax), which is a system of social security, that periodically provides each citizen, rich or poor, with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on. Studies of large cash-transfer programs in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi show that the programs can be effective in increasing consumption, schooling, and nutrition, whether they are tied to such conditions or not. 

Employment subsidies go to those already employed and this has shown to have little effect on those at the lowest income levels. Proponents argue that a basic income is more efficient than a minimum wage and unemployment benefits, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing losses in efficiency. In 1968, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce a system of income guarantees. Winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics, with often diverse political convictions, who support a basic income include Herbert A. Simon, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Solow, Milton Friedman, Jan Tinbergen, James Tobin
and James Meade. 

Income grants are argued to be vastly more efficient in extending basic needs to the poor than subsidizing supplies whose effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. With cars and other appliances, the wealthiest 20% of Egypt uses about 93% of the country&#x27;s fuel subsidies. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education. A 2008 study concluded that the money spent on in-kind transfers in India in a year could lift all India&#x27;s poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly. Additionally, in aid models, the famine relief model increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving cash or cash vouchers to the hungry to pay local farmers instead of buying food from donor countries, often required by law, as it wastes money on transport costs. 

The primary obstacle argued against direct cash transfers is the impractically for poor countries of such large and direct transfers. In practice, payments determined by complex iris scanning are used by war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan, while India modified its subsidies in favor of direct transfers. Central bank digital currencies are argued to be an efficient tool in direct cash transfers to the poor as it can reach the unbanked and be more cost effective without having to physically send money and without needing an intermediary such as a bank.

==== Economic freedoms ====

Corruption often leads to many civil services being treated by governments as employment agencies to loyal supporters and so it could mean going through 20 procedures, paying $2,696 in fees, and waiting 82 business days to start a business in Bolivia, while in Canada it takes two days, two registration procedures, and $280 to do the same. Such costly barriers favor big firms at the expense of small enterprises, where most jobs are created. Often, businesses have to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which is, in effect, a tax on business. Noted reductions in poverty in recent decades has occurred in China and India mostly as a result of the abandonment of collective farming in China and the ending of the central planning model known as the License Raj in India.

The World Bank concludes that governments and feudal elites extending to the poor the right to the land that they live and use are &#x27;the key to reducing poverty&#x27; citing that land rights greatly increase poor people&#x27;s wealth, in some cases doubling it. Providing secure tenure to land ownership creates incentives to improve the land and thus improves the welfare of the poor. It is argued that those in power have an incentive to not secure property rights as they are able to then more easily take land or any small business that does well to their supporters.

Greater access to markets brings more income to the poor. Road infrastructure has a direct impact on poverty. Additionally, migration from poorer countries resulted in $328 billion sent from richer to poorer countries in 2010, more than double the $120 billion in official aid flows from OECD members. In 2011, India got $52 billion from its diaspora, more than it took in foreign direct investment.

==== Financial services ====
Microloans, made famous by the Grameen Bank, is where small amounts of money are loaned to borrowers who typically lack collateral, steady employment, or a verifiable credit history.. However, microlending has been criticized for making hyperprofits off the poor even from its founder, Muhammad Yunus, and in India, Arundhati Roy asserts that some 250,000 debt-ridden farmers have been driven to suicide.

Those in poverty place more importance on having a safe place to save money than on receiving loans. Additionally, a large part of microfinance loans are spent not on investments but on products that would usually be paid by a checking or savings account. A large portion of the poor are unbanked because it is often not profitable to open bank accounts for the poor. One altervative option is the postal savings system. Another option is mobile banking which utilizes the wide availability of mobile phones. This usually involves a network of agents of mostly shopkeepers who would take deposits in cash and translate these onto an account on customers&#x27; phones. Cash transfers can be done between phones and issued back in cash with a small commission, making remittances safer. Central bank digital currencies could allow, even in areas without internet access, digital transactions with little or no cost using simple feature phones.

==== Education and vocational training ====

Free education through public education or charitable organizations rather than through tuition, from early childhood education through the tertiary level provides children from low-income families who may not otherwise have the financial resources with better job prospects and higher earnings and promotes social mobility. Job training and vocational education programs that target training in technical skills in specific industries or occupations that are in high demand can reduce poverty and wealth concentration.

Strategies to provide education cost effectively include deworming children, which costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl absenteeism could be cut in half by simply providing free sanitary towels. Paying for school meals is argued to be an efficient strategy in increasing school enrollment, reducing absenteeism and increasing student attention.

Desirable actions such as enrolling children in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a form of aid known as conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families to stay at home rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.

== Obstacles ==
Economist William Easterly diagnoses a problem with the traditional approach to poverty reduction, whose advocates he calls &quot;Planners.&quot; He notes that $2.3 trillion were spent on foreign aid in five decades, yet twelve-cent medicines were not able to be given to children to prevent malaria-related deaths and three dollars were not given to new mothers to help prevent millions of child deaths. He argues that even though the aid was well-meaning, it failed to bring results because &quot;Planners,&quot; and not &quot;Searchers,&quot; are supplying it.
==Antipoverty institutions==
===Intergovernmental organizations===

In 2015 all UN Member States adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as part of the Post-2015 Development Agenda, which sought to create a future global development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals, which were goals set in 2000 and were meant to be achieved by 2015. Most targets are to be achieved by 2030, although some have no end date. Goal 1 is to &quot;end poverty in all its forms everywhere&quot;. It aims to eliminate extreme poverty for all people measured by daily wages less than $1.25 and at least half the total number of men, women, and children living in poverty. In addition, social protection systems must be established at the national level and equal access to economic resources must be ensured. Strategies have to be developed at the national, regional and international levels to support the eradication of poverty.

===Development banks===

A &quot;development financial institution&quot;, also known as a &quot;development bank&quot;, is a financial institution that provides risk capital for economic development projects on a non-commercial basis. They are often established and owned by governments to finance projects that would otherwise not be able to get financing from commercial lenders. These include international financial institutions such as the World Bank, which is the largest development bank.

===Nongovernmental organizations===

In recent decades, the number of nongovernmental organizations has increased dramatically. The High level forums on aid effectiveness that was coordinated by the OECD found that this leads to fragmentation where too many agencies were financing too many small projects using too many different procedures and that the civil service of the donor countries were overstretched producing reports for each.

A major proportion of aid from donor nations is tied, mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the donor country. US law requires food aid be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on transport. Domestic NGOs have more expertise in their respective regions and have less overhead and thus tend to be more efficient in delivering aid but receive less funding. Housing only for a Western aid worker in Ethiopia is enough to pay the salaries of four or five local NGO workers, for example. Bilateral government aid programs such as US Agency for International Development aim to increase their share of funding to go through &#x27;local partners&#x27;, called &#x27;localizing&#x27;. The obstacles include accountability where it is easier to delegate responsibility for spending on one international NGO than having to track tax payer money going to numerous smaller domestic NGOs.

===For-profit institutions===
The &quot;Poverty industrial complex&quot; refers to for-profit companies taking over roles previously held by government agencies. The incentive for profit in such companies has been argued to interfere with efficiently providing the needed services. Aid from richer nations increasingly go through for profit institutions. Such hospitals are found to imprison patients and retain corpses for non-payment of fees.

==Causes==
The cause of poverty is a highly ideologically charged subject, as different causes point to different remedies. Very broadly speaking, the socialist tradition locates the roots of poverty in problems of distribution and the use of the means of production as capital benefiting individuals, and calls for redistribution of wealth as the solution, whereas the neoliberal school of thought holds that creating conditions for profitable private investment is the solution. Neoliberal think tanks have received extensive funding, and proponents of neoliberalism have been able to apply their ideas in highly indebted countries in the global South as a condition for receiving emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund.

The existence of inequality is in part due to a set of self-reinforcing behaviors that all together constitute one aspect of the cycle of poverty. These behaviors, in addition to unfavorable, external circumstances, also explain the existence of the Matthew effect, which not only exacerbates existing inequality, but is more likely to make it multigenerational. Widespread, multigenerational poverty is an important contributor to civil unrest and political instability. For example, Raghuram G. Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, has blamed the ever-widening gulf between the rich and the poor, especially in the US, to be one of the main fault lines which caused the financial institutions to pump money into subprime mortgages—on political behest, as a palliative and not a remedy, for poverty—causing the financial crisis of 2007–2009. In Rajan&#x27;s view the main cause of the increasing gap between high income and low income earners was lack of equal access to higher education for the latter.

Several studies have found a relationship between poverty reduction and good governance. A number of articles have found linkages between poverty reduction and good governance. Some find that economic growth is more impactful at reducing poverty in well governed countries. Others find that there is a direct effect of governance on poverty reduction. Research also finds that governance above a certain level contributes to poverty reduction. Others still find a relationship between governance and poverty even controlling for economic growth, indicating an independent association. A data based scientific empirical research, which studied the impact of dynastic politics on the level of poverty of the provinces, found a positive correlation between dynastic politics and poverty; i.e. the higher proportion of dynastic politicians in power in a province leads to higher poverty rate. There is significant evidence that these political dynasties use their political dominance over their respective regions to enrich themselves, using methods such as graft or outright bribery of legislators. 

Most economic historians believe that throughout most of human history, extreme poverty was the norm for roughly 90% of the population, and only with the emergence of industrialization in the 19th century were the masses of people lifted out of it. This narrative is advanced by, among others, Martin Ravallion, Nicholas Kristof, and Steven Pinker.

Some academics, including Dylan Sullivan and Jason Hickel have challenged this contemporary mainstream narrative on poverty, arguing that extreme poverty was not the norm throughout human history, but emerged during &quot;periods of severe social and economic dislocation&quot;, including high European feudalism and the apex of the Roman Empire, and that it expanded significantly after 1500 with the emergence of colonialism and the beginnings of capitalism, stating that &quot;the expansion of the capitalist world-system caused a dramatic and prolonged process of impoverishment on a scale unparalleled in recorded history.&quot; Sullivan and Hickel assert that only with the rise of anti-colonial and socialist political movements in the 20th century did human welfare begin to see significant improvement. However, all scholars and intellectuals, including Hickel, agree that the incomes of the poorest people in the world have increased since 1981. Nevertheless, Sullivan and Hickel argue that poverty persists under contemporary global capitalism (in spite of it being highly productive) because masses of working people are cut off from common land and resources, have no ownership or control over the means of production, and have their labor power &quot;appropriated by a ruling class or an external imperial power,&quot; thereby maintaining extreme inequality.

Marian L. Tupy, a senior fellow of the Cato Institute, a right-libertarian think tank, criticized Hickel&#x27;s claim that people before industrialization lived well without a lot of monetary income, stating that &quot;The evidence from contemporary accounts and academic research&quot; shows that &quot;Compared to today, Western European living standards prior to industrialization were miserably low.&quot;, that &quot;poverty was widespread and it was precisely the onset of industrialization and global trade … which led to poverty alleviation first in the West and then in the Rest.&quot; and that both Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, while advocating for socialism, recognized that the capitalist system developing around them had improved people&#x27;s material conditions.

==Ethics==
===Human rights===
It is sometimes argued that poverty is a violation of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights state that “Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security.”

===Environmentalism===

The poor tend to suffer most from environmental degradation caused by reckless exploitation of natural resources by the rich. For example, it is estimated that 92% of accumulated greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to countries from the Global North while 8% of emissions are attributed to countries from the Global South. However, developing countries suffer 99% of the casualties attributable to climate change. This unfair distribution of environmental burdens and benefits has generated the global environmental justice and climate justice movement.

The Brundtland Report concluded that poverty causes environmental degradation, while other theories like environmentalism of the poor conclude that the global poor may be the most important force for sustainability. A 2013 World Bank report estimated that climate change was likely to hinder future attempts to reduce poverty with a 2016 UN report claiming that by 2030, an additional 122 million more people could be driven to extreme poverty because of climate change. The possible impacts of a temperature rise of 2 °C include: regular food shortages in Sub-Saharan Africa; a deficiency in water availability, with droughts predicted to happen much faster and last longer; degradation and loss of reefs in South East Asia, resulting in reduced fish stocks; and coastal communities and cities more vulnerable to increasingly violent storms. 

Green imperialism is the term used to refer to influencing poorer nations in the name of environmentalism. Green colonialism is grabbing of land in the name of environmentalism. Fortress conservation is the conservation model based on the belief that biodiversity protection is best achieved by creating protected areas in isolation from humans and this has led to the eviction of indigenous people.

===Spirituality===

Among some individuals, poverty is considered a necessary or desirable condition, which must be embraced to reach certain spiritual, moral, or intellectual states. Poverty is often understood to be an essential element of renunciation in religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism (only for monks, not for lay persons) and Jainism, whilst in Christianity, in particular Roman Catholicism, it is one of the evangelical counsels. Some Christian communities, such as the Simple Way, the Bruderhof, and the Amish value voluntary poverty; some even take a vow of poverty, similar to that of the traditional Catholic orders, in order to live a more complete life of discipleship. Another example is mendicancy, where one chooses to rely chiefly or exclusively on alms to survive. The main aim of giving up things of the materialistic world is to withdraw oneself from sensual pleasures (as they are considered illusionary and only temporary in some religions—such as the concept of dunya in Islam).

Pope Paul VI referred to &quot;the spirit of poverty&quot; as a fundamental characteristic of a Christian life, while Pope Benedict XVI distinguished between &quot;poverty &quot;chosen&quot;&quot; (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and &quot;poverty &quot;to be fought&quot;&quot; (unjust and imposed poverty).

Voluntary poverty can also be the result of solidarity with the poor. Benedict XVI considered that such solidarity is a necessary condition to fight effectively to eradicate the non-voluntary poverty.

<doc id="64961" wikidata="Q2436817" url="?curid=64961" title="Titan (board game)">
<text>Titan is a fantasy board game for two to six players, designed by Jason B. McAllister and David A. Trampier. Each player controls an army of mythological creatures such as gargoyles, unicorns, and griffons, led by a single titan. The titan is analogous to the king in chess in that the death of a titan eliminates that player and his entire army from the game. The player controlling the last remaining titan wins the game. The game was first published in 1980 by &quot;Gorgonstar&quot;; the rights were later licensed to &quot;Avalon Hill&quot; and &quot;Valley Games&quot;. Upon its release, the game received positive reviews.

==Background==
&quot;Titan&quot; was first published in 1980 by &quot;Gorgonstar&quot;, a small company created by the designers. Soon afterward, the rights were licensed to &quot;Avalon Hill&quot;, which made several minor revisions and published the game for many years. &quot;Titan&quot; went out of print in 1998, when &quot;Avalon Hill&quot; was sold and ceased operations. A new edition of &quot;Titan&quot;, with artwork by Kurt Miller and Mike Doyle and produced by Canadian publisher &quot;Valley Games&quot; became available in late 2008. The Valley Games edition was adapted to the Apple iPad and released on December 21, 2011.

==Gameplay==
The main game board consists of 96 interlocking hexes, each with a specified terrain type and color.

Each player&#x27;s army is organized into &quot;legions&quot; of one to seven creature tokens stacked face down. The legions move according to die roll, subject to restrictions marked on the board—Most board spaces can only be entered or exited from certain directions. No two legions may occupy the same hex on the game board.

If a legion moves into a hex which is occupied by an enemy legion, the two legions must fight to the death on a tactical map specific to that terrain. The terrain usually gives a battle advantage to creatures native there.

Each time a legion moves, it may recruit one additional creature if the territory to which it moves is native to at least one creature already in the legion. For example, centaurs may recruit in the plains and woods, ogres may recruit in the marsh and hills.

Each creature may recruit its own kind, but multiple weak creatures may be eligible to recruit more powerful creatures. For example, one ogre in the marsh or hills may recruit only another ogre, but two ogres in the marsh may recruit a troll, while three ogres in the hills may recruit a minotaur.

The victor of each battle is awarded points based on strength of the creatures vanquished. For each hundred points a player earns, he is awarded an angel, a strong creature which can teleport from its own legion to aid an attacking legion in future battles. Also, for each one hundred points a player earns, his titan becomes stronger in battle. Finally, at four hundred points, a player&#x27;s titan gains the ability to teleport on a roll of six, attacking any enemy legion regardless of position.

==Strategy==
Designer McAllister writes of the importance of blocking in &quot;Titan&quot; and arranging one&#x27;s legions in a defensive position to prevent another player from easy movement of recruiting. There are a variety of general strategies players use to traverse the map with their legions. One example of this is what McCallister calls &quot;the caravan&quot;, which is keeping legions following each other on the outer ring of map spaces where they can protect and support each other. Given that the outer ring is not the most desirable place for recruiting, the Caravan is usually used as a short term strategy for protecting forces until a better recruiting area can be found.

Writer Gerald Lientz emphasizes that the main strategic rule of movement is to keep one&#x27;s enemies in front of you at all times. Since the movement system often allows movement in one direction but not another, the worst situation a player can find oneself in is one in which an opponent can follow one&#x27;s legions with no risk of retaliation.

Unlike many wargames, players are not allowed to examine opposing enemy forces (they are hidden under legion markers) until they engage them in battle. This secrecy allows opportunities for deception and bluffing.

==Reception==
In the November 1980 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (No. 33) Jerry Epperson commented that &quot;If you don&#x27;t mind having a fragile, &#x27;blood-bath&#x27; game in your collection, &quot;Titan&quot; is definitely for you. If you do not care for slaughter-type games, the &quot;Titan&quot; will be a little rough, especially for [the price].&quot;

In the April 1981 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (No. 48), Bill Fawcett found the production values of the first edition produced by GorgonStar were questionable, especially the playing pieces silk-screened with a water-soluble ink that came off on fingers as they were handled. But he found the game itself &quot;is a very sophisticated fantasy game with original ideas, clearly written rules and a very playable game system.&quot; He did note that the game was not perfect. &quot;Play occasionally gets bogged down. This is especially true in games where everyone plays conservatively and avoids battles, which will commonly occur the first few times new players try the game.&quot; Fawcett concluded that &quot;All in all, &quot;Titan&quot; is far higher in quality than were the first efforts some companies that are now major manufacturers.&quot;

In the December 1982 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (No. 58), Paul Manz commented that &quot;&quot;Titan&quot; is a refreshing change from involved FRP games. For those of you who haven&#x27;t tried a fantasy game, &quot;Titan&quot; is a good one to start out with.&quot;

Charles Vasey reviewed &quot;Titan&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #46, and stated that &quot;The game is not only tightly designed, it is pretty vicious. If you go into a fight, then only one side can survive, and if the attacker does not win within a certain time-frame in each battle he is defeated.&quot;

In the October 1983 edition of &quot;Imagine&quot;, Paul Cockburn stated that &quot;in the end, you have an abstracted wargame, attractively packaged, in which the pieces do represent something, as in chess, but where this has no importance to the playing of the game, just to its &quot;feel&quot;. And &quot;Titan&quot; has a very good feel to it indeed. It is the best boardgame I have come across for a while.&quot;

In Issue 4 of &quot;AGS&quot;, Deke Young noted that the game &quot;is both easy to learn and impossible to master. A player can build up a tremendous position yet still be eliminated as quickly by another player.&quot; Young called the movement rules &quot;hard to understand at first&quot; but concluded, &quot;&quot;Titan&quot; is a game every gamer can enjoy.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;Titan&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, John ONeill said &quot;There are classic fantasy games and there are classic fantasy games. Jai Kamani and David A. Trampier&#x27;s &quot;Titan&quot;, a massive game of conflict between mythological armies of ogres, unicorns, griffons, and other creatures, was perhaps the most ubiquitous fantasy game of my youth.&quot;

<doc id="64962" wikidata="Q100937" url="?curid=64962" title="Fred Astaire">
<text>Fred Astaire (born Frederick Austerlitz, May 10, 1899 – June 22, 1987) was an American dancer, actor, singer, musician, choreographer, and presenter, whose career in stage, film, and television spanned 76 years. He is widely regarded as the &quot;greatest popular-music dancer of all time&quot; He received an Honorary Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Grammy Award.

As a dancer, he was known for his uncanny sense of rhythm, creativity, effortless presentation, and tireless perfectionism, which was sometimes a burden to co-workers. His dancing showed elegance, grace, originality, and precision. He drew influences from many sources, including tap, classical dance, and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle. His trademark style greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance. He called his eclectic approach &quot;outlaw style&quot;, a following an unpredictable and instinctive muse. His motion was economical, yet endlessly nuanced. 

Astaire&#x27;s most memorable dancing partnership was with Ginger Rogers, with whom he co-starred in 10 Hollywood musicals during the classic age of Hollywood cinema, including &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), and &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937). Astaire&#x27;s fame grew in films like &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942), &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957), and &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; (1957). For his performance in John Guillermin&#x27;s disaster film, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), Astaire received his only competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

Astaire received several honors including an Academy Honorary Award in 1950, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1960, the Film Society of Lincoln Center tribute in 1973, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1978, and AFI Life Achievement Award in 1980. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1972, and the Television Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Astaire the fifth-greatest male star of Classic Hollywood cinema in 100 Years... 100 Stars.

==Life and career==
===1899–1916: Early life and career===
Fred Astaire was born Frederick Austerlitz on May 10, 1899 in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of Johanna &quot;Ann&quot; (née Geilus; 1878–1975) and Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Emanuel Austerlitz (1868–1923), known in the U.S. as Frederic Austerlitz. Astaire&#x27;s mother was born in the U.S. to Lutheran German immigrants from East Prussia and Alsace. Astaire&#x27;s father was born in Linz in Upper Austria, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to Catholic parents who had converted from Judaism.

Astaire&#x27;s father Fritz Austerlitz arrived in New York City at the age of 25 on October 26, 1893 at Ellis Island. Fritz was seeking work in the brewing trade and moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he was employed by the Storz Brewing Company. Astaire&#x27;s mother dreamed of escaping Omaha by means of her children&#x27;s talents. Astaire&#x27;s older sister Adele was an instinctive dancer and singer early in her childhood. Johanna planned a brother-and-sister act, common in vaudeville at the time, for her two children. Although Fred refused dance lessons at first, he easily mimicked his older sister&#x27;s steps and learned piano, accordion and clarinet.

When their father lost his job, the family moved to New York City in January 1905 to launch the show business careers of the children. They began training at the Alvieni Master School of the Theatre and Academy of Cultural Arts. Fred and Adele&#x27;s mother suggested that they change their name to Astaire, as she felt that Austerlitz was reminiscent of the Battle of Austerlitz. Family legend attributes the name to an uncle surnamed L&#x27;Astaire.

The children were taught dance, speaking and singing in preparation for developing an act. Their first act was called &quot;Juvenile Artists Presenting an Electric Musical Toe-Dancing Novelty&quot;. Astaire wore a top hat and tails in the first half and a lobster outfit in the second. In an interview, Astaire&#x27;s daughter Ava Astaire McKenzie, observed that he was often given a top hat to make him look taller. In November 1905, the comedic act debuted in Keyport, New Jersey at a &quot;tryout theater.&quot; The local paper wrote that &quot;the Astaires are the greatest child act in vaudeville.&quot;

As a result of their father&#x27;s salesmanship, Fred and Adele Astaire landed a major contract and played the Orpheum Circuit in the Midwest, West and some Southern cities in the U.S. Soon Adele grew to at least three inches taller than Fred, and the pair began to look incongruous. The family decided to take a two-year break from show business to let time take its course and to avoid trouble from the Gerry Society and the child-labor laws of the time. In 1912, Astaire became an Episcopalian. The career of the Astaire siblings resumed with mixed fortunes, but with increasing skill and polish, as they began to incorporate tap dancing into their act. From vaudeville dancer Aurelio Coccia they learned the tango, waltz and other ballroom dances popularized by Vernon and Irene Castle. Some sources state that the Astaire siblings appeared in a 1915 film titled &quot;Fanchon, the Cricket&quot;, starring Mary Pickford, but the Astaires have consistently denied this.

By age 14, Astaire had assumed the musical responsibilities for their act. He first met George Gershwin, who was working as a song plugger for Jerome H. Remick&#x27;s music publishing company, in 1916. Astaire had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas. Their chance meeting was to affect the careers of both artists profoundly. Astaire was always on the lookout for new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his quest for novelty and perfection.

===1917–1933: Stage career on Broadway and in London===

The Astaires broke into Broadway in 1917 with &quot;Over the Top&quot;, a patriotic revue, and performed for U.S. and Allied troops at this time as well. They followed up with several more shows. Of their work in &quot;The Passing Show of 1918&quot;, Heywood Broun wrote: &quot;In an evening in which there was an abundance of good dancing, Fred Astaire stood out ... He and his partner, Adele Astaire, made the show pause early in the evening with a beautiful loose-limbed dance.&quot;

Adele&#x27;s sparkle and humor drew much of the attention, owing in part to Fred&#x27;s careful preparation and sharp supporting choreography. She still set the tone of their act but by this time, Astaire&#x27;s dancing skill was beginning to outshine his sister&#x27;s.

During the 1920s, Fred and Adele appeared on Broadway and the London stage. They won popular acclaim with the theater crowd on both sides of the Atlantic in shows such as Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;The Bunch and Judy&quot; (1922), George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Lady, Be Good&quot; (1924), and &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1927) and later in &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1931). Astaire&#x27;s tap dancing was recognized by then as among the best. For example, Robert Benchley wrote in 1930, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that I will plunge the nation into war by stating that Fred is the greatest tap-dancer in the world.&quot; While in London, Fred studied piano at the Guildhall School of Music alongside his friend and colleague Noël Coward, and in 1926, was one of the judges at the &#x27;Charleston Championship of the World &#x27; competition at the Royal Albert Hall, where Lew Grade was declared the winner.

After the close of &quot;Funny Face&quot;, the Astaires went to Hollywood for a screen test (now lost) at Paramount Pictures, but Paramount deemed them unsuitable for films.

They split in 1932 when Adele married her first husband, Lord Charles Cavendish, the second son of the 9th Duke of Devonshire. Fred went on to achieve success on his own on Broadway and in London with &quot;Gay Divorce&quot; (later made into the film &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot;) while considering offers from Hollywood. The end of the partnership was traumatic for Astaire but stimulated him to expand his range.

Free of the brother-sister constraints of the former pairing and working with new partner Claire Luce, Fred created a romantic partnered dance to Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot;, which had been written for &quot;Gay Divorce&quot;. Luce stated that she had to encourage him to take a more romantic approach: &quot;Come on, Fred, I&#x27;m not your sister, you know.&quot; The success of the stage play was credited to this number, and when recreated in &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; (1934), the film version of the play, it ushered in a new era in filmed dance. Recently, film footage taken by Fred Stone of Astaire performing in &quot;Gay Divorce&quot; with Luce&#x27;s successor, Dorothy Stone, in New York in 1933 was uncovered by dancer and historian Betsy Baytos and now represents the earliest known performance footage of Astaire.

===1933–1939: Astaire and Ginger Rogers at RKO===

According to Hollywood folklore, a screen test report on Astaire for RKO Radio Pictures, now lost along with the test, is reported to have read: &quot;Can&#x27;t sing. Can&#x27;t act. Balding. Can dance a little.&quot; The producer of the Astaire–Rogers pictures, Pandro S. Berman, claimed he had never heard the story in the 1930s and that it only emerged years afterward. Astaire later clarified, insisting that the report had read: &quot;Can&#x27;t act. Slightly bald. &quot;Also dances&quot;.&quot; In any case, the test was clearly disappointing, and David O. Selznick, who had signed Astaire to RKO and commissioned the test, stated in a memo, &quot;I am uncertain about the man, but I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is so tremendous that it comes through even on this wretched test.&quot;

However, this did not affect RKO&#x27;s plans for Astaire. They lent him for a few days to MGM in 1933 for his significant Hollywood debut in the successful musical film &quot;Dancing Lady&quot;. In the movie, he appeared as himself dancing with Joan Crawford. On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth-billed Ginger Rogers in the 1933 Dolores del Río vehicle &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;. In a review, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire&#x27;s presence:

The main point of &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; is the screen promise of Fred Astaire ... He&#x27;s assuredly a bet after this one, for he&#x27;s distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer, he remains in a class by himself. The latter observation will be no news to the profession, which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.

Having already been linked to his sister Adele on stage, Astaire was initially very reluctant to become part of another dance team. He wrote his agent, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind making another picture with her, but as for this &#x27;team&#x27; idea, it&#x27;s &#x27;out!&#x27; I&#x27;ve just managed to live down one partnership and I don&#x27;t want to be bothered with any more.&quot; However, he was persuaded by the apparent public appeal of the Astaire–Rogers pairing. The partnership, and the choreography of Astaire and Hermes Pan, helped make dancing an important element of the Hollywood film musical.

Astaire and Rogers made nine films together at RKO: &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933), &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; (1934), &quot;Roberta&quot; (1935, in which Astaire also demonstrates his oft-overlooked piano skills with a spirited solo on &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance&quot;), &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936), &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937), &quot;Carefree&quot; (1938), and &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot; (1939). Six out of the nine Astaire–Rogers musicals became the biggest moneymakers for RKO; all of the films brought a certain prestige and artistry that all studios coveted at the time. Their partnership elevated them both to stardom; as Katharine Hepburn reportedly said, &quot;He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.&quot; 
Astaire received a percentage of the films&#x27; profits, something scarce in actors&#x27; contracts at that time.

====Innovations====
Astaire revolutionized dance on film by having complete autonomy over its presentation. He is credited with two important innovations in early film musicals. First, he insisted that a closely tracking dolly camera film a dance routine in as few shots as possible, typically with just four to eight cuts, while holding the dancers in full view at all times. This gave the illusion of an almost stationary camera filming an entire dance in a single shot. Astaire famously quipped: &quot;Either the camera will dance, or I will.&quot; Astaire maintained this policy from &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; in 1934 until his last film musical, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in 1968, when director Francis Ford Coppola overruled him.

Astaire&#x27;s style of dance sequences allowed the viewer to follow the dancers and choreography in their entirety. This style differed strikingly from those in the Busby Berkeley musicals. Those musicals&#x27; sequences were filled with extravagant aerial shots, dozens of cuts for quick takes, and zooms on areas of the body such as a chorus row of arms or legs.

Astaire&#x27;s second innovation involved the context of the dance; he was adamant that all song and dance routines be integral to the plotlines of the film. Instead of using dance as a spectacle as Busby Berkeley did, Astaire used it to move the plot along. Typically, an Astaire picture would include at least three standard dances. One would be a solo performance by Astaire, which he termed his &quot;sock solo&quot;. Another would be a partnered comedy dance routine. Finally, he would include a partnered romantic dance routine.

====Assessment of the Rogers partnership====

Dance commentators Arlene Croce, Hannah Hyam and John Mueller consider Rogers to have been Astaire&#x27;s greatest dance partner, a view shared by Hermes Pan and Stanley Donen. Film critic Pauline Kael adopts a more neutral stance, while &quot;Time&quot; magazine film critic Richard Schickel writes &quot;The nostalgia surrounding Rogers–Astaire tends to bleach out other partners.&quot;

Mueller sums up Rogers&#x27;s abilities as follows:

Rogers was outstanding among Astaire&#x27;s partners not because she was superior to others as a dancer, but because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began ... the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable.

According to Astaire, &quot;Ginger had never danced with a partner before &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;. She faked it an awful lot. She couldn&#x27;t tap and she couldn&#x27;t do this and that ... but Ginger had style and talent and improved as she went along. She got so that after a while everyone else who danced with me looked wrong.&quot; On p. 162 of his book &quot;Ginger: Salute to a Star&quot;, author Dick Richards quotes Astaire saying to Raymond Rohauer, curator of the New York Gallery of Modern Art, &quot;Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually, she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success.&quot;

In 1976, British talk-show host Michael Parkinson asked Astaire who his favorite dancing partner was, on &quot;Parkinson&quot;. At first, Astaire refused to answer but ultimately he said &quot;Excuse me, I must say Ginger was certainly, [uh, uh,] the one. You know, the most effective partner I ever had. Everyone knows.&quot;

Rogers described Astaire&#x27;s uncompromising standards extending to the whole production: &quot;Sometimes he&#x27;ll think of a new line of dialogue or a new angle for the story ... they never know what time of night he&#x27;ll call up and start ranting enthusiastically about a fresh idea ... No loafing on the job on an Astaire picture, and no cutting corners.&quot;

Despite their success, Astaire was unwilling to have his career tied exclusively to any partnership. He negotiated with RKO to strike out on his own with &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; in 1937 with an inexperienced, non-dancing Joan Fontaine, unsuccessfully as it turned out. He returned to make two more films with Rogers, &quot;Carefree&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot; (1939). While both films earned respectable gross incomes, they both lost money because of increased production costs, and Astaire left RKO after being labeled &quot;box office poison&quot; by the &quot;Independent Theatre Owners of America&quot;. Astaire was reunited with Rogers in 1949 at MGM for their final outing, &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot;, the only one of their films together to be shot in Technicolor.

===1940–1947: &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;, early retirement ===
Astaire left RKO in 1939 to freelance and pursue new film opportunities, with mixed though generally successful outcomes. Throughout this period, Astaire continued to value the input of choreographic collaborators. Unlike the 1930s when he worked almost exclusively with Hermes Pan, he tapped the talents of other choreographers to innovate continually. His first post-Ginger dance partner was the redoubtable Eleanor Powell, considered the most exceptional female tap-dancer of her generation. They starred in &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot;, in which they performed a celebrated extended dance routine to Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;. In his autobiography &quot;Steps in Time&quot;, Astaire remarked, &quot;She &#x27;put &#x27;em down&#x27; like a man, no ricky-ticky-sissy stuff with Ellie. She really knocked out a tap dance in a class by herself.&quot;

He played alongside Bing Crosby in &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942) and later &quot;Blue Skies&quot; (1946). But, in spite of the enormous financial success of both, he was reportedly dissatisfied with roles where he lost the girl to Crosby. The former film is memorable for his virtuoso solo dance to &quot;Let&#x27;s Say it with Firecrackers&quot;. The latter film featured &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot;, an innovative song-and-dance routine indelibly associated with him. Other partners during this period included Paulette Goddard in &quot;Second Chorus&quot; (1940), in which he dance-conducted the Artie Shaw orchestra.
He made two pictures with Rita Hayworth. The first film, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; (1941), catapulted Hayworth to stardom. In the movie, Astaire integrated for the third time Latin American dance idioms into his style (the first being with Ginger Rogers in &quot;The Carioca&quot; number from &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933) and the second, again with Rogers, was the &quot;Dengozo&quot; dance from &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot; (1939). His second film with Hayworth, &quot;You Were Never Lovelier&quot; (1942), was equally successful. It featured a duet to Kern&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Old Fashioned&quot;, which became the centerpiece of Jerome Robbins&#x27;s 1983 New York City Ballet tribute to Astaire.

He next appeared opposite the seventeen-year-old Joan Leslie in the wartime comedy &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (1943). In it, he introduced Arlen and Mercer&#x27;s &quot;One for My Baby&quot; while dancing on a bar counter in a dark and troubled routine. Astaire choreographed this film alone and achieved modest box office success. It represented a notable departure for Astaire from his usual charming, happy-go-lucky screen persona, and confused contemporary critics.

His next partner, Lucille Bremer, was featured in two lavish vehicles, both directed by Vincente Minnelli. The fantasy &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot; (1945) featured an avant-garde surrealistic ballet. In the musical revue &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1945), Astaire danced with Gene Kelly to the Gershwin song &quot;The Babbit and the Bromide&quot;, a song Astaire had introduced with his sister Adele back in 1927. While &quot;Follies&quot; was a hit, &quot;Yolanda&quot; bombed at the box office.

Always insecure and believing his career was beginning to falter, Astaire surprised his audiences by announcing his retirement during the production of his next film, &quot;Blue Skies&quot; (1946). He nominated &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot; as his farewell dance. He then concentrated on his horse-racing interests and in 1947 founded the Fred Astaire Dance Studios, which he subsequently sold in 1966.

===1948–1957: MGM films and second retirement===

Astaire&#x27;s retirement did not last long. He returned to the big screen to replace an injured Gene Kelly in &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948) opposite Judy Garland, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford. He followed up with a final reunion with Rogers (replacing Judy Garland) in &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (1949). Both of these films revived Astaire&#x27;s popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals. &quot;Three Little Words&quot; with Vera-Ellen and Red Skelton was for MGM. &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; with Betty Hutton was on loan-out to Paramount. While &quot;Three Little Words&quot; did quite well at the box office, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was a financial disappointment. &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; (1951) with Jane Powell and Peter Lawford proved to be very successful, but &quot;The Belle of New York&quot; (1952) with Vera-Ellen was a critical and box-office disaster. &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953) received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds. However, because of its high cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release.

Soon after, Astaire, along with most of the other remaining stars at MGM, was dismissed by the studio due to the advent of television and the streamlining of film production. In 1954, Astaire was about to start work on a new musical, &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; (1955) with Leslie Caron at 20th Century-Fox. Then, his wife Phyllis became ill and died of lung cancer. Astaire was so desolate that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket. However, Johnny Mercer, the film&#x27;s composer, and Fox studio executives convinced him that continuing to work would be the best thing for him. &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; was only moderately successful at the box office. His next film for Paramount, &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957), teamed him with Audrey Hepburn and Kay Thompson. Despite the sumptuousness of the production and the good reviews from critics, the movie failed to recover its cost. Astaire&#x27;s next film, &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; (1957), in which he co-starred with Cyd Charisse and his final musical for MGM, also lost money at the box office.

Afterward, Astaire announced that he was retiring from dancing in films. His legacy at this point was 30 musical films in 25 years.

===1957–1981: Television specials, serious roles ===

Astaire did not retire from dancing altogether. He made a series of four highly rated Emmy Award-winning musical specials for television in 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1968. Each featured Barrie Chase, with whom Astaire enjoyed a renewed period of dance creativity. The first of these programs, 1958&#x27;s &quot;An Evening with Fred Astaire&quot;, won nine Emmy Awards, including &quot;Best Single Performance by an Actor&quot; and &quot;Most Outstanding Single Program of the Year&quot;. It was also noteworthy for being the first major broadcast to be prerecorded on color videotape. Astaire won the Emmy for Best Single Performance by an Actor. The choice had a controversial backlash because many believed his dancing in the special was not the type of &quot;acting&quot; for which the award was designed. At one point, Astaire offered to return the award, but the Television Academy refused to consider it. A restoration of the program won a technical Emmy in 1988 for Ed Reitan, Don Kent, and Dan Einstein. They restored the original videotape, transferring its contents to a modern format and filling in gaps where the tape had deteriorated with kinescope footage.

Astaire played Julian Osborne, a non-dancing character, in the nuclear war drama &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959). He was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor award for his performance, losing to Stephen Boyd in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. Astaire appeared in non-dancing roles in three other films and several television series from 1957 to 1969.

Astaire also wrote his own autobiography, titled &quot;Steps in Time&quot;, which he published in 1959.

Astaire&#x27;s last major musical film was &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1968), directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Astaire shed his white tie and tails to play an Irish rogue who believes that if he buries a crock of gold in the shadows of Fort Knox the gold will multiply. Astaire&#x27;s dance partner was Petula Clark, who played his character&#x27;s skeptical daughter. He described himself as nervous about singing with her, while she said she was worried about dancing with him. The film was a modest success both at the box office and among critics.

Astaire continued to act in the 1970s. He appeared on television as the father of Robert Wagner&#x27;s character, Alexander Mundy, in &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;. In the movie &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), he danced with Jennifer Jones and received his only Academy Award nomination, in the category of Best Supporting Actor. He voiced the mailman narrator S.D Kluger in the 1970s Rankin/Bass animated television specials &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot; and &quot;The Easter Bunny Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;. Astaire also appeared in the first two &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; documentaries, in the mid-1970s. In the second compilation, aged seventy-six, he performed brief dance linking sequences with Kelly, his last dance performances in a musical film. In the summer of 1975, he made three albums in London, &quot;Attitude Dancing&quot;, &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take These Away from Me&quot;, and &quot;A Couple of Song and Dance Men&quot;, the last an album of duets with Bing Crosby. In 1976, Astaire played a supporting role, as a dog owner, in the cult movie &quot;The Amazing Dobermans&quot;, co-starring Barbara Eden and James Franciscus, and played Dr. Seamus Scully in the French film &quot;The Purple Taxi&quot; (1977).

In 1978, he co-starred with Helen Hayes in a well received television film &quot;A Family Upside Down&quot; in which they played an elderly couple coping with failing health. Astaire won an Emmy Award for his performance. He made a well publicized guest appearance on the science-fiction television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in 1979, as Chameleon, the possible father of Starbuck, in &quot;The Man with Nine Lives&quot;, a role written for him by Donald P. Bellisario. Astaire asked his agent to obtain a role for him on &quot;Galactica&quot; because of his grandchildren&#x27;s interest in the series and the producers were delighted at the opportunity to create an entire episode to feature him. This episode marked the final time that he danced on screen, in this case with Anne Jeffreys. He acted in nine different roles in &quot;The Man in the Santa Claus Suit&quot; in 1979. His final film was the 1981 adaptation of Peter Straub&#x27;s novel &quot;Ghost Story&quot;. This horror film was also the last for two of his most prominent castmates, Melvyn Douglas and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.

== Style and influence ==
 Astaire was a virtuoso dancer, able when called for to convey light-hearted venturesomeness or deep emotion. His technical control and sense of rhythm were astonishing. Long after the photography for the solo dance number &quot;I Wanna Be a Dancin&#x27; Man&quot; was completed for the 1952 feature &quot;The Belle of New York&quot;, it was decided that Astaire&#x27;s humble costume and the threadbare stage set were inadequate and the entire sequence was reshot. The 1994 documentary &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; shows the two performances side by side in split-screen. Frame for frame, the two performances are identical, down to the subtlest gesture.

Astaire&#x27;s execution of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality, and precision. He drew from a variety of influences, including tap, classical dance, and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle. His was a uniquely recognizable dance style that greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged. He termed his eclectic approach &quot;outlaw style&quot;, an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry. His dances are economical yet endlessly nuanced. As Jerome Robbins stated, &quot;Astaire&#x27;s dancing looks so simple, so disarming, so easy, yet the understructure, the way he sets the steps on, over or against the music, is so surprising and inventive.&quot; Astaire further observed:

Although Astaire was the primary choreographer of all his dance routines, he welcomed the input of collaborators and notably his principal collaborator Hermes Pan. But dance historian John Mueller believes that Astaire acted as the lead choreographer in his solos and partnered dances throughout his career. He notes Astaire&#x27;s dance style was consistent in subsequent films made with or without the assistance of Pan. Furthermore, Astaire choreographed all the routines during his Broadway career with his sister Adele.

Frequently, a dance sequence was built around two or three key ideas, sometimes inspired by his steps or by the music itself, suggesting a particular mood or action. Caron said that while Kelly danced close to the ground, she felt like she was floating with Astaire. Many dance routines were built around a &quot;gimmick&quot;, like dancing on the walls in &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; or dancing with his shadows in &quot;Swing Time&quot;. He or his collaborator would think of these routines earlier and save them for the right situation. They would spend weeks creating all the dance sequences in a secluded rehearsal space before filming would begin. They would work with a rehearsal pianist (often the composer Hal Borne) who in turn would communicate modifications to the musical orchestrators.

His perfectionism was legendary, but his relentless insistence on rehearsals and retakes was a burden to some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As Vincente Minnelli stated, &quot;He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree of all the people in the world. He will not even go to see his rushes ... He always thinks he is no good.&quot; As Astaire himself observed, &quot;I&#x27;ve never yet got anything 100% right. Still, it&#x27;s never as bad as I think it is.&quot;

Michael Kidd, Astaire&#x27;s co-choreographer on the 1953 film &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, found that his own concern about the emotional motivation behind the dance was not shared by Astaire. Kidd later recounted: &quot;Technique was important to him. He&#x27;d say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do the steps. Let&#x27;s add the looks later. Astaire declared that his own tap heroes were the Nicholas Brothers, Fayard and Harold.

==Influence on popular song==
Extremely modest about his singing abilities (he frequently claimed that he could not sing, but the critics rated him as among the finest), Astaire introduced some of the most celebrated songs from the Great American Songbook, in particular, Cole Porter&#x27;s: &quot;Night and Day&quot; in &quot;Gay Divorce&quot; (1932); &quot;So Near and Yet So Far&quot; in &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; (1941); Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Isn&#x27;t This a Lovely Day?&quot;, &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, and &quot;Top Hat, White Tie and Tails&quot; in &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935); &quot;Let&#x27;s Face the Music and Dance&quot; in &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936); and &quot;Change Partners&quot; in &quot;Carefree&quot; (1938). He first presented Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; in &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), the Gershwins&#x27; &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot; in &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937), &quot;A Foggy Day&quot; and &quot;Nice Work if You Can Get it&quot; in &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; (1937), Johnny Mercer&#x27;s &quot;One for My Baby&quot; from &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (1943), &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; from &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; (1955); and Harry Warren and Arthur Freed&#x27;s &quot;This Heart of Mine&quot; from &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1946).
Astaire also co-introduced a number of song classics via song duets with his partners. For example, with his sister Adele, he co-introduced the Gershwins&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Build a Stairway to Paradise&quot; from &quot;Stop Flirting&quot; (1923), &quot;Fascinating Rhythm&quot; in &quot;Lady, Be Good&quot; (1924), &quot;Funny Face&quot; in &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1927), and, in duets with Ginger Rogers, he presented Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket&quot; in &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936), Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot; and &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; in &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), along with the Gershwins&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Call the Whole Thing Off&quot; from &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937). With Judy Garland, he sang Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;A Couple of Swells&quot; from &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948); and, with Jack Buchanan, Oscar Levant, and Nanette Fabray he delivered Arthur Schwartz&#x27;s and Howard Dietz&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; from &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953).

Although he possessed a light voice, he was admired for his lyricism, diction, and phrasing—the grace and elegance so prized in his dancing seemed to be reflected in his singing, a capacity for synthesis which led Burton Lane to describe him as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest musical performer&quot;. Irving Berlin considered Astaire the equal of any male interpreter of his songs—&quot;as good as Jolson, Crosby or Sinatra, not necessarily because of his voice, but for his conception of projecting a song.&quot; Jerome Kern considered him the supreme male interpreter of his songs.And while George Gershwin was somewhat critical of Astaire&#x27;s singing abilities, he wrote many of his most memorable songs for him. In his heyday, Astaire was referenced in lyrics of songwriters Cole Porter, Lorenz Hart and Eric Maschwitz and continues to inspire modern songwriters.

Astaire was a songwriter, with &quot;I&#x27;m Building Up to an Awful Letdown&quot; (written with lyricist Johnny Mercer) reaching number four in the Hit parade of 1936. He recorded his own &quot;It&#x27;s Just Like Taking Candy from a Baby&quot; with Benny Goodman in 1940 and nurtured a lifelong ambition to be a successful popular song composer.

In 1952, Astaire recorded &quot;The Astaire Story&quot;, a four-volume album with a quintet led by Oscar Peterson. The album, produced by Norman Granz, provided a musical overview of Astaire&#x27;s career. &quot;The Astaire Story&quot; later won the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, a special Grammy award to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old and that have &quot;qualitative or historical significance&quot;.

Astaire was also mentioned by the British rock band Queen in the bridge of the song &quot;Man on the Prowl&quot;, released on their 1984 album &quot;The Works&quot;.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and family ===
Astaire married 25-year-old Phyllis Potter in 1933 (formerly Phyllis Livingston Baker [1908–1954]), a Boston-born New York socialite and former wife of Eliphalet Nott Potter III (1906–1981), despite the objections of his mother and sister. Phyllis&#x27;s death from lung cancer at the age of 46 ended 21 years of marriage and left Astaire devastated. Astaire attempted to drop out of the film &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; (1955), offering to pay the production costs to date, but was persuaded to stay.

In addition to Phyllis Potter&#x27;s son, Eliphalet IV (known as Peter), the Astaires had two children, Fred, Jr. (1936), and Ava (1942). Astaire&#x27;s son appeared with him in the movie &quot;Midas Run&quot;.


On June 24, 1980, at the age of 81, he married a second time. Robyn Smith was 45 years his junior and a jockey who rode for Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. (she also dated Vanderbilt in the 1970s), and appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; on July 31, 1972.

Astaire&#x27;s life has never been portrayed on film. He always refused permission for such portrayals, saying, &quot;However much they offer me—and offers come in all the time—I shall not sell.&quot; Astaire&#x27;s will included a clause requesting that no such portrayal ever take place; he commented, &quot;It is there because I have no particular desire to have my life misinterpreted, which it would be.&quot; On December 5, 2021, Tom Holland announced that he would be portraying Astaire in an upcoming biopic.

=== Interests and beliefs ===
Intensely private, Astaire was rarely seen on the Hollywood social scene. Instead, he devoted his spare time to his family and his hobbies, which included horse racing, playing the drums, songwriting, and golfing. He was good friends with David Niven, Randolph Scott, Clark Gable and Gregory Peck. Niven described him as &quot;a pixie—timid, always warm-hearted, with a penchant for schoolboy jokes.&quot; In 1946, his horse Triplicate won the Hollywood Gold Cup and San Juan Capistrano Handicap. He remained physically active well into his eighties. He took up skateboarding in his late seventies and was awarded a life membership in the National Skateboard Society. At 78, he broke his left wrist while skateboarding in his driveway.

Always immaculately turned out, Astaire and Cary Grant were called &quot;the best-dressed actor[s] in American movies&quot;. Astaire remained a male fashion icon even into his later years, eschewing his trademark top hat, white tie, and tails, which he hated. Instead, he favored a breezy casual style of tailored sport jackets, colored shirts, and slacks—the latter usually held up by the distinctive use of an old tie or silk scarf in place of a belt.

Astaire was a Republican and a charter member of the Hollywood Republican Committee.

=== Death ===
Astaire died of pneumonia on June 22, 1987, at the age of 88. His body was buried at Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, California.

==Acting credits and accolades ==

He starred in numerous musical films such as &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; (1934), &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936), &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937), &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1952), &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (1949), &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; (1951), &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957), &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1968). He later starred in the drama &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). He also acted and hosted in several compilation films such as &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; (1974), &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot; (1976), &quot;That&#x27;s Dancing&quot; (1975), and &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; (1994).

Over his career he received several awards including a BAFTA Award, three Primetime Emmy Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. He also received several honorary awards including the Academy Honorary Award in 1950, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1960, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1970, and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1981.

<doc id="64963" wikidata="Q1631" url="?curid=64963" title="Édith Piaf">
<text>Édith Giovanna Gassion (19 December 1915 – 10 October 1963), known as Édith Piaf (), was a French singer and lyricist best known for performing songs in the cabaret and modern chanson genres. She is widely regarded as France&#x27;s greatest popular singer and one of the most celebrated performers of the 20th century.

Piaf&#x27;s music was often autobiographical, and she specialized in and torch ballads about love, loss and sorrow. Her most widely known songs include &quot;La Vie en rose&quot; (1946), &quot;Non, je ne regrette rien&quot; (1960), &quot;Hymne à l&#x27;amour&quot; (1949), &quot;Milord&quot; (1959), &quot;La Foule&quot; (1957), &quot;L&#x27;Accordéoniste&quot; (1940), and &quot;Padam, padam...&quot; (1951).

Having begun her career touring with her father at age fourteen, her fame increased during the German occupation of France and in 1945, Piaf&#x27;s signature song, &quot;La Vie en rose&quot; () was published. She became France&#x27;s most popular entertainer in the late 1940s, also touring Europe, South America and the United States, where her popularity led to eight appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot;

Piaf continued to perform, including several series of concerts at the Paris Olympia music hall, until a few months before her death in 1963 at age 47. Her last song, &quot;L&#x27;Homme de Berlin&quot;, was recorded with her husband in April 1963. Since her death, several documentaries and films have been produced about Piaf&#x27;s life as a touchstone of French culture.

== Early life ==

Despite numerous biographies, much of Piaf&#x27;s life is unknown. Her birth certificate indicates she was born in Paris on 19 December 1915, at the Hôpital Tenon hospital.

Her birth name was Édith Giovanna Gassion. The name &quot;Édith&quot; was inspired by British nurse Edith Cavell, who was executed 2 months before Édith&#x27;s birth for helping French soldiers escape from German captivity during World War I. Twenty years later, Édith&#x27;s stage surname &quot;Piaf&quot; was created by her first promoter, based on a French term for &#x27;sparrow&#x27;.

Édith&#x27;s father Louis Alphonse Gassion (1881–1944) was an acrobatic street performer from Normandy with a theater background. Louis&#x27;s father was Victor Alphonse Gassion (1850–1928) and his mother was Léontine Louise Descamps (1860–1937), who ran a brothel in Normandy and was known professionally as &quot;Maman Tine&quot;. Édith&#x27;s mother, Annetta Giovanna Maillard (1895–1945) was a singer and circus performer born in Italy who performed under the stage name &quot;Line Marsa&quot;. Annetta&#x27;s father was Auguste Eugène Maillard (1866–1912) of French descent and her grandmother was Emma (Aïcha) Saïd Ben Mohammed (1876–1930), an acrobat of Kabyle and Italian descent. Annetta and Louis divorced on 4 June 1929.

Piaf&#x27;s mother abandoned her at birth, and she lived for a short time with her maternal grandmother, Emma (Aïcha), in Bethandy, Normandy. When her father enlisted with the French Army in 1916 to fight in World War I, he took her to his mother, who ran a brothel in Bernay, Normandy. There, prostitutes helped look after Piaf. The bordello had two floors and seven rooms, and the prostitutes were not very numerous – &quot;about ten poor girls&quot;, as she later described. In fact, five or six were permanent while a dozen others would join the brothel during market days and other busy days. The sub-mistress of the brothel was called &quot;Madam Gaby&quot; and Piaf considered her almost like family; later, she became godmother of Denise Gassion, Piaf&#x27;s half-sister born in 1931.

From the age of three to seven, Piaf was allegedly blind as a result of keratitis. According to one of her biographers, she recovered her sight after her grandmother&#x27;s prostitutes pooled money to accompany her on a pilgrimage honouring Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Piaf claimed this resulted in a miraculous healing.

== Career ==
=== 1929–1939 ===
At age 14, Piaf was taken by her father to join him in his acrobatic street performances all over France, where she first began to sing in public. The following year, Piaf met Simone &quot;Mômone&quot; Berteaut, who became a companion for most of her life. Berteaut later falsely represented herself as Piaf&#x27;s half-sister in a memoir. Together they toured the streets singing and earning money for themselves. With the additional money Piaf earned as part of an acrobatic trio, she and Berteaut were able to rent their own place. Piaf took a room at the &quot;Grand Hôtel de Clermont&quot; in Paris and worked with Berteaut as a street singer around Paris and its suburbs.

Piaf met a young man named Louis Dupont in 1932 and lived with him for a time; she became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, Marcelle &quot;Cécelle&quot; Dupont, on 11 February 1933, when Piaf was seventeen. After Piaf&#x27;s relationship with Dupont ended, Marcelle, who had been living with her father, contracted meningitis and died in July 1935, aged two.

In 1935, Piaf was discovered by nightclub owner Louis Leplée. Leplée persuaded Piaf (then known by her birth name of Édith Gassion) to sing despite her extreme nervousness. This nervousness and her height of only , inspired Leplée to give her the nickname &quot;La Môme Piaf&quot;, which is Paris slang for &quot;The Sparrow Kid&quot;. Leplée taught Piaf about stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, which became her trademark apparel.

Prior to Piaf&#x27;s opening night, Leplée ran an intense publicity campaign, resulting in the attendance of many celebrities. The bandleader that evening was Django Reinhardt, with his pianist, Norbert Glanzberg. Her nightclub gigs led to her first two records produced that same year, with one of them penned by Marguerite Monnot, a collaborator throughout Piaf&#x27;s life and one of her favourite composers.

On 6 April 1936, Leplée was murdered. Piaf was questioned and accused as an accessory, but acquitted. Leplée had been killed by mobsters with previous ties to Piaf. A barrage of negative media attention now threatened Piaf&#x27;s career. To rehabilitate her image, she recruited Raymond Asso, with whom she would become romantically involved. He changed her stage name to &quot;Édith Piaf&quot;, barred undesirable acquaintances from seeing her, and commissioned Monnot to write songs that reflected or alluded to Piaf&#x27;s previous life on the streets.

=== 1940–1944 ===

In 1940, Piaf co-starred in Jean Cocteau&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Le Bel Indifférent&quot;.

Piaf&#x27;s career and fame gained momentum during the German occupation of France in World War II. She began forming friendships with prominent people, such as actor and singer Maurice Chevalier and poet Jacques Bourgeat. Piaf also performed in various nightclubs and brothels, which flourished between 1940 and 1945. Various top Paris brothels, including Le Chabanais, Le Sphinx, One Two Two, La rue des Moulins, and Chez Marguerite, were reserved for German officers and collaborating Frenchmen. Piaf was invited to take part in a concert tour to Berlin, sponsored by the German officials, together with artists such as Loulou Gasté, Raymond Souplex, Viviane Romance and Albert Préjean. In 1942, she was able to afford a luxury flat in a house in the upmarket 16th arrondissement of Paris area. She lived above the L&#x27;Étoile de Kléber, a famous nightclub and bordello close to the Paris Gestapo headquarters.

Piaf was accused of collaborating with the German occupying forces and had to testify before a Épuration légale (post-war legal trial), as there were plans to ban her from appearing on radio transmissions. However, her secretary Andrée Bigard, a member of the French Resistance, spoke in her favour after the Liberation. According to Bigard, she performed several times at prisoner-of-war camps in Germany and was instrumental in helping a number of prisoners escape. At the beginning of the war, Piaf had met Michel Emer, a Jewish musician famous for the song &quot;L&#x27;Accordéoniste&quot;. Piaf paid for Emer to travel into France before German occupation, where he lived in safety until the liberation. Following the trial, Piaf was quickly back in the singing business and in December 1944, she performed for the Allied forces in Marseille, alongside singer/actor Yves Montand.

Earlier in 1944, Piaf performed in the Moulin Rouge cabaret venue in Paris, where she worked with Montand and began an affair with him.

=== 1945–1955 ===

Piaf wrote and performed her signature song, &quot;&quot; in 1945. This song was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.

In 1947, she wrote the lyrics to the song &quot;What Can I Do?&quot; for her lover Montand. Within a year, Montand became one of the most famous singers in France. She broke off their relationship when he had become almost as popular as she was.

During this time, she was in great demand and very successful in Paris as France&#x27;s most popular entertainer. After the war, she became known internationally, touring Europe, the United States, and South America. In Paris, she gave Argentinian guitarist-singer Atahualpa Yupanqui – a central figure in the Argentine folk music tradition – the opportunity to share the scene, making his debut in July 1950. Piaf also helped launch the career of Charles Aznavour in the early 1950s, taking him on tour with her in France and the United States and recording some of his songs. At first she met with little success with American audiences, who expected a gaudy spectacle and were disappointed by Piaf&#x27;s simple presentation. However, after a glowing review by influential New York critic Virgil Thomson in 1947, her popularity in the U.S. grew to the point where she eventually appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; eight times, and at Carnegie Hall twice (in 1956 and 1957).

=== 1955–1963 ===
Between January 1955 and October 1962, Piaf performed several series of concerts at the Paris Olympia music hall. Excerpts from five of these concerts (1955, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1962) were issued on vinyl record (and later on CD), and have never been out of print. In the 1961 concerts, promised by Piaf in an effort to save the venue from bankruptcy, she first sang &quot;Non, je ne regrette rien&quot;. In early 1963, Piaf recorded her last song before her death, titled &quot;L&#x27;Homme de Berlin&quot;.

==Personal life==
During a tour of America in 1947, Piaf met boxer Marcel Cerdan and fell in love. They had an affair, which made international headlines since Cerdan was the former middleweight world champion, and at the time was married with three children. In October 1949, Cerdan boarded a flight from Paris to New York to meet Piaf. While on approach to land at Santa Maria in the Azores for a scheduled stopover, the aircraft crashed into a mountain, killing Cerdan and everyone else on board. In May 1950, Piaf recorded the hit song &quot;Hymne à l&#x27;amour&quot; dedicating it to Cerdan.

Piaf was injured in a car accident that occurred in 1951. Both Piaf and singer Charles Aznavour (her then-assistant) were passengers in the vehicle, with Piaf suffering a broken arm and two broken ribs. Her doctor prescribed the drug morphine as a treatment, which became a dependency alongside her alcohol problems. Two more near-fatal car crashes exacerbated the situation. In 1952, her then-husband forced Piaf into a detox clinic on three separate occasions.

In 1952, Piaf married her first husband, singer Jacques Pills (real name René Ducos), with Marlene Dietrich performing the matron of honour duties. Piaf and Pills divorced in 1957. In 1962, she wed Théo Sarapo (Theophanis Lamboukas), a singer, actor, and former hairdresser who was born in France of Greek descent. Sarapo was 20 years younger than Piaf and the two remained married until Piaf&#x27;s death.

== Death ==
In early 1963, soon after recording &quot;L&#x27;Homme de Berlin&quot; with her husband Théo Sarapo, Piaf slipped into a coma due to liver cancer. She was taken to her villa in Plascassier on the French Riviera where she was nursed by Sarapo and her friend Simone Berteaut. Over the next few months she drifted in and out of consciousness, before dying at age 47 on 10 October 1963.

Her last words were &quot;Every damn thing you do in this life, you have to pay for.&quot; It is said that Sarapo drove her body from Plascassier to Paris secretly, so that fans would think she had died in her hometown.

Piaf&#x27;s body is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where her grave is among the most visited.

== Funeral and 2013 Requiem Mass ==
Shortly after her death, Piaf&#x27;s funeral procession drew tens of thousands of mourners onto the streets of Paris, and the ceremony at the cemetery was attended by more than 100,000 fans. According to Piaf&#x27;s colleague Charles Aznavour, Piaf&#x27;s funeral procession was the only time since the end of World War II that the traffic in Paris had come to a complete stop.

However, at the time, Piaf had been denied a Catholic Requiem Mass by Cardinal Maurice Feltin, since she had remarried after divorce in the Orthodox Church. Fifty years later, the French Catholic Church recanted and gave Piaf a Requiem Mass in the St. Jean-Baptiste Church in Belleville, Paris (the parish into which she was born) on 10 October 2013.

== Legacy ==
French media have continually published magazines, books, plays, television specials and films about the star, often on the anniversary of her death. In 1969, her longtime friend Simone &quot;Mômone&quot; Berteaut published a biography titled &quot;Piaf.&quot; This biography contained the false claim that Bertreaut was Piaf&#x27;s half-sister. In 1973, the Association of the Friends of Édith Piaf was formed, followed by the inauguration of the Place Édith Piaf in Belleville in 1981. Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina named a small planet, 3772 Piaf, in her honor.

A fan and author of two Piaf biographies operates the Musée Édith Piaf, a two-room museum in Paris. The museum is located in the fan&#x27;s apartment and has operated since 1977.

A concert titled &quot;Piaf: A Centennial Celebration&quot; was held at The Town Hall in New York City on 19 December 2015, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Piaf&#x27;s birth. The events was hosted by Robert Osborne and produced by Daniel Nardicio and Andy Brattain. Performers included Little Annie, Gay Marshall, Amber Martin, Marilyn Maye, Meow Meow, Elaine Paige, Molly Pope, Vivian Reed, Kim David Smith, and Aaron Weinstein.

At the 2024 Olympic Summer Games opening ceremony, Canadian singer Celine Dion performed &quot;L&#x27;Hymne à l&#x27;amour&quot;.

Her other television projects include the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero miniseries &quot;The Defenders&quot; (2017) and the drama miniseries &quot;The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart&quot; (2023).

== Early life and education ==
Susan Alexandra Weaver was born in New York City on October 8, 1949, the daughter of English actress Elizabeth Inglis (1913–2007) and American television executive Pat Weaver (1908–2002). Her father served as president of NBC from 1953 to 1955, during which time he created &quot;The Today Show&quot;. Pat&#x27;s brother, Doodles Weaver, was a comedian and contributor to &quot;Mad&quot;. She is of Dutch, English, German and Scottish descent through her father.

At the age of 14, Weaver began using the name &quot;Sigourney&quot; after she took it from a minor character in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. She briefly attended the Brearley School and Chapin School in New York before arriving at the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she developed an early interest in performing. One of her early roles was in a school adaptation of the poem &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, and on another occasion she played a Rudolph Valentino character in an adaptation of &quot;The Sheik&quot;. She was also involved in theatrical productions of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; during one summer in Southbury, Connecticut. Known for her height, she reportedly reached by the age of 11, which had a negative impact on her self-esteem; she recalled feeling like &quot;a giant spider&quot; and never having &quot;the confidence to ever think [she] could act&quot;.

In 1967, shortly before turning 18, Weaver visited Israel and volunteered on a kibbutz for several months. Upon returning to the United States, she attended Sarah Lawrence College. After her freshman year, she transferred to Stanford University as an English major. At Stanford, she was extensively involved in theater. She performed with a group in Palo Alto named &quot;The Company&quot;, doing Shakespeare plays and &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte in a covered wagon&quot; around the Bay Area, the nature of which she considered &quot;outrageous&quot;. She &quot;dressed like an elf and lived in a tree house&quot; and avoided Stanford&#x27;s drama department as she believed their productions were too &quot;stuffy&quot; and &quot;safe&quot;. She had planned to enter Stanford&#x27;s Ph.D. English program and eventually pursue a career as a writer or a journalist, but changed her mind after getting frustrated by the &quot;deadly dry&quot; honors courses. She eventually graduated in 1972 with a BA in English. She subsequently applied to the Yale School of Drama, performing Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan of the Stockyards&quot; at her audition, and was accepted.

Weaver admitted that she had a difficult time at Yale. She was not fond of the shows at Yale Repertory Theatre, and had little luck getting lead roles in school productions. Some of her acting teachers referred to her as &quot;talentless&quot; and advised her to stick to comedy. She later said she pulled through due to her time at the Yale Cabaret, and with the help of friends such as Christopher Durang, who kept casting her in his plays. She graduated from Yale with an MFA in 1974.

== Career ==
=== 1970s: Initial work and breakthrough ===
Weaver performed in the first production of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;The Frogs&quot; while at Yale in 1974, alongside Larry Blyden and fellow students Meryl Streep and Durang. She was briefly an understudy in a John Gielgud production of &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot; thereafter. She also acted in numerous original plays by Durang. In 1974 she made her Broadway debut in the William Somerset Maugham play &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; acting opposite Ingrid Bergman. Before her on-screen breakthrough, she had appeared only in commercials, a few television roles (including an appearance in the soap opera &quot;Somerset&quot;), and had a small part in the Woody Allen-directed romantic comedy-drama &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977). Her originally more substantial &quot;Annie Hall&quot; role was scaled back due to her commitment to the Durang play &quot;Titanic&quot;. 

Weaver appeared two years later as Warrant Officer / Lieutenant Ripley in Ridley Scott&#x27;s blockbuster film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), in a role initially designated to co-star British-born actress Veronica Cartwright until a late change in casting. Cartwright stated to World Entertainment News Network (WENN) that she was in England ready to start work on &quot;Alien&quot; when she discovered that she would be playing the navigator Lambert in the project, and Weaver had been given the lead role of Ellen Ripley. Reviews of the film were initially mixed, but it has since been ranked among the greatest science fiction horror films and is Weaver&#x27;s first film to be inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Film critic Gene Siskel called Weaver &quot;an actress who should become a major star,&quot; and Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that Weaver &quot;begins the action looking girlish and serious, but changes into the toughly self-reliant woman who defined her subsequent roles. Her career evolves before our very eyes.&quot; Among other accolades, she was nominated for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles at the 33rd British Academy Film Awards.

=== 1980s: Stardom and acclaim ===

Weaver appeared in an off-Broadway production of Durang&#x27;s comedy &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot; in 1981, which was directed by then-fledgling director Jerry Zaks. She next appeared opposite Mel Gibson as British Embassy officer Jill Bryant in the Peter Weir directed romantic drama &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982) which was released to critical acclaim. Roger Ebert opined, &quot;Weaver has a less interesting role but is always an interesting actress&quot;. In 1984 she returned to Broadway acting in the David Rabe play &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; acting opposite William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Cynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller, Ron Silver, and Judith Ivey. The production was directed by Mike Nichols with Weaver taking on the role of Darlene, a scatterbrained photojournalist who gets involved with two roommates. The role earned Weaver a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. That same year she took the female leading role Dana Barrett in the comedy films &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) and reprised her role in &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1988) acting alongside Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.

Weaver reprised the role of Ellen Ripley seven years later in the sequel to &quot;Alien&quot;, similarly titled &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986) directed by James Cameron. Critic Roger Ebert wrote &quot;Weaver, who is onscreen almost all the time, comes through with a very strong, sympathetic performance: She&#x27;s the thread that holds everything together.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; said that, at that point, she was the only actress who could &quot;open&quot; an action movie. For &quot;Aliens&quot;, she won the Saturn Award for Best Actress and earned her first nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

In 1988, Weaver starred as primatologist Dian Fossey in the biographical drama &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;. The same year, she appeared opposite Harrison Ford in a supporting role as main antagonist Katharine Parker in the comedy-drama &quot;Working Girl&quot;. Both these films earned Weaver Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture for her two roles that year. At the Golden Globes that year, Weaver was one of three actresses to win in Best Actress, alongside Jodie Foster and Shirley MacLaine, in a three-way tie. Weaver received simultaneous Academy Award nominations in 1988Best Actress for &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; and Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Working Girl&quot;. She was the first of four actresses (as of 2023) to have won two Golden Globes in the same year.

=== 1990s: Continued awards success ===
Weaver returned to the big screen with &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992) and Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot; (1992) in which she played the role of Queen Isabella. In the early 1990s, Weaver appeared in several films including &quot;Dave&quot; opposite Kevin Kline and Frank Langella. In 1994, she starred in Roman Polanski&#x27;s drama &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; as Paulina Escobar. She played the role of agoraphobic criminal psychologist Helen Hudson in the film &quot;Copycat&quot; (1995). Weaver also concentrated on smaller and supporting roles such as &quot;Jeffrey&quot; (1994) with Nathan Lane and Patrick Stewart.

In 1997, she appeared in Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; as Janey Carver, a bored but stylish housewife trapped in a failed marriage. Weaver earned her second Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture nomination for the role and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 1999, she co-starred as Gwen DeMarco in the science fiction comedy &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; and as Alice Goodwin, a mother and school nurse whose negligence results in the accidental drowning of a friend&#x27;s toddler in the drama &quot;A Map of the World&quot;, earning her a third nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for the latter. She also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that same year.

When talking about the character Weaver told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;She sort of has some superficial resemblance, obviously, to Hillary Clinton but really Elaine has made some decisions that distinguish her from Mrs. Clinton — who we all admire&quot;. Critic Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; praised its ensemble, specifically Weaver citing her as &quot;representing an inspired choice to portray Elaine, someone brimming with integrity, pain and grit all at once.&quot; For her performance she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award, Golden Globe Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actress in a Miniseries or Movie.

<text>Maria Callas (born Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos; December 2, 1923 – September 16, 1977) was an American-born Greek soprano and one of the most renowned and influential opera singers of the 20th century. Many critics praised her &quot;bel canto&quot; technique, wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations. Her repertoire ranged from classical &quot;opera seria&quot; to the &quot;bel canto&quot; operas of Donizetti, Bellini, and Rossini, and further to the works of Verdi and Puccini, and in her early career to the music dramas of Wagner. Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as &quot;La Divina&quot; (&quot;The Divine One&quot;).

Born in Manhattan and raised in Astoria, Queens, New York City, to Greek immigrant parents, she was raised by an overbearing mother who had wanted a son. Maria received her musical education in Greece at age 13 and later established her career in Italy. Forced to deal with the exigencies of 1940s wartime poverty and with near-sightedness that left her nearly blind on stage, she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career. She underwent a mid-career weight loss, which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career.

The press exulted in publicizing Callas&#x27;s temperamental behavior, the alleged Callas-Tebaldi rivalry, and her love affair with Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Although her dramatic life and personal tragedy have often overshadowed Callas the artist in the popular press, her artistic achievements were such that Leonard Bernstein called her &quot;the Bible of opera&quot;, and her influence so enduring that, in 2006, &quot;Opera News&quot; wrote of her: &quot;Nearly thirty years after her death, she&#x27;s still the definition of the diva as artist—and still one of classical music&#x27;s best-selling vocalists.&quot;

==Early life==
===Family life, childhood and move to Greece===

The name on Callas&#x27;s New York birth certificate is Sophie Cecilia Kalos, although she was christened Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos (). She was born at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital (now the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center) on December 2, 1923, to Greek parents, George Kalogeropoulos (c. 1881–1972) and Elmina Evangelia &quot;Litsa,&quot; née Demes, originally Dimitriadou (c. 1894–1982). Callas&#x27;s father had shortened the surname Kalogeropoulos, first to Kalos and subsequently to Callas to make it more manageable.

George and Litsa Callas were an ill-matched couple from the beginning. George was easy-going and unambitious, with no interest in the arts, and Litsa was vivacious and socially ambitious and had dreamed of a life in the arts, which her middle-class parents had stifled in her childhood and youth. Litsa&#x27;s father, Petros Dimitriadis (1852–1916), was in failing health when Litsa introduced George to her family. Petros, distrustful of George, had warned his daughter, &quot;You will never be happy with him. If you marry that man, I will never be able to help you.&quot; Litsa had ignored his warning but soon realized that her father was right. The situation was aggravated by George&#x27;s philandering and was improved neither by the birth of their daughter Yakinthi (later called &quot;Jackie&quot;), in 1917, nor the birth of their son Vassilis, in 1920. Vassilis&#x27;s death from meningitis in the summer of 1922 dealt another blow to the marriage.

In 1923, after realizing that Litsa was pregnant again, George moved his family to the United States, a decision that Yakinthi recalled was greeted with Litsa &quot;shouting hysterically&quot; followed by George &quot;slamming doors&quot;. The family left for New York in July 1923, moving first into an apartment in the heavily immigrant neighborhood of Astoria, Queens.

Litsa was convinced that her third child would be a boy, and her disappointment at the birth of another daughter was so great that she refused even to look at her new baby for four days. Maria was christened three years later, in 1926, at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. When Maria was four, George Callas opened his own pharmacy, settling the family in Manhattan on 192nd Street in Washington Heights, where Callas grew up. Around the age of three, Maria&#x27;s musical talent began to manifest itself, and after Litsa discovered that her younger daughter also had a voice, she began pressing &quot;Mary&quot; to sing. Callas later recalled, &quot;I was made to sing when I was only five, and I hated it.&quot; George was unhappy with his wife favoring their elder daughter, as well as the pressure put upon young Mary to sing and perform, and Litsa was increasingly embittered with George and his absences and infidelity and often violently reviled him in front of their children. The marriage continued to deteriorate, and in 1937 Litsa returned to Athens with her two daughters.

===Relationship with mother===
Callas&#x27;s relationship with her mother continued to erode during the years in Greece, and in the prime of her career it became a matter of great public interest, especially after a 1956 cover story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which focused on their relationship, and later by Litsa&#x27;s book, &quot;My Daughter Maria Callas&quot; (1960). In public, Callas recalls the strained relationship with Litsa on her unhappy childhood spent singing and working at her mother&#x27;s insistence, saying,
My sister was slim and beautiful and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted ... I&#x27;ll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.

In 1957 she told Chicago radio host Norman Ross Jr, &quot;There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.&quot;

Biographer says that Litsa&#x27;s hateful treatment of George in front of their young children led to resentment and dislike on Callas&#x27;s part. According to both Callas&#x27;s husband and her close friend Giulietta Simionato, Callas related to them that her mother, who did not work, pressed her to &quot;go out with various men&quot;, mainly Italian and German soldiers, to bring home money and food during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Simionato was convinced that Callas &quot;managed to remain untouched&quot; but never forgave her mother for what she perceived as a kind of prostitution forced on her. Litsa, beginning in New York and continuing in Athens, had adopted a questionable lifestyle that included not only pushing her daughters into degrading situations to support her financially but also entertaining Italian and German soldiers during the Axis occupation.

In an attempt to patch things up with her mother, Callas took Litsa along on her first visit to Mexico, in 1950, but this only reawakened the old frictions and resentments, and after leaving Mexico, they never met again. After a series of angry and accusatory letters from Litsa lambasting Callas&#x27;s father and husband, Callas ceased communication with her mother altogether.

A 1955 &quot;Time&quot; story covered Callas&#x27;s response to her mother&#x27;s request for $100, &quot;for my daily bread.&quot; Callas had replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t come to us with your troubles. I had to work for my money, and you are young enough to work, too. If you can&#x27;t make enough money to live on, you can jump out of the window or drown yourself.&quot; Callas justified her behavior ... &quot;They say my family is very short of money. Before God, I say why should they blame me? I feel no guilt and I feel no gratitude. I like to show kindness, but you mustn&#x27;t expect thanks, because you won&#x27;t get any. That&#x27;s the way life is. If some day I need help, I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything from anybody. When I&#x27;m old, nobody is going to worry about me.&quot;

==Education==
Callas received her musical education in Athens. Initially, her mother tried to enroll her at the prestigious Athens Conservatoire, without success. At the audition, her voice, still untrained, failed to impress, and the conservatoire&#x27;s director refused to accept her without her satisfying the theoretic prerequisites (solfege). In the summer of 1937, her mother visited Maria Trivella at the younger Greek National Conservatoire, asking her to take Mary, as she was then called, as a student for a modest fee. In 1957, Trivella recalled her impression of &quot;Mary, a very plump young girl, wearing big glasses for her myopia&quot;:
The tone of the voice was warm, lyrical, intense; it swirled and flared like a flame and filled the air with melodious reverberations like a carillon. It was by any standards an amazing phenomenon, or rather it was a great talent that needed control, technical training and strict discipline in order to shine with all its brilliance.

Trivella agreed to tutor Callas, completely waiving her tuition fees, but no sooner had Callas started her formal lessons and vocal exercises than Trivella began to feel that Callas was not a contralto, as she had been told, but a dramatic soprano. Subsequently, they began working on raising the tessitura of her voice and to lighten its timbre. Trivella recalled Callas as
A model student. Fanatical, uncompromising, dedicated to her studies heart and soul. Her progress was phenomenal. She studied five or six hours a day. ... Within six months, she was singing the most difficult arias in the international opera repertoire with the utmost musicality.
On April 11, 1938, in her public debut, Callas ended the recital of Trivella&#x27;s class at the Parnassos music hall with a duet from &quot;Tosca&quot;. Callas recalled that Trivella
had a French method, which was placing the voice in the nose, rather nasal ... and I had the problem of not having low chest tones, which is essential in &quot;bel canto&#x27; &#x27;... And that&#x27;s where I learned my chest tones.

However, when interviewed by Pierre Desgraupes on the French program &quot;L&#x27;invitée du dimanche&quot;, Callas attributed the development of her chest voice not to Trivella but to her next teacher, the Spanish coloratura soprano Elvira de Hidalgo.

Callas studied with Trivella for two years before her mother secured another audition at the Athens Conservatoire, with de Hidalgo. Callas auditioned with &quot;Ocean, Thou Mighty Monster&quot; from Weber&#x27;s &quot;Oberon&quot;. De Hidalgo recalled hearing &quot;tempestuous, extravagant cascades of sounds, as yet uncontrolled but full of drama and emotion&quot;. She agreed to take her as a pupil immediately, but Callas&#x27;s mother asked de Hidalgo to wait for a year, as Callas would be graduating from the National Conservatoire and could begin working. On April 2, 1939, Callas undertook the part of Santuzza in a student production of Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; by the Greek National Opera at the Olympia Theatre, and that autumn she enrolled at the Athens Conservatoire in Elvira de Hidalgo&#x27;s class.

In 1968 Callas told Lord Harewood,
De Hildalgo had the real great training, maybe even the last real training of the &quot;bel canto&quot;. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this &quot;bel canto&quot;, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it is a sort of a strait-jacket that you&#x27;re supposed to put on, whether you like it or not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real &quot;bel canto&quot; way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the &quot;bel canto&quot; embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.

De Hidalgo later recalled Callas as &quot;a phenomenon ... She would listen to all my students, sopranos, mezzos, tenors ... She could do it all.&quot; Callas said that she would go to &quot;the conservatoire at 10 in the morning and leave with the last pupil ... devouring music&quot; for 10 hours a day. When asked by her teacher why she did this, her answer was that even &quot;with the least talented pupil, he can teach you something that you, the most talented, might not be able to do.&quot;

==Early operatic career in Greece==
After several appearances as a student, Callas began appearing in secondary roles at the Greek National Opera. De Hidalgo was instrumental in securing roles for her, allowing Callas to earn a small salary, which helped her and her family get through the difficult war years.

Callas made her professional debut in February 1941, in the small role of Beatrice in Franz von Suppé&#x27;s &quot;Boccaccio&quot;. Soprano Galatea Amaxopoulou, who sang in the chorus, later recalled, &quot;Even in rehearsal, Maria&#x27;s fantastic performing ability had been obvious, and from then on, the others started trying ways of preventing her from appearing.&quot; Fellow singer Maria Alkeou similarly recalled that the established sopranos Nafsika Galanou and Anna (Zozó) Remmoundou &quot;used to stand in the wings while [Callas] was singing and make remarks about her, muttering, laughing, and point their fingers at her&quot;.

Despite these hostilities, Callas managed to continue and made her debut in a leading role in August 1942 as Tosca, going on to sing the role of Marta in Eugen d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s &quot;Tiefland&quot; at the Olympia Theatre. Callas&#x27;s performance as Marta received glowing reviews. Critic Spanoudi declared Callas &quot;an extremely dynamic artist possessing the rarest dramatic and musical gifts&quot;, and Evangelos Magkliveras evaluated Callas&#x27;s performance for the weekly &quot;To Radiophonon&quot;:
The singer who took the part of Marta, that new star in the Greek firmament, with a matchless depth of feeling, gave a theatrical interpretation well up to the standard of a tragic actress. About her exceptional voice with its astonishing natural fluency, I do not wish to add anything to the words of Alexandra Lalaouni: &#x27;Kalogeropoulou is one of those God-given talents that one can only marvel at.&#x27;

Following these performances, even Callas&#x27;s detractors began to refer to her as &quot;The God-Given&quot;. Some time later, watching Callas rehearse Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, rival soprano Anna Remoundou asked a colleague &quot;Could it be that there is something divine and we haven&#x27;t realized it?&quot; Following &quot;Tiefland&quot;, Callas sang the role of Santuzza in &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; again and followed it with &quot;&quot; (Manolis Kalomiris) at the ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus at the foot of the Acropolis.

During August and September 1944 Callas performed the role of Leonore in a Greek-language production of &quot;Fidelio&quot;, again at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. German critic Friedrich Herzog, who attended the performances, declared Leonore Callas&#x27;s &quot;greatest triumph&quot;:
When Maria Kaloyeropoulou&#x27;s Leonore let her soprano soar out radiantly in the untrammelled jubilation of the duet, she rose to the most sublime heights ... Here she gave bud, blossom and fruit to that harmony of sound that also ennobled the art of the prima donna.

After the liberation of Greece, de Hidalgo advised Callas to establish herself in Italy. Callas proceeded to give a series of concerts around Greece, and then, against her teacher&#x27;s advice, she returned to America to see her father and to further pursue her career. When she left Greece on September 14, 1945, two months short of her 22nd birthday, Callas had given 56 performances in seven operas and had appeared in around 20 recitals. Callas considered her Greek career as the foundation of her musical and dramatic upbringing, saying &quot;When I got to the big career, there were no surprises for me.&quot;

==Main operatic career==
After returning to the United States and reuniting with her father in September 1945, Callas made the round of auditions. In December of that year, she auditioned for Edward Johnson, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, and was favorably received: &quot;Exceptional voice—ought to be heard very soon on stage&quot;.

Callas said that the Metropolitan Opera offered her &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Fidelio&quot;, to be performed in Philadelphia and sung in English, both of which she declined, saying that she felt too fat for &quot;Butterfly&quot; and did not like the idea of opera in English. Although this offer is not documented in the Met&#x27;s records, in a 1958 interview with the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Johnson confirmed that a contract was offered: &quot;... but she didn&#x27;t like it—because of the contract, not because of the roles. She was right in turning it down—it was frankly a beginner&#x27;s contract.&quot;

===Italy, Meneghini, and Serafin===
In 1946, Callas was engaged to re-open the opera house in Chicago as &quot;Turandot&quot;, but the company folded before opening. Basso Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, who also was to star in this opera, was aware that Tullio Serafin was looking for a dramatic soprano to cast as &quot;La Gioconda&quot; at the Arena di Verona. He later recalled the young Callas as being &quot;amazing—so strong physically and spiritually; so certain of her future. I knew in a big outdoor theatre like Verona&#x27;s, this girl, with her courage and huge voice, would make a tremendous impact.&quot; Subsequently he recommended Callas to retired tenor and impresario Giovanni Zenatello. During her audition, Zenatello became so excited that he jumped up and joined Callas in the act 4 duet.
It was in this role that Callas made her Italian debut. Upon her arrival in Verona, Callas met Giovanni Battista Meneghini, an older, wealthy industrialist, who began courting her. They married in 1949, and he assumed control of her career until 1959, when the marriage dissolved. It was Meneghini&#x27;s love and support that gave Callas the time needed to establish herself in Italy, and throughout the prime of her career, she went by the name of Maria Meneghini Callas.

After &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, Callas had no offers, and when Serafin, looking for someone to sing Isolde, called on her, she told him that she already knew the score, even though she had looked at only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory. She sight-read the opera&#x27;s second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she admitted to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas&#x27;s mentor and supporter.

Lord Harewood stated &quot;Very few Italian conductors have had a more distinguished career than Tullio Serafin, and perhaps none, apart from Toscanini, more influence&quot;. In 1968, Callas recalled that working with Serafin was the &quot;really lucky&quot; opportunity of her career because &quot;he taught me that there must be an expression; that there must be a justification. He taught me the depth of music, the justification of music. That&#x27;s where I really really drank all I could from this man&quot;.

===&quot;I puritani&quot; and path to &quot;bel canto&quot;===
The great turning point in Callas&#x27;s career occurred in Venice in 1949. She was engaged to sing the role of Brünnhilde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in &quot;I puritani&quot; in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas that she would be singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Brünnhildes to sing, he told her &quot;I guarantee that you can&quot;. Michael Scott&#x27;s words, &quot;the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner&#x27;s Brünnhilde and Bellini&#x27;s Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like &quot;folie de grandeur&quot;&quot;.

Before the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, &quot;We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct &quot;I puritani&quot; with a dramatic soprano ... When can we expect a new edition of &quot;La traviata&quot; with [male baritone] Gino Bechi&#x27;s Violetta?&quot; After the performance, one critic wrote, &quot;Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished ... the flexibility of her limpid, beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras.&quot; Franco Zeffirelli recalled, &quot;What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the size of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, who is one of the great coloratura sopranos of our time.&quot;

Scott asserts that &quot;Of all the many roles Callas undertook, it is doubtful if any had a more far-reaching effect.&quot; This initial foray into the bel canto repertoire changed the course of Callas&#x27;s career and set her on a path leading to &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Armida&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Il pirata&quot;, &quot;Il turco in Italia&quot;, &quot;Medea&quot;, and &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, and reawakened interest in the long-neglected operas of Cherubini, Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini.

In the words of soprano Montserrat Caballé:
She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was sleeping not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has given us the chance, those who follow her, to do things that were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.

As with &quot;I puritani&quot;, Callas learned and performed Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot;, Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Armida&quot; on a few days&#x27; notice. Throughout her career, Callas displayed her vocal versatility in recitals that juxtaposed dramatic soprano arias alongside coloratura pieces, including in a 1952 RAI recital in which she opened with &quot;Lady Macbeth&#x27;s&quot; letter scene, followed by the &quot;Mad Scene&quot; from &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, then Abigaille&#x27;s treacherous recitative and aria from &quot;Nabucco&quot;, finishing with the &quot;Bell Song&quot; from &quot;Lakmé&quot; capped by a ringing high E &quot;in alt&quot; (E6).

===Important debuts===
Although by 1951, Callas had sung at all the major theatres in Italy, she had not yet made her official debut at Italy&#x27;s most prestigious opera house, Teatro alla Scala in Milan. According to composer Gian Carlo Menotti, Callas had substituted for Renata Tebaldi in the role of &quot;Aida&quot; in 1950, and La Scala&#x27;s general manager, Antonio Ghiringhelli, had taken an immediate dislike to Callas.

Menotti recalls that Ghiringhelli had promised him any singer he wanted for the premiere of &quot;The Consul&quot;, but when he suggested Callas, Ghiringhelli said that he would never have Callas at La Scala except as a guest artist. However, as Callas&#x27;s fame grew, and especially after her great success in &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot; in Florence, Ghiringhelli had to relent: Callas made her official debut at La Scala in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot; on opening night in December 1951, and this theatre became her artistic home throughout the 1950s. La Scala mounted many new productions specially for Callas by directors including Herbert von Karajan, Margherita Wallmann, Franco Zeffirelli and, most importantly, Luchino Visconti. Visconti stated later that he began directing opera only because of Callas, and he directed her in lavish new productions of &quot;La vestale&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;. Callas was instrumental in arranging Franco Corelli&#x27;s debut at La Scala in 1954, where he sang Licinio in Spontini&#x27;s &quot;La vestale&quot; opposite Callas&#x27;s Julia. The two had sung together for the first time the year previously in Rome in a production of &quot;Norma&quot;. Anthony Tommasini wrote that Corelli had &quot;earned great respect from the fearsomely demanding Callas, who, in Mr Corelli, finally had someone with whom she could act.&quot; The two collaborated several more times at La Scala, singing opposite each other in productions of &quot;Fedora&quot; (1956), &quot;Il pirata&quot; (1958) and &quot;Poliuto&quot; (1960). Their partnership continued throughout the rest of Callas&#x27;s career.
The night of the day she married Meneghini in Verona, she sailed for Argentina to sing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. Callas made her South American debut in Buenos Aires on May 20, 1949, during the European summer opera recess. &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Turandot&quot; and &quot;Norma&quot; roles were directed by Serafin, supported by Mario Del Monaco, Fedora Barbieri and Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. These were her only appearances on this world-renowned stage. Her debut in the United States was five years later in Chicago in 1954, and &quot;with the Callas &quot;Norma&quot;, Lyric Opera of Chicago was born.&quot;

Her Metropolitan Opera debut, opening the Met&#x27;s seventy-second season on October 29, 1956, was again with &quot;Norma&quot;, but was preceded by an unflattering cover story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which rehashed all of the Callas clichés, including her temper, her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi, and especially her difficult relationship with her mother. As she had done with Lyric Opera of Chicago, on November 21, 1957, Callas gave a concert to inaugurate what then was billed as the Dallas Civic Opera, and helped establish that company with her friends from Chicago, Lawrence Kelly and Nicola Rescigno. She further consolidated this company&#x27;s standing when, in 1958, she gave &quot;a towering performance as Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, and that same year, in her only American performances of &quot;Medea&quot;, gave an interpretation of the title role worthy of Euripides.&quot;

In 1958, a feud with general manager Rudolf Bing led to Callas&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera contract being cancelled. Impresario Allen Oxenburg realised that this situation provided him with an opportunity for his own company, the American Opera Society, and he accordingly approached her with a contract to perform Imogene in &quot;Il pirata&quot;. She accepted and sang the role in a January 1959 performance that according to opera critic Allan Kozinn &quot;quickly became legendary in operatic circles&quot;. Bing and Callas later reconciled their differences, and she returned to the Met in 1965 to sing the title role in two performances as Tosca opposite Franco Corelli as Cavaradossi for one performance (March 19, 1965) and Richard Tucker (March 25, 1965) with Tito Gobbi as Scarpia for her final performances at the Met.

In 1952, she made her London debut at the Royal Opera House in &quot;Norma&quot; with veteran mezzo-soprano Ebe Stignani as Adalgisa, a performance which survives on record and also features the young Joan Sutherland in the small role of Clotilde. Callas and the London public had what she called &quot;a love affair&quot;, and she returned to the Royal Opera House in 1953, 1957, 1958, 1959, and 1964 to 1965. It was at the Royal Opera House where, on July 5, 1965, Callas ended her stage career in the role of &quot;Tosca&quot;, in a production designed and mounted for her by Franco Zeffirelli and featuring her friend and colleague Tito Gobbi.

==Weight loss==

In the early years of her career, Callas was a heavy woman; in her own words, &quot;Heavy—one can say—yes I was; but I&#x27;m also a tall woman, 5&#x27; &quot; (), and I used to weigh no more than .&quot; Tito Gobbi relates that during a lunch break while recording &quot;Lucia&quot; in Florence, Serafin commented to Callas that she was eating too much and allowing her weight to become a problem. When she protested that she was not so heavy, Gobbi suggested she should &quot;put the matter to test&quot; by stepping on the weighing machine outside the restaurant. The result was &quot;somewhat dismaying, and she became rather silent.&quot; In 1968, Callas told Edward Downes that during her initial performances in Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot; in May 1953, she realized that she needed a leaner face and figure to do dramatic justice to this as well as the other roles she was undertaking. She added,

I was getting so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn&#x27;t really well, as in health; I couldn&#x27;t move freely. And then I was tired of playing a game, for instance playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn&#x27;t like it. So I felt now if I&#x27;m going to do things right—I&#x27;ve studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don&#x27;t I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I&#x27;m presentable.

During 1953 and early 1954, she lost almost , turning herself into what Rescigno called &quot;possibly the most beautiful lady on the stage.&quot; Various rumors spread regarding her weight loss method; one had her swallowing a tapeworm, and Rome&#x27;s Panatella Mills pasta company claimed she lost weight by eating their &quot;physiologic pasta,&quot; prompting Callas to file a lawsuit. Callas stated that she lost the weight by eating a sensible low-calorie diet of mainly salads and chicken. Callas never regained the weight she lost and kept her slim figure until her death.

Some believe that the loss of body mass made it more difficult for her to support her voice, triggering the vocal strain that became apparent later in the decade, and others believed the weight loss effected a newfound softness and femininity in her voice, as well as a greater confidence as a person and performer. Tito Gobbi said,

Now she was not only supremely gifted both musically and dramatically—she was a beauty too. And her awareness of this invested with fresh magic every role she undertook. What it eventually did to her vocal and nervous stamina I am not prepared to say. I only assert that she blossomed into an artist unique in her generation and outstanding in the whole range of vocal history.

==Voice==
===The Callas sound===

Callas&#x27;s voice elicited widely diverging reactions. Walter Legge stated that Callas possessed that most essential ingredient for a great singer: an instantly recognizable voice.

During &quot;The Callas Debate&quot;, Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated, &quot;The timbre of Callas&#x27; voice, considered purely as sound, was essentially ugly: it was a thick sound, which gave the impression of dryness, of aridity. It lacked those elements which, in a singer&#x27;s jargon, are described as velvet and varnish ... yet I really believe that part of her appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish, velvet and richness, this voice could acquire such distinctive colours and timbres as to be unforgettable.&quot; However, in his review of Callas&#x27;s 1951 live recording of &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot;, Ira Siff writes, &quot;Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed, even early on, a flawed voice, unattractive by conventional standards—an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich, spinning sound, ravishing by any standard, capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble, chest tones unforced, and the middle register displays none of the &#x27;bottled&#x27; quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured.&quot;

Nicola Rossi-Lemeni relates that Callas&#x27;s mentor Serafin used to refer to her as &quot;Una grande vociaccia&quot;; he continues, &quot;&quot;Vociaccia&quot; is a little bit pejorative—it means an ugly voice—but &quot;grande&quot; means a big voice, a great voice. A great ugly voice, in a way.&quot; Callas did not like the sound of her own voice; in one of her last interviews, answering whether or not she was able to listen to her own voice, she replies,
Yes, but I don&#x27;t like it. I have to do it, but I don&#x27;t like it at all because I don&#x27;t like the kind of voice I have. I really hate listening to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording &quot;San Giovanni Battista&quot; by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing ... Also now even though I don&#x27;t like my voice, I&#x27;ve become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, &quot;Oh, that was really well sung,&quot; or &quot;It was nearly perfect.&quot;

Carlo Maria Giulini has described the appeal of Callas&#x27;s voice:
It is very difficult to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.

===Vocal category===
Callas&#x27;s voice has been difficult to place in the modern vocal classification or Fach system, especially as in her prime her repertoire contained the heaviest dramatic soprano roles as well as roles usually undertaken by the highest, lightest and most agile coloratura sopranos. Regarding this versatility, Serafin said, &quot;This woman can sing anything written for the female voice&quot;. Michael Scott argues that Callas&#x27;s voice was a natural high soprano, and going by evidence of Callas&#x27;s early recordings Rosa Ponselle likewise felt that &quot;At that stage of its development, her voice was a pure but sizable dramatic coloratura—that is to say, a sizable coloratura voice with dramatic capabilities, not the other way around.&quot; On the other hand, music critic John Ardoin has argued that Callas was the reincarnation of the 19th-century &quot;soprano sfogato&quot; or &quot;unlimited soprano&quot;, a throwback to Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta, for whom many of the famous bel canto operas were written. He avers that like Pasta and Malibran, Callas was a natural mezzo-soprano whose range was extended through training and willpower, resulting in a voice which &quot;lacked the homogeneous color and evenness of scale once so prized in singing. There were unruly sections of their voices never fully under control. Many who heard Pasta, for example, remarked that her uppermost notes seemed produced by ventriloquism, a charge which would later be made against Callas&quot;. Ardoin points to the writings of Henry Chorley about Pasta which bear an uncanny resemblance to descriptions of Callas:
There was a portion of the scale which differed from the rest in quality and remained to the last &#x27;under a veil.&#x27; ... out of these uncouth materials she had to compose her instrument and then to give it flexibility. Her studies to acquire execution must have been tremendous; but the volubility and brilliancy, when acquired, gained a character of their own ... There were a breadth, an expressiveness in her roulades, an evenness and solidity in her shake, which imparted to every passage a significance totally beyond the reach of lighter and more spontaneous singers ... The best of her audience were held in thrall, without being able to analyze what made up the spell, what produced the effect—as soon as she opened her lips.

Callas appears to have been in agreement not only with Ardoin&#x27;s assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice: &quot;The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses&quot;, and in 1968 she added, &quot;They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo&quot;. Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood,
It&#x27;s study; it&#x27;s Nature. I&#x27;m doing nothing special, you know. Even &quot;Lucia&quot;, &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, &quot;Puritani&quot;, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang &quot;Norma&quot;, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and &quot;Sonnambula&quot;, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century ... So I&#x27;m really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn&#x27;t ask a pianist not to be able to play everything; he has to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods ... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.

===Vocal size and range===

Regarding the sheer size of Callas&#x27;s instrument, Rodolfo Celletti says, &quot;Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it frequently contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium.&quot; Celletti wrote that Callas had &quot;a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice&quot; (&quot;una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro&quot;). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for &quot;Musical Courier&quot; wrote that &quot;she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience.&quot; In a 1982 &quot;Opera News&quot; interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, &quot;But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad&#x27;s did ... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, at the bottom of the range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top.&quot; In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas&#x27;s pre-1954 voice was a &quot;dramatic soprano with an exceptional top&quot;, after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in &quot;Lucia&quot;, a &quot;huge soprano leggiero&quot;.

In performance, Callas&#x27;s vocal range was just short of three octaves, from F-sharp (F3) below middle C (C4) heard in &quot;Arrigo! Ah parli a un core&quot; from &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot; to E-natural (E6) above high C (C6), heard in the aria &quot;Mercè, dilette amiche&quot; in the final act of the same opera, as well as in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Armida&quot; and &quot;Lakmé&quot;″s Bell Song. Whether or not Callas ever sang a high F-natural in performance has been open to debate. After her June 11, 1951, concert in Florence, Rock Ferris of &quot;Musical Courier&quot; said, &quot;Her high E&#x27;s and F&#x27;s are taken full voice.&quot; Although no definite recording of Callas singing high Fs has surfaced, the presumed E-natural at the end of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Armida&quot;—a poor-quality bootleg recording of uncertain pitch—has been referred to as a high F by Italian musicologists and critics Eugenio Gara and Rodolfo Celletti. Callas expert Dr. Robert Seletsky, however, stated that since the finale of &quot;Armida&quot; is in the key of E, the final note could not have been an F, as it would have been dissonant. Author Eve Ruggieri has referred to the penultimate note in &quot;Mercè, dilette amiche&quot; from the 1951 Florence performances of &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot; as a high F; however, this claim is refuted by John Ardoin&#x27;s review of the live recording of the performance as well as by the review of the recording in &quot;Opera News&quot;, both of which refer to the note as a high E-natural.

In a 1969 French television interview with Pierre Desgraupes on the program &quot;L&#x27;invitée du dimanche&quot;, speaks of Callas&#x27;s voice going to high F (he also talked about her lower register extending to C3), but within the same program, Callas&#x27;s teacher, Elvira de Hidalgo, speaks of the voice soaring to a high E-natural but does not mention a high F. Callas remained silent on the subject, neither confirming nor denying either claim.

===Vocal registers===
Callas&#x27;s voice was noted for its three distinct registers: Her low or chest register was extremely dark and powerful, and she used this part of her voice for dramatic effect, often going into this register much higher on the scale than most sopranos. Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound—&quot;part oboe, part clarinet&quot;, as Claudia Cassidy described it—and was noted for its veiled or &quot;bottled&quot; sound, as if she were singing into a jug. Walter Legge, husband of diva Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, attributed this sound to the &quot;extraordinary formation of her upper palate, shaped like a Gothic arch, not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth&quot;.

The upper register was ample and bright, with an impressive extension above high C, which—in contrast to the light flute-like sound of the typical coloratura, &quot;she would attack these notes with more vehemence and power—quite differently therefore, from the very delicate, cautious, &#x27;white&#x27; approach of the light sopranos.&quot; Legge adds, &quot;Even in the most difficult fioriture there were no musical or technical difficulties in this part of the voice which she could not execute with astonishing, unostentatious ease. Her chromatic runs, particularly downwards, were beautifully smooth and staccatos almost unfailingly accurate, even in the trickiest intervals. There is hardly a bar in the whole range of nineteenth-century music for high soprano that seriously tested her powers.&quot; And as she demonstrated in the finale of &quot;La sonnambula&quot; on the commercial EMI set and the live recording from Cologne, she was able to execute a diminuendo on the stratospheric high E-flat, which Scott describes as &quot;a feat unrivaled in the history of the gramophone.&quot;

Regarding Callas&#x27;s soft singing, Celletti says, &quot;In these soft passages, Callas seemed to use another voice altogether, because it acquired a great sweetness. Whether in her florid singing or in her &quot;canto spianato&quot;, that is, in long held notes without ornamentation, her &quot;mezza voce&quot; could achieve such moving sweetness that the sound seemed to come from on high ... I don&#x27;t know, it seemed to come from the skylight of La Scala.&quot;

This combination of size, weight, range and agility was a source of amazement to Callas&#x27;s own contemporaries. One of the choristers present at her La Scala debut in &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot; recalled, &quot;My God! She came on stage sounding like our deepest contralto, Cloe Elmo. And before the evening was over, she took a high E-flat. And it was twice as strong as Toti Dal Monte&#x27;s!&quot; In the same vein, mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato said: &quot;The first time we sang together was in Mexico in 1950, where she sang the top E-flat in the second-act finale of &quot;Aida&quot;. I can still remember the effect of that note in the opera house—it was like a star!&quot; For Italian soprano Renata Tebaldi, &quot;the most fantastic thing was the possibility for her to sing the soprano coloratura with this big voice! This was something really special. Fantastic absolutely!&quot;

Callas&#x27;s vocal registers, however, were not seamlessly joined; Walter Legge writes, &quot;Unfortunately, it was only in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill.&quot; Rodolfo Celletti states,
In certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano&#x27;s voice—for instance where the lower and middle registers merge, between G and A. I would go so far as to say that here her voice had such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist ... or else the voice could sound as though it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot ... between the middle and upper registers. Here, too, around the treble F and G, there was often something in the sound itself which was not quite right, as though the voice were not functioning properly.

As to whether these troublesome spots were due to the nature of the voice or to technical deficiencies, Celletti says: &quot;Even if, when passing from one register to another, Callas produced an unpleasant sound, the technique she used for these transitions was perfect.&quot; Musicologist and critic adds, &quot;Callas&#x27; &#x27;faults&#x27; were in the voice and not in the singer; they are so to speak, faults of departure but not of arrival. This is precisely Celletti&#x27;s distinction between the natural quality of the voice and the technique.&quot; In 2005, Ewa Podleś said of Callas, &quot;Maybe she had three voices, maybe she had three ranges, I don&#x27;t know—I am a professional singer. Nothing disturbed me, nothing! I bought everything that she offered me. Why? Because all of her voices, her registers, she used how they should be used—just to tell us something!&quot;

Eugenio Gara states, &quot;Much has been said about her voice, and no doubt the discussion will continue. Certainly no one could in honesty deny the harsh or &quot;squashed&quot; sounds, nor the wobble on the very high notes. These and others were precisely the accusations made at the time against Pasta and Malibran, two geniuses of song (as they were then called), sublime, yet imperfect. Both were brought to trial in their day. ... Yet few singers have made history in the annals of opera as these two did.&quot;

==Artistry==
Callas&#x27;s own thoughts regarding music and singing can be found .

===The musician===

Adored by many opera enthusiasts, Callas was a controversial artist. Although Callas was the great singer often dismissed simply as an actress, Callas considered herself foremost a musician, that is, the first instrument of the orchestra.&quot; Grace Bumbry has stated, &quot;If I followed the musical score when [Callas] was singing, I would see every tempo marking, every dynamic marking, everything being adhered to, and at the same time, it was not antiseptic; it was something that was very beautiful and moving.&quot; Victor de Sabata confided to Walter Legge , &quot;If the public could understand, as we do, how deeply and utterly musical Callas is, they would be stunned&quot;, and Serafin assessed Callas&#x27;s musicality as &quot;extraordinary, almost frightening.&quot; Callas possessed an innate architectural sense of line-proportion and an uncanny feel for timing and for what one of Callas’s colleagues described as &quot;a sense of the rhythm within the rhythm&quot;.

Regarding Callas&#x27;s technical prowess, Celletti says, &quot;We must not forget that she could tackle the whole gamut of ornamentation: staccato, trills, half-trills, gruppetti, scales, etc.&quot; D&#x27;Amico adds, &quot;The essential virtue of Callas&#x27; technique consists of supreme mastery of an extraordinarily rich range of tone colour (that is, the fusion of dynamic range and timbre). And such mastery means total freedom of choice in its use: not being a slave to one&#x27;s abilities, but rather, being able to use them at will as a means to an end.&quot; While reviewing the many recorded versions of &quot;perhaps Verdi&#x27;s ultimate challenge&quot;, the aria &quot;D&#x27;amor sull&#x27;ali rosee&quot; from &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, Richard Dyer writes,
Callas articulates all of the trills, and she binds them into the line more expressively than anyone else; they are not an ornament but a form of intensification. Part of the wonder in this performance is the chiaroscuro through her tone—the other side of not singing full-out all the way through. One of the vocal devices that create that chiaroscuro is a varying rate of vibrato; another is her portamento, the way she connects the voice from note to note, phrase to phrase, lifting and gliding. This is never a sloppy swoop, because its intention is as musically precise as it is in great string playing. In this aria, Callas uses more portamento, and in greater variety, than any other singer ... Callas is not creating &quot;effects&quot;, as even her greatest rivals do. She sees the aria as a whole, &quot;as if in an aerial view&quot;, as Sviatoslav Richter&#x27;s teacher observed of his most famous pupil; simultaneously, she is on earth, standing in the courtyard of the palace of Aliaferia, floating her voice to the tower where her lover lies imprisoned.

In addition to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language and the use of language in music. In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes, &quot;If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text.&quot; Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states, &quot;What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something—it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art.&quot; Walter Legge states that,
Most admirable of all her qualities, however, were her taste, elegance and deeply musical use of ornamentation in all its forms and complications, the weighting and length of every appoggiatura, the smooth incorporation of the turn in melodic lines, the accuracy and pacing of her trills, the seemingly inevitable timing of her portamentos, varying their curve with enchanting grace and meaning. There were innumerable exquisite felicities—minuscule portamentos from one note to its nearest neighbor, or over widespread intervals—and changes of color that were pure magic. In these aspects of bel canto she was supreme mistress of that art.

===The actress===

Regarding Callas&#x27;s acting ability, vocal coach and music critic Ira Siff remarked, &quot;When I saw the final two &quot;Tosca&quot;s she did in the old [Met], I felt like I was watching the actual story on which the opera had later been based.&quot; Callas was not, however, a realistic or verismo style actress: her physical acting was merely &quot;subsidiary to the heavy &quot;Kunst&quot; of developing the psychology of the roles under the supervision of the music, of singing the acting ... Suffering, delight, humility, hubris, despair, rhapsody—all this was musically appointed, through her use of the voice flying the text upon the notes.&quot; Seconding this opinion, verismo specialist soprano Augusta Oltrabella said, &quot;Despite what everyone says, [Callas] was an actress in the expression of the music, and not vice versa.&quot;

Matthew Gurewitsch adds,
In fact the essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a performer whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas was not one of them. She found all she needed in the notes.

Ewa Podleś likewise stated that &quot;It&#x27;s enough to hear her, I&#x27;m positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! I can imagine everything, I can see everything in front of my eye.&quot; Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, &quot;For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms ... She was wasted in verismo roles, even &quot;Tosca&quot;, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles.&quot; Scott adds, &quot;Early nineteenth-century opera ... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance.&quot;

In regard to Callas&#x27;s physical acting style, Nicola Rescigno states, &quot;Maria had a way of even transforming her body for the exigencies of a role, which is a great triumph. In &quot;La traviata&quot;, everything would slope down; everything indicated sickness, fatigue, softness. Her arms would move as if they had no bones, like the great ballerinas. In &quot;Medea&quot;, everything was angular. She&#x27;d never make a soft gesture; even the walk she used was like a tiger&#x27;s walk.&quot; Sandro Sequi recalls, &quot;She was never in a hurry. Everything was very paced, proportioned, classical, precise ... She was extremely powerful but extremely stylized. Her gestures were not many ... I don&#x27;t think she did more than 20 gestures in a performance. But she was capable of standing 10 minutes without moving a hand or finger, compelling everyone to look at her.&quot; Edward Downes recalled Callas watching and observing her colleagues with such intensity and concentration as to make it seem that the drama was all unfolding in her head. Sir Rudolf Bing similarly recalled that in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in Chicago, &quot;it was Callas&#x27; quiet listening, rather than Björling&#x27;s singing that made the dramatic impact ... He didn&#x27;t know what he was singing, but she knew.&quot;

Callas stated that, in opera, acting must be based on the music, quoting Serafin&#x27;s advice to her:
When one wants to find a gesture, when you want to find how to act onstage, all you have to do is listen to the music. The composer has already seen to that. If you take the trouble to really listen with your Soul and with your Ears—and I say &#x27;Soul&#x27; and &#x27;Ears&#x27; because the Mind must work, but not too much also—you will find every gesture there.

===The artist===

Callas&#x27;s most distinguishing quality was her ability to breathe life into the characters she portrayed, or in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch, &quot;Most mysterious among her many gifts, Callas had the genius to translate the minute particulars of a life into tone of voice.&quot; Italian critic Eugenio Gara adds:

Her secret is in her ability to transfer to the musical plane the suffering of the character she plays, the nostalgic longing for lost happiness, the anxious fluctuation between hope and despair, between pride and supplication, between irony and generosity, which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would like to say, that psychological sonority, which is the primary attraction of opera.

Ethan Mordden writes, &quot;It was a flawed voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity, and within her system, the flaws feed the feeling, the sour plangency and the strident defiance becoming aspects of the canto. They were literally defects of her voice; she bent them into advantages of her singing.&quot; Giulini believes, &quot;If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, it is impossible to imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas.&quot; He recalls that during Callas&#x27;s performances of &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself.&quot; Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments:Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can&#x27;t really distinguish it—in a part, it was very hard to enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of her hand was more than another artist could do in a whole act.

To Antonino Votto, Callas was:The last great artist. When you think this woman was nearly blind, and often sang standing a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect ... She was not just a singer, but a complete artist. It&#x27;s foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.

==Alleged Callas–Tebaldi rivalry==

During the early 1950s, an alleged rivalry arose between Callas and Renata Tebaldi, an Italian lyrico spinto soprano. The contrast between Callas&#x27;s often unconventional vocal qualities and Tebaldi&#x27;s classically beautiful sound resurrected a debate, namely, beauty of sound versus the expressive use of sound.

In 1951, Tebaldi and Maria Callas were jointly booked for a vocal recital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although the singers agreed that neither would perform encores, Tebaldi took two, and Callas was reportedly incensed. This incident began the rivalry, which reached a fever pitch in the mid-1950s, at times even engulfing the two women themselves, who were said by their more fanatical followers to have engaged in verbal barbs in each other&#x27;s direction.

Tebaldi was quoted as saying, &quot;I have one thing that Callas doesn&#x27;t have: a heart&quot;, and Callas was quoted in &quot;Time&quot; magazine as saying that comparing her with Tebaldi was like &quot;comparing Champagne with Cognac ... No ... with Coca Cola&quot;. However, witnesses to the interview stated that Callas had said only &quot;champagne with cognac&quot;, and that it was a bystander who had quipped: &quot;... No ... with Coca-Cola.&quot; Nevertheless, the &quot;Time&quot; reporter attributed the latter comment to Callas.

According to John Ardoin, these two singers never should have been compared. Tebaldi was trained by Carmen Melis, a noted verismo specialist, and she was rooted in the early 20th century Italian school of singing just as firmly as Callas was rooted in 19th century bel canto. Callas was a dramatic soprano, whereas Tebaldi was considered essentially a lyric soprano. Callas and Tebaldi generally sang a different repertoire: In the early years of her career, Callas concentrated on the heavy dramatic soprano roles and later in her career on the bel canto repertoire, whereas Tebaldi concentrated on late Verdi and verismo roles, where her limited upper extension and her lack of a florid technique were not issues. They shared a few roles, including Tosca in Puccini&#x27;s opera and &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, which Tebaldi performed only late in her career.

The alleged rivalry aside, Callas made remarks appreciative of Tebaldi, and vice versa. During an interview with Norman Ross Jr. in Chicago, Callas said, &quot;I admire Tebaldi&#x27;s tone; it&#x27;s beautiful—also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice.&quot; Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of &quot;La Gioconda&quot; in order to help her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry, he recommended Zinka Milanov&#x27;s version. A few days later, he went to visit Tebaldi, only to find her sitting by the speakers, listening intently to Callas&#x27;s recording. She then looked up at him and asked, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you tell me Maria&#x27;s was the best?&quot;

Callas visited Tebaldi after a performance of &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; at the Met in 1968, and the two were reunited. In 1978, Tebaldi spoke warmly of her late colleague and summarized this rivalry:
This rivality was really building from the people of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don&#x27;t know why they put this kind of rivality, because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.

==Vocal decline==
In the opinion of several singers, the heavy roles undertaken in her early years damaged Callas&#x27;s voice. The mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato, Callas&#x27;s close friend and frequent colleague, stated that she told Callas that she felt that the early heavy roles led to a weakness in the diaphragm and subsequent difficulty in controlling the upper register.

Louise Caselotti, who worked with Callas in 1946 and 1947, prior to her Italian debut, felt that it was not the heavy roles that hurt Callas&#x27;s voice, but the lighter ones. Several singers have suggested that Callas&#x27;s heavy use of the chest voice led to stridency and unsteadiness with the high notes. In his book, Callas&#x27;s husband Meneghini wrote that Callas suffered an unusually early onset of menopause, which could have affected her voice. Soprano Carol Neblett once said, &quot;A woman sings with her ovaries—you&#x27;re only as good as your hormones.&quot;

Critic Henry Pleasants has stated that it was a loss of physical strength and breath-support that led to Callas&#x27;s vocal problems, saying,Singing, and especially opera singing, requires physical strength. Without it, the singer&#x27;s respiratory functions can no longer support the steady emissions of breath essential to sustaining the production of focused tone. The breath escapes, but it is no longer the power behind the tone, or is only partially and intermittently. The result is a breathy sound—tolerable but hardly beautiful—when the singer sings lightly, and a voice spread and squally when under pressure.

In the same vein, Joan Sutherland, who heard Callas throughout the 1950s, said in a BBC interview,
[Hearing Callas in &quot;Norma&quot; in 1952] was a shock, a wonderful shock. You just got shivers up and down the spine. It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances, before she lost weight. I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of &quot;fatness&quot; of the sound which she had when she was as fat as she was. But when she lost the weight, she couldn&#x27;t seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don&#x27;t think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.

Michael Scott has proposed that Callas&#x27;s loss of strength and breath support was directly caused by her rapid and progressive weight loss, something that was noted even in her prime. Of her 1958 recital in Chicago, Robert Detmer wrote, &quot;There were sounds fearfully uncontrolled, forced beyond the too-slim singer&#x27;s present capacity to support or sustain.&quot;

Photos and videos of Callas during her heavy era show a very upright posture with the shoulders relaxed and held back. Of a television broadcast from May 1960 of a recital in Hamburg, &quot;The Opera Quarterly&quot; noted, &quot;[W]e [can] watch ... the constantly sinking, depressed chest and hear the resulting deterioration&quot;. This continual change in posture has been cited as visual proof of a progressive loss of breath support.

Commercial and bootleg recordings of Callas from the late 1940s to 1953—the period during which she sang the heaviest dramatic soprano roles—show no decline in the fabric of the voice, no loss in volume and no unsteadiness or shrinkage in the upper register. Of her December 1952 Lady Macbeth—coming after five years of singing the most strenuous dramatic soprano repertoire—Peter Dragadze wrote for &quot;Opera&quot;, &quot;Callas&#x27; voice since last season has improved a great deal, the second passagio on the high B-natural and C has now completely cleared, giving her an equally colored scale from top to bottom.&quot; And of her performance of Medea a year later, John Ardoin writes, &quot;The performance displays Callas in as secure and free a voice as she will be found at any point in her career. The many top B&#x27;s have a brilliant ring, and she handles the treacherous tessitura like an eager thoroughbred.&quot;

In recordings from 1954 (immediately after her weight loss) and thereafter, &quot;not only would the instrument lose its warmth and become thin and acidulous, but the altitudinous passages would to her no longer come easily.&quot; It was at this time that unsteady top notes first begin to appear. Walter Legge, who produced nearly all of Callas&#x27;s EMI/Angel recordings, states that Callas &quot;ran into a patch of vocal difficulties as early as 1954&quot;: during the recording of &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, done immediately after the weight loss, the &quot;wobble had become so pronounced&quot; that he told Callas they &quot;would have to give away seasickness pills with every side&quot;.

There were others, however, who felt that the voice had benefitted from the weight loss. Of her performance of &quot;Norma&quot; in Chicago in 1954, Claudia Cassidy wrote that &quot;there is a slight unsteadiness in some of the sustained upper notes, but to me her voice is more beautiful in color, more even through the range, than it used to be&quot;. And at her performance of the same opera in London in 1957 (her first performance at Covent Garden after the weight loss), critics again felt her voice had changed for the better, that it had now supposedly become a more precise instrument, with a new focus. Many of her most critically acclaimed appearances are from 1954–1958 (&quot;Norma&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Sonnambula&quot; and &quot;Lucia&quot; of 1955, &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; of 1957, &quot;Medea&quot; of 1958, among others).

Callas&#x27;s close friend and colleague Tito Gobbi thought that her vocal problems all stemmed from her state of mind:
I don&#x27;t think anything happened to her voice. I think she only lost confidence. She was at the top of a career that a human being could desire, and she felt enormous responsibility. She was obliged to give her best every night, and maybe she felt she wasn&#x27;t [able] any more, and she lost confidence. I think this was the beginning of the end of this career.

In support of Gobbi&#x27;s assertion, a bootleg recording of Callas rehearsing Beethoven&#x27;s aria &quot;Ah! perfido&quot; and parts of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot; shortly before her death shows her voice to be in much better shape than much of her 1960s recordings and far healthier than the 1970s concerts with Giuseppe Di Stefano.

Soprano Renée Fleming posited that videos of Callas in the late 1950s and early 1960s reveal a posture that betrays breath-support problems:
I have a theory about what caused her vocal decline, but it&#x27;s more from watching her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It&#x27;s not the weight loss &quot;per se&quot;—you know, Deborah Voigt has lost a lot of weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it&#x27;s suddenly gone and one doesn&#x27;t develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can&#x27;t estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [allowed her] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.

However, writing about dramatic soprano Deborah Voigt in 2006 shortly after her weight loss after gastric bypass surgery, music critic Peter G. Davis brings up comparisons with Callas and notes an increasing acidity and thinning in Voigt&#x27;s voice that recall the changes in Callas&#x27;s voice after her weight loss:
A change has also come over Voigt&#x27;s voice lately, though it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas&#x27; drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet exhibits any of Callas&#x27; technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi&#x27;s La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality at the very center of the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.

Voigt explained how her dramatic weight loss affected her breathing and breath support:
Much of what I did with my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I&#x27;ve got a different body—there&#x27;s not as much of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do have to think about it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra whhoomf! Now it doesn&#x27;t do that. If I don&#x27;t remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that&#x27;s when you can&#x27;t get your phrase, you crack high notes.

Callas attributed her problems to a loss of confidence brought about by a loss of breath support, even though she does not make the connection between her weight and her breath support. In an April 1977 interview with journalist , she stated,
My best recordings were made when I was skinny, and I say skinny, not slim, because I worked a lot and couldn&#x27;t gain weight back; I became even too skinny ... I had my greatest successes – &quot;Lucia&quot;, &quot;Sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; – when I was skinny as a nail. Even for my first time here in Paris in 1958 when the show was broadcast through Eurovision, I was skinny. Really skinny.&quot;

And shortly before her death, Callas confided her own thoughts on her vocal problems to Peter Dragadze:
I never lost my voice, but I lost strength in my diaphragm. ... Because of those organic complaints, I lost my courage and boldness. My vocal cords were and still are in excellent condition, but my &#x27;sound boxes&#x27; have not been working well even though I have been to all the doctors. The result was that I overstrained my voice, and that caused it to wobble. (&quot;Gente&quot;, October 1, 1977)

Whether Callas&#x27;s vocal decline was due to ill health, early menopause, over-use and abuse of her voice, loss of breath-support, loss of confidence, or weight loss will continue to be debated. Whatever the cause may have been, her singing career was effectively over by age 40, and even at the time of her death at age 53, according to Walter Legge, &quot;she ought still to have been singing magnificently&quot;.

===Fussi and Paolillo report===
A 2010 study by Italian vocal researchers Franco Fussi and Nico Paolillo revealed Callas was very ill at the time of her death and her illness was related to her vocal deterioration. According to their findings, presented at the University of Bologna in 2010, Callas had dermatomyositis, a rare, connective tissue disease that causes a failure of the muscles and ligaments, including the larynx. They believe she was showing signs of this disease as early as the 1960s. Fussi and Paolillo cite an initial report by physician Mario Giacovazzo, who in 2002 revealed he had diagnosed Callas with dermatomyositis in 1975. Treatment included corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, which affect heart function.

At an event hosted by the journal &quot;Il Saggiatore Musicale&quot;, Fussi and Paolillo presented documentation showing when and how her voice changed over time. Using modern audio technology, they analyzed live Callas studio recordings from the 1950s through the 1970s, looking for signs of deterioration. Spectrographic analysis showed that she was losing the top half of her range. Fussi observed video recordings in which Callas&#x27;s posture seemed strained and weakened. He felt that her drastic weight loss in 1954 further contributed to reduced physical support of her voice.

Fussi and Paolillo also examined restored footage of the infamous 1958 &quot;Norma&quot; &quot;walkout&quot; in Rome, which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage, the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control and that she had bronchitis and tracheitis as she claimed, and that the dermatomyositis was already causing her muscles to deteriorate.

==Scandals and later career==
The latter half of Callas&#x27;s career was marked by a number of scandals. Following a performance of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in Chicago in 1955, Callas was confronted by a process server who handed her papers about a lawsuit brought by Eddy Bagarozy, who claimed he was her agent. Callas was photographed with her mouth turned in a furious snarl. The photo was sent around the world and gave rise to the myth of Callas as a temperamental prima donna and a &quot;Tigress&quot;.

In 1956, just before her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, &quot;Time&quot; ran a damaging cover story about Callas, with special attention paid to her difficult relationship with her mother and some unpleasant exchanges between the two.

In 1957, Callas was starring as Amina in &quot;La sonnambula&quot; at the Edinburgh International Festival with the forces of La Scala. Her contract was for four performances, but due to the great success of the series, La Scala decided to put on a fifth performance. Callas told the La Scala officials that she was physically exhausted and that she had already committed to a previous engagement, a party thrown for her by her friend Elsa Maxwell in Venice. Despite this, La Scala announced a fifth performance, with Callas billed as Amina. Callas refused to stay and went on to Venice. Despite the fact that she had fulfilled her contract, she was accused of walking out on La Scala and the festival. La Scala officials did not defend Callas or inform the press that the additional performance was not approved by Callas. Renata Scotto took over the part, which was the start of her international career.

In January 1958, Callas was to open the Rome Opera House season with &quot;Norma&quot;, with Italy&#x27;s president, Giovanni Gronchi, in attendance. The day before the opening night, Callas alerted the management that she was not well and that they should have a standby ready. She was told &quot;No one can double Callas&quot;. After being treated by doctors, she felt better on the day of performance and decided to go ahead with the opera. A surviving bootleg recording of the first act reveals Callas sounding ill. Feeling that her voice was slipping away, she felt that she could not complete the performance, and consequently, she cancelled after the first act. She was accused of walking out on the president of Italy in a fit of temperament, and pandemonium broke out. Doctors confirmed that Callas had bronchitis and tracheitis, and the President&#x27;s wife called to tell her they knew she was sick. However, they made no statements to the media, and the endless stream of press coverage aggravated the situation.

A newsreel included file footage of Callas from 1955 sounding well, intimating the footage was of rehearsals for the Rome &quot;Norma&quot;, with the voiceover narration, &quot;Here she is in rehearsal, sounding perfectly healthy&quot;, followed by &quot;If you want to hear Callas, don&#x27;t get all dressed up. Just go to a rehearsal; she usually stays to the end of those.&quot;

Callas&#x27;s relationship with La Scala had also started to become strained after the Edinburgh incident, and this effectively severed her major ties with her artistic home. Later in 1958, Callas and Rudolf Bing were in discussion about her season at the Met. She was scheduled to perform in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; and in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, two very different operas which almost require totally different singers. Callas and the Met could not reach an agreement, and before the opening of &quot;Medea&quot; in Dallas, Bing sent a telegram to Callas terminating her contract. Headlines of &quot;Bing Fires Callas&quot; appeared in newspapers around the world. Nicola Rescigno later recalled, &quot;That night, she came to the theater, looking like an empress: she wore an ermine thing that draped to the floor, and she had every piece of jewellery she ever owned. And she said, &#x27;You all know what&#x27;s happened. Tonight, for me, is a very difficult night, and I will need the help of every one of you.&#x27; Well, she proceeded to give a performance [of &quot;Medea&quot;] that was historical.&quot;

Bing later said that Callas was the most difficult artist he ever worked with, &quot;because she was so much more intelligent. Other artists, you could get around. But Callas you could not get around. She knew exactly what she wanted, and why she wanted it.&quot; Despite this, Bing&#x27;s admiration for Callas never wavered, and in September 1959, he sneaked into La Scala in order to listen to Callas record &quot;La Gioconda&quot; for EMI. Callas and Bing reconciled in the mid 1960s, and Callas returned to the Met for two performances of &quot;Tosca&quot; with her friend Tito Gobbi.

In her final years as a singer, she sang in &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;Norma&quot;, and &quot;Tosca&quot; in Paris, New York, and London from January–February 1964. Her last stage performance was July 5, 1965, at Covent Garden. A live television transmission of act 2 of the Covent Garden &quot;Tosca&quot; of 1964 was broadcast in Britain on February 9, 1964, giving a rare view of Callas in performance and of her on-stage collaboration with Tito Gobbi, directed by Carlo Felice Cillario.

In 1969, the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini cast Callas in her only non-operatic acting role, as the Greek mythological character of Medea, in his film by that name. The production was grueling, and according to the account in Ardoin&#x27;s &quot;Callas, the Art and the Life&quot;, Callas is said to have fainted after a day of strenuous running back and forth on a mudflat in the sun. The film was not a commercial success, but as Callas&#x27;s only film appearance, it documents something of her stage presence.

From October 1971 to March 1972, Callas gave a series of master classes at the Juilliard School in New York. These classes later formed the basis of Terrence McNally&#x27;s 1995 play &quot;Master Class&quot;. Callas staged a series of joint recitals in Europe in 1973 and in the U.S., South Korea, and Japan in 1974 with the tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano. Critically, this was a musical disaster owing to both performers&#x27; worn-out voices. However, the tour was an enormous popular success. Audiences thronged to hear the two performers, who had so often appeared together in their prime. Her final public performance was on November 11, 1974, in Sapporo, Japan. Callas and Di Stafano were to have appeared together in four staged performances of &quot;Tosca&quot; in Japan in late 1975 but Callas cancelled.

==Onassis, final years, and death==

In 1957, while still married to husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini, Callas was introduced to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis at a party given in her honor by Elsa Maxwell after a performance in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;. The affair that followed received much publicity in the popular press, and in November 1959, Callas left her husband. Michael Scott asserts that Onassis was not sure why Callas largely abandoned her career, but that he offered her a way out of a career that was made increasingly difficult by scandals and by vocal resources that were diminishing at an alarming rate. Franco Zeffirelli, on the other hand, recalls asking Callas in 1963 why she had not practiced her singing, and Callas responding that &quot;I have been trying to fulfill my life as a woman.&quot;
According to one of her biographers, Nicholas Gage, Callas and Onassis had a child, a boy, who died hours after he was born on March 30, 1960. In his book about his wife, Meneghini states categorically that Maria Callas was unable to bear children. Various sources also dismiss Gage&#x27;s claim, as they note that the birth certificates Gage used to prove this &quot;secret child&quot; were issued in 1998, twenty-one years after Callas&#x27;s death. Still other sources claim that Callas had at least one abortion while involved with Onassis.

In 1966, Callas renounced her U.S. citizenship at the American Embassy in Paris, to facilitate the end of her marriage to Meneghini. This was because after her renunciation, she was only a Greek citizen, and under Greek law of that time, a Greek could legally marry only in a Greek Orthodox church. As she had married in a Roman Catholic church, this divorced her in Greece. The renunciation also helped her finances, as she no longer had to pay U.S. taxes on her income. Her relationship with Onassis ended two years later in 1968, when he left Callas for Jacqueline Kennedy. However, the Onassis family&#x27;s private secretary Kiki writes in her memoir that even while Aristotle was with Jackie, he frequently met with Maria in Paris, where they resumed what had now become a clandestine affair.
Callas spent her last years living largely in isolation in Paris and died of a heart attack at age 53 on September 16, 1977.

A funerary liturgy was held at St Stephen&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Cathedral on rue Georges-Bizet, Paris on September 20, 1977. She was later cremated at the Père Lachaise Cemetery and her ashes were placed in the columbarium there. After being stolen and later recovered, they were scattered over the Aegean Sea, off the coast of Greece, according to her wish, in the spring of 1979.

During a 1978 interview, upon being asked &quot;Was it worth it to Maria Callas? She was a lonely, unhappy, often difficult woman&quot;, music critic and Callas&#x27;s friend John Ardoin replied:That&#x27;s such a difficult question. There are times, you know, when there are people – certain people who are blessed, and cursed, with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. And Callas was one of these people. It was almost as if her wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us all – taught us things about music we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that&#x27;s why singers admire her so; I think that&#x27;s why conductors admire her so; I know that&#x27;s why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don&#x27;t think she always understood what she did or why she did. She knew she had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something that she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her, &quot;It must be very enviable to be Maria Callas.&quot; And she said, &quot;No, it&#x27;s a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it&#x27;s a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand.&quot; Because she couldn&#x27;t explain what she did – it was all done by instinct; it was something, incredibly, embedded deep within her.

=== Estate ===

According to several Callas biographers, Vasso Devetzi, a Greek pianist near the same age as Callas, insinuated herself into Callas&#x27;s trust during her last years and acted virtually as her agent. This claim is corroborated by Iakintha (Jackie) Callas in her 1990 book &quot;Sisters,&quot; wherein she asserts that Devetzi conned Maria out of control of half of her estate while promising to establish the Maria Callas Foundation to provide scholarships for young singers; after hundreds of thousands of dollars had allegedly vanished, Devetzi finally did establish the foundation.

==In popular culture==
* Terrence McNally&#x27;s play &quot;Master Class&quot;, which premiered in 1995, presents Callas as a glamorous, commanding, larger-than-life, caustic, and funny pedagogue holding a voice master class. Alternately dismayed and impressed by the students who parade before her, she retreats into recollections about the glories of her own life and career, culminating in a monologue about sacrifice taken for art. Several selections of Callas actually singing are played during the recollections. Callas was portrayed on Broadway by Zoe Caldwell (1995), Patti LuPone (1996), Dixie Carter (1997), and Tyne Daly (2011). Caldwell won a Tony Award for her performance. Faye Dunaway starred in the 1996 national tour.
* In 2024, American actress Angelina Jolie portrayed Callas in the biopic, &quot;Maria,&quot; directed by Pablo Larraín, which shows Callas in the 1970s during her decline. The film premiered at the 81st Venice International Film Festival where Jolie received a &quot;rapturous&quot; eight-minute standing ovation towards the end of the screening.
* In 1997, she was featured as one of 18 significant historical figures in Apple Inc.&#x27;s Think different advertisement.
* In 2002, Franco Zeffirelli produced and directed a biopic, &quot;Callas Forever&quot;. It was a fictionalized film in which Callas was played by Fanny Ardant. It depicted the last months of Callas&#x27;s life, when she was seduced into the making of a movie of &quot;Carmen&quot;, lip-synching to her 1964 recording of that opera.
* In 2007, Callas was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In the same year, she was voted the greatest soprano of all time by &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot;.
* The 30th anniversary of the death of Maria Callas was selected as the main motif for a high value euro collectors&#x27; coin: the €10 Greek Maria Callas commemorative coin, minted in 2007. Her image is shown in the obverse of the coin, and on the reverse the National Emblem of Greece with her signature is depicted.
* On December 2, 2008, on the 85th anniversary of Callas&#x27;s birth, a group of Greek and Italian officials unveiled a plaque in her honor at Flower Hospital (now the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center) where she was born. Made of Carrara marble and engraved in Italy, the plaque reads, &quot;Maria Callas was born in this hospital on December 2, 1923. These halls heard for the first time the musical notes of her voice, a voice which has conquered the world. To this great interpreter of universal language of music, with gratitude.&quot;
* In 2012, Callas was voted into &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

* In 2017, two books by Tom Volf were released: &quot;Maria by Callas&quot;, punctuated with quotes in English and photos, and &quot;Callas Confidential&quot;. He also set up an exhibition entitled &quot;Maria by Callas&quot; held at La Seine Musicale in Boulogne-Billancourt from September 16 to December 14, 2017. Also in 2017, the documentary directed by Volf &quot;Maria by Callas&quot; was released, which depicts Callas&#x27;s life and work in her own words by using her interviews, letters, and performances to tell her story.
* Several non-operatic singers including Anna Calvi, Linda Ronstadt, and Patti Smith have mentioned Callas as a great musical influence. Opera-turned-pop singer Giselle Bellas cites Callas as an influence; the song &quot;The Canary&quot; from Bellas&#x27;s debut album &quot;Not Ready to Grow Up&quot; was inspired by the relationship between Callas and Onassis. Other popular musicians have paid tribute to Callas in their music:
*Enigma released the instrumental &quot;Callas Went Away&quot; using samples of Callas&#x27;s voice, on their 1990 album &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;
*&quot;La diva&quot;, on Celine Dion&#x27;s 2007 French language album &quot;D&#x27;elles&quot; is about Maria Callas. The track samples the 1956 recording of &quot;La bohème&quot;.
* In the 2018–2019 season, BASE Hologram Productions presented Callas in Concert in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Europe.
* In 2019, Volf&#x27;s book &quot;Maria Callas: Lettres &amp; Mémoires&quot; (&quot;Maria Callas: Letters &amp; Memoirs&quot;) was released, based on letters and autobiography essays left by the singer.
* Monica Bellucci played Callas for an evocation telling the singer&#x27;s story through her own letters and words in a theater show directed by Volf, &quot;Maria Callas&#x27; Letters and Memoirs&quot;, which began at the end of November 2019 at the Théâtre Marigny in Paris, continuing throughout Europe, including the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, and ending in Los Angeles and New York City in January 2023 at the Beacon Theatre. In the play, Bellucci wore two Yves Saint Laurent dresses that had belonged to Callas.
* In 2021, the first annual Maria Callas Monaco Gala &amp; Award, organized under the High Patronage of HSH Albert II, Prince of Monaco, was held at the Hôtel de Paris in Monte Carlo.
* In October 2021, a 1.8 metre-tall statue of Callas at the base of the Acropolis in Athens, created by Aphrodite Liti, was &quot;ridiculed in cartoons and generated a social media storm&quot;.
* In November 2021, Spanish actress Mabel del Pozo played Maria Callas in the successful play &quot;Maria Callas, sfogato&quot;, written by Pedro Víllora.
* In June 2024, Callas was inducted posthumously into the Women Songwriters Hall of Fame.

It is her only performance of the role, and her only performance of the complete opera; she never appeared in it onstage. The recording used the recitatives added after Bizet&#x27;s death.

<text>Cabbage Patch Kids are a line of cloth dolls with plastic heads first produced by Coleco Industries in 1982. They were inspired by the Little People soft sculptured dolls sold by Xavier Roberts as collectibles. The brand was renamed &#x27;Cabbage Patch Kids&#x27; by Roger L. Schlaifer when he acquired the exclusive worldwide licensing rights in 1982.

The doll brand set every toy industry sales record for three years running, was one of the most popular lines of children&#x27;s licensed products in the 1980s, and has become one of the longest-running doll franchises in the United States. Additional Cabbage Patch products include children&#x27;s apparel, bedding, infants&#x27; wear, record albums and board games.

==Production history==

===Creation and development===
According to court records, Roberts, a 21-year-old art student at a missionary school in North Georgia, discovered craft artist Martha Nelson&#x27;s Doll Babies. They came with a birth certificate and adoption papers. With the help of artist Debbie Moorehead, he hand-stitched dolls called &quot;The Little People&quot;. Roberts modified the look of Nelson&#x27;s dolls, birth certificate and adoption papers sufficiently to get a copyright, and told potential customers his Little People were not for sale; however, they could be &quot;adopted&quot; for prices ranging from $60 to $1,000.

The Little People were first sold at arts and crafts shows, then later at Babyland General Hospital, an old medical clinic that Roberts and his friends-turned-employees converted into a toy store, in Cleveland, Georgia.

In 1981, at the height of Roberts&#x27;s success, he was approached by Atlanta designer and licensing agent, Roger L. Schlaifer about licensing The Little People. As Fisher-Price owned the name &quot;Little People&quot;, the name was changed to &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids.&quot; His goal was to build the first and largest mass-market children&#x27;s brand in history. In order to attract potential doll manufacturers and to create the entertainment and publishing businesses he envisioned, Schlaifer and his partner/wife wrote the &quot;Legend of the Cabbage Patch Kids&quot;. To make sense of how special cabbages gave birth to Cabbage Patch Kids, Schlaifer invented the bee-like creatures that use their rabbit ears to fly about and pollinate cabbages with magical crystals. Since Roberts insisted on being a character in the story, Schlaifer created him as a curious ten-year-old boy who discovered the Cabbage Patch Kids by following a BunnyBee behind a waterfall into a magical Cabbage Patch, where he found the Cabbage Patch babies being born in a neglected garden. To save them from being abducted to work in the gold mines operated by the villainess Lavender McDade and her two cohorts in crime, Cabbage Jack and Beau Weasel, young Roberts tried to save them by finding loving parents who would adopt them and keep them safe in their homes.

In 1982, Coleco&#x27;s design team, headed by famed doll designer Judy Albert, devised an industry first: one-of-a-kind, plastic-headed Cabbage Patch Kids dolls with cuter features, softer bodies and a normal toddler&#x27;s proportions instead of the obese bodies of Roberts&#x27; originals. It was those comparatively inexpensive ($18 to $28) dolls, branded in packaging designed by Schlaifer and produced in Coleco&#x27;s factories in China, that succeeded commercially. Coleco cancelled all of its advertising as they tried to keep up with demand—shipping a doll-industry record, 3.2 million dolls. Sales of dolls in 1984, along with Cabbage Patch branded merchandise generated $2,000,000,000 in retail sales across North America, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

Coleco&#x27;s sales continued to climb right through 1986, when they reportedly over-shipped and lost ground in a legal battle with Schlaifer and Roberts over his introduction of &quot;Furskins a collection of hillbilly bears that competed with the Cabbage Patch dolls. Coleco&#x27;s sales plummeted from over $800 million in 1986 to nothing in 1988 when the company went out of business.

===Coleco years===

After changing the dolls&#x27; name to Cabbage Patch Kids, Schlaifer contacted all the major doll companies in the country. Most declined, commenting that the look of the Little People was too ugly to sell on the mass-market. Coleco, then famous for its success with electronic toys, were sold on becoming the Master Toy licensee, including an advertising guarantee.

At the peak of their popularity, between 1983 and 1986, the dolls were highly sought-after toys for Christmas. Cabbage Patch riots occurred as parents literally fought to obtain the dolls for children. In later years, Coleco introduced variants on the original Cabbage Patch Kids, and derivatives of the original line of dolls continued to be marketed.

===International variations===
When Coleco was producing the dolls for the North American market during the 1980s, they provided technical assistance to other doll manufacturers in Panama, Europe, Australia and Japan who wanted to use their molds.

===Hasbro years===
Hasbro took over the rights to produce Cabbage Patch dolls in 1988 after Coleco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and continued to make the dolls with various gimmicks, including dolls that played kazoos. Some of the more popular doll lines to come out under the Cabbage Patch Kids name included the &quot;Birthday Kids&quot;, &quot;Splash &#x27;n&#x27; Tan Kids&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Crimp and Curl&quot;. Hasbro produced a 10th anniversary doll, reintroducing Schlaifer&#x27;s original packaging – a practice that other CPK doll manufacturers would do to give sales a boost on various anniversaries. Hasbro gradually began making the dolls for younger children, which led to smaller and smaller dolls.

===Mattel years===
In 1994, Mattel acquired the licensing rights to the dolls from Original Appalachian Artworks. Their first Cabbage Patch dolls hit the stores in 1995.

The Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls were not limited to cloth bodies and included dolls made from vinyl, resulting in a more durable play doll. The Mattel dolls are mostly sized 14&quot; or smaller, and most variants were individualized with a gimmick to enhance their collectibility, e.g. some dolls played on water toys, swam, ate food, or brushed their teeth.

Some Mattel lines include the updated Kids line of basic cloth dolls that came with birth certificates, the OlympiKids that were made to coincide with the 1996 Olympics, and the Cabbage Patch Fairies. In January 1997, Mattel recalled the franchise&#x27;s Snacktime Kids dolls after numerous complaints that they were chewing on children&#x27;s hair and fingers. Also, to celebrate the dolls&#x27; 15th anniversary, Mattel created a line of exclusively female dolls with reproduction face molds, dressed in a reproduction dresses reminiscent of the original line and packaged in retro style box. These were 16 inches tall, the same measurement of the first Coleco Cabbage Kids.

===Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Kids===
In 2001, with Mattel&#x27;s sales stalling, a former Coleco marketing employee, Al Kahn, acquired Original Appalachian&#x27;s licensing rights and sold retailer Toys &quot;R&quot; Us on producing 20-inch (50.8 cm) Kids dolls and 18-inch (45.7 cm) baby dolls, both with cloth bodies and vinyl heads. They were packaged in cardboard cabbage leaf seats. In 2001, the 20-inch dolls debuted in the Times Square flagship store. These were created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the line, and were available both online and in stores around the US. Expensive and deemed too cumbersome for most young children to play with, they did not last long at the retailer.

===Play Along Toys===
Play Along toys next obtained exclusive licensing rights to produce the Cabbage Patch Kids doll line. In 2004, again using Schlaifer&#x27;s original packaging, Play Along launched a Cabbage Patch Kids 25th Anniversary collection using some of the original head sculpts from the very first Coleco editions. Play Along also partnered with Carvel in a co-branding campaign. The resulting co-branded Cabbage Patch Kids were packaged with a Carvel-branded ice cream cone.

===Jakks Pacific===
JAKKS Pacific acquired Play Along Toys and assumed the master toy licensee for the Cabbage Patch Kids in 2011. Jakks introduced a 14-inch (35.6 cm) Cabbage Patch Kids Fashionality line and other Cabbage Patch Kid products. In 2013, Jakks Pacific released the Celebration edition to commemorate the 30th Birthday of the licensed Cabbage Patch Kids. 

===Wicked Cool Toys===
Wicked Cool Toys is the master toy licensee for Cabbage Patch Kids as of 2015.

Wicked Cool Toys released new additions like Little Sprouts, a line of tiny collectable dolls, only 1.5 inches tall. They also released Adoptimals, 8-inch plus pets that a Cabbage Patch Kid can adopt.

==Cabbage Patch Kids brand==
The original 1982 Cabbage Patch Kids license agreement with Coleco Industries was negotiated by Roger L. Schlaifer, doing business as Schlaifer Nance &amp; Company (SN&amp;C), the exclusive worldwide licensor for Original Appalachian Artworks, Roberts&#x27; company at the time.

Following Schlaifer Nance &amp; Company&#x27;s signing of Coleco Industries, SN&amp;C designed and/or directed the design and quality of virtually all CPK branded products produced by its over one hundred and fifty CPK licensed manufacturers, including Coleco. They included the first children&#x27;s licensed character diapers and low-sugar cereal, children&#x27;s apparel, bedding, stationery products, books, backyard pools, and thousands of other children&#x27;s products – generating over $2 billion in retail sales for 1984, alone. Total sales during the Schlaifer&#x27;s six-year tenure exceeded $4.5 billion, more than ten times the total revenues of Cabbage Patch Kids merchandise and entertainment in the thirty years since–the latter of which never made the impact Roberts claimed it would under his direction in the November 1983 edition of Esquire magazine. And while sales of the dolls and other licensed products declined precipitously in the late 1980s, the dolls have become a mainstay of the toy industry, and one of the few long-running doll brands in history.

==Porcelain Cabbage Patch Kids==
These limited edition dolls were available from Applause gifts and later by direct mail from the Danbury Mint. They have a rigid fabric body with porcelain legs, arms, and head.

==Talking Cabbage Patch Kids==
&quot;Talking Cabbage Patch Kids&quot; were among the last new CPK lines introduced by Coleco. They were equipped with a voice chip, touch sensors, a microphone, short range 49 MHz AM transmitter and receiver for communicating with other dolls. Touch sensors in the hands enabled the toy to detect when and how it was being played with in response to its vocalizations. For example, the doll might say &quot;hold my hand&quot; and give an appropriate speech response when the touch sensor in either hand detected pressure. It also had a movement detector to show the positioning of the doll and whether it was sensed to be on its belly, back, or even upside down. A special plastic drinking cup containing a hidden magnet, which could be identified with the aid a small reed relay in the built into the head of the toy above the mouth, to signify when it should be seen to be drinking. A more remarkable effect occurred when one doll detected the presence of another through its 49 MHz AM transmitter/receiver. The dolls were programmed to signal their &quot;awareness&quot; of each other with a short phrase, e.g. &quot;I think there&#x27;s someone else to play with here!&quot;, and then to initiate simple conversations &quot;between the dolls themselves&quot; with enough randomness to sound somewhat natural, the joint synchronised singing of &#x27;rounds&#x27; being particularly impressive. The inclusion of the microphone was to delay the search and communication with another of its type when the ambient noise was above a certain level.

==Babyland General Hospital==
Babyland General Hospital is the &quot;birthplace&quot; of Little People and is located in Cleveland, Georgia. With the help of local friends, Roberts converted an old doctor&#x27;s clinic into a general store/souvenir shop and &quot;doll hospital&quot; from which to sell his original &quot;Little People&quot;. The facility is presented as a birthing, nursery, and adoption center for the Cabbage Patch Kids. In accordance with the theme, employees dressed and pretended to be doctors and nurses caring for the dolls as if they were real. Babyland General moved to a new facility on the outskirts of Cleveland, Georgia, in 2010 and has been voted one of the Travel Channel&#x27;s top 10 toylands.

==Adaptations==
===The Cabbage Patch Kids&#x27; First Christmas===

Under the direction of ABC V.P. of programming, Squire Rushnell, and produced by Ruby-Spears with music by Joe Raposo, &quot;The Cabbage Patch Kids&#x27; First Christmas&quot;, premiered on ABC on December 7, 1984, and was the top-rated show in its time-slot.

It was followed by four other stop-motion animated specials, &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids: The Club House&quot; in 1996; &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids: The Screen Test&quot; in 1997; &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids: Saturday Night&quot; in 1998; and &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids: Vernon&#x27;s Christmas&quot; in 1999.

Roberts rejected an offer from ABC for an hour Saturday show combining Cabbage Patch Kids and Furskins Bears.

In 2024, MeTV Toons aired the Christmas special as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;Tis&#x27; the Season for Toons&quot; event.

==Controversies==
=== Lawsuits ===
Though Xavier Roberts originated the look of Little People, many of Little People&#x27;s defining characteristics – such as the dolls&#x27; overly round faces and that they came with an adoption certificate – were taken from Martha Nelson Thomas, an American folk artist from Kentucky. Before Roberts became involved in the toy industry, Thomas had created and marketed her own line of dolls, called Doll Babies, which she sold at local arts and craft shows and markets. Roberts began purchasing Thomas&#x27; dolls in 1976 to sell at a profit at his own store in Georgia. Thomas later stopped selling additional dolls to Roberts, prompting him to turn to a manufacturing company in Hong Kong to mass produce dolls similar in appearance to Thomas&#x27; at a cheaper cost. Thomas brought suit against Roberts and eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in 1985. She and her husband, Tucker Thomas, told the press that she was more upset by the corruption of her dolls, for which she cared deeply, than the money she&#x27;d lost as the result of Roberts&#x27; actions. Thomas died in 2013, at the age of 62, with her favorite dolls attending her funeral alongside her family members and friends.

Roberts&#x27; company, Original Appalachian Artworks, later brought a $30 million lawsuit against Topps, the company that produced grotesque trading cards parodying his company&#x27;s dolls called the Garbage Pail Kids, for copyright infringement. Having sold over $70 million worth of the cards, Topps settled with OAA for $7 million—tantamount to a license—and retained the right to continue producing the Garbage Pail Kids cards.

In a bitter legal battle with SN&amp;C over whether OAA had violated their licensing Agreement with SN&amp;C and Coleco&#x27;s exclusivity by producing a Cabbage Patch bear as a line of &quot;Furskins Bears&quot;, and failing to pay SN&amp;C its share of the Topps settlement and refusing to allow ABC TV from doing a Saturday morning animated TV show, Roberts worked out a side deal with Coleco for tens of millions of dollars for a renewal of Schlaifer&#x27;s Cabbage Patch agreement, and jointly litigated against SN&amp;C. The suit was settled in 1988 by OAA and Coleco paying SN&amp;C an undisclosed amount of money. In addition, Paula Osborne, OAA president until Roberts worked out the deal with Coleco, sued over the share she was entitled to as a stockholder of OAA and received a seven-figure settlement. Six months after settling with SN&amp;C, Coleco was out of business.

=== Product safety ===
One of Mattel&#x27;s line of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids, was designed to &quot;eat&quot; plastic snacks. The mechanism enabling this was a pair of one-way smooth metal rollers behind plastic lips. The snacks would exit the doll&#x27;s back and &quot;magically&quot; appear into a backpack. The mechanism could be de-activated by releasing the backpack. They were extremely popular during Christmas 1996. The line was voluntarily withdrawn from the market following an agreement between Mattel and the Consumer Product Safety Commission in January 1997 following several incidents where children got their fingers or hair stuck in the dolls&#x27; mouths leading to safety warnings from Connecticut&#x27;s consumer protection commissioner, Mark Shiffrin.

<text>Year 337 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Longus and Paetus (or, less frequently, year 417 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 337 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* At a Pan-Hellenic Conference in Corinth, Philip II of Macedon announces the formation of the League of Corinth to liberate the Greek cities of Asia Minor from Persian rule, ostensibly because the Persian King, Arses, refuses to make reparations to Philip for Artaxerxes III&#x27;s aid to the city of Perinthus when it was resisting Philip. All the Greek cities (except Sparta) and the Greek islands swear their support to the league and to recognise Philip as president of the League. Philip establishes a council of representatives from all the Greek states, which is empowered to deliberate and decide on the actions to be taken. However, the real power lies with Philip who is declared commander of the League&#x27;s army.
* Olympias is put aside by her husband Philip II, following Philip&#x27;s marriage to a girl named Cleopatra (who is renamed Eurydice). Their son, Alexander, is effectively disowned by Philip&#x27;s actions. Philip II has Ptolemy, along with other companions of his son, exiled.

==== Roman Republic ====
* A plebeian is chosen to be praetor of Rome for the first time.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Demetrius I Poliorcetes (&quot;Besieger&quot;), Antigonid dynasty king of Macedon (d. 283 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Approximate date – Timoleon, Greek statesman and general (b. c. 411 BC)
* Shen Pu-hai, Chinese bureaucrat, chief minister of Han

<text>Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to fence off more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation&#x27;s 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go, and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.

The playing pieces are called &quot;stones&quot;. One player uses the white stones and the other black. The players take turns placing their stones on the vacant intersections (&quot;points&quot;) on the board. Once placed, stones may not be moved, but &quot;captured stones&quot; are immediately removed from the board. A single stone (or connected group of stones) is &quot;captured&quot; when surrounded by the opponent&#x27;s stones on all orthogonally adjacent points. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move.

When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player&#x27;s surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also end by resignation.

The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 or 13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. Boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard, however, by the time the game reached Korea in the 5th century CE and Japan in the 7th century CE.

Go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; ( BCE).

Despite its relatively simple rules, Go is extremely complex. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately , which is far greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which is estimated to be on the order of 1080.

==Names of the game==
The name &quot;Go&quot; is a short form of the Japanese word (; ), which derives from earlier (), in turn from Middle Chinese (, Mandarin: , ). In English, the name &quot;Go&quot; when used for the game is often capitalized to differentiate it from the common word &quot;go&quot;. In events sponsored by the Ing Chang-ki Foundation, it is spelled &quot;goe&quot;.

The Korean name (바둑) derives from the Middle Korean word , the origin of which is controversial; the more plausible etymologies include the suffix added to to mean &#x27;flat and wide board&#x27;, or the joining of , meaning &#x27;field&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;stone&#x27;. Less plausible etymologies include a derivation of , referring to the playing pieces of the game, or a derivation from Chinese (), meaning &#x27;to arrange pieces&#x27;.

== Overview ==
Go is an adversarial game between two players with the objective of capturing territory. That is, occupying and surrounding a larger total empty area of the board with one&#x27;s stones than the opponent. As the game progresses, the players place stones on the board creating stone &quot;formations&quot; and enclosing spaces. Stones are never moved on the board, but when &quot;captured&quot; are removed from the board. Stones are linked together into a formation by being adjacent along the black lines, not on diagonals (of which there are none). Contests between opposing formations are often extremely complex and may result in the expansion, reduction, or wholesale capture and loss of formations and their enclosed empty spaces (called &quot;eyes&quot;). Another essential component of the game is control of the &quot;sente&quot; (that is, controlling the offense, so that one&#x27;s opponent is forced into defensive moves); this usually changes several times during play.
Initially the board is bare, and players alternate turns to place one stone per turn. As the game proceeds, players try to link their stones together into &quot;living&quot; formations (meaning that they are permanently safe from capture), as well as threaten to capture their opponent&#x27;s stones and formations. Stones have both offensive and defensive characteristics, depending on the situation.

An essential concept is that a formation of stones must have, or be capable of making, at least two enclosed open points known as &quot;eyes&quot; to preserve itself from being captured. A formation having at least two eyes cannot be captured, even after it is surrounded by the opponent on the outside, because each eye constitutes a &quot;liberty&quot; that must be filled by the opponent as the final step in capture. A formation having two or more eyes is said to be unconditionally &quot;alive&quot;, so it can evade capture indefinitely, and a group that cannot form two eyes is said to be &quot;dead&quot; and can be captured. 

The general strategy is to place stones to fence-off territory, attack the opponent&#x27;s weak groups (trying to kill them so they will be removed), and always stay mindful of the life status of one&#x27;s own groups. The liberties of groups are countable. Situations where mutually opposing groups must capture each other or die are called capturing races, or semeai. In a capturing race, the group with more liberties will ultimately be able to capture the opponent&#x27;s stones. Capturing races and the elements of life or death are the primary challenges of Go.

In the end game players may pass rather than place a stone if they think there are no further opportunities for profitable play. The game ends when both players pass or when one player resigns. In general, to score the game, each player counts the number of unoccupied points surrounded by their stones and then subtracts the number of stones that were captured by the opponent. The player with the greater score (after adjusting for handicapping called komi) wins the game.

In the opening stages of the game, players typically establish groups of stones (or &quot;bases&quot;) near the corners and around the sides of the board, usually starting on the third or fourth line in from the board edge rather than at the very edge of the board. The edges and corners make it easier to develop groups which have better options for &quot;life&quot; (self-viability for a group of stones that prevents capture) and establish formations for potential territory. Players usually start near the corners because establishing territory is easier with the aid of two edges of the board. Established corner opening sequences are called joseki and are often studied independently. However, in the mid-game, stone groups must also reach in towards the large central area of the board to capture more territory.

Dame are points that lie in between the boundary walls of black and white, and as such are considered to be of no value to either side. Seki are mutually alive pairs of white and black groups where neither has two eyes.

&quot;Ko&quot; (Chinese and Japanese: ) is a potentially indefinitely repeated stone-capture position. The rules do not allow a board position to be repeated. Therefore, any move which would restore the previous board position would not be allowed, and the next player would be forced to play somewhere else. If the play requires a strategic response by the first player, further changing the board, then the second player could &quot;retake the ko,&quot; and the first player would be in the same situation of needing to change the board before trying to take the ko back. And so on. Some of these &quot;ko fights&quot; may be important and decide the life of a large group, while others may be worth just one or two points. Some ko fights are referred to as &quot;picnic kos&quot; when only one side has a lot to lose. In Japanese, it is called a &quot;hanami&quot; ko.

Playing with others usually requires a knowledge of each player&#x27;s strength, indicated by the player&#x27;s rank (increasing from 30 kyu to 1 kyu, then 1 dan to 7 dan, then 1 dan pro to 9 dan pro). A difference in rank may be compensated by a handicap—Black is allowed to place two or more stones on the board to compensate for White&#x27;s greater strength. There are different rulesets (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, AGA, etc.), which are almost entirely equivalent, except for certain special-case positions and the method of scoring at the end.

=== Basic concepts ===
Basic strategic aspects include the following:
* Connection: Keeping one&#x27;s own stones connected means that fewer groups need to make living shape, and one has fewer groups to defend.
* Cut: Keeping opposing stones disconnected means that the opponent needs to defend and make living shape for more groups.
* Stay alive: The simplest way to stay alive is to establish a foothold in the corner or along one of the sides. At a minimum, a group must have two eyes (separate open points) to be alive. An opponent cannot fill in either eye, as any such move is suicidal and prohibited in the rules.
* Mutual life (seki) is better than dying: A situation in which neither player can play on a particular point without then allowing the other player to play at another point to capture. The most common example is that of adjacent groups that share their last few liberties—if either player plays in the shared liberties, they can reduce their own group to a single liberty (putting themselves in &quot;atari&quot;), allowing their opponent to capture it on the next move.
* Death: A group that lacks living shape is eventually removed from the board as captured.
* Invasion: Set up a new living group inside an area where the opponent has greater influence, means one reduces the opponent&#x27;s score in proportion to the area one occupies.
* Reduction: Placing a stone far enough into the opponent&#x27;s area of influence to reduce the amount of territory they eventually get, but not so far that it can be cut off from friendly stones outside.
* Sente: A play that forces one&#x27;s opponent to respond (gote). A player who can regularly play &quot;sente&quot; has the initiative and can control the flow of the game.
* Sacrifice: Allowing a group to die in order to carry out a play, or plan, in a more important area.

The strategy involved can become very abstract and complex. High-level players spend years improving their understanding of strategy, and a novice may play many hundreds of games against opponents before being able to win regularly.

== Strategy ==
Strategy deals with global influence, the interaction between distant stones, keeping the whole board in mind during local fights, and other issues that involve the overall game. It is therefore possible to allow a tactical loss when it confers a strategic advantage.

Novices often start by randomly placing stones on the board, as if it were a game of chance. An understanding of how stones connect for greater power develops, and then a few basic common opening sequences may be understood. Learning the ways of life and death helps in a fundamental way to develop one&#x27;s strategic understanding of &quot;weak groups&quot;. A player who both plays aggressively and can handle adversity is said to display kiai, or fighting spirit, in the game.

=== Opening strategy ===

In the opening of the game, players usually play and gain territory in the corners of the board first, as the presence of two edges makes it easier for them to surround territory and establish the eyes they need. From a secure position in a corner, it is possible to lay claim to more territory by extending along the side of the board. The opening is the most theoretically difficult part of the game and takes a large proportion of professional players&#x27; thinking time. The first stone played at a corner of the board is generally placed on the third or fourth line from the edge. Players tend to play on or near the 4–4 star point during the opening. Playing nearer to the edge does not produce enough territory to be efficient, and playing further from the edge does not safely secure the territory.

In the opening, players often play established sequences called joseki, which are locally balanced exchanges; however, the joseki chosen should also produce a satisfactory result on a global scale. It is generally advisable to keep a balance between territory and influence. Which of these gets precedence is often a matter of individual taste.

=== Middlegame and endgame ===
The middle phase of the game is the most combative, and usually lasts for more than 100 moves. During the middlegame, the players invade each other&#x27;s territories, and attack formations that lack the necessary &quot;two eyes&quot; for viability. Such groups may be saved or sacrificed for something more significant on the board. It is possible that one player may succeed in capturing a large weak group of the opponent&#x27;s, which often proves decisive and ends the game by a resignation. However, matters may be more complex yet, with major trade-offs, apparently dead groups reviving, and skillful play to attack in such a way as to construct territories rather than kill.

The end of the middlegame and transition to the endgame is marked by a few features. Near the end of a game, play becomes divided into localized fights that do not affect each other, with the exception of &quot;ko&quot; fights, where before the central area of the board related to all parts of it. No large weak groups are still in serious danger. Moves can reasonably be attributed some definite value, such as 20 points or fewer, rather than simply being necessary to compete. Both players set limited objectives in their plans, in making or destroying territory, capturing or saving stones. These changing aspects of the game usually occur at much the same time, for strong players. In brief, the middlegame switches into the endgame when the concepts of strategy and influence need reassessment in terms of concrete final results on the board.

== Rules ==

Aside from the order of play (alternating moves, Black moves first or takes a handicap) and scoring rules, there are essentially only two rules in Go:
* Liberty rule states that &quot;every stone remaining on the board must have at least one open point (a &quot;liberty&quot;) directly orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right)&quot;, or &quot;must be part of a connected group that has at least one such open point (liberty) next to it. Stones or groups of stones which lose their last liberty are removed from the board.&quot;
* Repetition Rule (the ko rule) states that &quot;a stone on the board must never immediately repeat a previous position of a captured stone, thus only a move elsewhere on the board is permitted that turn.&quot; Since without this rule such a pattern of the two players repeating their prior moves (capturing stones in same places) could continue indefinitely, this rule prevents a stalemate.

Almost all other information about how the game is played is heuristic, meaning it is learned information about how the patterns of the stones on the board function, rather than a rule. Other rules are specialized, as they come about through different rulesets, but the above two rules cover almost all of any played game.

Although there are some minor differences between rulesets used in different countries, most notably in Chinese and Japanese scoring rules, these differences do not greatly affect the tactics and strategy of the game.

Except where noted, the basic rules presented here are valid independent of the scoring rules used. The scoring rules are explained separately. Go terms for which there is no ready English equivalent are commonly called by their Japanese names.

=== Basic rules ===

The two players, Black and White, take turns placing stones of their color on the intersections of the board, one stone at a time. The usual board size is a 19×19 grid, but for beginners or for playing quick games, the smaller board sizes of 13×13 and 9×9 are also popular.
The board is empty to begin with. Black plays first unless given a handicap of two or more stones, in which case White plays first. The players may choose any unoccupied intersection to play on except for those forbidden by the ko and suicide rules (see below). Once played, a stone can never be moved and can be taken off the board only if it is captured. A player may pass their turn, declining to place a stone, though this is usually only done at the end of the game when both players believe nothing more can be accomplished with further play. When both players pass consecutively, the game ends and is then scored.

===Liberties and capture===

Vertically and horizontally adjacent stones of the same color form a chain (also called a &quot;string&quot; or &quot;group&quot;), forming a discrete unit that cannot then be divided. Only stones connected to one another by the lines on the board create a chain; stones that are diagonally adjacent are not connected. Chains may be expanded by placing additional stones on adjacent intersections, and they can be connected together by placing a stone on an intersection that is adjacent to two or more chains of the same color.

A vacant point adjacent to a stone, along one of the grid lines of the board, is called a &quot;liberty&quot; for that stone. Stones in a chain share their liberties. A chain of stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board. When a chain is surrounded by opposing stones so that it has no liberties, it is captured and removed from the board.

=== Ko rule ===


An example of a situation in which the ko rule applies

Players are not allowed to make a move that returns the game to the immediately prior position. This rule, called the ko rule, prevents unending repetition (a stalemate). As shown in the example pictured: White had a stone where the red circle was, and Black has just captured it by playing a stone at 1 (so the White stone has been removed). However, it is readily apparent that now Black&#x27;s stone at 1 is immediately threatened by the three surrounding White stones. If White were allowed to play again on the red circle, it would return the situation to the original one, but the &quot;ko&quot; rule forbids that kind of endless repetition. Thus, White is forced to move elsewhere, or pass. If White wants to recapture Black&#x27;s stone at 1, White must attack Black somewhere else on the board so forcefully that Black moves elsewhere to counter that, giving White that chance. If White&#x27;s forcing move is successful, it is termed &quot;gaining the &quot;sente&quot;&quot;; if Black responds elsewhere on the board, then White can retake Black&#x27;s stone at 1, and the &quot;ko&quot; continues, but this time Black must move elsewhere. A repetition of such exchanges is called a &quot;ko fight&quot;. To stop the potential for &quot;ko fights&quot;, two stones of the same color would need to be added to the group, making either a group of 5 Black or 5 White stones.

While the various rulesets agree on the ko rule prohibiting returning the board to an &quot;immediately&quot; previous position, they deal in different ways with the relatively uncommon situation in which a player might recreate a past position that is further removed. See for further information.

=== Suicide ===
A player may not place a stone such that it or its group immediately has no liberties unless doing so immediately deprives an enemy group of its final liberty. In the second case, the enemy group is captured, leaving the new stone with at least one liberty, so the new stone can be placed. This rule is responsible for the all-important difference between one and two eyes: if a group with only one eye is fully surrounded on the outside, it can be killed with a stone placed in its single eye. (An eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by a group of stones).

The Ing and New Zealand rules do not have this rule, and there a player might destroy one of its own groups (commit suicide). This play would only be useful in limited sets of situations involving a small interior space or planning. In the example at right, it may be useful as a ko threat.

=== Komi ===

Because Black has the advantage of playing the first move, the idea of awarding White some compensation came into being during the 20th century. This is called komi, which gives white a 5.5-point compensation under Japanese rules, 6.5-point under Korean rules, and 15/4 stones, or 7.5-point under Chinese rules (number of points varies by rule set). Under handicap play, White receives only a 0.5-point komi, to break a possible tie (&quot;jigo&quot;).

=== Scoring rules ===
Two general types of scoring procedures are used, and players determine which to use before play. Both procedures almost always give the same winner.

* Area scoring procedure (including Chinese): counts the number of points a player&#x27;s stones occupy and surround. It is associated with contemporary Chinese play and was probably established there during the Ming dynasty in the 15th or 16th century. Beginner-friendly, but takes longer to count. A player&#x27;s score is the number of stones that the player has on the board, plus the number of empty intersections surrounded by that player&#x27;s stones. If there is disagreement about which stones are dead, then under area scoring rules, the players simply resume play to resolve the matter. The score is computed using the position after the next time the players pass consecutively.
* Territory scoring procedure (including Japanese and Korean): counts the number of empty points a player&#x27;s stones surround, together with the number of stones the player captured. In the course of the game, each player retains the stones they capture, termed &quot;prisoners&quot;. Any dead stones removed at the end of the game become prisoners. The score is the number of empty points enclosed by a player&#x27;s stones, plus the number of prisoners captured by that player. Under territory scoring there can be an extra penalty for playing inside ones&#x27; territory, so if there is a disagreement extra play to resolve it would, in tournament settings, happen on a separate board, where the player claiming a group is dead would play first, and would demonstrate how to capture those stones. For further information, see Rules of Go.

Both procedures are counted after both players have passed consecutively, the stones that are still on the board but unable to avoid capture, called &quot;dead&quot; stones, are removed. Given that the number of stones a player has on the board is directly related to the number of prisoners their opponent has taken, the resulting net score, that is, the difference between Black&#x27;s and White&#x27;s scores is identical under both rulesets (unless the players have passed different numbers of times during the course of the game). Thus, the net result given by the two scoring systems rarely differs by more than a point.

=== Life and death ===

While not actually mentioned in the rules of Go (at least in simpler rule sets, such as those of New Zealand and the U.S.), the concept of a &quot;living&quot; group of stones is necessary for a practical understanding of the game.


Examples of eyes (marked). The black groups at the top of the board are alive, as they have at least two eyes. The black groups at the bottom are dead as they only have one eye. The point marked &quot;a&quot; is a false eye, thus the black group with false eye &quot;a&quot; can be killed by white in two turns.


When a group of stones is mostly surrounded and has no options to connect with friendly stones elsewhere, the status of the group is either alive, dead or &quot;unsettled&quot;. A group of stones is said to be alive if it cannot be captured, even if the opponent is allowed to move first. Conversely, a group of stones is said to be dead if it cannot avoid capture, even if the owner of the group is allowed the first move. Otherwise, the group is said to be unsettled: the defending player can make it alive or the opponent can &quot;kill&quot; it, depending on who gets to play first.

An eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by a group of stones. If the eye is surrounded by Black stones, White cannot play there unless such a play would take Black&#x27;s last liberty and capture the Black stones. (Such a move is forbidden according to the suicide rule in most rule sets, but even if not forbidden, such a move would be a useless suicide of a White stone.)

If a Black group has two eyes, White can never capture it because White cannot remove both liberties simultaneously. If Black has only one eye, White can capture the Black group by playing in the single eye, removing Black&#x27;s last liberty. Such a move is not suicide because the Black stones are removed first. In the &quot;Examples of eyes&quot; diagram, all the circled points are eyes. The two black groups in the upper corners are alive, as both have at least two eyes. The groups in the lower corners are dead, as both have only one eye. The group in the lower left may seem to have two eyes, but the surrounded empty point marked &quot;a&quot; is not actually an eye. White can play there and take a black stone. Such a point is often called a &quot;false eye&quot;.

=== Seki (mutual life) ===

There is an exception to the requirement that a group must have two eyes to be alive, a situation called &quot;seki&quot; (or &quot;mutual life&quot;). Where different colored groups are adjacent and share liberties, the situation may reach a position when neither player wants to move first because doing so would allow the opponent to capture; in such situations therefore both players&#x27; stones remain on the board (in seki). Neither player receives any points for those groups, but at least those groups themselves remain living, as opposed to being captured.

Seki can occur in many ways. The simplest are:
# each player has a group without eyes and they share two liberties, and
# each player has a group with one eye and they share one more liberty.
In the &quot;Example of seki (mutual life)&quot; diagram, the two circled points are liberties shared by both a black and a white group. Both of these interior groups are at risk, and neither player wants to play on a circled point, because doing so would allow the opponent to capture their group on the next move. The outer groups in this example, both black and white, are alive. Seki can result from an attempt by one player to invade and kill a nearly settled group of the other player.

== Tactics ==
&quot;Tactics&quot; deal with immediate fighting between stones, capturing and saving stones, life, death and other issues localized to a specific part of the board. Larger issues which encompass the territory of the entire board and planning stone-group connections are referred to as &quot;Strategy&quot; and are covered in the &quot;Strategy&quot; section above.

=== Capturing tactics ===
There are several tactical constructs aimed at capturing stones. These are among the first things a player learns after understanding the rules. Recognizing the possibility that stones can be captured using these techniques is an important step forward.

A ladder. Black cannot escape unless the ladder connects to black stones further down the board that will intercept with the ladder or if one of white&#x27;s pieces has only one liberty.


The most basic technique is the &quot;ladder&quot;. This is also sometimes called a &quot;running attack&quot;, since it unfolds as one player trying to outrun the other&#x27;s attack. To capture stones in a ladder, a player uses a constant series of capture threats (atari), giving the opponent only one place to place his stone to keep his group alive. This forces the opponent to move into a zigzag pattern (surrounding the ladder on the outside) as shown in the adjacent diagram to keep the attack coming. Unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way, the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture. However, if the ladder can run into other black stones, thus saving them, then experienced players recognize the futility of continuing the attack. These stones can also be saved if a suitably strong threat can be forced elsewhere on the board, so that two Black stones can be placed here to save the group.


A net. The chain of three marked Black stones cannot escape in any direction, since each Black stone attempting to extend the chain outward (on the red circles) can be easily blocked by one White stone.

Another technique to capture stones is the so-called &quot;net&quot;, also known by its Japanese name, &quot;geta&quot;. This refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones, preventing their escape in all directions. An example is given in the adjacent diagram. It is often better to capture stones in a net than in a ladder, because a net does not depend on the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way, nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker. However, the ladder only requires one turn to kill all the opponent&#x27;s stones, whereas a net requires more turns to do the same.


A snapback. Although Black can capture the white stone by playing at the circled point, the resulting shape for Black has only one liberty (at 1), thus White can then capture the three black stones by playing at 1 again (&quot;snapback&quot;).

A third technique to capture stones is the &quot;snapback&quot;. In a snapback, one player allows a single stone to be captured, then immediately plays on the point formerly occupied by that stone; by so doing, the player captures a larger group of their opponent&#x27;s stones, in effect &quot;snapping back&quot; at those stones. An example can be seen on the right. As with the ladder, an experienced player does not play out such a sequence, recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately.

=== Reading ahead ===
One of the most important skills required for strong tactical play is the ability to read ahead. Reading ahead includes considering available moves to play, the possible responses to each move, and the subsequent possibilities after each of those responses. Some of the strongest players of the game can read up to 40 moves ahead even in complicated positions.

As explained in the scoring rules, some stone formations can never be captured and are said to be alive, while other stones may be in a position where they cannot avoid being captured and are said to be dead. Much of the practice material available to players of the game comes in the form of life and death problems, also known as tsumego. In such problems, players are challenged to find the vital move sequence that kills a group of the opponent or saves a group of their own. Tsumego are considered an excellent way to train a player&#x27;s ability at reading ahead, and are available for all skill levels, some posing a challenge even to top players.

=== Ko fighting ===
In situations when the Ko rule applies, a ko fight may occur. If the player who is prohibited from capture is of the opinion that the capture is important because it prevents a large group of stones from being captured for instance, the player may play a &quot;ko threat&quot;. This is a move elsewhere on the board that threatens to make a large profit if the opponent does not respond. If the opponent does respond to the ko threat, the situation on the board has changed, and the prohibition on capturing the ko no longer applies. Thus the player who made the ko threat may now recapture the ko. Their opponent is then in the same situation and can either play a ko threat as well or concede the ko by simply playing elsewhere. If a player concedes the ko, either because they do not think it important or because there are no moves left that could function as a ko threat, they have &quot;lost&quot; the ko, and their opponent may connect the ko.

Instead of responding to a ko threat, a player may also choose to &quot;ignore&quot; the threat and connect the ko. They thereby win the ko, but at a cost. The choice of when to respond to a threat and when to ignore it is a subtle one, which requires a player to consider many factors, including how much is gained by connecting, how much is lost by not responding, how many possible ko threats both players have remaining, what the optimal order of playing them is, and what the &quot;size&quot;—points lost or gained—of each of the remaining threats is.

Frequently, the winner of the ko fight does not connect the ko but instead captures one of the chains that constituted their opponent&#x27;s side of the ko. In some cases, this leads to another ko fight at a neighboring location.

== History ==
=== Origin in China ===
The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; ( BCE), referring to a historical event of 548 BCE. It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot; and in two books written by Mencius ( BCE). In all of these works, the game is referred to as (). Today, in China, it is known as weiqi (), .

Go was originally played on a 17×17 line grid, but a 19×19 grid became standard by the time of the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Legends trace the origin of the game to the mythical Chinese emperor Yao (2337–2258 BCE), who was said to have had his counselor Shun design it for his unruly son, Danzhu, to favorably influence him. Other theories suggest that the game was derived from Chinese tribal warlords and generals, who used pieces of stone to map out attacking positions.

In China, Go had an important status among elites and was associated with ideas of self-cultivation, wisdom, and gentlemanly ideals. It was considered one of the four cultivated arts of the Chinese scholar gentleman, along with calligraphy, painting and playing the musical instrument guqin. In ancient times the rules of Go were passed on verbally, rather than being written down.

=== Spread to Korea and Japan ===
Go was introduced to Korea sometime between the 5th and 7th centuries CE, and was popular among the higher classes. In Korea, the game is called baduk (), and a variant of the game called Sunjang baduk was developed by the 16th century. Sunjang baduk became the main variant played in Korea until the end of the 19th century, when the current version was reintroduced from Japan.

The game reached Japan in the 7th century CE—where it is called or . It became popular at the Japanese imperial court in the 8th century, and among the general public by the 13th century. The game was further formalized in the 15th century. In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu re-established Japan&#x27;s unified national government. In the same year, he assigned the then-best player in Japan, a Buddhist monk named Nikkai (né Kanō Yosaburo, 1559), to the post of Godokoro (Minister of Go).

Nikkai took the name Hon&#x27;inbō Sansa and founded the Hon&#x27;inbō Go school. Several competing schools were founded soon after. These officially recognized and subsidized Go schools greatly developed the level of play and introduced the dan/kyu style system of ranking players. Players from the four schools (Hon&#x27;inbō, Yasui, Inoue and Hayashi) competed in the annual castle games, played in the presence of the shōgun.

=== Internationalization ===
Despite its widespread popularity in East Asia, Go has been slow to spread to the rest of the world. Although there are some mentions of the game in western literature from the 16th century forward, Go did not start to become popular in the West until the end of the 19th century, when German scientist Oskar Korschelt wrote a treatise on the game. By the early 20th century, Go had spread throughout the German and Austro-Hungarian empires. In 1905, Edward Lasker learned the game while in Berlin. When he moved to New York, Lasker founded the New York Go Club together with (amongst others) Arthur Smith, who had learned of the game in Japan while touring the East and had published the book &quot;The Game of Go&quot; in 1908. Lasker&#x27;s book &quot;Go and Go-moku&quot; (1934) helped spread the game throughout the U.S., and in 1935, the American Go Association was formed. Two years later, in 1937, the German Go Association was founded.

World War II put a stop to most Go activity, since it was a popular game in Japan, but after the war, Go continued to spread. For most of the 20th century, the Japan Go Association (Nihon Ki-in) played a leading role in spreading Go outside East Asia by publishing the English-language magazine &quot;Go Review&quot; in the 1960s, establishing Go centers in the U.S., Europe and South America, and often sending professional teachers on tour to Western nations. Internationally, the game had been commonly known since the start of the twentieth century by its shortened Japanese name, and terms for common Go concepts are derived from their Japanese pronunciation.

In 1996, NASA astronaut Daniel Barry and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata became the first people to play Go in space. They used a special Go set, which was named Go Space, designed by Wai-Cheung Willson Chow. Both astronauts were awarded honorary dan ranks by the Nihon Ki-in.

, the International Go Federation has 75 member countries, with 67 member countries outside East Asia. Chinese cultural centres across the world are promoting Go, and cooperating with local Go associations, for example the seminars held by the Chinese cultural centre in Tel Aviv, Israel, together with the Israeli Go association.

== Competitive play ==

=== Ranks and ratings ===

In Go, rank indicates a player&#x27;s skill in the game. Traditionally, ranks are measured using &quot;kyu&quot; and &quot;dan&quot; grades, a system also adopted by many martial arts. More recently, mathematical rating systems similar to the Elo rating system have been introduced. Such rating systems often provide a mechanism for converting a rating to a kyu or dan grade. Kyu grades (abbreviated &quot;k&quot;) are considered student grades and decrease as playing level increases, meaning 1st kyu is the strongest available kyu grade. Dan grades (abbreviated &quot;d&quot;) are considered master grades, and increase from 1st dan to 7th dan. First dan equals a black belt in eastern martial arts using this system. The difference among each amateur rank is one handicap stone. For example, if a 5k plays a game with a 1k, the 5k would need a handicap of four stones to even the odds. Top-level amateur players sometimes defeat professionals in tournament play. Professional players have professional dan ranks (abbreviated &quot;p&quot;). These ranks are separate from amateur ranks.

The rank system comprises, from the lowest to highest ranks:
=== Tournament and match rules ===

Tournament and match rules deal with factors that may influence the game but are not part of the actual rules of play. Such rules may differ between events. Rules that influence the game include: the setting of compensation points (komi), handicap, and time control parameters. Rules that do not generally influence the game are the tournament system, pairing strategies, and placement criteria.

Common tournament systems used in Go include the McMahon system, Swiss system, league systems and the knockout system. Tournaments may combine multiple systems; many professional Go tournaments use a combination of the league and knockout systems.

Tournament rules may also set the following:
* compensation points, called komi, which compensate the second player for the first move advantage of their opponent; tournaments commonly use a compensation in the range of 5–8 points, generally including a half-point to prevent draws;
* handicap stones placed on the board before alternate play, allowing players of different strengths to play competitively (see Go handicap for more information); and
* &quot;superko&quot;: Although the basic ko rule described above covers more than 95% of all cycles occurring in games, there are some complex situations—triple ko, &quot;eternal life&quot;, etc.—that are not covered by it but would allow the game to cycle indefinitely. To prevent this, the ko rule is sometimes extended to forbid the repetition of &quot;any&quot; previous position. This extension is called superko.

=== Time control ===
A game of Go may be timed using a game clock. Formal time controls were introduced into the professional game during the 1920s and were controversial. Adjournments and sealed moves began to be regulated in the 1930s. Go tournaments use a number of different time control systems. All common systems envisage a single main period of time for each player for the game, but they vary on the protocols for continuation (in &quot;overtime&quot;) after a player has finished that time allowance. The most widely used time control system is the so-called byoyomi system. The top professional Go matches have timekeepers so that the players do not have to press their own clocks.

Two widely used variants of the byoyomi system are:
* &quot;Standard byoyomi&quot;: After the main time is depleted, a player has a certain number of time periods (typically around thirty seconds). After each move, the number of full-time periods that the player took (often zero) is subtracted. For example, if a player has three thirty-second time periods and takes thirty or more (but less than sixty) seconds to make a move, they lose one time period. With 60–89 seconds, they lose two time periods, and so on. If, however, they take less than thirty seconds, the timer simply resets without subtracting any periods. Using up the last period means that the player has lost on time.
* &quot;Canadian byoyomi&quot;: After using all of their main time, a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time, such as twenty moves within five minutes. If the time period expires without the required number of stones having been played, then the player has lost on time.

=== Notation and recording games ===

Go games are recorded with a simple coordinate system. This is comparable to algebraic chess notation, except that Go stones do not move and thus require only one coordinate per turn. Coordinate systems include purely numerical (4–4 point), hybrid (K3), and purely alphabetical. The Smart Game Format uses alphabetical coordinates internally, but most editors represent the board with hybrid coordinates as this reduces confusion.

Alternatively, the game record can also be noted by writing the successive moves on a diagram, where odd numbers mean black stones, even numbers mean white stones (or conversely when playing with a handicap), and a notation like &quot;25=22&quot; in the margin means that the 25th stone was played at the same location as the 22nd one, which had been captured in the meantime.

The Japanese word kifu is sometimes used to refer to a game record.

In Unicode, Go stones can be represented with black and white circles from the block Geometric Shapes:
* 

The block Miscellaneous Symbols includes &quot;Go markers&quot; that were likely meant for mathematical research of Go:

=== Top players and professional Go ===
A Go professional is a professional player of the game of Go. There are six areas with professional go associations, these are: China (Chinese Weiqi Association), Japan (Nihon Ki-in, Kansai Ki-in), South Korea (Korea Baduk Association), Taiwan (Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation), the United States (AGA Professional System) and Europe (European Professional System).

Although the game was developed in China, the establishment of the Four Go houses by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the start of the 17th century shifted the focus of the Go world to Japan. State sponsorship, allowing players to dedicate themselves full-time to study of the game, and fierce competition between individual houses resulted in a significant increase in the level of play. During this period, the best player of his generation was given the prestigious title Meijin (master) and the post of Godokoro (minister of Go). Of special note are the players who were dubbed Kisei (Go Sage). The only three players to receive this honor were Dōsaku, Jōwa and Shūsaku, all of the house Hon&#x27;inbō.

After the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Restoration period, the Go houses slowly disappeared, and in 1924, the Nihon Ki-in (Japanese Go Association) was formed. Top players from this period often played newspaper-sponsored matches of 2–10 games. Of special note are the (Chinese-born) player Go Seigen (Chinese: Wu Qingyuan), who scored 80% in these matches and beat down most of his opponents to inferior handicaps, and Minoru Kitani, who dominated matches in the early 1930s. These two players are also recognized for their groundbreaking work on new opening theory (Shinfuseki).

For much of the 20th century, Go continued to be dominated by players trained in Japan. Notable names included Eio Sakata, Rin Kaiho (born in Taiwan), Masao Kato, Koichi Kobayashi and Cho Chikun (born Cho Ch&#x27;i-hun, from South Korea). Top Chinese and Korean talents often moved to Japan, because the level of play there was high and funding was more lavish. One of the first Korean players to do so was Cho Namchul, who studied in the Kitani Dojo 1937–1944. After his return to Korea, the Hanguk Kiwon (Korea Baduk Association) was formed and caused the level of play in South Korea to rise significantly in the second half of the 20th century. In China, the game declined during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) but quickly recovered in the last quarter of the 20th century, bringing Chinese players, such as Nie Weiping and Ma Xiaochun, on par with their Japanese and South Korean counterparts. The Chinese Weiqi Association (today part of the China Qiyuan) was established in 1962, and professional dan grades started being issued in 1982. Western professional Go began in 2012 with the American Go Association&#x27;s Professional System. In 2014, the European Go Federation followed suit and started their professional system. 

With the advent of major international titles from 1989 onward, it became possible to compare the level of players from different countries more accurately. Cho Hunhyun of South Korea won the first edition of the Quadrennial Ing Cup in 1989. His disciple Lee Chang-ho was the dominant player in international Go competitions for more than a decade spanning much of 1990s and early 2000s; he is also credited with groundbreaking works on the endgame. Cho, Lee and other South Korean players such as Seo Bong-soo, Yoo Changhyuk and Lee Sedol between them won the majority of international titles in this period. Several Chinese players also rose to the top in international Go from 2000s, most notably Ma Xiaochun, Chang Hao, Gu Li and Ke Jie. , Japan lags behind in the international Go scene.

Historically, more men than women have played Go. Special tournaments for women exist, but until recently, men and women did not compete together at the highest levels; however, the creation of new, open tournaments and the rise of strong female players, most notably Rui Naiwei, have in recent years highlighted the strength and competitiveness of emerging female players.

The level in other countries has traditionally been much lower, except for some players who had preparatory professional training in East Asia. Knowledge of the game has been scant elsewhere up until the 20th century. A famous player of the 1920s was Edward Lasker. It was not until the 1950s that more than a few Western players took up the game as other than a passing interest. In 1978, Manfred Wimmer became the first Westerner to receive a professional player&#x27;s certificate from an East Asian professional Go association. In 2000, American Michael Redmond became the first Western player to achieve a 9 dan rank.

== Equipment ==

It is possible to play Go with a simple paper board and coins, plastic tokens, or white beans and coffee beans for the stones; or even by drawing the stones on the board and erasing them when captured. More popular midrange equipment includes cardstock, a laminated particle board, or wood boards with stones of plastic or glass. More expensive traditional materials are still used by many players. The most expensive Go sets have black stones carved from slate and white stones carved from translucent white shells (traditionally &quot;Meretrix lamarckii&quot;), played on boards carved in a single piece from the trunk of a tree.

=== Traditional equipment ===
==== Boards ====
The Go board (generally referred to by its Japanese name &quot;goban&quot; ) typically measures between in length (from one player&#x27;s side to the other) and in width. Chinese boards are slightly larger, as a traditional Chinese Go stone is slightly larger to match. The board is not square; there is a 15:14 ratio in length to width, because with a perfectly square board, from the player&#x27;s viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board. The added length compensates for this. There are two main types of boards: a table board similar in most respects to other gameboards like that used for chess, and a floor board, which is its own free-standing table and at which the players sit.

The traditional Japanese &quot;goban&quot; is between thick and has legs; it sits on the floor (see picture). It is preferably made from the rare golden-tinged Kaya tree (&quot;Torreya nucifera&quot;), with the very best made from Kaya trees up to 700 years old. More recently, the related California Torreya (&quot;Torreya californica&quot;) has been prized for its light color and pale rings as well as its reduced expense and more readily available stock. The natural resources of Japan have been unable to keep up with the enormous demand for the slow-growing Kaya trees; both &quot;T. nucifera&quot; and &quot;T. californica&quot; take many hundreds of years to grow to the necessary size, and they are now extremely rare, raising the price of such equipment tremendously. As Kaya trees are a protected species in Japan, they cannot be harvested until they have died. Thus, an old-growth, floor-standing Kaya &quot;goban&quot; can easily cost in excess of $10,000 with the highest-quality examples costing more than $60,000.

Other, less expensive woods often used to make quality table boards in both Chinese and Japanese dimensions include Hiba (&quot;Thujopsis dolabrata&quot;), Katsura (&quot;Cercidiphyllum japonicum&quot;), Kauri (&quot;Agathis&quot;), and Shin Kaya (various varieties of spruce, commonly from Alaska, Siberia and China&#x27;s Yunnan Province). So-called &quot;Shin Kaya&quot; is a potentially confusing merchant&#x27;s term: &quot;shin&quot; means &#x27;new&#x27;, and thus &quot;shin kaya&quot; is best translated &#x27;faux kaya&#x27;, because the woods so described are biologically unrelated to Kaya.

==== Stones ====
A full set of Go stones (&quot;goishi&quot;) usually contains 181 black stones and 180 white ones; a 19×19 grid has 361 points, so there are enough stones to cover the board, and Black gets the extra odd stone because that player goes first. However it may happen, especially in beginners&#x27; games, that many back-and-forth captures empty the bowls before the end of the game: in that case an exchange of prisoners allows the game to continue.

Traditional Japanese stones are double-convex, and made of clamshell (white) and slate (black). The classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in Wakayama Prefecture and the clamshell from the Hamaguri clam (&quot;Meretrix lusoria&quot;) or the Korean hard clam; however, due to a scarcity in the Japanese supply of these clams, the stones are most often made of shells harvested from Mexico. Historically, the most prized stones were made of jade, often given to the reigning emperor as a gift.

In China, the game is traditionally played with single-convex stones made of a composite called Yunzi. The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by sintering a proprietary and trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds derived from the local stone. This process dates to the Tang dynasty and, after the knowledge was lost in the 1920s during the Chinese Civil War, was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now state-run Yunzi company. The material is praised for its colors, its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as melamine, and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate/shell. The term &quot;yunzi&quot; can also refer to a single-convex stone made of any material; however, most English-language Go suppliers specify Yunzi as a material and single-convex as a shape to avoid confusion, as stones made of Yunzi are also available in double-convex while synthetic stones can be either shape.

Traditional stones are made so that black stones are slightly larger in diameter than white; this is to compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equal-sized white stones appear larger on the board than black stones.

==== Bowls ====
The bowls for the stones are shaped like a flattened sphere with a level underside. The lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game. Chinese bowls are slightly larger, and a little more rounded, a style known generally as &quot;Go Seigen&quot;; Japanese &quot;Kitani&quot; bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a snifter glass, such as for brandy. The bowls are usually made of turned wood. Mulberry is the traditional material for Japanese bowls, but is very expensive; wood from the Chinese jujube date tree, which has a lighter color (it is often stained) and slightly more visible grain pattern, is a common substitute for rosewood, and traditional for Go Seigen-style bowls. Other traditional materials used for making Chinese bowls include lacquered wood, ceramics, stone and woven straw or rattan. The names of the bowl shapes, &quot;Go Seigen&quot; and &quot;Kitani&quot;, were introduced in the last quarter of the 20th century by the professional player Janice Kim as homage to two 20th-century professional Go players by the same names, of Chinese and Japanese nationality, respectively, who are referred to as the &quot;Fathers of modern Go&quot;.

=== Playing technique and etiquette ===
The traditional way to place a Go stone is to first take one from the bowl, gripping it between the index and middle fingers, with the middle finger on top, and then placing it directly on the desired intersection. One can also place a stone on the board and then slide it into position under appropriate circumstances (where it does not move any other stones). It is considered respectful towards White for Black to place the first stone of the game in the upper right-hand corner. (Because of symmetry, this has no effect on the game&#x27;s outcome.)

It is considered poor manners to run one&#x27;s fingers through one&#x27;s bowl of unplayed stones, as the sound, however soothing to the player doing this, can be disturbing to one&#x27;s opponent. Similarly, clacking a stone against another stone, the board, or the table or floor is also discouraged. However, it is permissible to emphasize select moves by striking the board more firmly than normal, thus producing a sharp clack. Additionally, hovering one&#x27;s arm over the board (usually when deciding where to play) is also considered rude as it obstructs the opponent&#x27;s view of the board.

Manners and etiquette are extensively discussed in &#x27;The Classic of WeiQi in Thirteen Chapters&#x27;, a Song dynasty manual to the game. Apart from the points above it also points to the need to remain calm and honorable, in maintaining posture, and knowing the key specialised terms, such as titles of common formations. Generally speaking, much attention is paid to the etiquette of playing, as much as to winning or actual game technique.

== Computers and Go ==
=== Software players ===

Go long posed a daunting challenge to computer programmers, putting forward &quot;difficult decision-making tasks, an intractable search space, and an optimal solution so complex it appears infeasible to directly approximate using a policy or value function&quot;. Prior to 2015, the best Go programs only managed to reach amateur dan level. On smaller 9×9 and 13x13 boards, computer programs fared better, and were able to compare to professional players. Many in the field of artificial intelligence consider Go to require more elements that mimic human thought than chess.
The reasons why computer programs had not played Go at the professional dan level prior to 2016 include:
* The number of spaces on the board is much larger (over five times the number of spaces on a chess board—361 vs. 64). On most turns there are many more possible moves in Go than in chess. Throughout most of the game, the number of legal moves stays at around 150–250 per turn, and rarely falls below 100 (in chess, the average number of moves is 37). Because an exhaustive computer program for Go must calculate and compare every possible legal move in each ply (player turn), its ability to calculate the best plays is sharply reduced when there are a large number of possible moves. Most computer game algorithms, such as those for chess, compute several moves in advance. Given an average of 200 available moves through most of the game, for a computer to calculate its next move by exhaustively anticipating the next four moves of each possible play (two of its own and two of its opponent&#x27;s), it would have to consider more than 320 billion (3.2) possible combinations. To exhaustively calculate the next eight moves, would require computing 512 quintillion (5.12) possible combinations. , the most powerful supercomputer in the world, NUDT&#x27;s &quot;Tianhe-2&quot;, can sustain 33.86 petaflops. At this rate, even given an exceedingly low estimate of 10 operations required to assess the value of one play of a stone, Tianhe-2 would require four hours to assess all possible combinations of the next eight moves in order to make a single play.
* The placement of a single stone in the initial phase can affect the play of the game a hundred or more moves later. A computer would have to predict this influence, and it would be unworkable to attempt to exhaustively analyze the next hundred moves.
* In capture-based games (such as chess), a position can often be evaluated relatively easily, such as by calculating who has a material advantage or more active pieces. In Go, there is often no easy way to evaluate a position. However a 6-kyu human can evaluate a position at a glance, to see which player has more territory, and even beginners can estimate the score within 10 points, given time to count it. The number of stones on the board (material advantage) is only a weak indicator of the strength of a position, and a territorial advantage (more empty points surrounded) for one player might be compensated by the opponent&#x27;s strong positions and influence all over the board. Normally a 3-dan can easily judge most of these positions.

It was not until August 2008 that a computer won a game against a professional level player at a handicap of 9 stones, the greatest handicap normally given to a weaker opponent. It was the Mogo program, which scored this first victory in an exhibition game played during the US Go Congress. By 2013, a win at the professional level of play was accomplished with a four-stone advantage. In October 2015, Google DeepMind&#x27;s program AlphaGo beat Fan Hui, the European Go champion and a 2 dan (out of 9 dan possible) professional, five times out of five with no handicap on a full size 19×19 board. AlphaGo used a fundamentally different paradigm than earlier Go programs; it included very little direct instruction, and mostly used deep learning where AlphaGo played itself in hundreds of millions of games such that it could measure positions more intuitively. In March 2016, Google next challenged Lee Sedol, a 9 dan considered the top player in the world in the early 21st century, to a five-game match. Leading up to the game, Lee Sedol and other top professionals were confident that he would win; however, AlphaGo defeated Lee in four of the five games. After having already lost the series by the third game, Lee won the fourth game, describing his win as &quot;invaluable&quot;. In May 2017, AlphaGo beat Ke Jie, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years, winning each game in a three-game match during the Future of Go Summit. In October 2017, DeepMind announced a significantly stronger version called AlphaGo Zero which beat the previous version by 100 games to 0.

In February 2023, Kellin Pelrine, an amateur American Go player, won 14 out of 15 games against a top-ranked AI system in a significant victory over artificial intelligence. Pelrine took advantage of a previously unknown flaw in the Go computer program, which had been identified by another computer. He exploited this weakness by slowly encircling the opponent&#x27;s stones and distracting the AI with moves in other parts of the board. The tactics used by Pelrine have highlighted a fundamental flaw in the deep learning systems that underpin many of today&#x27;s advanced AI. Although the AI systems can &quot;understand&quot; specific situations, they lack the ability to generalize in a way that humans find easy.

=== Software assistance ===


An abundance of software is available to support players of the game. This includes programs that can be used to view or edit game records and diagrams, programs that allow the user to search for patterns in the games of strong players, and programs that allow users to play against each other over the Internet.

Some web servers provide graphical aids like maps, to aid learning during play. These graphical aids may suggest possible next moves, indicate areas of influence, highlight vital stones under attack and mark stones in atari or about to be captured.

There are several file formats used to store game records, the most popular of which is SGF, short for Smart Game Format. Programs used for editing game records allow the user to record not only the moves, but also variations, commentary and further information on the game.

Electronic databases can be used to study life and death situations, joseki, fuseki and games by a particular player. Programs are available that give players pattern searching options, which allow players to research positions by searching for high-level games in which similar situations occur. Such software generally lists common follow-up moves that have been played by professionals and gives statistics on win–loss ratio in opening situations.

Internet-based Go servers allow access to competition with players all over the world, for real-time and turn-based games. Such servers also allow easy access to professional teaching, with both teaching games and interactive game review being possible.

== In popular culture ==

Apart from technical literature and study material, Go and its strategies have been the subject of several works of fiction, such as &quot;The Master of Go&quot; by Nobel Prize in Literature-winning author Yasunari Kawabata and &quot;The Girl Who Played Go&quot; (2001) by Shan Sa. Other books have used Go as a theme or minor plot device. For example, the 1979 novel &quot;Shibumi&quot; by Trevanian centers around the game and uses Go metaphors. Go features prominently in the &quot;Chung Kuo&quot; series of novels by David Wingrove, being the favourite game of the main villain.

The manga series &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; and its anime adaptation, first released in Japan in 1998 and 2001 respectively, had a large impact in popularizing Go among young players, both in Japan and—as translations were released—abroad.

Similarly, Go has been used as a subject or plot device in film, such as &quot;Pi (π)&quot;, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Knives Out&quot;, and &quot;The Go Master&quot; (a biopic of Go professional Go Seigen). 2013&#x27;s &quot;Tôkyô ni kita bakari&quot; or &quot;Tokyo Newcomer&quot; portrays a Chinese foreigner Go player moving to Tokyo. In King Hu&#x27;s wuxia film &quot;The Valiant Ones&quot;, the characters are color-coded as Go stones (black or other dark shades for the Chinese, white for the Japanese invaders), Go boards and stones are used by the characters to keep track of soldiers prior to battle, and the battles themselves are structured like a game of Go.

Go has also been featured as a plot device in a number of television series. Examples include Starz&#x27;s science fiction thriller &quot;Counterpart&quot;, which is rich in references (the opening itself featuring developments on a Go board), and includes Go matches, accurately played, relevant to the plot. Also, in 2024 Netflix released the historical-fictional Korean series &quot;Captivating the King&quot;.

The corporation and brand Atari was named after the Go term, Atari.

Hedge fund manager Mark Spitznagel used Go as his main investing metaphor in his investing book &quot;The Dao of Capital&quot;. &quot;The Way of Go: 8 Ancient Strategy Secrets for Success in Business and Life&quot; by Troy Anderson applies Go strategy to business. &quot;GO: An Asian Paradigm for Business Strategy&quot; by Miura Yasuyuki, a manager with Japan Airlines, uses Go to describe the thinking and behavior of business men.

== Psychological perspectives ==
A 2004 review of literature by Fernand Gobet, de Voogt and Jean Retschitzki showed that relatively little scientific research had been carried out on the psychology of Go, compared with other traditional board games such as chess. Computer Go research has shown that given the large search tree, knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in Go than in other strategy games, such as chess. A study of the effects of age on Go-playing has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players. According to the review of Gobet and colleagues, the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as PET and fMRI does not show large differences between Go and chess. On the other hand, a study by Xiangchuan Chen et al. showed greater activation in the right hemisphere among Go players than among chess players, but the research was inconclusive because strong players from Go were hired while very weak chess players were hired in the original study. There is some evidence to suggest a correlation between playing board games and reduced risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia.

Arthur Mary, a French researcher in clinical psychopathology, reports on his psychotherapeutic approaches using the game of Go with patients in private practice and in a psychiatric ward. Drawing on neuroscience research and employing a psychoanalytic (Lacanian) and phenomenological approach, he demonstrates how drives are expressed on the goban. He offers some suggestions to therapists for defining ways of playing go that lead to therapeutic effects.

== Analyses of the game ==

In formal game theory terms, Go is a non-chance, combinatorial game with perfect information. Informally that means there are no dice used (and decisions or moves create discrete outcome vectors rather than probability distributions), the underlying math is combinatorial, and all moves (via single vertex analysis) are visible to both players (unlike some card games where some information is hidden). Perfect information also implies sequence—players can theoretically know about all past moves.

Other game theoretical taxonomy elements include the facts
*Go is bounded by a finite number of moves and every game must end with a victor or a tie (although ties are very rare); 
*the strategy is associative because every strategy is a function of board position; 
*the format is non-cooperative (that is, it&#x27;s not a team sport); 
*positions are extensible, and so can be represented by board position trees; 
*the game is zero-sum because player choices do not increase resources available, the rewards in the game are fixed and if one player wins, the other loses, and the utility function is restricted (in the sense of win/lose);
*however, ratings, monetary rewards, national and personal pride and other factors can extend utility functions, but generally not to the extent of removing the win/lose restriction, although Affine transformations can theoretically add non-zero and complex utility aspects even to two player games.

In the endgame, it can often happen that the state of the board consists of several subpositions that do not interact with the others. The whole board position can then be considered as a mathematical sum, or composition, of the individual subpositions. It is this property of Go endgames that led John Horton Conway to the discovery of surreal numbers.

In combinatorial game theory terms, Go is a zero-sum, perfect-information, partisan, deterministic strategy game, putting it in the same class as chess, draughts (checkers), and Reversi (Othello).

The game emphasizes the importance of balance on multiple levels: to secure an area of the board, it is good to play moves close together; however, to cover the largest area, one needs to spread out, perhaps leaving weaknesses that can be exploited. Playing too &quot;low&quot; (close to the edge) secures insufficient territory and influence, yet playing too &quot;high&quot; (far from the edge) allows the opponent to invade. Decisions in one part of the board may be influenced by an apparently unrelated situation in a distant part of the board (for example, ladders can be broken by stones at an arbitrary distance away). Plays made early in the game can shape the nature of conflict a hundred moves later.

The game complexity of Go is such that describing even elementary strategy fills many introductory books. In fact, numerical estimates show that the number of possible games of Go far exceeds the number of atoms in the observable universe.

Go also contributed to the development of combinatorial game theory (with Go infinitesimals being a specific example of its use in Go).

== Comparisons to other games ==
Go begins with an empty board. It is focused on building from the ground up (nothing to something) with multiple, simultaneous battles leading to a point-based win. Chess is tactical rather than strategic, as the predetermined strategy is to trap one individual piece (the king). This comparison has also been applied to military and political history, with Scott Boorman&#x27;s book &quot;The Protracted Game&quot; (1969) and, more recently, Robert Greene&#x27;s book &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; (1998) exploring the strategy of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War through the lens of Go.

A similar comparison has been drawn among Go, chess and backgammon, perhaps the three oldest games that enjoy worldwide popularity. Backgammon is a &quot;man vs. fate&quot; contest, with chance playing a strong role in determining the outcome. Chess, with rows of soldiers marching forward to capture each other, embodies the conflict of &quot;man vs. man&quot;. Because the handicap system tells Go players where they stand relative to other players, an honestly ranked player can expect to lose about half of their games; therefore, Go can be seen as embodying the quest for self-improvement, &quot;man vs. self&quot;.

<text>Angiogenesis is the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels, formed in the earlier stage of vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis continues the growth of the vasculature mainly by processes of sprouting and splitting, but processes such as coalescent angiogenesis, vessel elongation and vessel cooption also play a role. Vasculogenesis is the embryonic formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors, and from neovascularization, although discussions are not always precise (especially in older texts). The first vessels in the developing embryo form through vasculogenesis, after which angiogenesis is responsible for most, if not all, blood vessel growth during development and in disease.

Angiogenesis is a normal and vital process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. However, it is also a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign state to a malignant one, leading to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. The essential role of angiogenesis in tumor growth was first proposed in 1971 by Judah Folkman, who described tumors as &quot;hot and bloody,&quot; illustrating that, at least for many tumor types, flush perfusion and even hyperemia are characteristic.

==Types==

===Sprouting angiogenesis===
Sprouting angiogenesis was the first identified form of angiogenesis and because of this, it is much more understood than intussusceptive angiogenesis. It occurs in several well-characterized stages. The initial signal comes from tissue areas that are devoid of vasculature. The hypoxia that is noted in these areas causes the tissues to demand the presence of nutrients and oxygen that will allow the tissue to carry out metabolic activities. Because of this, parenchymal cells will secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) which is a proangiogenic growth factor. These biological signals activate receptors on endothelial cells present in pre-existing blood vessels. Second, the activated endothelial cells, also known as tip cells, begin to release enzymes called proteases that degrade the basement membrane to allow endothelial cells to escape from the original (parent) vessel walls. The endothelial cells then proliferate into the surrounding matrix and form solid sprouts connecting neighboring vessels. The cells that are proliferating are located behind the tip cells and are known as stalk cells. The proliferation of these cells allows the capillary sprout to grow in length simultaneously.

As sprouts extend toward the source of the angiogenic stimulus, endothelial cells migrate in tandem, using adhesion molecules called integrins. These sprouts then form loops to become a full-fledged vessel lumen as cells migrate to the site of angiogenesis. Sprouting occurs at a rate of several millimeters per day, and enables new vessels to grow across gaps in the vasculature. It is markedly different from splitting angiogenesis because it forms entirely new vessels as opposed to splitting existing vessels.

===Intussusceptive angiogenesis===

Intussusceptive angiogenesis, also known as &quot;splitting angiogenesis&quot;, is the formation of a new blood vessel by splitting an existing blood vessel into two.

Intussusception was first observed in neonatal rats. In this type of vessel formation, the capillary wall extends into the lumen to split a single vessel in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish a zone of contact. Second, the endothelial cell junctions are reorganized and the vessel bilayer is perforated to allow growth factors and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the 2 new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with pericytes and myofibroblasts. These cells begin laying collagen fibers into the core to provide an extracellular matrix for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception is important because it is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast increase in the number of capillaries without a corresponding increase in the number of endothelial cells. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich microvasculature with new cells every time a new vessel develops.

===Coalescent angiogenesis===

Coalescent angiogenesis is a mode of angiogenesis, considered to be the opposite of intussusceptive angiogenesis, where capillaries fuse, or coalesce, to make a larger bloodvessel, thereby increasing blood flow and circulation. Coalescent angiogenesis has extended out of the domain of embryology. It is assumed to play a role in the formation of neovasculature, such as in a tumor.

==Physiology==

===Mechanical stimulation===
Mechanical stimulation of angiogenesis is not well characterized. There is a significant amount of controversy with regard to shear stress acting on capillaries to cause angiogenesis, although current knowledge suggests that increased muscle contractions may increase angiogenesis. This may be due to an increase in the production of nitric oxide during exercise. Nitric oxide results in vasodilation of blood vessels.

===Chemical stimulation===
Chemical stimulation of angiogenesis is performed by various angiogenic proteins e.g. integrins and prostaglandins, including several growth factors e.g. VEGF, FGF.

====Overview====
====FGF====
The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family with its prototype members FGF-1 (acidic FGF) and FGF-2 (basic FGF) consists to date of at least 22 known members. Most are single-chain peptides of 16-18 kDa and display high affinity to heparin and heparan sulfate. In general, FGFs stimulate a variety of cellular functions by binding to cell surface FGF-receptors in the presence of heparin proteoglycans. The FGF-receptor family is composed of seven members, and all the receptor proteins are single-chain receptor tyrosine kinases that become activated through autophosphorylation induced by a mechanism of FGF-mediated receptor dimerization. Receptor activation gives rise to a signal transduction cascade that leads to gene activation and diverse biological responses, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and matrix dissolution, thus initiating a process of mitogenic activity critical for the growth of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.
FGF-1, unique among all 22 members of the FGF family, can bind to all seven FGF-receptor subtypes, making it the broadest-acting member of the FGF family, and a potent mitogen for the diverse cell types needed to mount an angiogenic response in damaged (hypoxic) tissues, where upregulation of FGF-receptors occurs. FGF-1 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of all cell types necessary for building an arterial vessel, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells; this fact &quot;distinguishes FGF-1 from other pro-angiogenic growth factors&quot;, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which primarily drives the formation of new capillaries.

Besides FGF-1, one of the most important functions of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2 or bFGF) is the promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and the physical organization of endothelial cells into tube-like structures, thus promoting angiogenesis. FGF-2 is a more potent angiogenic factor than VEGF or PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor); however, it is less potent than FGF-1. As well as stimulating blood vessel growth, aFGF (FGF-1) and bFGF (FGF-2) are important players in wound healing. They stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells that give rise to angiogenesis and developing granulation tissue; both increase blood supply and fill up a wound space/cavity early in the wound-healing process.

====VEGF====
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been demonstrated to be a major contributor to angiogenesis, increasing the number of capillaries in a given network. Initial &quot;in vitro&quot; studies demonstrated bovine capillary endothelial cells will proliferate and show signs of tube structures upon stimulation by VEGF and bFGF, although the results were more pronounced with VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the physiological response to exercise and its role in angiogenesis is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis because, in the presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually forming tube structures resembling capillaries.
VEGF causes a massive signaling cascade in endothelial cells. Binding to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) starts a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade that stimulates the production of factors that variously stimulate vessel permeability (eNOS, producing NO), proliferation/survival (bFGF), migration (ICAMs/VCAMs/MMPs) and finally differentiation into mature blood vessels. Mechanically, VEGF is upregulated with muscle contractions as a result of increased blood flow to affected areas. The increased flow also causes a large increase in the mRNA production of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The increase in receptor production means muscle contractions could cause upregulation of the signaling cascade relating to angiogenesis. As part of the angiogenic signaling cascade, NO is widely considered to be a major contributor to the angiogenic response because inhibition of NO significantly reduces the effects of angiogenic growth factors. However, inhibition of NO during exercise does not inhibit angiogenesis, indicating there are other factors involved in the angiogenic response.

====Angiopoietins====
The angiopoietins, Ang1 and Ang2, are required for the formation of mature blood vessels, as demonstrated by mouse knock out studies. Ang1 and Ang2 are protein growth factors which act by binding their receptors, Tie-1 and Tie-2; while this is somewhat controversial, it seems that cell signals are transmitted mostly by Tie-2; though some papers show physiologic signaling via Tie-1 as well. These receptors are tyrosine kinases. Thus, they can initiate cell signaling when ligand binding causes a dimerization that initiates phosphorylation on key tyrosines.

====MMP====
Another major contributor to angiogenesis is matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). MMPs help degrade the proteins that keep the vessel walls solid. This proteolysis allows the endothelial cells to escape into the interstitial matrix as seen in sprouting angiogenesis. Inhibition of MMPs prevents the formation of new capillaries. These enzymes are highly regulated during the vessel formation process because destruction of the extracellular matrix would decrease the integrity of the microvasculature.

====Dll4====
Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) is a protein with a negative regulatory effect on angiogenesis. Dll4 is a transmembrane ligand, for the notch family of receptors. There have been many studies conducted that have served to determine consequences of the Delta-like Ligand 4. One study in particular evaluated the effects of Dll4 on tumor vascularity and growth. In order for a tumor to grow and develop, it must have the proper vasculature. The VEGF pathway is vital to the development of vasculature that in turn, helps the tumors to grow. The combined blockade of VEGF and Dll4 results in the inhibition of tumor progression and angiogenesis throughout the tumor. This is due to the hindrance of signaling in endothelial cell signaling which cuts off the proliferation and sprouting of these endothelial cells. With this inhibition, the cells do not uncontrollably grow, therefore, the cancer is stopped at this point. if the blockade, however, were to be lifted, the cells would begin their proliferation once again.

==== Class 3 semaphorins ====
Class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3s) regulate angiogenesis by modulating endothelial cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival and the recruitment of pericytes. Furthermore, semaphorins can interfere with VEGF-mediated angiogenesis since both SEMA3s and VEGF-A compete for neuropilin receptor binding at endothelial cells. The relative expression levels of SEMA3s and VEGF-A may therefore be important for angiogenesis.

===Chemical inhibition===
An angiogenesis inhibitor can be endogenous or come from outside as drug or a dietary component.

==Application in medicine==

===Angiogenesis as a therapeutic target===
Angiogenesis may be a target for combating diseases such as heart disease characterized by either poor vascularisation or abnormal vasculature. Application of specific compounds that may inhibit or induce the creation of new blood vessels in the body may help combat such diseases. The presence of blood vessels where there should be none may affect the mechanical properties of a tissue, increasing the likelihood of failure. The absence of blood vessels in a repairing or otherwise metabolically active tissue may inhibit repair or other essential functions. Several diseases, such as ischemic chronic wounds, are the result of failure or insufficient blood vessel formation and may be treated by a local expansion of blood vessels, thus bringing new nutrients to the site, facilitating repair. Other diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, may be created by a local expansion of blood vessels, interfering with normal physiological processes.

The modern clinical application of the principle of angiogenesis can be divided into two main areas: anti-angiogenic therapies, which angiogenic research began with, and pro-angiogenic therapies. Whereas anti-angiogenic therapies are being employed to fight cancer and malignancies, which require an abundance of oxygen and nutrients to proliferate, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardiovascular diseases, the number one cause of death in the Western world. One of the first applications of pro-angiogenic methods in humans was a German trial using fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) for the treatment of coronary artery disease.

Regarding the mechanism of action, pro-angiogenic methods can be differentiated into three main categories: gene therapy, targeting genes of interest for amplification or inhibition; protein replacement therapy, which primarily manipulates angiogenic growth factors like FGF-1 or vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF; and cell-based therapies, which involve the implantation of specific cell types.

There are still serious, unsolved problems related to gene therapy. Difficulties include effective integration of the therapeutic genes into the genome of target cells, reducing the risk of an undesired immune response, potential toxicity, immunogenicity, inflammatory responses, and oncogenesis related to the viral vectors used in implanting genes and the sheer complexity of the genetic basis of angiogenesis. The most commonly occurring disorders in humans, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, are most likely caused by the combined effects of variations in many genes, and, thus, injecting a single gene may not be significantly beneficial in such diseases.

By contrast, pro-angiogenic protein therapy uses well-defined, precisely structured proteins, with previously defined optimal doses of the individual protein for disease states, and with well-known biological effects. On the other hand, an obstacle of protein therapy is the mode of delivery. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intramuscular routes of protein administration are not always as effective, as the therapeutic protein may be metabolized or cleared before it can enter the target tissue. Cell-based pro-angiogenic therapies are still early stages of research, with many open questions regarding best cell types and dosages to use.

===Tumor angiogenesis===

Cancer cells are cells that have lost their ability to divide in a controlled fashion. A malignant tumor consists of a population of rapidly dividing and growing cancer cells that progressively accrues mutations. However, tumors need a dedicated blood supply to provide the oxygen and other essential nutrients they require in order to grow beyond a certain size (generally 1–2 mm3).

Tumors induce blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) by secreting various growth factors (e.g. VEGF) and proteins. Growth factors such as bFGF and VEGF can induce capillary growth into the tumor, which some researchers suspect supply required nutrients, allowing for tumor expansion. Unlike normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are dilated with an irregular shape. Other clinicians believe angiogenesis really serves as a waste pathway, taking away the biological end products secreted by rapidly dividing cancer cells. In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be about the size of the metal ball at the end of a ball-point pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or metastasis. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of endothelial cells and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies. The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and oxygen and a waste disposal pathway.

Endothelial cells have long been considered genetically more stable than cancer cells. This genomic stability confers an advantage to targeting endothelial cells using antiangiogenic therapy, compared to chemotherapy directed at cancer cells, which rapidly mutate and acquire drug resistance to treatment. For this reason, endothelial cells are thought to be an ideal target for therapies directed against them.

===Formation of tumor blood vessels===
The mechanism of blood vessel formation by angiogenesis is initiated by the spontaneous dividing of tumor cells due to a mutation. Angiogenic stimulators are then released by the tumor cells. These then travel to already established, nearby blood vessels and activates their endothelial cell receptors. This induces a release of proteolytic enzymes from the vasculature. These enzymes target a particular point on the blood vessel and cause a pore to form. This is the point where the new blood vessel will grow from. The reason tumour cells need a blood supply is because they cannot grow any more than 2-3 millimeters in diameter without an established blood supply which is equivalent to about 50-100 cells. Certain studies have indicated that vessels formed inside the tumor tissue are of higher irregularity and bigger in size, which is as well associated with poorer prognosis.

===Angiogenesis for cardiovascular disease===
Angiogenesis represents an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely &quot;neoangiogenesis&quot;: the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world with these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.

These failures suggested that either these are the wrong molecular targets to induce neovascularization, that they can only be effectively used if formulated and administered correctly, or that their presentation in the context of the overall cellular microenvironment may play a vital role in their utility. It may be necessary to present these proteins in a way that mimics natural signaling events, including the concentration, spatial and temporal profiles, and their simultaneous or sequential presentation with other appropriate factors.

===Exercise===
Angiogenesis is generally associated with aerobic exercise and endurance exercise. While arteriogenesis produces network changes that allow for a large increase in the amount of total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery over a long period of time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery.

===Macular degeneration===
Overexpression of VEGF causes increased permeability in blood vessels in addition to stimulating angiogenesis. In wet macular degeneration, VEGF causes proliferation of capillaries into the retina. Since the increase in angiogenesis also causes edema, blood and other retinal fluids leak into the retina, causing loss of vision. Anti-angiogenic drugs targeting the VEGF pathways are now used successfully to treat this type of macular degeneration

===Tissue engineered constructs===
Angiogenesis of vessels from the host body into an implanted tissue engineered constructs is essential. Successful integration is often dependent on thorough vascularisation of the construct as it provides oxygen and nutrients and prevents necrosis in the central areas of the implant. PDGF has been shown to stabilize vascularisation in collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds.

==History==
The first report of angiogenesis can be traced back to the book &quot;A treatise on the blood, inflammation, and gun-shot wounds&quot; published in 1794, where Scottish anatomist John Hunter&#x27;s research findings were compiled. In his study, Hunter observed the growth process of new blood vessels in rabbits. However, he did not coin the term &quot;Angiogenesis,&quot; which is now widely used by scholars. Hunter also erroneously attributed the growth process of new blood vessels to the effect of an innate vital principle within the blood. The term &quot;angiogenesis&quot; is believed to have emerged not until the 1900s. The inception of modern angiogenesis research is marked by Judah Folkman&#x27;s report on the pivotal role of angiogenesis in tumor growth.

==Quantification==
Quantifying vasculature parameters such as microvascular density has various complications due to preferential staining or limited representation of tissues by histological sections. Recent research has shown complete 3D reconstruction of tumor vascular structure and quantification of vessel structures in whole tumors in animal models.
