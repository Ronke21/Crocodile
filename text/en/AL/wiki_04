<text>The Army of Northern Virginia was the primary military force of the Confederate States of America in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. It was also the primary command structure of the Department of Northern Virginia. It was most often arrayed against the Union Army of the Potomac.

==History==
===Origin===

The name Army of Northern Virginia referred to its primary area of operation, which was typical of most Confederate States Army names. The Army originated as the Army of the Potomac, which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in Northern Virginia. On July 20 and July 21, the Army of the Shenandoah and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the Army of the Northwest were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed the Army of Northern Virginia on March 14. The Army of the Peninsula was merged into it on April 12, 1862.

Robert E. Lee&#x27;s biographer, Douglas S. Freeman, asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862. However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Joseph E. Johnston, his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston&#x27;s command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department&#x27;s name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect.

In addition to Virginians, it included regiments from all over the Confederacy, some from as far away as Georgia, Texas, and Arkansas. One of the most well known was the Texas Brigade, made up of the 1st, 4th, and 5th Texas, and the 3rd Arkansas, which distinguished themselves in numerous battles, such as during their fight for the Devil&#x27;s Den at the Battle of Gettysburg. Although West Virginia became a Union state in 1863, Virginia&#x27;s western counties had contributed between 20,000 and 22,000 men. They greatly outnumbered their Union counterparts at Gettysburg, though the latter received four monuments from West Virginia. Missouri was also represented by a company of cavalry known as the 1st Missouri Cavalry, Co. A. They suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of New Market in 1864.

===Beauregard&#x27;s command===

The first commander of the Army of Northern Virginia was General P. G. T. Beauregard, under its previous name, the Confederate Army of the Potomac, from June 20 to July 20, 1861. His forces consisted of six brigades, with various militia and artillery from the former Department of Alexandria. During his command, Beauregard is noted for creating the battle flag of the army, which came to be the primary battle flag for all corps and forces under the Army of Northern Virginia. The flag was designed due to confusion during battle between the Confederate Stars and Bars flag and the flag of the United States. Beauregard continued commanding these troops as the new First Corps under Gen. J. E. Johnston as it was joined by the Army of the Shenandoah on July 20, 1861, when command was relinquished to General J. E. Johnston. The following day this army fought its first major engagement in the First Battle of Manassas.

===Johnston&#x27;s command===

With the merging of the Army of the Shenandoah, General Joseph E. Johnston took command from July 20, 1861, until May 31, 1862.

====Corps organization under Johnston 1861====
* First Corps – commanded by General P.G.T. Beauregard
* Second Corps – commanded by Maj. Gen. G. W. Smith

====Wing organization under Johnston 1862====
* Left Wing – commanded by Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill
* Center Wing – commanded by Maj. Gen. James Longstreet
* Right Wing – commanded by Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder
* Reserve – commanded by Maj. Gen. G. W. Smith

Under the command of Johnston, the Army immediately entered into the First Battle of Manassas. On October 22, 1861, the Department of Northern Virginia was officially created, officially ending the Army of the Potomac. The department comprised three districts: Aquia District, Potomac District, and the Valley District. In April 1862, the department was expanded to include the Departments of Norfolk and the Peninsula (of Virginia). Johnston was eventually forced into maneuvering the Army southward to the defenses of Richmond during the opening of the Peninsula Campaign, where it conducted delay and defend tactics until Johnston was severely wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines.

During the months after the First Battle of Bull Run, Johnston organized his Shenandoah Army and Beauregard&#x27;s Potomac Army into two divisions under a unified command with Gustavus Smith and James Longstreet as division commanders. Beauregard quarreled with Johnston and was transferred to the Western theater over the winter months. Jackson was sent to the Shenandoah Valley in October 1861, initially with his own old Stonewall Brigade and later with two other brigades from Western Virginia. Several newly arrived brigades were added to Johnston&#x27;s army in late 1861-early 1862.

When the Peninsula Campaign began, Johnston took his army down to the Richmond environs where it was merged with several smaller Confederate commands, including a division led by D.H. Hill as well as Benjamin Huger&#x27;s Department of Norfolk, John Magruder&#x27;s Army of the Peninsula, and miscellaneous brigades and regiments pulled from various Southern states. Richard Ewell was elevated to division command in the spring of 1862 and sent to join Jackson in the Valley.

On May 27, an additional new division was created and led by A.P. Hill consisting of several new brigades from the Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia, soon augmented with James Archer&#x27;s brigade from Smith&#x27;s division. At Seven Pines, Longstreet and Smith served as temporary wing commanders, and operational control of their divisions went to Brig. Gen William H.C. Whiting and Brig. Gen Richard H. Anderson.

===Smith&#x27;s temporary command===

Maj. Gen. Gustavus Woodson Smith commanded the Army of Northern Virginia on May 31, 1862, following the wounding of Gen. J. E. Johnston during the Battle of Seven Pines. With Smith seemingly having a nervous breakdown, President Jefferson Davis drafted orders to place Gen. Robert E. Lee in command the following day.

===Lee&#x27;s command===

On June 1, 1862, General Robert E. Lee, its final and best known leader historically, took command after Johnston was wounded and Smith suffered what may have been a nervous breakdown at the Battle of Seven Pines. William Whiting received permanent command of Smith&#x27;s division, while Richard Anderson reverted to brigade command. Longstreet served as a wing commander for part of the Seven Days Battles and Anderson had operational command of the division at Glendale.

The cavalry, organized into a division on August 17, 1862, and into a corps on September 9, 1863, was commanded by Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart until May 11, 1864 (the day he was mortally wounded). The cavalry corps was then temporarily split into divisions, but was merged again on August 11, 1864, under command of Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III. The Reserve Artillery was commanded by Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton for most of the war.

During the Seven Days Battles, Lee had eleven separate divisions under his command. Aside from the original core army that had been led by Johnston, there were assorted other commands from the Richmond area and North Carolina, as well as Jackson&#x27;s Valley Army. The inexperience and poor coordination of the army led to the failure of Lee&#x27;s plans to destroy the Army of the Potomac. As soon as the Seven Days Battles were over, Lee reorganized his army into two corps commanded by Jackson and Longstreet. He removed several generals who had turned in a less-than-inspiring performance in the Seven Days Battles, including John Magruder and Benjamin Huger.

Jackson had five divisions, the commands of A.P. Hill, Ewell, D.H. Hill, and Winder. Longstreet had six divisions commanded by Richard Anderson (formerly Benjamin Huger&#x27;s division), Cadmus M. Wilcox, James L. Kemper (each commanding half of Longstreet&#x27;s former division), John Bell Hood (formerly William Whiting&#x27;s division), David Rumph Jones, and Lafayette McLaws. D.H. Hill&#x27;s and McLaws&#x27;s divisions were left behind in the Richmond area and did not participate in the Northern Virginia campaign. The army was also joined for the Northern Virginia and Maryland Campaigns by Nathan G. Evans&#x27;s independent South Carolina brigade and a North Carolina brigade led by Brig. Gen Thomas Drayton.

During the Maryland campaign, D.H. Hill rejoined the main army along with Lafayette McLaws. Kemper&#x27;s division was merged with the division of David R. Jones, a more senior, experienced officer, and Kemper reverted to brigade command. In addition, Robert Ransom commanded two brigades from the Department of North Carolina. At Antietam, Longstreet commanded the divisions of Anderson, McLaws, Jones, Hood, and Ransom while Jackson had the divisions of John R. Jones, Alexander Lawton, A.P. Hill, and D.H. Hill.

The Northern Virginia and Maryland Campaigns still showed numerous defects in the organization and leadership of the Army of Northern Virginia, particularly the high rate of straggling and desertion during the invasion of Maryland. Lee had fewer than 40,000 men on the field at Antietam, the smallest his army would be until the Appomattox Campaign.

During the Fredericksburg Campaign, Longstreet had the divisions of Anderson, Hood, McLaws, Ransom, and George Pickett, who had just returned to action after months of convalescence from a wound sustained at the Battle of Gaines&#x27;s Mill. Jackson had the divisions of D.H. Hill, A.P. Hill, Jubal Early, and Elisha Paxton. Robert Ransom&#x27;s division returned to North Carolina after Fredericksburg. D.H. Hill also departed after quarreling with Lee.

In the Chancellorsville Campaign, Longstreet was sent with Pickett and Hood to the Richmond area. His other two divisions remained with the main army; they were directly commanded by Lee during this time. Robert Rodes took over D.H. Hill&#x27;s division. Jackson was mortally wounded during the Battle of Chancellorsville. Afterwards, Lee divided the army into three corps with three divisions each. Longstreet got the divisions of Pickett, McLaws, and Hood; A.P. Hill got the divisions of Harry Heth, William D. Pender, and Richard Anderson; and Richard Ewell (returning to action after almost a year of recovering from the loss of a leg at Second Bull Run) got the divisions of Robert Rodes, Jubal Early, and Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson. A Fourth Corps, under Lt. Gen. Richard H. Anderson, was organized on October 19, 1864; on April 8, 1865, it was merged into the Second Corps. The commanders of the first three corps changed frequently in 1864 and 1865.

By the time of the Pennsylvania invasion, Lee had fixed the organizational defects that plagued the army during its early campaigns and the straggling problems of the Maryland Campaign did not repeat themselves.

After taking over command in mid-1862, Lee began preparing to lead the Army of Northern Virginia for the first time. However, his aggressiveness to attack the Union led to the loss of many troops especially at the Battle of Antietam, which ended up being a turning point in the war for the Union. After the costly victories during the Seven Days Battles and at Second Manassas in August 1862, Lee had now lost a total of 30,000 of his approximately 92,000 troops within three months of becoming the Confederate&#x27;s top general. Lee then planned to take his troops north into Maryland to destroy a critical railroad bridge across the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg in a letter written to President Davis. Lee even questioned his own plan, as he wrote, &quot;I am aware that the movement is attended with much risk, yet I do not consider success impossible...&quot; In addition, historians question Lee&#x27;s aggressiveness to move his army to Maryland. &quot;There can be no sort of doubt that Lee underestimated the exhaustion of his army after Second Manassas. That is, in reality, the major criticism of the Maryland operation: he carried worn-out men across the Potomac.&quot; His men were also underarmed and underfed, so the journey to Maryland added to the overall exhaustion. Once Lee arrived in Maryland and was preparing for Antietam, he made another controversial decision. Against the advice from General Longstreet and Jackson, Lee split his troops into four parts to attack the Union from different fronts. Clearly outnumbered and opposed to Lee&#x27;s plan, Longstreet stated, &quot;General, I wish we could stand still and let the damned Yankees come to us!&quot; As the fighting played out on September 17, 1862, known as the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, the battles at Dunker Church and Burnside&#x27;s Bridge proved to be too much for Lee and his Confederate army. Luckily for Lee, the arrival of A.P. Hill&#x27;s troops and the mixture of McClellan&#x27;s and Burnside&#x27;s sluggishness, saved Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia and allowed them to barely hold off the Union in Maryland.

====Corps organization under Lee====
Although the Army of Northern Virginia swelled and shrank over time, its units of organization consisted primarily of corps, earlier referred to as &quot;wings&quot; or &quot;commands&quot;:
* First Corps (&quot;Longstreet&#x27;s Corps&quot;)
* Second Corps (&quot;Jackson&#x27;s Corps&quot; in 1862/1863)
* Third Corps (&quot;A.P. Hill&#x27;s Corps&quot;)
* Fourth Corps (&quot;Anderson&#x27;s Corps&quot;)
* Cavalry Corps

==Campaigns and battles==
The Army fought in a number of campaigns and battles, including:

On April 9, 1865, the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to the Army of the Potomac at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War, with General Lee signing the papers of surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant. The day after his surrender, Lee issued his Farewell Address to the Army of Northern Virginia.

==Organization of the Army==
===Department of Northern Virginia, October 22, 1861===

The Military Department of Northern Virginia was embattled on October 22, 1861. The department initially consisted of three districts under the overall command of General Joseph E. Johnston.
On February 28, 1862, there were 47,617 soldiers present for duty to the military district. The Cavalry Brigade was provided from the Potomac&#x27;s Military District and under direct control from the Defense District. The artillery formed an Artillery Corps with 109 cannons.

===Organization April 30, 1862===

The Army of Northern Virginia was established on March 14, 1862, again under Johnston. Though the military department stayed existent its role changed into an administrative division for most of the war.

At the outset of the Peninsula Campaign the Army of Northern Virginia had more than 55,633 soldiers. The cannon was assigned to the brigades, as well as the Reserve&#x27;s artillery. Nominally, Jackson&#x27;s Corps in the Shenandoah Valley, was subordinate to the Army. Since Jackson led his own campaign at the time of the Peninsula Campaign and was not under Lee&#x27;s direct command this overview does not include his three divisions.

The Army&#x27;s organization soon proved inept in the course of the Peninsula Campaign. The corps-like structure was rearranged before the Seven Days Battle to converge with the requirements of actual command. In the course of this battle the Army featured two Corps; Jackson&#x27;s and Magruder&#x27;s, with four and three divisions respectively, and three actual divisions with five to six brigades. Also the Defense District of North Carolina answered directly to the Army as well as the Reserve Artillery with six battalions and the cavalry with six regiments. The army&#x27;s complete strength was about 90,000 soldiers. The exact strength cannot be determined, because only a few notes for actual provisionings survived. The estimated strength results, if not explicitly noted, from in-battle dispatches.

===Organization at the setout of the Northern Virginia Campaign===
The Seven Days Battle showed the Army still suffered from insufficient organization in army command. General Lee subdivided the army again, but this time only with single commands. He introduced a corps-like structure of command, and as an intermediate army management he named the left and right wing. The Army was organized on August 28, 1862, as follows.
The Army&#x27;s Reserve Artillery consisted of one regiment and two battalions. They stayed in the area of Richmond in the course of the whole Northern Virginia Campaign and only returned on September 3, 1862, to the Army. Major General Hill&#x27;s Division also remained in the eastern parts of Richmond with the order to bind McClellan&#x27;s attention as long as possible. As it became predictable that the Army of the Potomac would soon be transferred to support Pope, Lee ordered the Division north. Hill never entered battle in the campaign. A total of about 54,000 soldiers saw action throughout the campaign.

===Organization at the beginning of the Maryland Campaign===
The Army&#x27;s losses before and following the Battle of Second Manassas needed to be replaced before the Maryland Campaign could commence. While fundamental changes in the Army&#x27;s command structure were not necessary, General Lee exchanged divisions and brigades or added additional strength to some. The wings of the Army were now officially called &#x27;Corps&#x27;. In the Maryland Campaign the Army was subdivided as follows.


While organization of the corps was found to be generally reliable, the corps&#x27; subdivision into four or five divisions hampered overall ease of command. General Lee had already considered before the Battle of Antietam to slim down the overall structure, but intended there be no changes in leadership. The Confederate Congress authorized the establishment of the Corps, and President Davis affirmed the assignment of the commanders and promoted Major Generals Longstreet and Jackson to Lieutenant Generals. General Lee announced this in Special Order 234 on November 6, 1862. About 60,000 soldiers served at the Maryland Campaign.

=== Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville ===
In the days following the Battle of Chancellorsville there were no changes in the army&#x27;s command structure or hierarchy. The army replaced its own losses with new recruits and soldiers returning to duty. Lee made demands that all regiments had to be consolidated solely with recruits originating from their corresponding home states.

Following the Battle of Fredericksburg the Army of Northern Virginia could muster over 72,497 soldiers not counting other personnel. Not figuring into this overall number is the fact that Lee had made the decision to station a whole division and a single cavalry brigade at Shenandoah Valley for protection at this time and these troops are missing from the total estimates.

During the autumn of 1862 lasting throughout the following winter the army faced the Army of the Potomac at Rappahannock. Thereout arose a new problem: Because of the necessity to always show its presence to the enemy there were only limited supplies available for the army from the surrounding villages and towns. Any army at these times supplied itself along the way while moving across the theater of war. Even ordering supplies through the use of the rail, if it was an available option at all, took up considerable time and efforts and supply treks by wagons were potentially prone to enemy assaults. This left Lee with few options and therefore he gave the special order on December 24, 1862, to move half of his artillery into the hinterlands to have his horses better supplied. He forbade to assign all of the horses to any other task than official assignments.

On February 15, 1863, Lee rearranged his artillery. Six battalions were assigned to both corps, and the reserve was composed out of two more battalions. The Confederate War Department strongly suggested in position papers to Lee dating from the February 18th, 1862 to station two divisions at the Atlantic coast. Lee was not averse to any such demands, probably very much on the contrary, because of the tight position he was in with the general lack of provisions, so he gave orders to General Longstreet to have it done so. Both of the assigned divisions only returned to join the Army of Northern Virginia again following the Battle of Chancellorsville. The army was composed at this battle out of over 61.500 soldiers.

===Organization from May 30, 1863, until April 9, 1865===
Lee took Jackson&#x27;s death as an opportunity to subdivide the North Virginia Corps again. President Jefferson Davis agreed to the subdivision and ordered Lee in his Special Order Nr. 146 to reorganize the Army.

Lee ordered the artillery battalions of the Reserve Artillery to serve directly with the Corps for the duration of the Gettysburg Campaign. The Army of Northern Virginia now comprised a total of 75,054 soldiers at the Battle of Gettysburg.

The army fielded more than 241 cannons following the Battle of Gettysburg.

On September 9, General Lee had to dispatch the First Corps to Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee. Following this the army was resubordinated again. Changes were not significant; only the cavalry saw important reorganization.

The Army&#x27;s strength was then 55,221 soldiers. The changes in command until December 31, 1863, were only minor. Cooke&#x27;s Brigade was assigned to serve with Heth&#x27;s Division, Hampton&#x27;s Division grew by a cavalry brigade and the Third Corps gained an additional artillery battalion. Imboden&#x27;s Command remained at Shenandoah Valley and was taken over by Major General Early as the Defense District of Shenandoah Valley. The strength of the army was 54,715 men on December 31.

The organization of the Army of Northern Virginia did not change until the end of the war. The Army featured several corps, the corps featured several divisions, and the artillery was divided between the corps. The strength of the Army grew in the first six months from about 46,380 to 62,230 soldiers. The army was assigned in July to the Defense District of North Carolina and Richmond. In the course of the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign the number of soldiers temporarily grew to 82,633 while parts of the Army were under the command by Lieutenant General Early in Shenandoah Valley.
In 1864, the Army of Northern Virginia fought forces over twice as strong as that of the Potomac, James and Shenandoah Army in Grant&#x27;s Overland Campaign, Early&#x27;s Raid against the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign, and Shenandoah Campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. The Army reorganized on January 31, 1865 because 69,659 soldiers were fit for battle, but 4,500 or more had no rifles.
==Defeat and surrender==
Following Lieutenant General A.P. Hill&#x27;s death on April 2, 1865, the Third Corps was dissolved and assigned to the First Corps. On April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered. One day later he thanked his men and his officers for their bravery and sturdiness and announced the dismissal of all troops on their word of honor in General Order No. 9. The listings of the Army of Northern Virginia say that 28,231 soldiers were dismissed on their word of honor on April 10, 1865.

<doc id="58161" wikidata="Q490600" url="?curid=58161" title="Dust devil">
<text>A dust devil (also known regionally as a dirt devil) is a strong, well-formed, and relatively short-lived whirlwind. Its size ranges from small (18 in/half a metre wide and a few yards/metres tall) to large (more than 30 ft/10 m wide and more than half a mile/1 km tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.

They are comparable to tornadoes in that both are a weather phenomenon involving a vertically oriented rotating column of wind. Most tornadoes are associated with a larger parent circulation, the mesocyclone on the back of a supercell thunderstorm. Dust devils form as a swirling updraft under sunny conditions during fair weather, rarely coming close to the intensity of a tornado.

== Formation ==

Dust devils form when a pocket of hot air near the surface rises quickly through cooler air above it, forming an updraft. If conditions are just right, the updraft may begin to rotate. As the air rapidly rises, the column of hot air is stretched vertically, thereby moving mass closer to the axis of rotation, which causes intensification of the spinning effect by conservation of angular momentum. The secondary flow in the dust devil causes other hot air to speed horizontally inward to the bottom of the newly forming vortex. As more hot air rushes in toward the developing vortex to replace the air that is rising, the spinning effect becomes further intensified and self-sustaining. A dust devil, fully formed, is a funnel-like chimney through which hot air moves, both upwards and in a circle. As the hot air rises, it cools, loses its buoyancy and eventually ceases to rise. As it rises, it displaces air which descends outside the core of the vortex. This cool air returning acts as a balance against the spinning hot-air outer wall and keeps the system stable.

The spinning effect, along with surface friction, usually will produce a forward momentum. The dust devil may be sustained if it moves over nearby sources of hot surface air.

As available hot air near the surface is channelled up the dust devil, eventually surrounding cooler air will be sucked in. Once it occurs, the effect is dramatic, and the dust devil dissipates in seconds. Usually it occurs when the dust devil is moving slowly (depletion) or begins to enter a terrain where the surface temperatures are cooler.

Certain conditions increase the likelihood of dust devil formation.
* Flat barren terrain, desert or tarmac: Flat conditions increase the likelihood of the hot-air &quot;fuel&quot; being a near constant. Dusty or sandy conditions will cause particles to become caught up in the vortex, making the dust devil easily visible, but are not necessary for the formation of the vortex.
* Clear skies or lightly cloudy conditions: The surface needs to absorb significant amounts of solar energy to heat the air near the surface and create ideal dust devil conditions.
* Light or no wind and cool atmospheric temperature: The underlying factor for sustainability of a dust devil is the extreme difference in temperature between the near-surface air and the atmosphere. Windy conditions will destabilize the spinning effect of a dust devil.

== Intensity and duration ==
Many dust devils are usually small and weak, often less than 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter with maximum winds averaging about 45 miles per hour (70 km/h), and they often dissipate less than a minute after forming. On rare occasions, a dust devil can grow very large and intense, sometimes reaching a diameter of up to 300 feet (90 m) with winds in excess of 60 mph (100 km/h+) and can last for upwards of 20 minutes before dissipating. Because of their small diameter, Coriolis force is not significant in the dust devil itself so dust devils with anticyclonic rotation do occur.

==Hazards==
Dust devils typically do not cause injuries, but rare, severe dust devils have caused damage and even deaths in the past. One such dust devil struck the Coconino County Fairgrounds in Flagstaff, Arizona, on September 14, 2000, causing extensive damage to several temporary tents, stands and booths, as well as some permanent fairgrounds structures. Several injuries were reported, but there were no fatalities. Based on the degree of damage left behind, it is estimated that the dust devil produced winds as high as 75 mph (120 km/h), which is equivalent to an EF0 tornado. On May 19, 2003, a dust devil lifted the roof off a two-story building in Lebanon, Maine, causing it to collapse and kill a man inside. On June 18, 2008, a woman near Casper, Wyoming was killed when a dust devil caused a small scorer&#x27;s shed at a youth baseball field to flip on top of her. She had been trying to shelter from the dust devil by going behind the shed. At East El Paso, Texas in 2010, three children in an inflatable jump house were picked up by a dust devil and lifted over 10 feet (3 m), travelling over a fence and landing in a backyard three houses away. In Commerce City, Colorado in 2018, a powerful dust devil hurtled two porta-potties into the air; no one was injured. In 2019, a large dust devil in Yucheng county, Henan province, China killed 2 children and injured 18 children and 2 adults when an inflatable jump house was lifted into the air.

Dust devils have been implicated in around 100 aircraft accidents. While many incidents have been simple taxiing problems, a few have had fatal consequences. Dust devils are also considered major hazards among skydivers and paragliding pilots as they can cause a parachute or a paraglider to collapse with little to no warning, at altitudes considered too low to cut away, and contribute to the serious injury or death of parachutists. Such was the case on June 1, 1996, when a dust devil caused a skydiver&#x27;s parachute to collapse about above the ground. He later died from the injuries he sustained. Dust devils can also contribute to wildfires. One case occurred in Engebæk, Billund Municipality, Denmark in 1868 where a dust devil tossed tuft into a heater, causing a wildfire that possibly extended from 10,000 to 50,000 hectares or more.

== Electrical activities ==
Dust devils, even small ones, can produce radio noise and electrical fields greater than 10,000 volts per meter. A dust devil picks up small dirt and dust particles. As the particles whirl around, they become electrically charged through contact or frictional charging (triboelectrification). The whirling charged particles also create a magnetic field that fluctuates between 3 and 30 times each second.

These electric fields may assist the vortices in lifting material off the ground and into the atmosphere. Field experiments indicate that a dust devil can lift 1 gram of dust per second from each square metre (10 lb/s from each acre) of ground over which it passes. A large dust devil measuring about 100 metres (330 ft) across at its base can lift about 15 metric tonnes (17 short tons) of dust into the air in 30 minutes. Giant dust storms that sweep across the world&#x27;s deserts contribute 8% of the mineral dust in the atmosphere each year during the handful of storms that occur. In comparison, the significantly smaller dust devils that twist across the deserts during the summer lift about three times as much dust, thus having a greater combined impact on the dust content of the atmosphere. When this occurs, they are often called sand pillars.

== Martian dust devils ==


== Alternate names ==
In Australia, a dust devil is more commonly known as &quot;Willy willy&quot;.
In Ireland, dust devils are known as &quot;sí gaoithe&quot; or &quot;fairy wind&quot;.

== Related phenomena ==

=== Ash devils ===
Hot cinders underneath freshly deposited ash in recently burned areas may sometimes generate numerous dust devils. The lighter weight and the darker color of the ash may create dust devils that are visible hundreds of feet into the air.

Ash devils form similar to dust devils and are often seen on unstable days in burn scar areas of recent fires.

Coal devils are common at the coal town of Tsagaan Khad in South Gobi Province, Mongolia. They occur when dust devils pick up large amounts of stockpiled coal. Their dark color makes them resemble some tornadoes.

=== Fire whirls ===

Fire whirls or swirls, sometimes called fire devils or fire tornadoes, can be seen during intense fires in combustible building structures or, more commonly, in forest or bush fires. A fire whirl is a vortex-shaped formation of burning gases being released from the combustible material. The genesis of the vortex is probably similar to a dust devil&#x27;s. As distinct from the dust devil, it is improbable that the height reached by the fire gas vortex is greater than the visible height of the vertical flames because of turbulence in the surrounding gases that inhibit creation of a stable boundary layer between the rotating/rising gases relative to the surrounding gases.

===Hay devils===
A &quot;hay devil&quot; is a gentle whirlwind that forms in the warm air above fields of freshly-cut hay. A vortex forms from a column of hot air rising from the ground on calm, sunny days, tossing and swirling stalks and clumps of hay harmlessly through the air, often to the delight of children and onlookers.

===Snow devils===
The same conditions can produce a &quot;snow whirlwind&quot;, &quot;snow devil&quot;, or sometimes referred to as a &quot;snownado&quot;, although differential heating is more difficult in snow-covered areas.

=== Steam devils ===

Steam devils are a small vortex column of saturated air of varying height but small diameter forming when cold air lies over a much warmer body of water or saturated surface. They are also often observed in the steam rising from power plants.

<text>An alliance is a relationship among people, groups, or states that have joined together for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not an explicit agreement has been worked out among them. Members of an alliance are called allies. Alliances form in many settings, including political alliances, military alliances, and business alliances. When the term is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also be called allied powers, especially when discussing World War I or World War II.

A formal military alliance is not required to be perceived as an ally—co-belligerence, fighting alongside someone, is enough. According to this usage, allies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war.

When spelled with a capital &quot;A&quot;, &quot;Allies&quot; usually denotes the countries who fought together against the Central Powers in World War; I (the Allies of World War I), or those who fought against the Axis Powers in World War II (the Allies of World War II). The term has also been used by the United States Army to describe the countries that gave assistance to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

The Allied Powers in World War I (also known as the Entente Powers) were initially the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Empire, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro and Japan, joined later by Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Greece and Brazil. Some, such as the Russian Empire, withdrew from the war before the armistice due to revolution or defeat.

After the end of World War II and during the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed as a political and military alliance that promotes anti-communist values.

More recently, the term &quot;Allied forces&quot; has also been used to describe the coalition of the Gulf War, as opposed to forces the Multi-National Forces in Iraq which are commonly referred to as &quot;Coalition forces&quot; or, as by the George W. Bush administration, &quot;the coalition of the willing&quot;.

== Effects ==
Scholars are divided as to the impact of alliances. Several studies find that defensive alliances deter conflict. One study questions these findings, showing that alliance commitments deterred conflict in the prenuclear era but has no statistically meaningful impact on war in the postnuclear era. Another study finds that while alliance commitments deter conflict between sides with a recent history of conflict, alliances tend to provoke conflicts between states without such a history.

A 2000 study in the &quot;Journal of Conflict Resolution&quot; found that allies fulfill their alliance commitments approximately 75% of the time. Most research suggests that democracies are more reliable allies than non-democracies. A 2004 study did however question whether alliance commitments by democracies are more durable. A 2018 study updated and extended the data from the 2000 &quot;Journal of Conflict Resolution&quot; study and found that allies only fulfill their commitments about 50% of the time from 1816 to 2003. According to the study, &quot;States honored their alliance commitments 66% of the time prior to 1945 but the compliance rate drops to 22% from 1945 to 2003. Moreover, the rates of fulfillment for defense pacts (41%) and nonaggression pacts (37%) are dramatically lower than offensive alliances (74%) and neutrality agreements (78%).&quot;

One of the most profound effects of alliances can be seen in technological innovation, due to conduits of knowledge flows that are open between allies but closed between rivals.

==International opinion==

According to a 2017 poll by WIN/GIA, the United States was the most preferred ally internationally. Russia and China, who preferred one another, both trailed America globally. Four countries, Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia and Turkey, preferred Russia, despite being members of NATO.

In Pakistan, 72% of respondents preferred ties to China, the largest margin of any country surveyed, while 46% of Bangladesh preferred India. A total of 22 countries indicated a preference for the United Kingdom at a rate of 10% or more, but the United States was the only country to prefer Britain over any other, at a rate of 43%. Five countries preferred France at a rate of 10% or more, led by Belgium at a rate of 25%. A single country, Iraq, expressed no preference, while three other countries, Lebanon, Palestine, and Slovenia, expressed no preference at a rate of 11% or more, although at a smaller rate than their preference for Russia on the part of Lebanon and Slovenia, and China on the part of Palestine. Kosovo reported the most unified opinion, preferring the United States at a rate of 92%, while Russia&#x27;s most unified supporters were Mongolia (71%), Armenia (67%) and Serbia (56%). In total, 21 countries expressed a preference for America at a rate of 50% or more.

<doc id="58163" wikidata="Q26098" url="?curid=58163" title="Lonely Mountain">
<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, the Lonely Mountain is a mountain northeast of Mirkwood. It is the location of the Dwarves&#x27; Kingdom under the Mountain and the town of Dale lies in a vale on its southern slopes.
In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the mountain is called by the Sindarin name Erebor. The Lonely Mountain is the destination of the protagonists, including the titular Hobbit Bilbo Baggins in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and is the scene of the novel&#x27;s climax.

The mountain has been described as the goal of Bilbo&#x27;s psychological quest in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;; scholars have noted that it and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are both structured as quests to a distant mountain, but that the quests have very different motivations. Further, the mountain is a symbol of adventure in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and of Bilbo&#x27;s maturation as an individual, while to the Dwarves, it stands for the gain of beauty in return for loss of life.

==Fictional mountain==
Erebor stands hundreds of miles from the nearest mountain range. Tolkien&#x27;s rendering of Thrór&#x27;s map in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; shows it with six ridges stretching out from a central peak that was snowcapped well into spring. The whole mountain is some ten miles in diameter; it contains an immense wealth of gold and jewels.

=== Origins ===

Erebor becomes the home of the Folk of Durin, a clan of Dwarves known as the Longbeards, after they are driven from their ancestral home of Khazad-dûm. In the latter days of the Third Age, this Kingdom under the Mountain holds one of the largest dwarvish treasure hoards in Middle-earth. Dale, a town of Men built between the two southern spurs of Erebor, grew in harmony with the dwarves. The Kingdom under the Mountain is founded by Thráin I the Old, who had discovered the Arkenstone there. His son, Thorin I, leaves the mountain with much of the Folk of Durin to live in the Ered Mithrin (Grey Mountains) on account of the great riches to be found in that range. After dragons plunder their hoards, the Longbeards, led now by Thrór, a descendant of Thorin, return to Erebor to take up the title King under the Mountain. Under Thrór&#x27;s reign, Erebor becomes a great stronghold where the dwarves are numerous and prosperous.

=== Erebor in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; ===


In the Third Age, while the young Thorin II Oakenshield is out hunting, the dragon Smaug flies south from the Grey Mountains, kills all the dwarves he could find, and destroys the town of Dale. Smaug takes over the mountain, using the dwarves&#x27; hoard as a bed. King Thrór, his son Thráin II, and several companions escape death by a secret door. While Thrór and Thráin later perish, Thorin lives in exile in the Ered Luin, far to the west. On a journey, he meets the wizard Gandalf. Together they form a plan to reclaim the mountain. Gandalf insists that burglary is the best approach and recommends the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.

Bilbo, Thorin, and Thorin&#x27;s company of twelve other Dwarves travel to the Lonely Mountain to regain the treasure. They plan to use the secret door, whose key and map Gandalf had obtained from Thráin, whom he had found at the point of death in the pits of Dol Guldur. On Durin&#x27;s Day, when the setting sun and the last moon of autumn are in the sky together, the day&#x27;s last sunlight falls on the door and exposes its keyhole. The Hobbit enters the mountain and steals a golden cup.

Smaug, enraged by the theft, emerges from the mountain and flies south to destroy Lake-town, which he suspects is the source of the &quot;thieves&quot;. During this attack Smaug is killed by Bard the Bowman; Thorin claims the mountain on learning of Smaug&#x27;s demise. However, the Men of Esgaroth, supported by Thranduil and the Elves of Mirkwood, march in force to the mountain to demand a part of the dragon&#x27;s hoard as recompense for the destruction. Thorin, mad with greed, refuses all claims and sends word to his second cousin Dáin II Ironfoot, chief of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills, who bring reinforcements. Before battle can begin, an army of Orcs and Wargs descends on Erebor. Dwarves, Elves, and Men join ranks against them, leading to the Battle of Five Armies. Thorin&#x27;s nephews Fíli and Kíli are killed, and Thorin is mortally injured; he dies shortly afterwards. The title of King under the Mountain passes to Dáin.

=== Erebor in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

With the restoration of the Kingdom under the Mountain, the area becomes prosperous again. Dale is rebuilt under Bard&#x27;s leadership, and Dwarves and Men reforge their friendship. Some of the Dwarves, led by Balin, leave Erebor to reclaim the ancient Dwarvish Kingdom of Moria. They established a colony there but five years later Balin is killed by an Orc, and soon afterwards Moria is overrun by Orcs and the rest of the Dwarves are killed. Gimli, a dwarf of Erebor and the son of Glóin, one of Thorin&#x27;s twelve companions, is chosen to represent his people in the Fellowship of the Ring; he helps Aragorn regain the throne of Gondor.

In the War of the Ring, an emissary from Sauron, the lord of Mordor, twice comes to Erebor and speaks to Dáin. The messenger asks for assistance in finding Bilbo Baggins and retrieving a stolen ring, and in return offers Moria and three of the seven Dwarf rings to Dáin, who declines to reply. Sauron&#x27;s northern army, including many Easterlings, then attacks; Dale is overrun, and many Dwarves and Men take refuge in Erebor, which is promptly surrounded. Dáin is killed before the gates of Erebor defending the body of his fallen ally King Brand of Dale. Dáin&#x27;s son Thorin III Stonehelm and King Bard II withstand the siege and rout Sauron&#x27;s forces.

== Analysis ==

=== Goal of psychological quest ===

The Jungian psychoanalyst Dorothy Matthews, viewing &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a psychological quest, writes that the Lonely Mountain is an apt symbol of Bilbo&#x27;s maturation as an individual, as the place where he takes on a leadership role and acts and makes decisions independently. The Tolkien scholar Jared Lobdell comments that he is &quot;profoundly unsympathetic&quot; to Matthews&#x27;s approach, but that she &quot;carries it off well&quot;. Lobdell explains, citing C. S. Lewis&#x27;s essay &quot;Psychoanalysis and Literary Criticism&quot;, that many different stories could, for instance, have the same Freudian interpretation, but be quite different as literature. He remarks on the other hand that a psychoanalytic approach is at least richer than a purely materialistic one.

The scholar of children&#x27;s literature William H. Green calls the Lonely Mountain the fourth and final stage of Bilbo&#x27;s education. He identifies multiple parallels and repetitions of structure between the stages, each one involving a journey, privation, and &quot;unlikely escape&quot;. The Lonely Mountain stage, too, symbolically echoes the first stage in the Shire: before setting out, Bilbo was peacefully smoking a pipe of tobacco at his own front door; at the mountain, the smoke is the dragon&#x27;s, and its meaning is anything but peaceful. The Christian writer Joseph Pearce views the journey to the Lonely Mountain as a &quot;pilgrimage of grace&quot;, a Christian &quot;bildungsroman&quot;, at its deepest level. Pearce states further that Bilbo&#x27;s quest to the mountain parallels Frodo&#x27;s quest to a different mountain, Mount Doom, which he calls &quot;a mirror of Everyman&#x27;s journey through life&quot;.

Two scholars of literature, Paul Kocher and Randel Helms analyse Bilbo&#x27;s journey to the lonely mountain, describing it as the goal of his quest and the point at which it is achieved. Both compare the quest in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; with that of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, noting that the two novels, for all their differences including the reason for the quests, are structurally similar.

=== Gain and loss ===

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the lonely mountain is a symbol of adventure, and the &quot;true end&quot; of the story is the moment when Bilbo looks back from a high pass and sees &quot;There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight. On its highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale. &#x27;So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!&#x27; said Bilbo, and he turned his back on his adventure.&quot;

Amelia Harper, in the &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that the mountain&#x27;s history, as usual for the Dwarves, was a tale of &quot;beauty gained and lives lost&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;The Lonely Mountain: Lair of Smaug the Dragon&quot; is a board game produced in 1985 by Iron Crown Enterprises, designed by Coleman Charlton, which features groups of adventurers, either Dwarves, Elves, Orcs or Men entering Smaug&#x27;s Lair to capture his treasure before he awakens.

&quot;Erebor&quot;, specifically the southern spurs of the Mountain and Dale, is a playable map in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II&quot;. It has three gates, including the one Tolkien described and two which cannot be closed, to allow those playing as invading forces to easily enter the stronghold.

The Lonely Mountain appears in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptations of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;: &quot;An Unexpected Journey&quot;, &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, and &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;. The actual setting was Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand.

<text>A drag queen is a person, usually male, who uses drag clothing and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles for entertainment purposes. Historically, drag queens have usually been gay men, and have been a part of gay culture.

People do drag for reasons ranging from self-expression to mainstream performance. Drag shows frequently include lip-syncing, live singing, and dancing. They typically occur at LGBTQ pride parades, drag pageants, cabarets, carnivals, and nightclubs. Drag queens vary by type, culture, and dedication, from professionals who star in films and spend a lot of their time in their drag personas, to people who do drag only occasionally. Women who dress as men and entertain by imitating them are called drag kings.

Those who do occasional drag may be from other backgrounds than the LGBT community. There is a long history of folkloric and theatrical crossdressing that involves people of all orientations. Not everyone who does drag at some point in their lives is a drag queen or a drag king.

==Terminology, scope, and etymology==
===Drag===

The term &quot;drag&quot; has evolved over time. Traditional definitions of the term drag utilized a gender binary which used a sex-based definition of drag where a person would be considered &quot;in drag&quot; if they were wearing the clothes of the opposite sex for the purposes of entertainment. However, with new paradigms of gender identity and the embrace of non-binary gender, newer definitions of drag have abandoned this binary framework in favor of defining drag as an art form of gender performance which is not limited to a binary framework but which must engage with and critique conceptions of gender in some fashion. This could include explorations with heightened forms of masculinity or femininity, as well as playing with other forms of gender identity.

Unlike female impersonation, the term drag is closely associated with queer identity. This close association between the term drag and the LGBTQ community began in the United States in the 1920s with the Pansy Craze when the first gay bars in America were established by the mafia during the Prohibition Era and drag entertainers became a popular form of entertainment at these underground gay speakeasies. Before this point, the term drag was not necessarily associated with gay culture, but after this point forward drag became &quot;inextricably tied to the queer community&quot;.

Traditionally, drag involves cross-dressing and transforming ones sex through the use of makeup and other costume devices. However, under newer conceptions of drag, conceivably performing an exaggerated and heightened form of one&#x27;s own gender could be considered a drag performance. While drag is often viewed as a performance based art form and a type of entertainment, it is possible to engage with drag as an art form outside of performance or for purposes other than entertainment. Drag has been used within studio art such as photography, political activism, and fashion to name a few applications outside of performance.

The origin of the term &quot;drag&quot; is uncertain. The first recorded use of &quot;drag&quot; in reference to actors dressed in women&#x27;s clothing is from 1870. It may have been based on the term &quot;grand rag&quot; which was historically used for a masquerade ball.

===Female impersonator===

The term &quot;female impersonation&quot; refers to a type of theatrical performance where a man dresses in women&#x27;s clothing for the sole purpose of entertaining an audience. The term &quot;female impersonator&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with drag queen, although they are not the same. For example, in 1972, Esther Newton described a female impersonator as a &quot;professional drag queen&quot;. She considered the term &quot;female impersonator&quot; to be the one that was (then) widely understood by heterosexual audiences. However, feminist and queer studies scholar Sarah French defined a clear separation between these two terms. She defined drag as an art form associated with queer identity whereas female impersonation comes from a wide a range of gender identity paradigms, including heteronormativity. Additionally, many drag artists view drag as a lived form of self-expression or creativity, and perceive drag as something that is not limited to the stage or to performance. In contrast, female impersonation is specifically limited to performance and may or may not involve an LGBTQI point of view.

Female impersonation can be traced back at least as far as ancient Greece. There was little to no gender equity then and women held a lower social status. This meant male actors would play female roles during theatrical performances. This tradition continued for centuries but began to be less prevalent as motion pictures became popular. During the era of vaudeville it was considered immodest for women to appear on stage. Due to that circumstance, some men became famous as &quot;female impersonators&quot;, the most notable being Julian Eltinge. At the peak of his career he was one of the most sought after and highest paid actors in the world. Andrew Tribble was another early female impersonator who gained fame on Broadway and in Black Vaudeville.

In the twentieth century some gender impersonators, both female and male, in the United States became highly successful performing artists in non-LGBTQ nightclubs and theaters. There was a concerted effort by these working female and male impersonators in America, to separate the art of gender impersonation from queer identity with an overt representation of working gender impersonators as heterosexual. Some of the performers were in fact cisgender heterosexual men and women, but others were closeted LGBTQI individuals due to the politics and social environment of the period. It was criminal in many American cities to be homosexual, or for LGBTQI people to congregate, and it was therefore necessary for female and male impersonators to distance themselves from identifying as queer publicly in order to avoid criminal charges and loss of career. The need to hide and dissociate from queer identity was prevalent among gender impersonators working in non-LGBTQ nightclubs before heteronormative audiences as late as the 1970s.

Female impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen José Sarria to hand out labels to his friends reading, &quot;I am a boy&quot;, so they could not be accused of female impersonation. American drag queen RuPaul once said, &quot;I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?&quot; He also said, &quot;I don&#x27;t dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!&quot;

===Drag queens and kings===
The meaning of the term &quot;drag queen&quot; has changed across time. The term first emerged in New York City in the 1950s, and initially had two meanings. The first meaning referred to an amateur performer who did not make a living in drag but may have participated in amateur public performances such as those held at a drag ball or a drag pageant. This was meant to draw a line differentiating amateurs performing in drag for fun from professional female impersonators who made a living performing in drag.

The second original meaning of drag queen was applied to men who chose to wear women&#x27;s clothing on the streets, an act which was at that time illegal in New York City. Of this latter type two additional slang terms were applied: &quot;square drag queens&quot; which meant &quot;boys who looked like girls but who you knew were boys&quot; and &quot;street queens&quot; who were queer male sex workers, often homeless, that dressed as women. This second use of the term was also layered with transphobic subtext and the term drag queen was again meant to protect the professional female impersonator by allowing them to dissociate themselves from both aspects of queer culture and from sex workers in order to maintain respectability among the predominantly heteronormative audiences who employed them. This understanding of the term drag queen persisted through the 1960s.

In 1971, an article in Lee Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Drag Queens&quot; magazine described a drag queen as a &quot;homosexual transvestite&quot; who is hyperfeminine, flamboyant, and militant. Drag queens were further described as having an attitude of superiority, and commonly courted by heterosexual men who would &quot;not ordinarily participate in homosexual relationships&quot;. While the term &quot;drag queen&quot; implied &quot;homosexual transvestite&quot;, the term &quot;drag&quot; carried no such connotations.

In the 1970s, &quot;drag queen&quot; was continually defined as a &quot;homosexual transvestite&quot;. &quot;Drag&quot; was parsed as changing one&#x27;s clothes to those of a different sex, while &quot;queen&quot; was said to refer to a homosexual man.

For much of history, drag queens were men, but in more modern times, cisgender and trans women, as well as non-binary people, also perform as drag queens. In a 2018 article, &quot;Psychology Today&quot; stated that drag queens are &quot;most typically gay cisgender men (though there are many drag queens of varying sexual orientations and gender identities)&quot;.

Examples of trans-feminine drag queens, sometimes called &quot;trans queens&quot;, include Monica Beverly Hillz and Peppermint. Cisgender female drag queens are sometimes called &quot;faux queens&quot; or &quot;bioqueens&quot;, though critics of this practice assert that &quot;faux&quot; carries the connotation that the drag is fake, and that the use of &quot;bioqueen&quot; exclusively for cisgender females is a misnomer since trans-feminine queens exhibit gynomorphic features.

Drag queens&#x27; counterparts are drag kings: performers, usually women, who dress in exaggeratedly masculine clothing. Examples of drag kings include Landon Cider. Trans men who dress like drag kings are sometimes termed trans kings.

===Alternative terms===

Some drag queens may prefer to be referred to as &quot;she&quot; while in drag and desire to stay completely in character. Other drag performers are indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to them. RuPaul has said, &quot;You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don&#x27;t care! Just so long as you call me.&quot;

Drag queens are sometimes called transvestites, although that term also has many other connotations than the term &quot;drag queen&quot; and is not much favored by many drag queens themselves. The term &quot;tranny,&quot; an abbreviation of the term transvestite, has been adopted by some drag performers, notably RuPaul, and the gay male community in the United States, but it is considered offensive to most transgender and transsexual people.

Many drag performers refer to themselves as drag artists, as opposed to drag queens, as some contemporary forms of drag have become nonbinary. In Brazil, androgynous drag performers are sometimes called &quot;drag queer&quot;, as a form of gender neutrality.

Among drag queens and their contacts today, there is an ongoing debate about whether transgender drag queens are actually considered &quot;drag queens&quot;. Some argue that, because a drag queen is defined as a man portraying a woman, transgender women cannot be drag queens. Drag kings are women who assume a masculine aesthetic, but this is not always the case, because there are also biokings, bioqueens, and female queens, which are people who perform their own biological sex through a heightened or exaggerated gender presentation.

== History of drag==
=== Canada ===
In the 1940s John Herbert, who sometimes competed in drag pageants, was the victim of an attempted robbery while he was dressed as a woman. His assailants falsely claimed that Herbert had solicited them for sex, and Herbert was accused and convicted of indecency under Canada&#x27;s same-sex sexual activity law (which was not repealed until 1969). After being convicted, Herbert served time in a youth reformatory in Guelph, Ontario. Herbert later served another sentence for indecency at reformatory in Mimico. Herbert wrote &quot;Fortune and Men&#x27;s Eyes&quot; in 1964 based on his time behind bars. He included the character of Queenie as an authorial self-insertion.

In 1973 the first Canadian play about and starring a drag queen, &quot;Hosanna&quot; by Michel Tremblay, was performed at Théâtre de Quat&#x27;Sous in Montreal.
In 1977 the Canadian film &quot;Outrageous!&quot;, starring drag queen Craig Russell, became one of the first gay-themed films to break out into mainstream theatrical release.

=== India ===

In September 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the application of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to consensual homosexual sex between adults was unconstitutional, &quot;irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary&quot;. Since then, drag culture in India has been growing and becoming the mainstream art culture. The hotel chain of Lalit Groups spaced a franchise of clubs where drag performances are hosted in major cities of India such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore.

Maya the Drag Queen, Rani Kohinoor (Sushant Divgikar), Lush Monsoon, Betta Naan Stop, Tropical Marca, Zeeshan Ali, and Patruni Sastry are some examples of Indian drag artists. In 2018, Hyderabad had its first drag convention. In 2020, India&#x27;s first drag specific magazine Dragvanti began publication.

===Lebanon===
Lebanon is the only country in the Arab world with an increasingly visible drag scene. Drag culture has existed in Lebanon for several decades but gained popularity with the astronomical rise of Bassem Feghali, who came to prominence in the 1990s, becoming a household name for his impersonation of Lebanese female singers. Due to the global success of Rupaul&#x27;s Drag Race, Beirut&#x27;s drag scene has adopted various influences that blend American drag culture with local, unique cultural elements. The drag scene has grown so much that in 2019 &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine declared it a drag-aissance.

=== Paraguay ===
Usha Didi Gunatita was a pioneer of drag art during the later years of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. Many drag queens of later generations claim her as a reference, and base their characters on Usha&#x27;s exaggerated characteristics in her performances. She is also remembered as one of the first trans people who was featured on Paraguayan television without being censored.

=== Philippines ===
Before being colonized by Spain in the mid-1500s, it was a national custom for men to dress in women&#x27;s clothing. However, when the Spaniards arrived, they not only outlawed homosexuality but executed men that appeared to be homosexual. Spain cast a culture of Machismo onto the Philippines, causing any kind of queerness and queer culture to be heavily suppressed.

Nonetheless, in the early 1900s drag started to reappear in the media. Drag became a key element of national pantomime theatre and as time went on, drag queens appeared in other forms of theatre and in movies.

=== South Africa ===
Drag in South Africa emerged in the 1950s in major cities such as Johannesburg and Cape Town. It started in the form of underground pageants which created a safe space for members of the LGBTQ+ community in Apartheid South Africa, where people could be punished by law for being gay. Being gay was not legalized in South Africa until 1998, so pageants, such as the famous Miss Gay Western Cape, did not become official until the late 1990s.

Discrimination against drag is widespread in South Africa, and drag queens face the threat of violence by being openly gay. Furthermore, there is not language to explore queerness in Xhosa, one of the indigenous languages of South Africa.

=== Thailand ===
After homosexual acts were decriminalized in Thailand in 1956, gay clubs and other queer spaces began opening which lead to the first cabaret. However, drag in Thailand was actually heavily influenced by drag queens from the Philippines as the first drag show started after the owner of a gay club saw drag queens from the Philippines perform in Bangkok. Therefore, drag shows started in Thailand in the mid-1970s and have become increasingly popular over time, especially in major cities like Bangkok.

=== United Kingdom ===
In Renaissance England, women were forbidden from performing on stage, so female roles were played by men or boys. The practice continued, as a tradition, when pantomimes became a popular form of entertainment in Europe during the late 1800s to the mid-1900s. The dame became a stock character with a range of attitudes from &quot;charwoman&quot; to &quot;grande dame&quot; who was mainly used for improvisation. A notable, and highly successful, pantomime dame from this period was Dan Leno.

Beyond theatre, in the 1800s, Molly houses became a place for gay men to meet, often dressed in drag. Despite homosexuality being outlawed, men would dress in women&#x27;s clothing and attend these taverns and coffee houses to congregate and meet other, mostly gay, men.

By the mid-1900s, pantomime, and the use of pantomime dames, had declined, although it remains a popular Christmas tradition. The role of the dame, however, evolved to become more about the individual performer. Many female impersonators built up their own fan bases, and began performing outside of their traditional pantomime roles.

=== United States ===
====Origins====

Drag performance in the United States had its roots in the female impersonations of performers in minstrel shows of the 19th century, followed by female impersonators working in vaudeville, burlesque, and the legitimate theatre in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

The Pansy Craze was a period of increased LGBT visibility in American popular culture from the late-1920s until the mid-1930s; during the &quot;craze,&quot; drag queens — known as &quot;pansy performers&quot; — experienced a surge in underground popularity, especially in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The exact dates of the movement are debated, with a range from the late 1920s until 1935.

The term &quot;pansy craze&quot; was coined by the historian George Chauncey in his 1994 book &quot;Gay New York&quot;.

==== First drag balls ====
The first person known to describe himself as &quot;the queen of drag&quot; was William Dorsey Swann, born enslaved in Hancock, Maryland, who in the 1880s started hosting drag balls in Washington, DC attended by other men who were formerly enslaved. The balls were often raided by the police, as documented in the newspapers. In 1896, Swann was convicted and sentenced to 10 months in jail on the false charge of &quot;keeping a disorderly house&quot; (a euphemism for running a brothel). He requested a pardon from President Grover Cleveland, but was denied.

==== Night clubs ====
In the early to mid-1900s, female impersonation had become tied to the LGBT community and thus criminality, so it had to change forms and locations. It moved from being popular mainstream entertainment to something done only at night in disreputable areas, such as San Francisco&#x27;s Tenderloin. Here female impersonation started to evolve into what we today know as drag and drag queens. Drag queens such as José Sarria first came to prominence in these clubs. People went to these nightclubs to play with the boundaries of gender and sexuality and it became a place for the LGBT community, especially gay men, to feel accepted.

As LGBT culture has slowly become more accepted in American society, drag has also become more, though not totally, acceptable in today&#x27;s society. In the 1940s and 1950s, Arthur Blake was one of the few female impersonators to be successful in both gay and mainstream entertainment, becoming famous for his impersonations of Bette Davis, Carmen Miranda, and Eleanor Roosevelt in night clubs. At the invitation of the Roosevelts, he performed his impersonation of Eleanor at the White House. He impersonated Davis and Miranda in the 1952 film &quot;Diplomatic Courier&quot;.

==== Protests ====
The Cooper Donuts Riot was a May 1959 incident in Los Angeles in which drag queens, lesbians, transgender women, and gay men rioted; it was one of the first LGBT protests in the United States.

The Compton&#x27;s Cafeteria riot, which involved drag queens and others, occurred in San Francisco in 1966. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.

On 17 March 1968, in Los Angeles, to protest entrapment and harassment by the Los Angeles Police Department, two drag queens known as &quot;The Princess&quot; and &quot;The Duchess&quot; held a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day party at Griffith Park, a popular cruising spot and a frequent target of police activity. More than 200 gay men socialized through the day.

Drag queens were also involved in the Stonewall riots, a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the LGBT community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of 28 June 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The riots are widely considered to be the catalyst for the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.

During the summer of 1976, a restaurant in Fire Island Pines, New York, denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren&#x27;s friends in Cherry Grove heard what had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on 4 July 1976, sailed to the Pines by water taxi. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to the Pines, called the Invasion of the Pines.

==== Politics ====
In 1961, drag queen José Sarria ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States.

In 1991, drag queen Terence Alan Smith, as Joan Jett Blakk, ran against Richard M. Daley for the office of mayor of Chicago, Illinois. The campaign was chronicled in the 1991 video &quot;Drag in for Votes&quot;. After qualifying for presidency on his 35th birthday, Smith announced a campaign for presidency in 1992 under the slogan &quot;Lick Bush in &#x27;92!&quot; and documented in the 1993 video of the same name. Smith also ran for president in 1996 with the slogan &quot;Lick Slick Willie in &#x27;96!&quot; In each of these campaigns Smith ran on the Queer Nation Party ticket. In June 2019, a play based on Smith&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign, titled &quot;Ms. Blakk for President,&quot; written by Tarell Alvin McCraney and Tina Landau and starring McCraney in the title role, opened at Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago.

In 2019, Maebe A. Girl became the first drag queen elected to public office in the United States when she was elected to the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council.

==== Other ====
D&#x27;Arcy Drollinger was appointed San Francisco&#x27;s first drag laureate in May 2023. The role consists of serving as an ambassador for San Francisco&#x27;s LGBTQ+, arts, nightlife, and entertainment communities.

Pickle Drag Queen became West Hollywood&#x27;s first drag laureate on International Drag Day, 16 July 2023.

== Drag families ==

Drag families are a part of ball culture and drag houses&quot;.&quot;

=== Drag mother ===
A drag queen may either pick a drag name, or be given it by a friend or a &quot;drag mother&quot;. Drag mothers often come to lead their drag house, or start their own, and are more experienced and acclaimed members of the drag community. As such, drag mothers and drag daughters have a mentor-apprentice relationship. This is because drag mothers help hone the skills of their younger queens, or drag daughters, by teaching them things such as how to apply makeup, walk in heels, sew clothing, dance, sing etc. In addition to this, drag mothers also promote their drag children at events and performances.

== Art of drag ==

The process of getting into drag or into character can take hours. A drag queen may aim for a certain style, celebrity impression, or message with their look. Hair, make-up, and costumes are the most important essentials for drag queens. Drag queens tend to go for a more exaggerated look with a lot more makeup than a typical woman would wear.

Some people do drag simply as a means of self-expression, but often drag queens (once they have completed a look) will go out to clubs and bars and perform in a &quot;drag show&quot;. Many drag queens dress up for money by doing different shows, but there are also drag queens that have full-time jobs but still enjoy dressing up in drag as a hobby.

Many parts of the drag show, and of the drag queens&#x27; other intellectual properties, cannot be protected by intellectual property law. To substitute the lack of legal protection, drag queens revert to social norms in order to protect their intellectual property.

== In entertainment ==
=== Drag shows and venues ===
A drag show is a piece of entertainment consisting of a variety of songs, monologues or skits featuring either single performers or groups of performers in drag meant to entertain an audience. They range from amateur performances at small bars to elaborately staged theatrical presentations. Many drag shows feature performers singing or lip-synching to songs while performing a pre-planned pantomime, or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous female singers or personalities. Some events are centered around drag, such as Southern Decadence where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally drag queens.

In 2020 the first West End play to feature an all drag cast, &quot;Death Drop,&quot; launched at the Garrick Theatre in London. Produced by Tuckshop and Trafalgar Entertainment it was written by drag performer Holly Stars and starred Courtney Act, Monet X Change, Latrice Royale, Willam, Holly Stars, Anna Phylactic, LoUis CYfer, Don One, Kemah Bob, Myra Dubois and Vinegar Strokes and was directed by Jesse Jones. The show ran for a number of weeks in November and December 2020 before being closed due to a COVID lockdown in London. The show reopened on 19 May 2021 and ran until its scheduled end date of 11 July 2021. &quot;Death Drop&quot; received 5-star reviews from many publications including Gay Times and Attitude magazine and was widely celebrated for breaking new ground in theatrical drag performance.

=== In music ===

While some male music celebrities wear exaggerated feminine clothing as part of their show, they are not necessarily drag queens. An example of a band that utilised drag as part of their stage act was the New York Dolls. Similarly, English new wave singer Boy George wears drag queen style clothes and cosmetics but he once stated he was not a drag queen. However, RuPaul is a professional drag queen performer and singer.

Examples of songs where lyrics refer to drag queens:
* &quot;Lola&quot; by The Kinks (or possibly a transgender woman)
* &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot; by Aerosmith
* &quot;The Lady Is a Vamp&quot; by Spice Girls
* &quot;Ballad of Cleo and Joe&quot; by Cyndi Lauper
* &quot;King for a Day&quot; by Green Day
* &quot;Cherry Lips&quot; by Garbage
* &quot;Born This Way&quot; by Lady Gaga
* &quot;Verbatim&quot; by Mother Mother
* &quot;He&#x27;s a Woman, She&#x27;s a Man&quot; by Scorpions
* &quot;Pretty Lady&quot; by Ke$ha &amp; Detox Icunt
* &quot;Andrew in Drag&quot; by The Magnetic Fields

=== In television ===

Drag queen Don McLean (drag name Lori Shannon) appeared in three episodes of the CBS sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot; as drag queen Beverly LaSalle: &quot;Archie the Hero&quot; (1975), in which Archie Bunker gives her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, not realizing she is male; &quot;Beverly Rides Again&quot; (1976), in which Archie uses her to play a practical joke on a friend; and &quot;Edith&#x27;s Crisis of Faith, Part 1&quot; (1977), in which her murder leads Edith Bunker to question her faith in God. The role was noteworthy for its uncommonly respectful and sympathetic treatment of Beverly as a &quot;transvestite&quot;.

British entertainer Paul O&#x27;Grady was a staple of light entertainment and variety shows on UK television from the early 80s to the mid 90s playing the drag persona Lily Savage: an over the top, glamorous diva character for comedic effect.

&quot;CODCO&quot; was a Canadian sketch comedy series which aired on CBC Television from 1988 to 1993; two of its actors, Tommy Sexton and Greg Malone, were especially renowned for drag-based impersonations of celebrity women such as Queen Elizabeth, Barbara Frum, Barbara Walters, Tammy Faye Bakker and Margaret Thatcher. In one famous sketch, Malone as Frum moderated a debate between Andy Jones as a gay teacher who had been fired from his job for testing HIV-positive and Sexton as Clarabelle Otterhead, the president of an anti-gay lobby group called Citizens Outraged by Weird Sex (or COWS).

Drag queen Amnesia Sparkles tried out for &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2002.

&quot;What Would You Do?&quot;, airing since early 2008, has had episodes featuring drag queens.

In mid-2008, RuPaul began producing &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, a reality television game show which began airing in February 2009. The premise of the program has several drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as &quot;America&#x27;s next drag superstar&quot;. It inspired the similar spin-off shows &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag U&quot; and &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race: All Stars&quot;, as well as the international franchise editions &quot;Drag Race Thailand&quot;, &quot;The Switch Drag Race&quot; (Chile), &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK&quot;, &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, &quot;Drag Race Holland&quot;, &quot;Drag Race España&quot;, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race Down Under&quot;, &quot;Drag Race France&quot;, &quot;Drag Race Philippines&quot; among many others.

In 2018, &quot;American Idol&quot; featured a drag queen, Adam Sanders (drag name Ada Vox) as one of its contestants. He made it to the top ten.

In 2018, &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; featured Queen Shane Jenek (drag name Courtney Act) as one of its contestants, placing first in the season with 49.43% of the public vote.

The Netflix show &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, also released in 2018, starred Justin Johnson (drag name Alyssa Edwards) and his dance studio, Beyond Belief Dance Company.

A 2018 episode of &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; titled &quot;Werking Mom&quot;, featured many drag queens, including cameos from RuPaul and Raja (the season three winner of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;).

Gingzilla, also known as Ben Hudson and the &quot;Glamonster&quot;, an Australian drag queen, appeared on &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2018, and &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in 2019.

On 15 January 2020, TLC announced that it had given a full season run to &quot;Dragnificent!&quot;, a new show to be based on the &quot;Drag Me Down the Aisle&quot; special. The series premiered on 19 April 2020.
The Netflix show &quot;AJ and the Queen&quot;, released in 2020, followed &quot;Ruby Red, a bigger-than-life but down-on-her-luck drag queen [played by RuPaul] who travels across America from club to club in a rundown 1990s R/V with her unlikely sidekick AJ, a recently orphaned, tough-talking, scrappy ten-year-old stowaway. As the two misfits travel from city to city, Ruby&#x27;s message of love and acceptance winds up touching people and changing their lives for the better.&quot;
In 2020 RuPaul became the first drag queen to host &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; though he was not in drag at the time.

== In education ==

While drag queens are entertainers, they play a role in educating people on gender roles and stereotyping. Professor Stephen Schacht of Plattsburgh State University of New York began introducing his and his students&#x27; experiences of attending a drag show to his gender/sexualities class to challenge his students&#x27; ideas of dichotomy. Over time he began inviting students to attend with him. He gathered from his students that after attending the drag show they had a new appreciation for gender and sexuality and often become very vocal about their new experiences in the classroom.

=== With children ===
Nina West, &quot;Drag Race&quot; season eleven contestant and winner of &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;, and producer of &quot;Drag Is Magic&quot;, an EP of children&#x27;s music about the art form, says she hopes to inspire them to &quot;dream big, be kind, and be their perfect selves.&quot; West feels the art form is &quot;an opportunity for children to get creative and think outside the boxes us silly adults have crafted for them.&quot; Marti Gould Cummings said something similar when a video of them performing &quot;Baby Shark&quot; at a drag brunch event went viral. &quot;Anyone who thinks drag isn&#x27;t for children is wrong,&quot; said Cummings, &quot;Drag is expression, and children are such judgment-free beings; they don&#x27;t really care what you&#x27;re wearing, just what you&#x27;re performing.&quot; As of May 2019, the video has been viewed over 806,000 times.

West responded to critics who question if children are too young to experience drag, saying &quot;Drag is an opportunity for anyone – including and especially children – to reconsider the masks we are all forced to wear daily.&quot; West added, &quot;Children are inundated with implicit imagery from media about what is &#x27;boy&#x27; and what is &#x27;girl.&#x27; And I believe that almost all kids are really less concerned about playing with a toy that&#x27;s supposedly aligned to their gender, and more concerned with playing with toys that speak to them.&quot;

John Casey, an adjunct professor at Wagner College in New York City, posits in &quot;The Advocate&quot;,

Separately from kids watching drag, the phenomena of drag kids is relatively recent, &quot;The New York Times&quot; in September 2019 published a guess that a there are about a hundred children who do drag in the U.S., with Desmond is Amazing being the one with the most followers. The mainstream access to drag queens on television exponentially increased in 2009 when &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; started airing.

However, as of 2022, exposing kids to drag has become somewhat controversial. Lawmakers in states such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas are attempting to ban minors from attending drag shows and punish parents who expose their kids to drag. These attempts to ban minors from watching drag are based on allegations of drag being a form of perversion and hyper-sexualization. Some have argued that these accusations are the same that were leveled against homosexual men since the lavender scare of the 1950s. Those who disagree with the accusations have argued that drag queens provide a safe and creative environment for young children, especially LGBTQ+ children, and are a source of both education and entertainment.

==== Story time in libraries ====
In December 2015, Radar Productions and Michelle Tea developed the concept of Drag Queen Story Hour. Launched at the San Francisco Public Library, Drag Queen Story Hour was adopted by the Brooklyn Public Library in the summer of 2016, and has since traveled to various libraries, museums, bookstores, recreation centers, and parks across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

Such events sometimes prompt opposition against the libraries and organizers. In one instance in California, men belonging to the far-right group known as the Proud Boys arrived in a group and disrupted the event by shouting homophobic and transphobic phrases at the crowd. The County Sheriff&#x27;s Office opened a hate crime investigation into the incident due to the nature of the disruption. Proud Boys sometimes bring guns for intimidation purposes. Some leftist groups, such as the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, organize armed counter protests to keep protesters out of the building. This usually leads to the presence of police to ensure both groups don&#x27;t harm each other.

== Societal reception ==
Drag has come to be a celebrated and important aspect of modern gay life, but has also been criticized for degrading women. In the era of second-wave feminism some women &quot;were angry and appalled by what they perceived as the charade of femininity expressed by some drag queens and transsexual women.&quot; These critics compared drag to blackface and saw it &quot;as a kind of gender minstrel.&quot;

Many gay bars and clubs around the world hold drag shows as regular events or for special parties. Several &quot;International Drag Day&quot; holidays have been started over the years to promote the shows. In the United States, Drag Day is typically celebrated in early March.

A televised drag competition, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, is the most successful program on the Logo television network. In 2016, the show won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. In 2018, the show became the first show to win a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program in the same year.

RuPaul received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry on 16 March 2018, making him the first drag queen to be given such an award.

=== Moral panic ===
A moral panic called drag panic has emerged in the United States in relation to drag queen performers. It alleges that contact between children and drag queens would involve drag queens attempting to molest them or indoctrinate them into the &quot;queer way of life&quot;. This moral panic has also been linked to the LGBT grooming conspiracy theory, also from the United States.

<text>A pride parade (also known as pride event, pride festival, pride march, or pride protest) is an event celebrating lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) social and self-acceptance, achievements, legal rights, and pride. The events sometimes also serve as demonstrations for legal rights such as same-sex marriage. Most occur annually throughout the Western world, while some take place every June to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, which was a pivotal moment in modern LGBTQ social movements. The parades seek to create community and honor the history of the movement.
In 1970, pride and protest marches were held in Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco around the first anniversary of Stonewall. The events became annual and grew internationally. In 2019, New York and the world celebrated the largest international Pride celebration in history: Stonewall 50 - WorldPride NYC 2019, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, with five million attending in Manhattan alone. Pride parades occur in urban locations worldwide, incl. cities or urban areas in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Israel, Japan, Mexico and the United States.
==Background==

In the 1960s and 1970s a surge of public demonstrations in the US focused on civil rights, anti-war movements, and early LGBTQ+ rights activism. One of the first demonstrations for the cause of gay and lesbian rights was a 1965 &quot;homophile march&quot; by the Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis outside the White House, highlighting discrimination in federal employment and advancing LGBTQ+ equality.

Also in 1965, the gay rights protest movement was visible at the Annual Reminder pickets, again organized by members of the lesbian group Daughters of Bilitis, and the gay men&#x27;s group Mattachine Society. Mattachine members were also involved in demonstrations in support of homosexuals imprisoned in Cuban labor camps. Early on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, LGBTQ people rioted following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. The Stonewall Inn was a gay bar which catered to an assortment of patrons, but which was popular with the most marginalized people in the gay community: transvestites, transgender people, effeminate young men, hustlers, and homeless youth.

==First pride marches==

As the movement became more radical in the late 1960s, particularly after the Stonewall Uprising, they were called Gay Liberation or Gay Freedom marches which emphasized demands for full equality and liberation.

On Saturday, June 27, 1970, the Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march from Washington Square Park (&quot;Bughouse Square&quot;) to the Water Tower at the intersection of Michigan and Chicago avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants spontaneously marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza. The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers.

The West Coast of the United States saw a march in San Francisco on June 27, 1970, and &#x27;Gay-in&#x27; on June 28, 1970 and a march in Los Angeles on June 28, 1970. In Los Angeles, Morris Kight (Gay Liberation Front LA founder), Reverend Troy Perry (Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches founder) and Reverend Bob Humphries (United States Mission founder) gathered to plan a commemoration. They settled on a parade down Hollywood Boulevard. But securing a permit from the city was no easy task. They named their organization Christopher Street West, &quot;as ambiguous as we could be.&quot; But Rev. Perry recalled the Los Angeles Police Chief Edward M. Davis telling him, &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, granting a permit to a group of homosexuals to parade down Hollywood Boulevard would be the same as giving a permit to a group of thieves and robbers.&quot; Grudgingly, the Police Commission granted the permit, though there were fees exceeding $1.5 million. After the American Civil Liberties Union stepped in, the commission dropped all its requirements but a $1,500 fee for police service. That, too, was dismissed when the California Superior Court ordered the police to provide protection as they would for any other group. The eleventh-hour California Supreme Court decision ordered the police commissioner to issue a parade permit citing the &quot;constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.&quot; From the beginning, L.A. parade organizers and participants knew there were risks of violence. Kight received death threats right up to the morning of the parade. Unlike later editions, the first gay parade was very quiet. The marchers convened on Mccadden Place in Hollywood, marched north and turned east onto Hollywood Boulevard. &quot;The Advocate&quot; reported &quot;Over 1,000 homosexuals and their friends staged, not just a protest march, but a full-blown parade down world-famous Hollywood Boulevard.&quot;

On Sunday, June 28, 1970, at around noon, in New York gay activist groups held their own pride parade, known as the Christopher Street Liberation Day, to recall the events of Stonewall one year earlier. On November 2, 1969, Craig Rodwell, his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, and Linda Rhodes proposed the first gay pride parade to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in Philadelphia.

All attendees to the ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia voted for the march except for the Mattachine Society of New York City, which abstained. Members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) attended the meeting and were seated as guests of Rodwell&#x27;s group, Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods (HYMN).

Meetings to organize the march began in early January at Rodwell&#x27;s apartment in 350 Bleecker Street. At first there was difficulty getting some of the major New York organizations like Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) to send representatives. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, Michael Brown, Marty Nixon, and Foster Gunnison of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization. Other mainstays of the GLF organizing committee were Judy Miller, Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie and Brenda Howard. Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970. With Dick Leitsch&#x27;s replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended.

The first marches were both serious and fun and served to inspire the widening LGBT movement; they were repeated in the following years and more and more annual marches started up in other cities throughout the world. In Atlanta and New York City the marches were called &quot;Gay Liberation Marches&quot;, and the day of celebration was called &quot;Gay Liberation Day&quot;; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as &#x27;Gay Freedom Marches&#x27; and the day was called &quot;Gay Freedom Day&quot;. As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem heteronormative and &#x27;straight&#x27;, and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this queer culture into the space. The marches spread internationally, including to London where the first &quot;gay pride rally&quot; took place on 1 July 1972, the date chosen deliberately to mark the third anniversary of the Stonewall riots.
In the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities, and they dropped &quot;Gay Liberation&quot; and &quot;Gay Freedom&quot; from the names, replacing them with &quot;Gay Pride&quot;. The term &quot;Gay Pride&quot; was claimed to be coined either by Jack Baker and Michael McConnell, an activist couple in Minnesota, or by Thom Higgins, another gay rights activist in Minnesota.

The Middle East had its first pride march in 1979 in Israel. The pride march has grown to over 250,000 participants by 2019. In 2017, the first pride march week in the Middle East was established in Lebanon.

The oldest LGBT community center in South Florida Pridelines has been a partner of Miami Beach Pride for more than a decade.
In Southeast Asia, the first pride march was celebrated on June 26, 1994, when 30-50 individuals marched in Quezon City in the Philippines. Less than three decades later, the government rejected an equality legislation, sparking the largest pride march in Southeast Asia, where over 110,000 people in 2023 marched in Quezon City in support of the SOGIE Equality Bill.
East Asia saw its first pride march on August 28, 1994, when a march was held in Tokyo in Japan. The largest ever pride march in the region was held in 2022 when over 120,000 people marched in Taiwan to support equal rights.

The first pride march in South Asia was held on July 2, 1999, in the city of Kolkata in India. Central Asia&#x27;s first pride march was held on May 8, 2019, in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.

==Description==
Many parades still have at least some of the original political or activist character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even Mardi Gras-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, drag queens and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as Metropolitan Community Churches, United Church of Christ, and Unitarian Universalist Churches, PFLAG, and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.

Even the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of AIDS and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and corporate sponsors and promoted as major tourist attractions for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The &#x27;dividing line&#x27; between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.

Though the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named &quot;Gay&quot;, the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the &#x27;queer&#x27; or LGBT community.

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, as many of the actual participants had grown older, moved on to other issues, or died, this passage of time led to misunderstandings as to who had actually participated in the Stonewall riots, who had actually organized the subsequent demonstrations, marches and memorials, and who had been members of early activist organizations such as Gay Liberation Front and Gay Activists Alliance. The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events. Changing first to &quot;Lesbian and Gay&quot;, today most are called &quot;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender&quot; (LGBT) or simply &quot;Pride&quot;. Pride parades are held in many urban areas and in many countries where the urbanization rate is at least 80%.

==Pride events by country==


===Africa===
====Malawi====
On 26 June 2021, a community of the LGBT community in Malawi held its first Pride Parade. The parade was held in the country&#x27;s capital city, Lilongwe.

====Mauritius====
As of June 2006, the Rainbow Parade Mauritius is held every June in Mauritius in the town of Rose Hill. It is organized by the Collective Arc-En-Ciel, a local non-governmental LGBTI rights group, along with some other local non-governmental groups.

====South Africa====

The first South African pride parade was held towards the end of the apartheid era in Johannesburg on October 13, 1990, the first such event on the African continent. Section Nine of the country&#x27;s 1996 constitution provides for equality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation among other factors. The Joburg Pride organizing body disbanded in 2013 due to internal conflict about whether the event should continue to be used for political advocacy. A new committee was formed in May 2013 to organize a &quot;People&#x27;s Pride&quot;, which was &quot;envisioned as an inclusive and explicitly political movement for social justice&quot;. Other pride parades held in the Johannesburg area include Soweto Pride which takes place annually in Meadowlands, Soweto, and Ekurhuleni Pride which takes place annually in KwaThema, a township on the East Rand. Pride parades held in other South African cities include the Cape Town Pride parade and Khumbu Lani Pride in Cape Town, Durban Pride in Durban, and Nelson Mandela Bay Pride in Port Elizabeth. Limpopo Pride is held in Polokwane, Limpopo.

====Uganda====
In August 2012, the first Ugandan pride parade was held in Entebbe to protest the government&#x27;s treatment of its LGBT citizens and the attempts by the Ugandan Parliament to adopt harsher sodomy laws, colloquially named the Kill the Gays Bill, which would include life imprisonment for aggravated homosexuality. A second pride parade was held in Entebbe in August 2013. The law was promulgated in December 2013 and subsequently ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court of Uganda on August 1, 2014, on technical grounds. On August 9, 2014, Ugandans held a third pride parade in Entebbe despite indications that the ruling may be appealed and/or the law reintroduced in Parliament and homosexual acts still being illegal in the country.

===Asia===
==== East Timor ====

The first pride march in East Timor&#x27;s capital Dili was held in 2017.

====Hong Kong====
The first International Day Against Homophobia pride parade in Hong Kong was held on May 16, 2005, under the theme &quot;Turn Fear into Love&quot;, calling for acceptance and care amongst gender and sexual minorities in a diverse and friendly society.

The Hong Kong Pride Parade 2008 boosted the rally count above 1,000 in the second largest East Asian Pride after Taipei&#x27;s. By now a firmly annual event, Pride 2013 saw more than 5,200 participants. The city continues to hold the event every year, except in 2010 when it was not held due to a budget shortfall.

In the Hong Kong Pride Parade 2018, the event broke its previous record, with 12,000 participants. The police arrested a participant who violated the law of &quot;outraging public decency&quot; by wearing only his underwear in an area of the road cordoned off for the parade.

====India====

On June 29, 2008, four Indian cities (Delhi, Bangalore, Pondicherry, and Kolkata) saw coordinated pride events. About 2,200 people turned up overall. These were also the first pride events of all these cities except Kolkata, which had seen its first such event in 1999 - making it South Asia&#x27;s first pride walk and then had been organizing pride events every year since 2003 (although there was a gap of a year or so in-between). The pride parades were successful, given that no right-wing group attacked or protested against the pride parade, although the opposition party BJP expressed its disagreement with the concept of gay pride parade. The next day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for greater social tolerance towards homosexuals at an AIDS event. On August 16, 2008 (one day after the Independence Day of India), the gay community in Mumbai held its first-ever formal pride parade (although informal pride parades had been held many times earlier), to demand that India&#x27;s anti-gay laws be amended. A high court in the Indian capital, Delhi ruled on July 2, 2009, that homosexual intercourse between consenting adults was not a criminal act, although the Supreme Court later reversed its decision in 2013 under widespread pressure from powerful conservative and religious groups, leading to the re-criminalization of homosexuality in India. Pride parades have also been held in smaller Indian cities such as Nagpur, Madurai, Bhubaneshwar and Thrissur. Attendance at the pride parades has been increasing significantly since 2008, with an estimated participation of 3,500 people in Delhi and 1,500 people in Bangalore in 2010. On September 6, 2018, sex between same-sex adults was legalized by India&#x27;s Supreme Court.

=====Tripura=====

On September 12, 2022, Tripura celebrated its first &#x27;Queer Pride Walk&#x27; held in Agartala.
 The major goal of the queer pride parade is to honor and celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons, as well as to raise awareness in society so that people can break free from the stigma and biases that surround them. Swabhiman, a non-governmental organization, coordinated the Queer Pride Walk. More than seven months after four transgender people in Tripura had a harrowing experience at a police station that went viral on social media, the state&#x27;s queer community held its first-ever pride walk on Monday in Agartala, claiming the right to live in dignity and equality, free of gender discrimination, stigma, and taboo for being different. Hundreds of lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) persons marched in the colorful pride parade, waving rainbow flags and holding banners urging people to reject gender stigma and sexuality stereotypes. &#x27;Swabhiman&#x27; President Sneha Gupta Roy asserted the necessity for the state to establish a Transgender Welfare Board to protect the rights of the gay community, adding, &quot;The society must accept us as we are. We, too, are members of society and should not face discrimination. The source of societal biases, discrimination, and injustice directed at us is, surprisingly, a lack of knowledge. We, too, have the right to live with respect and dignity, and in order to do so, the Central Government must work to develop the community&#x27;s skills and create employment opportunities that will prevent members of the community from resorting to unethical means of income and thus becoming socially marginalized.&quot;

====Israel====
Tel Aviv hosts an annual pride parade, attracting more than 260,000 people, making it the largest LGBT pride event in Asia. Three Pride parades took place in Tel Aviv on the week of June 11, 2010. The main parade, which is also partly funded by the city&#x27;s municipality, was one of the largest ever to take place in Israel, with approximately 200,000 participants. The first Pride parade in Tel Aviv took place in 1993.

On June 30, 2005, the fourth annual Pride march of Jerusalem took place. The Jerusalem parade has been met with resistance due to the high presence of religious bodies in the city. It had originally been prohibited by a municipal ban which was canceled by the court. Many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem&#x27;s Muslim, Jewish, and Christian communities had arrived at a rare consensus asking the municipal government to cancel the permit of the parades.

Another parade, this time billed as an international event, was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2005, but was postponed to 2006 due to the stress on police forces during the summer of Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan. In 2006, it was again postponed due to the Israel-Hezbollah war. It was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006, caused a wave of protests by Haredi Jews around central Israel. The Israel National Police had filed a petition to cancel the parade due to foreseen strong opposition. Later, an agreement was reached to convert the parade into an assembly inside the Hebrew University stadium in Jerusalem. June 21, 2007, the Jerusalem Open House organization succeeded in staging a parade in central Jerusalem after police allocated thousands of personnel to secure the general area. The rally planned afterwards was canceled due to an unrelated national fire brigade strike which prevented proper permits from being issued. The parade was postponed once more in 2014, as a result of Protective Edge Operation.

In 2022 local environmentalists from Tel Aviv started planning how to make the current year&#x27;s parade and future parades more sustainable, using composting stations and removing single use plastic from the largest pride parade in the Middle East.

====Japan====


The first Pride Parade in Japan was held on August 28, 1994, in Tokyo (while the names were not Pride Parade until 2007). In 2005, an administrative institution, the Tokyo Pride was founded to have Pride Parade constantly every year. In May 2011, Tokyo Pride was dissolved and most of the original management went on to found Tokyo Rainbow Pride.

==== Lebanon ====
Beirut Pride is the annual non-profit LGBTIQ+ pride event and militant march held in Beirut, the capital of the Lebanon, working to decriminalize homosexuality in Lebanon. Since its inception in 2017, Beirut Pride has been the first and only LGBTIQ+ pride in the arabophone world, and its largest LGBTIQ+ event. It has been the topic of four MA theses, one post-doctoral research and six documentaries, so far covered in 17 languages in 350 articles. Its first installment gathered 4,000 persons, and 2,700 people participated in the first three days of its 2018 edition, before the police cracked it down and arrested its founder Hadi Damien. The next day, the prosecutor of Beirut suspended the scheduled activities, and initiated criminal proceedings against Hadi for organizing events &quot;that incite to debauchery&quot;. Beirut Pride holds annual events adapted to the current circumstances in the country.

====South Korea====
Queer Culture Festivals in South Korea consist of pride parades and various other LGBT events, such as film festivals. Currently there are eight Queer Culture Festivals, including Seoul Queer Culture Festival (since 2000), Daegu Queer Culture Festival (since 2009), Busan Queer Culture Festival (since 2017), Jeju Queer Culture Festival (since 2017), Jeonju Queer Culture Festival (since 2018), Gwangju Queer Culture Festival (since 2018), Incheon Queer Culture Festival (since 2018), and Daejeon Queer Culture Festival (since 2024).

====Nepal====

Nepal Pride Parade is organized on June 29 every year. There are also Pride Parades organized by Blue Diamond Society and Mitini Nepal. A youth-led pride parade which uses broader umbrella terms as Queer and MOGAI, is organized by Queer Youth Group and Queer Rights Collective. Blue Diamond Society&#x27;s rally on Gai Jatra is technically not considered as a Pride Parade. Mitini Nepal organizes Pride Parades on Feb 14 while, a Queer Womxn Pride is also organized on International Women&#x27;s Day.

====Philippines====

In 1992, the Lesbian Collective marched during the International Women&#x27;s Day celebrations, and participated in the program after negotiations with organizers.

In 1993, UP Babaylan, an LGBT student support group, participated in the University of the Philippines Diliman&#x27;s Lantern Parade. Thanks to the positive reception from this march, members of UP Babaylan would participate in future Lantern Parades.

On June 26, 1994, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Progressive Organization of Gays in the Philippines (Pro Gay Philippines) and Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) Manila organized the first LGBT Pride March in Philippines, marching from EDSA corner Quezon Avenue to Quezon City Memorial Circle (Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines) and highlighting broad social issues. At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.

In 1995, Pro Gay Philippines and MCC did not lead a pride parade. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reach Out AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. These pride parades were organized a celebration of gay pride, but also were parading to raise awareness for discrimination and the misinformation surrounding AIDS.

In 1999, Reach Out Aids Foundation handed its organization to a newly formed Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community. In 2003, the Pride March was moved from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10). TFP organized the pride parades for two decades before the Metro Manila Pride organization assumed the responsibility in 2016.

On December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme &quot;CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights&quot; was held along the streets of España and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.

In 2007, the first transgender women&#x27;s group participated in the Metro Manila Pride March.

On December 6, 2014, Philippines celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Metro Manila Pride March with the theme: Come Out for Love &quot;Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin&quot; (Come Out for Love Because It&#x27;s Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.

====Singapore====
A pride parade known as Pink Dot SG has been held in Singapore since 2009 with increasing attendance amounting to the tens of thousands. There are often held in either June or July. It is one of the largest such pride events in Southeast Asia, with attendance reaching up to 35,000.

===Europe===
====Southeastern Europe====

The first southeastern European Pride, called &quot;The Internationale Pride&quot;, was assumed to be a promotion of the human right to freedom of assembly in Croatia and some Eastern European states, where such rights of the LGBT population are not respected, and a support for organising the first Prides in those communities.

Out of all ex-Yugoslav states, at that time only Slovenia and Croatia had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in Belgrade, Serbia in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in Zagreb, Croatia from June 22–25, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and Southeastern European countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities.

From 13 countries that participated, only Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania and Latvia have been organizing Prides. Slovakia also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from Slovenska pospolitost (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). North Macedonia and Albania also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. Lithuania has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from Kosovo, that participated apart from Serbia.

It was the first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was Zagreb Pride, which has been held since 2002.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan &quot;Ima Izać&#x27; &quot; (Coming Out).

According to a 2021 study, the first LGBT+ Pride parade in Sarajevo led to increased support for LGBT activism in Sarajevo. It did not however diffuse nationwide.

====Bulgaria====
Like the other countries from the Balkans, Bulgaria&#x27;s population is very conservative when it comes to issues like sexuality.

In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the LGBTQ community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by skinheads
, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto &quot;Rainbow Friendship&quot; attracted more than 300 participants from Bulgaria and tourists from Greece and Great Britain. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.

====Croatia====

First pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in Zagreb and has been held annually ever since. The attendance has gradually grown from 350 in 2002 to 15.000 in 2013. Pride parades are also held in Split (since 2011) and Osijek (since 2014).

The first public demonstration within the LGBT community in Italy took place in San Remo on April 5, 1972, as a protest against the International Congress on Sexual Deviance organized by the Catholic-inspired Italian Center of Sexology. The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain&#x27;s Gay Liberation Front, and Italy&#x27;s activist homosexual rights group &quot;&quot;.

The first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of &quot;Fuori!&quot; held in Turin in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects. Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in Livorno. In Pisa in November of that year, the organized the first march against anti-gay violence. Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.

====Latvia====
On July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in Riga, surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the Riga City Council, and the then-Prime Minister of Latvia, Aigars Kalvītis, opposed the event, stating Riga should &quot;not promote things like that&quot;, however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead. In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by &quot;No Pride&quot; protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed.

In 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around Vērmane Garden, protected physically from &quot;No Pride&quot; protesters by 1,500 Latvian police, with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses. A man and his son were afterwards arrested by the police. This caused some alarm but no injury, although participants did have to run the gauntlet of &quot;No Pride&quot; abuse as they ran to the buses. They were driven to a railway station on the outskirts of Riga, from where they went to a post Pride &quot;relax&quot; at the seaside resort of Jūrmala. Participants included MEPs, Amnesty International observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.

The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the Latvian President. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 &quot;No Pride&quot; protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the &quot;No Pride&quot; protesters separated. Participants were once more &quot;bused&quot; out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.

In 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.

The events were attended by the United States Ambassador to Latvia Judith Garber and the Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Edgars Rinkēvičs.

In 2015, Riga hosted the pan-European EuroPride event with about 5000 participants engaging in approximately 50 cultural and entertainment events.

The Baltic Pride event returned to Riga in 2018, the year of the centenary of the independence of Latvia and all three Baltic states. An estimated 8000 people took part. The events took place for 100 days from March 3 to June 10 with the parade being held through the city on June 9.

====Poland====

The oldest pride parade in Poland, the Equality Parade in Warsaw, has been organized since 2001. In 2005, the parade was forbidden by local authorities (including then-Mayor Lech Kaczyński) but occurred nevertheless. The ban was later declared a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights (Bączkowski and Others v. Poland). In 2008, more than 1,800 people joined the march.

====Russia====

Prides in Russia are generally banned by city authorities in St. Petersburg and Moscow, due to opposition from politicians and religious leaders. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described the proposed Moscow Pride as &quot;satanic&quot;. Attempted parades have led to clashes between protesters and counter-protesters, with the police acting to keep the two apart and disperse participants. In 2007 British activist Peter Tatchell was physically assaulted. This was not the case in the high-profile attempted march in May 2009, during the Eurovision Song Contest. In this instance the police played an active role in arresting pride marchers. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia has until January 20, 2010, to respond to cases of pride parades being banned in 2006, 2007 and 2008. In June 2012, Moscow courts enacted a hundred-year ban on pride parades.

=====Belgrade Pride=====

Belgrade Pride is an annual LGBTQ+ pride parade and festival held in Belgrade, Serbia. It is the most prominent LGBTQ+ event in Serbia and has a history marked by both struggle and progress.

The first attempt to hold a Belgrade Pride march in 2001 was met with violence from opponents, and subsequent attempts faced government bans and clashes with extremists. In 2014, a turning point was reached when the first major, peaceful Pride march took place with significant police protection.

Since 2014, Belgrade Pride has become a more regular and peaceful event, with growing participation. In 2023, Belgrade Pride saw its largest ever turnout, marking a significant step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in Serbia.

In 2022, Belgrade hosted EuroPride. The Government of Serbia banned the Pride march due to the potential risk for its participants shown by protests by extremist ultra-right-wing organizations. Despite the ban, the EuroPride march happened and approximately 10 000 people walked the shortened march route. Minor incidents happened during the parade walk, orchestrated by opponents of Europride.

====Slovenia====
Although first LGBTQ festival in Slovenia dates to 1984, namely the Ljubljana Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the first pride parade was only organized in 2001 after a gay couple was asked to leave a Ljubljana café for being homosexual. Ljubljana pride is traditionally supported by the mayor of Ljubljana and left-wing politicians.

On June 30, 2019, Maribor held their first pride parade which was largely supported by several embassy ambassadors and other organizations.

====Spain====
Spain&#x27;s first pride parade was held in Barcelona on 26 June 1977, but was violently repressed by police, as official attitudes towards the LGBT community had not yet changed much since Franco&#x27;s death in 1975. However, &quot;Orgull de Barcelona&quot; (&quot;Barcelona Pride&quot;) is nowadays a yearly event, and local politicians attend. The 2022 gathering drew a crowd of some 90,000.
Madrid Pride Parade, known as &quot;Fiesta del Orgullo Gay&quot; (or simply &quot;Fiesta del Orgullo&quot;), &quot;Manifestación Estatal del Orgullo LGTB&quot; and &quot;Día del Orgullo Gay&quot; (or simply &quot;Día del Orgullo&quot;), is held the first Saturday after June 28 since 1979.

The event is organised by COGAM (Madrid GLTB Collective) and FELGTB (Spanish Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Transsexuals and Bisexuals) and supported by other national and international LGTB groups. The first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain&#x27;s dictator Francisco Franco, with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like Microsoft, Google and Schweppes and several political parties and trade unions, including Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, PODEMOS, United Left, Union, Progress and Democracy, CCOO and UGT have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the Spanish government.

In 2007, Europride, the European Pride Parade, took place in Madrid. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district Chueca, the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. Barcelona, Valencia and Seville hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 Barcelona hosted the Eurogames.

In 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at Maspalomas, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, one of one Europe&#x27;s most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

Several Swedish cities have their own Pride festivals, most notably Gothenburg and Malmö. In 2018, Stockholm Pride and Gothenburg West Pride, co-hosted the 25th annual EuroPride parade.

====Turkey====

Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country in which a gay pride march was held. However, the parades have been banned nationwide since 2015. Authorities cite security concerns and threats from far-right and Islamist groups, but severe police retribution against marchers had led to accusations of discrimination tied to the country&#x27;s increasing Islamisation under President
Erdogan.

In Istanbul (since 2003), in Ankara (since 2008) and in İzmir (since 2013) LGBTQ marches were being held each year with an increasing participation. Gay pride march in Istanbul started with 30 people in 2003 and in 2010 the participation became 5,000. The pride March 2011 and 2012 were attended by more than 15,000 participants.
On June 30, 2013, the pride parade attracted almost 100,000 people. The protesters were joined by Gezi Park protesters, making the 2013 Istanbul Pride the biggest pride ever held in Turkey. On the same day, the first İzmir Pride took place with 2000 participants. Another pride took place in Antalya. Politicians of the biggest opposition party, CHP and another opposition party, BDP also lent their support to the demonstration. The pride march in Istanbul does not receive any support of the municipality or the government.

On June 28, 2015, police in Istanbul interrupted the parade, which the organisers said was not permitted that year due to the holy month Ramadan, by firing pepper spray and rubber bullets.

====United Kingdom====
There are five main pride events in the UK LGBT pride calendar: London, Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham being the largest and are the cities with the biggest gay populations.

Pride in London is one of the biggest in Europe and takes place on the final Saturday in June or first Saturday in July each year. London also hosted a Black Pride in August and Soho Pride or a similar event every September. During the early-1980s, there was a women-only Lesbian Strength march held each year a week before the Gay Pride march. 2012 saw World Pride coming to London.

Starting in 2017, there is a Pride parade for the city&#x27;s black community that takes place the day after the main Pride parade, at the Vauxhall Gardens. In February 2018, the charity Stonewall announced that they would support Black Pride instead of the main Pride parade.

Brighton Pride is held on the first Saturday of August (apart from in 2012 when the event was moved to September due to the 2012 Olympics). The event starts from the seafront and culminating at Preston Park.

===North America===
==== Barbados ====

The island nation held its first pride parade in July 2018. It attracted a diverse group, which included members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, allies of the community, tourists and at least one member of the local clergy who came out strongly in support of the LGBT movement.

====Canada====
=====Montreal=====
Montreal Pride Parade, is held in mid-August and has taken place every year since 1979, when a group of 200 people commemorated New York City&#x27;s 1969 Stonewall Riots with &quot;Gairilla&quot;, a precursor to Montreal&#x27;s gay pride parade celebrations. The LGBTQ+ festivities take place over eleven days, with events centered around the Gay Village.

In May 2023, Montreal Pride launched a comprehensive rebrand of its website and logo, meant to signal that the non-profit had moved on from the last-minute cancellation of the 2022 parade, which was cancelled due to a lack of organization.

Montreal Pride has hired 200 additional employees with event planning experience to ensure the August 13, 2023 parade is well-organized and prepared for the 100,000 expected attendees.

=====Ottawa=====
Ottawa Pride Parade, inaugurated in 1989, is an annual LGBT pride event spanning Canada&#x27;s capital city of Ottawa, Ontario, and its neighbour Gatineau, Quebec. Over the years, this event has significantly grown and is now a prominent fixture held on the fourth Sunday of August. It serves as a crucial platform for promoting LGBTQ+ rights and visibility, playing a vital role in achieving legal victories and advancing inclusivity initiatives. The parade underscores the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights, emphasizing principles of equality, diversity, and inclusion in the National Capital Region.

The Parade is a pivotal component of the larger festival, known as &#x27;Capital Pride / La Fierté dans la Capitale&#x27; in both English and French, reflecting the bilingual nature of the region.

Ottawa&#x27;s inaugural Pride Parade took place on Sunday, June 18, 1989, initially occurring annually in June until 1994 when it was rescheduled to July. In 2005, the Pride Festival moved from Bank Street back to Festival Plaza due to the high costs and outstanding debts of the Pride Committee. Consequently, the festival&#x27;s dates were shifted from July to August, aligning with constraints at Festival Plaza. This scheduling adjustment is the reason why Ottawa&#x27;s Pride Parade is held on the fourth Sunday of August each year.

The Ottawa Capital Pride Parade serves as a powerful symbol of LGBTQ+ pride and unity within the Ottawa community. Beyond its local significance, the event extends a warm welcome to 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals worldwide, fostering a sense of global community and emphasizing the interconnectedness of local and national pride with broader international movements. In essence, the Ottawa Pride Parade stands as a vibrant and inclusive expression of LGBTQ+ pride, leaving a lasting impact on both the local and global stage.

Jason Gordon said: &quot;TT is a democracy and as such members of society have a right to protest whenever they believe their rights are not being upheld or violated. (The) LGBT+ community has several areas where there is legitimate concern and these have to be taken seriously by the country and by the government and people of TT. &quot;

====United States====
The first pride parade was the Chicago Pride Parade, which has been hosted annually since June 27, 1970. It also is the largest pride parade in Illinois.

In 2015, the Stonewall Inn was declared a historic landmark by the City of New York, which was then upgraded the next year by US President Barack Obama to a national monument.

Pride festivals, celebrations of LGBTQ+ identity and community, are often associated with major metropolitan areas. However, rural and small-town America has witnessed a flourishing of pride events in recent decades. While the exact number is difficult to pinpoint due to varying levels of promotion, estimates suggest that nearly half of all pride celebrations in the United States take place in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. These rural pride festivals hold a special significance. They provide a vital space for LGBTQ+ individuals in smaller communities to connect, celebrate their identities, and find acceptance. In areas where isolation and discrimination can be more pronounced, pride festivals offer a sense of belonging and foster important social networks.

Rural Pride festivals often possess a distinct character compared to their urban counterparts. Events tend to be smaller in scale, fostering a closer-knit atmosphere. Local businesses and community organizations are frequently involved, lending the celebrations a personal touch. Events may feature parades, drag performances, barbecues, potlucks, and line dancing.

One rural pride event, the Borderland Pride parade, is a unique pride celebration held annually. It takes place in International Falls, Minnesota, United States, and concludes in Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada, making it the only Pride march to cross an international border. Participants gather at Smokey Bear Park in International Falls before proceeding to the Canadian Border Services Agency office. After crossing the border, the march concludes at Rainy Lake Square in Fort Frances, where festivities including food and entertainment take place.

===== New York =====

The annual New York City Pride March began on June 28, 1970. The New York City Pride March rivals the Sao Paulo Gay Pride Parade as the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June.

On June 30, 2019, State of New York hosted the largest international LGBT pride celebration in history, known as Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. The twelve-hour parade included 150,000 pre-registered participants among 695 groups and an estimated five million visitors.

<text>The Savinja () is a river in northeast Slovenia which flows mostly in the Upper and Lower Savinja Valley () and through the cities of Celje and Laško. The Savinja is the main river of the Savinja Alps (Sln. &quot;Savinjske Alpe&quot;). It flows into the Sava River at the town of Zidani Most. It has often flooded, such as in the 1960s, 1990, and 1995. The Savinja has a length of and a catchment area of .

== Sources ==
The stream is created by Rinka Falls, which flows along a regulated riverbed to the lower end of the Logar Valley, where it flows into Jezera Creek, from which point it becomes the Savinja River. This spring has been proclaimed a natural heritage object, and Rinka Falls is one of the most beautiful and best-known waterfalls in Slovenia. It is the highest waterfall of the 20 waterfalls in the Logar Valley and is visited throughout the year. In the winter it is popular for ice-climbers. The best view of the waterfall is from Kamnik Saddle ().

== Tributaries ==
The main tributaries of the Savinja are the Jušef and the Klobaša at Solčava, the Lučnica at Luče, the Ljubnica at Ljubno, the Dreta at Nazarje, the Paka at Šmartno ob Paki, and the Ložnica and Voglajna with the Hudinja at Celje.

== Water quality ==
The quality of water is first-class to Radmirje, then it falls to second class and after to third.

== Hydronym and etymology ==
The name &quot;Savinja&quot; (attested in written sources in 980 as &quot;Sovuina&quot;) is derived from &quot;*Savьn′a&quot;, in turn derived from the hydronym &quot;Sava&quot;, of which it is a tributary. The German name &quot;Sann&quot; was attested later. In the local dialect, the river is known as &quot;Sáńe&quot;. The form *&quot;Savьn′a&quot; should have yielded &quot;Savnja&quot; as the current Slovene name, but it was reshaped on the model of &quot;Hudinja&quot;. The name is believed to ultimately not be of Slavic origin, but of older pre-Slavic origin.

The German name &quot;Sann&quot; was also used in some older English sources; for example, in the ninth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica from 1911.

Some other names for the river include:
* &quot;fluvius Sana&quot; (9th century)
* &quot;Souina&quot; (980)
* &quot;inter fluenta Souuuę et Sounę&quot; (1016)
* &quot;Seuna&quot; (1016)
* &quot;Souna&quot; (1025,1028)
* &quot;inter fluenta Souuuae et Sounae&quot; (1028)
* &quot;Sounital&quot; (1042)

The Celtic goddess Adsaluta, whose altars were found in the area of the settlement of Sava, was long identified with the Savinja. Modern scholars have rejected the connection.

== Life along the river ==

Raftsmen from Ljubno traveled along the river until the 1950s. In their memory, a bronze sculpture of a raftsman (&quot;Splavar&quot;), created in 1961 by Boris Kalin, stands on the river&#x27;s left bank in Celje.

<text>AirPort is a discontinued line of wireless routers and network cards developed by Apple Inc. using Wi-Fi protocols. In Japan, the line of products was marketed under the brand AirMac due to previous registration by I-O Data.

Apple introduced the AirPort line in 1999. Wireless cards were discontinued in 2009 following the Mac transition to Intel processors, after all of Apple&#x27;s Mac products had adopted built-in Wi-Fi. Apple&#x27;s line of wireless routers consisted of the AirPort Base Station (later AirPort Extreme); the AirPort Time Capsule, a variant with a built-in hard disk for automated backups; and the AirPort Express, a compact router.

In 2018, Apple discontinued the AirPort line. The remaining inventory was sold off, and Apple later retailed routers from Linksys, Netgear, and Eero in Apple retail stores.

==Overview==
AirPort debuted in 1999, as &quot;one more thing&quot; at Macworld New York, with Steve Jobs surfing the web on an iBook using wireless internet technology for the very first time in a public demo of an Apple laptop. The initial offering consisted of an optional expansion card for Apple&#x27;s new line of iBook notebooks and an AirPort Base Station. The AirPort card (a repackaged Lucent ORiNOCO Gold Card PC Card adapter) was later added as an option for almost all of Apple&#x27;s product line, including PowerBooks, eMacs, iMacs, and Power Macs. Only Xserves did not have it as a standard or optional feature. The original AirPort system allowed transfer rates up to 11 Mbit/s and was commonly used to share Internet access and files between multiple computers.

In 2003, Apple introduced AirPort Extreme, based on the 802.11g specification, using Broadcom&#x27;s BCM4306/BCM2050 two-chip solution. AirPort Extreme allows theoretical peak data transfer rates of up to 54 Mbit/s, and is fully backward-compatible with existing 802.11b wireless network cards and base stations. Several of Apple&#x27;s desktop computers and portable computers, including the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Mini, and iMac shipped with an AirPort Extreme (802.11g) card as standard. All other Macs of the time had an expansion slot for the card. AirPort and AirPort Extreme cards are not physically compatible: AirPort Extreme cards cannot be installed in older Macs, and AirPort cards cannot be installed in newer Macs. The original AirPort card was discontinued in June 2004.

In 2004, Apple released the AirPort Express base station as a &quot;Swiss Army knife&quot; multifunction product. It can be used as a portable travel router, using the same AC connectors as on Apple&#x27;s AC adapters; as an audio streaming device, with both line-level and optical audio outputs; and as a USB printer sharing device, through its USB host port.

In 2007, Apple unveiled a new AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N) Base Station, which introduced 802.11 Draft-N to the Apple AirPort product line. This implementation of 802.11 Draft-N can operate in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz ISM bands, and has modes that make it compatible with 802.11b/g and 802.11a. The number of Ethernet ports was increased to four—one nominally for WAN, three for LAN, but all can be used in bridged mode. A USB port was included for printers and other USB devices. The Ethernet ports were later updated to Gigabit Ethernet on all ports. The styling is similar to that of the Mac Mini and Apple TV.

In January 2008, Apple introduced Time Capsule, an AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N) with an internal hard drive. The device includes software to allow any computer running a reasonably recent version of Mac OS or Windows to access the disk as a shared volume. Macs running Mac OS X 10.5 and later, which includes the Time Machine feature, can use the Time Capsule as a wireless backup device, allowing automatic, untethered backups of the client computer. As an access point, the unit is otherwise equivalent to an AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N), with four Gigabit Ethernet ports and a USB port for printer and disk sharing.

In March 2008, Apple released an updated AirPort Express Base Station with 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 radio. All other features (analog and digital optical audio out, single Ethernet port, USB port for printer sharing) remained the same. At the time, it was the least expensive ($99) device to handle both frequency bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) in 2x2 802.11 Draft-N.

In March 2009, Apple unveiled AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule products with simultaneous dual-band 802.11 Draft-N radios. This allows full 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 communication in both 802.11 Draft-N bands at the same time.

In October 2009, Apple unveiled the updated AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule products with antenna improvements (the 5.8 GHz model).

In 2011, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme base station, referred to as AirPort Extreme 802.11n (5th Generation). The latest AirPort base stations and cards work with third-party base stations and wireless cards that conformed to the 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11 Draft-N, and 802.11 Final-N networking standards. It was not uncommon to see wireless networks composed of several types of AirPort base station serving old and new Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Linux systems. Apple&#x27;s software drivers for AirPort Extreme also supported some Broadcom and Atheros-based PCI Wireless adapters when fitted to Power Mac computers. Due to the developing nature of Draft-N hardware, there was no assurance that the new model would work with all 802.11 Draft-N routers and access devices from other manufacturers.

===Discontinuation===
In approximately 2016, Apple disbanded its wireless router team. In 2018, Apple formally discontinued all of its AirPort products, exiting the router market. Bloomberg News noted that &quot;Apple rarely discontinues product categories&quot; and that its decision to leave the business was &quot;a boon for other wireless router makers.&quot;

==AirPort routers==

An AirPort router is used to connect AirPort-enabled computers to the Internet, each other, a wired LAN, and/or other devices.

===AirPort Base Station===

The original AirPort Base Station (known as &quot;Graphite&quot;, model M5757, part number M7601LL/B) features a dial-up modem and an Ethernet port. It employs a Lucent WaveLAN Silver PC Card as the Radio, and uses an embedded AMD Élan SC410 processor. It connects to the machine via the Ethernet port. It was released July 21, 1999. The Graphite AirPort Base Station is functionally identical to the Lucent RG-1000 wireless base station and can run the same firmware. Due to the original firmware-locked limitations of the Silver card, the unit can only accept 40-bit WEP encryption. Later aftermarket tweaks can enable 128-bit WEP on the Silver card. Aftermarket Linux firmware has been developed for these units to extend their useful service life.

A second-generation model (known as &quot;Dual Ethernet&quot; or &quot;Snow&quot;, model M8440, part number M8209LL/A) was introduced on November 13, 2001. It features a second Ethernet port when compared to the Graphite design, allowing for a shared Internet connection with both wired and wireless clients. Also new (but available for the original model via software update) was the ability to connect to and share America Online&#x27;s dial-up service—a feature unique to Apple base stations. This model is based on Motorola&#x27;s PowerPC 855 processor and contained a fully functional original AirPort Card, which can be removed and used in any compatible Macintosh computer.

===AirPort Extreme Base Station===
Three different configurations of model A1034 are all called the &quot;AirPort Extreme Base Station&quot;:1. M8799LL/A – 2 Ethernet ports, 1 USB port, external antenna connector, 1 56k (V.90) modem port2. M8930LL/A – 2 Ethernet ports, 1 USB port, external antenna connector.3. M9397LL/A – 2 Ethernet ports, 1 USB port, external antenna connector, powered over Ethernet cable (PoE/UL2043)

The AirPort Base Station was discontinued after the updated AirPort Extreme was announced on January 7, 2003. In addition to providing wireless connection speeds of up to a maximum of 54 Mbit/s, it adds an external antenna port and a USB port. The antenna port allows the addition of a signal-boosting antenna, and the USB port allows the sharing of a USB printer. A connected printer is made available via Bonjour&#x27;s &quot;zero configuration&quot; technology and IPP to all wired and wireless clients on the network. The CPU is an AU1500-333MBC Alchemy (processor). A second model (M8930LL/A) lacking the modem and external antenna port was briefly made available, but then discontinued after the launch of AirPort Express (see below). On April 19, 2004, a third version, marketed as the &quot;AirPort Extreme Base Station (with Power over Ethernet and UL 2043)&quot;, was introduced that supports Power over Ethernet and complies to the UL 2043 specifications for safe usage in air handling spaces, such as above suspended ceilings. All three models support the Wireless Distribution System (WDS) standard. The model introduced in January 2007 does not have a corresponding PoE, UL-compliant variant.

An AirPort Extreme base station can serve a maximum of 50 wireless clients simultaneously.

===AirPort Extreme 802.11n===
The AirPort Extreme was updated on January 9, 2007, to support the 802.11n protocol. This revision also adds two LAN ports for a total of three. It now more closely resembles the square-shaped 1st generation Apple TV and Mac Mini, and is about the same size as the mini.

The new AirPort Disk feature allows users to plug a USB hard drive into the AirPort Extreme for use as a network-attached storage (NAS) device for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows clients. Users may also connect a USB hub and printer. The performance of USB hard drives attached to an AirPort Extreme is slower than if the drive were connected directly to a computer. This is due to the processor speed on the AirPort extreme. Depending on the setup and types of reads and writes, performance ranges from 0.5 to 17.5 MB/s for writing and 1.9 to 25.6 MB/s for reading. Performance for the same disk connected directly to a computer would be 6.6 to 31.6 MB/s for writing and 7.1 to 37.2 MB/s for reading.

The AirPort Extreme has no port for an external antenna.

On August 7, 2007, the AirPort Extreme began shipping with Gigabit Ethernet, matching most other Apple products.

On March 19, 2008, Apple released a firmware update for both models of the AirPort Extreme to allow AirPort Disks to be used in conjunction with Time Machine, similar to the functionality provided by Time Capsule.
On March 3, 2009, Apple unveiled a new AirPort Extreme with simultaneous dual-band 802.11 Draft-N radios. This allows full 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 communication in both 802.11 Draft-N bands at the same time.

On October 20, 2009, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme base station with antenna improvements.

On June 21, 2011, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme base station, referred to as &quot;AirPort Extreme 802.11n (5th Generation)&quot;.

===AirPort Express===

The AirPort Express is a simplified and compact AirPort Extreme base station. It allows up to 50 networked users, and includes a feature called AirTunes (predecessor to AirPlay). The original version (M9470LL/A, model A1084) was introduced by Apple on June 7, 2004, and includes an analog–optical audio mini-jack output, a USB port for remote printing or charging the iPod (iPod Shuffle only), and a single Ethernet port. The USB port cannot be used to connect a hard disk or other storage device.

The AirPort Express functions as a wireless access point when connected to an Ethernet network. It can be used as an Ethernet-to-wireless bridge under certain wireless configurations.
It can be used to extend the range of a network, or as a printer and audio server.

In 2012, the AirPort Express took on a new shape, similar to that of the second and third generation Apple TV. The new product also features two 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet LAN ports.

===AirPort Time Capsule===

The AirPort Time Capsule is a version of AirPort Extreme with a built-in hard drive currently coming in either 2 TB or 3 TB sizes, with a previous version having 1 TB or 500 GB. It features a built-in design that, when used with Time Machine in Mac OS X Leopard, automatically makes incremental data backups. Acting as a wireless file server, AirPort Time Capsule can serve to back up multiple Macs. It also includes all AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N) functionality.

On March 3, 2009, the Time Capsule was updated with simultaneous dual-band 802.11 Draft-N capability, remote AirPort Disk accessibility through Back to My Mac, and the ability to broadcast a guest network at the same time as an existing network.

On October 20, 2009, Apple unveiled the updated Time Capsule with antenna improvements resulting in wireless performance gains of both speed and range. Also stated is a resulting performance improvement/time reduction on Time Capsule backups of up to 60%.

In June 2011, Apple unveiled the updated Time Capsule with a higher capacity 2 TB and 3 TB. They also changed the wireless card from a Marvell chip to a Broadcom BCM4331 chip. When used in conjunction with the latest 2011 MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and MacBook Airs (which also use a Broadcom BCM4331 wireless chip), the wireless signal is improved thanks to Broadcom&#x27;s Frame Bursting technology.

On June 10, 2013, Apple renamed the Time Capsule to the AirPort Time Capsule and added support for the 802.11ac standard.

==AirPort cards==
Apple produced numerous wireless card used to connect to wireless networks such as those provided by an AirPort Base Station.

===AirPort 802.11b card===
The original model, known as simply &quot;AirPort card&quot;, was a re-branded Lucent WaveLAN/Orinoco Gold PC card, in a modified housing that lacked the integrated antenna. It was designed to be capable of being user-installable. It was also modified in such a way that it could not be used in a regular PCMCIA slot (at the time it was significantly cheaper than the official WaveLAN/Orinoco Gold card).

An AirPort card adapter is required to use this card in the slot-loading iMacs.

===AirPort Extreme 802.11g cards===

Corresponding with the release of the AirPort Extreme Base Station, the AirPort Extreme card became available as an option on the current models. It is based on a Broadcom 802.11g chipset and is housed in a custom form factor, but is electrically compatible with the Mini PCI standard. It was also capable of being user-installed.

Variants of the user-installable AirPort Extreme card are marked A-1010 (early North American spec), A-1026 (current North American spec), A-1027 (Europe/Asia spec (additional channels)) and A-1095 (unknown).

A different 802.11g card was included in the last iteration of the PowerPC-based PowerBooks and iBooks. A major distinction for this card was that it was the first &quot;combo&quot; card that included both 802.11g as well as Bluetooth. It was also the first card that was not user-installable. It was again a custom form factor, but was still electrically a Mini PCI interface for the Broadcom WLAN chip. A separate USB connection was used for the on-board Bluetooth chip.

The AirPort Extreme (802.11g) card was discontinued in January 2009.

===Integrated AirPort Extreme 802.11a/b/g and /n cards===

As 802.11g began to come standard on all notebook models, Apple phased out the user-installable designs in their notebooks, iMacs and Mac Minis by mid-2005, moving to an integrated design. AirPort continued to be an option, either installed at purchase or later, on the Power Mac G5 and the Mac Pro.With the introduction of the Intel-based MacBook Pro in January 2006, Apple began to use a standard PCI Express mini card. The particular brand and model of card has changed over the years; in early models, it was Atheros brand, while since late 2008 they have been Broadcom cards. This distinction is mostly of concern to those who run other operating systems such as Linux on MacBooks, as different cards require different device drivers.

The MacBook Air Mid 2012 13&quot;, MacBook Air Mid 2011 13&quot; and MacBook Air Late 2010 (11&quot;, A1370 and 13&quot;, Model A1369) each use a Broadcom BCM 943224 PCIEBT2 Wi-Fi card (main chip BCM43224: 2 × 2 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).

The MacBook Pro Retina Mid 2012 uses Broadcom BCM94331CSAX (main chip BCM4331: 3 × 3 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, up to 450 Mbit/s).

In early 2007, Apple announced that most Intel Core 2 Duo-based Macs, which had been shipping since November 2006, already included AirPort Extreme cards compatible with the draft-802.11 Draft-N specification. Apple also offered an application to enable 802.11 Draft-N functionality on these Macs for a fee of $1.99, or free with the purchase of an AirPort Extreme base station. Starting with Leopard, the Draft-N functionality was quietly enabled on all Macs that had Draft-N cards. This card was also a PCI Express mini design, but used three antenna connectors in the notebooks and iMacs, in order to use a 2 × 3 MIMO antenna configuration. The cards in the Mac Pro and Apple TV have two antenna connectors and support a 2 × 2 configuration. The Network Utility application located in &quot;Applications → Utilities&quot; can be used to identify the model and supported protocols of an installed AirPort card.

=== Integrated AirPort Extreme 802.11ac cards ===
The Macbook Air Mid 2013 uses a Broadcom BCM94360CS2 (main chip BCM4360: 2 × 2 : 2).

==Security==
AirPort and AirPort Extreme support a variety of security technologies to prevent eavesdropping and unauthorized network access, including several forms of cryptography.

The original graphite AirPort base station used 40-bit Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). The second-generation model (known as Dual Ethernet or Snow) AirPort base station, like most other Wi-Fi products, used 40-bit or 128-bit Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). AirPort Extreme and Express base stations retain this option, but also allow and encourage the use of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and, as of July 14, 2005, WPA2.

AirPort Extreme cards, which use the Broadcom chipset, have the media access control layer in software. The driver is closed source.

==AirPort Disk==
The AirPort Disk feature shares a hard disk connected to an AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule (though not AirPort Express), as a small-scale NAS. AirPort Disk can be accessed from Windows and Linux as well as Mac OS X using the SMB/CIFS protocol for FAT volumes, and both SMB/CIFS and AFP for HFS+ partitions. NTFS- or exFAT-formatted volumes are not supported.

Although Windows does not natively support HFS+, an HFS+ volume on an AirPort Disk can be easily accessed from Windows. This is because the SMB/CIFS protocol used to access the disk, and hence access from Windows is filesystem-independent. Therefore, HFS+ is a viable option for Windows as well as OS X users, and more flexible than FAT32 as the latter has a 4 GiB file size limit.

Recent firmware versions cause the internal disk and any external USB drives to sleep after periods of time as short as 2 minutes.

A caveat of the use of AirPort Disk is that the AFP port 548 is reserved for the service, which then does not allow for simultaneous use of port forwarding to provide AFP services to external users. This is also true of a Time Capsule setup for use as a network-based Time Machine Backup location, its main purpose and default configuration. An AirPort administrator must choose between using AirPort Disk and providing remote access to AFP services.

The AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule will recognize multiple disks connected via a USB hub.

<doc id="58180" wikidata="Q187882" url="?curid=58180" title="Freckle">
<text>Freckles are clusters of concentrated melaninized cells which are most easily visible on people with a fair complexion. Freckles do not have an increased number of the melanin-producing cells, or melanocytes, but instead have melanocytes that overproduce melanin granules (melanosomes) changing the coloration of the outer skin cells (keratinocytes). As such, freckles are different from lentigines and moles, which are caused by accumulation of melanocytes in a small area. Freckles can appear on all types of skin tones. Of the six Fitzpatrick skin types, they are most common on skin tones 1 and 2, which usually belong to North Europeans. However, it can also be found on people all over the world. In England a historical term for freckles is summer-voys, sometimes spelt summervoise, which may be related to the German term &quot;Sommersprossen&quot;.

==Biology==
The formation of freckles is caused by exposure to sunlight. The exposure to UV-B radiation activates melanocytes to increase melanin production, which can cause freckles to become darker and more visible. This means that one who has never developed freckles may develop them suddenly following extended exposure to sunlight.

Freckles are predominantly found on the face, although they may appear on any skin exposed to the sun, such as arms or shoulders. Heavily distributed concentrations of melanin may cause freckles to multiply and cover an entire area of skin, such as the face. Freckles are rare on infants, and more commonly found on children before puberty.
Upon exposure to the sun, freckles will reappear if they have been altered with creams or lasers and not protected from the sun, but do fade with age in some cases.

Freckles are not a skin disorder, but people with freckles generally have a lower concentration of photo-protective melanin, and are therefore more susceptible to the harmful effects of UV radiation. It is suggested that people whose skin tends to freckle should avoid overexposure to sun and use sunscreen.

===Genetics===

The presence of freckles is related to rare alleles of the MC1R gene, though it does not differentiate whether an individual will have freckles if they have one or even two copies of this gene. Also, individuals with no copies of the MC1R do sometimes display freckles. Even so, individuals with a high number of freckling sites have one or more of variants of the MC1R gene. Of the variants of the MC1R gene Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, and Asp294His are the most common in the freckled subjects. The MC1R gene is also associated with red hair more strongly than with freckles. Most red-haired individuals have two variants of the MC1R gene and almost all have one. The variants that cause red hair are the same that cause freckling. Freckling can also be found in areas, such as Japan, where red hair is not seen. These individuals have the variant Val92Met which is also found in Europeans, although it has minimal effects on their pigmentation. The R162Q allele has a disputed involvement in freckling.

The variants of the MC1R gene that are linked with freckles started to emerge in the human genotype when humans started to leave Africa. The variant Val92Met arose somewhere between 250,000 and 100,000 years ago, long enough for this gene to be carried by humans into central Asia. Arg160Trp is estimated to have arisen around 80,000 years ago while Arg151Cys and Asp294His have been estimated to arise around 30,000 years ago. The wide variation of the MC1R gene exists in people of European descent because of the lack of strong environmental pressures on the gene. The original allele of MC1R is coded for dark skin with a high melanin content in the cells. The high melanin content is protective in areas of high UV light exposure. The need was less as humans moved into higher latitudes where incoming sunlight has lower UV light content. The adaptation of lighter skin is needed so that individuals in higher latitudes can still absorb enough UV for the production of vitamin D. Freckled individuals tend to tan less and have very light skin, an adaptation to allow individuals that expressed these genes to synthesise sufficient vitamin D.

==Types==
&quot;Ephelides&quot; describes a freckle that is flat and light brown or red and fades with a reduction of sun exposure. Ephelides are more common in those with light complexions, although they are found on people with a variety of skin tones. The regular use of sunblock can inhibit their development.

Liver spots (also known as sunspots and lentigines) look like large freckles, but they form after years of exposure to the sun. Liver spots are more common in older people.

==In culture==
Western societies traditionally perceived freckles as imperfections. For example, Pliny the Elder described freckles as spiritual and religious stains. 

This perception changed after the mid-20th century, when a tan, and the freckles associated with it, came to be desired as a status symbol indicating a life of leisure. Freckles became increasingly fashionable in the late 20th century as a result of the 1960s &quot;youthquake&quot; movement and through association with popular figures such as the model Twiggy and the musician Jane Birkin. In the early 2000s, freckled models were a trend in advertising and fashion.

By the 2020s, the popularity of freckle tattoos further increased due to their popularity on social media such as TikTok.

<doc id="58183" wikidata="Q2485385" url="?curid=58183" title="Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork">
<text>Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork (13 October 1566 – 15 September 1643), also known as the Great Earl of Cork, was an English politician who served as Lord Treasurer of the Kingdom of Ireland.

Lord Cork was an important figure in the continuing English colonisation of Ireland in the 16th and 17th centuries, as he acquired large tracts of land in plantations in Munster in southern Ireland. Moreover, his sons played an important role in fighting against the Irish Catholic rebellion in the 1640s and 1650s, assisting in the victory of the British and Protestant interests in Ireland.

In addition to being the first Earl of Cork, he was the patriarch of the Boyle family through his many prominent descendants, whose titles included Earl of Orrery (1660), Earl of Burlington (1664) and Earl of Shannon (1756).

==Background==
Boyle was born at Canterbury on 13 October 1566, the second son of Roger Boyle (d. 24 March 1576 at Preston, near Faversham in Kent), a descendant of an ancient landed Herefordshire family, and of Joan (15 October 1529 –20 March 1586), daughter of John Naylor, who were married in Canterbury on 16 October 1564. Both his parents are interred in an alabaster tomb at the upper end of the chancel of the parish church of Preston. His elder brother was John Boyle, Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross.

Young Boyle went to The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, at the same time as Christopher Marlowe. His university education began at Bennet (Corpus Christi) College, Cambridge, England, in 1583. After this he studied law at the Middle Temple in London and became a clerk to Sir Roger Manwood, Kt., who was then the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer.

Before completing his studies, Boyle decided &quot;to gain learning, knowledge, and experience abroad in the world&quot; and left London for a new start in Ireland. He arrived in Dublin on 23 June 1588 with just over £27 (equivalent to £ in ),as well as a gold bracelet worth £10 (£ in ), and a diamond ring (given to him by his mother at her death and which he wore all his life), besides some fine clothing, and his &quot;rapier and dagger&quot;.

In 1590 he obtained the appointment of deputy Escheator to John Crofton, the Escheator-General. On 6 November 1595, he married Joan Apsley, the daughter and co-heiress of William Apsley of Limerick, one of the council to the first President of the province of Munster. This marriage brought Boyle an estate of £500 a year (equivalent to £ in ), which he continued to receive until at least 1632.

Joan died at Mallow, County Cork on 14 December 1599 during childbirth (the son was still-born). Both were buried in Buttevant church, County Cork.

It is said by his detractors that unlike many of his other close relatives whom he took great care to commemorate, he took no trouble to have Joan commemorated after her death, leading to the conviction among some that his (in every sense) monumental commemorative endeavours were entirely practical (in terms of securing his personal objectives) rather than sentimental (her connections being of no direct use to him after her death).

==Political career==
Boyle by this time had been the object of the attacks of Sir Henry Wallop, Treasurer at War, Sir Robert Gardiner, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Sir Robert Dillon, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, and Sir Richard Bingham, Chief Commissioner of Connaught, a demonstration, said Boyle, of their envy of his success and increasing prosperity.

Boyle was arrested on charges of fraud and collusion with the Spanish (essentially accusations of covert papist infiltration, a treasonable offence for an official in Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s Protestant civil service) in his office. He was thrown into prison (at least once by Sir William FitzWilliam in about 1592) several times during this episode. He was about to leave for England to justify himself to Queen Elizabeth I, when there was a rebellion in Munster in October 1598, and &quot;all my lands were wasted&quot; which once again returned him to poverty. The Nine Years&#x27; War arrived in Munster with Irish rebels from Ulster, who were joined by locals who had lost land to English settlers. Boyle was forced to flee to Cork for safety.

This turn of events left him obliged to return to London and his chambers at The Temple. At this point, he was almost immediately taken into the service of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.

Henry Wallop then renewed his prosecution of Boyle. Boyle was summoned to appear at the Court of Star Chamber. In the proceedings, Boyle&#x27;s adversaries seem to have failed to substantiate their accusations. Boyle had somehow managed to secure the attendance of Queen Elizabeth I herself at the proceedings, and he successfully exposed some misconduct on the part of his adversaries.

Elizabeth famously said: &quot;By God&#x27;s death, these are but inventions against the young man&quot; and she also said he was &quot;a man fit to be employed by ourselves&quot;.

He was immediately appointed Clerk of the Council of Munster by Elizabeth I in 1600. In December 1601, Boyle brought to Elizabeth the news of the victory near Kinsale.

In October 1602, Boyle was again sent over by Sir George Carew, the president of Munster, on Irish affairs. He was knighted at St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, near Dublin, by Carew on 25 July 1603. the same day that he married his second wife, Catherine, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton, Principal Secretary of State. In 1606 he was appointed as Privy Councillor for Munster and in 1612 as Privy Councillor for Ireland.

==Acquisition of property, rank, and titles==

In 1602, Richard Boyle bought Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s estates of for £1,500 (£ in ) in the counties of Cork (including Myrtle Grove), Waterford (including Lismore Castle) and Tipperary. He made these purchases on the insistence of Sir George Carew. Boyle made Lismore Castle his chief country abode after purchasing it and turned it into a magnificent residence with impressive gabled ranges on each side of the courtyard. He also built a crenellated outer wall and a gatehouse known as the Riding Gate for the castle. The principal apartments of the castle were decorated with fretwork plaster ceilings, tapestry hangings, embroidered silks, and velvet. Boyle also had a substantial residence at Youghal, besides Myrtle Grove, known today as &quot;The College&quot;, close to the Collegiate Church of St Mary Youghal. Order on the Boyle estates was maintained in 13 castles which were garrisoned by retainers. The town of Clonakilty was formally founded in 1613 by him when he received a charter from King James I of England.

Boyle was then returned as a burgh commissioner (Member of Parliament) for Lismore in the Irish Parliament of 1614, (held at Dublin Castle) on 18 May 1614. He ascended to the Irish Peerage as Lord Boyle, Baron of Youghal on 6 September 1616.

Lord Boyle claimed to have built the town of Bandon in County Cork, but in fact, the town was planned and built by Henry Beecher, John Archdeacon, and William Newce. The land on which Bandon was built had been granted by Queen Elizabeth I to Phane Beecher in 1586, and inherited by his eldest son Henry who then sold it to Boyle in November 1618. In Bandon, Boyle founded iron-smelting and linen-weaving industries and brought in English settlers, many from Bristol.

Lord Boyle was created Earl of Cork and Viscount Dungarvan on 26 October 1620. He then occupied the office of Sheriff from 1625 to 1626. On 26 October 1629, he was appointed as a Lord Justice, and on 9 November 1631, he became the Lord Treasurer of Ireland. Although he was not a Peer in the English Parliament, it is nonetheless recorded that he was &quot;by writ called into the Upper House by His Majesty&#x27;s great grace&quot;, and he subsequently took up the honoured position of an &quot;assistant sitting on the inside of the Woolsack.&quot;

Oliver Cromwell is reported to have said of Lord Cork &#x27;If there had been an Earl of Cork in every province, it would have been impossible for the Irish to have raised a rebellion.&#x27; One of Lord Cork&#x27;s major political allies during the era was Piers Crosby.

It is a mistake to see Lord Cork&#x27;s &#x27;empire&#x27; as merely being exclusively confined to the development of the &#x27;Raleigh estates&#x27;: for instance, his acquisition of the entirety of the town of Bandon was not completed until 1625. Other towns which also form part of Lord Cork&#x27;s municipal development legacy (which records employment of over 4,000 people during his lifetime) include Midleton, Castlemartyr, Charleville and Doneraile.

By 1636, Lord Cork had opted to live in the West Country to see out the rest of his days. He purchased from The 3rd Earl of Castlehaven, for £5,000, the manor of Stalbridge in Dorset which became his English seat, and in 1637, he laid out a further £20,000 for Temple Coombe Manor, close by in Somerset. Lord Cork, at the insistence of the Howards, also bought Annery House near Bideford in 1640 for £5000. The Earl was most delighted with Annery House and the living that came with the estate; he was also delighted that he could easily travel to Youghal from Bideford. Annery House was left to his sixth son Francis Boyle upon his death in 1643. Lord Cork had also been left the manor of Salcombe in Devon by his friend Thomas Stafford, the illegitimate son of George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes. Salcombe, along with Halberton Manor, was also left to his son Francis and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew.

==Boyle&#x27;s adversaries==
The Great Earl&#x27;s most famous enemy was Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford. Strafford arrived in Ireland in 1633 as Lord Deputy, and at first successfully deprived Boyle of much of his privilege and income. Boyle patiently husbanded forces in opposition to Strafford&#x27;s Irish program and this successful political manoeuvering by Boyle was an important factor in Strafford&#x27;s demise. It may be said in defence of Boyle that he would have been quite prepared to work amicably with Strafford, had Strafford not quickly made it clear that he saw Boyle as an &quot;over-mighty subject&quot;, whose power must be curbed, if not crushed entirely. Boyle initially made friendly overtures, and tried to establish a family link by marrying his eldest son Richard to Elizabeth Clifford, a niece of Strafford&#x27;s first wife, but soon abandoned any hope of an amicable relationship.

An illuminating example of the humiliations to which Wentworth subjected Boyle, was the instance where he forced Boyle to remove his wife&#x27;s tomb from the choir in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. He was also prosecuted in the Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber, for alleged misappropriation of the funds of Youghal College.

Archbishop William Laud delighted in Wentworth&#x27;s attacks on Boyle and wrote: &quot;No physic better than a vomit if it be given in time, and therefore you have taken a very judicious course to administer one so early to my Lord of Cork. I hope it will do him good&quot;.

Laud and Wentworth shared, with King Charles I, the same fate as many others, who at some time in their lives, found reasons to conspire against Boyle: an early demise. With Boyle showing his customary astuteness by putting on a convincing show of politically appropriate response at every crucial juncture. His one serious miscalculation was his failure to anticipate the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

Boyle made an entry concerning Wentworth in his diary: &quot;A most cursed man to all Ireland and to me in particular&quot;.

At Wentworth&#x27;s trial, Boyle was a key witness, but he did not take any other direct part in the prosecution itself. Unsurprisingly, he was in full support of the condemnation of Wentworth and wholeheartedly approved of his execution: he made a grim entry in his diary: &quot;Lord Strafford was beheaded on the Tower Hill, as he well deserved&quot;.

From his children, Boyle expected obedience, although he was a genuinely affectionate father, and far more forgiving of opposition from them than from his political enemies. Lady Mary, &quot;my unruly daughter&quot; angered her father by refusing to marry Lord Clanbrassil on the rather modern ground that she found him repulsive, and again by marrying the future Earl of Warwick, who was then a penniless younger son, against her father&#x27;s wishes; but they were soon reconciled and he furnished her with a generous dowry.

Boyle died at Youghal in September 1643, having been chased off his lands in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. His sons, however, recovered the family estates after the suppression of the rebellion. Boyle&#x27;s tomb is in Youghal&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church.

==Boyle&#x27;s &quot;philosophical&quot; legacy==
Lord Cork has been described as the &quot;first colonial millionaire&quot;.

Historian Roy Foster, in his &quot;Modern Ireland&quot;, calls him an &#x27;epitome of Elizabethan adventurer-colonist in Ireland&#x27;.

The Boyle motto is: &#x27;God&#x27;s Providence is my inheritance&#x27;.

Lord Cork&#x27;s theopolitical philosophy has been described as &#x27;providentialist&#x27; when contrasted with its counterpart which prevailed to the north in parts of Ulster at the time, which is more typically characterised as Presbyterian.

Such a comparison of these two standpoints is neither exclusively religious nor secular, a factor which perhaps offers some small insight as to how Lord Cork managed to achieve what seems now the extraordinary feat of gaining strong favour at various times with the leaders on either side of the English Civil War.

==Issue==
By his second wife, Catherine Fenton, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton and his wife Alice Weston, the 1st Earl of Cork had fifteen children:

*Roger Boyle (1 August 1606, Youghal, County Cork, Ireland–10 October 1615, Deptford, Kent, England, where he was buried).
*Lady Alice Boyle (1607–1667), married David Barry, 1st Earl of Barrymore, then after his death, married John Barry, of Liscarroll, co Cork, Ireland.
*Lady Sarah Boyle (1609–1633), married Sir Thomas Moore, then after his death married Robert Digby, 1st Baron Digby.
*Lady Lettice Boyle (1610–1657), married Colonel George Goring, Lord Goring.
*Lady Joan Boyle (1611–1657), married George FitzGerald, 16th Earl of Kildare (&quot;the Fairy Earl&quot;).
*Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Cork and 1st Earl of Burlington (1612–1698), Lord High Treasurer of Ireland (1660–1695).

<doc id="58186" wikidata="Q1116" url="?curid=58186" title="Antwerp Province">
<text>Antwerp Province (; ; ; ), between 1815 and 1830 known as Central Brabant ( , , ), is the northernmost province both of the Flemish Region, also called Flanders, and of Belgium. It borders on the North Brabant province of the Netherlands to the north and the Belgian provinces of Limburg, Flemish Brabant and East Flanders. Its capital is Antwerp, which includes the Port of Antwerp, the second-largest seaport in Europe. It has an area of , and with over 1.92 million inhabitants as of January 2024, is the country&#x27;s most populous province. The province consists of three arrondissements: Antwerp, Mechelen and Turnhout. The eastern part of the province comprises the main part of the Campine region.

==History==
During the early Middle Ages the region was part of the Frankish Empire, which was divided into several &quot;pagi&quot;. The territory of the present-day province belonged to several &quot;pagi&quot; of which the region around what would become the city of Antwerp belonged to the Pagus Renesium. The Pagus Toxandria stretched from North Brabant into the Campine region. To the south there was the Pagus Bracbatinsis and the Pagus Hasbaniensis. In 843 the Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne was divided among his sons and the river Scheldt became the border between West Francia and East Francia. In 974 Otto II established the Margraviate of Antwerp as a defence against the County of Flanders.
In 1106, Henry V granted the Margraviate to Godfrey I of Leuven. His descendants would from 1235 onwards become the Dukes of Brabant and the region itself was the northern part of the Duchy of Brabant. In 1430 the Duchy became part of the Duchy of Burgundy until 1477 when it fell to the House of Habsburg. In 1713, at the end of the Spanish Succession War the region became part of the Austrian Netherlands until 1794, with in 1790 the short lived United States of Belgium. On 1 October 1795 the former Austrian Netherlands were annexed by France under the French Directory.

The modern province was created as the &quot;Department of the two Netes&quot; during the First French Empire (when the Southern Netherlands were part of France). After the defeat of Napoleon, the territory became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands as the province of Central Brabant, distinguishing it from North Brabant and South Brabant. In 1830, after Belgium&#x27;s independence the province was renamed Antwerp (after its major city and capital).

==Transportation==
The province has a network of roads, railroads, canals and rivers which provide a modern infrastructure. Historically, the traffic infrastructure was an important element of connecting the Port of Antwerp with the Ruhr Area in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Both the Iron Rhine railroad and the E313 (&quot;King Baudouin highway&quot;) and E34 highway connect Antwerp with the Ruhr Area.

Of the International E-road network, the E313, E19, and E34 run through parts of the province. The Kennedy Tunnel and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel connect the highway network of the province with East Flanders and Ghent. In addition a new Oosterweelconnection is under consideration.

The railroads connect the major cities of the province, such as Antwerp, Mechelen, Herentals, Turnhout and Mol. The Iron Rhine connects Antwerp with Mönchengladbach in Germany. The new High Speed Train connects Antwerpen-Centraal railway station with Brussels (HSL 4) and Amsterdam (HSL-Zuid) at high speed. Antwerp International Airport, located in Deurne, is a regional airport.

The river Schelde, an important waterway, connects the Port of Antwerp with the North Sea. The Albert Canal connects the Scheldt in Antwerp with the Meuse and Liège. Other canals are the Canal Dessel – Kwaadmechelen, Schoten – Turnhout – Dessel, and Herentals – Bocholt which flows into the Nete canal.

==Tourism==

The province contains several historical cities, such as Antwerp, Mechelen, Turnhout, Herentals and Lier. The Campine region is becoming a popular destination for tourists searching for a quiet and relaxed weekend. Old farms were transformed into bed and breakfast-hotels, the restaurant and café business is very active and an ingenious network for bicycle tours has come to life in recent years. Here and there are still areas of large heathland - and forests, such as the Kalmthoutse Heide (E: Kalmthout heathland) in Kalmthout, the moors around Turnhout, the &quot;Liereman&quot; (Oud-Turnhout) and the &quot;Prinsenpark&quot; in Retie. In a number of villages one can still see the typical Campine &quot;langgevelboerderijen&quot; (E: &quot;long facade farms&quot;).

==Education and research==
The province is home to several educational institutions and the University of Antwerp. Several research institutions are located in the province, such as the SCK•CEN, the European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO).

International schools in Antwerp include Antwerp International School and Lycée Français International d&#x27;Anvers.

==Economy==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 88 billion € in 2018. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €41,900 or 139% of the EU27 average in the same year.

The Port of Antwerp is the economic heart of the province. Until the agricultural crisis of 1880, the eastern part of the province was a largely agricultural region. The industrial development of the eastern part of the province, part of the Campine region, started at the end of the 19th century when industry established itself in the region. The availability of cheap labor, new roads, canals, tramways and railroads such as the Iron Rhine, stimulated the settlement of new industry. A brickmaking industry was established alongside the canals, paper and printing business in Turnhout, as were non-ferrous metallurgy in Balen-Nete, dynamite factories in Arendonk and Balen, tobacco and cigar factories in Arendonk, and the first shoe factory in Herentals. During the 1920s, the industrial expansion of the region continued with the radium and copper factories in Olen, the glass factory in Mol-Gompel and the diamond industry in Grobbendonk and Nijlen.

In the 20th century the first nuclear installation in Belgium was established at the SCK•CEN in Mol in 1962. The European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM), one of the EU Joint Research Centres, was founded in Geel in 1957 as a result of the Treaty of Rome. Innotek is a technology centre located in Geel and is part of the European Business and Innovation Centre Network (EBN). Industry in the Campine region of the province is mainly located alongside the E313, the E34 and the Albert Canal.

=== Unemployment ===
The unemployment rate stood at 5.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.
===Chemical industry===
After World War II the Port of Antwerp was expanded, and on its premises several chemical factories and oil refineries were established, including facilities of Bayer, BASF, and Monsanto. The chemical and petrochemical industry is widely represented in the port region and comprises the world&#x27;s second-largest cluster petrochemical industry cluster, after that of Houston (United States). Amoco Chemical Belgium N.V., now part of BP, was founded in Geel in 1967.

A pharmaceutical industry was founded in Beerse in the 1960s, with Janssen Pharmaceutica and more recently with Genzyme in Geel. Soudal (silicon) in Turnhout and Ravago (plastics) in Arendonk became leading companies in their markets.

===Diamond===
The diamond industry and trade is traditionally located in Antwerp. At the end of the 19th century Hendrik Cassiers founded a diamond-cutting company outside Antwerp, in Grobbendonk. Hendrik Cassiers and Frans Dela Montagne laid the foundations of the diamond industry in the Campine region. The industry would settle in Nijlen, Herenthout, Bevel, Kessel, Vorselaar and Berlaar.

===Paper===
The region around Turnhout became famous for its printing business, with companies such as Brepols, which roots date back to 1796 when Pieter Corbeels established his printing business in Turnhout. In 1833, Van Genechten N.V., Splichal N.V. in 1856, Mesmaekers Freres in 1859, Meses-Goris in 1872, L. Biermans in 1875, Poupaert in 1881, La Belgica N.V. in 1907, H. Proost &amp; Co in 1913, J. Van Mierlo-Proost in 1918, Lityca in 1932 and Veloutex in 1951. More recently in 1970, Cartamundi was established, a world leader in playing cards.

===Metallurgies===
While Wallonia was famous for its steel industry, the Campine region became renowned for its non-ferrous metallurgies. The Campine region was scarcely populated in the 19th century, but with the establishment of canals, the Iron Rhine and cheap labor, several metallurgies were established in the region. In 1888-1889 the metallurgy La Vieille Montagne was founded in Balen-Nete, close to the Iron Rhine and the canal to Beverlo. The company had its roots in the exploitation of the zinc mines of Moresnet.

The Union Minière du Haut Katanga founded the Société Générale Métallurgique de Hoboken in Olen, which was established along the Iron Rhine and the Albert Canal. The factory produced radium, cobalt and copper from the mines of the Union Minière in Katanga, Belgian Congo and Rhodesia. Along the canal Turnhout-Schoten, the Métallurgique de la Campine was established in 1910 for the production of lead and antimony. La Metallo-Chimique was established in 1919; this specialized in the production of copper.

===Glass===
In 1872, the Sablières et Carrières Réunies (SCR), now Sibelco, was founded to extract the silica sand layers in Mol for industrial applications (glass). In 1920 the glass bottle manufacturer Beles Réunios was set up in Mol-Donk.

In 1921, a group of Belgian banks, the Mutuelle Mobilière &amp; Immobilière, the Société Générale de Belgique, the Banque de Bruxelles and the Financière de Transport, together with the American group Libbey-Owens, founded the Cie Internationale pour la fabrication mécanique de Verre in Mol Gompel. In 1931, due to the economic crisis, the company merged into Glaces et Verres (Glaver). In 1961, Glaver merged with Univerbel to form Glaverbel.

===Dynamite===
Given that the Campine region was sparsely populated, several dynamite factories were established in the region. In 1875, the Societe Anonyme d&#x27;Arendonk was established which premises would later become part of Ravago. In 1881 La Forcite N.V. was established near Balen, which was later acquired in 1920 by the Poudreries Réunies de Belgique (PRB). In 1887 a factory was founded near Herentals, which was closed due to the vicinity to the city. The factories produced explosives for the mines and quarries. The factories in the province are now closed down.

===Textiles===
Historically, wool processing industry was based on the wool from the sheep which were kept on the Campine heath. The centre of the textile industry in the province could be found in Turnhout. Wool processing companies such as Wolspinnerij Van Iersel, Spinnerij en Weverij Van Hoof, and De Wollendekensfabriek Van Doren were located in Mol.

===Tobacco===
At the end of the 19th century Arendonk became the centre of the tobacco industry. Additional factories were founded in Turnhout, Mol, Geel and Herentals. After World War II, the ALTO cigar factory was founded by Frans Van den Bergh who would also play an important role at Janssen Pharmaceutica.

==Administrative subdivisions==

The province is divided into three administrative arrondissements (&quot;arrondissementen&quot; in Dutch) containing 69 municipalities (numbers refer to the location of the municipalities on the map shown in this section):

<doc id="58193" wikidata="Q747" url="?curid=58193" title="Pierre Corneille">
<text>Pierre Corneille (; ; 6 June 1606 – 1 October 1684) was a French tragedian. He is generally considered one of the three great 17th-century French dramatists, along with Molière and Racine.

As a young man, he earned the valuable patronage of Cardinal Richelieu, who was trying to promote classical tragedy along formal lines, but later quarrelled with him, especially over his best-known play, &quot;Le Cid&quot;, about a medieval Spanish warrior, which was denounced by the newly formed for breaching the unities. He continued to write well-received tragedies for nearly forty years.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Corneille was born in Rouen, Normandy, France, to Marthe Le Pesant and Pierre Corneille, a distinguished lawyer. His younger brother, Thomas Corneille, also became a noted playwright. He was given a rigorous Jesuit education at the &quot;Collège de Bourbon&quot; (Lycée Pierre-Corneille since 1873), where acting on the stage was part of the training. At 18 he began to study law, but his practical legal endeavours were largely unsuccessful. Corneille&#x27;s father secured two magisterial posts for him with the Rouen department of Forests and Rivers. During his time with the department, he wrote his first play. It is unknown exactly when he wrote it, but the play, the comedy &quot;Mélite&quot;, surfaced when Corneille brought it to a group of traveling actors in 1629. The actors approved of the work and made it part of their repertoire. The play was a success in Paris, and Corneille began writing plays on a regular basis. He moved to Paris in the same year and soon became one of the leading playwrights of the French stage. His early comedies, starting with &quot;Mélite&quot;, depart from the French farce tradition by reflecting the elevated language and manners of fashionable Parisian society. Corneille describes his variety of comedy as &quot;une peinture de la conversation des honnêtes gens&quot; (&quot;a painting of the conversation of the gentry&quot;). His first true tragedy is &quot;Médée&quot;, produced in 1635.
The year 1634 brought more attention to Corneille. He was selected to write verses for Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s visit to Rouen. The Cardinal took notice of Corneille and selected him to be among &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Five Poets&quot;; also translated as &quot;the society of the five authors&quot;). The others were Guillaume Colletet, Boisrobert, Jean Rotrou, and Claude de L&#x27;Estoile.

The five were selected to realize Richelieu&#x27;s vision of a new kind of drama that emphasized virtue. Richelieu would present ideas, which the writers would express in dramatic form. However, the Cardinal&#x27;s demands were too restrictive for Corneille, who attempted to innovate outside the boundaries defined by Richelieu. This led to contention between playwright and employer. After his initial contract ended, Corneille left &quot;&quot; and returned to Rouen.

===&quot;Querelle du Cid&quot;===
In the years directly following this break with Richelieu, Corneille produced what is considered his finest play. &quot;Le Cid&quot; is based on the play &quot;Mocedades del Cid&quot; (1621) by Guillem de Castro. Both plays were based on the legend of Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (nicknamed &quot;El Cid Campeador&quot;), a military figure in Medieval Spain.
The original 1637 edition of the play was subtitled a tragicomedy, acknowledging that it intentionally defies the classical tragedy/comedy distinction. Even though &quot;Le Cid&quot; was an enormous popular success, it was the subject of a heated argument over the norms of dramatic practice, known as the &quot;Querelle du Cid&quot; or &quot;The Quarrel of Le Cid&quot;. Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s acknowledged the play&#x27;s success, but determined that it was defective, in part because it did not respect the classical unities of time, place, and action (Unity of Time stipulated that all the action in a play must take place within a 24-hour time-frame; Unity of Place, that there must be only one setting for the action; and Unity of Action, that the plot must be centred on a single conflict or problem). The newly formed &quot;Académie&quot; was a body that asserted state control over cultural activity. Although it usually dealt with efforts to standardize the French language, Richelieu himself ordered an analysis of &quot;Le Cid&quot;.

Accusations of immorality were leveled at the play in the form of a famous pamphlet campaign. These attacks were founded on the classical theory that the theatre was a site of moral instruction. The Académie&#x27;s recommendations concerning the play are articulated in Jean Chapelain&#x27;s &quot;Sentiments de l&#x27;Académie française sur la tragi-comédie du Cid&quot; (1638). Even the prominent writer Georges de Scudéry harshly criticized the play in his &quot;Observations sur le Cid&quot; (1637). The intensity of this &quot;war of pamphlets&quot; was heightened severely by Corneille&#x27;s boastful poem Excuse À Ariste, in which he rambled and boasted about his talents and claimed that no other author could be a rival. These poems and pamphlets were made public, one after the other, as once &quot;esteemed&quot; playwrights traded slanderous blows. At one point, Corneille took several shots at criticizing author Jean Mairet&#x27;s family and lineage. Scudéry, a close friend of Mairet at the time, did not stoop to Corneille&#x27;s level of &quot;distastefulness&quot;, but instead continued to pillory &quot;Le Cid&quot; and its violations. Scudéry even stated of &quot;Le Cid&quot; that, &quot;almost all of the beauty which the play contains is plagiarized.&quot;

This &quot;war of pamphlets&quot; eventually influenced Richelieu to call upon the Académie française to analyze the play. In their final conclusions, the academy ruled that even though Corneille had attempted to remain loyal to the unity of time, &quot;Le Cid&quot; broke too many of the unities to be a valued piece of work.

The controversy, coupled with the academy&#x27;s ruling proved too much for Corneille, who decided to return to Rouen. When one of his plays was reviewed unfavorably, Corneille was known to withdraw from public life. He remained publicly silent for some time; privately, however, he was said to be &quot;troubled and obsessed by the issues, making numerous revisions to the play.&quot;

===Response to the &quot;Querelle du Cid&quot;===
After a hiatus from the theater, Corneille returned in 1640. The &quot;Querelle du Cid&quot; caused Corneille to pay closer attention to classical dramatic rules. This was evident in his next plays, which were classical tragedies, &quot;Horace&quot; (1640, dedicated to Richelieu), &quot;Cinna&quot; (1643), and &quot;Polyeucte&quot; (1643). These three plays and &quot;Le Cid&quot; are collectively known as Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Classical Tetralogy&quot;. Corneille also responded to the criticisms of the Académie by making multiple revisions to &quot;Le Cid&quot; to make it closer to the conventions of classical tragedy. The 1648, 1660, and 1682 editions were no longer subtitled &quot;tragicomedy&quot;, but &quot;tragedy&quot;.

Corneille&#x27;s popularity grew and by the mid-1640s, the first collection of his plays was published. Corneille married Marie de Lampérière in 1641. They had seven children together. In the mid to late 1640s, Corneille produced mostly tragedies, &quot;La Mort de Pompée&quot; (&quot;The Death of Pompey&quot;, performed 1644), &quot;Rodogune&quot; (performed 1645), &quot;Théodore&quot; (performed 1646), and &quot;Héraclius&quot; (performed 1647). He also wrote one comedy in this period, &quot;Le Menteur&quot; (&quot;The Liar&quot;, 1644).

In 1652, the play &quot;Pertharite&quot; met with poor critical reviews and a disheartened Corneille decided to quit the theatre. He began to focus on an influential verse translation of &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; by Thomas à Kempis, which he completed in 1656. After an absence of nearly eight years, Corneille was persuaded to return to the stage in 1659. He wrote the play &quot;Oedipe&quot;, which was favored by Louis XIV. In the next year, Corneille published &quot;Trois discours sur le poème dramatique&quot; (&quot;Three Discourses on Dramatic Poetry&quot;), which were, in part, defenses of his style. These writings can be seen as Corneille&#x27;s response to the &quot;Querelle du Cid&quot;. He simultaneously maintained the importance of classical dramatic rules and justified his own transgressions of those rules in &quot;Le Cid&quot;. Corneille argued the Aristotelian dramatic guidelines were not meant to be subject to a strict literal reading. Instead, he suggested that they were open to interpretation. Although the relevance of classical rules was maintained, Corneille suggested that the rules should not be so tyrannical that they stifle innovation.

===Later plays===
Even though Corneille was prolific after his return to the stage, writing one play a year for the 14 years after 1659, his later plays did not have the same success as those of his earlier career. Other writers were beginning to gain popularity. In 1670 Corneille and Jean Racine, one of his dramatic rivals, were challenged to write plays on the same incident. Each playwright was unaware that the challenge had also been issued to the other. When both plays were completed, it was generally acknowledged that Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Tite et Bérénice&quot; (1671) was inferior to Racine&#x27;s play (&quot;Bérénice&quot;). Molière was also prominent at the time and Corneille even composed the comedy &quot;Psyché&quot; (1671) in collaboration with him (and Philippe Quinault). Most of the plays that Corneille wrote after his return to the stage were tragedies. They included &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Golden Fleece&quot;, 1660), &quot;Sertorius&quot; (1662), &quot;Othon&quot; (1664), &quot;Agésilas&quot; (1666), and &quot;Attila&quot; (1667).

He wrote his last piece &quot;Suréna&quot; in 1674; it was a complete failure. After this, he retired from the stage for the final time and died at his home in Paris in 1684. His grave in the Église Saint-Roch went without a monument until 1821.

== Legacy ==
The dramatist, author and philosopher Voltaire created, with the support of the Académie française, a twelve-volume annotated set of Corneille&#x27;s dramatic works, the &quot;Commentaires sur Corneille&quot;. It was Voltaire&#x27;s largest ever work of literary criticism. Voltaire&#x27;s proposal to the Académie described Corneille as doing for the French language what Homer had done for Greek: showing the world that it could be a medium for great art. Voltaire was driven to defend classic French literature in the face of increasingly popular foreign influences such as William Shakespeare. This is reflected in the first edition of the &quot;Commentaires&quot;, published in 1764, which focused on Corneille&#x27;s better works and had relatively muted criticisms. By the second edition, published ten years later, Voltaire had come to a more negative assessment of Corneille and a stronger view on the need for objective criticism. He added five hundred critical notes, covering more works and taking a more negative tone.
Critics&#x27; opinions of Corneille were already highly polarised. Voltaire&#x27;s intervention polarised the debate further and some critics saw his criticisms as pedantic and driven by envy. In the 19th century, the tide of opinion turned against Voltaire. Napoleon expressed a preference for Corneille over Voltaire, reviving the former&#x27;s reputation as a dramatist while diminishing the latter&#x27;s.

In Episode 31 of the 1989 video lecture series, “The Western Tradition”, UCLA Professor Eugen Weber offers further commentary on Mssr. Corneille&#x27;s work:

&quot;But remember that Corneille’s plays were directed to an aristocracy that couldn’t be touched by sermons, by moralizing, by sentimentalism. So he touched them by showing the greatness of self-discipline and self-denial, of not doing what you &quot;want&quot;, but what you &quot;should&quot; do. And note that Corneille didn’t say, as a Christian would, that doing your duty makes you &quot;good&quot;, he said that doing your duty makes you &quot;great&quot;. When Corneille presented the struggle between passion and duty, it wasn’t a new invention. What was new in Corneille was that he showed one legitimate passion opposed to another passion that was equally legitimate. It was important to elevate the debate from a contest between right and wrong to a contest between two rights. Because a gentleman who got into a fight could not admit that he was wrong, but if you started by stipulating that his motives were honorable, he would at least stop to consider your argument, which is what Corneille achieved by raising the debate to a higher plane. And the seventeenth-century people who loved his adventure stories felt vaguely that they were getting in them something they hadn’t quite known before. And they were right. They hadn’t known it before for the simple reason that it had gone out with the Greeks. Roman thought was too legalistic, Christian thought was too simplistic to tolerate the idea that there could be two rights, that there could be two sides to a conflict. This is a very sophisticated view, and it is only fit for very sophisticated minds. And the tiny minority of the seventeenth-century society that read Corneille, that saw Corneille’s plays, was hardly very sophisticated, but it was beginning to try at least.&quot;

<doc id="58198" wikidata="Q27645" url="?curid=58198" title="Mikhail Bakunin">
<text>Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin ( ; – 1 July 1876) was a Russian revolutionary anarchist. He is among the most influential figures of anarchism and a major figure in the revolutionary socialist, social anarchist, and collectivist anarchist traditions. Bakunin&#x27;s prestige as a revolutionary also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.

Bakunin grew up in Pryamukhino, a family estate in Tver Governorate. From 1840, he studied in Moscow, then in Berlin hoping to enter academia. Later in Paris, he met Karl Marx and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who deeply influenced him. Bakunin&#x27;s increasing radicalism ended hopes of a professorial career. He was expelled from France for opposing the Russian Empire&#x27;s occupation of Poland. After participating in the 1848 Prague and 1849 Dresden uprisings, Bakunin was imprisoned, tried, sentenced to death, and extradited multiple times. Finally exiled to Siberia in 1857, he escaped via Japan to the United States and then to London, where he worked with Alexander Herzen on the journal &quot;Kolokol&quot; (&quot;The Bell&quot;). In 1863, Bakunin left to join the insurrection in Poland, but he failed to reach it and instead spent time in Switzerland and Italy.

In 1868, Bakunin joined the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, leading the anarchist faction to rapidly grow in influence. The 1872 Hague Congress was dominated by a struggle between Bakunin and Marx, who was a key figure in the General Council of the International and argued for the use of the state to bring about socialism. In contrast, Bakunin and the anarchist faction argued for the replacement of the state by federations of self-governing workplaces and communes. Bakunin could not reach the Netherlands, and the anarchist faction lost the debate in his absence. Bakunin was expelled from the International for maintaining, in Marx&#x27;s view, a secret organisation within the International, and founded the Anti-Authoritarian International in 1872. From 1870 until his death in 1876, Bakunin wrote his longer works such as &quot;Statism and Anarchy&quot; and &quot;God and the State&quot;, but he continued to directly participate in European worker and peasant movements. In 1870, he was involved in an insurrection in Lyon, France. Bakunin sought to take part in an anarchist insurrection in Bologna, Italy, but his declining health forced him to return to Switzerland in disguise.

Bakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism, an opponent of Marxism, especially of the dictatorship of the proletariat; and for his predictions that Marxist regimes would be one-party dictatorships ruling over the proletariat, not rule by the proletariat. His book &quot;God and the State&quot; has been widely translated and remains in print. Bakunin has had a significant influence on thinkers such as Peter Kropotkin, Errico Malatesta, Herbert Marcuse, E. P. Thompson, Neil Postman and A. S. Neill as well as syndicalist organizations such as the IWW, the anarchists in the Spanish Civil War and contemporary anarchists involved in the modern-day anti-globalization movement.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===

On , Mikhail Aleksandrovich Bakunin was born into Russian nobility. His family&#x27;s Priamukhino estate, in the Tver region northwest of Moscow, had over 500 serfs. His father, Alexander Mikhailovich Bakunin, was a Russian diplomat who had served in Italy. Upon returning to Priamukhino and marrying the much younger Varvara Aleksandrovna Muravyeva, the elder Bakunin raised his ten children in the Rousseauan pedagogic model. Mikhail Bakunin, their third child and oldest son, read the languages, literature, and philosophy of the period and described his youth as idyllic and sheltered from the realities of Russian life. As an early teenager, he began training for a military career at the St. Petersburg Artillery School, which he rejected. Becoming an officer in 1833, he availed himself of the freedom to participate in the city&#x27;s social life, but was unfulfilled. Derelict in his studies, he was sent to Belarus and Lithuania as punishment in early 1834, where he read academic theory and philosophy. He deserted the school in 1835 and only escaped arrest through his familial influence. He was discharged at the end of the year and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, left for Moscow to pursue a career as a mathematics teacher.

Bakunin lived a bohemian, intellectual life in Moscow, where German Romantic literature and idealist philosophy were influential in the 1830s. In the intellectual circle of Nikolai Stankevich, Bakunin read German philosophy, from Kant to Fichte to Hegel, and published Russian translations of their works. Bakunin produced the first Russian translation of Hegel and was the foremost Russian expert on Hegel by 1837. Bakunin befriended Russian intellectuals including the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky, the poet Nikolay Ogarev, the novelist Ivan Turgenev, and the writer Alexander Herzen as youth prior to their careers. Herzen funded Bakunin to study at the University of Berlin in 1840. Bakunin&#x27;s plans to return to Moscow as a professor were soon abandoned.

In Berlin, Bakunin gravitated towards the Young Hegelians, an intellectual group with radical interpretations of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, and who drew Bakunin to political topics. He left Berlin in early 1842 for Dresden and met the Hegelian Arnold Ruge, who published Bakunin&#x27;s first original publication. (&quot;The Reaction in Germany&quot;) proposes a continuation of the French Revolution to the rest of Europe and Russia. Though steeped in Hegelian jargon and published under a pseudonym, it marked Bakunin&#x27;s transition from philosophy to revolutionary rhetoric.

=== Revolutionary activity and imprisonment ===
Throughout the 1840s, Bakunin grew into revolutionary agitation. When his cadre aroused interest from Russian secret agents, Bakunin left for Zürich in early 1843. He met the proto-communist Wilhelm Weitling whose arrest led Bern&#x27;s Russian embassy to distrust Bakunin. Defying Russian orders to return, the Russian Senate stripped him of his rights as a nobleman and sentenced him in absentia to penal labor in Siberia. Without steady financial support, Bakunin became an itinerant, traveling Europe meeting the people who had influenced him. He visited Brussels and Paris, where he joined international emigrants and socialists, befriended the anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and met the philosopher Karl Marx, with whom he would later tussle. Bakunin only became personally active in political agitation in 1847, as Polish emigrants in Paris invited him to commemorate the 1830 Polish uprising with a speech. His call for Poles to overthrow czarism in alliance with Russian democrats made Bakunin known throughout Europe and led the Russian ambassador to successfully request Bakunin&#x27;s deportation.

When the French King Louis Philippe I abdicated during the February 1848 Revolution, Bakunin returned to Paris and basked in the revolutionary milieu. With the French government&#x27;s support, he headed to Prussian Poland to agitate for revolt against Russia but never arrived. He attended the 1848 Prague Slavic Congress to defend Slavic rights against German and Hungarian nationalism, and participated in its impromptu insurrection against the Austrian Habsburgs. Uncaptured, he wrote &quot;Aufruf an die Slaven&quot; (&quot;Appeal to the Slavs&quot;) at the end of the year, advocating for a Slavic federation and revolt against the Austrian, Prussian, Turkish, and Russian governments. It was widely read and translated.

After participating in both the Prague uprising and the 1849 Dresden uprising, Bakunin was imprisoned, tried, sentenced to death, extradited multiple times, and ultimately placed in solitary confinement in the Peter and Paul Fortress of St. Petersberg, Russia, in 1851. Three years later, he transferred to Shlisselburg Fortress near St. Petersberg for another three years. Prison weathered but did not break Bakunin, who retained his revolutionary zeal through his release. He did, however, write an autobiographical, genuflecting &quot;Confession&quot; to the Russian emperor, which proved to be a controversial document upon its public discovery some 70 years later. The letter did not improve his prison conditions. In 1857, Bakunin was permitted to transfer to permanent exile in Siberia. He married Antonia Kwiatkowska there before escaping in 1861, first to Japan, then to San Francisco, sailing to Panama and then to New York and Boston, and arrived in London by the end of the year. Bakunin set foot in America just as the Civil War was breaking out. Speaking with supporters of both sides, Bakunin stated that his sympathies were with the North, although he claimed hypocrisy in their stated goal of slave liberation while also forcing the South to remain in the Union. Bakunin also viewed the Southern political system and agrarian character as freer in some respects for its white citizens than in the industrial North. Though a fierce critic and enemy of slavery, Bakunin held a deep admiration for the United States as a whole, referring to the country as “the finest political organization that ever existed in history.”

=== Back in Europe ===

In London, Bakunin reunited with Herzen and Ogarev. Bakunin collaborated with them on their Russian-language newspaper but his revolutionary fervor exceeded their moderate reform agenda. Bakunin&#x27;s 1862 pamphlet &quot;The People″s Cause: Romanov, Pugachev, or Pestel?&quot; criticized the Russian tsar for not using his position to facilitate a bloodless revolution and forgo another Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion. In early August 1862, he briefly travelled to Paris. In Paris at this time, famous photographer Nadar took four famous photographs of him on August 7, 1862. After being photographed, he also signed Nadar&#x27;s &quot;Livre d&#x27;Or&quot; (autograph albume), wrote that (leaf 161): &quot;Watch out that liberty doesn&#x27;t come to you from the north.&quot; In 1863, Bakunin joined in an unsuccessful effort to supply armed men for the Polish January Uprising against Russia. Bakunin, reunited with his wife, moved to Italy the next year, where they stayed for three years.

Bakunin, in his early 50s, developed his core anarchist thoughts in Italy. He continued to refine these ideas in his remaining 12 years. Among this ideology was the first of many conspiratorial revolutionary societies, though none of these participated in revolutionary actions, chiefly the revolutionary toppling of the state, to be replaced by free federation between voluntarily associated economic producers.

He moved to Switzerland in 1867, a more permissive environment for revolutionary literature. Bakunin&#x27;s anarchist writings were fragmentary and prolific. With France&#x27;s collapse in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, Bakunin traveled to Lyon and participated in the fruitless Lyon Commune in which the citizens briefly occupied the city hall. Bakunin retreated to Switzerland.

In Switzerland, the Russian revolutionary Sergey Nechayev sought out Bakunin for a collaboration. Not knowing Nechayev&#x27;s past betrayals, Bakunin warmed to Nechayev&#x27;s revolutionary zeal and they together produced the 1869 &quot;Catechism of the Revolutionary&quot;, a tract that endorsed an ascetic life for revolutionaries without societal or moral bonds. Bakunin&#x27;s connection with Nechayev hurt the former&#x27;s reputation. More recent scholarship, however, challenges the catechism&#x27;s authorship, crediting Nechayev as the primary or sole author. Bakunin ultimately disavowed their connection.

=== First International ===

While Bakunin encountered Karl Marx in Paris (1844) and London (1864), he came to know him through the First International (International Working Men&#x27;s Association), which Marx and Friedrich Engels formed in the 1860s. Bakunin&#x27;s relationship with Marx became strained in the early 1870s for both interpersonal and ideological differences. Bakunin respected Marx&#x27;s erudition and passion for socialism but found his personality to be authoritarian and arrogant. In turn, Marx was skeptical towards Russian reactionism and Bakunin&#x27;s unruliness. As Bakunin developed his anarchist ideas in this period, he came to see federative social organization, led by the peasantry and poorest workers, as the primary post-revolution goal, whereas Marx believed in a dictatorship of the proletariat, led by organized workers in industrially advanced countries, in which the workers use state infrastructure until the state withers away. Bakunists abhorred the political organization for which Marx advocated.

Marx had Bakunin and Bakunist anarchists ejected from the First International&#x27;s 1872 Hague Congress. This breaking point split the Marxist socialist movement from the anarchist movement and led to the undoing of the International. Bakunin&#x27;s ideas continued to spread nevertheless to the labor movement in Spain and the watchmakers of the Swiss Jura Federation.

Bakunin wrote his last major work, &quot;Statism and Anarchy&quot; (1873), anonymously in Russian to stir underground revolution in Russia. It restates his anarchist position, establishes the German Empire as the foremost centralized state in opposition to European anarchism, likens Marx to German authoritarianism, and warns of Marx&#x27;s dictatorship of the proletariat being led by autocrats for their own gain in the name of the proletariat. This premonition furthered the gulf between the Marxists and Bakunist anarchists.

In one final revolutionary act, Bakunin planned the unsuccessful 1874 Bologna insurrection with his Italian followers. Its failure was a major setback to the Italian anarchist movement. Bakunin retreated to Switzerland, where he retired, dying in Bern on 1 July 1876.

== Thought ==

Much of Bakunin&#x27;s writings on anarchism reflects antipathy for the state and &quot;political organization itself as the source of oppression and exploitation&quot;. His revolutionary solutions focus on undoing the state and hierarchical religious, social, and economic institutions, to be replaced by a system of freely federated communes organized &quot;from below upward&quot; with voluntary associations of economic producers, starting locally but ostensibly organizing internationally. These thoughts were first published in his unfinished 1871 &quot;The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution&quot;, expanded by a second part published in his 1908 &quot;Oeuvres&quot;, and again elaborated a fragment found and published posthumously as &quot;God and the State&quot; (1882). The latter was his most famous work, translated widely, and a touchstone of anarchist literature. It appeals to cast off both the state and religion to realize man&#x27;s inborn freedom.

Bakunin&#x27;s core political thought addressed emancipatory communities in which members freely develop their abilities and faculties without overpowering each other. Participation within community was a personal concern of his, and his vision of a community&#x27;s role in creating free and happy humans stemmed from his close sibling relationships. Bakunin unsuccessfully sought community in religion and philosophy through influences including Arnold Ruge (Left Hegelianism), Ludwig Feuerbach (philosophical humanism), Wilhelm Weitling (proto-communism), and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (early anarchism). Bakunin turned from metaphysics and theory to the practice of creating communities of free, independent people. His first attempts at this, with the Polish emigrants and Prague Slav Congress in the 1840s, focused on national liberation, but he turned to emancipatory community after the failed 1863 Polish naval expedition. For Bakunin, freedom required community (such that humanity could only be free if everyone was free) and equality (that all people have the same starting basis), including equality in rights and social functions for women.

He envisioned an international revolution by the awakened masses that would bring about new forms of social organization (by committees of delegates and independent municipalities) in a large-scale federation undoing all state structure and social coercion. In this emancipated community, every adult would be entitled freedom, to be governed by their own conscience and reason according to their own will, responsible foremost to themselves and then to their community. He did not believe a reformed bourgeois or revolutionary state could emancipate like such a community he described, so his vision of revolution meant not capturing power but ensuring that no new power took the place of the old.

Bakunin was not a systematic thinker and did not design grand systems or theoretical constructs. His writing was prolific and fragmented. He was prone to large digressions and rarely completed what he set out to address. As a result, much of his writings on anarchism do not cohere and were published only posthumously. Bakunin did develop his theoretical perspective through draft programs. Bakunin first called himself an anarchist in 1867.

=== Authority ===

Bakunin saw the institutions of church and state as standing against the aims of emancipatory community, namely that they impose wisdom and justice from above under the pretense that the masses could not fully self-govern. He wrote that &quot;to exploit and to govern mean the same thing&quot;. Bakunin held the State as a regulated system of domination and exploitation by a privileged, ruling class. This applied to States both historical and contemporaneous, including modern monarchies and republics that each used military and bureaucratic centralization. He regarded representative democracies as a paradoxical abstraction from social reality. Although a popular legislature is meant to represent the will of the people, he saw it rarely function as such in practice. Elected politicians instead represented abstractions. Bakunin believed that powerful institutions to be inherently stronger than individual will and incapable of internal reform due to the overwhelming ambitions and temptations that corrupt those with power. To Bakunin, anarchists were rightly &quot;enemies of all power, knowing that power corrupts those invested with it just as much as those compelled to submit to it&quot;.

Bakunin clashed with Marx over worker governance and revolutionary change. Bakunin argued that even the best revolutionary placed on the Russian throne would become worse than Czar Alexander. Bakunin wrote that socialist workers in power would become ex-workers who govern by their own pretensions, not representing the people. Bakunin did not believe in transitional dictatorship serving any purpose other than to perpetuate itself, saying that &quot;liberty without socialism is privilege and injustice, and socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality&quot;. Bakunin disagreed with Marx that the state would wither away under worker ownership and that worker conquest and changes in production conditions would inherently kill the state. Bakunin promoted spontaneous worker actions over Marx&#x27;s suggested organization of a working-class party.

While Bakunin believed that science and specialists could be useful in enlightening communities, he did not believe in government by experts or letting any privileged minority rule over a majority or any presumed intelligence rule over a presumed stupidity. Bakunin wrote of referring to the &quot;authority to the bootmaker&quot; on boots and to savants for their specialties, and listening to them freely in respect for their expertise, but not allowing the bootmaker or the savant to impose this authority and not letting them be beyond criticism or censure. Bakunin believed that authority should be in continual voluntary exchange rather than a constant subordination. He believed intelligence to have intrinsic benefits so as to not require additional privileges.

=== Revolutionary societies ===

Towards the end of his life, beginning in 1864 in Italy with the International Brotherhood, Bakunin attempted to unite his international network under secret revolutionary societies, a concept at odds with his professed caution against the autocratic tendencies of the revolutionary elite. Composed of Bakunin&#x27;s circle, these informal groups existed mainly on paper and thus did not participate in revolutionary action or bridge revolutionary theory to practice like Bakunin intended. The groups operated with significant autonomy, having diverged from Bakunin on multiple controversial issues. Despite being cast at the Hague Congress as under Bakunin&#x27;s stern authority, they were organized by personal relationships rather than the vertical hierarchies and membership ranks found in Bakunin&#x27;s notes. His written programs played a larger role in his politics than these draft secret societies.

The idea of the &quot;invisible dictatorship&quot; was central to Bakunin&#x27;s politics. In combination with Bakunin&#x27;s opposition to parliamentary politics, historian Peter Marshall wrote that such a secret party—its existence unknown and its policies beholden to none—had the potential for greater tyranny than a Blanquist or Marxist party and was hard to envision as presaging an open, democratic society.

== Personal life ==

Bakunin married Antonia Kwiatkowska, originally from Poland, during his exile in Siberia. Kwiatkowska was much younger than Bakunin (a difference of 26 years; she was 18) and had little interest in politics. Their differences and Bakunin&#x27;s meagre attention to romance have left biographers speculating about possible psychosexual rationales for Bakunin&#x27;s personal life and the extent of his dedication to revolutionary action. Though she remained married to Bakunin until his death in 1876, Kwiatkowska had three children with another man while Bakunin was still alive – an Italian disciple of his, who married her after Bakunin&#x27;s death.

== Legacy ==

Bakunin was the leading anarchist revolutionary of the 19th century, active from the 1840s through the 1870s. His foundational anarchist writings helped the movement stand in contrast to capitalism and Marxism and became more popular after his death, with some of his highest regarded works published posthumously and in new editions. His &quot;Statism and Anarchy&quot; influenced the growing Russian Narodnik movement of peasant socialism, and his anarchism influenced ideology in both the Russian Revolution and the Spanish Civil War. The 1960s New Left revived interest in his works and ideas of voluntary association and opposition to authoritarian socialism, with new editions and translations published.

Bakunin&#x27;s legacy reflects the paradox and ambivalence by which he lived. As historian Paul Avrich put it, Bakunin was &quot;a nobleman who yearned for a peasant revolt, a libertarian with an urge to dominate others, an intellectual with a powerful anti-intellectual streak&quot;, who professed support for unfettered liberty while demanding unconditional obedience from his followers. Many of his actions put him closer to later authoritarian movements, even if his words were anti-authoritarian.

In particular, the antisemitic passages in Bakunin&#x27;s writing have been the subject of extended interest, such that Bakunin biographer Mark Leier has said the question is raised every time he speaks on Bakunin. Both Leier and scholar of antisemitism Eirik Eiglad have commented that antisemitism was not essential to Bakunin&#x27;s thought, nor was his thought valued for his antisemitism. Sociologist Marcel Stoetzler argued the opposite, saying that the antisemitic trope of Jewish world domination was at the centre of Bakunin&#x27;s political thought. Bakunin&#x27;s anti-Jewish and anti-German resentment are most visible in the context of his attacks on Marx, but his antisemitism predated these passages. Scholar Marshall Shatz noted that there is a gap between Bakunin&#x27;s egalitarian principles and his ethnic prejudices, even if this antisemitism and stereotyping was common among French radicals of the era and shared by Marx himself.

Noam Chomsky called Bakunin&#x27;s prediction that Marxist regimes would become dictatorships &quot;one of the few predictions in the social sciences that actually came true&quot;.

Bakunin archives are held in several places: the Pushkin House, the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the Russian State Library, the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art, the National Library of Russia, and the International Institute of Social History.

<doc id="58202" wikidata="Q574641" url="?curid=58202" title="Balaam">
<text>Balaam (; ), son of Beor, was a biblical figure, a non-Israelite prophet and diviner who lived in Pethor, a place identified with the ancient city of Pitru, thought to have been located between the region of Iraq and northern Syria in what is now southeastern Turkey. According to chapters 22–24 of the Book of Numbers, he was hired by King Balak of Moab to curse Israel, but instead he blessed the Israelites, as dictated by God. Subsequently, the plan to entice the Israelites into idol worship and sexual immorality is attributed to him.
Balaam is also mentioned in the Book of Micah.

In rabbinic literature, Balaam is portrayed as a non-Jewish prophet with powers comparable to Moses but is often depicted negatively for his attempts to curse Israel, his role in leading them to sin, and his eventual execution. The Talmud comments on his significance by stating, “Moses wrote his book and the portion of Balaam” (Bava Batra 14b).

In Josephus, Philo, and Christian sources, Balaam is recognized for his exceptional divinatory abilities but is criticized for his moral failings, including greed and corruption. The New Testament condemns him as a symbol of avarice, notably in Revelation 2:14, which states, “Balaam… taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.” Islamic tradition does not mention Balaam by name in the Quran but identifies him with the figure in Surah Al-A’raf 7:175-176, who received divine knowledge but succumbed to worldly desires, leading to his downfall and depiction as a panting dog.

The Deir Alla inscription, dating to around 840–760 BCE, describes visions of Balaam, son of Beor, as a seer of multiple gods warning of impending destruction, contrasting with the biblical depiction of Balaam as a prophet of Yahweh.

==Hebrew Bible==
The main story of Balaam occurs during the sojourn of the Israelites in the plains of Moab, east of the Jordan River, at the close of forty years of wandering, shortly before the death of Moses and the crossing of the Jordan. The Israelites have already defeated two kings in Transjordan: Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan. Balak, king of Moab, consequently becomes alarmed and sends elders of Midian and his Moabite messengers, to Balaam, son of Beor, to induce him to come and curse Israel. Balaam&#x27;s location, Pethor, which is now located in the region of northern Syria and southeastern Turkey is simply given as &quot;which is by the river of the land of the children of his people&quot; in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint. The Samaritan Pentateuch, Vulgate, and Peshitta all identify his land as Ammon.


Balaam sends back word that he can only do what YHWH commands, and God has, via a nocturnal dream, told him not to go. Balak consequently sends higher-ranking priests and offers Balaam honours; Balaam continues to press God, and God finally permits him to go but with instructions to say only what He commands. Balaam then sets out in the morning with the princes of Moab. God becomes angry that he went and sends the Angel of the Lord (Numbers 22:22) to prevent him. At first, the angel is seen only by the donkey Balaam is riding, which tries to avoid the angel. After Balaam starts punishing the donkey for refusing to move, it is miraculously given the power to speak to Balaam (Numbers 22:28) and says, &quot;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?&quot; At this point, Balaam is allowed to see the angel, who informs him that the donkey&#x27;s turning away from the messenger is the only reason the angel did not kill Balaam. Balaam immediately repents, but is told to go on.

Balak meets with Balaam at Kirjat Huzoth, and they go to the &quot;high places of Baal&quot;, and offer sacrifices on seven altars, leading to Balaam being given a prophecy by Yahweh, which He speaks to Balak. However, the prophecy blesses Israel; Balak remonstrates, but Balaam reminds him that he can only speak the words put in his mouth, so Balak takes him to another &quot;high place&quot; at Pisgah, to try again. Building another seven altars here, and making sacrifices on each, Balaam provides another prophecy blessing Israel.

Balaam finally gets taken by a now very frustrated Balak to Peor, and, after the seven sacrifices there, decides not to &quot;seek enchantments&quot; but instead looks upon the Israelites from the peak. The Spirit of God comes upon Balaam and he delivers a third positive prophecy concerning Israel. Balak&#x27;s anger rises to the point where he threatens Balaam, but Balaam merely offers a prediction of fate. Balaam then looks upon the Kenites, and Amalekites and offers two more predictions of their fates. Balak and Balaam then go to their respective homes.

Later, Numbers 25:1–9 describes how Israel engaged in the Heresy of Peor. Numbers 31:16 blames this on Balaam&#x27;s advice and because of his culpability in the incident, which resulted in deadly divine judgements against the Israelites who participated, he was eventually killed in a retaliatory battle against Midian in Numbers 31:8.

Deuteronomy 23:3–6 summarises these incidents, and further states that the Ammonites were associated with the Moabites. Joshua, in his farewell speech, also makes reference to it. With God&#x27;s protection taken from him, Balaam is later listed among the Midianites who were killed in revenge for the &quot;matter of Peor&quot;. Joshua 13:22 records that Balaam died &quot;by the sword&quot; during a battle for the Reubenite occupation of Moabite land.

In total, Balaam&#x27;s prophecies consist of seven (Hebrew) poems:
* The first, Numbers 23:7–10, prophesies the unique exaltation of the Kingdom of Israel, and its countless numbers.
* The second, Numbers 23:18–24, celebrates the moral virtue of Israel, its monarchy, and its military conquests.
* The third, Numbers 24:3–9, celebrates the glory and conquests of Israel&#x27;s monarchy.
* The fourth, Numbers 24:14–19, prophesies the coming of a king who will conquer Edom and Moab.
* The fifth, Numbers 24:20, concerns the ruins of Amalek.
* The sixth, Numbers 24:21–22, concerns the destruction of the Kenites by Assyria.
* The seventh, Numbers 24:23–24, concerns &quot;ships of Kittim&quot; coming from the west to attack Assyria and Eber.

The poems fall into three groups. The first group consists of two poems which characteristically start immediately. The third group of three poems also start immediately, but are much shorter. The second group, however, consists of two poems which both start:

Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open ...

===Biblical criticism===

Of Balaam&#x27;s three groups of poems, the documentary hypothesis argued that the first and third groups originated within the Elohist text, whereas the second group belonged to the Jahwist. Thus the Elohist describes Balaam giving two blessings, making sacrifices on seven altars, at the high places of Baal, before each, then deciding not to &quot;seek enchantments&quot; after the third set of sacrifices, but to &quot;set his face upon the wilderness,&quot; which Balak views as a third blessing, and so Balaam then gives the three final predictions of fate. Conversely, in the Jahwist source, Balaam arrives, the spirit of God comes upon him, and he delivers a blessing and a prophecy in succession.

&quot;Agag&quot;, mentioned in the third poem, is described as a great king, which does not correspond to the king of the Amalekites who was named Agag, and described in 1 Samuel 15, since that description considers Amalek to be small and obscure. While the Masoretic text of the poem uses the word &quot;Agag&quot;, the Septuagint, other Greek versions, and the Samaritan Pentateuch all have &quot;Gog&quot;. These names are consequently considered textual corruptions, and &quot;Og&quot; has been suggested as the original.

The final three poems do not refer to Israel or Moab and are thus considered unusual since they seem to have little relevance to the narrative. It is thought that they may have been added to bring the number of poems up to five if inserted into the Elohist source or up to seven if only inserted once JE was constructed. While the sixth poem refers to Assyria, it is uncertain whether it is a historical reference to ancient Nineveh or a prophecy, which some religious commentators consider refers to the Seleucid Empire, which also took the name &quot;Assyria&quot;. The seventh is also ambiguous and may either be a reference to the Sea Peoples or, in the view of some religious commentators, to the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great.

In the view of some schools of textual criticism, the narrative, excepting the episode involving the donkey, is simply a framework invented to be able to insert much older poems.

==In rabbinic literature==

In rabbinic literature Balaam is represented as one of seven gentile prophets; the other six being Beor (Balaam&#x27;s father), Job, and Job&#x27;s four friends. In this literature, Balaam gradually acquired a position among the non-Jews, which was exalted as much as that of Moses among the Jews; at first being a mere interpreter of dreams, but later becoming a magician, until finally the spirit of prophecy descended upon him.

According to a negative view of Balaam in the Talmud, Balaam possessed the gift of being able to ascertain the exact moment during which God is angry—a gift bestowed upon no other creature. Balaam&#x27;s intention was to curse the Israelites at this moment of wrath, and thus cause God himself to destroy them; but God purposely restrained His anger in order to baffle the wicked prophet and to save the nation from extermination. The Talmud also recounts a more positive view of Balaam, stating that when the Torah was given to Israel, a mighty voice shook the foundations of the earth, so much so that all kings trembled, and in their consternation turned to Balaam, inquiring whether this upheaval of nature portended a second deluge; the prophet assured them that what they heard was the voice of God, giving the sacred law to the Israelites.

According to Jewish legend, Balaam was made this powerful in order to prevent the non-Jewish tribes from saying: &quot;If we had only had our own Moses, we would be as pious as the Jews.&quot; Balaam is included in the list of persons born circumcised along with Moses.

In rabbinical literature the epithet &quot;rasha&quot;, translating as &quot;the wicked one&quot;, is often attached to the name of Balaam. Balaam is pictured as blind in one eye and lame in one foot, and his disciples (followers) are distinguished by three morally corrupt qualities: an evil eye, a haughty bearing, and a greedy spirit.

Due to his behavior with the Midianites, the Rabbis interpret Balaam as responsible for the behavior during the Heresy of Peor, which they consider to have been unchastity, and consequently the death of 24,000 victims of the plague which God sent as punishment. When Balaam saw that he could not curse the children of Israel, the Rabbis assert that he advised Balak, as a last resort, to tempt the Hebrew nation to immoral acts and, through these, to the worship of Baal-peor. &quot;The God of the Hebrews&quot;, adds Balaam, &quot;hates lewdness; and severe chastisement must follow&quot;.

The Rabbis, playing on the name Balaam, call him &quot;Belo &#x27;Am&quot; (without people; that is, without a share with the people in the world to come), or &quot;Billa&#x27; &#x27;Am&quot; (one that ruined a people); and this hostility against his memory finds its climax in the dictum that whenever one discovers a feature of wickedness or disgrace in his life, one should preach about it. In the process of killing Balaam (Numbers 31:8), all four legal methods of execution—stoning, burning, decapitating, and strangling—were employed. He met his death at the age of 33, and it is stated that he had no portion in the world to come. The book devotes a special section to the history of the prophet discussing why God has taken away the power of prophecy from the Gentiles. The Talmud states that &quot;Moses wrote his book and the portion of Balaam&quot;, regarding this passage as separate from the rest of the Torah in terms of topic or style, but united in authorship.

Some have suggested that in Sanhedrin 106b and Giṭtin 57a Balaam may be likened to Jesus. Balaam&#x27;s father Beor was a son of Laban. The Book of Jasher reports that Balaam&#x27;s sons were Jannes and Jambres.

Balaam&#x27;s exclamation, &quot;How good are your tents, O Jacob, your tabernacles, O Israel!&quot;, was taken by later generations of Jews as the basis of the liturgical prayer Ma Tovu.

==In Josephus, Philo, and Christian sources==
Balaam is mentioned in several places in the New Testament, where he is cited as a type of avarice; for example in Book of Revelation 2:14 we read of false teachers at Pergamum who held the &quot;teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication&quot;. Balaam has attracted much interest, alike from Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Josephus paraphrases the story more so, and speaks of Balaam as the best prophet of his time, but with a disposition ill-adapted to resist temptation. Philo describes him as a great magician in the &quot;Life of Moses&quot;; elsewhere he speaks of &quot;the sophist Balaam, being,&quot; i.e. symbolizing &quot;a vain crowd of contrary and warring opinions&quot; and again as &quot;a vain people&quot;, both phrases being based on a mistaken etymology of the name Balaam.

A man also named Balaam also figures as an example of a false prophet motivated by greed or avarice in both 2 Peter 2:15 and in Jude 1:11. This Balaam is listed as the son of Bezer, which is usually identified as Beor. Some authors claim that Bezer was the Aramaic pronunciation of Beor, while others hold that the author was attempting to play off the Hebrew word &quot;basar&quot; or &quot;flesh&quot; to insult Balaam. Later Jewish tradition similarly played with Balaam&#x27;s name to call him corrupt and imply bestiality. Still other authors hold that Bezer and Beor are distinct, while still identifying the Balaams of the Old and New Testaments, claiming that Beor is Balaam&#x27;s father and Bezer is Balaam&#x27;s home town.

The story is also referred to in chapter 10 of 2 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

In his commentary on Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, Dale Allison associates the magi who visited the infant Jesus (Matthew 2) with Balaam, in that both Balaam and the magi were &quot;from the east&quot;: thus &quot;Matthew&#x27;s magi are Balaam&#x27;s successors&quot;.

==In the Quran==
No clear reference is made to Balaam in the Qur&#x27;an. However, the commentators argue that he is the one to whom the following text is referring:
The Muslim commentators explain that Bal&#x27;am bin Ba&#x27;ura () was a Canaanite who had been given knowledge of some of the books of God. His people asked him to curse Moses (Musa) and those who were with him, but he said, &quot;How can I curse one who has angels with him?&quot; They continued to press him, however, until he cursed the Israelites, and, as a consequence, they remained 40 years in the Wilderness of the Wanderings. Then, when he had cursed Moses, his tongue came out and fell upon his breast, and he began to pant like a dog.

The story as told by Tabari is somewhat more Biblical. Balaam had the knowledge of the Most Sacred Name of God, and whatever he asked of God was granted to him. The story of Balaam and the ass, then follows at length. When it came to the actual cursing, God &quot;turned his tongue&quot; so that the cursing fell upon his own people and the blessing upon Israel. Then his tongue came out and hung down on his breast. Finally, he advised his people to adorn and beautify their women and to send them out to ensnare the Israelites. The story of the plague at Baal-peor and of Cozbi and Zimri follows.

According to another story which al-Tabari gives, Balaam was a renegade Israelite who knew the Most Sacred Name, and to gain the things of this world, went over to the Canaanites. Al-Tha&#x27;labi adds that Balaam was descended from Lot. He gives, too, the story of Balaam&#x27;s dream, his being forbidden by God to curse Israel. Another version is that Balak, the king of Bal&#x27;a, compelled Balaam to use the Most Sacred Name against Israel. The curse fell automatically, and Moses, having learned whence it came, entreated God to take from Balaam his knowledge of the Name and his faith. This being done, they went out from him in the form of a white dove.

The Baghdadi historian Al Masudi said in his book Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems that Balaam ben Beor was in a village in the lands of Shem (Canaan), and he is the son of Baura(Beor) ben Sanur ben Waseem ben Moab ben Lot ben Haran (PUT), and his prayers were answered, so his folks asked him to pray against Joshua ben Nun but he could not do it, so he advised some of the kings of the giants to show the pretty women and release them toward the camp of Joshua ben Nun, and so they did, and they (the Israelites) hurried up to the women and the plague spread among them and seventy thousand of them were dead.

==Deir Alla inscription==
In 1967, at Deir Alla, Jordan, archaeologists found an inscription with a story relating visions of the seer of the gods Bala&#x27;am, son of Be&#x27;or, the same name appearing as that of a prophet in the Bible. In both the inscription and the Bible, Balaam is a prophet whose utterances determine the fate of nations. However, other details of the stories are different. According to the inscription, Balaam wakes up weeping and tells his people that the gods appeared to him in the night telling him about a goddess threatening to destroy the land. She is to cover the sky and reduce the world to complete darkness. In contrast with the biblical account where Balaam receives prophecies from Yahweh, the inscription associates Balaam with multiple deities (Ashtar, a god named Shgr, and Shadday gods and goddesses). If this inscription refers to Balaam mentioned in the Book of Numbers, Balaam is the earliest biblical figure identified in extra-biblical source.

&quot;The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies&quot; describes it as &quot;the oldest example of a book in a West Semitic language written with the alphabet, and the oldest piece of Aramaic literature.&quot; The inscription is datable to ca. 840–760 BCE; it was painted in red and black inks, apparently to emphasize the text, on fragments of a plastered wall: 119 pieces of inked plaster were recovered. Meindert Dijkstra suggests that &quot;the reticence of OT scholarship to take account of the text may be attributable to its damaged state, the difficulty of reconstructing and reading it, and the many questions it raises of script, language, literary form and religious content.&quot;

<doc id="58203" wikidata="Q76512" url="?curid=58203" title="Franz Xaver von Baader">
<text>Franz von Baader (27 March 1765 – 23 May 1841), born Benedikt Franz Xaver Baader, was a German Catholic philosopher, theologian, physician, and mining engineer. Resisting the empiricism of his day, he denounced most Western philosophy since Descartes as trending into atheism and has been considered a revival of the Scholastic school.

He was one of the most influential theologians of his age but his influence on subsequent philosophy has been less marked, and tends to be submerged into the esoteric discussions of later thinkers rather than cited explicitly in major publications. A notable exception to this tendency appears in the correspondence and later explication of the origins of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem&#x27;s mystical project published after Benjamin&#x27;s death where both Baader and Molitor are cited as catalytic to their exploration of the Kabbalah. An exemplar of the tendency to conceal Baader&#x27;s influence shows up at an important juncture in the thought of Martin Heidegger: Both Benjamin and Heidegger begin with similar problems derived from a revisitation of major issues in early scholastic thought in the 1913 seminar of Heinrich Rickert—a terrain towards which Baader points the way, and leaves his mark on the formulations of both Benjamin and Heidegger. Heidegger (characteristically) does not cite Baader&#x27;s work directly: rather, his terminology and manner of speaking about the problem of evil suggest that he read Baader on this subject, tracing Schelling&#x27;s formulations on theodicy to their roots in Baader on his way to the primary documents of Duns Scotus.

Today Baader is thought to have re-introduced theological engagement with Meister Eckhart into academia and even Christianity and Theosophy more generally.

== Life ==
Benedikt Franz Xaver Baader was born in Munich, Bavaria, on 27 March 1765. He was the third son of Joseph Franz von Paula Baader (15 September 1733 – 16 February 1794) and Maria Dorothea Rosalia von Schöpf (25 October 1742 – 5 February 1829), who were married on 23 May 1761. In 1775, Franz&#x27;s father Joseph became the court physician of Maximilian III Joseph, the elector of Bavaria. (The elector died two years later.)

Franz&#x27; two older brothers were both distinguished men. Clemens Alois Andreas Baader (8 April 1762 – 23 March 1838) was an author. Joseph Anton Ignaz Baader (30 September 1763 – 20 November 1835) was an engineer.

Franz studied medicine at Ingolstadt and Vienna, and for a short time assisted his father in his medical practice. However, Franz soon discovered that life as a physician did not suit him, and he decided to become a mining engineer instead. He studied under Abraham Gottlob Werner at Freiberg, travelled through several of the mining districts in north Germany, and resided in England from 1792 to 1796.

In England, Franz von Baader became acquainted with the empiricism of David Hume, David Hartley, and William Godwin, which was extremely distasteful to him. But he also came into contact with the mystical speculations of Meister Eckhart, Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, and above all those of Jakob Böhme, which were more to his liking. In 1796, he returned to Germany and, in Hamburg, became acquainted with F. H. Jacobi, with whom he became close friends. He also came into contact with Friedrich Schelling, and the works he published during this period were manifestly influenced by that philosopher, though Baader maintained his independence from Schelling.

Their friendship continued till about the year 1822, when Baader&#x27;s denunciation of modern philosophy in his letter to Tsar Alexander I entirely alienated Schelling.
During this time, Baader continued to apply himself to his profession.

He gained a prize of 12,000 gulden (≈117 kg silver) for his new method of employing sodium sulfate instead of potash in the making of glass. From 1817 to 1820, he held the post of superintendent of mines and was raised to the rank of nobility for his services. He retired in 1820, and thereafter published one of the best of his works, &quot;Fermenta Cognitionis&quot; in 6 parts from 1822 to 1825. In it, he combats modern philosophy and recommends the study of Böhme.

In 1826, when the new university was opened in Munich, he was appointed professor of philosophy and speculative theology. He published some of his lectures there in 4 parts from 1827 to 1836 under the title &quot;&quot;.

His 1831 &quot;Forty Sentences from a Religious Erotic&quot; was dedicated to Emilie Linder, a Munich painter.

In 1838, he publicly opposed the interference of the Roman Catholic Church in civil matters and, in consequence, was interdicted from lecturing on the philosophy of religion during the last three years of his life. He died on 23 May 1841. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.

==Philosophy==
Baader frequently wrote in obscure aphorisms or mystical symbols and analogies. His doctrines are mostly expounded in short detached essays, in comments on the writings of Böhme and St-Martin, or in his extensive correspondence and journals. Baader starts from the position that human reason by itself can never reach the end at which it aims and maintains that we cannot throw aside the presuppositions of faith, church, and tradition. His point of view may be compared to Scholasticism, since like the Scholastics he believed that theology and philosophy are not opposed but that reason has to make clear the truths given by authority and revelation. In his attempts to draw the realms of faith and knowledge still closer, however, he approaches the mysticism of Meister Eckhart, Paracelsus, and Böhme. Our existence depends upon God&#x27;s cognition of us. All self-consciousness is at the same time God-consciousness, and all knowledge is knowing with, consciousness of, or participation in God.

==Theology==
Baader&#x27;s philosophy is thus essentially a form of theosophy. God is not to be conceived as mere abstract Being () but as the primary Will at the basis of all things and an everlasting process or activity (&#x27;). This process functions as a self-generation of God, in which we may distinguish two aspects—the immanent or esoteric and the eminent or exoteric. Only insofar as the &quot;primitive will&quot; thinks or is conscious of itself can it distinguish knower and known, producer and produced, from which proceeds the power to become spirit. God has His reality only insofar as He is absolute spirit. The Trinity (called &#x27; in Baader) is not a given but is rendered possible, is mirrored in, and takes place through the eternal and impersonal idea or wisdom of God, which exists beside through not distinct from the &quot;primitive will&quot;. Personality and concrete reality is given to separate aspects of this Trinity through nature, which is eternally and necessarily produced by God. These aspects of existence do not occur successively within time but occur &quot;&quot; as necessary elements of the self-evolution of divine Being. Its &quot;nature&quot; is not to be confused with the nature of Creation, which is an unnecessary, free, and non-temporal act of God&#x27;s love and will which cannot be speculatively deduced but must be accepted as a historic fact.

Created beings were originally of three orders: the intelligent or angels; the non-intelligent material world; and man, who mediated between them. Angels and man were endowed with freedom. The Fall of Adam and Lucifer were historic facts which were possible, though not necessary. Baader considered the angels to have fallen through a desire to ascend to equality with God (i.e., pride) and man through permitting himself to sink to the level of nature (via the various bodily sins). Baader considered that the world as we know it—with time, space, and matter—only began after the fall of mankind and was created as a gift from God permitting humanity the opportunity for redemption. Baader developed theories of physiology and anthropology over a number of works based upon this understanding of the universe, but in the main coincides with the ideas of Böhme. Principally, he traces the adverse effects of various sins and advocates the restoration of natural harmonies by its removal.

His system of ethics rejects the idea that obedience to moral laws alone (as in Kantianism) is enough. Instead, though humanity has lost the ability to accomplish this on its own, it is necessary to realize and participate in our place in the divine order. As grace is required for such a realization, no ethical theory neglecting sin and redemption is satisfactory or even possible. Mere works are never sufficient, but Christ&#x27;s healing virtue must be received, chiefly through prayer and the sacraments of the church.

Baader was regarded as among the greatest speculative theologians of 19th-century Catholicism and influenced, among others, Richard Rothe, Julius Müller, and Hans Lassen Martensen.

==Politics==
Baader argued that two things were requisite in the state: common submission to the ruler (without which there would be civil war or invasion) and inequality of rank (without which there would be no organization). As Baader considered God alone to be the true ruler of mankind, he argued that loyalty to a government can only be secured or given when it was truly Christian; he opposed despotism, socialism, liberalism equally. His idea state was a civil community ruled by the Catholic Church, whose principles opposed both passive and irrational pietism and the excessively rational doctrines of Protestantism.

==Gender issues==
One of Baader&#x27;s central ideas is his concept of androgyny:

Following the literal wording of the first of Genesis&#x27;s two accounts of the creation of man, Baader says that Man was originally an androgynous being. Neither man nor woman is the &quot;image and likeness of God&quot; but only the androgyne. Both sexes are equally fallen from the original divinity of the androgyne. Androgynism is man&#x27;s likeness to God, his supernatural upsurge. Hence it follows that sexes must cease and vanish. From these positions Baader interpreted the sacrament of marriage as a symbolic restitution of angelic bisexuality: 

Ultimately Christ&#x27;s sacrifice will make possible a restoration of the primal androgyny. Baader believed that primordial androgyny would return as the world neared its end.

==Works==
Several years after his death, Baader&#x27;s works were collected and edited by a number of his disciples. This was published in 16 volumes at Leipzig between 1851 and 1860, organized by topic. Vol. I dealt with epistemology, Vol. II with metaphysics, Vol. III with natural philosophy, Vol. IV with anthropology, Vols. V &amp; VI with social philosophy, Vols. VII through X with philosophy of religion, Vol. XI with Baader&#x27;s diaries, Vol. XII with his commentaries on St-Martin, Vol. XIII with his commentaries on Böhme, Vol. XIV with time, and Vol. XV with his biography and correspondence. Vol. XVI contained an index to the others, as well as an able sketch of his system by Lutterbeck. Valuable introductions by the editors are prefixed to the several volumes.

<text>Baal (), or Baʻal, was a title and honorific meaning &#x27;owner&#x27; or &#x27;lord&#x27; in the Northwest Semitic languages spoken in the Levant during antiquity. From its use among people, it came to be applied to gods. Scholars previously associated the theonym with solar cults and with a variety of unrelated patron deities, but inscriptions have shown that the name Ba&#x27;al was particularly associated with the storm and fertility god Hadad and his local manifestations.

The Hebrew Bible includes use of the term in reference to various Levantine deities, often with application towards Hadad, who was decried as a false god. That use was taken over into Christianity and Islam, sometimes under the form Beelzebub in demonology.

The Ugaritic god Baal (𐎁𐎓𐎍) is the protagonist of one of the lengthiest surviving epics from the ancient Near East, the Baal Cycle.

==Name==

===Epithets===
Ba&#x27;al&#x27;s widely used epithet is &quot;rider (or mounter) of the clouds.&quot; (&quot;rkb ʿrpt&quot;, cf. &quot;rkb bʿrbt&quot; in Ps. 68:5; Ugaritic &quot;rkb ʿrpt&quot;.) These are related to Zeus&#x27;s &quot;gatherer of the clouds&quot; and Yahweh&#x27;s &quot;rider of the heavens.&quot; Like English ride, &quot;rkb&quot; has equine and sexual uses.
===Etymology===
The spelling of the English term &quot;Baal&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;Báal&quot; () which appears in the New Testament and Septuagint, and from its Latinized form &quot;&quot;, which appears in the Vulgate. These forms in turn derive from the vowel-less Northwest Semitic form (Phoenician and ). The word&#x27;s biblical senses as a Phoenician deity and false gods generally were extended during the Protestant Reformation to denote any idols, icons of the saints, or the Catholic Church generally. In such contexts, it follows the anglicized pronunciation and usually omits any mark between its two As. In close transliteration of the Semitic name, the ayin is represented, as &quot;Baʿal&quot;.

In the Northwest Semitic languages—Ugaritic, Phoenician, Hebrew, Amorite, and Aramaic—the word &quot;baʿal&quot; signified &#x27;owner&#x27; and, by extension, &#x27;lord&#x27;, a &#x27;master&#x27;, or &#x27;husband&#x27;. 
Cognates include the Akkadian &quot;Bēlu&quot; (), Amharic &quot;bal&quot; (), and Arabic &quot;baʿl&quot; (). &quot;Báʿal&quot; () and &quot;baʿl&quot; still serve as the words for &#x27;husband&#x27; in modern Hebrew and Arabic respectively. They also appear in some contexts concerning the ownership of things or possession of traits.

The feminine form is &quot;baʿalah&quot; (; ), meaning &#x27;mistress&#x27; in the sense of a female owner or lady of the house and still serving as a rare word for &#x27;wife&#x27;.

Suggestions in early modern scholarship also included comparison with the Celtic god Belenus, however this is now widely rejected by contemporary scholars.

==Semitic religion==
===Generic===

Like En in Sumerian, the Akkadian &quot;bēlu&quot; and Northwest Semitic &quot;baʿal&quot; (as well as its feminine form &quot;baʿalah&quot;) was used as a title of various deities in the Mesopotamian and Semitic pantheons. Only a definitive article, genitive or epithet, or context could establish which particular god was meant.

===Hadad===
Baʿal was also used as a proper name by the third millennium BC, when he appears in a list of deities at Abu Salabikh. Most modern scholarship asserts that this Baʿal—usually distinguished as &quot;The Lord&quot; (, &quot;Ha-Baʿal&quot;)—was identical with the storm and fertility god Hadad; it also appears in the form &quot;Baʿal Haddu&quot;. Scholars propose that, as the cult of Hadad increased in importance, his true name came to be seen as too holy for any but the high priest to speak aloud and the alias &quot;Lord&quot; (&quot;Baʿal&quot;) was used instead, as &quot;Bel&quot; was used for Marduk among the Babylonians and &quot;Adonai&quot; for Yahweh among the Israelites. A minority propose that Baʿal was a native Canaanite deity whose cult was identified with or absorbed aspects of Adad&#x27;s. Regardless of their original relationship, by the 1st millennium BCE, the two were distinct: Hadad was worshiped by the Aramaeans and Baʿal by the Phoenicians and other Canaanites.

===Baʿal===

Baʿal is well-attested in surviving inscriptions and was popular in theophoric names throughout the Levant but he is usually mentioned along with other gods, &quot;his own field of action being seldom defined&quot;. Nonetheless, Ugaritic records show him as a weather god, with particular power over lightning, wind, rain, and fertility. The dry summers of the area were explained as Baʿal&#x27;s time in the underworld, and his return in autumn was said to have caused the storms that revived the land. Thus, the worship of Baʿal in Canaan—where he eventually supplanted El as the leader of the gods and patron of kingship—was connected to the region&#x27;s dependence on rainfall for its agriculture, unlike Egypt and Mesopotamia, which focused on irrigation from their major rivers. Anxiety about water availability for crops and trees increased the importance of his cult, which focused attention on his role as a rain god. He was also called upon during battle, showing that he was thought to intervene actively in the world of man, unlike the more aloof El. The Lebanese city of Baalbeck was named after Baal. Alternatively, Ba&#x27; al is a divine co-regent with El, where El was the executive while Ba&#x27; al was the sustainer of the cosmos.

The Baʿal of Ugarit was the epithet of Hadad, but as time passed, the epithet became the god&#x27;s name while Hadad became the epithet. Baʿal was usually said to be the son of Dagan, but appears as one of the sons of El in Ugaritic sources. Both Baʿal and El were associated with the bull in Ugaritic texts, as they symbolized both strength and fertility. He held special enmity against snakes, both on their own and as representatives of Yammu ( &quot;Sea&quot;), the Canaanite sea god and river god. He fought the Tannin (&quot;Tunnanu&quot;), the &quot;Twisted Serpent&quot; (&quot;Bṯn ʿqltn&quot;), &quot;Lotan the Fugitive Serpent&quot; (&quot;Ltn Bṯn Brḥ&quot;, the biblical Leviathan), and the &quot;Mighty One with Seven Heads&quot; (&quot;Šlyṭ D.šbʿt Rašm&quot;). Baʿal&#x27;s conflict with Yammu is now generally regarded as the prototype of the vision recorded in the 7th chapter of the biblical Book of Daniel. As vanquisher of the sea, the Canaanites and Phoenicians regarded Baʿal as the patron of sailors and sea-going merchants. As vanquisher of Mot, the Canaanite death god, he was known as Baʿal Rāpiʾuma (&quot;Bʿl Rpu&quot;) and regarded as the leader of the Rephaim (&quot;Rpum&quot;), the ancestral spirits, particularly those of ruling dynasties.

From Canaan, worship of Baʿal spread to Egypt by the Middle Kingdom and throughout the Mediterranean following the waves of Phoenician colonization in the early 1st millennium BCE. He was described with diverse epithets, and before Ugarit was rediscovered, these were supposed to refer to distinct local gods. However, as explained by Day, the texts at Ugarit revealed that they were considered &quot;local manifestations of this particular deity, analogous to the local manifestations of the Virgin Mary in the Roman Catholic Church&quot;. In those inscriptions, he is frequently described as &quot;Victorious Baʿal&quot; (&quot;Aliyn&quot; or &quot;Ảlỉyn Baʿal&quot;), &quot;Mightiest one&quot; (&quot;Aliy&quot; or &quot;ʾAly&quot;) or &quot;Mightiest of the Heroes&quot; (&quot;Aliy Qrdm&quot;), &quot;The Powerful One&quot; (&quot;Dmrn&quot;), and in his role as patron of the city &quot;Baʿal of Ugarit&quot; (&quot;Baʿal Ugarit&quot;). As Baʿal Zaphon (&quot;Baʿal Ṣapunu&quot;), he was particularly associated with his palace atop Jebel Aqra (the ancient Mount Ṣapānu and classical Mons Casius). He is also mentioned as &quot;Winged Baʿal&quot; (&quot;Bʿl Knp&quot;) and &quot;Baʿal of the Arrows&quot; (&quot;Bʿl Ḥẓ&quot;). Phoenician and Aramaic inscriptions describe &quot;Baʿal of the Mace&quot; (&quot;Bʿl Krntryš&quot;), &quot;Baʿal of the Lebanon&quot; (&quot;Bʿl Lbnn&quot;), &quot;Baʿal of Sidon&quot; (&quot;Bʿl Ṣdn&quot;), &quot;Bʿl Ṣmd&quot;, &quot;Baʿal of the Heavens&quot; (&quot;Baʿal Shamem&quot; or &quot;Shamayin&quot;), Baʿal ʾAddir (&quot;Bʿl ʾdr&quot;), Baʿal Hammon (&quot;Baʿal Ḥamon&quot;), &quot;Bʿl Mgnm&quot;.

===Baʿal Hammon===

Baʿal Hammon was worshipped in the Tyrian colony of Carthage as their supreme god. It is believed that this position developed in the 5th century BCE following the severing of its ties to Tyre following the 480 BCE Battle of Himera. Like Hadad, Baʿal Hammon was a fertility god. Inscriptions about Punic deities tend to be rather uninformative, though, and he has been variously identified as a moon god and as Dagan, the grain god. Rather than the bull, Baʿal Hammon was associated with the ram and depicted with his horns. The archaeological record seems to bear out accusations in Roman sources that the Carthaginians burned their children as human sacrifices to him. He was worshipped as Baʿal Karnaim (&quot;Lord of the Two Horns&quot;), particularly at an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein (&quot;Two-Horn Hill&quot;) across the bay from Carthage. His consort was the goddess Tanit.

The epithet Hammon is obscure. Most often, it is connected with the NW Semitic &quot;ḥammān&quot; (&quot;brazier&quot;) and associated with a role as a sun god. Renan and Gibson linked it to Hammon (modern Umm el-‘Amed between Tyre in Lebanon and Acre in Israel) and Cross and Lipiński to Haman or Khamōn, the classical Mount Amanus and modern Nur Mountains, which separate northern Syria from southeastern Cilicia.

==Judaism==

Baʿal (בַּעַל) appears about 90 times in the Hebrew Bible in reference to various gods. The priests of the Canaanite Baʿal are mentioned numerous times, most prominently in the First Book of Kings. Many scholars believe that this describes Jezebel&#x27;s attempt to introduce the worship of the Baʿal of Tyre, Melqart, to the Israelite capital Samaria in the 9th century BCE. Against this, Day argues that Jezebel&#x27;s Baʿal was more probably Baʿal Shamem, the Lord of the Heavens, a title most often applied to Hadad, who is also often titled just Ba‘al.

1 Kings 18 records an account of a contest between the prophet Elijah and Jezebel&#x27;s priests. Both sides offered a sacrifice to their respective gods: Ba&#x27;al failed to light his followers&#x27; sacrifice while Yahweh&#x27;s heavenly fire burnt Elijah&#x27;s altar to ashes, even after it had been soaked with water. The observers then followed Elijah&#x27;s instructions to slay the priests of Baʿal, after which it began to rain, showing Yahweh&#x27;s mastery over the weather.

Other references to the priests of Baʿal describe their burning of incense in prayer and their offering of sacrifice while adorned in special vestments.

===Yahweh===

The title &quot;baʿal&quot; was a synonym in some contexts of the Hebrew &quot;adon&quot; (&quot;Lord&quot;) and &quot;adonai&quot; (&quot;My Lord&quot;) still used as aliases of the Lord of Israel Yahweh. According to some scholars, the early Hebrews did use the names Baʿal (&quot;Lord&quot;) and Baʿali (&quot;My Lord&quot;) in reference to the Lord of Israel, just as Baʿal farther north designated the Lord of Ugarit or Lebanon. This occurred both directly and as the divine element of some Hebrew theophoric names. However, according to others it is not certain that the name Baal was definitely applied to Yahweh in early Israelite history. The component Baal in proper names is mostly applied to worshippers of Baal, or descendants of the worshippers of Baal. Names including the element Baʿal presumably in reference to Yahweh include the judge Gideon (also known as Jerubaʿal,  &quot;The Lord Strives&quot;), Saul&#x27;s son Eshbaʿal (&quot;The Lord is Great&quot;), and David&#x27;s son Beeliada (&quot;The Lord Knows&quot;). The name Bealiah (&quot;The Lord is Jah&quot;; &quot;Yahweh is Baʿal&quot;) combined the two. However John Day states that as far as the names Eshba’al, Meriba’al, and Beeliada (that is Baaliada), are concerned it is not certain whether they simply allude to the Canaanite god Ba’al, or are intended to equate Yahweh with Ba’al, or have no connection to Ba’al.

It was the program of Jezebel, in the 9th century BCE, to introduce into Israel&#x27;s capital city of Samaria her Phoenician worship of Baal as opposed to the worship of Yahweh that made the name anathema to the Israelites.
 Eshbaʿal became Ish-bosheth and Meribaʿal became Mephibosheth, but other possibilities also occurred. Gideon&#x27;s name Jerubaʿal was mentioned intact but glossed as a mockery of the Canaanite god, implying that he strove in vain. Direct use of Baʿali continued at least as late as the time of the prophet Hosea, who reproached the Israelites for doing so.

Brad E. Kelle has suggested that references to cultic sexual practices in the worship of Baal, in Hosea 2, are evidence of an historical situation in which Israelites were either giving up Yahweh worship for Baal, or blending the two. Hosea&#x27;s references to sexual acts being metaphors for Israelite &quot;apostasy&quot;.

Brian P. Irwin argues that &quot;Baal&quot; in northern Israelite traditions is a form of Yahweh that was rejected as foreign by the prophets. In southern Israelite traditions, &quot;Baal&quot; was a god that was worshipped in Jerusalem. His worshippers saw him as compatible or identical with Yahweh and honored him with human sacrifices and fragrant meal offerings. Eventually, the Chronicler(s) disapproved of both &quot;Baals&quot; whilst the Deuteronomists used &quot;Baals&quot; for any god they disapproved of.

Likewise, Mark S. Smith believes Yahweh was more likely to be inspired by Baal rather than El, since both are stormy divine warriors and lack the pacifistic traits of El according to the Ugaritic texts and Hebrew Bible.

===Baʿal Berith===

Baʿal Berith (&quot;Lord of the Covenant&quot;) was a god worshipped by the Israelites when they &quot;went astray&quot; after the death of Gideon according to the Hebrew Scriptures. The same source relates that Gideon&#x27;s son Abimelech went to his mother&#x27;s kin at Shechem and received 70 shekels of silver &quot;from the House of Baʿal Berith&quot; to assist in killing his 70 brothers from Gideon&#x27;s other wives. An earlier passage had made Shechem the scene of Joshua&#x27;s covenant between all the tribes of Israel and &quot;El Yahweh, our god of Israel&quot; and a later one describes it as the location of the &quot;House of El Berith&quot;. It is thus unclear whether the false worship of the &quot;Baʿalim&quot; being decried is the worship of a new idol or rites and teachings placing Yahweh as a mere local god within a larger pantheon. The Hebrew Scriptures record the worship of Baʿal threatening Israel from the time of the Judges until the monarchy. However, during the period of Judges such worship seems to have been an occasional deviation from a deeper and more constant worship of Yahweh:
The Deuteronomist and the present form of Jeremiah seem to phrase the struggle as monolatry or monotheism against polytheism. Yahweh is frequently identified in the Hebrew scriptures with El Elyon, however, this was after a conflation with El in a process of religious syncretism. &quot;’El&quot; () became a generic term meaning &quot;god&quot;, as opposed to the name of a worshipped deity, and epithets such as El Shaddai came to be applied to Yahweh alone, while Baal&#x27;s nature as a storm and weather god became assimilated into Yahweh&#x27;s own identification with the storm. In the next stage the Yahwistic religion separated itself from its Canaanite heritage, first by rejecting Baal-worship in the 9th century, then through the 8th to 6th centuries with prophetic condemnation of Baal, sun-worship, worship on the &quot;high places&quot;, practices pertaining to the dead, and other matters.


===Beelzebub===

Baʿal Zebub (,  &quot;Fly Lord&quot;) occurs in the first chapter of the Second Book of Kings as the name of the Philistine god of Ekron. In it, Ahaziah, king of Israel, is said to have consulted the priests of Baʿal Zebub as to whether he would survive the injuries from his recent fall. The prophet Elijah, incensed at this impiety, then foretold that he would die quickly, raining heavenly fire on the soldiers sent to punish him for doing so. Jewish scholars have interpreted the title of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as the Hebrew way of calling Baʿal a pile of dung and his followers vermin, although others argue for a link to power over causing and curing pestilence and thus suitable for Ahaziah&#x27;s question. The Septuagint renders the name as &quot;Baälzeboúb&quot; () and as &quot;Baʿal of Flies&quot; (, &quot;Baäl muian&quot;). Symmachus the Ebionite rendered it as &quot;Beëlzeboúl&quot; (), possibly reflecting its original sense. This has been proposed to have been &quot;B‘l Zbl&quot;, Ugaritic for &quot;Prince Baal&quot;.

==Classical sources==
Outside of Jewish and Christian contexts, the various forms of Baʿal were indifferently rendered in classical sources as Belus (, &quot;Bē̂los&quot;). An example is Josephus, who states that Jezebel &quot;built a temple to the god of the Tyrians, which they call Belus&quot;; this describes the Baʿal of Tyre, Melqart. Herrmann identifies the Demarus/Demarous figure mentioned by Philo Byblius as Baʿal.

Baʿal Hammon, however, was identified with the Greek Cronos and the Roman Saturn as the Zabul Saturn. He was probably never equated with Melqart, although this assertion appears in older scholarship.

==Christianity==
Beelzebub or Beelzebul was identified by the writers of the New Testament as Satan, &quot;prince&quot; (i.e., king) of the demons.

John Milton&#x27;s 1667 epic &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; describes the fallen angels collecting around Satan, stating that, though their heavenly names had been &quot;blotted out and ras&#x27;d&quot;, they would acquire new ones &quot;wandring o&#x27;re the Earth&quot; as false gods. &quot;Baalim&quot; and &quot;Ashtaroth&quot; are given as the collective names of the male and female demons (respectively) who came from between the &quot;bordering flood of old Euphrates&quot; and &quot;the Brook that parts Egypt from Syrian ground&quot;.

&quot;Baal&quot; and derived epithets like &quot;Baalist&quot; were used as slurs during the English Reformation for the saints and their devotees.

==Islam==
The Quran mentions that Prophet Elias (Elijah) warned his people against Baʿal worship.
According to Tabari, &quot;baal&quot; is a term used by Arabs to denote everything which is a &quot;lord&quot; over anything.

Al-Thaʿlabī offers a more detailed description about Baal; accordingly it was an idol of gold, twenty cubits tall, and had four faces.

The trilateral root, (&quot;bā, ayn, lam)&quot; &quot;baʿl&quot; occurs seven times in the Qur’an with its common Semitic usage of “owner, husband,” particularly husband. For example, Sarah, wife of Abraham refers to her husband using the term.

<text>In computing, a vector processor or array processor is a central processing unit (CPU) that implements an instruction set where its instructions are designed to operate efficiently and effectively on large one-dimensional arrays of data called &quot;vectors&quot;. This is in contrast to scalar processors, whose instructions operate on single data items only, and in contrast to some of those same scalar processors having additional single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) or SIMD within a register (SWAR) Arithmetic Units. Vector processors can greatly improve performance on certain workloads, notably numerical simulation and similar tasks. Vector processing techniques also operate in video-game console hardware and in graphics accelerators.

Vector machines appeared in the early 1970s and dominated supercomputer design through the 1970s into the 1990s, notably the various Cray platforms. The rapid fall in the price-to-performance ratio of conventional microprocessor designs led to a decline in vector supercomputers during the 1990s.

== History ==

=== Early research and development ===

Vector processing development began in the early 1960s at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in their &quot;Solomon&quot; project. Solomon&#x27;s goal was to dramatically increase math performance by using a large number of simple coprocessors under the control of a single master Central processing unit (CPU). The CPU fed a single common instruction to all of the arithmetic logic units (ALUs), one per cycle, but with a different data point for each one to work on. This allowed the Solomon machine to apply a single algorithm to a large data set, fed in the form of an array.

In 1962, Westinghouse cancelled the project, but the effort was restarted by the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign as the ILLIAC IV. Their version of the design originally called for a 1 GFLOPS machine with 256 ALUs, but, when it was finally delivered in 1972, it had only 64 ALUs and could reach only 100 to 150 MFLOPS. Nevertheless, it showed that the basic concept was sound, and, when used on data-intensive applications, such as computational fluid dynamics, the ILLIAC was the fastest machine in the world. The ILLIAC approach of using separate ALUs for each data element is not common to later designs, and is often referred to under a separate category, massively parallel computing. Around this time Flynn categorized this type of processing as an early form of single instruction, multiple threads (SIMT).

International Computers Limited sought to avoid many of the difficulties with the ILLIAC concept with its own Distributed Array Processor (DAP) design, categorising the ILLIAC and DAP as cellular array processors that potentially offered substantial performance benefits over conventional vector processor designs such as the CDC STAR-100 and Cray 1.

===Computer for operations with functions===
A computer for operations with functions was presented and developed by Kartsev in 1967.

=== Supercomputers ===
The first vector supercomputers are the Control Data Corporation STAR-100 and Texas Instruments Advanced Scientific Computer (ASC), which were introduced in 1974 and 1972, respectively.

The basic ASC (i.e., &quot;one pipe&quot;) ALU used a pipeline architecture that supported both scalar and vector computations, with peak performance reaching approximately 20 MFLOPS, readily achieved when processing long vectors. Expanded ALU configurations supported &quot;two pipes&quot; or &quot;four pipes&quot; with a corresponding 2X or 4X performance gain. Memory bandwidth was sufficient to support these expanded modes.

The STAR-100 was otherwise slower than CDC&#x27;s own supercomputers like the CDC 7600, but at data-related tasks they could keep up while being much smaller and less expensive. However the machine also took considerable time decoding the vector instructions and getting ready to run the process, so it required very specific data sets to work on before it actually sped anything up.

The vector technique was first fully exploited in 1976 by the famous Cray-1. Instead of leaving the data in memory like the STAR-100 and ASC, the Cray design had eight vector registers, which held sixty-four 64-bit words each. The vector instructions were applied between registers, which is much faster than talking to main memory. Whereas the STAR-100 would apply a single operation across a long vector in memory and then move on to the next operation, the Cray design would load a smaller section of the vector into registers and then apply as many operations as it could to that data, thereby avoiding many of the much slower memory access operations.

The Cray design used pipeline parallelism to implement vector instructions rather than multiple ALUs. In addition, the design had completely separate pipelines for different instructions, for example, addition/subtraction was implemented in different hardware than multiplication. This allowed a batch of vector instructions to be pipelined into each of the ALU subunits, a technique they called &quot;vector chaining&quot;. The Cray-1 normally had a performance of about 80 MFLOPS, but with up to three chains running it could peak at 240 MFLOPS and averaged around 150 – far faster than any machine of the era.

Other examples followed. Control Data Corporation tried to re-enter the high-end market again with its ETA-10 machine, but it sold poorly and they took that as an opportunity to leave the supercomputing field entirely. In the early and mid-1980s Japanese companies (Fujitsu, Hitachi and Nippon Electric Corporation (NEC) introduced register-based vector machines similar to the Cray-1, typically being slightly faster and much smaller. Oregon-based Floating Point Systems (FPS) built add-on array processors for minicomputers, later building their own minisupercomputers.

Throughout, Cray continued to be the performance leader, continually beating the competition with a series of machines that led to the Cray-2, Cray X-MP and Cray Y-MP. Since then, the supercomputer market has focused much more on massively parallel processing rather than better implementations of vector processors. However, recognising the benefits of vector processing, IBM developed Virtual Vector Architecture for use in supercomputers coupling several scalar processors to act as a vector processor.

Although vector supercomputers resembling the Cray-1 are less popular these days, NEC has continued to make this type of computer up to the present day with their SX series of computers. Most recently, the SX-Aurora TSUBASA places the processor and either 24 or 48 gigabytes of memory on an HBM 2 module within a card that physically resembles a graphics coprocessor, but instead of serving as a co-processor, it is the main computer with the PC-compatible computer into which it is plugged serving support functions.

=== GPU ===
Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) include an array of shader pipelines which may be driven by compute kernels, and can be considered vector processors (using a similar strategy for hiding memory latencies). As shown in Flynn&#x27;s 1972 paper the key distinguishing factor of SIMT-based GPUs is that it has a single instruction decoder-broadcaster but that the cores receiving and executing that same instruction are otherwise reasonably normal: their own ALUs, their own register files, their own Load/Store units and their own independent L1 data caches. Thus although all cores simultaneously execute the exact same instruction in lock-step with each other they do so with completely different data from completely different memory locations. This is &quot;significantly&quot; more complex and involved than &quot;Packed SIMD&quot;, which is strictly limited to execution of parallel pipelined arithmetic operations only. Although the exact internal details of today&#x27;s commercial GPUs are proprietary secrets, the MIAOW team was able to piece together anecdotal information sufficient to implement a subset of the AMDGPU architecture.

=== Recent development ===

Several modern CPU architectures are being designed as vector processors. The RISC-V vector extension follows similar principles as the early vector processors, and is being implemented in commercial products such as the Andes Technology AX45MPV. There are also several open source vector processor architectures being developed, including ForwardCom and Libre-SOC.

== Comparison with modern architectures ==

 most commodity CPUs implement architectures that feature fixed-length SIMD instructions. On first inspection these can be considered a form of vector processing because they operate on multiple (vectorized, explicit length) data sets, and borrow features from vector processors. However, by definition, the addition of SIMD cannot, by itself, qualify a processor as an actual &quot;vector processor&quot;, because SIMD is , and vectors are . The difference is illustrated below with examples, showing and comparing the three categories: Pure SIMD, Predicated SIMD, and Pure Vector Processing.

* Pure (fixed) SIMD - also known as &quot;Packed SIMD&quot;, SIMD within a register (SWAR), and Pipelined Processor in Flynn&#x27;s Taxonomy. Common examples using SIMD with features inspired by vector processors include: Intel x86&#x27;s MMX, SSE and AVX instructions, AMD&#x27;s 3DNow! extensions, ARM NEON, Sparc&#x27;s VIS extension, PowerPC&#x27;s AltiVec and MIPS&#x27; MSA. In 2000, IBM, Toshiba and Sony collaborated to create the Cell processor, which is also SIMD.
* Predicated SIMD - also known as associative processing. Two notable examples which have per-element (lane-based) predication are ARM SVE2 and AVX-512
* Pure Vectors - as categorised in Duncan&#x27;s taxonomy - these include the original Cray-1, Convex C-Series, NEC SX, and RISC-V RVV. Although memory-based, the CDC STAR-100 was also a vector processor.

Other CPU designs include some multiple instructions for vector processing on multiple (vectorized) data sets, typically known as MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) and realized with VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) and EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing). The Fujitsu FR-V VLIW/vector processor combines both technologies.

=== Difference between SIMD and vector processors ===

SIMD instruction sets lack crucial features when compared to vector instruction sets. The most important of these is that vector processors, inherently by definition and design, have always been variable-length since their inception.

Whereas pure (fixed-width, no predication) SIMD is often mistakenly claimed to be &quot;vector&quot; (because SIMD processes data which happens to be vectors), through close analysis and comparison of historic and modern ISAs, actual vector ISAs may be observed to have the following features that no SIMD ISA has:
* a way to set the vector length, such as the instruction in RISCV RVV, or the instruction in NEC SX, without restricting the length to a power of two or to a multiple of a fixed data width.
* Iteration and reduction over elements vectors.

Predicated SIMD (part of Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy) which is comprehensive individual element-level predicate masks on every vector instruction as is now available in ARM SVE2. And AVX-512, almost qualifies as a vector processor. Predicated SIMD uses fixed-width SIMD ALUs but allows locally controlled (predicated) activation of units to provide the appearance of variable length vectors. Examples below help explain these categorical distinctions.

SIMD, because it uses fixed-width batch processing, is to cope with iteration and reduction. This is illustrated further with examples, below.

Additionally, vector processors can be more resource-efficient by using slower hardware and saving power, but still achieving throughput and having less latency than SIMD, through vector chaining.

Consider both a SIMD processor and a vector processor working on 4 64-bit elements, doing a LOAD, ADD, MULTIPLY and STORE sequence. If the SIMD width is 4, then the SIMD processor must LOAD four elements entirely before it can move on to the ADDs, must complete all the ADDs before it can move on to the MULTIPLYs, and likewise must complete all of the MULTIPLYs before it can start the STOREs. This is by definition and by design.

Having to perform 4-wide simultaneous 64-bit LOADs and 64-bit STOREs is very costly in hardware (256 bit data paths to memory). Having 4x 64-bit ALUs, especially MULTIPLY, likewise. To avoid these high costs, a SIMD processor would have to have 1-wide 64-bit LOAD, 1-wide 64-bit STORE, and only 2-wide 64-bit ALUs. As shown in the diagram, which assumes a multi-issue execution model, the consequences are that the operations now take longer to complete. If multi-issue is not possible, then the operations take even longer because the LD may not be issued (started) at the same time as the first ADDs, and so on. If there are only 4-wide 64-bit SIMD ALUs, the completion time is even worse: only when all four LOADs have completed may the SIMD operations start, and only when all ALU operations have completed may the STOREs begin.

A vector processor, by contrast, even if it is &quot;single-issue&quot; and uses no SIMD ALUs, only having 1-wide 64-bit LOAD, 1-wide 64-bit STORE (and, as in the Cray-1, the ability to run MULTIPLY simultaneously with ADD), may complete the four operations faster than a SIMD processor with 1-wide LOAD, 1-wide STORE, and 2-wide SIMD. This more efficient resource utilization, due to vector chaining, is a key advantage and difference compared to SIMD. SIMD, by design and definition, cannot perform chaining except to the entire group of results.

== Description ==

In general terms, CPUs are able to manipulate one or two pieces of data at a time. For instance, most CPUs have an instruction that essentially says &quot;add A to B and put the result in C&quot;. The data for A, B and C could be—in theory at least—encoded directly into the instruction. However, in efficient implementation things are rarely that simple. The data is rarely sent in raw form, and is instead &quot;pointed to&quot; by passing in an address to a memory location that holds the data. Decoding this address and getting the data out of the memory takes some time, during which the CPU traditionally would sit idle waiting for the requested data to show up. As CPU speeds have increased, this memory latency has historically become a large impediment to performance; see .

In order to reduce the amount of time consumed by these steps, most modern CPUs use a technique known as instruction pipelining in which the instructions pass through several sub-units in turn. The first sub-unit reads the address and decodes it, the next &quot;fetches&quot; the values at those addresses, and the next does the math itself. With pipelining the &quot;trick&quot; is to start decoding the next instruction even before the first has left the CPU, in the fashion of an assembly line, so the address decoder is constantly in use. Any particular instruction takes the same amount of time to complete, a time known as the &quot;latency&quot;, but the CPU can process an entire batch of operations, in an overlapping fashion, much faster and more efficiently than if it did so one at a time.

Vector processors take this concept one step further. Instead of pipelining just the instructions, they also pipeline the data itself. The processor is fed instructions that say not just to add A to B, but to add all of the numbers &quot;from here to here&quot; to all of the numbers &quot;from there to there&quot;. Instead of constantly having to decode instructions and then fetch the data needed to complete them, the processor reads a single instruction from memory, and it is simply implied in the definition of the instruction &quot;itself&quot; that the instruction will operate again on another item of data, at an address one increment larger than the last. This allows for significant savings in decoding time.

To illustrate what a difference this can make, consider the simple task of adding two groups of 10 numbers together. In a normal programming language one would write a &quot;loop&quot; that picked up each of the pairs of numbers in turn, and then added them. To the CPU, this would look something like this:
; Hypothetical RISC machine
; assume a, b, and c are memory locations in their respective registers
; add 10 numbers in a to 10 numbers in b, store results in c
 move $10, count ; count := 10
loop:
 load r1, a
 load r2, b
 add r3, r1, r2 ; r3 := r1 + r2
 store r3, c
 add a, a, $4 ; move on
 add b, b, $4
 add c, c, $4
 dec count ; decrement
 jnez count, loop ; loop back if count is not yet 0
 ret
But to a vector processor, this task looks considerably different:

; assume we have vector registers v1-v3
; with size equal or larger than 10
 move $10, count ; count = 10
 vload v1, a, count
 vload v2, b, count
 vadd v3, v1, v2
 vstore v3, c, count
 ret
Note the complete lack of looping in the instructions, because it is the &quot;hardware&quot; which has performed 10 sequential operations: effectively the loop count is on an explicit &quot;per-instruction&quot; basis.

Cray-style vector ISAs take this a step further and provide a global &quot;count&quot; register, called vector length (VL):
; again assume we have vector registers v1-v3
; with size larger than or equal to 10
 setvli $10 # Set vector length VL=10
 vload v1, a # 10 loads from a
 vload v2, b # 10 loads from b
 vadd v3, v1, v2 # 10 adds
 vstore v3, c # 10 stores into c
 ret
There are several savings inherent in this approach.

# only three address translations are needed. Depending on the architecture, this can represent a significant savings by itself.
# Another saving is fetching and decoding the instruction itself, which has to be done only one time instead of ten.
# The code itself is also smaller, which can lead to more efficient memory use, reduction in L1 instruction cache size, reduction in power consumption.
# With the program size being reduced branch prediction has an easier job.
# With the length (equivalent to SIMD width) not being hard-coded into the instruction, not only is the encoding more compact, it&#x27;s also &quot;future-proof&quot; and allows even embedded processor designs to consider using vectors purely to gain all the other advantages, rather than go for high performance.

Additionally, in more modern vector processor ISAs, &quot;Fail on First&quot; or &quot;Fault First&quot; has been introduced (see below) which brings even more advantages.

But more than that, a high performance vector processor may have multiple functional units adding those numbers in parallel. The checking of dependencies between those numbers is not required as a vector instruction specifies multiple independent operations. This simplifies the control logic required, and can further improve performance by avoiding stalls. The math operations thus completed far faster overall, the limiting factor being the time required to fetch the data from memory.

Not all problems can be attacked with this sort of solution. Including these types of instructions necessarily adds complexity to the core CPU. That complexity typically makes &quot;other&quot; instructions run slower—i.e., whenever it is not adding up many numbers in a row. The more complex instructions also add to the complexity of the decoders, which might slow down the decoding of the more common instructions such as normal adding. (&quot;This can be somewhat mitigated by keeping the entire ISA to RISC principles: RVV only adds around 190 vector instructions even with the advanced features.&quot;)

Vector processors were traditionally designed to work best only when there are large amounts of data to be worked on. For this reason, these sorts of CPUs were found primarily in supercomputers, as the supercomputers themselves were, in general, found in places such as weather prediction centers and physics labs, where huge amounts of data are &quot;crunched&quot;. However, as shown above and demonstrated by RISC-V RVV the &quot;efficiency&quot; of vector ISAs brings other benefits which are compelling even for Embedded use-cases.

=== Vector instructions ===
The vector pseudocode example above comes with a big assumption that the vector computer can process more than ten numbers in one batch. For a greater quantity of numbers in the vector register, it becomes unfeasible for the computer to have a register that large. As a result, the vector processor either gains the ability to perform loops itself, or exposes some sort of vector control (status) register to the programmer, usually known as a vector Length.

The self-repeating instructions are found in early vector computers like the STAR-100, where the above action would be described in a single instruction (somewhat like ). They are also found in the x86 architecture as the prefix. However, only very simple calculations can be done effectively in hardware this way without a very large cost increase. Since all operands have to be in memory for the STAR-100 architecture, the latency caused by access became huge too.

Broadcom included space in all vector operations of the Videocore IV ISA for a field, but unlike the STAR-100 which uses memory for its repeats, the Videocore IV repeats are on all operations including arithmetic vector operations. The repeat length can be a small range of power of two or sourced from one of the scalar registers.

The Cray-1 introduced the idea of using processor registers to hold vector data in batches. The batch lengths (vector length, VL) could be dynamically set with a special instruction, the significance compared to Videocore IV (and, crucially as will be shown below, SIMD as well) being that the repeat length does not have to be part of the instruction encoding. This way, significantly more work can be done in each batch; the instruction encoding is much more elegant and compact as well. The only drawback is that in order to take full advantage of this extra batch processing capacity, the memory load and store speed correspondingly had to increase as well. This is sometimes claimed to be a disadvantage of Cray-style vector processors: in reality it is part of achieving high performance throughput, as seen in GPUs, which face exactly the same issue.

Modern SIMD computers claim to improve on early Cray by directly using multiple ALUs, for a higher degree of parallelism compared to only using the normal scalar pipeline. Modern vector processors (such as the SX-Aurora TSUBASA) combine both, by issuing multiple data to multiple internal pipelined SIMD ALUs, the number issued being dynamically chosen by the vector program at runtime. Masks can be used to selectively load and store data in memory locations, and use those same masks to selectively disable processing element of SIMD ALUs. Some processors with SIMD (AVX-512, ARM SVE2) are capable of this kind of selective, per-element (&quot;predicated&quot;) processing, and it is these which somewhat deserve the nomenclature &quot;vector processor&quot; or at least deserve the claim of being capable of &quot;vector processing&quot;. SIMD processors without per-element predication
(MMX, SSE, AltiVec) categorically do not.

Modern GPUs, which have many small compute units each with their own independent SIMD ALUs, use Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT). SIMT units run from a shared single broadcast synchronised Instruction Unit. The &quot;vector registers&quot; are very wide and the pipelines tend to be long. The &quot;threading&quot; part of SIMT involves the way data is handled independently on each of the compute units.

In addition, GPUs such as the Broadcom Videocore IV and other external vector processors like the NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA may use fewer vector units than the width implies: instead of having 64 units for a 64-number-wide register, the hardware might instead do a pipelined loop over 16 units for a hybrid approach. The Broadcom Videocore IV is also capable of this hybrid approach: nominally stating that its SIMD QPU Engine supports 16-long FP array operations in its instructions, it actually does them 4 at a time, as (another) form of &quot;threads&quot;.

=== Vector instruction example ===

This example starts with an algorithm (&quot;IAXPY&quot;), first show it in scalar instructions, then SIMD, then predicated SIMD, and finally vector instructions. This incrementally helps illustrate the difference between a traditional vector processor and a modern SIMD one. The example starts with a 32-bit integer variant of the &quot;DAXPY&quot; function, in C:
void iaxpy(size_t n, int a, const int x[], int y[]) {
 for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
 y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];


In each iteration, every element of y has an element of x multiplied by a and added to it. The program is expressed in scalar linear form for readability.

==== Scalar assembler ====

The scalar version of this would load one of each of x and y, process one calculation, store one result, and loop:
loop:
 load32 r1, x ; load one 32bit data
 load32 r2, y
 mul32 r1, a, r1 ; r1 := r1 * a
 add32 r3, r1, r2 ; r3 := r1 + r2
 store32 r3, y
 addl x, x, $4 ; x := x + 4
 addl y, y, $4
 subl n, n, $1 ; n := n - 1
 jgz n, loop ; loop back if n &gt; 0
out:
 ret
The STAR-like code remains concise, but because the STAR-100&#x27;s vectorisation was by design based around memory accesses, an extra slot of memory is now required to process the information. Two times the latency is also needed due to the extra requirement of memory access.
 ; Assume tmp is pre-allocated
 vmul tmp, a, x, n ; tmp[i] = a * x[i]
 vadd y, y, tmp, n ; y[i] = y[i] + tmp[i]
 ret
==== Pure (non-predicated, packed) SIMD ====

A modern packed SIMD architecture, known by many names (listed in Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy), can do most of the operation in batches. The code is mostly similar to the scalar version. It is assumed that both x and y are properly aligned here (only start on a multiple of 16) and that n is a multiple of 4, as otherwise some setup code would be needed to calculate a mask or to run a scalar version. It can also be assumed, for simplicity, that the SIMD instructions have an option to automatically repeat scalar operands, like ARM NEON can. If it does not, a &quot;splat&quot; (broadcast) must be used, to copy the scalar argument across a SIMD register:
 splatx4 v4, a ; v4 = a,a,a,a
The time taken would be basically the same as a vector implementation of described above.
vloop:
 load32x4 v1, x
 load32x4 v2, y
 mul32x4 v1, a, v1 ; v1 := v1 * a
 add32x4 v3, v1, v2 ; v3 := v1 + v2
 store32x4 v3, y
 addl x, x, $16 ; x := x + 16
 addl y, y, $16
 subl n, n, $4 ; n := n - 4
 jgz n, vloop ; go back if n &gt; 0
out:
 ret
Note that both x and y pointers are incremented by 16, because that is how long (in bytes) four 32-bit integers are. The decision was made that the algorithm &quot;shall&quot; only cope with 4-wide SIMD, therefore the constant is hard-coded into the program.

Unfortunately for SIMD, the clue was in the assumption above, &quot;that n is a multiple of 4&quot; as well as &quot;aligned access&quot;, which, clearly, is a limited specialist use-case.

Realistically, for general-purpose loops such as in portable libraries, where n cannot be limited in this way, the overhead of setup and cleanup for SIMD in order to cope with non-multiples of the SIMD width, can far exceed the instruction count inside the loop itself. Assuming worst-case that the hardware cannot do misaligned SIMD memory accesses, a real-world algorithm will:
* first have to have a preparatory section which works on the beginning unaligned data, up to the first point where SIMD memory-aligned operations can take over. this will either involve (slower) scalar-only operations or smaller-sized packed SIMD operations. Each copy implements the full algorithm inner loop.
* perform the aligned SIMD loop at the maximum SIMD width up until the last few elements (those remaining that do not fit the fixed SIMD width)
* have a cleanup phase which, like the preparatory section, is just as large and just as complex.
Eight-wide SIMD requires repeating the inner loop algorithm first with four-wide SIMD elements, then two-wide SIMD, then one (scalar), with a test and branch in between each one, in order to cover the first and last remaining SIMD elements (0 &lt;= n &lt;= 7).

This more than &quot;triples&quot; the size of the code, in fact in extreme cases it results in an &quot;order of magnitude&quot; increase in instruction count! This can easily be demonstrated by compiling the iaxpy example for AVX-512, using the options to gcc.

Over time as the ISA evolves to keep increasing performance, it results in ISA Architects adding 2-wide SIMD, then 4-wide SIMD, then 8-wide and upwards. It can therefore be seen why AVX-512 exists in x86.

Without predication, the wider the SIMD width the worse the problems get, leading to massive opcode proliferation, degraded performance, extra power consumption and unnecessary software complexity.

Vector processors on the other hand are designed to issue computations of variable length for an arbitrary count, n, and thus require very little setup, and no cleanup. Even compared to those SIMD ISAs which have masks (but no instruction), Vector processors produce much more compact code because they do not need to perform explicit mask calculation to cover the last few elements (illustrated below).

==== Predicated SIMD ====

Assuming a hypothetical predicated (mask capable) SIMD ISA, and again assuming that the SIMD instructions can cope with misaligned data, the instruction loop would look like this:
vloop:
 # prepare mask. few ISAs have min though
 min t0, n, $4 ; t0 = min(n, 4)
 shift m, $1, t0 ; m = 1«t0
 sub m, m, $1 ; m = (1«t0)-1
 # now do the operation, masked by m bits
 load32x4 v1, x, m
 load32x4 v2, y, m
 mul32x4 v1, a, v1, m ; v1 := v1 * a
 add32x4 v3, v1, v2, m ; v3 := v1 + v2
 store32x4 v3, y, m
 # update x, y and n for next loop
 addl x, t0*4 ; x := x + t0*4
 addl y, t0*4
 subl n, n, t0 ; n := n - t0
 # loop?
 jgz n, vloop ; go back if n &gt; 0
out:
 ret
Here it can be seen that the code is much cleaner but a little complex: at least, however, there is no setup or cleanup: on the last iteration of the loop, the predicate mask will be set to either 0b0000, 0b0001, 0b0011, 0b0111 or 0b1111, resulting in between 0 and 4 SIMD element operations being performed, respectively.
One additional potential complication: some RISC ISAs do not have a &quot;min&quot; instruction, needing instead to use a branch or scalar predicated compare.

It is clear how predicated SIMD at least merits the term &quot;vector capable&quot;, because it can cope with variable-length vectors by using predicate masks. The final evolving step to a &quot;true&quot; vector ISA, however, is to not have any evidence in the ISA &quot;at all&quot; of a SIMD width, leaving that entirely up to the hardware.

==== Pure (true) vector ISA ====

For Cray-style vector ISAs such as RVV, an instruction called &quot;&quot; (set vector length) is used. The hardware first defines how many data values it can process in one &quot;vector&quot;: this could be either actual registers or it could be an internal loop (the hybrid approach, mentioned above). This maximum amount (the number of hardware &quot;lanes&quot;) is termed &quot;MVL&quot; (Maximum Vector Length). Note that, as seen in SX-Aurora and Videocore IV, MVL may be an actual hardware lane quantity &quot;or a virtual one&quot;. &quot;(Note: As mentioned in the ARM SVE2 Tutorial, programmers must not make the mistake of assuming a fixed vector width: consequently MVL is not a quantity that the programmer needs to know. This can be a little disconcerting after years of SIMD mindset).&quot;

On calling with the number of outstanding data elements to be processed, &quot;&quot; is permitted (essentially required) to limit that to the Maximum Vector Length (MVL) and thus returns the &quot;actual&quot; number that can be processed by the hardware in subsequent vector instructions, and sets the internal special register, &quot;VL&quot;, to that same amount. ARM refers to this technique as &quot;vector length agnostic&quot; programming in its tutorials on SVE2.

Below is the Cray-style vector assembler for the same SIMD style loop, above. Note that t0 (which, containing a convenient copy of VL, can vary) is used instead of hard-coded constants:
vloop:
 setvl t0, n # VL=t0=min(MVL, n)
 vld32 v0, x # load vector x
 vld32 v1, y # load vector y
 vmadd32 v1, v0, a # v1 += v0 * a
 vst32 v1, y # store Y
 add y, t0*4 # advance y by VL*4
 add x, t0*4 # advance x by VL*4
 sub n, t0 # n -= VL (t0)
 bnez n, vloop # repeat if n != 0
This is essentially not very different from the SIMD version (processes 4 data elements per loop), or from the initial Scalar version (processes just the one). n still contains the number of data elements remaining to be processed, but t0 contains the copy of VL – the number that is &quot;going&quot; to be processed in each iteration. t0 is subtracted from n after each iteration, and if n is zero then all elements have been processed.

A number of things to note, when comparing against the Predicated SIMD assembly variant:
# The instruction has embedded within it a instruction
# Where the SIMD variant hard-coded both the width (4) into the creation of the mask &quot;and&quot; in the SIMD width (load32x4 etc.) the vector ISA equivalents have no such limit. This makes vector programs both portable, Vendor Independent, and future-proof.
# Setting VL effectively &quot;creates a hidden predicate mask&quot; that is automatically applied to the vectors
# Where with predicated SIMD the mask bitlength is limited to that which may be held in a scalar (or special mask) register, vector ISA&#x27;s mask registers have no such limitation. Cray-I vectors could be just over 1,000 elements (in 1977).

Thus it can be seen, very clearly, how vector ISAs reduce the number of instructions.

Also note, that just like the predicated SIMD variant, the pointers to x and y are advanced by t0 times four because they both point to 32 bit data, but that n is decremented by straight t0. Compared to the fixed-size SIMD assembler there is very little apparent difference: x and y are advanced by hard-coded constant 16, n is decremented by a hard-coded 4, so initially it is hard to appreciate the significance. The difference comes in the realisation that the vector hardware could be capable of doing 4 simultaneous operations, or 64, or 10,000, it would be the exact same vector assembler for all of them &quot;and there would still be no SIMD cleanup code&quot;. Even compared to the predicate-capable SIMD, it is still more compact, clearer, more elegant and uses less resources.

Not only is it a much more compact program (saving on L1 Cache size), but as previously mentioned, the vector version can issue far more data processing to the ALUs, again saving power because Instruction Decode and Issue can sit idle.

Additionally, the number of elements going in to the function can start at zero. This sets the vector length to zero, which effectively disables all vector instructions, turning them into no-ops, at runtime. Thus, unlike non-predicated SIMD, even when there are no elements to process there is still no wasted cleanup code.

=== Vector reduction example ===

This example starts with an algorithm which involves reduction. Just as with the previous example, it will be first shown in scalar instructions, then SIMD, and finally vector instructions, starting in c:

void (size_t n, int a, const int x[]) {
 int y = 0;
 for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
 y += x[i];
 return y;


Here, an accumulator (y) is used to sum up all the values in the array, x.

==== Scalar assembler ====

The scalar version of this would load each of x, add it to y, and loop:
 set y, 0 ; y initialised to zero
loop:
 load32 r1, x ; load one 32bit data
 add32 y, y, r1 ; y := y + r1
 addl x, x, $4 ; x := x + 4
 subl n, n, $1 ; n := n - 1
 jgz n, loop ; loop back if n &gt; 0
out:
 ret y ; returns result, y
This is very straightforward. &quot;y&quot; starts at zero, 32 bit integers are loaded one at a time into r1, added to y, and the address of the array &quot;x&quot; moved on to the next element in the array.

==== SIMD reduction ====

This is where the problems start. SIMD by design is incapable of doing arithmetic operations &quot;inter-element&quot;. Element 0 of one SIMD register may be added to Element 0 of another register, but Element 0 may not be added to anything other than another Element 0. This places some severe limitations on potential implementations. For simplicity it can be assumed that n is exactly 8:
 addl r3, x, $16 ; for 2nd 4 of x
 load32x4 v1, x ; first 4 of x
 load32x4 v2, r3 ; 2nd 4 of x
 add32x4 v1, v2, v1 ; add 2 groups
At this point four adds have been performed:
* - First SIMD ADD: element 0 of first group added to element 0 of second group
* - Second SIMD ADD: element 1 of first group added to element 1 of second group

but with 4-wide SIMD being incapable by design of adding for example, things go rapidly downhill just as they did with the general case of using SIMD for general-purpose IAXPY loops. To sum the four partial results, two-wide SIMD can be used, followed by a single scalar add, to finally produce the answer, but, frequently, the data must be transferred out of dedicated SIMD registers before the last scalar computation can be performed.

Even with a general loop (n not fixed), the only way to use 4-wide SIMD is to assume four separate &quot;streams&quot;, each offset by four elements. Finally, the four partial results have to be summed. Other techniques involve shuffle:
examples online can be found for AVX-512 of how to do &quot;Horizontal Sum&quot;

Aside from the size of the program and the complexity, an additional potential problem arises if floating-point computation is involved: the fact that the values are not being summed in strict order (four partial results) could result in rounding errors.

==== Vector ISA reduction ====

Vector instruction sets have arithmetic reduction operations &quot;built-in&quot; to the ISA. If it is assumed that n is less or equal to the maximum vector length, only three instructions are required:
 setvl t0, n # VL=t0=min(MVL, n)
 vld32 v0, x # load vector x
 vredadd32 y, v0 # reduce-add into y
The code when n is larger than the maximum vector length is not that much more complex, and is a similar pattern to the first example (&quot;IAXPY&quot;).
 set y, 0
vloop:
 setvl t0, n # VL=t0=min(MVL, n)
 vld32 v0, x # load vector x
 vredadd32 y, y, v0 # add all x into y
 add x, t0*4 # advance x by VL*4
 sub n, t0 # n -= VL (t0)
 bnez n, vloop # repeat if n != 0
 ret y
The simplicity of the algorithm is stark in comparison to SIMD. Again, just as with the IAXPY example, the algorithm is length-agnostic (even on Embedded implementations where maximum vector length could be only one).

Implementations in hardware may, if they are certain that the right answer will be produced, perform the reduction in parallel. Some vector ISAs offer a parallel reduction mode as an explicit option, for when the programmer knows that any potential rounding errors do not matter, and low latency is critical.

This example again highlights a key critical fundamental difference between true vector processors and those SIMD processors, including most commercial GPUs, which are inspired by features of vector processors.

=== Insights from examples ===

Compared to any SIMD processor claiming to be a vector processor, the order of magnitude reduction in program size is almost shocking. However, this level of elegance at the ISA level has quite a high price tag at the hardware level:
# From the IAXPY example, it can be seen that unlike SIMD processors, which can simplify their internal hardware by avoiding dealing with misaligned memory access, a vector processor cannot get away with such simplification: algorithms are written which inherently rely on Vector Load and Store being successful, regardless of alignment of the start of the vector.
# Whilst from the reduction example it can be seen that, aside from permute instructions, SIMD by definition avoids inter-lane operations entirely (element 0 can only be added to another element 0), vector processors tackle this head-on. What programmers are forced to do in software (using shuffle and other tricks, to swap data into the right &quot;lane&quot;) vector processors must do in hardware, automatically.

Overall then there is a choice to either have
# complex software and simplified hardware (SIMD)
# simplified software and complex hardware (vector processors)

These stark differences are what distinguishes a vector processor from one that has SIMD.

== Vector processor features ==

Where many SIMD ISAs borrow or are inspired by the list below, typical features that a vector processor will have are:

* Vector Load and Store – Vector architectures with a register-to-register design (analogous to load–store architectures for scalar processors) have instructions for transferring multiple elements between the memory and the vector registers. Typically, multiple addressing modes are supported. The unit-stride addressing mode is essential; modern vector architectures typically also support arbitrary constant strides, as well as the scatter/gather (also called &quot;indexed&quot;) addressing mode. Advanced architectures may also include support for &quot;segment&quot; load and stores, and &quot;fail-first&quot; variants of the standard vector load and stores. Segment loads read a vector from memory, where each element is a data structure containing multiple members. The members are extracted from data structure (element), and each extracted member is placed into a different vector register.
* Masked Operations – predicate masks allow parallel if/then/else constructs without resorting to branches. This allows code with conditional statements to be vectorized.
* Compress and Expand – usually using a bit-mask, data is linearly compressed or expanded (redistributed) based on whether bits in the mask are set or clear, whilst always preserving the sequential order and never duplicating values (unlike Gather-Scatter aka permute). These instructions feature in AVX-512.
* Register Gather, Scatter (aka permute) – a less restrictive more generic variation of the compress/expand theme which instead takes one vector to specify the indices to use to &quot;reorder&quot; another vector. Gather/scatter is more complex to implement than compress/expand, and, being inherently non-sequential, can interfere with vector chaining. Not to be confused with Gather-scatter Memory Load/Store modes, Gather/scatter vector operations act on the vector registers, and are often termed a permute instruction instead.
* Splat and Extract – useful for interaction between scalar and vector, these broadcast a single value across a vector, or extract one item from a vector, respectively.
* Iota – a very simple and strategically useful instruction which drops sequentially-incrementing immediates into successive elements. Usually starts from zero.
* Reduction and Iteration – operations that perform mapreduce on a vector (for example, find the one maximum value of an entire vector, or sum all elements). Iteration is of the form codice_1 where Reduction is of the form codice_2
* Matrix Multiply support – either by way of algorithmically loading data from memory, or reordering (remapping) the normally linear access to vector elements, or providing &quot;Accumulators&quot;, arbitrary-sized matrices may be efficiently processed. IBM POWER10 provides MMA instructions although for arbitrary Matrix widths that do not fit the exact SIMD size data repetition techniques are needed which is wasteful of register file resources. NVidia provides a high-level Matrix CUDA API although the internal details are not available. The most resource-efficient technique is in-place reordering of access to otherwise linear vector data.
* Advanced Math formats – often includes Galois field arithmetic, but can include binary-coded decimal or decimal fixed-point, and support for much larger (arbitrary precision) arithmetic operations by supporting parallel carry-in and carry-out
* Bit manipulation – including vectorised versions of bit-level permutation operations, bitfield insert and extract, centrifuge operations, population count, and many others.

=== GPU vector processing features ===

With many 3D shader applications needing trigonometric operations as well as short vectors for common operations (RGB, ARGB, XYZ, XYZW) support for the following is typically present in modern GPUs, in addition to those found in vector processors:

* Sub-vectors – elements may typically contain two, three or four sub-elements (vec2, vec3, vec4) where any given bit of a predicate mask applies to the whole vec2/3/4, not the elements in the sub-vector. Sub-vectors are also introduced in RISC-V RVV (termed &quot;LMUL&quot;). Subvectors are a critical integral part of the Vulkan SPIR-V spec.
* Sub-vector Swizzle – aka &quot;Lane Shuffling&quot; which allows sub-vector inter-element computations without needing extra (costly, wasteful) instructions to move the sub-elements into the correct SIMD &quot;lanes&quot; and also saves predicate mask bits. Effectively this is an in-flight mini-permute of the sub-vector, heavily features in 3D Shader binaries, and is sufficiently important as to be part of the Vulkan SPIR-V spec. The Broadcom Videocore IV uses the terminology &quot;Lane rotate&quot; where the rest of the industry uses the term &quot;swizzle&quot;.
* Transcendentals – trigonometric operations such as sine, cosine and logarithm obviously feature much more predominantly in 3D than in many demanding HPC workloads. Of interest, however, is that speed is far more important than accuracy in 3D for GPUs, where computation of pixel coordinates simply do not require high precision. The Vulkan specification recognises this and sets surprisingly low accuracy requirements, so that GPU Hardware can reduce power usage. The concept of reducing accuracy where it is simply not needed is explored in the MIPS-3D extension.

=== Fault (or Fail) First ===

Introduced in ARM SVE2 and RISC-V RVV is the concept of speculative sequential Vector Loads. ARM SVE2 has a special register named &quot;First Fault Register&quot;, where RVV modifies (truncates) the Vector Length (VL).

The basic principle of is to attempt a large sequential Vector Load, but to allow the hardware to arbitrarily truncate the &quot;actual&quot; amount loaded to either the amount that would succeed without raising a memory fault or simply to an amount (greater than zero) that is most convenient. The important factor is that &quot;subsequent&quot; instructions are notified or may determine exactly how many Loads actually succeeded, using that quantity to only carry out work on the data that has actually been loaded.

Contrast this situation with SIMD, which is a fixed (inflexible) load width and fixed data processing width, unable to cope with loads that cross page boundaries, and even if they were they are unable to adapt to what actually succeeded, yet, paradoxically, if the SIMD program were to even attempt to find out in advance (in each inner loop, every time) what might optimally succeed, those instructions only serve to hinder performance because they would, by necessity, be part of the critical inner loop.

This begins to hint at the reason why is so innovative, and is best illustrated by memcpy or strcpy when implemented with standard 128-bit non-predicated SIMD. For IBM POWER9 the number of hand-optimised instructions to implement strncpy is in excess of 240.
By contrast, the same strncpy routine in hand-optimised RVV assembler is a mere 22 instructions.

The above SIMD example could potentially fault and fail at the end of memory, due to attempts to read too many values: it could also cause significant numbers of page or misaligned faults by similarly crossing over boundaries. In contrast, by allowing the vector architecture the freedom to decide how many elements to load, the first part of a strncpy, if beginning initially on a sub-optimal memory boundary, may return just enough loads such that on &quot;subsequent&quot; iterations of the loop the batches of vectorised memory reads are optimally aligned with the underlying caches and virtual memory arrangements. Additionally, the hardware may choose to use the opportunity to end any given loop iteration&#x27;s memory reads &quot;exactly&quot; on a page boundary (avoiding a costly second TLB lookup), with speculative execution preparing the next virtual memory page whilst data is still being processed in the current loop. All of this is determined by the hardware, not the program itself.

== Performance and speed up ==

Let r be the vector speed ratio and f be the vectorization ratio. If the time taken for the vector unit to add an array of 64 numbers is 10 times faster than its equivalent scalar counterpart, r = 10. Also, if the total number of operations in a program is 100, out of which only 10 are scalar (after vectorization), then f = 0.9, i.e., 90% of the work is done by the vector unit. It follows the achievable speed up of:

formula_1

So, even if the performance of the vector unit is very high (formula_2) there is a speedup less than formula_3, which suggests that the ratio f is crucial to the performance. This ratio depends on the efficiency of the compilation like adjacency of the elements in memory.

<text>Baalbek (; ; ) is a city located east of the Litani River in Lebanon&#x27;s Beqaa Valley, about northeast of Beirut. It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. In 1998, the city had a population of 82,608. Most of the population consists of Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians; in 2017, there was also a large presence of Syrian refugees.

Baalbek has a history that dates back at least 11,000 years, encompassing significant periods such as Prehistoric, Canaanite, Hellenistic, and Roman eras. After Alexander the Great conquered the city in 334 BCE, he renamed it Heliopolis (, Greek for &quot;Sun City&quot;). The city flourished under Roman rule. However, it underwent transformations during the Christianization period and the subsequent rise of Islam following the Arab conquest in the 7th century. In later periods, the city was sacked by the Mongols and faced a series of earthquakes, resulting in a decline in importance during the Ottoman and modern periods.

In the modern era, Baalbek enjoys economic advantages as a sought-after tourist destination. It is known for the ruins of the Roman temple complex, which includes the Temple of Bacchus and the Temple of Jupiter, and was inscribed in 1984 as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other tourist attractions are the &quot;Great Umayyad Mosque&quot;, the Baalbek International Festival, the mausoleum of Sit Khawla, and a Roman quarry site named &quot;Hajar al-Hibla&quot;. Baalbek&#x27;s tourism sector has encountered challenges due to conflicts in Lebanon, particularly the 1975–1990 civil war, the ongoing Syrian civil war since 2011, and the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present).

Baalbek is considered to be part of Hezbollah group&#x27;s heartland and is known to be their political stronghold. During the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), the group managed to overpower the Lebanese army in Baalbek and gain control of the city. The settlement was subsequently used as a base to recruit and train men for attacks against Israeli forces. Hezbollah continues to hold significant political influence and popular support in Baalbek. In the 2022 Lebanese general election the Amal-Hezbollah list won 9 out of 10 seats in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate.

Israel has conducted numerous airstrikes and raids against military and civilian targets in the Baalbek area in the past decades. For instance, in 2006 during the Operation Sharp and Smooth, Israeli commandos raided a hospital and bombed multiple houses, killing two Hezbollah fighters and at least eleven civilians. In 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, Israel sent forced displacement calls for the entire city. Shortly after, Israeli airstrikes killed 19 people, including 8 women.

==Etymology==
A few kilometres from the swamp from which the Litani (the classical Leontes) and the Asi (the upper Orontes) flow, Baalbek may be the same as the &quot;manbaa al-nahrayn&quot; (&quot;Source of the Two Rivers&quot;), the abode of El in the Ugaritic Baal Cycle discovered in the 1920s and a separate serpent incantation.

Baalbek was called &quot;Heliopolis&quot; during the Roman Empire, a latinisation of the Greek &quot;Hēlioúpolis&quot; () used during the Hellenistic period, meaning &quot;Sun City&quot; in reference to the solar cult there. The name is attested under the Seleucids and Ptolemies. However, Ammianus Marcellinus notes that earlier Assyrian names of Levantine towns continued to be used alongside the official Greek ones imposed by the Diadochi, who were successors of Alexander the Great. In Greek religion, Helios was both the sun in the sky and its personification as a god. The local Semitic god Baʿal Haddu was more often equated with Zeus or Jupiter or simply called the &quot;Great God of Heliopolis&quot;, but the name may refer to the Egyptians&#x27; association of Baʿal with their great god Ra. It was sometimes described as or Coelesyria ( or &#x27;) to distinguish it from its namesake in Egypt. In Catholicism, its titular see is distinguished as &quot;&#x27;, from its former Roman province Phoenice. The importance of the solar cult is also attested in the name &quot;Biḳāʿ al-ʿAzīz&quot; borne by the plateau surrounding Baalbek, as it references an earlier solar deity named Aziz. In Greek and Roman antiquity, it was known as &quot;Heliopolis&quot;. Some of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Lebanon are located here, including one of the largest temples of the Roman empire. The gods worshipped there (Jupiter, Venus, and Bacchus) were equivalents of the Canaanite deities Hadad, Atargatis. Local influences are seen in the planning and layout of the temples, which differ from classic Roman design.
The name appears in the Mishnah, a second-century rabbinic text, as a kind of garlic, &quot;shum ba&#x27;albeki&quot; (שום בעלבכי). It appears in two early 5th-century Syriac manuscripts, a translation of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Theophania&quot; and a life of Rabbula, bishop of Edessa. It was pronounced as Baʿlabakk () in Classical Arabic. In Modern Standard Arabic, its vowels are marked as &quot;Baʿlabak&quot; () or &quot;Baʿlabekk&quot;. It is &quot;Bʿalbik&quot; (, is ) in Lebanese Arabic.

The etymology of Baalbek has been debated since the 18th century. Cook took it to mean &quot;Baʿal (Lord) of the Beka&quot; and Donne as &quot;City of the Sun&quot;. Lendering asserts that it is probably a contraction of &quot;Baʿal Nebeq&quot; (&quot;Lord of the Source&quot; of the Litani River). Steiner proposes a Semitic adaption of &quot;Lord Bacchus&quot;, from the classical temple complex.

Nineteenth-century Biblical archaeologists proposed the association of Baalbek with the town of Baalgad in the Book of Joshua; the town of Baalath, one of Solomon&#x27;s cities in the First Book of Kings; Baal-hamon, where Solomon had a vineyard; and the &quot;Plain of Aven&quot; in Book of Amos.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The hilltop of Tell Baalbek, part of a valley to the east of the northern Beqaa Valley (), shows signs of almost continual habitation over the last 8–9000 years. It was well-watered both from a stream running from the &quot;Rās al-ʿAyn&quot; spring southwest of the citadel and, during the spring, from numerous rills formed by meltwater from the Anti-Lebanons. Macrobius later credited the site&#x27;s foundation to a colony of Egyptian or Assyrian priests. The settlement&#x27;s religious, commercial, and strategic importance was minor enough, however, that it is never mentioned in any known Assyrian or Egyptian record, unless under another name. Its enviable position in a fertile valley, major watershed, and along the route from Tyre to Palmyra should have made it a wealthy and splendid site from an early age. During the Canaanite period, the local temples were primarily devoted to the Heliopolitan Triad: a male god (Baʿal), his consort (Astarte), and their son (Adon). The site of the present Temple of Jupiter was probably the focus of earlier worship, as its altar was located at the hill&#x27;s precise summit and the rest of the sanctuary raised to its level.

In Islamic mythology, the temple complex was said to have been a palace of Solomon&#x27;s which was put together by &quot;djinn&quot; and given as a wedding gift to the Queen of Sheba; its actual Roman origin remained obscured by the citadel&#x27;s medieval fortifications as late as the 16th-century visit of the Polish prince Radziwiłł.
===Antiquity===

After Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of Persia in the 330s BC, Baalbek (under its Hellenic name Heliopolis) formed part of the Diadochi kingdoms of Egypt &amp; Syria. It was annexed by the Romans during their eastern wars. The settlers of the Roman colony Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Heliopolitana may have arrived as early as the time of Caesar but were more probably the veterans of the 5th and 8th Legions under Augustus, during which time it hosted a Roman garrison. From 15 BC to AD 193, it formed part of the territory of Berytus. It is mentioned in Josephus, Pliny, Strabo, and Ptolemy and on coins of nearly every emperor from Nerva to Gallienus. The 1st-century Pliny did not number it among the Decapolis, the &quot;Ten Cities&quot; of Coelesyria, while the 2nd-century Ptolemy did. The population likely varied seasonally with market fairs and the schedules of the Indian monsoon and caravans to the coast and interior.
During Classical Antiquity, the city&#x27;s temple to Baʿal Haddu was conflated first with the worship of the Greek sun god Helios and then with the Greek and Roman sky god under the name &quot;Heliopolitan Zeus&quot; or &quot;Jupiter&quot;. The present Temple of Jupiter presumably replaced an earlier one using the same foundation; it was constructed during the mid-1st century and probably completed around AD 60. His idol was a beardless golden god in the pose of a charioteer, with a whip raised in his right hand and a thunderbolt and stalks of grain in his left; its image appeared on local coinage and it was borne through the streets during several festivals throughout the year. Macrobius compared the rituals to those for Diva Fortuna at Antium and says the bearers were the principal citizens of the town, who prepared for their role with abstinence, chastity, and shaved heads. In bronze statuary attested from Byblos in Phoenicia and Tortosa in Spain, he was encased in a pillarlike term and surrounded (like the Greco-Persian Mithras) by busts representing the sun, moon, and five known planets. In these statues, the bust of Mercury is made particularly prominent; a marble stela at Massilia in Transalpine Gaul shows a similar arrangement but enlarges Mercury into a full figure. Local cults also revered the Baetylia, black conical stones considered sacred to Baʿal. One of these was taken to Rome by the emperor Elagabalus, a former priest &quot;of the sun&quot; at nearby Emesa, who erected a temple for it on the Palatine Hill. Heliopolis was a noted oracle and pilgrimage site, whence the cult spread far afield, with inscriptions to the Heliopolitan god discovered in Athens, Rome, Pannonia, Venetia, Gaul, and near the Wall in Britain. The Roman temple complex grew up from the early part of the reign of Augustus in the late 1st century BC until the rise of Christianity in the 4th century. (The 6th-century chronicles of John Malalas of Antioch, which claimed Baalbek as a &quot;wonder of the world&quot;, credited most of the complex to the 2nd-century Antoninus Pius, but it is uncertain how reliable his account is on the point.) By that time, the complex housed three temples on Tell Baalbek: one to Jupiter Heliopolitanus (Baʿal), one to Venus Heliopolitana (Ashtart), and a third to Bacchus. On a nearby hill, a fourth temple was dedicated to the third figure of the Heliopolitan Triad, Mercury (Adon or Seimios). Ultimately, the site vied with Praeneste in Italy as the two largest sanctuaries in the Western world.

The emperor Trajan consulted the site&#x27;s oracle twice. The first time, he requested a written reply to his sealed and unopened question; he was favorably impressed by the god&#x27;s blank reply as his own paper had been empty. He then inquired whether he would return alive from his wars against Parthia and received in reply a centurion&#x27;s vine staff, broken to pieces. In AD 193, Septimius Severus granted the city &quot;ius Italicum&quot; rights. His wife Julia Domna and son Caracalla toured Egypt and Syria in AD 215; inscriptions in their honour at the site may date from that occasion; Julia was a Syrian native whose father had been an Emesan priest &quot;of the sun&quot; like Elagabalus.

The town became a battleground upon the rise of Christianity. Early Christian writers such as Eusebius (from nearby Caesarea) repeatedly execrated the practices of the local pagans in their worship of the Heliopolitan Venus. In AD 297, the actor Gelasinus converted in the middle of a scene mocking baptism; his public profession of faith provoked the audience to drag him from the theater and stone him to death. In the early 4th century, the deacon Cyril defaced many of the idols in Heliopolis; he was killed and (allegedly) cannibalised. Around the same time, Constantine, though not yet a Christian, demolished the goddess&#x27; temple, raised a basilica in its place, and outlawed the locals&#x27; ancient custom of prostituting women before marriage. Bar Hebraeus also credited him with ending the locals&#x27; continued practice of polygamy. The enraged locals responded by raping and torturing Christian virgins. They reacted violently again under the freedom permitted to them by Julian the Apostate. The city was so noted for its hostility to the Christians that Alexandrians were banished to it as a special punishment. The Temple of Jupiter, already greatly damaged by earthquakes, was demolished under Theodosius in 379 and replaced by another basilica (now lost), using stones scavenged from the pagan complex. The &quot;Easter Chronicle&quot; states he was also responsible for destroying all the lesser temples and shrines of the city. Around the year 400, Rabbula, the future bishop of Edessa, attempted to have himself martyred by disrupting the pagans of Baalbek but was only thrown down the temple stairs along with his companion. It became the seat of its own bishop as well. Under the reign of Justinian, eight of the complex&#x27;s Corinthian columns were disassembled and shipped to Constantinople for incorporation in the rebuilt Hagia Sophia sometime between 532 and 537. Michael the Syrian claimed the golden idol of Heliopolitan Jupiter was still to be seen during the reign of Justin II (560s &amp; 570s), and, up to the time of its conquest by the Muslims, it was renowned for its palaces, monuments, and gardens.
===Middle Ages and early modernity===
Baalbek was occupied by the Muslim army in AD 634 ( 13), in 636, or under Abu ʿUbaidah following the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk in 637 ( 16), either peacefully and by agreement or following a heroic defense and yielding of gold, of silver, 2000 silk vests, and 1000 swords. The ruined temple complex was fortified under the name ( &quot;The Fortress&quot;) but was sacked with great violence by the Damascene caliph Marwan II in 748, at which time it was dismantled and largely depopulated. It formed part of the district of Damascus under the Umayyads and Abbasids before being conquered by Fatimid Egypt in 942. In the mid-10th century, it was said to have &quot;gates of palaces sculptured in marble and lofty columns also of marble&quot; and that it was the most &quot;stupendous&quot; and &quot;considerable&quot; location in the whole of Syria. It was sacked and razed by the Byzantines under John I in 974, raided by Basil II in 1000, and occupied by Salih ibn Mirdas, emir of Aleppo, in 1025.

In 1075, it was finally lost to the Fatimids on its conquest by Tutush I, Seljuk emir of Damascus. It was briefly held by Muslim ibn Quraysh, emir of Aleppo, in 1083; after its recovery, it was ruled in the Seljuks&#x27; name by the eunuch Gümüshtegin until he was deposed for conspiring against the usurper Toghtekin in 1110. Toghtekin then gave the town to his son Buri. Upon Buri&#x27;s succession to Damascus on his father&#x27;s death in 1128, he granted the area to his son Muhammad. After Buri&#x27;s murder, Muhammad successfully defended himself against the attacks of his brothers Ismaʿil and Mahmud and gave Baalbek to his vizier Unur. In July 1139, Zengi, atabeg of Aleppo and stepfather of Mahmud, besieged Baalbek with 14 catapults. The outer city held until 10 October and the citadel until the 21st, when Unur surrendered upon a promise of safe passage. In December, Zengi negotiated with Muhammad, offering to trade Baalbek or Homs for Damascus, but Unur convinced the atabeg to refuse. Zengi strengthened its fortifications and bestowed the territory on his lieutenant Ayyub, father of Saladin. Upon Zengi&#x27;s assassination in 1146, Ayyub surrendered the territory to Unur, who was acting as regent for Muhammad&#x27;s son Abaq. It was granted to the eunuch Ata al-Khadim, who also served as viceroy of Damascus.

In December 1151, it was raided by the garrison of Banyas as a reprisal for its role in a Turcoman raid on Banyas. Following Ata&#x27;s murder, his nephew Dahhak, emir of the Wadi al-Taym, ruled Baalbek. He was forced to relinquish it to Nur ad-Din in 1154 after Ayyub had successfully intrigued against Abaq from his estates near Baalbek. Ayyub then administered the area from Damascus on Nur ad-Din&#x27;s behalf. In the mid-12th century, Idrisi mentioned Baalbek&#x27;s two temples and the legend of their origin under Solomon; it was visited by the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela in 1170.

Baalbek&#x27;s citadel served as a jail for Crusaders taken by the Zengids as prisoners of war. In 1171, these captives successfully overpowered their guards and took possession of the castle from its garrison. Muslims from the surrounding area gathered, however, and entered the castle through a secret passageway shown to them by a local. The Crusaders were then massacred.

Three major earthquakes occurred in the 12th century, in 1139, 1157, and 1170. The one in 1170 ruined Baalbek&#x27;s walls and, though Nur ad-Din repaired them, his young heir Ismaʿil was made to yield it to Saladin by a 4-month siege in 1174. Having taken control of Damascus on the invitation of its governor Ibn al-Muqaddam, Saladin rewarded him with the following the Ayyubid victory at the Horns of Hama in 1175. Baldwin, the young leper king of Jerusalem, came of age the next year, ending the Crusaders&#x27; treaty with Saladin. His former regent, Raymond of Tripoli, raided the Beqaa Valley from the west in the summer, suffering a slight defeat at Ibn al-Muqaddam&#x27;s hands. He was then joined by the main army, riding north under Baldwin and Humphrey of Toron; they defeated Saladin&#x27;s elder brother Turan Shah in August at Ayn al-Jarr and plundered Baalbek. Upon the deposition of Turan Shah for neglecting his duties in Damascus, however, he demanded his childhood home of Baalbek as compensation. Ibn al-Muqaddam did not consent and Saladin opted to invest the city in late 1178 to maintain peace within his own family. An attempt to pledge fealty to the Christians at Jerusalem was ignored on behalf of an existing treaty with Saladin. The siege was maintained peacefully through the snows of winter, with Saladin waiting for the &quot;foolish&quot; commander and his garrison of &quot;ignorant scum&quot; to come to terms. Sometime in spring, Ibn al-Muqaddam yielded and Saladin accepted his terms, granting him Baʿrin, Kafr Tab, and al-Maʿarra. The generosity quieted unrest among Saladin&#x27;s vassals through the rest of his reign but led his enemies to attempt to take advantage of his presumed weakness. He did not permit Turan Shah to retain Baalbek very long, though, instructing him to lead the Egyptian troops returning home in 1179 and appointing him to a sinecure in Alexandria. Baalbek was then granted to his nephew Farrukh Shah, whose family ruled it for the next half-century. When Farrukh Shah died three years later, his son Bahram Shah was only a child but he was permitted his inheritance and ruled til 1230. He was followed by al-Ashraf Musa, who was succeeded by his brother as-Salih Ismail, who received it in 1237 as compensation for being deprived of Damascus by their brother al-Kamil. It was seized in 1246 after a year of assaults by as-Salih Ayyub, who bestowed it upon Saʿd al-Din al-Humaidi. When as-Salih Ayyub&#x27;s successor Turan Shah was murdered in 1250, al-Nasir Yusuf, the sultan of Aleppo, seized Damascus and demanded Baalbek&#x27;s surrender. Instead, its emir did homage and agreed to regular payments of tribute.

The Mongolian general Kitbuqa took Baalbek in 1260 and dismantled its fortifications. Later in the same year, however, Qutuz, the sultan of Egypt, defeated the Mongols and placed Baalbek under the rule of their emir in Damascus. Most of the city&#x27;s still-extant fine mosque and fortress architecture dates to the reign of the sultan Qalawun in the 1280s. By the early 14th century, Abulfeda the Hamathite was describing the city&#x27;s &quot;large and strong fortress&quot;. The revived settlement was again destroyed by a flood on 10 May 1318, when water from the east and northeast made holes wide in walls thick. 194 people were killed and 1500 houses, 131 shops, 44 orchards, 17 ovens, 11 mills, and 4 aqueducts were ruined, along with the town&#x27;s mosque and 13 other religious and educational buildings. In 1400, Timur pillaged the town, and there was further destruction from a 1459 earthquake.

===Early modernity===
In 1516, Baalbek was conquered with the rest of Syria by the Ottoman sultan Selim the Grim. In recognition of their prominence among the Shiites of the Beqaa Valley, the Ottomans awarded the sanjak of Homs and local &quot;iltizam&quot; concessions to Baalbek&#x27;s Harfush family. Like the Hamadas, the Harfush emirs were involved on more than one occasion in the selection of Church officials and the running of local monasteries. Tradition holds that many Christians quit the Baalbek region in the eighteenth century for the newer, more secure town of Zahlé on account of the Harfushes&#x27; oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that the Harfushes were closely allied to the Orthodox Ma&#x27;luf family of Zahlé (where indeed Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahlé&#x27;s growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek&#x27;s decline in the eighteenth century. What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite &#x27;Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek in this period to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes, establishing itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even serving as consuls of Iran.

From the 16th century, European tourists began to visit the colossal and picturesque ruins. Donne hyperbolised &quot;No ruins of antiquity have attracted more attention than those of Heliopolis, or been more frequently or accurately measured and described.&quot; Misunderstanding the temple of Bacchus as the &quot;Temple of the Sun&quot;, they considered it the best-preserved Roman temple in the world. The Englishman Robert Wood&#x27;s 1757 &quot;Ruins of Balbec&quot; included carefully measured engravings that proved influential on British and Continental Neoclassical architects. For example, details of the Temple of Bacchus&#x27;s ceiling inspired a bed and ceiling by Robert Adam and its portico inspired that of St George&#x27;s in Bloomsbury.

During the 18th century, the western approaches were covered with attractive groves of walnut trees, but the town itself suffered badly during the 1759 earthquakes, after which it was held by the Metawali, who again feuded with other Lebanese tribes. Their power was broken by Jezzar Pasha, the rebel governor of Acre, in the last half of the 18th century. All the same, Baalbek remained no destination for a traveller unaccompanied by an armed guard. Upon the pasha&#x27;s death in 1804, chaos ensued until Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt occupied the area in 1831, after which it again passed into the hands of the Harfushes. In 1835, the town&#x27;s population was barely 200 people. In 1850, the Ottomans finally began direct administration of the area, making Baalbek a kaza under the Damascus Eyalet and its governor a kaymakam.

===Excavations===

Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany and his wife passed through Baalbek on 1 November 1898, on their way to Jerusalem. He noted both the magnificence of the Roman remains and the drab condition of the modern settlement. It was expected at the time that natural disasters, winter frosts, and the raiding of building materials by the city&#x27;s residents would shortly ruin the remaining ruins. The archaeological team he dispatched began work within a month. Despite finding nothing they could date prior to Baalbek&#x27;s Roman occupation, Otto Puchstein and his associates worked until 1904 and produced a meticulously researched and thoroughly illustrated series of volumes. Later excavations under the Roman flagstones in the Great Court unearthed three skeletons and a fragment of Persian pottery dated to the 6th–4th centuries BC. The sherd featured cuneiform letters.

In 1977, Jean-Pierre Adam made a brief study suggesting most of the large blocks could have been moved on rollers with machines using capstans and pulley blocks, a process which he theorised could use 512 workers to move a block. &quot;Baalbek, with its colossal structures, is one of the finest examples of Imperial Roman architecture at its apogee&quot;, UNESCO reported in making Baalbek a World Heritage Site in 1984. When the committee inscribed the site, it expressed the wish that the protected area include the entire town within the Arab walls, as well as the southwestern extramural quarter between Bastan-al-Khan, the Roman site and the Mameluk mosque of Ras-al-Ain. Lebanon&#x27;s representative gave assurances that the committee&#x27;s wish would be honoured. Recent cleaning operations at the Temple of Jupiter discovered the deep trench at its edge, whose study pushed back the date of Tell Baalbek&#x27;s settlement to the PPNB Neolithic. Finds included pottery sherds including a spout dating to the early Bronze Age. In the summer of 2014, a team from the German Archaeological Institute led by Jeanine Abdul Massih of the Lebanese University discovered a sixth, much larger stone suggested to be the world&#x27;s largest ancient block. The stone was found underneath and next to the Stone of the Pregnant Woman (&quot;Hajjar al-Hibla&quot;) and measures around . It is estimated to weigh .

===Modern history===

Baalbek was connected to the DHP, the French-owned railway concession in Ottoman Syria, on 19 June 1902. It formed a station on the standard-gauge line between Riyaq to its south and Aleppo (now in Syria) to its north. This Aleppo Railway connected to the Beirut–Damascus Railway but—because that line was built to a 1.05-meter gauge—all traffic had to be unloaded and reloaded at Riyaq. Just before the First World War, the population was still around 5000, about 2000 each of Sunnis and Shia Mutawalis and 1000 Orthodox and Maronites. The French general Georges Catroux proclaimed the independence of Lebanon in 1941 but colonial rule continued until 1943. Baalbek still has its railway station but service has been discontinued since the 1970s, originally owing to the Lebanese Civil War.

In March 1974, Musa al-Sadr announced the launching of the &quot;Movement of the Deprived&quot; in front of a rally in Baalbek attended by 75,000 men. Its objective was to stand up for Lebanon&#x27;s neglected Shia community. In his speech he listed grievances with the Lebanese government, including Baalbek&#x27;s lack of a secondary school, Shia communities receiving disproportionately less funds from the national budget, most of the homeless being Shia etc. The occasion was a religious one, and there was celebratory gunfire preceding it. He also announced the setting up of military training camps to train villagers in southern Lebanon to protect their homes from Israeli attacks. These camps led to the creation of the Amal Militia.

By the 2000s, Baalbek was frequently described as a stronghold of Hezbollah, although it also has a large presence of Christians and Sunni Muslims. Many of the city&#x27;s mayors have been Shia, but since 2022, Baalbek has had a Sunni mayor.

=== Israeli–Lebanon conflict ===
In 1978, Israel invaded south Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands of Shia Muslims to flee. As a result of the invasion, when Hassan Nasrallah returned to Lebanon from his studies in Najaf, he was unable to return to his hometown in the south, and instead settled in Baalbek. Abbas al-Musawi also moved to Baalbek.

In 1982, at the height of another Israeli invasion, Amal split into two factions over Nabih Berri&#x27;s acceptance of the American plan to evacuate Palestinians from West Beirut. A large number of dissidents, led by Amal&#x27;s military commander Hussein Musawi moved to Baalbek. Once established in the town the group, which was to evolve into Hizbollah, began to work with Iranian Revolutionary Guards, veterans of the Iran Iraq War. The following year the Iranians established their headquarters in the Sheikh Abdullah barracks in Baalbek. Ultimately there were between 1,500 and 2,000 Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon, with outposts further south in the Shia villages, such as Jebchit.

In 1984, Israel launched raids on Baalbek, killing 100 Lebanese civilians and wounding hundreds inside the city. Israel also bombed a school in the Wavel Palestinian refugee camp next to the city, wounding 150 school children.

On 24/25 June 1999, following elections in Israel and the new administration undecided, the IAF launched two massive air raids across Lebanon. One of the targets was the al Manar radio station&#x27;s offices in a four-storey building in Baalbek which was completely demolished. The attacks also hit Beirut&#x27;s power stations and bridges on the roads to the south. An estimated $52 million damage was caused. Eleven Lebanese were killed as well as two Israelis in Kiryat Shmona.

==== 2006 Lebanon War ====
During the 2006 Lebanon war, many Israeli bombs fell inside the historic Roman town, and some fell as close as 300 meters from the temple of Baalbek. After the war, UNESCO stated that the cracks in the Roman temples had widened. The damage was thought to be due to shockwaves created by the bombs.

More than 250 houses and buildings were destroyed by Israel during the war. Reporters investigating the aftermath found these to be civilian houses and didn&#x27;t find any evidence of military use.

On the evening of 1 August 2006, hundreds of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers raided Baalbek and the Dar al-Hikma or Hikmeh Hospital in Jamaliyeh to its north (&quot;Operation Sharp and Smooth&quot;). Their mission was to rescue two captured soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who were abducted by Hezbollah on 12 July 2006. They were transported by helicopter and supported by Apache helicopters and unmanned drones, The IDF was acting on information that Goldwasser and Regev were at the hospital. al-Jazeera and other sources claimed the IDF was attempting to capture senior Hezbollah officials, particularly Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek. The hospital had been empty for four days, the most unwell patients having been transferred and the rest sent home. No Israelis were killed; Five civilians were abducted and interrogated by the Israelis, presumably because one shared his name with Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah; they were released on August 21.

On August 7, Israel killed 9 civilians in an attack on Brital, just south of Baalbek, and by the subsequent attack on the car leaving the scene for the hospital. A Human Rights Watch investigation showed that none of those killed were combatants, it is likely none were members of Hezbollah, and none of the survivors had any knowledge of any military presence at place of the attack.

On 14 August just before the ceasefire took effect, two Lebanese police and five Lebanese soldiers were killed by a drone strike while driving their van around the still-damaged road through Jamaliyeh.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Baalbek has a mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with significant continental influences. It is located in one of the drier regions of the country, giving it an annual average of of rainfall compared with in coastal areas, overwhelmingly concentrated in the months from November to April. Baalbek has hot rainless summers with cool (and occasionally snowy) winters. Autumn and spring are mild and fairly rainy.

==Demographics==
In 2014, Muslims made up 93.85% and Christians made up 5.66% of registered voters in Baalbek. 59.61% of the voters were Shiite Muslims and 34.24% were Sunni Muslims.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
The Roman ruins have been the setting for the long running Baalbek International Festival.

Baalbek&#x27;s tourism sector suffered significantly due to the Lebanese Civil war (1975–1990). After the civil war ended, tourism gradually saw a resurgence, including opera, orchestras. But it was once again disrupted by Israeli bombings of Baalbek during the 2006 war.

After the 2006 war, conservation work at Lebanon&#x27;s historic sites began in October that year. The ruins at Baalbek were not directly hit by Israeli bombing but the effects of blasts during the conflict toppled a block of stones at the Roman ruins and existing cracks in the temples of Jupiter and Bacchus were feared to have widened. Frederique Husseini, director-general of Lebanon&#x27;s Department of Antiquities, requested $550,000 from Europeans to restore Baalbek&#x27;s souk and another $900,000 for repairs to other damaged structures.

Starting in the early 2000s, Hezbollah organized permanent or temporary exhibitions called &quot;Exposition of the Resistance&quot; which commemorate what is considered to be Lebanese resistance to Israeli occupation. Spanning several hundred square meters, the exhibitions feature defused Israeli weapons, recreated scenes of war, and photos and videos of Lebanese people killed by Israel. Starting in 2009, Hezbollah setup an exhibition to commemorate the 2006 war.

During the Syrian civil war, the UK FCO designated areas close to the Syrian border, including Baalbek and the rest of Beqaa valley, as &quot;red zone&quot; – advising against all travel. The US State Department made a similar designation. These designations, prompted by perceived proximity to Syria and clashes between Sunnis and Alawites, discouraged international tourism.

During its 2024 invasion of Lebanon, Israel bombed a restaurant frequented by tourists and damaged the historic Hotel Palmyra. In November, UNESCO gave Baalbek enhanced protection to safeguard against damage to the archaeological site during the invasion; it was one of 34 areas to receive this protection.

== Ruins ==

The Tell Baalbek temple complex, fortified as the town&#x27;s citadel during the Middle Ages, was constructed from local stone, mostly white granite and a rough white marble. Over the years, it has suffered from the region&#x27;s numerous earthquakes, the iconoclasm of Christian and Muslim lords, and the reuse of the temples&#x27; stone for fortification and other construction. The temples also suffered minor damage from the shockwaves generated by nearby Israeli bombings in the 2006 Lebanon war. The nearby Qubbat Duris, a 13th-century Muslim shrine on the old road to Damascus, is built out of granite columns, apparently removed from Baalbek. Further, the jointed columns were once banded together with iron; many were gouged open or toppled by the emirs of Damascus to get at the metal. As late as the 16th century, the Temple of Jupiter still held 27 standing columns out of an original 58; there were only nine before the 1759 earthquakes and six today.

The complex is located on a raised plaza erected over an earlier T-shaped base consisting of a podium, staircase, and foundation walls. These walls were built from about 24 monoliths, at their lowest level weighing approximately each. The tallest retaining wall, on the west, has a second course of monoliths containing the famous &quot;Three Stones&quot; (, &quot;Trílithon&quot;): a row of three stones, each over long, high, and broad, cut from limestone. They weigh approximately each. A fourth, still larger stone is called the Stone of the Pregnant Woman: it lies unused in a nearby quarry from the town. Its weight is estimated at . A fifth, still larger stone weighing approximately lies in the same quarry. This quarry was slightly higher than the temple complex, so no lifting was required to move the stones.

The temple complex was entered from the east through the Propylaea (, &quot;propýlaion&quot;) or Portico, consisting of a broad staircase rising to an arcade of 12 columns flanked by 2 towers. Most of the columns have been toppled and the stairs were entirely dismantled for use in the nearby later wall, but a Latin inscription remains on several of their bases stating that Longinus, a lifeguard of the 1st Parthian Legion, and Septimius, a freedman, gilded their capitals with bronze in gratitude for the safety of Septimius Severus&#x27;s son Antoninus Caracalla and empress Julia Domna.

Immediately behind the Propylaeum is a hexagonal forecourt reached through a threefold entrance that was added in the mid-3rd century by the emperor Philip the Arab. Traces remain of the two series of columns which once encircled it, but its original function remains uncertain. Donne reckoned it as the town&#x27;s forum. Badly preserved coins of the era led some to believe this was a sacred cypress grove, but better specimens show that the coins displayed a single stalk of grain instead.

The rectangular Great Court to its west covers around and included the main altar for burnt offering, with mosaic-floored lustration basins to its north and south, a subterranean chamber, and three underground passageways wide by high, two of which run east and west and the third connecting them north and south, all bearing inscriptions suggesting their occupation by Roman soldiers. These were surrounded by Corinthian porticoes, one of which was never completed. The columns&#x27; bases and capitals were of limestone; the shafts were monoliths of highly polished red Egyptian granite high. Six remain standing, out of an original 128. Inscriptions attest that the court was once adorned by portraits of Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s daughter Sabina, Septimius Severus, Gordian, and Velius Rufus, dedicated by the city&#x27;s Roman colonists. The entablature was richly decorated but is now mostly ruined. A westward-facing basilica was constructed over the altar during the reign of Theodosius; it was later altered to make it eastward-facing like most Christian churches.

The Temple of Jupiter—once wrongly credited to Helios—lay at the western end of the Great Court, raised another on a platform reached by a wide staircase. Under the Byzantines, it was also known as the &quot;Trilithon&quot; from the three massive stones in its foundation and, when taken together with the forecourt and Great Court, it is also known as the Great Temple. The Temple of Jupiter proper was circled by a peristyle of 54 unfluted Corinthian columns: 10 in front and back and 19 along each side. The temple was ruined by earthquakes, destroyed and pillaged for stone under Theodosius, and 8 columns were taken to Constantinople (Istanbul) under Justinian for incorporation into the Hagia Sophia. Three fell during the late 18th century. 6 columns, however, remain standing along its south side with their entablature. Their capitals remain nearly perfect on the south side, while the Beqaa&#x27;s winter winds have worn the northern faces almost bare. The architrave and frieze blocks weigh up to each, and one corner block over , all of them raised to a height of above the ground. Individual Roman cranes were not capable of lifting stones this heavy. They may have simply been rolled into position along temporary earthen banks from the quarry. The Julio-Claudian emperors enriched its sanctuary in turn. In the mid-1st century, Nero built the tower-altar opposite the temple. In the early 2nd century, Trajan added the temple&#x27;s forecourt, with porticos of pink granite shipped from Aswan at the southern end of Egypt.

The Temple of Bacchus—once wrongly credited to Jupiter—may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s, as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter. It is the best preserved of the sanctuary&#x27;s structures, as the other rubble from its ruins protected it. It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity. The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns—8 along each end and 15 along each side—nearly in height. These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded, polished, and decorated in position. The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood, but the keystone of the lintel had slid following the 1759 earthquakes; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or &#x27;70s to support it. The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit&#x27;s famed inscription of an eagle, which was entirely covered by the keystone&#x27;s supporting column. The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake. The interior of the temple is divided into a nave and a adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised above it and fronted by 13 steps. The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune, Triton, Arion and his dolphin, and other marine figures but these have been lost. The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications, although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688. Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate, but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria&#x27;s governor Rashid Pasha. Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof.

The Temple of Venus—also known as the Circular Temple or Nymphaeum—was added under Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century but destroyed under Constantine, who raised a basilica in its place. Jessup considered it the &quot;gem of Baalbek&quot;. It lies about from the southeast corner of the Temple of Bacchus. It was known in the 19th century as &quot;El Barbara&quot; or &quot;Barbarat el-Atikah&quot; (St Barbara&#x27;s), having been used as a Greek Orthodox church into the 18th century.

The ancient walls of Heliopolis had a circumference of a little less than . Much of the extant fortifications around the complex date to the 13th century reconstruction undertaken by the Mamluk sultan Qalawun following the devastation of the earlier defenses by the Mongol army under Kitbuqa. This includes the great southeast tower. The earliest round of fortifications were two walls to the southwest of the Temples of Jupiter and Bacchus. The original southern gateway with two small towers was filled in and replaced by a new large tower flanked by curtains, probably under Buri or Zengi. Bahramshah replaced that era&#x27;s southwest tower with one of his own in 1213 and built another in the northwest in 1224; the west tower was probably strengthened around the same time. An inscription dates the barbican-like strengthening of the southern entrance to around 1240. Qalawun relocated the two western curtains nearer to the western tower, which was rebuilt with great blocks of stone. The barbican was repaired and more turns added to its approach. From around 1300, no alterations were made to the fortifications apart from repairs such as Sultan Barkuk&#x27;s restoration of the moat in preparation for Timur&#x27;s arrival.

Material from the ruins is incorporated into a ruined mosque north of downtown and probably also in the Qubbat Duris on the road to Damascus. In the 19th century, a &quot;shell-topped canopy&quot; from the ruins was used nearby as a mihrab, propped up to show locals the direction of Mecca for their daily prayers.

===Tomb of Husayn&#x27;s daughter===
Under a white dome further towards town is the tomb of Khawla, daughter of Hussein and granddaughter of Ali, who died in Baalbek while Husayn&#x27;s family was being transported as prisoners to Damascus.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Heliopolis (in Phoenicia; not to be confused with the Egyptian bishopric Heliopolis in Augustamnica) was a bishopric under Roman and Byzantine rule, but it disappeared due to the Islamic rule.

In 1701, Eastern Catholics (Byzantine Rite) established anew an Eparchy of Baalbek, which in 1964 was promoted to the present Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Baalbek.

=== Titular see ===
In the Latin Church, the Ancient diocese was only nominally restored (no later than 1876) as Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis (Latin) / Eliopoli (Curiate Italian), demoted in 1925 to Episcopal Titular bishopric, promoted back in 1932, with its name changed (avoiding Egyptian confusion) in 1933 to (non-Metropolitan) Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis in Phoenicia.

<text>François-Noël Babeuf (; 23 November 1760 – 27 May 1797), also known as Gracchus Babeuf, was a French proto-communist, revolutionary, and journalist of the French Revolutionary period. His newspaper &quot;Le tribun du peuple&quot; (&quot;The Tribune of the People&quot;) was best known for its advocacy for the poor and calling for a popular revolt against the Directory, the government of France. He was a leading advocate for democracy and the abolition of private property. He angered the authorities who were clamping down hard on their radical enemies. In spite of the efforts of his Jacobin friends to save him, Babeuf was executed for his role in the Conspiracy of the Equals.

The nickname &quot;Gracchus&quot; likened him to the Gracchi brothers, who served as tribunes of the people in ancient Rome. Although the terms &quot;anarchist&quot;, &quot;communist&quot; and &quot;socialist&quot; were not largely used in Babeuf&#x27;s lifetime, they have all been used by later scholars to describe his ideas. &quot;Communism&quot; was first used in English by John Goodwyn Barmby in a conversation with those he described as the &quot;disciples of Babeuf&quot;. He has been called &quot;The First Revolutionary Communist.&quot;

About his political philosophy, Babeuf wrote: &quot;Society must be made to operate in such a way that it eradicates once and for all the desire of a man to become richer, or wiser, or more powerful than others.&quot; In the &quot;Manifesto of the Equals,&quot; a piece of writing commissioned by Babeuf, Sylvain Maréchal wrote that &quot;[the] French Revolution [was] nothing but a precursor of another revolution, one that will be greater, more solemn, and which will be the last.&quot;

== Early life ==
Babeuf was born at St. Nicaise near the town of Saint-Quentin. His father, Claude Babeuf, had deserted the French Royal Army in 1738 for the Austrian Imperial Army, reportedly rising to the rank of major. Amnestied in 1755, he returned to France, but soon sank into poverty, and had to work as a casual labourer to support his family. The hardships endured by Babeuf during his early years contributed to the development of his political opinions. His father gave him a basic education, but until the outbreak of the Revolution, he was a domestic servant, and from 1785 occupied the office of (commissary of land records), assisting the nobles and priests in the assertion of their feudal rights over the peasants. Accused of abandoning the feudal aristocracy, he would later say that &quot;the sun of the French Revolution&quot; had brought him to view his &quot;mother, the feudal system&quot; as a &quot;hydra with a hundred heads.&quot;

== Revolutionary activities ==
Babeuf was working for a land surveyor at Roye when the Revolution began. His father had died in 1780, and he now had to provide for his wife and two children, as well as for his mother, brothers and sisters.

He was a prolific writer, and the signs of his future socialism are contained in a letter of 21 March 1787, one of a series mainly on literature and addressed to the secretary of the Academy of Arras. In 1789 he drew up the first article of the of the electors of the &quot;bailliage&quot; of Roye, demanding the abolition of feudal rights. From July to October 1789, he lived in Paris, superintending the publication of his first work: (&quot;National Cadastre or land register, Dedicated to the National Assembly, Year 1789 and the First One of French Liberty&quot;), which was written in 1789 and issued in 1790. The same year he published a pamphlet against feudal aids and the &quot;gabelle&quot; (salt tax), for which he was denounced and arrested, but provisionally released.

=== Political writings and imprisonment ===
In October, on his return to Roye, he founded the , a political journal that would have 40 issues. Babeuf used his journal to agitate for a progressive taxation system, and condemned the &quot;census suffrage&quot; planned for the 1791 elections to the Legislative Assembly in which citizen votes would be weighted by their social standing. Due to his political activities, he was arrested on 19 May 1790, but released in July before the Fête de la Fédération, thanks to pressure exerted nationally by Jean-Paul Marat. In November Babeuf was elected a member of the municipality of Roye, but was expelled.

In March 1791, Babeuf was appointed commissioner to report on the national property () in the town, and in September 1792 was elected a member of the council-general of the of the Somme. A rivalry with the principal administrator and later deputy to the Convention, André Dumont, forced Babeuf to transfer to the post of administrator of the district of Montdidier. There he was accused of fraud for having altered a name in a deed of transfer of national lands. The error was probably due to negligence; but, distrusting the impartiality of the judges of the Somme, he fled to Paris, and on 23 August 1793 was sentenced &quot;in contumaciam&quot; to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment. Meanwhile, he had been appointed secretary to the relief committee () of the Paris Commune.

The judges of Amiens pursued him with a warrant for his arrest, which took place in Brumaire of the year II (1793). The Court of Cassation quashed the sentence, through defect of form, and sent Babeuf for a new trial before the Aisne tribunal, which acquitted him on 18 July 1794, only days before the Thermidorian Reaction.

Babeuf returned to Paris, and on 3 September 1794 published the first issue of his (&quot;Journal of the Freedom of the Press&quot;), whose title was changed on 5 October 1794 to (&quot;The Tribune of the People&quot;). The execution of Maximilien Robespierre on 28 July 1794 had ended the Reign of Terror and begun the White Terror. Babeuf – now self-styled &quot;Gracchus&quot; Babeuf – defended the fallen Terror politicians with the stated goal of achieving equality &quot;in fact&quot; and not only &quot;by proclamation&quot;. However about the Terror, he said &quot;I object to this particular aspect of their system.&quot; Babeuf attacked the leaders of the Thermidorian Reaction and, from a socialistic point of view, the economic outcome of the Revolution. He also argued for the inclusion of women into the political clubs.

This was an attitude which had few supporters, even in the Jacobin Club, and in October Babeuf was arrested and imprisoned at Arras. Here he was influenced by political prisoners, notably Philippe Buonarroti, Simon Duplay, and René-François Lebois, editor of the (&quot;Journal of Equality&quot;) and afterwards of the (&quot;The Friend of the People&quot;) papers of Leclerc which carried on the traditions of Jean-Paul Marat. Babeuf emerged from prison a confirmed advocate of revolution and convinced that his project, fully proclaimed to the world in Issue 33 of his , could come about only through the restoration of the Constitution of 1793. That constitution had been ratified by a national referendum by universal male suffrage but never implemented.

In February 1795, Babeuf was arrested again, and the was solemnly burnt in the by the , young men whose mission was to root out Jacobinism. Babeuf might have faded into obscurity like other agitators, but for the appalling economic conditions caused by the fall in the value of .

=== Conspiracy of the Equals ===

The attempts of the Directory to deal with the economic crisis gave Babeuf his historical importance. The new government wanted to abolish the system which benefitted Paris at the expense of all France. To this goal, the government planned to abolish the sale of bread and meat at nominal prices, on 20 February 1796. The announcement caused widespread consternation. Workers and the large class of proletarians attracted to Paris by the system, as well as and government officials, whose incomes were paid in arbitrarily set by the government, felt threatened with starvation. The government yielded to the outcry, and tried to mitigate the problem by dividing people entitled to relief into classes, but this only increased alarm and discontent.

The universal misery gave point to Babeuf&#x27;s virulent attacks on the existing order and gained him a hearing. He gained a small circle of followers known as the (&quot;Society of the Equals&quot;), soon merged with the rump of the Jacobin Club, who met at the Panthéon. In November 1795, police reported that Babeuf was openly preaching &quot;insurrection, revolt and the Constitution of 1793&quot;. The group was influenced by Sylvain Maréchal, the author of (&quot;The Manifesto of the Equals&quot;) and a sympathiser of Babeuf.

For a time, the government left Babeuf alone but observed his activities. The Directory benefitted from the leftist agitation because it counteracted royalist movements for overthrowing the Directory. Most workers, even of extreme views, were repelled by Babeuf&#x27;s bloodthirstiness; and police reported that his agitation increased support for the government. The Jacobin Club refused to admit Babeuf and Lebois, on the ground that they were &quot;throat-cutters&quot; ().

However, the economic crisis increased Babeuf&#x27;s influence. After Napoleon Bonaparte closed the club of the Panthéon on 27 February 1796, Babeuf increased his activity. In Ventôse and Germinal (late winter and early spring) under the pseudonym , Babeuf published the paper &quot;Scout of the People, or Defender of Twenty-Five Million Oppressed&quot; (), which was passed from group to group secretly in the streets of Paris.

At the same time, Issue 40 of Babeuf&#x27;s caused immense sensation as it praised the authors of the September Massacres as &quot;deserving well of their country&quot; and declared that a more complete &quot;2 September&quot; was needed to destroy the government, which consisted of &quot;starvers, bloodsuckers, tyrants, hangmen, rogues and mountebanks&quot;.

Distress among all classes continued. In March, the Directory tried to replace by a new issue of and this raised hopes, but they were soon dashed. A rumour that national bankruptcy had been declared caused thousands of the lower class of workers to rally to Babeuf&#x27;s ideas. On 4 April 1796, the government received a report that 500,000 Parisians needed relief. From 11 April, Paris was placarded with posters headed &quot;Analysis of Babeuf&#x27;s Teaching&quot; () &quot;, Tribun du Peuple&quot;, which began with the sentence &quot;Nature has given to every man the right to the enjoyment of an equal share in all property&quot;, and ended with a call to restore the Constitution of 1793.

=== Arrest and execution ===
Babeuf&#x27;s song &quot;Dying of Hunger, Dying of Cold&quot; (), set to a popular tune, began to be sung in , with immense applause. Reports circulated that the disaffected troops of the French Revolutionary Army in the camp of Grenelle were ready to join an insurrection against the government. The had accumulated through its agents (notably ex-captain Georges Grisel, who was initiated into Babeuf’s society) evidence of a conspiracy (later called the Conspiracy of Equals) for an armed uprising fixed for 22 Floréal, year IV (11 May 1796), which involved Jacobins and leftists.

The Directory thought it time to react. On 10 May Babeuf, who had taken the pseudonym &quot;Tissot&quot;, was arrested. Many of his associates were gathered by the police on order from Lazare Carnot: among them were Augustin Alexandre Darthé and Philippe Buonarroti, the ex-members of the National Convention, Robert Lindet, Jean-Pierre-André Amar, Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier and Jean-Baptiste Drouet, famous as the postmaster of Sainte-Menehould who had arrested Louis XVI during the latter&#x27;s Flight to Varennes, and now a member of the Directory&#x27;s Council of Five Hundred. The government crackdown was extremely successful. The last issue of the appeared on 24 April, although René-François Lebois in the tried to incite the soldiers to revolt, and for a while there were rumours of a military uprising. 

Babeuf and his accomplices were to be tried at the newly created high court at Vendôme. When the prisoners were removed from Paris on 10 and 11 Fructidor (27 August and 28 August 1796), there were tentative efforts at a riot hoping to rescue the prisoners, but these were easily suppressed. On 7 September 1796, 500 or 600 Jacobins tried to rouse the soldiers at Grenelle but also failed. The trial was held at Vendôme beginning on 20 February 1797. Although several people were involved in the conspiracy, the government depicted Babeuf as the leader. On 7 Prairial (26 May 1797) Babeuf and Darthé were condemned to death; some of the prisoners, including Buonarroti, were deported; the rest, including Vadier and his fellow-conventionals, were acquitted. Drouet managed to escape, according to Paul Barras, with the connivance of the Directory. Babeuf and Darthé were guillotined the next day at Vendôme, 8 Prairial (27 May 1797), without appeal. Babeuf&#x27;s body was transported and buried in a mass grave in the Vendôme&#x27;s old cemetery of the Grand Faubourg, in Loir-et-Cher.

<text>Churchill Babington (; 11 March 182112 January 1889) was an English classical scholar, archaeologist and naturalist. He served as Rector of Cockfield, Suffolk. He was a cousin of Cardale Babington.

== Life ==
He was born at Rothley Temple, in Leicestershire, the only son of Matthew Drake Babington. He was a scion of the Babington family. He was first educated by his father, and then studied under Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, the orientalist and archaeologist. In 1839, he followed his cousin, Cardale, to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and graduated in 1843, seventh in the first class of the classical tripos and a &quot;senior optime&quot;. In 1845 he obtained the Hulsean Prize for his essay &quot;The Influence of Christianity in promoting the Abolition of Slavery in Europe&quot;. In 1846, he was elected to a fellowship and took orders. He proceeded to the degree of M.A. in 1846 and D.D. in 1879. From 1848 to 1861, he was vicar of Horningsea, near Cambridge, and from 1866 to his death he was vicar of Cockfield in Suffolk. From 1865 to 1880, he held the Disney professorship of archaeology at Cambridge. In his lectures, illustrated from his own collections of coins and vases, he dealt chiefly with Greek and Ancient Roman pottery and numismatics.

Babington wrote on a variety of subjects. His early familiarity with country life gave him a taste for natural history, especially botany and ornithology. He was also an authority on conchology. He collected on field trips along with many others including Edward Byles Cowell. He was among the few to record the endangered eskimo curlew in England. He was the author of the appendices on botany (in part) and ornithology in Potter&#x27;s &quot;History and Antiquities of Charnwood Forest&quot; (1842). In 1853, he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society.

His family was connected with that of the Macaulays and he wrote &quot;Mr Macaulay&#x27;s Character of the Clergy&quot; (1849), a defence of the clergy of the 17th Century, which received the approval of Gladstone. He also brought out the &quot;editio princeps&quot; of the speeches of Hypereides &quot;Against Demosthenes&quot; (1850), &quot;On Behalf of Lycophron and Euxenippus&quot; (1853) and his &quot;Funeral Oration&quot; (1858). It was by his edition of these speeches from the papyri discovered at Thebes (Egypt) in 1847 and 1856 that Babington&#x27;s fame as a Greek scholar was made.

In 1855, he published an edition of &quot;Benefizio della Morte di Cristo&quot;, a remarkable book of the Reformation period, attributed to Paleario, of which nearly all the copies had been destroyed by the Inquisition. Babington&#x27;s edition was a facsimile of the &quot;editio princeps&quot; published at Venice in 1543, with an Introduction and French and English versions. He also edited the first two volumes of Higden&#x27;s &quot;Polychronicon&quot; (1858) and Bishop Pecock&#x27;s &quot;Represser of Overmuch Blaming of the Clergy&quot; (1860); &quot;Introductory Lecture on Archaeology&quot; (1865); &quot;Roman Antiquities found at Rougham&quot; (1872); &quot;Catalogue of Birds of Suffolk&quot; (1884–1886); &quot;Flora of Suffolk&quot; (with William Marsden Hind, 1889), etc. He catalogued the classical manuscripts in the University Library and the Greek and English coins in the Fitzwilliam Museum.

He died of rheumatic fever and was survived only by his widow, daughter of Colonel John Alexander Wilson.

<doc id="58216" wikidata="Q326653" url="?curid=58216" title="Accountant">
<text>An accountant is a practitioner of accounting or accountancy.
Accountants who have demonstrated competency through their professional associations&#x27; certification exams are certified to use titles such as Chartered Accountant, Chartered Certified Accountant or Certified Public Accountant, or Registered Public Accountant. Such professionals are granted certain responsibilities by statute, such as the ability to certify an organization&#x27;s financial statements, and may be held liable for professional misconduct. Non-qualified accountants may be employed by a qualified accountant, or may work independently without statutory privileges and obligations.

Cahan &amp; Sun (2015) used archival study to find out that accountants&#x27; personal characteristics may exert a very significant impact during the audit process and further influence audit fees and audit quality. Practitioners have been portrayed in popular culture by the stereotype of the humorless, introspective bean-counter. It has been suggested that the stereotype has an influence on those attracted to the profession with many new entrants underestimating the importance of communication skills and overestimating the importance of numeracy in the role.

An accountant may either be hired for a firm that requires accounting services on a continuous basis, or may belong to an accounting firm that provides accounting consulting services to other firms. The Big Four auditors are the largest employers of accountants worldwide. However, most accountants are employed in commerce, industry, and the public sector.

==Commonwealth of Nations==

In the Commonwealth of Nations, which include the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong pre-1997, and several other states, commonly recognised accounting qualifications are Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA), Chartered Accountant (CA or ACA), Certified Management Accountant (Institute of Certified Management Accountants) (CMA), Chartered Management Accountant (ACMA) and International Accountant (AAIA). Other qualifications in particular countries include Certified Public Accountant (CPA – Ireland and CPA – Hong Kong), Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA – Canada), Certified Management Accountant (Institute of Certified Management Accountants|CMA – Australia) (CMA – Sri Lanka), Certified Practising Accountant (CPA – Australia) and members of the Institute of Public Accountants (Australia), and Certified Public Practising Accountant (CPPA – New Zealand).

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) received its Royal Charter in 1854 and is the world&#x27;s first professional body of accountants.

==United Kingdom and Ireland==

* A Chartered Accountant must be a member of one of the following:
** the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) (designatory letters ACA or FCA)
** the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) (designatory letters CA)
** Chartered Accountants Ireland (CAI)
** a recognised equivalent body from another Commonwealth country (designatory letters being CA (name of country) e.g. CA (Australia))
* A Chartered Certified Accountant must be a member of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (designatory letters ACCA or FCCA).
* A Chartered Management Accountant must be a member of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (designatory letters ACMA or FCMA).
* A Chartered Public Finance Accountant must be a member of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (designatory letters CPFA).
* An International Accountant is a member of the Association of International Accountants (designatory letters AAIA or FAIA). 
* An Incorporated Financial Accountant is a member of the Institute of Financial Accountants (designatory letters IFA, AFA or FFA).
* A Certified Public Accountant may be a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (designatory letters AICPA) or its equivalent in another country, and is usually designated as such after passing the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination. (designatory letters CPA)
* A Public Accountant may be a member of the Institute of Public Accountants (designatory letters AIPA, MIPA or FIPA).
*Registered Qualified Accountant may be a member of Accountants Institute (designatory letters RQA, and FQA for Fellow Members), based in Slovenia

Excepting the Association of Certified Public Accountants, each of the above bodies admits members only after passing examinations and undergoing a period of relevant work experience. Once admitted, members are expected to comply with ethical guidelines and gain appropriate professional experience.

Chartered, Chartered Certified, Chartered Public Finance, and International Accountants engaging in practice (i.e. selling services to the public rather than acting as an employee) must gain a &quot;practising certificate&quot; by meeting further requirements such as purchasing adequate insurance and undergoing inspections.

The ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI, ACCA and AAPA are five Recognised Supervisory Bodies (RSB) in the UK. A member of one of them may also become a &quot;Statutory Auditor&quot; in accordance with the Companies Act, providing they can demonstrate the necessary professional ability in that area and submit to regular inspection. It is illegal for any individual or firm that is not a Statutory Auditor to perform a company audit.

The ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI, ACCA, AIA and CIPFA are six recognised qualifying bodies statutory (RQB) in the UK. A member of one of them may also become a &quot;Statutory Auditor&quot; in accordance with the Companies Act, providing they are a member of one of the five Recognised Supervisory Bodies RSB mentioned above.

All six RQBs are listed under EU mutual recognition directives to practise in 27 EU member states and individually entered into agreement with the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA).

Further restrictions apply to accountants who carry out insolvency work.

In addition to the bodies above, technical qualifications are offered by the Association of Accounting Technicians, ACCA and AIA, which are respectively called AAT Technician, CAT (Certified Accounting Technician) and IAT (International Accounting Technician).

==United States==

In the United States, licensed accountants are Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), and in certain states, Public Accountants (PAs). Unlicensed accountants may be Certified Internal Auditors (CIAs) and Certified Management Accountants (CMAs). The difference between these certifications is primarily the legal status and the types of services provided, although individuals may earn more than one certification. Additionally, much accounting work is performed by uncertified individuals, who may be working under the supervision of a certified accountant. As noted above, the majority of accountants work in the private sector or may offer their services without the need for certification.

The training time required for accountancy certification in the US requires specific guidelines:
* Certificate: Several months to a year
* Associate degree: One–two years
* Bachelor&#x27;s degree: Three–four years
* CPA: Five years of education (150 semester college credits) plus one–two years of work experience (length of work experience requirement depends on which state is granting the license)
* Master&#x27;s degree: One–two years
* Doctoral degree: Three–five years

A CPA is licensed by a state to provide auditing services to the public. Many CPA firms also offer accounting, tax, litigation support, and other financial advisory services. The requirements for receiving the CPA license vary from state to state, although the passage of the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination is required by all states. This examination is designed and graded by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

A PA (sometimes referred to as LPA—Licensed Public Accountant) is licensed by the state to practice accountancy to the same extent as are CPAs, although in some states PAs are not permitted to perform audits or reviews (notably Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, &amp; South Carolina). A PA&#x27;s ability to practice out of state is very limited due to most states having phased out the PA designation. While most states no longer accept new PA license applicants, four states still accept PA applicants for practice privileges within the state. As with the CPA, the requirements for receiving the PA license vary from state to state. Most states require a passage of either two or three (out of four) sections of the CPA exam or passage of the Comprehensive Examination for Accreditation in Accounting which is administered and graded by the Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT).

A certified internal auditor (CIA) is granted a certificate from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), provided that the candidate has passed a four-part examination. One of the four parts is waived if the candidate has already passed the CPA Exam. A CIA typically provides services directly to an employer rather than to the public.

A person holding the Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) is granted the certificate by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), provided that the candidate has passed an examination of two parts and has met the practical experience requirement of the IMA. A CMA provides services directly to employers rather than to the public. A CMA can also provide services to the public, but to an extent much lesser than that of a CPA.

An Enrolled Agent (EA) is a federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Enrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS, unlimited rights of representation. The EA credential is recognized across all 50 U.S. states. Candidates must pass a three-part exam (called the Special Enrollment Examination) covering the subjects of individual tax, business tax, and client representation, or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in these areas.

The United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there are about one million persons employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.

U.S. tax laws grant CPAs and EAs a form of accountant–client privilege.

===Non-certified accountants===
==Australia==
In Australia, there are three legally recognised local professional accounting bodies which all enjoy the same recognition and can be considered as &quot;qualified accountant&quot;: the Institute of Public Accountants (IPA), CPA Australia (CPA) and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ). Other international bodies such as ACCA (The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) enjoy recognition for the purposes of supporting their members in their careers. For instance, ACCA has achieved recognition by the Tax Practitioner Board, as Tax and BAS agents, in 2010.

==Canada==
In Canada, a Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) must be a member of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (designatory letters CPA).

Up to 2013, there were three nationally recognized accounting designations in Canada: Chartered Accountant (CA), Certified General Accountant (CGA), and Certified Management Accountants (CMA). The national CA and CGA bodies were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 and 1913 respectively, The national CMA organization was established under the Canada Corporations Act in 1920.

In January 2012, following eight months of member and stakeholder consultation, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), the Society of Management Accountants of Canada (CMA Canada) and Certified General Accountants of Canada (CGA-Canada) issued &quot;A Framework for Uniting the Canadian Accounting Profession&quot; under a new Canadian Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation. Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) was established by CICA and CMA Canada on January 1, 2013, under the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act, to support Canadian provincial accounting bodies that were unifying under the CPA banner. CGA-Canada integrated with CPA Canada on October 1, 2014, completing the unification of Canada&#x27;s accounting profession at the national level.

All recognized national and provincial accounting bodies in Canada have now unified under the CPA banner. The Canadian CPA designation is held by more than 200,000 members in Canada and around the world.

==Japan==
In Japan, a certified public accountant must be a member of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (JICPA). It is the sole professional accountancy organization in Japan.

==India==
Chartered accountancy is offered in India by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), the second largest accounting body in the world. This Institute was established in 1949 under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 for the regulation of the profession of chartered accountants in India.

The ICAI set up the Accountancy Museum of India in 2009, the third museum of accounting in the world. It is located at ICAI&#x27;s office in Noida.A Cost and Management Accountant is registered as a member under the Institute of Cost Accountants of India(ICMAI) previously known as (ICWAI) which is a statutory body constituted under the Cost and Works Accountants Act 1959 enacted by the Parliament of India, it is also the second largest Management Accountancy body in the world. The members of the Institute are widely recognized as Cost and Management Accountants (FCMA, ACMA).

==Indonesia==
Under Public Accountants Law ( UU 5/2011), the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Indonesia (IAPI) is the professional organization having the authority to issue CPA designation which is the statutory requirements for obtaining public accountant license from the government.

==Pakistan==

<doc id="58219" wikidata="Q3370592" url="?curid=58219" title="Baby farming">
<text>Baby farming is the historical practice of accepting custody of an infant or child in exchange for payment in late-Victorian Britain and, less commonly, in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. If the infant was young, this usually included wet-nursing (breast-feeding by a woman not the mother). Some baby farmers &quot;adopted&quot; children for lump-sum payments, while others cared for infants for periodic payments.

==Description==

The use of foster care in 18th-century Britain by middle-class parents was described by Claire Tomalin in her biography of Jane Austen, who was fostered in the 1760s in this manner, as were all her siblings, from when they were a few months old until they were toddlers. Tomalin emphasizes the emotional distance this created.

Important historical context for the practice is the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which denied the poor the right to subsistence. In particular, single mothers were then forced to work in prison-like workhouses.
In late-Victorian Britain (and, less commonly, in Australia and the United States), baby farming was the practice of accepting custody of an infant or child in exchange for payment. Though baby farmers were paid in the understanding that care would be provided, the term &quot;baby farmer&quot; was used as an insult, and improper treatment was usually implied. Illegitimacy and its attendant social stigma were usually the impetus for a mother&#x27;s decision to put her children &quot;out to nurse&quot; with a baby farmer, but baby farming also encompassed foster care and adoption in the period before they were regulated by British law in the mid 19th century. Wealthier women would also put their infants out to be cared for in the homes of villagers.

Particularly in the case of lump-sum adoptions, it was more profitable for the baby farmer if the infant or child she adopted died, since the small payment could not cover the care of the child for long. Some baby farmers adopted numerous children and then neglected them or murdered them outright (see infanticide). Several baby farmers were tried for murder, manslaughter, or criminal neglect and were hanged. Margaret Waters (executed 1870) and Amelia Dyer (executed 1896) were two infamous British baby farmers, as were Amelia Sach and Annie Walters (executed 1903). The last baby farmer to be executed in Britain was Rhoda Willis, who was hanged in Wales in 1907.

The only woman to be executed in New Zealand, Minnie Dean, was a baby farmer, although in 1926, a male baby farmer, Daniel Cooper, was executed for the death of his pregnant first wife and two subsequent infants. In Australia, baby-farmer Frances Knorr was executed for infanticide in 1894. Although John and Sarah Makin were also convicted of infanticide, only John Makin had been executed a year earlier (1893) in Sydney for this crime.

In Scandinavia there was a euphemism for this activity: &quot;änglamakerska&quot; (Swedish, including Hilda Nilsson) and &quot;englemagerske&quot; (Danish, including Dagmar Overby), both literally meaning a &quot;(female) angel maker&quot;.

==Decline==
An undercover investigation of baby-farming, reported in 1870 in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, concluded that &quot;My conviction is that children are murdered in scores by these women, that adoption is only a fine phrase for slow or sudden death&quot;.

Spurred by a series of articles that appeared in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1867, the Parliament of the United Kingdom began to regulate baby farming in 1872 with the passage of the Infant Life Protection Act 1872.

London coroner Athelstan Braxton Hicks gave evidence in 1896 on the dangers of baby-farming to the Select Committee on Infant Life Protection Bill. One case that he cited was that of Mrs. Arnold, who had been &quot;sweating&quot; infants legally by doing so one at a time. At another inquest, the jury were of the &quot;opinion that there has been gross neglect in the case&quot; but were unable to allocate responsibility. They added the rider that &quot;The jury are strongly of opinion that further legislation in what are usually known as baby farming cases is greatly needed, and particularly that the required legislation should extend to the care of one infant only, and that the age of the infant should not be limited to one year, but rather to five years and that it should be an offence for any person undertaking the care of such infant to sub farm it.&quot;

The Infant Life Protection Act 1897 finally empowered local authorities to control the registration of nurses responsible for more than one infant under the age of five for a period longer than 48 hours. 

A series of acts passed over the next seventy years, including the Children Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 67), under which &quot;no infant could be kept in a home that was so unfit and so overcrowded as to endanger its health, and no infant could be kept by an unfit nurse who threatened, by neglect or abuse, its proper care and maintenance.&quot;

The Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act 1939 gradually placed adoption and foster care under the protection and regulation of the state.

== Postwar Britain ==
In the 1960s and 70s, thousands of West African children were privately fostered by white families in the UK in a phenomenon known as &#x27;farming&#x27;. The biological parents were usually students in the UK who also had a job. They placed ads in the newspapers looking for foster families to care for their children.

<text>The United States Secret Service (USSS or Secret Service) is a federal law enforcement agency under the Department of Homeland Security tasked with conducting criminal investigations and providing protection to U.S. political leaders, their families, and visiting heads of state or government. The Secret Service was, until 2003, part of the Department of the Treasury, due to their initial mandate of combating counterfeiting of U.S. currency. The agency has protected U.S. presidents and presidential candidates since 1901.

==Primary missions==
The Secret Service is mandated by Congress with two distinct and critical national security missions: protecting the nation&#x27;s leaders and safeguarding the financial and critical infrastructure of the United States.

===Protective mission===
The Secret Service is tasked with ensuring the safety of the president of the United States, the vice president of the United States, the president-elect of the United States, the vice president-elect of the United States, and their immediate families; former presidents, their spouses and their children under the age of 16; those in the presidential line of succession, major presidential and vice-presidential candidates and their spouses; and visiting foreign heads of state and heads of government. By custom, it also provides protection to the secretary of the treasury and secretary of homeland security, as well as other people as directed by the president (usually the White House chief of staff and national security advisor, among others). Former Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle told the congressional oversight committee that as of July 22, 2024 the secret service has a total of 36 protectees. By federal statute, the President and Vice President may not refuse this protection. The Secret Service also provides physical security for the White House Complex; the neighboring Treasury Department building; the vice president&#x27;s residence; the principal private residences of the president, vice president and former presidents; and all foreign diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C. The protective mission includes protective operations to coordinate manpower and logistics with state and local law enforcement in the US, protective advances to conduct site and venue assessments for protectees, and protective intelligence to investigate all manners of threats made against protectees. The Secret Service is the lead agency in charge of the planning, coordination, and implementation of security operations for events designated as National Special Security Events (NSSE). As part of the service&#x27;s mission of preventing an incident before it occurs, the agency relies on advance work and threat assessments developed by its Intelligence Division to identify potential risks to protectees.

===Investigative mission===
The Secret Service is tasked with safeguarding the payment and financial systems of the United States from a wide range of financial and cyber-based crimes. Financial investigations include counterfeit U.S. currency, bank and financial institution fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, illicit financing operations, and major conspiracies. Cyber investigations include cybercrime, network intrusions, identity theft, access device fraud, credit card fraud, and intellectual property crimes. The Secret Service is also a member of the FBI&#x27;s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) which investigates and combats terrorism on a national and international scale. Also, the Secret Service investigates missing and exploited children and is a partner of the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC).

The Secret Service&#x27;s initial responsibility was to investigate the counterfeiting of U.S. currency, which was rampant following the American Civil War. The agency then evolved into the United States&#x27; first domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Many of the agency&#x27;s missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), and IRS Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI).

The Secret Service is also tasked with investigating reports of the existence of specimens of the extremely rare 1933 double eagle gold coin, as only a single example of the fourteen known survivors from this mintage year is authorized to be owned or sold.

===Dual objective===

The Secret Service combines the two responsibilities into a dual objective. The two core missions of protection and investigation synergize with each other, providing benefits to special agents during the course of their careers. Skills developed during the course of investigations which are also used in an agent&#x27;s protective duties include but are not limited to: 
* Partnerships that are created between field offices and local law enforcement during the course of investigations being used to gather both protective intelligence and in coordinating protection events.
* Tactical operation (e.g. surveillance, arrests, and search warrants) and law enforcement writing (e.g. affidavits, after-action reports, and operations plans) skills being applied to both investigative and protective duties.
* Proficiency in analyzing handwriting and forgery techniques being applied in protective investigations of handwritten letters and suspicious-package threats.
* Expertise in investigating electronic and financial crimes being applied in protective investigations of threats made against the nation&#x27;s leaders on the Internet.

Protection of the nation&#x27;s highest elected leaders and other government officials is one of the primary missions of the Secret Service. After the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley, Congress also directed the Secret Service to protect the president of the United States. The Secret Service investigates thousands of incidents each year of individuals threatening the president of the United States.

The Secret Service is authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 3056(a) to protect:
* The president, vice president (or the next individual in the order of succession, should the vice presidency be vacant), president-elect and vice president-elect
* The immediate families of the above individuals
* Former presidents and their spouses for their lifetimes, except if the spouse remarries
* Children of former presidents under the age of 16
* Visiting heads of state or government and their spouses traveling with them
* Other distinguished foreign visitors to the United States and official representatives of the United States performing special missions abroad, when the president directs protection be provided
* Major presidential and vice presidential candidates and, within 120 days of a general presidential election, their spouses
*Former vice presidents, their spouses, and their children under 16 years of age, for up to 6 months from the date the former vice president leaves office (the Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize temporary protection of these individuals at any time after that period)

In addition to the above, the Secret Service can also protect other individuals by executive order of the president. Under Presidential Policy Directive 22, &quot;National Special Security Events&quot;, the Secret Service is the lead agency for the design and implementation of operational security plans for events designated an NSSE by the secretary of homeland security.

There have been changes to the protection of former presidents over time. Under the original Former Presidents Act, former presidents and their spouses were entitled to lifetime protection, subject to limited exceptions. In 1994, this was amended to reduce the protection period to 10 years after a former president left office, starting with presidents assuming the role after January 1, 1997. On January 10, 2013, President Barack Obama signed legislation reversing this limit and reinstating lifetime protection to all former presidents. This change impacted Presidents Obama and G.W. Bush, as well as all future presidents.

Protection of government officials is not solely the responsibility of the Secret Service, with many other agencies, such as the United States Capitol Police, Supreme Court Police and Diplomatic Security Service, providing personal protective services to domestic and foreign officials. However, while these agencies are nominally responsible for services to other officers of the United States and senior dignitaries, the Secret Service provides protective services at the highest-level – i.e. for heads of state and heads of government.

The Secret Service&#x27;s other primary mission is investigative; to protect the payment and financial systems of the United States from a wide range of financial and electronic-based crimes including counterfeit U.S. currency, bank and financial institution fraud, illicit financing operations, cybercrime, identity theft, intellectual property crimes, and any other violations that may affect the United States economy and financial systems. The agency&#x27;s key focus is on large, high-dollar economic impact cases involving organized criminal groups. Financial criminals include embezzling bank employees, armed robbers at automatic teller machines, heroin traffickers, and criminal organizations that commit bank fraud on a global scale.

The USSS plays a leading role in facilitating relationships between other law enforcement entities, the private sector, and academia. The service maintains the Electronic Crimes Task Forces, which focus on identifying and locating international cyber criminals connected to cyber intrusions, bank fraud, data breaches, and other computer-related crimes. Additionally, the Secret Service runs the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI), which provides law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges with cyber training and information to combat cybercrime.

In the face of budget pressure, hiring challenges and some high-profile lapses in its protective service role in 2014, the Brookings Institution and some members of Congress are asking whether the agency&#x27;s focus should shift more to the protective mission, leaving more of its original mission to other agencies.

==History==
===Early years===
Following the Civil War, counterfeiting of U.S. currency was a problem. Abraham Lincoln established a commission to make recommendations to remedy the problem. According to writer Joshua D Glawson, the day that Abraham Lincoln signed the approval of starting the Secret Service, Lincoln was shot. The Secret Service was later established on July 5, 1865, in Washington, D.C., Chief William P. Wood was sworn in by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. It was commissioned in Washington, D.C. as the &quot;Secret Service Division&quot; of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the U.S. Post Office Department&#x27;s Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (originally created by the first Postmaster General Benjamin Franklin in 1772 as the position of Surveyor and becoming an agency in 1830, now known as the United States Postal Inspection Service since 1954), United States Customs Service (formed July 31, 1789), the United States Marshals Service (formed September 24, 1789) and the United States Park Police (originally formed in 1791 as the Park Watchman by George Washington &amp; becoming the Park Police on December 14, 1919). In 1867 Secret Service responsibilities were broadened to include &quot;detecting persons perpetrating frauds against the government&quot; with them investigating the Ku Klux Klan, illegal distillers, smugglers, mail theft and land fraud. In 1870 Secret Service headquarters was moved to New York City but was returned to Washington D.C. four years later in 1874, where it remains to this day.

===20th century===
After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection. In 1902, William Craig became the first Secret Service agent to die while on duty, in a road accident while riding in the presidential carriage.

The Secret Service was the first U.S. domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Domestic intelligence collection and counterintelligence responsibilities were later vested in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

====Taft Mexican Summit (1909)====
In 1909, President William H. Taft agreed to meet with Mexican president Porfirio Díaz in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. The historic summit resulted in serious assassination threats and other security concerns for the nascent Secret Service, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, BOI agents, U.S. Marshals, and an additional 250-man private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, were all called in by Chief John Wilkie to provide added security. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. The man was captured and disarmed only a few feet from Díaz and Taft.

==== 1920s ====

The first unofficial female special agent was Florence Bolan. She joined the service in 1917. In 1924, Bolan was promoted to operative (the title preceding special agent) where she performed duties, such as searching female prisoners and engaging in occasional fieldwork.

====1940s====
The Secret Service assisted in arresting Japanese American leaders and in the Japanese American internment during World War II.

====1950s====
In 1950, President Harry S. Truman was residing in Blair House while the White House, across the street, was undergoing renovations. On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, approached Blair House with the intent to assassinate President Truman. Collazo and Torresola opened fire on Private Leslie Coffelt and other White House Police officers. Though mortally wounded by three shots from a 9 mm German Luger to his chest and abdomen, Private Coffelt returned fire, killing Torresola with a single shot to his head. Collazo was also shot, but survived his injuries and served 29 years in prison before returning to Puerto Rico in late 1979. Coffelt is the only member of the Secret Service killed while protecting a US president against an assassination attempt (Special Agent Tim McCarthy stepped in front of President Ronald Reagan during the assassination attempt of March 30, 1981, and took a bullet to the chest but made a full recovery).

====1960s====
In 1968, as a result of Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Congress authorized protection of major presidential and vice presidential candidates and nominees. In 1965 and 1968, Congress also authorized lifetime protection of the spouses of deceased presidents unless they remarry and of the children of former presidents until age 16.

====1970s====
In 1970, Phyllis Shantz became the first female officer sworn into the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, then called the Executive Protective Service. In 1971, the first five official female Special Agents were sworn in - Laurie Anderson, Sue Baker, Kathryn Clark, Holly Hufschmidt, and Phyllis Shantz.

====1980s====

In 1984, the US Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which extended the Secret Service&#x27;s jurisdiction over credit card fraud and computer fraud.

====1990s====
In 1990, the Secret Service initiated Operation Sundevil, which they originally intended as a sting against malicious hackers, allegedly responsible for disrupting telephone services across the entire United States. The operation, which was later described by Bruce Sterling in his book &quot;The Hacker Crackdown&quot;, affected a great number of people unrelated to hacking, and led to no convictions. The Secret Service, however, was sued and required to pay damages. On March 1, 1990, the Secret Service served a search warrant on Steve Jackson Games, a small company in Austin, Texas, seizing three computers and over 300 floppy disks. In the subsequent lawsuit, the judge reprimanded the Secret Service, calling their warrant preparation &quot;sloppy.&quot;

In 1994 and 1995, it ran an undercover sting called Operation Cybersnare. The Secret Service has concurrent jurisdiction with the FBI over certain violations of federal computer crime laws. They have created 24 Electronic Crimes Task Forces (ECTFs) across the United States. These task forces are partnerships between the service, federal/state and local law enforcement, the private sector and academia aimed at combating technology-based crimes.

In 1998, President Bill Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 62, which established National Special Security Events (NSSE). That directive made the Secret Service responsible for security at designated events. In 1999, the United States Secret Service Memorial Building was dedicated in DC, granting the agency its first headquarters. Prior to this, the agency&#x27;s different departments were based in office space around the DC area. The General Services Administration acquired the United States Secret Service Memorial Building&#x27;s adjoining property, the Webster School, for the Secret Service.

===21st century===
===2000s===
==== September 11 attacks ====
The New York City Field office was located at 7 World Trade Center. Immediately after the World Trade Center was attacked as part of the September 11 attacks, Special Agents and other New York Field office employees were among the first to respond with first aid. Sixty-seven Special Agents in New York City, at and near the New York Field Office, helped to set up triage areas and evacuate the towers. One Secret Service employee, Master Special Officer Craig Miller, died during the rescue efforts. On August 20, 2002, Director Brian L. Stafford awarded the Director&#x27;s Valor Award to employees who assisted in the rescue attempts.

==== Domestic expansion ====
Effective March 1, 2003, the Secret Service transferred from the Treasury to the newly established Department of Homeland Security.

The USA Patriot Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001, mandated the Secret Service to establish a nationwide network of ECTFs in addition to the one already active in New York. As such, this mandate expanded on the agency&#x27;s first ECTF—the New York Electronic Crimes Task Force, formed in 1995—which brought together federal, state and local law enforcement, prosecutors, private-industry companies, and academia. These bodies collectively provide necessary support and resources to field investigations that meet any one of the following criteria: significant economic or community impact; participation of organized criminal groups involving multiple districts or transnational organizations; or use of schemes involving new technology.

The network prioritizes investigations that meet the following criteria:
* Significant economic or community impact,
* Participation of multiple-district or transnational organized criminal groups,
* Use of new technology as a means to commit crime.

Investigations conducted by ECTFs include crimes such as computer generated counterfeit currency; bank fraud; virus and worm proliferation; access device fraud; telecommunications fraud; Internet threats; computer system intrusions and cyberattacks; phishing/spoofing; assistance with Internet-related child pornography and exploitation; and identity theft.

==== International expansion ====

On July 6, 2009, the U.S. Secret Service expanded its fight on cybercrime by creating the first European Electronic Crime Task Force, based on the successful U.S. domestic model, through a memorandum of understanding with Italian police and postal officials. Over a year later, on August 9, 2010, the agency expanded its European involvement by creating its second overseas ECTF in the United Kingdom.

Both task forces are said to concentrate on a wide range of &quot;computer-based criminal activity,&quot; including:
* Identity theft
* Network intrusions
* Other computer-related crimes affecting financial and other critical infrastructures.

====2010s====
In September 2014, the United States Secret Service came under criticism following two high-profile incidents involving intruders at the White House. One such intruder entered the East Room of the White House through an unlocked door.

====2020s====
On April 15, 2020, the ICE Homeland Security Investigations unit launched &quot;Operation Stolen Promise&quot; that targets COVID-19 related fraud. The operation conscripted resources from various branches of law enforcement and the government, including the U.S. Secret Service. About $2 trillion in the relief package known as the CARES Act were earmarked by law in March 2020, bringing unemployment benefits and loans to millions of Americans. However, as Secret Service spokesmen subsequently pointed out, the Act also opened up opportunities for criminals to fraudulently apply for aid. By the end of 2021, nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secret Service had seized more than $1.2 billion in relief funds appropriated by fraudsters.

On June 1, 2020, during a peaceful protest outside Lafayette Square, the U.S. Secret Service acted contrary to an operational plan and began advancing seven minutes before U.S. Park Police gave any dispersal warnings. This early deployment increased tensions between law enforcement and the protesters. They faced resistance and used pepper spray in response to eggs and bottles being thrown. Attorney General William Barr spoke with the U.S. Park Police operational commander seven minutes before the Secret Service began advancing, and again later, before President Trump visited a nearby Parish House to pose for a photo while holding a Bible. The U.S. Secret Service later apologized but Joseph Cuffari, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General, prevented career officials from investigating the role U.S. Secret Service played in the Trump administration’s controversial use of force to remove protesters that day.

In August 2020, a Secret Service officer shot a man once in the chest at the corner of 17th Street and Pennsylvania during one of then-President Trump’s press conferences. The president was evacuated but returned later and told the White House press corps that the man had a gun. However, according to court documents, the man was actually holding a comb, told the officers he was armed and took a shooting stance before being shot. The man is schizophrenic and was charged with simple assault of a law enforcement officer.

A day before the January 6 United States Capitol attack in 2021, the Secret Service warned Capitol Police of threats of violence that Capitol Police officers could face violence at the hands of supporters of President Donald Trump. On January 6, Secret Service agents provided security in and around the United States Capitol, as well as evacuating Vice President Mike Pence during the riot. Testimony in Congress indicates Pence was concerned his security detail would remove him from the Capitol, stopping him from completing his duty to oversee the final count of electoral college votes. At the center of the controversy surrounding the Secret Service and January 6 investigations is Anthony M. Ornato, who had been the head of Trump&#x27;s security detail, but took the unprecedented step of leaving the Secret Service to become deputy White House chief of staff and becoming a &quot;key part of Trump’s effort to get reelected.&quot;

The Secret Service assisted in the seizure of hacker forum RaidForums in 2022.

In April 2022, four Secret Service agents, one of whom was assigned to First Lady Jill Biden, were placed on leave after accepting lavish gifts, rent free apartments, and other bribes from two men ultimately convicted of impersonating federal officers.

On August 24, 2022, President Joe Biden named Kimberly Cheatle, the senior director of global security at PepsiCo, as the agency&#x27;s new director. Cheatle was in the Secret Service for 27 years and became the first woman to serve as assistant director of protective operations, a department tasked with protecting the president and dignitaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viser_8/24/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2023, a Secret Service agent guarding Naomi Biden fired shots at three people seen breaking into an unoccupied government vehicle in Georgetown.

On July 13, 2024, Secret Service agents protecting former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in advance of his presumptive Republican candidacy in the 2024 United States presidential election, shot and killed Thomas Matthew Crooks during an assassination attempt on Trump. Crooks, armed with an AR-15–style rifle, had shot at Trump from an elevated position near the venue. Trump was injured in his right ear and quickly rushed to hospital, while Crooks was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. One other attendee, 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, was also killed by Crooks and several others in attendance were injured. 
On July 23, 2024, Kimberly Cheatle resigned from her position as the director of the Secret Service just one day after she testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability about the assassination attempt and acknowledged it was &quot;the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades&quot;.

==Attacks on presidents==

Since the 1960s, presidents John F. Kennedy (killed), Gerald Ford (twice attacked, but uninjured) and Ronald Reagan (seriously wounded) have been attacked while appearing in public. Agents on scene, though not injured, during attacks on presidents include William Greer and Roy Kellerman. One of the agents was Robert DeProspero, the Special Agent In Charge (SAIC) of Reagan&#x27;s Presidential Protective Division (PPD) from January 1982 to April 1985. DeProspero was deputy to Jerry Parr, the SAIC of PPD during the Reagan assassination attempt on March 30, 1981.
The Kennedy assassination spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, an agent protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was riding in the car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leaped from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped onto the back of the president&#x27;s moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the president and the first lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.

Rufus Youngblood was riding in the vice-presidential car. When the shots were fired, he vaulted over the front seat and threw his body over Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. That evening, Johnson called Secret Service Chief James J. Rowley and cited Youngblood&#x27;s bravery. Youngblood would later recall some of this in his memoir, &quot;Twenty Years in the Secret Service&quot;.

The period following the Kennedy assassination was the most difficult in the modern history of the agency. Press reports indicated that morale among the agents was &quot;low&quot; for months following the assassination. The agency overhauled its procedures in the wake of the Kennedy killing. Training, which until that time had been confined largely to &quot;on-the-job&quot; efforts, was systematized and regularized.

The Reagan assassination attempt also involved several Secret Service agents, particularly agent Tim McCarthy, who spread his stance to protect Reagan as six bullets were being fired by the would-be assassin, John Hinckley Jr. McCarthy survived a .22-caliber round in the abdomen. For his bravery, McCarthy received the NCAA Award of Valor in 1982. Jerry Parr, the agent who pushed President Reagan into the limousine, and made the critical decision to divert the presidential motorcade to George Washington University Hospital instead of returning to the White House, was also honored with U.S. Congress commendations for his actions that day.

==Significant investigations==
One significant Secret Service investigation was the arrest and indictment of Max Ray Butler, co-founder of the Carders Market carding website. Butler was indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after his September 5, 2007 arrest, on wire fraud and identity theft charges. According to the indictment, Butler hacked into computers at financial institutions and credit card processing centers over the Internet and sold the tens of thousands of credit card numbers that he acquired in the process.

===Operation Firewall===

In October 2004, 28 suspects—located across eight U.S. states and six countries—were arrested on charges of identity theft, computer fraud, credit-card fraud, and conspiracy. Nearly 30 national and foreign field offices of the U.S. Secret Service, including the newly established national ECTFs, and countless local enforcement agencies from around the globe, were involved in this operation. Collectively, the arrested suspects trafficked in at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, which amounted to $4.3 million of losses to financial institutions. However, authorities estimated that prevented loss to the industry was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The operation, which started in July 2003 and lasted for more than a year, led investigators to identify three cybercriminal groups: Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits.

From the investigation, there was the arrest and indictment of Albert Gonzalez and 11 other individuals: three U.S. citizens, one from Estonia, three from Ukraine, two from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, one from Belarus, and one known only by an online alias. They were arrested on August 5, 2008, for the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers from major U.S. retailers, including TJX Companies, BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes &amp; Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21, and DSW. Gonzalez, the main organizer of the scheme, was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy for his leading role in the crime.

==Personnel==

As of 2010, the service had over 6,500 employees: 3,200 Special Agents, 1,300 Uniformed Division Officers, and 2,000 technical and administrative employees. Special agents serve on protective details and investigate financial, cyber, and homeland security-related crimes.
===Special Agent===

The Secret Service&#x27;s most familiar personnel are the plain-clothes investigators and personal protectors, who form almost half their total number. This special agent position is highly selective, with for example in 2011, the service accepting less than 1% of its 15,600 special agent applicants.

At a minimum, a prospective agent must be a U.S. citizen, possess a current valid driver&#x27;s license, be in excellent health and physical condition, possess visual acuity no worse than 20/100 uncorrected or correctable to 20/20 in each eye, and be between age 21–37 at the time of appointment, but eligible veterans may apply past age 37. In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the &quot;Isabella v. Department of State&quot; court decision: OPM Letter.

Prospective agents must also qualify for a TS/SCI (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information) clearance, and undergo an extensive background investigation, to include in-depth interviews, drug screening, medical diagnosis, and full-scope polygraph examination.
Special agents receive training in two locations, totaling approximately 31 weeks. The first phase, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) is conducted at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia, lasting approximately 13 weeks. The second phase, the Special Agent Training Course (SATC) is conducted at the Secret Service Academy, James J. Rowley Training Center (JJRTC), just outside Washington, D.C. in Laurel, Maryland, lasting approximately 18 weeks.
A typical special agent career path, depending upon performance and promotions that affect individual assignments, begins with the first six to eight years on the job assigned to a field office. Applicants are directed to list their office location preference during the application process, and upon receiving a final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from. After their field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective assignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency&#x27;s international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency&#x27;s foreign law enforcement counterparts.

Special agents are hired at the GL-07, GL-09, or GS-11 grade level, depending on individual qualifications and/or education. Agents are eligible for promotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to GS-13. The full performance grade level for a journeyman field agent is GS-13, which a GL-07, GL-09, or GS-11 agent may reach in as little as four, three, or two years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible for competitive promotion to supervisory positions, which encompasses the GS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. Higher ranks continue to use variations on the &quot;Special Agent&quot; title, as with several other Federal agencies with a plainclothes or investigatory role. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as rank-and-file field agents, will continue to advance the GS-13 step level, capping at GS-13 Step 10.

Special agents also receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of premium overtime pay which provides them with an additional 25% bonus pay on top of their salary, as agents are required to work an average workweek of 50 hours as opposed to 40. As of 2025, an agent living in the Washington, DC area (DC, VA, MD) will earn an annual salary of $80,985 (GL-07), $90,317 (GL-09), $105,751 (GS-11), $126,751 (GS-12), $150,723 (GS-13), $178,110 (GS-14), and $195,200 (GS-15). Journeyman field agents at GS-13 Step 10 are also paid a salary of $195,200.

Due to the nature of their work, Secret Service agents are regularly eligible for overtime pay in addition to LEAP, and are compensated up to $225,700 per year (Level II of the Executive Schedule).

===Uniformed Division Officer===

The Secret Service Uniformed Division is a security police similar to the U.S. Capitol Police or DHS Federal Protective Service, with &quot;police&quot; rather than &quot;agent&quot;-style ranks. It is in charge of protecting the physical White House grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C. area. Established in 1922 as the White House Police, this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force&#x27;s responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.

Secret Service Uniformed Division officers provide protection for the White House Complex, the vice president&#x27;s residence, the main Treasury Building and Annex, and foreign diplomatic missions and embassies in the Washington, D.C., area. Additionally, Uniformed Division officers travel in support of presidential, vice presidential and foreign head of state government missions. Officers may, as their careers progress, be selected to participate in one of several specialized units, including the:
* Canine Unit: Performing security sweeps and responding to bomb threats and suspicious packages.
* Emergency Response Team: Providing a coordinated tactical response for the White House and other protected facilities.
* Counter-sniper Team: Utilizing observation, sighting equipment and high-performance weapons to provide a secure environment for protectees.
* Motorcade Support Unit: Providing motorcycle tactical support for official movements of motorcades.
* Crime Scene Search Unit: Photographing, collecting and processing physical and latent evidence.
* Office of Training: Serving as firearms and classroom instructors or recruiters.
* Special Operations Section: Handling special duties and functions at the White House Complex, including conducting the daily congressional and public tours of the White House.

==Weapons and equipment==

Since the agency&#x27;s inception, a variety of weapons have been carried by its agents.

As a non-lethal option, Special Agents, Special Officers, and Uniformed Division Officers are armed with the ASP 16&quot; expandable baton, and Uniformed Division officers also carry pepper spray.

===Weapons===


===Badges===
===Attire===

Special agents and special officers of the Secret Service wear attire that is appropriate for their surroundings, in order to blend in as much as possible. In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but it can range from a tuxedo to casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically, Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication earpiece. Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.

The attire for Uniformed Division Officers includes standard police uniforms or utility uniforms and ballistic/identification vests for members of the counter-sniper team, Emergency Response Team (ERT), and canine officers. The shoulder patch of the Uniformed Division consists of the U.S. coat of arms on white or black, depending on the garment. Also, the shoulder patch is embroidered with &quot;U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division Police&quot; around the emblem.

===Vehicles===
When transporting the president in a motorcade, the Secret Service uses a fleet of custom-built armored Cadillac Limousines, the newest and largest version of which is known as &quot;The Beast&quot;. Armored Chevrolet Suburbans are also used when logistics require such a vehicle or when a more low-profile appearance is required. For official movement, the limousine is affixed with U.S. and presidential flags and the presidential seal on the rear doors. For unofficial events, the vehicles are left sterile and unadorned.

Government audits have criticized the Secret Service for a &quot;slow embrace of technology&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Field offices==
The Secret Service has agents assigned to 136 field offices and field agencies, and the headquarters in Washington, D.C. The service&#x27;s offices are located in cities throughout the United States and the world. The offices in Lyon (France) and The Hague (Netherlands) are respectively responsible for liaison with the headquarters of Interpol and Europol, located in those cities.

==Misconduct==

On April 14, 2012, the U.S. Secret Service placed 11 agents on administrative leave as the agency investigated allegations that the men brought prostitutes to their hotel rooms in Cartagena, Colombia, while on assignment to protect President Obama and that a dispute ensued with one of the women over payment the following morning.

After the incident was publicized, the Secret Service implemented new rules for its personnel. The rules prohibit personnel from visiting &quot;non-reputable establishments&quot; and from consuming alcohol less than ten hours before starting work. Additionally, they restrict who is allowed in hotel rooms.

In 2015, two inebriated senior Secret Service agents drove an official car into the White House complex and collided with a barrier. Chairperson of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that investigated the incident was Jason Chaffetz. Chaffetz, whose committee oversees the Secret Service, never disclosed that he had applied for and was rejected from the agency in the 2000s.

In September 2015, it was revealed that 18 Secret Service employees or supervisors, including Assistant Director Ed Lowery, accessed an unsuccessful 2003 application by Chaffetz for employment with the agency and discussed leaking the information to the media in retaliation for Chaffetz&#x27; investigations of agency misconduct. The confidential personal information was later leaked to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. Agency Director Joe Clancy apologized to Chaffetz and said that disciplinary action would be taken against those responsible.

In March 2017, a member of Vice President Mike Pence&#x27;s detail was suspended after the agent was caught visiting a prostitute at a hotel in Maryland.

In July 2022, during President Biden&#x27;s trip to the Middle East, a Secret Service agent was sent back to the United States from Israel after indiscriminately assaulting a woman who was walking in the street, next to a bar in Machane Yehuda. A Secret Service spokesman said in a statement that the agency was informed of the encounter, and the agent, who was working in Israel, was &quot;briefly detained and questioned by Israeli police, who released him without charges.&quot;

On July 15, 2022, &quot;The Intercept&quot; reported that a letter from the Department of Homeland Security revealed the Secret Service had erased text messages from the day before and day of the January 6 insurrection, shortly after those messages were requested by oversight officials investigating the agency’s response to the US Capitol riots. The agency claimed that the messages “were erased as part of a device-replacement program,” although the agency is bound by regulation to preserve all records of its activity (including text messages, emails, and other electronic communications). According to &quot;Politico&quot; on July 19, 2022, as new material becomes available to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, &quot;a potential second round of hearings gets slated for the fall [of 2022]&quot;. Such related new materials may include further details regarding “the potential unauthorized deletion” of text messages, particularly those from around January 5 and 6, 2021, by the Secret Service, then headed by Director James M. Murray, an appointee by then-President Trump in 2019. The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general has initiated a criminal investigation into the erasure of text messages exchanged by Secret Service agents relating to the January 6 Capitol breach.

Despite its connections to the Furukawa zaibatsu, Fujitsu escaped the Allied occupation of Japan after the Second World War mostly unscathed.
In 1954, Fujitsu manufactured Japan&#x27;s first computer, the FACOM 100 mainframe, and in 1961 launched its second generation computers (transistorized) the FACOM 222 mainframe. The 1968 FACOM230 &quot;5&quot; Series marked the beginning of its third generation computers. Fujitsu offered mainframe computers from 1955 until at least 2002 Fujitsu&#x27;s computer products have also included minicomputers, small business computers, servers and personal computers (FM-8, FM-7, FM-Towns, etc.).

In 1955, Fujitsu founded Kawasaki Frontale as a company football club; Kawasaki Frontale has been a J. League football club since 1999.

As part of the transaction, AMD contributed its flash memory group, Fab 25 in Texas, its R&amp;D facilities and assembly plants in Thailand, Malaysia and China; Fujitsu provided its Flash memory business division and the Malaysian Fujitsu Microelectronics final assembly and test operations.

From February 1989 until mid-1997, Fujitsu built the FM Towns PC variant. It started as a proprietary PC variant intended for multimedia applications and computer games, but later became more compatible with regular PCs. In 1993, the FM Towns Marty was released, a gaming console compatible with the FM Towns games.

==Horizon scandal==

Fujitsu designed, developed and operated the Horizon IT system which was at the centre of the legal dispute between the UK Post Office and its sub-postmasters. The case, still unsettled, found that the IT system was unreliable and that faults in the system caused discrepancies in branch accounts which were not the responsibility of the postmasters themselves. Mr Justice Fraser, the judge hearing the case, noted that Fujitsu had given &quot;wholly unsatisfactory evidence&quot; and there had been a &quot;lack of accuracy on the part of Fujitsu witnesses in their evidence&quot;. Following his concerns, Fraser sent a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Fujitsu was also found to have pressured the UK government to sign off the controversial and faulty IT system that, as a result of its faulty operation, resulted in numerous UK postmasters and sub-postmasters being accused falsely, and subsequently convicted of theft, false accounting and fraud, with consequences including imprisonment and monetary reparations. Of the hundreds of people affected, as of January 2024 only around 1 in 9 of those convicted have had their convictions overturned, whereas others have died due to the length of time that has elapsed, or have taken their own lives in the wake of their wrongful convictions. Although there has been some media coverage of organised legal appeals by groups of those affected, the matter has recently gained enhanced attention by mainstream media and the wider public as a whole, and is currently being acted upon by authorities in an attempt to accelerate and automate the clearing of the names of all those wrongly convicted, who until now were required to launch their own legal appeals in order to have their names cleared.

==Environmental record==
Fujitsu reports that all its notebook and tablet PCs released globally comply with the latest Energy Star standard.
Greenpeace&#x27;s Cool IT Leaderboard of April 2013 &quot;examines how IT companies use their considerable influence to change government policies that will drive clean energy deployment&quot; and ranks Fujitsu 4th out of 21 leading manufacturers, on the strength of &quot;developed case study data of its solutions with fairly transparent methodology, and is the leading company in terms of establishing ambitious and detailed goals for future carbon savings from its IT solutions.&quot;

<text>The Babylonian captivity or Babylonian exile was the period in Jewish history during which a large number of Judeans from the ancient Kingdom of Judah were forcibly relocated to Babylonia by the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The deportations occurred in multiple waves: After the siege of Jerusalem in 597 BCE, around 7,000 individuals were deported to Mesopotamia. Further deportations followed the destruction of Jerusalem and Solomon&#x27;s Temple in 587 BCE.

In the biblical account, after the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem, which resulted in tribute being paid by the Judean king Jehoiakim. In the fourth year of Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s reign, Jehoiakim refused to pay further tribute, which led to another siege of the city in Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s seventh year (598/597 BCE) that culminated in the death of Jehoiakim and the exile to Babylonia of his successor Jeconiah, his court, and many others; Jeconiah&#x27;s successor Zedekiah and others were exiled when Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed Jerusalem in his 18th year (587 BCE), and a later deportation occurred in Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s 23rd year (582 BCE). However, the dates, numbers of deportations, and numbers of deportees vary in the several biblical accounts.

The Bible recounts how after the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire to the Achaemenid Empire at the Battle of Opis in 539 BCE, exiled Judeans were permitted by the Persians to return to Judah. According to the biblical Book of Ezra, construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem began in the new Persian province of Yehud Medinata. All of these events are considered significant to the developed history and culture of the Jewish people, and ultimately had a far-reaching impact on the development of Judaism.

Archaeological studies have revealed that, although the city of Jerusalem was utterly destroyed, other parts of Judah continued to be inhabited during the period of the exile. Historical records from Mesopotamia and Jewish sources indicate that a significant portion of the Jewish population chose to remain in Mesopotamia. This decision led to the establishment of a sizable Jewish community in Mesopotamia known as the &quot;golah&quot; (dispersal), which persisted until modern times. The Iraqi Jewish, Persian Jewish, Georgian Jewish, Bukharian Jewish, and the Mountain Jewish communities are believed to derive their ancestry in large part from these exiles; these communities have now largely emigrated to Israel.

==Biblical accounts of the exile==

In the late 7th century BCE, the Kingdom of Judah was a client state of the Assyrian empire. In the last decades of the century, Assyria was overthrown by Babylon, an Assyrian province. Egypt, fearing the sudden rise of the Neo-Babylonian empire, seized control of Assyrian territory up to the Euphrates river in Syria, but Babylon counter-attacked. In the process Josiah, the king of Judah, was killed in a battle with the Egyptians at the Battle of Megiddo (609 BCE).

After the defeat of Pharaoh Necho&#x27;s army by the Babylonians at Carchemish in 605 BCE, Jehoiakim began paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. Some of the young nobility of Judah were taken to Babylon.

In the following years, the court of Jerusalem was divided into two parties, one supporting Egypt, the other Babylon. After Nebuchadnezzar was defeated in battle in 601 BCE by Egypt, Judah revolted against Babylon, culminating in a three-month siege of Jerusalem beginning in late 598 BCE. Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, died during the siege and was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin (also called Jeconiah) at the age of eighteen. The city fell on 2 Adar (March 16) 597 BCE, and Nebuchadnezzar pillaged Jerusalem and its Temple and took Jeconiah, his court and other prominent citizens (including the prophet Ezekiel) back to Babylon. Jehoiakim&#x27;s uncle Zedekiah was appointed king in his place, but the exiles in Babylon continued to consider Jeconiah as their Exilarch, or rightful ruler.

Despite warnings by Jeremiah and others of the pro-Babylonian party, Zedekiah revolted against Babylon and entered into an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra. Nebuchadnezzar returned, defeated the Egyptians, and again besieged Jerusalem, resulting in the city&#x27;s destruction in 587 BCE. Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the city wall and the Temple, together with the houses of the most important citizens. Zedekiah and his sons were captured and the sons were executed in front of Zedekiah, who was then blinded and taken to Babylon with many others (Jer 52:10–11). Judah became a Babylonian province, called Yehud, putting an end to the independent Kingdom of Judah (Because of the missing years in the Jewish calendar, rabbinic sources place the date of the destruction of the First Temple at 3338 AM (423 BCE) or 3358 AM (403 BCE)).

The first governor appointed by Babylon was Gedaliah, a native Judahite; he encouraged the many Jews who had fled to surrounding countries such as Moab, Ammon and Edom to return, and he took steps to return the country to prosperity. Some time later, a surviving member of the royal family assassinated Gedaliah and his Babylonian advisors, prompting many refugees to seek safety in Egypt. By the end of the second decade of the 6th century BCE, in addition to those who remained in Judah, there were significant Jewish communities in Babylon and in Egypt; this was the beginning of the later numerous Jewish communities living permanently outside Judah in the Jewish Diaspora.

According to the book of Ezra, the Persian Cyrus the Great ended the exile in 538 BCE, the year after he captured Babylon. The exile ended with the return under Zerubbabel the Prince (so-called because he was a descendant of the royal line of David) and Joshua the Priest (a descendant of the line of the former High Priests of the Temple) and their construction of the Second Temple in the period from 521 to 516 BCE.

==Archaeological and other extra-biblical evidence==
===First campaign (597 BCE)===
Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s siege of Jerusalem, his capture of its king, his appointment of another in his place, and the plundering of the city in 597 BCE are corroborated by a passage in the Babylonian Chronicles:In the seventh year, in the month of Kislev, the king of Akkad mustered his troops, marched to the Hatti-land, and encamped against the City of Judah and on the ninth day of the month of Adar he seized the city and captured the king. He appointed there a king of his own choice and taking heavy tribute brought it back to Babylon.

Jehoiachin&#x27;s Rations Tablets, describing ration orders for a captive King of Judah, identified with King Jeconiah, have been discovered during excavations in Babylon, in the royal archives of Nebuchadnezzar. One of the tablets refers to food rations for &quot;Ya’u-kīnu, king of the land of Yahudu&quot; and five royal princes, his sons.

===Second campaign (589–587 BCE)===
Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian forces returned in 589 BCE and rampaged through Judah, leaving clear archaeological evidence of destruction in many towns and settlements there. Clay ostraca from this period, referred to as the Lachish letters, were discovered during excavations; one, which was probably written to the commander at Lachish from an outlying base, describes how the signal fires from nearby towns were disappearing: &quot;And may (my lord) be apprised that we are watching for the fire signals of Lachish according to all the signs which my lord has given, because we cannot see Azeqah.&quot; Archaeological finds from Jerusalem testify that virtually the whole city within the walls was burnt to rubble in 587 BCE and utterly destroyed.

===Aftermath in Judah===
Archaeological excavations and surveys have enabled the population of Judah before the Babylonian destruction to be estimated to have been approximately 75,000. Taking the different biblical numbers of exiles at their highest, 20,000, this would mean that perhaps 25% of the population had been deported to Babylon, with the remaining majority staying in Judah. Although Jerusalem was destroyed, with large parts of the city remaining in ruins for 150 years, numerous other settlements in Judah continued to be inhabited, with no signs of disruption visible in archaeological studies.

Archaeologist Avraham Faust suggests that between the deportations and executions caused by the Babylonians, plus the famines and epidemics that occurred during the war, the population of Judah may have been reduced to as little as 10% of what it had been in the time before deportations.

===Conditions in exile===
In Mesopotamia, the exiled Judeans were relocated to agricultural settlements, with one notable settlement being Tel-Abib near the city of Nippur. Biblical scholar Niels Peter Lemche suggests that the exiled Judeans experienced a lifestyle scarcely less prosperous than what they were accustomed to in their homeland.

However, there is evidence for hardship. For example, exiled Jewish leaders were suspected of national disloyalty and were reduced to peasantry, where they worked in agriculture and building projects and performed simple tasks such as farming, shepherding and fishing. This ended when the Persians conquered Babylon. Exiled Jewish commoners were nostalgic about Judah and, due to circumstance, were forced to abandon temple-based worship. They mostly worshipped in private homes and kept some religious traditions such as circumcision, Sabbath observance, reading of the Psalms and Law.

===Persian restoration===
The Cyrus Cylinder, an ancient tablet on which is written a declaration in the name of Cyrus referring to restoration of temples and repatriation of exiled peoples, has often been taken as corroboration of the authenticity of the biblical decrees attributed to Cyrus, but other scholars point out that the cylinder&#x27;s text is specific to Babylon and Mesopotamia and makes no mention of Judah or Jerusalem. Professor Lester L. Grabbe asserted that the &quot;alleged decree of Cyrus&quot; regarding Judah, &quot;cannot be considered authentic&quot;, but that there was a &quot;general policy of allowing deportees to return and to re-establish cult sites&quot;. He also stated that archaeology suggests that the return was a &quot;trickle&quot; taking place over decades, rather than a single event.

As part of the Persian Empire, the former Kingdom of Judah became the province of Judah (&quot;Yehud Medinata&quot;) with different borders, covering a smaller territory. The population of the province was greatly reduced from that of the kingdom; archaeological surveys suggesting a population of around 30,000 people in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE.

A 2017 exhibition in Jerusalem displayed over 100 cuneiform tablets detailing trade in fruits and other commodities, taxes, debts, and credits accumulated between Jews forced or persuaded to move from Jerusalem by King Nebuchadnezzar around 600 BCE. The tablets included details on one exiled Judean family over four generations, all with Hebrew names.

Most Jews who returned were poor Jews and either saw the exile as &quot;spiritual regeneration&quot; or &quot;divine punishment for sins&quot;. One reason why wealthy Jews stayed in Mesopotamia includes economic opportunities, which were relatively uncommon in Judah.

==Exilic literature==
The exilic period was a rich source for Hebrew literature. Biblical depictions of the exile include Book of Jeremiah 39–43 (which saw the exile as a lost opportunity); the final section of 2 Kings (which portrays it as the temporary end of history); 2 Chronicles (in which the exile is the &quot;Sabbath of the land&quot;); and the opening chapters of Ezra, which records its end. Other works from or about the exile include the stories in Daniel 1–6, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, the &quot;Story of the Three Youths&quot; (1 Esdras 3:1–5:6), and the books of Tobit and Judith. The Book of Lamentations arose from the Babylonian captivity. The final redaction of the Pentateuch took place in the Persian period following the exile,and the Priestly source, one of its main sources, is primarily a product of the post-exilic period when the former Kingdom of Judah had become the Persian province of Yehud.

==Significance for Jewish culture==
In the Hebrew Bible, the captivity in Babylon is presented as a punishment for idolatry and disobedience to Yahweh. The Babylonian captivity had a number of serious effects on Judaism and Jewish culture. For example, the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, which eventually evolved into the Hebrew alphabet, was adopted during this period. Eventually the Aramaic-based Hebrew alphabet replaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet.

This period saw the last high point of biblical prophecy in the person of Ezekiel, followed by the emergence of the central role of the Torah in Jewish life. According to many historical-critical scholars, the Torah was redacted during this time, and began to be regarded as the authoritative text for Jews. This period saw their transformation into an ethno-religious group who could survive without a central Temple. Israeli philosopher and Biblical scholar Yehezkel Kaufmann said &quot;The exile is the watershed. With the exile, the religion of Israel comes to an end and Judaism begins.&quot;

Notably, the period also saw the theological transition of the ancient Israelite religion among the captives from a monolatrous to a monotheistic faith system.

This process coincided with the emergence of scribes and sages as Jewish leaders (see Ezra). Prior to exile, the people of Israel had been organized according to tribe. Afterwards, they were organized by smaller family groups. Only the Tribe of Levi continued in its temple role after the return. After this time, there were always sizable numbers of Jews living outside the Land of Israel; thus, it also marks the beginning of the &quot;Jewish diaspora&quot;, unless this is considered to have begun with the Assyrian captivity.

In Rabbinic literature, Babylon was one of a number of metaphors for the Jewish diaspora. Most frequently the term &quot;Babylon&quot; meant the diaspora prior to the destruction of the Second Temple. The post-destruction term for the Jewish Diaspora was &quot;Rome&quot;, or &quot;Edom&quot;.
