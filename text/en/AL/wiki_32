<text>Ra&#x27;anana () is an affluent city in the southern Sharon Plain of the Central District of Israel. It was founded in 1922 as an American-Jewish settlement, 1 km south of the village of Tabsur, where an important World War I battle had taken place four years previously.

Bordered by Kfar Saba and Hod HaSharon on the east and Herzliya on the southwest, it had a population of in . While the majority of its residents are Israeli-born Jews, a large part of the population consists of Jewish immigrants from the Americas, Europe and South Africa.

Ra&#x27;anana&#x27;s industrial park is home to global and local start-up companies. It was designated a &quot;Green City&quot; by the World Health Organization in 2005.

==History==

Before the 20th century, the location of Ra&#x27;anana formed part of the Forest of Sharon, a hallmark of the region&#x27;s historical landscape. It was an open woodland dominated by Mount Tabor Oak (Quercus ithaburensis), which extended from Kfar Yona in the north to Ra’anana in the south. The local Arab inhabitants traditionally used the area for pasture, firewood and intermittent cultivation. The intensification of settlement and agriculture in the coastal plain during the 19th century led to deforestation and subsequent environmental degradation known from Hebrew sources.

In 1912, the Company for Jewish Settlement in Israel formed the &quot;Ahuza A – New York&quot; group to purchase land in Palestine for agricultural settlement. World War I delayed their plans, but in 1921, it was decided to establish a settlement. On April 2, 1922, two wagons left the corner of Lilienblum and Herzl Streets in Tel Aviv carrying four &quot;Ahuza&quot; members, three laborers and two armed watchmen. After a five-hour journey, they unloaded their baggage at the place destined to become Ra&#x27;anana.

In its early days, the settlement was called &quot;Ahuza A – New York.&quot; The Arabs of the region called it &quot;Little America&quot; as most of its residents were English speakers and came from New York. Later it was renamed &quot;Ra&#x27;anania&quot; and finally the founding settlers chose &quot;Ra&#x27;anana&quot; as its official name.

The settlement was built along a main street, Ahuza Street, and six other streets, three to the north of Ahuza Street and three to the south. Between 1925 and 1927, the Community House, which would house a variety of public institutions, including the secretariat, clinic, synagogue, meeting place for local committee meetings, assembly hall, culture room, school, kindergarten, and post office, was built. According to a census conducted in 1931 by the British Mandate authorities, Ra&#x27;anana had a population of 615 inhabitants in 182 houses.

In 1936, it was given local council status. By 1948, the year of Israel&#x27;s formation, Ra&#x27;anana was a town of 3,000 residents. In April of that year, the Israeli military depopulated the nearby Palestinian Arab village of Tabsur. The city expanded over its ruins. This had grown to 5,900 in 1949.
By the late 1960s, Raanana had a population of 8,500 spanning an area of .

===Ra’anana car-ramming attack===
The Ra’anana car-ramming attack was an attack against civilians in Israel that occurred on 15 January 2024 in Ra&#x27;anana. The police arrested two Palestinian men from Bani Na&#x27;im in connection with carrying out the attack.

The attack began when one of the perpetrators stabbed a woman and took possession of her car. They then began ramming pedestrians with the vehicle, eventually losing control and crashing. The perpetrators took control of another vehicle and continued the attack until finally being stopped.

One individual was killed and 17 injured.

==Demographics==

Ra&#x27;anana&#x27;s population consists mainly of native-born Israelis, but about 22% of the city&#x27;s residents are immigrants to Israel (Ra&#x27;anana is ranked second in immigrant absorption in Israel, after Netanya). It is home to a large number of immigrants from English-speaking countries, a significant number of immigrants from Latin America, mainly Argentina, and also absorbed large numbers of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. In recent years the number of French immigrants is also on the rise. 

Though the majority of Ra&#x27;anana residents are secular, there is a sizeable religious community, mainly consisting of Modern Orthodox Jews, many of whom are immigrants from the US, UK, South Africa and France. The religious community generally lives on the north side and the secular community on the southern side. There are nearly 100 synagogues in Ra&#x27;anana, ranging from small minyanim to large edifices, and including a wide range of traditions, including Reform, Sefaradi, Ashkenazi, Yemenite, Afghani and Libyan synagogues. Many of these synagogues cater to specific immigrant groups. There is also a small Hasidic community of Clevelander Hasidim, led by the Clevelander Rebbe of Ra&#x27;anana, Rabbi Yitzchok Rosenbaum. The orthodox chief rabbi of the city is Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz.

The program, created in conjunction with &quot;Ness Technologies&quot;, uses advanced technology as a catalyst for developing skills.

Ra&#x27;anana has developed supplementary education programs for the afternoon and evening hours, which meet the needs of thousands of children, aged 5–18. These programs foster creativity, promote social involvement and cultivate leadership skills. The supplementary education projects include over 20 &quot;Batei Talmid&quot; citywide extracurricular programs, an afternoon daycare program, and music, dance, art and science centers.

<text>A discrete cosine transform (DCT) expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. The DCT, first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, is a widely used transformation technique in signal processing and data compression. It is used in most digital media, including digital images (such as JPEG and HEIF), digital video (such as MPEG and ), digital audio (such as Dolby Digital, MP3 and AAC), digital television (such as SDTV, HDTV and VOD), digital radio (such as AAC+ and DAB+), and speech coding (such as AAC-LD, Siren and Opus). DCTs are also important to numerous other applications in science and engineering, such as digital signal processing, telecommunication devices, reducing network bandwidth usage, and spectral methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.

A DCT is a Fourier-related transform similar to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), but using only real numbers. The DCTs are generally related to Fourier series coefficients of a periodically and symmetrically extended sequence whereas DFTs are related to Fourier series coefficients of only periodically extended sequences. DCTs are equivalent to DFTs of roughly twice the length, operating on real data with even symmetry (since the Fourier transform of a real and even function is real and even), whereas in some variants the input or output data are shifted by half a sample.

There are eight standard DCT variants, of which four are common.
The most common variant of discrete cosine transform is the type-II DCT, which is often called simply &quot;the DCT&quot;. This was the original DCT as first proposed by Ahmed. Its inverse, the type-III DCT, is correspondingly often called simply &quot;the inverse DCT&quot; or &quot;the IDCT&quot;. Two related transforms are the discrete sine transform (DST), which is equivalent to a DFT of real and odd functions, and the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), which is based on a DCT of overlapping data. Multidimensional DCTs (MD DCTs) are developed to extend the concept of DCT to multidimensional signals. A variety of fast algorithms have been developed to reduce the computational complexity of implementing DCT. One of these is the integer DCT (IntDCT), an integer approximation of the standard DCT, used in several ISO/IEC and ITU-T international standards.

DCT compression, also known as block compression, compresses data in sets of discrete DCT blocks. DCT blocks sizes including 8x8 pixels for the standard DCT, and varied integer DCT sizes between 4x4 and 32x32 pixels. The DCT has a strong &quot;energy compaction&quot; property, capable of achieving high quality at high data compression ratios. However, blocky compression artifacts can appear when heavy DCT compression is applied.

== History ==
The DCT was first conceived by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao while working at Kansas State University. The concept was proposed to the National Science Foundation in 1972. The DCT was originally intended for image compression. Ahmed developed a practical DCT algorithm with his PhD students T. Raj Natarajan, Wills Dietrich, and Jeremy Fries, and his friend Dr. K. R. Rao at the University of Texas at Arlington in 1973. They presented their results in a January 1974 paper, titled &quot;Discrete Cosine Transform&quot;. It described what is now called the type-II DCT (DCT-II), as well as the type-III inverse DCT (IDCT).

Since its introduction in 1974, there has been significant research on the DCT. In 1977, Wen-Hsiung Chen published a paper with C. Harrison Smith and Stanley C. Fralick presenting a fast DCT algorithm. Further developments include a 1978 paper by M. J. Narasimha and A. M. Peterson, and a 1984 paper by B. G. Lee. These research papers, along with the original 1974 Ahmed paper and the 1977 Chen paper, were cited by the Joint Photographic Experts Group as the basis for JPEG&#x27;s lossy image compression algorithm in 1992.

The discrete sine transform (DST) was derived from the DCT, by replacing the Neumann condition at &quot;x=0&quot; with a Dirichlet condition. The DST was described in the 1974 DCT paper by Ahmed, Natarajan and Rao. A type-I DST (DST-I) was later described by Anil K. Jain in 1976, and a type-II DST (DST-II) was then described by H.B. Kekra and J.K. Solanka in 1978.

In 1975, John A. Roese and Guner S. Robinson adapted the DCT for inter-frame motion-compensated video coding. They experimented with the DCT and the fast Fourier transform (FFT), developing inter-frame hybrid coders for both, and found that the DCT is the most efficient due to its reduced complexity, capable of compressing image data down to 0.25-bit per pixel for a videotelephone scene with image quality comparable to an intra-frame coder requiring 2-bit per pixel. In 1979, Anil K. Jain and Jaswant R. Jain further developed motion-compensated DCT video compression, also called block motion compensation. This led to Chen developing a practical video compression algorithm, called motion-compensated DCT or adaptive scene coding, in 1981. Motion-compensated DCT later became the standard coding technique for video compression from the late 1980s onwards.

A DCT variant, the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), was developed by John P. Princen, A.W. Johnson and Alan B. Bradley at the University of Surrey in 1987, following earlier work by Princen and Bradley in 1986. The MDCT is used in most modern audio compression formats, such as Dolby Digital (AC-3), MP3 (which uses a hybrid DCT-FFT algorithm), Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), and Vorbis (Ogg).

Nasir Ahmed also developed a lossless DCT algorithm with Giridhar Mandyam and Neeraj Magotra at the University of New Mexico in 1995. This allows the DCT technique to be used for lossless compression of images. It is a modification of the original DCT algorithm, and incorporates elements of inverse DCT and delta modulation. It is a more effective lossless compression algorithm than entropy coding. Lossless DCT is also known as LDCT.

==Applications==
The DCT is the most widely used transformation technique in signal processing, and by far the most widely used linear transform in data compression. Uncompressed digital media as well as lossless compression have high memory and bandwidth requirements, which is significantly reduced by the DCT lossy compression technique, capable of achieving data compression ratios from 8:1 to 14:1 for near-studio-quality, up to 100:1 for acceptable-quality content. DCT compression standards are used in digital media technologies, such as digital images, digital photos, digital video, streaming media, digital television, streaming television, video on demand (VOD), digital cinema, high-definition video (HD video), and high-definition television (HDTV).

The DCT, and in particular the DCT-II, is often used in signal and image processing, especially for lossy compression, because it has a strong &quot;energy compaction&quot; property. In typical applications, most of the signal information tends to be concentrated in a few low-frequency components of the DCT. For strongly correlated Markov processes, the DCT can approach the compaction efficiency of the Karhunen-Loève transform (which is optimal in the decorrelation sense). As explained below, this stems from the boundary conditions implicit in the cosine functions.

DCTs are widely employed in solving partial differential equations by spectral methods, where the different variants of the DCT correspond to slightly different even and odd boundary conditions at the two ends of the array.

DCTs are closely related to Chebyshev polynomials, and fast DCT algorithms (below) are used in Chebyshev approximation of arbitrary functions by series of Chebyshev polynomials, for example in Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature.

===General applications===
The DCT is widely used in many applications, which include the following.

===Visual media standards===
The DCT-II is an important image compression technique. It is used in image compression standards such as JPEG, and video compression standards such as , MJPEG, MPEG, DV, Theora and Daala. There, the two-dimensional DCT-II of formula_1 blocks are computed and the results are quantized and entropy coded. In this case, formula_2 is typically 8 and the DCT-II formula is applied to each row and column of the block. The result is an 8 × 8 transform coefficient array in which the formula_3 element (top-left) is the DC (zero-frequency) component and entries with increasing vertical and horizontal index values represent higher vertical and horizontal spatial frequencies.

The integer DCT, an integer approximation of the DCT, is used in Advanced Video Coding (AVC), introduced in 2003, and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), introduced in 2013. The integer DCT is also used in the High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF), which uses a subset of the HEVC video coding format for coding still images. AVC uses 4 x 4 and 8 x 8 blocks. HEVC and HEIF use varied block sizes between 4 x 4 and 32 x 32 pixels. , AVC is by far the most commonly used format for the recording, compression and distribution of video content, used by 91% of video developers, followed by HEVC which is used by 43% of developers.

===Multidimensional DCT===
Multidimensional DCTs (MD DCTs) have several applications, mainly 3-D DCTs such as the 3-D DCT-II, which has several new applications like Hyperspectral Imaging coding systems, variable temporal length 3-D DCT coding, video coding algorithms, adaptive video coding and 3-D Compression. Due to enhancement in the hardware, software and introduction of several fast algorithms, the necessity of using MD DCTs is rapidly increasing. DCT-IV has gained popularity for its applications in fast implementation of real-valued polyphase filtering banks, lapped orthogonal transform and cosine-modulated wavelet bases.

===Digital signal processing===
DCT plays an important role in digital signal processing specifically data compression. The DCT is widely implemented in digital signal processors (DSP), as well as digital signal processing software. Many companies have developed DSPs based on DCT technology. DCTs are widely used for applications such as encoding, decoding, video, audio, multiplexing, control signals, signaling, and analog-to-digital conversion. DCTs are also commonly used for high-definition television (HDTV) encoder/decoder chips.

===Compression artifacts===
A common issue with DCT compression in digital media are blocky compression artifacts, caused by DCT blocks. In a DCT algorithm, an image (or frame in an image sequence) is divided into square blocks which are processed independently from each other, then the DCT blocks is taken within each block and the resulting DCT coefficients are quantized. This process can cause blocking artifacts, primarily at high data compression ratios. This can also cause the mosquito noise effect, commonly found in digital video.

DCT blocks are often used in glitch art. The artist Rosa Menkman makes use of DCT-based compression artifacts in her glitch art, particularly the DCT blocks found in most digital media formats such as JPEG digital images and MP3 audio. Another example is &quot;Jpegs&quot; by German photographer Thomas Ruff, which uses intentional JPEG artifacts as the basis of the picture&#x27;s style.

==Informal overview==

Like any Fourier-related transform, DCTs express a function or a signal in terms of a sum of sinusoids with different frequencies and amplitudes. Like the DFT, a DCT operates on a function at a finite number of discrete data points. The obvious distinction between a DCT and a DFT is that the former uses only cosine functions, while the latter uses both cosines and sines (in the form of complex exponentials). However, this visible difference is merely a consequence of a deeper distinction: a DCT implies different boundary conditions from the DFT or other related transforms.

The Fourier-related transforms that operate on a function over a finite domain, such as the DFT or DCT or a Fourier series, can be thought of as implicitly defining an &quot;extension&quot; of that function outside the domain. That is, once you write a function formula_4 as a sum of sinusoids, you can evaluate that sum at any formula_5, even for formula_5 where the original formula_4 was not specified. The DFT, like the Fourier series, implies a periodic extension of the original function. A DCT, like a cosine transform, implies an even extension of the original function.

However, because DCTs operate on &quot;finite&quot;, &quot;discrete&quot; sequences, two issues arise that do not apply for the continuous cosine transform. First, one has to specify whether the function is even or odd at &quot;both&quot; the left and right boundaries of the domain (i.e. the min-&quot;n&quot; and max-&quot;n&quot; boundaries in the definitions below, respectively). Second, one has to specify around &quot;what point&quot; the function is even or odd. In particular, consider a sequence &quot;abcd&quot; of four equally spaced data points, and say that we specify an even &quot;left&quot; boundary. There are two sensible possibilities: either the data are even about the sample &quot;a&quot;, in which case the even extension is &quot;dcbabcd&quot;, or the data are even about the point &quot;halfway&quot; between &quot;a&quot; and the previous point, in which case the even extension is &quot;dcbaabcd&quot; (&quot;a&quot; is repeated).

Each boundary can be either even or odd (2 choices per boundary) and can be symmetric about a data point or the point halfway between two data points (2 choices per boundary), for a total of 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16 possibilities. These choices lead to all the standard variations of DCTs and also discrete sine transforms (DSTs). Half of these possibilities, those where the &quot;left&quot; boundary is even, correspond to the 8 types of DCT; the other half are the 8 types of DST.

These different boundary conditions strongly affect the applications of the transform and lead to uniquely useful properties for the various DCT types. Most directly, when using Fourier-related transforms to solve partial differential equations by spectral methods, the boundary conditions are directly specified as a part of the problem being solved. Or, for the MDCT (based on the type-IV DCT), the boundary conditions are intimately involved in the MDCT&#x27;s critical property of time-domain aliasing cancellation. In a more subtle fashion, the boundary conditions are responsible for the &quot;energy compactification&quot; properties that make DCTs useful for image and audio compression, because the boundaries affect the rate of convergence of any Fourier-like series.

In particular, it is well known that any discontinuities in a function reduce the rate of convergence of the Fourier series so that more sinusoids are needed to represent the function with a given accuracy. The same principle governs the usefulness of the DFT and other transforms for signal compression; the smoother a function is, the fewer terms in its DFT or DCT are required to represent it accurately, and the more it can be compressed. However, the implicit periodicity of the DFT means that discontinuities usually occur at the boundaries: any random segment of a signal is unlikely to have the same value at both the left and right boundaries. In contrast, a DCT where &quot;both&quot; boundaries are even &quot;always&quot; yields a continuous extension at the boundaries (although the slope is generally discontinuous). This is why DCTs, and in particular DCTs of types I, II, V, and VI (the types that have two even boundaries) generally perform better for signal compression than DFTs and DSTs. In practice, a type-II DCT is usually preferred for such applications, in part for reasons of computational convenience.

== Formal definition ==
Formally, the discrete cosine transform is a linear, invertible function formula_8 (where formula_9 denotes the set of real numbers), or equivalently an invertible × square matrix. There are several variants of the DCT with slightly modified definitions. The real numbers formula_10 are transformed into the real numbers formula_11 according to one of the formulas:

=== DCT-I ===
:formula_12

Some authors further multiply the formula_13 and formula_14 terms by formula_15 and correspondingly multiply the formula_16 and formula_17 terms by formula_18 which, if one further multiplies by an overall scale factor of formula_19, makes the DCT-I matrix orthogonal but breaks the direct correspondence with a real-even DFT.

The DCT-I is exactly equivalent (up to an overall scale factor of 2), to a DFT of formula_20 real numbers with even symmetry. For example, a DCT-I of formula_21 real numbers formula_22 is exactly equivalent to a DFT of eight real numbers (even symmetry), divided by two. (In contrast, DCT types II-IV involve a half-sample shift in the equivalent DFT.)

Note, however, that the DCT-I is not defined for formula_23 less than 2, while all other DCT types are defined for any positive formula_24

Thus, the DCT-I corresponds to the boundary conditions: formula_25 is even around formula_26 and even around formula_27; similarly for formula_28

=== DCT-II ===
:formula_29

The DCT-II is probably the most commonly used form, and is often simply referred to as &quot;the DCT&quot;.

This transform is exactly equivalent (up to an overall scale factor of 2) to a DFT of formula_30 real inputs of even symmetry where the even-indexed elements are zero. That is, it is half of the DFT of the formula_30 inputs formula_32 where formula_33 formula_34 for formula_35 formula_36 and formula_37 for formula_38 DCT-II transformation is also possible using 2 signal followed by a multiplication by half shift. This is demonstrated by Makhoul.

Some authors further multiply the formula_16 term by formula_40 and multiply the rest of the matrix by an overall scale factor of formula_41 (see below for the corresponding change in DCT-III). This makes the DCT-II matrix orthogonal, but breaks the direct correspondence with a real-even DFT of half-shifted input. This is the normalization used by Matlab, for example, see. In many applications, such as JPEG, the scaling is arbitrary because scale factors can be combined with a subsequent computational step (e.g. the quantization step in JPEG), and a scaling can be chosen that allows the DCT to be computed with fewer multiplications.

The DCT-II implies the boundary conditions: formula_25 is even around formula_43 and even around formula_44 formula_45 is even around formula_46 and odd around formula_47

=== DCT-III ===
:formula_48

Because it is the inverse of DCT-II up to a scale factor (see below), this form is sometimes simply referred to as &quot;the inverse DCT&quot; (&quot;IDCT&quot;).

Some authors divide the formula_49 term by formula_50 instead of by 2 (resulting in an overall formula_51 term) and multiply the resulting matrix by an overall scale factor of formula_52 (see above for the corresponding change in DCT-II), so that the DCT-II and DCT-III are transposes of one another. This makes the DCT-III matrix orthogonal, but breaks the direct correspondence with a real-even DFT of half-shifted output.

The DCT-III implies the boundary conditions: formula_53 is even around formula_54 and odd around formula_55 formula_56 is even around formula_57 and even around formula_58

=== DCT-IV ===
:formula_59

The DCT-IV matrix becomes orthogonal (and thus, being clearly symmetric, its own inverse) if one further multiplies by an overall scale factor of formula_60

A variant of the DCT-IV, where data from different transforms are &quot;overlapped&quot;, is called the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT).

The DCT-IV implies the boundary conditions: formula_25 is even around formula_62 and odd around formula_63 similarly for formula_64

=== DCT V-VIII ===
DCTs of types I–IV treat both boundaries consistently regarding the point of symmetry: they are even/odd around either a data point for both boundaries or halfway between two data points for both boundaries. By contrast, DCTs of types V-VIII imply boundaries that are even/odd around a data point for one boundary and halfway between two data points for the other boundary.

In other words, DCT types I–IV are equivalent to real-even DFTs of even order (regardless of whether formula_23 is even or odd), since the corresponding DFT is of length formula_20 (for DCT-I) or formula_67 (for DCT-II &amp; III) or formula_68 (for DCT-IV). The four additional types of discrete cosine transform correspond essentially to real-even DFTs of logically odd order, which have factors of formula_69 in the denominators of the cosine arguments.

However, these variants seem to be rarely used in practice. One reason, perhaps, is that FFT algorithms for odd-length DFTs are generally more complicated than FFT algorithms for even-length DFTs (e.g. the simplest radix-2 algorithms are only for even lengths), and this increased intricacy carries over to the DCTs as described below.

(The trivial real-even array, a length-one DFT (odd length) of a single number  , corresponds to a DCT-V of length formula_70)

== Inverse transforms ==
Using the normalization conventions above, the inverse of DCT-I is DCT-I multiplied by 2/(&quot;N&quot; − 1). The inverse of DCT-IV is DCT-IV multiplied by 2/&quot;N&quot;. The inverse of DCT-II is DCT-III multiplied by 2/&quot;N&quot; and vice versa.

Like for the DFT, the normalization factor in front of these transform definitions is merely a convention and differs between treatments. For example, some authors multiply the transforms by formula_71 so that the inverse does not require any additional multiplicative factor. Combined with appropriate factors of (see above), this can be used to make the transform matrix orthogonal.

== Multidimensional DCTs ==

Multidimensional variants of the various DCT types follow straightforwardly from the one-dimensional definitions: they are simply a separable product (equivalently, a composition) of DCTs along each dimension.

=== M-D DCT-II ===

For example, a two-dimensional DCT-II of an image or a matrix is simply the one-dimensional DCT-II, from above, performed along the rows and then along the columns (or vice versa). That is, the 2D DCT-II is given by the formula (omitting normalization and other scale factors, as above):

:formula_72
:The inverse of a multi-dimensional DCT is just a separable product of the inverses of the corresponding one-dimensional DCTs (see above), e.g. the one-dimensional inverses applied along one dimension at a time in a row-column algorithm.

The &quot;3-D DCT-II&quot; is only the extension of &quot;2-D DCT-II&quot; in three dimensional space and mathematically can be calculated by the formula

:formula_73

The inverse of 3-D DCT-II is 3-D DCT-III and can be computed from the formula given by
:formula_74

Technically, computing a two-, three- (or -multi) dimensional DCT by sequences of one-dimensional DCTs along each dimension is known as a &quot;row-column&quot; algorithm. As with multidimensional FFT algorithms, however, there exist other methods to compute the same thing while performing the computations in a different order (i.e. interleaving/combining the algorithms for the different dimensions). Owing to the rapid growth in the applications based on the 3-D DCT, several fast algorithms are developed for the computation of 3-D DCT-II. Vector-Radix algorithms are applied for computing M-D DCT to reduce the computational complexity and to increase the computational speed. To compute 3-D DCT-II efficiently, a fast algorithm, Vector-Radix Decimation in Frequency (VR DIF) algorithm was developed.

====3-D DCT-II VR DIF====
In order to apply the VR DIF algorithm the input data is to be formulated and rearranged as follows. The transform size &quot;N × N × N&quot; is assumed to be 2.

:formula_75
:where formula_76

The figure to the adjacent shows the four stages that are involved in calculating 3-D DCT-II using VR DIF algorithm. The first stage is the 3-D reordering using the index mapping illustrated by the above equations. The second stage is the butterfly calculation. Each butterfly calculates eight points together as shown in the figure just below, where formula_77.

The original 3-D DCT-II now can be written as

:formula_78

where formula_79

If the even and the odd parts of formula_80 and formula_81 and are considered, the general formula for the calculation of the 3-D DCT-II can be expressed as 
:formula_82

where

: formula_83

: formula_84

: formula_85

: formula_86

: formula_87

===== Arithmetic complexity =====
The whole 3-D DCT calculation needs formula_88 stages, and each stage involves formula_89 butterflies. The whole 3-D DCT requires formula_90 butterflies to be computed. Each butterfly requires seven real multiplications (including trivial multiplications) and 24 real additions (including trivial additions). Therefore, the total number of real multiplications needed for this stage is formula_91 and the total number of real additions i.e. including the post-additions (recursive additions) which can be calculated directly after the butterfly stage or after the bit-reverse stage are given by formula_92

The conventional method to calculate MD-DCT-II is using a Row-Column-Frame (RCF) approach which is computationally complex and less productive on most advanced recent hardware platforms. The number of multiplications required to compute VR DIF Algorithm when compared to RCF algorithm are quite a few in number. The number of Multiplications and additions involved in RCF approach are given by formula_93 and formula_94 respectively. From Table 1, it can be seen that the total number

of multiplications associated with the 3-D DCT VR algorithm is less than that associated with the RCF approach by more than 40%. In addition, the RCF approach involves matrix transpose and more indexing and data swapping than the new VR algorithm. This makes the 3-D DCT VR algorithm more efficient and better suited for 3-D applications that involve the 3-D DCT-II such as video compression and other 3-D image processing applications.

The main consideration in choosing a fast algorithm is to avoid computational and structural complexities. As the technology of computers and DSPs advances, the execution time of arithmetic operations (multiplications and additions) is becoming very fast, and regular computational structure becomes the most important factor. Therefore, although the above proposed 3-D VR algorithm does not achieve the theoretical lower bound on the number of multiplications, it has a simpler computational structure as compared to other 3-D DCT algorithms. It can be implemented in place using a single butterfly and possesses the properties of the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm in 3-D. Hence, the 3-D VR presents a good choice for reducing arithmetic operations in the calculation of the 3-D DCT-II, while keeping the simple structure that characterize butterfly-style Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithms.
The image to the right shows a combination of horizontal and vertical frequencies for an formula_95 two-dimensional DCT. Each step from left to right and top to bottom is an increase in frequency by 1/2 cycle.
For example, moving right one from the top-left square yields a half-cycle increase in the horizontal frequency. Another move to the right yields two half-cycles. A move down yields two half-cycles horizontally and a half-cycle vertically. The source data is transformed to a linear combination of these 64 frequency squares.

=== MD-DCT-IV ===
The M-D DCT-IV is just an extension of 1-D DCT-IV on to  dimensional domain. The 2-D DCT-IV of a matrix or an image is given by

:formula_96

: for formula_97 and formula_98

We can compute the MD DCT-IV using the regular row-column method or we can use the polynomial transform method for the fast and efficient computation. The main idea of this algorithm is to use the Polynomial Transform to convert the multidimensional DCT into a series of 1-D DCTs directly. MD DCT-IV also has several applications in various fields.

== Computation ==
Although the direct application of these formulas would require formula_99 operations, it is possible to compute the same thing with only formula_100 complexity by factorizing the computation similarly to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). One can also compute DCTs via FFTs combined with formula_101 pre- and post-processing steps. In general, formula_102 methods to compute DCTs are known as fast cosine transform (FCT) algorithms.

The most efficient algorithms, in principle, are usually those that are specialized directly for the DCT, as opposed to using an ordinary FFT plus formula_103 extra operations (see below for an exception). However, even &quot;specialized&quot; DCT algorithms (including all of those that achieve the lowest known arithmetic counts, at least for power-of-two sizes) are typically closely related to FFT algorithms – since DCTs are essentially DFTs of real-even data, one can design a fast DCT algorithm by taking an FFT and eliminating the redundant operations due to this symmetry. This can even be done automatically . Algorithms based on the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm are most common, but any other FFT algorithm is also applicable. For example, the Winograd FFT algorithm leads to minimal-multiplication algorithms for the DFT, albeit generally at the cost of more additions, and a similar algorithm was proposed by for the DCT. Because the algorithms for DFTs, DCTs, and similar transforms are all so closely related, any improvement in algorithms for one transform will theoretically lead to immediate gains for the other transforms as well .

While DCT algorithms that employ an unmodified FFT often have some theoretical overhead compared to the best specialized DCT algorithms, the former also have a distinct advantage: Highly optimized FFT programs are widely available. Thus, in practice, it is often easier to obtain high performance for general lengths with FFT-based algorithms.
Specialized DCT algorithms, on the other hand, see widespread use for transforms of small, fixed sizes such as the DCT-II used in JPEG compression, or the small DCTs (or MDCTs) typically used in audio compression. (Reduced code size may also be a reason to use a specialized DCT for embedded-device applications.)

In fact, even the DCT algorithms using an ordinary FFT are sometimes equivalent to pruning the redundant operations from a larger FFT of real-symmetric data, and they can even be optimal from the perspective of arithmetic counts. For example, a type-II DCT is equivalent to a DFT of size formula_104 with real-even symmetry whose even-indexed elements are zero. One of the most common methods for computing this via an FFT (e.g. the method used in FFTPACK and FFTW) was described by and , and this method in hindsight can be seen as one step of a radix-4 decimation-in-time Cooley–Tukey algorithm applied to the &quot;logical&quot; real-even DFT corresponding to the DCT-II.
Because the even-indexed elements are zero, this radix-4 step is exactly the same as a split-radix step. If the subsequent size formula_105 real-data FFT is also performed by a real-data split-radix algorithm (as in ), then the resulting algorithm actually matches what was long the lowest published arithmetic count for the power-of-two DCT-II (formula_106 real-arithmetic operations).

A recent reduction in the operation count to formula_107 also uses a real-data FFT. So, there is nothing intrinsically bad about computing the DCT via an FFT from an arithmetic perspective – it is sometimes merely a question of whether the corresponding FFT algorithm is optimal. (As a practical matter, the function-call overhead in invoking a separate FFT routine might be significant for small formula_108 but this is an implementation rather than an algorithmic question since it can be solved by unrolling or inlining.)

==Example of IDCT==

Consider this 8x8 grayscale image of capital letter A.


Each basis function is multiplied by its coefficient and then this product is added to the final image.

<text>The Senufo people, also known as Siena, Senefo, Sene, Senoufo, and Syénambélé, are a West African ethnolinguistic group. They consist of diverse subgroups living in a region spanning the northern Ivory Coast, the southeastern Mali and the western Burkina Faso. One sub-group, the Nafana, is found in north-western Ghana.

The Senufo people are predominantly animists, with some who are Muslims. They are regionally famous for their handicrafts, many of which feature their cultural themes and religious beliefs.

==Demographics and languages==

In the 1980s, estimates placed the total ethnic group population of Senufo people somewhere between 1.5 and 2.7 million. A 2013 estimate places the total over 3 million, with majority of them living in Ivory Coast in places such as Katiola, and some 0.8 million in southeastern Mali. Their highest population densities are found in the land between the Black Volta river, Bagoe River and Bani River.

Their kinship organization is matrilineal. Typically, the Senufo people are studied in three large subgroups that have been relatively isolated. The northern Senufo are called &quot;Supide or Kenedougou&quot;, found near Odienne, and who helped found an important kingdom of West Africa and challenged Muslim missionaries and traders. The southern Senufo are the largest group, numbering over 2 million, who allowed Muslim traders to settle within their communities in the 18th century who actively proselytized, and about 20% of the southern Senufo are Muslims. The third group is very small and isolated from both northern and southern Senufo. Some sociologists such as the French scholar Holas mentions fifteen identifiable sub-groups of Senufo people, with thirty dialects and four castes scattered between them.

The term &quot;Senufo&quot; refers to a linguistic group comprising roughly thirty related dialects within the larger Gur language family. It belongs to the Gur-branch of the Niger-Congo language family, and consists of four distinct languages namely Palaka(also spelt Kpalaga), Djimini(also spelt Dyimini), and Senari in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Suppire( also spelt Supyire) in Mali, as well as Karaboro in Burkina Faso. Within each group, numerous subdivisions use their own names for the people and language; the name Senufo is of external origin. Palaka separated from the main Senufo stock well before the 14th century ad; at about that time, with the founding of the town of Kong as a Bambara trade-route station, the rest of the population began migrations to the south, west, and north, resulting in the present divisions.The Senufo speaking people range from 800,000 to one million and live in agricultural based communities predominately located in the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, West Africa, Africa.

Korhogo, an ancient town in northern Ivory Coast dating from the 13th century, is linked to the Senufo people. This separation of languages and sub-ethnic groups may be linked to the 14th-century migrations with its founding along with the Bambara trade-route.

==History==

The Senufo people emerged as a group sometime within the 15th or 16th century. They were a significant part of the 17th to 19th-century Kénédougou Kingdom (literally &quot;country of the plain&quot;) with the capital of Sikasso. This region saw many wars including the rule of Daoula Ba Traoré, a cruel despot who reigned between 1840 and 1877. The Islamisation of the Senufo people began during this historical period of the Kénédougou Kingdom, but it was the kings &amp; chiefs who converted, while the general Senufo population refused. Daoula Ba Traoré attempted to convert his kingdom to Islam, destroying many villages within the kingdom such as Guiembe and Nielle in 1875 because they resisted his views. The Kénédougou dynastic rulers attacked their neighbors as well, such as the Zarma people and they in turn counterattacked many times between 1883 and 1898.

The pre-colonial wars and violence led to their migration into Burkina Faso in regions that became towns such as Tiembara in Kiembara Department. The Kénédougou kingdom and the Traoré dynasty were dissolved in 1898 with the arrival of French colonial rule.

===Slavery===
The Senufo people were both victims of and perpetrators of slavery as they victimized other ethnic groups by enslavement. They themselves bought and sold slaves to Muslim merchants, Asante people and Baoulé people. As refugees from other West African ethnic groups escaped wars, states Paul Lovejoy, some of them moved into the Senufo lands, seized their lands and enslaved them.

The largest demand for slaves initially came from the markets of Sudan, and for a long time, slave trading was one an important economic activity across the Sahel and West Africa, states Martin Klein. Sikasso and Bobo-Dioulasso were important sources of slaves captured who were then moved to Timbuktu and Banamba on their way to the Sudanese and Mauritanian slave markets.

Those enslaved in Senufo lands worked the land, herds and served within the home. Their owner and his dependents also had the right to have sexual intercourse with female domestic slaves. The children of a female slave inherited her slave status.

==Society and culture==

The Senufo are predominantly an agricultural people cultivating corn, millet, yams, and peanut. Senufo villages consist of small mud-brick homes. In the rainy southern communities of Senufo, thatched roofs are common, while flat roofs are prevalent in dry desert-like north. The Senufo is a patriarchal extended family society, where arranged typically cousin marriage and polygyny has been fairly common, however, succession and property inheritance has been matrilineal.

As agriculturalists, they cultivate a wide variety of crops, including cotton and cash crops for the international market. As musicians, they are world renowned, playing a multitude of instruments from: wind instruments (Aerophones), stringed instruments (Chordaphones) and percussive instruments (Membranophones). Senufo communities use a caste system, each division known as a Katioula. In this system the farmers, known as Fo no, and the artisans at the opposite ends of the spectrum. The term artisan encompasses different individual castes within Senufo society including blacksmiths (Kule), carvers (Kpeene), brasscutters (Tyeli), potterers, and leather workers, whose lives revolve around the roles, responsibilities, and structures inhabited by the individual class. Training to become an artisan takes about seven or eight years; commencing with an apprenticeship where the trainees create objects not associated with the religion of the Senufo, then culminating with an initiation process where they obtain the ability to create ritual object.

Regionally, the Senufo are famous as musicians and superb carvers of wood sculpture, masks, and figurines. The Senufo people have specialized their art and handicraft work by subgroups, wherein the art is learnt within this group, passed from one generation to the next. The &quot;Kulubele&quot; specialize as woodcarvers, the &quot;Fonombele&quot; specialize in blacksmith and basketry work, the &quot;Kpeembele&quot; specialize in brass casting, the &quot;Djelebele&quot; are renowned for leatherwork, the &quot;Tchedumbele&quot; are masters of gunsmith work, while &quot;Numu&quot; specialize in smithing and weaving. Outside the artisan subgroups, the Senufo people have hunters, musicians, grave-diggers, diviners, and healers who are called the &quot;Fejembele&quot;. Among these various subgroups, the leatherworkers or &quot;Djelebele&quot; are the ones who have most adopted Islam, although those who convert retain many of their animist practices.

Traditionally, the Senufo people have been a socially stratified society, similar to many West African ethnic groups having castes. These endogamous divisions are locally called &quot;Katioula&quot;, and one of the strata in this division includes slaves and descendants of slaves. According to Dolores Richter, the caste systems in Africa found among Senufo people features &quot;hierarchical ranking including despised lower castes, occupational specificity, ritual complementarity, endogamy, hereditary membership, residential isolation, and the political superiority of farmers over artisan castes&quot;.

The Senufo people usually fall within four societies in their culture: Poro, Sandogo, Wambele, or Tyekpa. While all the societies fill particular roles in the governance and education of the Senufo people, the Poro and Sandogo. Spirituality and divination are divided between these two gender-imperative societies with women falling under the Sando or Sandogo society, and men falling under the Poro society with the exception of men who are members of those of the women because of their mother. These societies are the two that create the majority of commissioned Seunfo art.

Typically, the Senufo villages are independent of each other, and each has a male secret society called &quot;Poro&quot; with elaborate initiation rituals in a patch of forest they consider as sacred. The initiation rituals involve masks, figurines, and ritual equipment that the Senufo people carve and have perfected. The secrecy has helped the Senufo people to preserve their culture in the times of wars and political pressure. Senufo wear specially-crafted brass jewelry, such as those mimicking wildlife. &quot;&quot;The main function of Poro is to guarantee a good relationship between the living world and the ancestors. Nerejao is an ancestress who is recognized as the true head of the Poro society. Divination, which is governed by the Sandogo society, is also an important part of Senufo religion. Although Sandogo is usually considered a women&#x27;s society, men who are called to the profession and inherit through the matrilineal line are permitted to become diviners.&quot;&quot;
The &quot;Sandogo&quot; are women diviners among the Senufo people. They have their own rituals and secret order. In addition, the Senufo people have &quot;Wambele&quot; and &quot;Typka&quot;, who perform sorcery and rituals.

Within Senufo culture, the female form is held above all others in terms of beauty and aesthetics and caryatid figures are seen with various cultural connotations. This is tied into the worship of the spirit, &quot;Ancient Mother&quot;, or the spirit, &quot;mother&quot;, Maleeo, who is revered as the guiding entity by all Poro society initiates and members. The goddess Maleeo has a partner, the god Kolocolo, who is seen as the identifying deity of the Sandogo, who granted the people marriage and this particular type of lineage to allow communication from humanity and the spirit world. Caryatid figures are seen as representations of the role of women as spiritual mediators and the Sandogo use them in ceremonies as symbols of this bilateral celestial discourse. Likewise, in the case of the Poro, there are writings about caryatid figures being used in ceremonies where they are brought out to commemorate advancement in the age-grade cycle, as well as being used to raise funds by initiates of the society. Calved figures were used in a tyekpa funeral ceremony as dance sculpture, held upon the head of the dancers while the ceremony takes place.

The traditional Senufo religion is a type of animism. This Senufo belief includes ancestral and nature spirits, who may be contacted. They believe in a Supreme Being, who is viewed in a dual female-male: an Ancient Mother, &quot;Maleeo&quot; or &quot;Katieleo&quot;, and a male Creator God, &quot;Kolotyolo&quot; or &quot;Koulotiolo&quot;.

===Influence===
The art of Senufo people inspired twentieth-century European artists such as Pablo Picasso and Fernand Léger. The cubism and masks found in Senufo pieces were a significant influence for Pablo Picasso&#x27;s African period.

The term &quot;Senufo&quot; has become a category to art collectors and scholars, a symbolism for the artistic traditions of West Africa, starting with the early twentieth century. Old pieces of Senufo art are found in many leading museums of the world.

Cornélius Yao Azaglo August, a photographer, created a photographical journal of Senufo people from 1955 onward.

==== China ====
* Emperor Wu of Han sends the diplomat Zhang Qian west to form an alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu. Wu does this after learning from Xiongnu defectors that the Xiongnu had defeated and killed the king of the Yuezhi, had expelled the Yuezhi from their lands and were using their king&#x27;s skull as a wine goblet. The Yuezhi had subsequently migrated further west. 
* Soon after his departure for the west, Zhang Qian is detained by Junchen Chanyu of the Xiongnu. He would remain in Xiongnu custody for more than ten years and would be given a Xiongnu wife.
* Wei Zifu enters Emperor Wu&#x27;s palace as a concubine and becomes pregnant. Enraged, Liu Piao, the mother of the childless Empress Chen Jiao (wife of Emperor Wu), kidnaps Zifu&#x27;s brother Wei Qing, who is rescued by Gongsun Ao. Wu responds by advancing the careers of members of the Wei family.

==== Parthia ====
* The Scythians defeat the Parthians in a battle around Media.

==== China ====
* January: Emperor Wu of Han begins a policy of pressuring the client kings of the Han dynasty into dividing their kingdoms. Previously, only the eldest son would inherit a kingdom. However, in an edict, Wu permits the kings of Liang and Chengyang to divide the land of their states and distribute the land to their younger brothers. Wu grants these brothers titles and promises to do the same if other kings grant land to younger brothers and younger sons. This precedent pressures other kings to do likewise, and Wu places the younger brothers and younger sons under the jurisdiction of the imperial prefectures.
* Wei Qing defeats a Xiongnu army near Gaoque. He then invades the Ordos Plateau, defeats the Xiongnu and their Baiyang and Loufan allies in the battles of Puni and Fuli, and then defeats the main Xiongnu force. The conquered territory becomes Shuofang Commandery. Wu orders the foundation of Shuofang City, and the system of defenses that had been built by the Qin dynasty general Meng Tian are repaired.
* The Han rationalize the northern frontier, abandoning the remote region of Zaoyang to the Xiongnu.

<text>In mathematics, the Roman surface or Steiner surface is a self-intersecting mapping of the real projective plane into three-dimensional space, with an unusually high degree of symmetry. This mapping is not an immersion of the projective plane; however, the figure resulting from removing six singular points is one. Its name arises because it was discovered by Jakob Steiner when he was in Rome in 1844.

The simplest construction is as the image of a sphere centered at the origin under the map formula_1 This gives an implicit formula of

:formula_2

Also, taking a parametrization of the sphere in terms of longitude () and latitude (), gives parametric equations for the Roman surface as follows:
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
The origin is a triple point, and each of the -, -, and -planes are tangential to the surface there. The other places of self-intersection are double points, defining segments along each coordinate axis which terminate in six pinch points. The entire surface has tetrahedral symmetry. It is a particular type (called type 1) of Steiner surface, that is, a 3-dimensional linear projection of the Veronese surface.

==Derivation of implicit formula==
For simplicity we consider only the case &quot;r&quot; = 1. Given the sphere defined by the points (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) such that
:formula_6

we apply to these points the transformation &quot;T&quot; defined by formula_7 say.

But then we have
:formula_8

and so formula_9 as desired.

Conversely, suppose we are given (&quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot;) satisfying

(*) formula_10

We prove that there exists (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) such that

(**) formula_6

for which formula_12

with one exception: In case 3.b. below, we show this cannot be proved.

1. In the case where none of &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; is 0, we can set
:formula_13

(Note that (*) guarantees that either all three of U, V, W are positive, or else exactly two are negative. So these square roots are of positive numbers.)

It is easy to use (*) to confirm that (**) holds for &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; defined this way.

2. Suppose that &quot;W&quot; is 0. From (*) this implies formula_14

and hence at least one of &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot; must be 0 also. This shows that is it impossible for exactly one of &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; to be 0.

3. Suppose that exactly two of &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; are 0. Without loss of generality we assume

(***)formula_15

It follows that formula_16

(since formula_17 implies that formula_18 and hence formula_19 contradicting (***).)

a. In the subcase where
:formula_20

if we determine &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; by
:formula_21

and formula_22

this ensures that (*) holds. It is easy to verify that formula_23

and hence choosing the signs of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; appropriately will guarantee formula_24

Since also formula_25

this shows that this subcase leads to the desired converse.

b. In this remaining subcase of the case 3., we have formula_26

Since formula_27

it is easy to check that formula_28

and thus in this case, where formula_29

there is no (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) satisfying formula_30

Hence the solutions (&quot;U&quot;, 0, 0) of the equation (*) with formula_31

and likewise, (0, &quot;V&quot;, 0) with formula_32

and (0, 0, &quot;W&quot;) with formula_33

(each of which is a noncompact portion of a coordinate axis, in two pieces) do not correspond to any point on the Roman surface.

4. If (&quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot;) is the point (0, 0, 0), then if any two of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; are zero and the third one has absolute value 1, clearly formula_34 as desired.

This covers all possible cases.

==Derivation of parametric equations==
Let a sphere have radius &quot;r&quot;, longitude &quot;φ&quot;, and latitude &quot;θ&quot;. Then its parametric equations are
:formula_35
:formula_36
:formula_37
Then, applying transformation &quot;T&quot; to all the points on this sphere yields
:formula_38
:formula_39
:formula_40
which are the points on the Roman surface. Let &quot;φ&quot; range from 0 to 2π, and let &quot;θ&quot; range from 0 to &quot;π/2&quot;.

==Relation to the real projective plane==
The sphere, before being transformed, is not homeomorphic to the real projective plane, &quot;RP2&quot;. But the sphere centered at the origin has this property, that if point &quot;(x,y,z)&quot; belongs to the sphere, then so does the antipodal point &quot;(-x,-y,-z)&quot; and these two points are different: they lie on opposite sides of the center of the sphere.

The transformation &quot;T&quot; converts both of these antipodal points into the same point,
:formula_41
:formula_42

Since this is true of all points of S2, then it is clear that the Roman surface is a continuous image of a &quot;sphere modulo antipodes&quot;. Because some distinct pairs of antipodes are all taken to identical points in the Roman surface, it is not homeomorphic to &quot;RP2&quot;, but is instead a quotient of the real projective plane &quot;RP2 = S2 / (x~-x)&quot;. Furthermore, the map T (above) from S2 to this quotient has the special property that it is locally injective away from six pairs of antipodal points. Or from RP2 the resulting map making this an immersion of RP2 — minus six points — into 3-space.

==Structure of the Roman surface==
The Roman surface has four bulbous &quot;lobes&quot;, each one on a different corner of a tetrahedron.

A Roman surface can be constructed by splicing together three hyperbolic paraboloids and then smoothing out the edges as necessary so that it will fit a desired shape (e.g. parametrization).

Let there be these three hyperbolic paraboloids:
* &quot;x&quot; = &quot;yz&quot;,
* &quot;y&quot; = &quot;zx&quot;,
* &quot;z&quot; = &quot;xy&quot;.
These three hyperbolic paraboloids intersect externally along the six edges of a tetrahedron and internally along the three axes. The internal intersections are loci of double points. The three loci of double points: &quot;x&quot; = 0, &quot;y&quot; = 0, and &quot;z&quot; = 0, intersect at a triple point at the origin.

For example, given &quot;x&quot; = &quot;yz&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = &quot;zx&quot;, the second paraboloid is equivalent to &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;/&quot;z&quot;. Then
:formula_43
and either &quot;y&quot; = 0 or &quot;z&quot;2 = 1 so that &quot;z&quot; = ±1. Their two external intersections are
* &quot;x = y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; = 1;
* &quot;x&quot; = −&quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; = −1.
Likewise, the other external intersections are
* &quot;x&quot; = &quot;z&quot;, &quot;y&quot; = 1;
* &quot;x&quot; = −&quot;z&quot;, &quot;y&quot; = −1;
* &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot; = 1;
* &quot;y&quot; = −&quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot; = −1.

Let us see the pieces being put together. Join the paraboloids &quot;y&quot; = &quot;xz&quot; and &quot;x&quot; = &quot;yz&quot;. The result is shown in Figure 1.
The paraboloid &quot;y = x z&quot; is shown in blue and orange. The paraboloid &quot;x = y z&quot; is shown in cyan and purple. In the image the paraboloids are seen to intersect along the &quot;z = 0&quot; axis. If the paraboloids are extended, they should also be seen to intersect along the lines
* &quot;z&quot; = 1, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;;
* &quot;z&quot; = −1, &quot;y&quot; = −&quot;x&quot;.
The two paraboloids together look like a pair of orchids joined back-to-back.

Now run the third hyperbolic paraboloid, &quot;z&quot; = &quot;xy&quot;, through them. The result is shown in Figure 2.
On the west-southwest and east-northeast directions in Figure 2 there are a pair of openings. These openings are lobes and need to be closed up. When the openings are closed up, the result is the Roman surface shown in Figure 3.
A pair of lobes can be seen in the West and East directions of Figure 3. Another pair of lobes are hidden underneath the third (&quot;z&quot; = &quot;xy&quot;) paraboloid and lie in the North and South directions.

If the three intersecting hyperbolic paraboloids are drawn far enough that they intersect along the edges of a tetrahedron, then the result is as shown in Figure 4.
One of the lobes is seen frontally—head on—in Figure 4. The lobe can be seen to be one of the four corners of the tetrahedron.

If the continuous surface in Figure 4 has its sharp edges rounded out—smoothed out—then the result is the Roman surface in Figure 5.
One of the lobes of the Roman surface is seen frontally in Figure 5, and its bulbous – balloon-like—shape is evident.

If the surface in Figure 5 is turned around 180 degrees and then turned upside down, the result is as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6 shows three lobes seen sideways. Between each pair of lobes there is a locus of double points corresponding to a coordinate axis. The three loci intersect at a triple point at the origin. The fourth lobe is hidden and points in the direction directly opposite from the viewer. The Roman surface shown at the top of this article also has three lobes in sideways view.

==One-sidedness==
The Roman surface is non-orientable, i.e. one-sided. This is not quite obvious. To see this, look again at Figure 3.
Imagine an ant on top of the &quot;third&quot; hyperbolic paraboloid, &quot;z = x y&quot;. Let this ant move North. As it moves, it will pass through the other two paraboloids, like a ghost passing through a wall. These other paraboloids only seem like obstacles due to the self-intersecting nature of the immersion. Let the ant ignore all double and triple points and pass right through them. So the ant moves to the North and falls off the edge of the world, so to speak. It now finds itself on the northern lobe, hidden underneath the third paraboloid of Figure 3. The ant is standing upside-down, on the &quot;outside&quot; of the Roman surface.

Let the ant move towards the Southwest. It will climb a slope (upside-down) until it finds itself &quot;inside&quot; the Western lobe. Now let the ant move in a Southeastern direction along the inside of the Western lobe towards the &quot;z = 0&quot; axis, always above the &quot;x-y&quot; plane. As soon as it passes through the &quot;z = 0&quot; axis the ant will be on the &quot;outside&quot; of the Eastern lobe, standing rightside-up.

Then let it move Northwards, over &quot;the hill&quot;, then towards the Northwest so that it starts sliding down towards the &quot;x = 0&quot; axis. As soon as the ant crosses this axis it will find itself &quot;inside&quot; the Northern lobe, standing right side up. Now let the ant walk towards the North. It will climb up the wall, then along the &quot;roof&quot; of the Northern lobe. The ant is back on the third hyperbolic paraboloid, but this time under it and standing upside-down. (Compare with Klein bottle.)

==Double, triple, and pinching points==
The Roman surface has four &quot;lobes&quot;. The boundaries of each lobe are a set of three lines of double points. Between each pair of lobes there is a line of double points. The surface has a total of three lines of double points, which lie (in the parametrization given earlier) on the coordinate axes. The three lines of double points intersect at a triple point which lies on the origin. The triple point cuts the lines of double points into a pair of half-lines, and each half-line lies between a pair of lobes. One might expect from the preceding statements that there could be up to eight lobes, one in each octant of space which has been divided by the coordinate planes. But the lobes occupy alternating octants: four octants are empty and four are occupied by lobes.

If the Roman surface were to be inscribed inside the tetrahedron with least possible volume, one would find that each edge of the tetrahedron is tangent to the Roman surface at a point, and that each of these six points happens to be a &quot;Whitney singularity&quot;. These singularities, or pinching points, all lie at the edges of the three lines of double points, and they are defined by this property: that there is no plane tangent to any surface at the singularity.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Carthage ====
* The Carthaginian debt to Rome is fully repaid, meaning that, according to Carthage, the treaty with Rome, which was put in place at the end of the Second Punic War, is no longer in force. The Romans do not agree with this interpretation. Instead they view the treaty as a permanent declaration of Carthaginian subordination to Rome.
* Numidia launches another border raid on Carthaginian soil, besieging a town. In response Carthage launches a large military expedition (25,000 soldiers) to repel the Numidian invaders.

==== Roman Republic ====
* At Polybius&#x27; request, Scipio Aemilianus manages to gain the support of the Roman statesman Cato the Elder (whose son has married Scipio&#x27;s sister Aemilia) for a proposal to release (and return to Greece) the 300 Achaean internees who are still being held without trial after being deported to Rome in 167 BC.
* Roman forces help the thriving Greek commercial port of Massilia combat raids from the Celts from Cisalpine Gaul.
* Roman armies under the leadership of praetor Servius Sulpicius Galba and the proconsul Lucius Licinius Lucullus arrive in Hispania Ulterior and begin the process of subduing the local population. The revolt of the Celtiberians of Numantia is stopped.

==== India ====
* Agnimitra succeeds his father Pushyamitra Shunga as emperor of the Shunga dynasty.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Pushyamitra Shunga, Indian emperor and founder of the Indian Shunga dynasty, who has reigned since 185 BC

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The pretender to the Seleucid throne, Alexander Balas, makes contact with Jonathan Maccabeus offering him terms even more favorable than those offered by the king Demetrius I Soter. In particular, Alexander offers him the official appointment as High Priest in Jerusalem. In response, Jonathan withdraws his support from Demetrius and declares his allegiance to Alexander. Thus Jonathan becomes the first member of his family to achieve appointment as High Priest.

<doc id="59988" wikidata="Q155904" url="?curid=59988" title="Aconitum">
<text>Aconitum (), also known as aconite, monkshood, wolfsbane, leopard&#x27;s bane, devil&#x27;s helmet, or blue rocket, is a genus of over 250 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These herbaceous perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia, growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows.

Most &quot;Aconitum&quot; species are extremely poisonous and must be handled very carefully. Several &quot;Aconitum&quot; hybrids, such as the Arendsii form of &quot;Aconitum carmichaelii&quot;, have won gardening awards—such as the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. Some are used by florists.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;aconitum&quot; comes from the Greek word , which may derive from the Greek &quot;akon&quot; for dart or javelin, the tips of which were poisoned with the substance, or from &quot;akonae&quot;, because of the rocky ground on which the plant was thought to grow. The Greek name &quot;lycoctonum&quot;, which translates literally to &quot;wolf&#x27;s bane&quot;, is thought to indicate the use of its juice to poison arrows or baits used to kill wolves. The English name monkshood refers to the cylindrical helmet, called the galea, distinguishing the flower.

==Description==

The dark green leaves of &quot;Aconitum&quot; species lack stipules. They are palmate or deeply palmately lobed with five to seven segments. Each segment again is trilobed with coarse sharp teeth. The leaves have a spiral (alternate) arrangement. The lower leaves have long petioles.
The tall, erect stem is crowned by racemes of large blue, purple, white, yellow, or pink zygomorphic flowers with numerous stamens. They are distinguishable by having one of the five petaloid sepals (the posterior one), called the galea, in the form of a cylindrical helmet, hence the English name monkshood. Two to 10 petals are present. The two upper petals are large and are placed under the hood of the calyx and are supported on long stalks. They have a hollow spur at their apex, containing the nectar. The other petals are small and scale-like or nonforming. The three to five carpels are partially fused at the base.

The fruit is an aggregate of follicles, a follicle being a dry, many-seeded structure.

Unlike with many species from genera (and their hybrids) in &quot;Ranunculaceae&quot; (and the related &quot;Papaveroideae&quot; subfamily), there are no double-flowered forms.

===Color range===
A medium to dark semi-saturated blue-purple is the typical flower color for &quot;Aconitum&quot; species. &quot;Aconitum&quot; species tend to be variable enough in form and color in the wild to cause debate and confusion among experts when it comes to species classification boundaries. The overall color range of the genus is rather limited, although the palette has been extended a small amount with hybridization. In the wild, some &quot;Aconitum&quot; blue-purple shades can be very dark. In cultivation the shades do not reach this level of depth.

Aside from blue-purple—white, very pale greenish-white, creamy white, and pale greenish-yellow are also somewhat common in nature. Wine red (or red-purple) occurs in a hybrid of the climber &quot;Aconitum hemsleyanum&quot;. There is a pale semi-saturated pink produced by cultivation as well as bicolor hybrids (e.g. white centers with blue-purple edges). Purplish shades range from very dark blue-purple to a very pale lavender that is quite greyish. The latter occurs in the &quot;Stainless Steel&quot; hybrid.

Neutral blue (rather than purplish or greenish), greenish-blue, and intense blues, available in some related &quot;Delphinium&quot; plants—particularly &quot;Delphinium grandiflorum&quot;—do not occur in this genus. &quot;Aconitum&quot; plants that have purplish-blue flowers are often inaccurately referred to as having blue flowers, even though the purple tone dominates. If there are species with true (neutral) blue or greenish-blue flowers they are rare and do not occur in cultivation. Also unlike the genus &quot;Delphinium&quot;, there are no bright red nor intense pink &quot;Aconitum&quot; flowers, as none known are pollinated by hummingbirds. There are no orange-flowered varieties nor any that are green. &quot;Aconitum&quot; is typically more intense in color than &quot;Helleborus&quot; but less intense than &quot;Delphinium&quot;. There are no blackish flowers in &quot;Aconitum&quot;, unlike with &quot;Helleborus&quot;.

Monkshood (&quot;Aconitum napellus&quot;) produces light indigo-blue flowers, while Wolf&#x27;s Bane (&quot;Aconitum vulparia&quot;) produces whitish or straw-yellow flowers.

===Horticultural trade morphology===

The lack of double-flowered forms in the horticultural trade stands in contrast with the other genera of &quot;Ranunculaceae&quot; used regularly in gardens. This includes one major genus that is known solely by most gardeners for a double-flowered form of one species—&quot;Ranunculus asiaticus&quot;, known colloquially in the trade as &quot;Ranunculus&quot;. The Ranunculus genus contains approximately 500 species. One other species of Ranunculus has seen minor use in gardens, the &#x27;Flore Pleno&#x27; (doubled) form of &quot;Ranunculus acris&quot;. Doubled forms of &quot;Consolida&quot; and &quot;Delphinium&quot; dominate the horticultural trade while single forms of &quot;Anemone&quot;, &quot;Aquilegia&quot;, &quot;Clematis&quot;, &quot;Helleborus&quot;, &quot;Pulsatilla&quot;—and the related &quot;Papaver&quot;—retain some popularity. No doubled forms of &quot;Aconitum&quot; are known.

==Ecology==
&quot;Aconitum&quot; species have been recorded as food plant of the caterpillars of several moths. The yellow tiger moth &quot;Arctia flavia&quot;, and the purple-shaded gem &quot;Euchalcia variabilis&quot; are at home on &quot;A. vulparia&quot;. The engrailed &quot;Ectropis crepuscularia&quot;, yellow-tail &quot;Euproctis similis&quot;, mouse moth &quot;Amphipyra tragopoginis&quot;, pease blossom &quot;Periphanes delphinii&quot;, and &quot;Mniotype bathensis&quot;, have been observed feeding on &quot;A. napellus&quot;. The purple-lined sallow &quot;Pyrrhia exprimens&quot;, and &quot;Blepharita amica&quot; were found eating from &quot;A. septentrionale&quot;. The dot moth &quot;Melanchra persicariae&quot; occurs both on &quot;A. septentrionale&quot; and &quot;A. intermedium&quot;. The golden plusia &quot;Polychrysia moneta&quot; is hosted by &quot;A. vulparia&quot;, &quot;A. napellus&quot;, &quot;A. septentrionale&quot;, and &quot;A. intermedium&quot;. Other moths associated with &quot;Aconitum&quot; species include the wormwood pug &quot;Eupithecia absinthiata&quot;, satyr pug &quot;E. satyrata&quot;, &quot;Aterpia charpentierana&quot;, and &quot;A. corticana&quot;. It is also the primary food source for the Old World bumblebees &quot;Bombus consobrinus&quot; and &quot;Bombus gerstaeckeri&quot;.

Aconitum flowers are pollinated by long-tongued bumblebees. Bumblebees have the strength to open the flowers and reach the single nectary at the top of the flower on its inside. Some short-tongued bees will bore holes into the tops of the flowers to steal nectar. However, alkaloids in the nectar function as a deterrent for species unsuited to pollination. The effect is greater in certain species, such as &quot;Aconitum napellus&quot;, than in others, such as &quot;Aconitum lycoctonum&quot;. Unlike the species with blue-purple flowers such as &quot;A. napellus&quot;, &quot;A. lycoctonum&quot;—which has off-white to pale yellow flowers, has been found to be a nectar source for butterflies. This is likely due to the nectary flowers of the latter being more easily reachable by the butterflies; however, the differing alkaloid character of the two plants may also play a significant role or be the primary influence.

==Cultivation==

The species typically utilized by gardeners fare well in well-drained evenly moist &quot;humus-rich&quot; garden soils like many in the related Helleborus and Delphinium genera, and can grow in the partial shade. Species not used in gardens tend to require more exacting conditions (e.g. &quot;Aconitum noveboracense&quot;). Most &quot;Aconitum&quot; species prefer to have their roots cool and moist, with the majority of the leaves exposed to sun, like the related &quot;Clematis&quot;. &quot;Aconitum&quot; species can be propagated by divisions of the root or by seeds, with care taken to avoid leaving pieces of the root where livestock might be poisoned. All parts of these plants should be handled while wearing protective disposable gloves. &quot;Aconitum&quot; plants are typically much longer-lived than the closely related delphinium plants, putting less energy into floral reproduction. As a result, they are not described as being &quot;heavy feeders&quot; (needing a higher quantity of fertilizer versus most other flowering plants)—unlike gardeners&#x27; delphiniums. As with most in the &quot;Ranunculaceae&quot; and &quot;Papaveraceae&quot; families, they dislike root disturbance. As with most in Ranunculaceae, seeds that are not planted soon after harvesting should be stored moist-packed in vermiculite to avoid dormancy and viability issues. The German seed company Jelitto offers &quot;Gold Nugget&quot; seeds that are advertised as utilizing a coating that enables the seed to germinate immediately, bypassing the double dormancy defect (from a typical gardener&#x27;s point of view) &quot;Aconitum&quot;—and many other species in Ranunculaceae genera—use as a reproductive strategy. By contrast, seeds that are not immediately planted or moist-packed are described as perhaps taking as long as two years to germinate, being prone to very erratic germination (in terms of time required per seed), and comparatively quick seed viability loss (e.g. &quot;Adonis&quot;). These issues are typical for many species in Ranunculaceae, such as &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; (pasqueflower).

===Award-winning hybrids===
In the UK, the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

* &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;cammarum&quot; &#x27;Bicolor&#x27;
* &quot;A. carmichaelii&quot; &#x27;Arendsii&#x27;
* &quot;A. carmichaelii&quot; &#x27;Kelmscott&#x27; 
* &quot;A.&quot; &#x27;Bressingham Spire&#x27;
* &quot;A.&quot; &#x27;Spark&#x27;s Variety&#x27;
* &quot;A.&quot; &#x27;Stainless Steel&#x27;

==Toxicology==

Monkshood and other members of the genus &quot;Aconitum&quot; contain substantial amounts of the highly toxic aconitine and related alkaloids, especially in their roots and tubers. As little as 2 mg of aconitine or 1 g of plant may cause death from respiratory paralysis or heart failure.

Aconitine is a potent neurotoxin and cardiotoxin that causes persistent depolarization of neuronal sodium channels in tetrodotoxin-sensitive tissues. The influx of sodium through these channels and the delay in their repolarization increases their excitability and may lead to diarrhea, convulsions, ventricular arrhythmia, and death.

Marked symptoms may appear almost immediately, usually not later than one hour, and &quot;with large doses death is almost instantaneous&quot;. Death usually occurs within two to six hours in fatal poisoning (20 to 40 ml of tincture may prove fatal). The initial signs are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This is followed by a sensation of burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth and face, and of burning in the abdomen. In severe poisonings, pronounced motor weakness occurs and cutaneous sensations of tingling and numbness spread to the limbs. Cardiovascular features include hypotension, sinus bradycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias. Other features may include sweating, dizziness, difficulty in breathing, headache, and confusion. The main causes of death are ventricular arrhythmias and asystole, or paralysis of the heart or respiratory center. The only &quot;post mortem&quot; signs are those of asphyxia.

Treatment of poisoning is mainly supportive. All patients require close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac rhythm. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal can be used if given within one hour of ingestion. The major physiological antidote is atropine, which is used to treat bradycardia. Other drugs used for ventricular arrhythmia include lidocaine, amiodarone, bretylium, flecainide, procainamide, and mexiletine. Cardiopulmonary bypass is used if symptoms are refractory to treatment with these drugs. Successful use of charcoal hemoperfusion has been claimed in patients with severe aconitine poisoning.

Mild toxicity (headache, nausea and palpitations) as well as severe toxicity may be experienced from skin contact. Paraesthesia, including tingling and feelings of coldness in the face and extremities, is common in reports of toxicity.

==Uses==
===Folk medicine===
Aconite was described in Greek and Roman folk medicine by Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Pliny the Elder, Folk medicinal use of &quot;Aconitum&quot; species is practiced in some parts of Slovenia.

&quot;Aconitum chasmanthum&quot; is listed as critically endangered, &quot;Aconitum heterophyllum&quot; as endangered, and &quot;Aconitum violaceum&quot; as vulnerable due to overcollection for use as an herbal medicine.

A producer of Yunnan Baiyao, a traditional Chinese medicine remedy, has disclosed the remedy contains aconite.

===As a poison===
The roots of &quot;A. ferox&quot; supply the Nepalese poison called &quot;bikh&quot;, &quot;bish&quot;, or &quot;nabee&quot;. It contains large quantities of the alkaloid pseudaconitine, which is a deadly poison. The root of &quot;A. luridum&quot;, of the Himalaya, is said to be as poisonous as that of &quot;A. ferox&quot; or &quot;A. napellus&quot;.

Several species of &quot;Aconitum&quot; have been used as arrow poisons. The Minaro in Ladakh use &quot;A. napellus&quot; on their arrows to hunt ibex, while the Ainu in Japan used a species of &quot;Aconitum&quot; to hunt bear as did the Matagi hunters of the same region before their adoption of firearms. The Chinese also used &quot;Aconitum&quot; poisons both for hunting and for warfare. &quot;Aconitum&quot; poisons were used by the Aleuts of Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Islands for hunting whales. Usually, one man in a kayak armed with a poison-tipped lance would hunt the whale, paralyzing it with the poison and causing it to drown. &quot;Aconitum&quot; tipped arrows are also described in the Rig Veda.

It has, albeit rarely, been hypothesized that Socrates was executed via an extract from an &quot;Aconitum&quot; species, such as &quot;Aconitum napellus&quot;, rather than via hemlock, &quot;Conium maculatum&quot;. &quot;Aconitum&quot; was commonly used by the ancient Greeks as an arrow poison but can be used for other forms of poisoning. It has been hypothesized that Alexander the Great and Ptolemy XIV Philopator were murdered via aconite.

In a review of Alisha Rankin&#x27;s &quot;The Poison Trials&quot;, Alison Abbott, writing in &quot;Nature&quot;, reports Rankin&#x27;s proposal of 1524 as the first human trial with a control arm, indicating the book&#x27;s description of a 16th century source presenting Pope Clement VII poisoning a pair of prisoners with aconite-laced marzipan, testing an antidote on one that survived, leaving the untreated prisoner to suffer a painful death.

In April 2021, the president of Kyrgyzstan, Sadyr Japarov, promoted aconite root as a treatment for COVID-19. Subsequently, at least four people were admitted to hospital suffering from poisoning. Facebook had previously removed the President&#x27;s posts advocating use of the substance, saying &quot;We&#x27;ve removed this post as we do not allow anyone, including elected officials, to share misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm or spread false claims about how to cure or prevent COVID-19&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

Genetic analysis suggests that &quot;Aconitum&quot; as it was delineated before the 21st century is nested within &quot;Delphinium&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot;, that also includes &quot;Aconitella&quot;, &quot;Consolida&quot;, &quot;Delphinium staphisagria&quot;, &quot;D. requini&quot;, and &quot;D. pictum&quot;. Further genetic analysis has shown that the only species of the subgenus &quot;&quot;Aconitum (Gymnaconitum)&quot;, &quot;&quot;A. gymnandrum&quot;, is sister to the group that consists of &quot;Delphinium (Delphinium)&quot;, &quot;Delphinium (Delphinastrum)&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Consolida&quot; plus &quot;&quot;Aconitella&quot;. To make &quot;Aconitum&quot; monophyletic, &quot;&quot;A. gymnandrum&quot; has now been reassigned to a new genus, &quot;Gymnaconitum&quot;. To make &quot;Delphinium&quot; monophyletic, the new genus &quot;Staphisagria&quot; was erected containing &quot;S. staphisagria&quot;, &quot;S. requini&quot;, and &quot;S. pictum&quot;.

==In literature and popular culture==

Aconite and wolfsbane have been understood to be poisonous from ancient times, and are frequently represented as such in literature. In Greek mythology, the goddess Hecate is said to have invented aconite, which Athena used to transform Arachne into a spider. Medea is also said to have attempted to poison Theseus with a cup of wine poisoned with wolf&#x27;s bane.

In the poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Ovid tells of the herb coming from the slavering mouth of Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guarded the gates of Hades. In his Natural History, Pliny the Elder supports the legend that aconite came from the saliva of the dog Cerberus when Hercules dragged him from the underworld. As the veterinary historian John Blaisdell has noted, symptoms of aconite poisoning in humans bear similarity to those of rabies: frothy saliva, impaired vision, vertigo, and finally, coma; thus, ancient Greeks could have believed that this poison, mythically born of Cerberus&#x27;s lips, was literally the same as found inside the mouth of a rabid dog.

===In popular culture===
====Early examples====

As a well-known poison from ancient times, aconite (including as wolfsbane, in its various spellings) often found place in historical fiction. In &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, Livia, wife of Augustus, was portrayed discussing the merits, antidotes, and use of aconite with a poisoner. It is the poison used by a murderer in the third of the Cadfael Chronicles, &quot;Monk&#x27;s Hood&quot; by Ellis Peters, published in 1980 and set in 1138 in Shrewsbury, England. 

The kyōgen (traditional Japanese comedy) play , which is well-known and frequently taught in Japan, is centered on dried aconite root used for traditional Chinese medicine. Taken from Shasekishu, a 13th-century anthology collected by Mujū, the story describes servants who decide that the dried aconite root is really sugar, and suffer unpleasant though nonlethal symptoms after eating it.

In the 16th century, Shakespeare, writing in &quot;Henry IV Part II&quot; Act 4 Scene 4, refers to aconite, alongside rash gunpowder, working as strongly as the &quot;venom of suggestion&quot; to break up close relationships.

====20th century and later====

And an overdose of aconite was the method by which Rudolph Bloom, father of Leopold Bloom in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, died by suicide.

In the 1931 classic horror film &quot;Dracula&quot; starring Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula and Helen Chandler as Mina Seward, reference is made to wolf&#x27;s bane (&quot;aconitum&quot;); towards the end of the film, &quot;Van Helsing holds up a sprig of wolf&#x27;s bane&quot;. Van Helsing educates the nurse protecting Mina from Count Dracula to place sprigs of wolf&#x27;s bane around Mina&#x27;s neck for protection, instructing that wolf&#x27;s bane, a plant that grows in Central Europe, is used by those dwelling there to protect themselves against vampires.

In the 1941 film &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; starring Lon Chaney Jr. and Claude Rains, the following poem is recited several times:Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolf-bane blooms and the autumn moon is bright. In the 1943 French novel &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot;, the boy Culafroy eats &quot;Napel aconite&quot;, so that the &quot;Renaissance would take possession of the child through the mouth.&quot;

Aconite and wolfsbane have also appeared in a references in modern settings. In the early 1980s, famed Spanish horror film star Paul Naschy named his production company &quot;Aconito Films&quot;, an in-joke relating to the large number of werewolf movies he produced. In the 2003 Korean television series &quot;Dae Jang Geum&quot;, set in the 15th and 16th centuries, Choi put &quot;wolf&#x27;s bane&quot; in the previous queen&#x27;s food. 

In the 1980 novel &quot;Monk&#x27;s-Hood&quot;, third in Ellis Peters&#x27; series &quot;The Cadfael Chronicles&quot; and set in 1138, a wealthy donator to Shrewsbury Abbey, Gervase Bonel, is murdered with stolen Monks-hood liniment prepared by the Abbey&#x27;s herbalist Brother Cadfael, who needs to identify the true culprit to exonerate Bonel&#x27;s stepson Edwin.

In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series by J.K. Rowling, describing aconitum is one of three questions that Professor Snape asks Harry Potter during his first Potions class in the first novel. Snape&#x27;s preparations of the drug as a treatment for lycanthropy are also an important plot point in the third novel.

In the TV series &quot;Dexter&quot;, serial killer Hannah McKay (a love interest of protagonist Dexter Morgan) has a history of using aconite to murder her victims.

This family of poisons makes a showing in S. M. Stirling&#x27;s 2000 science fiction novel, &quot;On the Oceans of Eternity&quot;, where a renegade warlord is poisoned with aconite-laced food by his own chief of internal security. In the 2000s television show &quot;Merlin&quot;, the titular character attempts to poison Arthur with aconite while under a spell.

In the 2010s TV series &quot;Forever&quot;, Dr. Henry Morgan identifies the plants in the villain&#x27;s greenhouse as specifically &quot;Aconitum variegatum&quot;, which he has used to create a poison to release into the ventilation system of Grand Central Terminal. In the television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (2011-2019), a Tywin Lannister&#x27;s commander is assassinated by a dart, identified by Tywin as &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Bane&quot; due to its scent. In the second season of the BBC drama &quot;Shakespeare and Hatherway&quot;, episode 9, a tennis player is poisoned through the skin of his palm by aconite smeared on the handle of his racquet.

In the 2024 Netflix thriller &quot;Carry-On&quot;, the Traveller (played by Jason Bateman) murders some of his targets by poisoning them with aconitum.

===In mysticism===
Wolf&#x27;s bane is used as an analogy for the power of divine communion in &quot;Liber 65&quot; 1:13–16, one of Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Holy Books of Thelema&quot;. Wolf&#x27;s bane is mentioned in one verse of Lady Gwen Thompson&#x27;s 1974 poem &quot;Rede of the Wiccae&quot;, a long version of the Wiccan Rede: &quot;Widdershins go when Moon doth wane, And the werewolves howl by the dread wolfsbane.&quot;

<text>Aconitine is an alkaloid toxin produced by various plant species belonging to the genus &quot;Aconitum&quot; (family Ranunculaceae), commonly known by the names wolfsbane and monkshood. Aconitine is notorious for its toxic properties.

==Structure and reactivity==
Biologically active isolates from &quot;Aconitum&quot; and &quot;Delphinium&quot; plants are classified as norditerpenoid alkaloids, which are further subdivided based on the presence or absence of the C18 carbon. Aconitine is a C19-norditerpenoid, based on its presence of this C18 carbon. It is barely soluble in water, but very soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform or diethyl ether. Aconitine is also soluble in mixtures of alcohol and water if the concentration of alcohol is high enough.

Like many other alkaloids, the basic nitrogen atom in one of the six-membered ring structure of aconitine can easily form salts and ions, giving it affinity for both polar and lipophilic structures (such as cell membranes and receptors) and making it possible for the molecule to pass the blood–brain barrier. The acetoxyl group at the c8 position can readily be replaced by a methoxy group, by heating aconitine in methanol, to produce a 8-deacetyl-8-&quot;O&quot;-methyl derivatives. If aconitine is heated in its dry state, it undergoes a pyrolysis to form pyroaconitine ((1α,3α,6α,14α,16β)-20-ethyl-3,13-dihydroxy-1,6,16-trimethoxy-4-(methoxymethyl)-15-oxoaconitan-14-yl benzoate) with the chemical formula C32H43NO9.

==Mechanism of action==
Aconitine can interact with the voltage-dependent sodium-ion channels, which are proteins in the cell membranes of excitable tissues, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles and neurons. These proteins are highly selective for sodium ions. They open very quickly to depolarize the cell membrane potential, causing the upstroke of an action potential. Normally, the sodium channels close very rapidly, but the depolarization of the membrane potential causes the opening (activation) of potassium channels and potassium efflux, which results in repolarization of the membrane potential.

Aconitine binds to the channel at the neurotoxin binding site 2 on the alpha subunit (the same site bound by batrachotoxin, veratridine, and grayanotoxin). This binding results in a sodium-ion channel that stays open longer. Aconitine suppresses the conformational change in the sodium-ion channel from the active state to the inactive state. The membrane stays depolarized due to the constant sodium influx (which is 10–1000-fold greater than the potassium efflux). As a result, the membrane cannot be repolarized. The binding of aconitine to the channel also leads to the channel to change conformation from the inactive state to the active state at a more negative voltage. In neurons, aconitine increases the permeability of the membrane for sodium ions, resulting in a huge sodium influx in the axon terminal. As a result, the membrane depolarizes rapidly. Due to the strong depolarization, the permeability of the membrane for potassium ions increases rapidly, resulting in a potassium reflux to release the positive charge out of the cell. Not only the permeability for potassium ions but also the permeability for calcium ions increases as a result of the depolarization of the membrane. A calcium influx takes place. The increase of the calcium concentration in the cell stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic membrane to open the sodium-channels there, generating a new action potential.

Research with mouse nerve-hemidiaphragm muscle preparation indicate that at low concentrations (&lt;0.1 μM) aconitine increases the electrically evoked acetylcholine release causing an induced muscle tension. Action potentials are generated more often at this concentration. At higher concentration (0.3–3 μM) aconitine decreases the electrically evoked acetylcholine release, resulting in a decrease in muscle tension. At high concentration (0.3–3 μM), the sodium-ion channels are constantly activated, transmission of action potentials is suppressed, leading to non-excitable target cells or paralysis.

==Biosynthesis and total synthesis of related alkaloids==
Aconitine is biosynthesized by the monkshood plant via the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway (MEP chloroplast pathway). Approximately 700 naturally occurring C19-diterpenoid alkaloids have been isolated and identified, but the biosynthesis of only a few of these alkaloids are well understood.

Likewise, only a few alkaloids of the aconitine family have been synthesized in the laboratory. In particular, despite over one hundred years having elapsed since its isolation, the prototypical member of its family of norditerpenoid alkaloids, aconitine itself, represents a rare example of a well-known natural product that has yet to succumb to efforts towards its total synthesis. The challenge that aconitine poses to synthetic organic chemists is due to both the intricate interlocking hexacyclic ring system that makes up its core and the elaborate collection of oxygenated functional groups at its periphery. A handful of simpler members of the aconitine alkaloids, however, have been prepared synthetically. In 1971, the Weisner group discovered the total synthesis of talatisamine (a C19-norditerpenoid). In the subsequent years, they also discovered the total syntheses of other C19-norditerpenoids, such as chasmanine, and 13-deoxydelphonine.

The total synthesis of napelline (Scheme a) begins with aldehyde 100. In a 7 step process, the A-ring of napelline is formed (104). It takes another 10 steps to form the lactone ring in the pentacyclic structure of napelline (106). An additional 9 steps creates the enone-aldehyde 107. Heating in methanol with potassium hydroxide causes an aldol condensation to close the sixth and final ring in napelline (14). Oxidation then gives rise to diketone 108 which was converted to (±)-napelline (14) in 10 steps.

A similar process is demonstrated in Wiesner&#x27;s synthesis of 13-desoxydelphinone (Scheme c). The first step of this synthesis is the generation of a conjugated dienone 112 from 111 in 4 steps. This is followed by the addition of a benzyl vinyl ether to produce 113. In 11 steps, this compound is converted to ketal 114. The addition of heat, DMSO and o-xylene rearranges this ketol (115), and after 5 more steps (±)-13-desoxydelphinone (15) is formed.

Lastly, talatisamine (Scheme d) is synthesized from diene 116 and nitrile 117. The first step is to form tricycle 118 in 16 steps. After another 6 steps, this compound is converted to enone 120. Subsequently, this allene is added to produce photoadduct 121. This adduct group is cleaved and rearrangement gives rise to the compound 122. In 7 steps, this compound forms 123, which is then rearranged, in a similar manner to compound 114, to form the aconitine-like skeleton in 124. A racemic relay synthesis is completed to produce talatisamine (13).

More recently, the laboratory of the late David Y. Gin completed the total syntheses of the aconitine alkaloids nominine and neofinaconitine.

==Metabolism==

Aconitine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYPs). There has been research in 2011 in China to investigate in-depth the CYPs involved in aconitine metabolism in human liver microsomes. It has been estimated that more than 90 percent of currently available human drug metabolism can be attributed to eight main enzymes (CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5). The researchers used recombinants of these eight different CYPs and incubated it with aconitine. To initiate the metabolism pathway the presence of NADPH was needed. Six CYP-mediated metabolites (M1–M6) were found by liquid chromatography, these six metabolites were characterized by mass-spectrometry. The six metabolites and the involved enzymes are summarized in the following table:
Selective inhibitors were used to determine the involved CYPs in the aconitine metabolism. The results indicate that aconitine was mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, 3A5 and 2D6. CYP2C8 and 2C9 had a minor role to the aconitine metabolism, whereas CYP1A2, 2E1 and 2C19 did not produce any aconitine metabolites at all. The proposed metabolic pathways of aconitine in human liver microsomes and the CYPs involved to it are summarized in the table above.

==Uses==
Aconitine was previously used as an antipyretic and analgesic and still has some limited application in herbal medicine, although the narrow therapeutic index makes calculating appropriate dosage difficult. Aconitine is also present in Yunnan Baiyao, a proprietary traditional Chinese medicine.

==Toxicity==
Consuming as little as 2 milligrams of pure aconitine or 1 gram of the plant itself may cause death by paralyzing respiratory or heart functions. Toxicity may occur through the skin; even touching the flowers can numb finger tips.

The toxic effects of aconitine have been tested in a variety of animals, including mammals (dog, cat, guinea pig, mouse, rat and rabbit), frogs and pigeons. Depending on the route of exposure, the observed toxic effects were local anesthetic effect, diarrhea, convulsions, arrhythmias or death. According to a review of different reports of aconite poisoning in humans, the following clinical features were observed:

* Neurological: paresthesia and numbness of face, perioral area and four limbs; muscle weakness in four limbs
* Cardiovascular: hypotension, palpitations, chest pain, bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, ventricular ectopics and other arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, and junctional rhythm
* Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea
* Others: dizziness, hyperventilation, sweating, difficulty breathing, confusion, headache, and lacrimation

Progression of symptoms: the first symptoms of aconitine poisoning appear approximately 20 minutes to 2 hours after oral intake and include paresthesia, sweating and nausea. This leads to severe vomiting, colicky diarrhea, intense pain and then paralysis of the skeletal muscles. Following the onset of life-threatening arrhythmia, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, death finally occurs as a result of respiratory paralysis or cardiac arrest.

 values for mice are 1 mg/kg orally, 0.100 mg/kg intravenously, 0.270 mg/kg intraperitoneally and 0.270 mg/kg subcutaneously. The lowest published lethal dose (LDLo) for mice is 1 mg/kg orally and 0.100 mg/kg intraperitoneally. The lowest published toxic dose (TDLo) for mice is 0.0549 mg/kg subcutaneously. LD50 value for rats is 0.064 mg/kg intravenously. The LDLo for rats is 0.040 mg/kg intravenously and 0.250 mg/kg intraperitoneally. The TDLo for rats is 0.040 mg/kg parenterally. For an overview of more test animal results (LD50, LDLo and TDLo) see the following table.
* Note that LD50 means lethal dose, 50 percent kill; LDLo means lowest published lethal dose; TDLo means lowest published toxic dose

For humans the lowest published oral lethal dose of 28 μg/kg was reported in 1969.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
For the analysis of the &quot;Aconitum&quot; alkaloids in biological specimens such as blood, serum and urine, several GC-MS methods have been described. These employ a variety of extraction procedures followed by derivatisation to their trimethylsilyl derivatives. New sensitive HPLC-MS methods have been developed as well, usually preceded by SPE purification of the sample. The antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine has been reported to be an effective treatment of aconitine poisoning of a patient. Considering the fact that aconitine acts as an agonist of the sodium channel receptor, antiarrhythmic agents which block the sodium channel (Vaughan-Williams&#x27; classification I) might be the first choice for the therapy of aconitine induced arrhythmias. Animal experiments have shown that the mortality of aconitine is lowered by tetrodotoxin. The toxic effects of aconitine were attenuated by tetrodotoxin, probably due to their mutual antagonistic effect on excitable membranes. Also paeoniflorin seems to have a detoxifying effect on the acute toxicity of aconitine in test animals. This may result from alternations of pharmacokinetic behavior of aconitine in the animals due to the pharmacokinetic interaction between aconitine and paeoniflorin. In addition, in emergencies, one can wash the stomach using either tannic acid or powdered charcoal. Heart stimulants such as strong coffee or caffeine may also help until professional help is available.

==Famous poisonings==
During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a British detachment was the target of attempted poisoning with aconitine by the Indian regimental cooks. The plot was thwarted by John Nicholson who, having detected the plot, interrupted the British officers just as they were about to consume the poisoned meal. The chefs refused to taste their own preparation, whereupon it was force-fed to a monkey who &quot;expired on the spot&quot;. The cooks were hanged.

Aconitine was the poison used by George Henry Lamson in 1881 to murder his brother-in-law in order to secure an inheritance. Lamson had learned about aconitine as a medical student from professor Robert Christison, who had taught that it was undetectable—but forensic science had improved since Lamson&#x27;s student days.

Rufus T. Bush, American industrialist and yachtsman, died on September 15, 1890, after accidentally taking a fatal dose of aconite.

In 1953 aconitine was used by a Soviet biochemist and poison developer, Grigory Mairanovsky, in experiments with prisoners in the secret NKVD laboratory in Moscow. He admitted killing around 10 people using the poison.

In 2004 Canadian actor Andre Noble died from aconitine poisoning. He accidentally ate some monkshood while he was on a hike with his aunt in Newfoundland.

In 2009 Lakhvir Singh of Feltham, west London, used aconitine to poison the food of her ex-lover Lakhvinder Cheema (who died as a result of the poisoning) and his current fiancée Gurjeet Choongh. Singh received a life sentence with a 23-year minimum for the murder on February 10, 2010.

In 2022, twelve diners at a restaurant in York Region became acutely ill following a meal. All twelve became seriously ill and four of them were admitted to the intensive care unit after the suspected poisoning.

==In popular culture==
Aconitine was a favorite poison in the ancient world. The poet Ovid, referring to the proverbial dislike of stepmothers for their step-children, writes:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Lurida terribiles miscent aconita novercae&quot;.

Fearsome stepmothers mix lurid aconites.&lt;/poem&gt; 

Aconitine was also made famous by its use in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1891 story &quot;Lord Arthur Savile&#x27;s Crime&quot;. Aconite also plays a prominent role in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, in which the father to protagonist Leopold Bloom used pastilles of the chemical to commit suicide. Aconitine poisoning plays a key role in the murder mystery &quot;Breakdown&quot; by Jonathan Kellerman (2016). In &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; season 3 part 13, aconitine is suggested as a means to poison the main character.

&quot;Monk&#x27;s Hood&quot; is the name of the third Cadfael novel written in 1980 by Ellis Peters. The novel was made into an episode of the television series &quot;Cadfael&quot; starring Derek Jacobi.

In the third season of the Netflix series &quot;You&quot;, two of the main characters poison each other with aconitine. One survives (due to a lower dose and an antidote), and the other is killed. 

Hannah McKay (Yvonne Strahovski), a serial killer in the Showtime series &quot;Dexter&quot; uses aconite on at least three occasions to poison her victims.

In season 2 episode 16 of the series &quot;Person Of Interest&quot;, aconitine is shown in a syringe stuck to the character Shaw (Sarah Shahi) nearly being injected and causing her death, until she is rescued by Reese (Jim Caviezel).

In a 2017 episode of &quot;The Doctor Blake Mysteries&quot;, fight manager Gus Jansons (Steve Adams) murdered his boxer, Mickey Ellis (Trey Coward), during a match by applying aconitine he had put in petroleum jelly and applying it to a cut over the boxer’s eye. He feared being blackmailed over a murder he helped cover up. He had made the poison from wolfsbane he had seen in a local garden. 

Aconitine poisoning is used by Villanelle to kill the Ukrainian gangster, Rinat Yevtukh in &quot;Killing Eve: No Tomorrow&quot; by Luke Jennings (2018).

<text>&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991), released on DGC Records. Having sold over 13 million units worldwide, it is one of the best-selling songs of all time. The success propelled &quot;Nevermind&quot; to the top of several albums charts and is often marked as the point when grunge entered the mainstream. It was Nirvana&#x27;s biggest hit, charting high on music industry charts around the world in 1991 and 1992, and was number one on the charts in Belgium, France, New Zealand and Spain. 

The guitarist and singer, Kurt Cobain, described &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; as an attempt to write &quot;the ultimate pop song&quot;, inspired by the soft-and-loud dynamics of the Pixies. The title derives from a phrase written by his friend Kathleen Hanna, the singer of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill: &quot;Kurt smells like Teen Spirit.&quot; Hanna was referencing the deodorant Teen Spirit, but Cobain misinterpreted it as a revolutionary slogan. 

The music video depicts a high school pep rally which ends in chaos, inspired by Jonathan Kaplan&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Over the Edge&quot; and the Ramones&#x27; film &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;. It won two MTV Video Music Awards, and was in heavy rotation on MTV during the 1990s. Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV&#x27;s programming department, said the video &quot;changed the entire look of MTV&quot; by giving the channel &quot;a whole new generation to sell to&quot;. In 2000, the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; named &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; the most played video on MTV Europe.

&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was met with acclaim and described as an &quot;anthem for apathetic kids&quot; of Generation X. It was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of &quot;The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. In 2001, the Recording Industry Association of America ranked it number 80 on their Songs of the Century list. In 2002, &quot;NME&quot; named it the second-greatest single, and in 2013 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it the greatest. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; fifth on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2017, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Writing and recording==
&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was one of several songs written following Nirvana&#x27;s first recording sessions with producer Butch Vig in 1990. Lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain began writing it a few weeks before recording their second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, in 1991. He said it was an attempt to write a song in the style of the Pixies, a band he admired:

When Cobain presented the song to his bandmates, it comprised just the main guitar riff and the chorus vocal melody. Cobain said the riff was &quot;clichéd&quot;, similar to a riff by Boston or the Richard Berry song &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. Bassist Krist Novoselic dismissed it as &quot;ridiculous&quot;; in response, Cobain made the band play it for an hour and a half. Eventually, Novoselic began playing it more slowly, inspiring drummer Dave Grohl to create the drum beat, which drew from disco artists such as the Gap Band. As a result, it is the only song on &quot;Nevermind&quot; to credit all three band members as writers.

The title derives from a phrase written on Cobain&#x27;s wall by his friend Kathleen Hanna, singer of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill: &quot;Kurt smells like Teen Spirit.&quot; Hanna meant that Cobain smelled like the deodorant Teen Spirit, which she and Tobi Vail, his then-girlfriend, had discovered during a trip to the grocery store. Cobain said that he was unaware of the deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted it as a revolutionary slogan, as they had been discussing anarchism and punk rock.

Prior to the album recording, the band sent Vig demos for songs including &quot;Teen Spirit&quot;. While the sound was distorted due to the band playing at a high volume, Vig felt it had promise. Vig and the band recorded &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; at Sound City Studios in the Los Angeles, California neighborhood of Van Nuys in May1991. Vig suggested changes to the arrangement, including moving a guitar ad lib to the chorus and shortening the chorus. The band recorded the basic track in three takes, and used the second take. Vig corrected some timing errors created by Cobain switching between his guitar effects pedals. Cobain recorded only three vocal takes; according to Vig, &quot;I was lucky to ever get Kurt to do four takes.&quot;

==Music==
&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; is a grunge and alternative rock song. It was recorded in the original key of F minor and follows a F5-B5-A5-D5 chord progression, with the main guitar riff constructed from four power chords played in a syncopated sixteenth note strum by Cobain. The guitar chords were double tracked to create a &quot;more powerful&quot; sound. The chords occasionally lapse into suspended chord voicings as a result of Cobain playing the bottom four strings of the guitar for the thickness of sound. The riff resembles that of Boston&#x27;s 1976 hit &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, though it is not identical - the band would sometimes play a fragment of that song as an introduction. During the verses, Cobain used a Small Clone effect pedal to add a chorus effect.

&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; uses a &quot;somewhat conventional formal structure&quot; consisting of four-, eight-, and twelve-bar sections, including an eight-bar verse, an eight-bar pre-chorus, and a twelve-bar chorus. Musicologist Graeme Downes, who led the band the Verlaines, says that &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; illustrates developing variation. Elements of the structure are marked with shifts in volume and dynamics, moving from quiet to loud several times. This structure of &quot;quiet verses with wobbly, chorused guitar, followed by big, loud hardcore-inspired choruses&quot; became an alternative rock template.

During the verses, the band maintains the same chord progression as the chorus. Cobain plays a two-note guitar line over Novoselic&#x27;s root-note eighth note bassline, which outlines the chord progression. Approaching the chorus, Cobain begins to play the same two notes on every beat of the measure and repeats the word &quot;Hello&quot;. Following the first and second choruses, Cobain simultaneously sings the word &quot;Yay&quot; and performs a unison bend on his guitar. After the second chorus, Cobain plays a 16-bar guitar solo restating his vocal melody from the verse and pre-chorus. During the closing refrain, Cobain sings &quot;A denial&quot; repeatedly; his voice becomes strained from the force of yelling.

==Lyrics and interpretation==
The lyrics to &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; were often difficult for listeners to decipher, both due to their nonsensicality and because of Cobain&#x27;s slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was compounded by the fact that the &quot;Nevermind&quot; album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, &quot;We can&#x27;t play this. I can&#x27;t understand what the guy is saying.&quot; MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album—and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs—were later released with the liner notes of the &quot;Lithium&quot; single in 1992. American rock critic Dave Marsh noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was &quot;the &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; of the nineties&quot; and wrote, &quot;Like &#x27;Louie&#x27;, only more so, &#x27;Teen Spirit&#x27; reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently.&quot; Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song&#x27;s sheet music that &quot;what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang&quot;, and added, &quot;Worst of all, I&#x27;m not sure that I know more about [the meaning of] &#x27;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#x27; now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts.&quot;

The book &quot;Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song&quot; describes &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; as &quot;a typically murky Cobain exploration of meaning and meaninglessness&quot;. Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain&#x27;s contradictory lyrics (such as &quot;It&#x27;s fun to lose and to pretend&quot;) and states &quot;the point that emerges isn&#x27;t just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator—he&#x27;s angry that he&#x27;s confused&quot;. Azerrad&#x27;s conclusion is that the song is &quot;alternately a sarcastic reaction to the idea of actually having a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea&quot;. Additionally, the &quot;famously obscure couplet&quot;—&quot;A mulatto, an albino / A mosquito, my libido&quot;—is, according to Azerrad, &quot;nothing more than two pairs of opposites, a funny way of saying the narrator is very horny&quot;. In &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot;, Charles R. Cross&#x27; biography of Cobain, Cross argues that the song is a reference to Cobain&#x27;s relationship with ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. Cross cites the line &quot;She&#x27;s over-bored and self-assured&quot; and states the song &quot;could not have been about anyone else&quot;. Cross backs up his argument with lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, such as &quot;Who will be the King &amp; Queen of the outcasted teens&quot;.

&quot;Teen Spirit&quot; is widely interpreted as a teen revolution anthem, an interpretation reinforced by the music video. In an interview conducted the day &quot;Nevermind&quot; was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, &quot;We still feel as if we&#x27;re teenagers because we don&#x27;t follow the guidelines of what&#x27;s expected of us to be adults ... It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme.&quot; In Michael Azerrad&#x27;s biography &quot;Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, Cobain said he felt a duty &quot;to describe what I felt about my surroundings and my generation and people my age&quot;. He also said, &quot;The entire song is made up of contradictory ideas ... It&#x27;s just making fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it&#x27;s a nice thought.&quot; As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the meaning. Grohl stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, &quot;Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has a lot to say about something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes.&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was released to radio on August 27, 1991. On September 10, it was released as the lead single from &quot;Nevermind&quot;, Nirvana&#x27;s major label debut on DGC Records. The song did not initially chart, and it sold well only in regions of the United States with an established Nirvana fanbase.

The single was intended to be a base-building alternative rock cut from the album, and was not expected to be a hit; the follow-up &quot;Come as You Are&quot; was planned as the single that could cross over to mainstream radio formats. However, campus and modern rock radio stations placed &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; on heavy rotation. Danny Goldberg of Nirvana&#x27;s management firm Gold Mountain said: &quot;None of us heard it as a crossover song, but the public heard it and it was instantaneous ... They heard it on alternative radio, and then they rushed out like lemmings to buy it.&quot;

The video received its world premiere on MTV&#x27;s late-night alternative rock program &quot;120 Minutes&quot; on September 29, and proved so popular that the channel began to air it during its regular daytime rotation. MTV added the video to its &quot;Buzz Bin&quot; selection in October, where it stayed until mid-December. By the end of the year, the song, music video, and the &quot;Nevermind&quot; album had become hits. &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Nevermind&quot; became a rare cross-format phenomenon, reaching all the major rock radio formats including modern rock, hard rock, album rock, and college radio.

&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was also a critical and commercial success. It topped the 1991 &quot;Village Voice&quot; &quot;Pazz &amp; Jop&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; year-end polls and reached number two on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of best singles of the year. The single peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart the same week that &quot;Nevermind&quot; reached number one on the albums chart. &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; hit number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and has been certified platinum (onemillion copies shipped) by the Recording Industry Association of America. However, many American Top 40 stations were reluctant to play the song in regular rotation and restricted it to night-time play.

The single was also successful in other countries. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was released on November 18, 1991, reaching number seven on the UK Singles Chart and charting for 184 weeks. The song was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal and Best Rock Song. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; would later name Nirvana&#x27;s loss to Eric Clapton in the Best Rock Song category as one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history. Outside the United States, the song topped the charts of Belgium, France, New Zealand, and Spain. It charted within the top five of several European countries and reached number five in Australia. In Israel, it was voted in at number 2 on the IBA&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Israel&quot; singles chart. It appeared on several year-end charts, including number 10 in New Zealand, number 17 in Belgium and Germany, and number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Year-End Chart.

In the wake of Nirvana&#x27;s success, Michael Azerrad wrote in a 1992 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article: &quot;&#x27;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#x27; is an anthem for (or is it against?) the &#x27;Why Ask Why?&#x27; generation. Just don&#x27;t call Cobain a spokesman for a generation.&quot; Nevertheless, the music press awarded the song an &quot;anthem-of-a-generation&quot; status, placing Cobain as a reluctant spokesman for Generation X. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&#x27;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#x27; could be this generation&#x27;s version of the Sex Pistols″ 1976 single, &#x27;Anarchy in the U.K.&#x27;, if it weren&#x27;t for the bitter irony that pervades its title ... as Nirvana knows only too well, teen spirit is routinely bottled, shrink-wrapped and sold&quot;.

Nirvana grew uncomfortable with the song&#x27;s success and, in later concerts, often excluded it from the set list. Prior to the release of the band&#x27;s 1993 follow-up album &quot;In Utero&quot;, Novoselic remarked, &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for &#x27;Teen Spirit&#x27; I don&#x27;t know how &quot;Nevermind&quot; would have done ... There are no &#x27;Teen Spirits&#x27; on &quot;In Utero&quot;.&quot; Cobain said in 1994, &quot;I still like playing &#x27;Teen Spirit&#x27;, but it&#x27;s almost an embarrassment to play it ... Everyone has focused on that song so much.&quot;

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was the first for director Samuel Bayer. Bayer believed he was hired because his test reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be &quot;punk&quot; and &quot;not corporate&quot;. The video is based on the concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot, inspired by Jonathan Kaplan&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Over the Edge&quot; and the Ramones&#x27; film &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;. It had an estimated budget of between $30,000 and $50,000.

The video was filmed on August 17, 1991, on Stage 6 of GMT Studios in Culver City. It features Nirvana playing at a pep rally in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the Circle-A anarchist symbol. The video features an appearance by Burton C. Bell, later known as frontman of heavy metal band Fear Factory. Occasionally, the scene cuts to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a push broom handle. The video ends with the students destroying the set and the band&#x27;s gear. The discontent was genuine; the extras who filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to mosh, and the set became a scene of chaos. &quot;Once the kids came out dancing they just said &#x27;fuck you&#x27;, because they were so tired of his shit throughout the day,&quot; Cobain said.

Cobain disliked Bayer&#x27;s final edit and oversaw a re-edit of the video, creating the final version. One of Cobain&#x27;s major additions was the penultimate shot, a close-up of his face after it had been obscured for most of the video. Another major change involved two sequences of a principal standing next to a loudspeaker and being sprayed with confetti, and a teacher dressed like a nerd dancing to the song with a &quot;Dunce&quot; cap before being tied to a basketball hoop pole. Cobain had the principal footage and most of the teacher footage removed, aside from the ending scene which shows the teacher tied to the pole as the janitor sweeps the floor. Bayer said that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain was not vain, and was more interested that &quot;the video had something that was truly about what they were about&quot;.

=== Reception ===
The music video received positive reviews. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer David Fricke described the video as looking like &quot;the greatest gig you could ever imagine&quot;. In addition to a number-one placing in the singles category, &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; also topped the music video category in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;″s 1991 &quot;Pazz &amp; Jop&quot; poll. The video won Nirvana the Best New Artist and Best Alternative Group awards at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, and in 2000 the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; named &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; the Most Played Video on MTV Europe. Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV&#x27;s Programming department, later said the video &quot;changed the entire look of MTV&quot; by giving them &quot;a whole new generation to sell to&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the music video for &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; at number two on their 1993 list of &quot;The 100 Top Music Videos&quot;. MTV ranked the song&#x27;s music video at number three on its &quot;100 Greatest Music Videos Ever Made&quot; list in 1999. VH1 placed the debut of the &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; video at number eighteen on its 2000 list of &quot;100 Greatest Rock &amp; Roll Moments on TV&quot;, noting that it made alternative rock &quot;a commercial and pop culture force&quot;. In 2001, VH1 named it the fourth-greatest video. The video was parodied in &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s music video for &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; and referenced in Bob Sinclar&#x27;s 2006 music video for &quot;Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now)&quot;. By December 25, 2019 the video had been viewed 1 billion times on YouTube.

==Live performances==
&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, while shorter clips are included on the &quot;Classic Albums″ Nevermind&quot; DVD, as well as the documentary film &quot;Hype!&quot;. As the song&#x27;s lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with &quot;Come out and play, make up the rules&quot; instead of the eventual opening of &quot;Load up on guns, bring your friends&quot;. A recording of the earlier version appears on &quot;With the Lights Out&quot; and again on &quot;&quot;. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary &quot;1991: The Year Punk Broke&quot;, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth.

The international television debut performance of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was on 8 November 1991, on the UK TV series &quot;The Word&quot;. Cobain opened by declaring: &quot;I want everyone in this room to know that Courtney Love, the lead singer of the sensational pop group Hole, is the best fuck in the world.&quot; Cobain and Love married the following year.

Nirvana often altered the song&#x27;s lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line &quot;our little group has always been&quot; changed to &quot;our little tribe has always been&quot;, which can be heard on the 1996 live album &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that the &quot;Wishkah&quot; version of &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; &quot;[found] Cobain&#x27;s guitar reeling outside the song&#x27;s melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit&quot;. A notable alternate performance of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; occurred on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain deliberately sang the whole song an octave lower and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, &quot;Load up on guns, bring your friends&quot; became &quot;Load up on drugs, kill your friends&quot;). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was cancelled in 2006, &quot;The Observer&quot; listed Nirvana&#x27;s performance of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; as the third greatest in the show&#x27;s history. This performance can be found on the 1994 home video &quot;Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!&quot;.

==Legacy==
Dubbed an &quot;anthem for apathetic kids&quot; of Generation X, in the years following Cobain&#x27;s 1994 suicide and Nirvana&#x27;s breakup &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; has continued to garner critical acclaim, and is often listed as one of the greatest songs of all time. It was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of &quot;The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot; in 1997. In 2000, VH1 rated the song at number forty-one on its &quot;100 Greatest Rock Songs&quot; list, while MTV and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it third on their joint list of the &quot;100 Greatest Pop Songs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV/RS 2000&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Recording Industry Association of America placed &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; at number eighty on their 2001 &quot;Songs of the Century&quot; list. In 2002, &quot;NME&quot; awarded the song the number two spot on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Singles of All Time&quot;, with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranking it at number one on its own list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singles of All Time&quot;. VH1 placed &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; at number one on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years&quot; in 2003, while that same year, the song came third in a &quot;Q&quot; poll of the &quot;1001 Best Songs Ever&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; fifth on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. The song was placed at number six in &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;Global Best Song Ever Poll&quot; in 2005. In 2022, it was included in the list &quot;The story of &quot;NME&quot; in 70 (mostly) seminal songs&quot;: Mark Beaumont wrote that with this song, Nirvana rejuvenated American rock, &quot;honing the melodic roars of Husker Du, Pixies, Dinosaur Jr and Sonic Youth into an MTV friendly quiet-loud dynamic&quot;.

In the 2006 VH1 UK poll &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Lyric&quot;, the line &quot;I feel stupid and contagious / Here we are now, entertain us&quot; was ranked the third-favorite lyric by over 13,000 voters. VH1 placed &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; at number one on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songs Of The &#x27;90s&quot; in 2007, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number ten on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2009, the song was voted number one for the third time in a row on the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time in Australia (it was first place previously in 1991 and 1998). That year, VH1 ranked the song seventh on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs&quot;. Despite previously proposing in its 2006 entry for &quot;Nevermind&quot; on &quot;The All-TIME 100 Albums&quot; that &quot;&#x27;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#x27; ... may be the album&#x27;s worst song&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine later included it on its list of &quot;The All-TIME 100 Songs&quot; in 2011. That same year, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; kept its number nine ranking on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s updated list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, while in 2019, the magazine ranked it at number one in its list of &quot;50 Best Songs of the Nineties&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; placed the song at number two on its list of the &quot;100 Best Tracks Of The &#x27;90s&quot; in 2012, and at number one on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2014. In 2015, the song was also named the most iconic song of all time according to a study by Goldsmith&#x27;s College, which analysed various songs featured in numerous &#x27;all-time best&#x27; lists, using analytical software to compare their key, BPM, chord variety, lyrical content, timbral variety, and sonic variance the result of which designated the title to this song. In 2017, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was rereleased as a limited edition 7-inch vinyl single in December2011. In an attempt to emulate a successful 2009 Facebook campaign to promote Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s song &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, an online campaign was launched to promote &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; to 2011 Christmas number one in the UK Singles Chart in protest at the dealings of &quot;The X Factor&quot; television series with the children&#x27;s charity Rhythmix. A similar campaign was also launched in Ireland to get the track to 2011 Christmas number one in the Irish Singles Chart. The campaign resulted in the song reaching number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, selling 30,000 copies. According to Nielsen Music&#x27;s year-end report for 2019, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was the most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio with 145,000 spins. All of the songs in the top 10 were from the 1990s. In June 2021, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; became the second song from the 1990s to reach 1 billion streams on the Spotify platform. As of 2024, the song ranked at number 80 for list of Spotify streaming records. With 2.203 billion streams on Spotify, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; became the most streamed songs from the 90s.

==Covers and parodies==

Tori Amos recorded the song and released it in 1992 on her &quot;Crucify&quot; EP single. Dave Grohl commented on Nirvana covers in 1996: &quot;There are a few bands that go out there and do Nirvana covers and it&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous, That&#x27;s almost like desecration, that&#x27;s what I think of it as. Tori Amos&#x27; take on it (Smells Like Teen Spirit) was fine. I mean that was pretty hilarious. She can do whatever the hell she wants.&quot; &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic parodied the song in 1992 with &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot;, a song about Nirvana itself. Cobain quickly gave permission, but asked, &quot;It&#x27;s not about food, is it?&quot; Yankovic answered, &quot;No, it&#x27;s about how nobody can understand your lyrics.&quot; Upon hearing the parody, Cobain and his bandmates laughed hysterically. Yankovic has said Cobain told him he realized that Nirvana had &quot;made it&quot; when he heard the parody. In 1995, the queercore band Pansy Division released a cover version with altered lyrics titled &quot;Smells Like Queer Spirit&quot; on their &quot;Pile Up&quot; album. Pansy Division guitarist Jon Ginoli insisted that his band&#x27;s version of the song was not a parody but &quot;an affectionate tribute&quot;. In the 2011 film &quot;The Muppets&quot; and its soundtrack, one of the acts of the Muppet Telethon involves Rowlf the Dog, Link Hogthrob, Sam Eagle, and Beaker performing the song as a barbershop quartet, where unwilling special guest Jack Black accuses them of &quot;ruining one of the greatest songs of all time&quot;. The 2015 film &quot;Pan&quot; features a cover of the song performed by Hugh Jackman in character as the pirate Blackbeard and other members of the cast in a musical sequence that introduces the character and his crew. It was selected for the scene after other traditional pirate songs &quot;just wasn&#x27;t jelling&quot; with the filmmakers during rehearsals. A version recorded by singer Malia J is used in the opening credits sequence of the 2021 film &quot;Black Widow&quot;.

<doc id="59995" wikidata="Q1509663" url="?curid=59995" title="Battle of Dunbar (1296)">
<text>The Battle of Dunbar was the only significant field action of the campaign of 1296 during the beginning of the First War of Scottish Independence.

==Background==

King Edward I of England had invaded Scotland in March 1296 to punish King John Balliol for his refusal to support English military action in France. After the sack of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Edward rushed to complete the conquest of Scotland, remained in the town for a month, supervising the strengthening of its defences. On 5 April, he received a message from King John renouncing his homage, to which he remarked, &quot;O&#x27; foolish knave! What folly he commits. If he will not come to us we will go to him.&quot;

The next objective in the campaign was the Earl of March&#x27;s castle at Dunbar, a few miles up the coast from Berwick. March was with the English, but his wife, Marjory Comyn, sister of the Earl of Buchan, did not share her husband&#x27;s political loyalties and allowed her fellow Scots to occupy the castle. Edward sent one of his chief lieutenants, John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, John Balliol&#x27;s own father-in-law, northwards with a strong force of knights to invest the stronghold. The defenders sent messages to King John, who bivouacked with the main body of his army at nearby Haddington, asking for urgent assistance. In response the army, or a large part of it, advanced to the rescue of Dunbar. John, who was showing even less skill as a commander than he had as a king, did not accompany it. The campaign of 1296 was now to enter its final phase.

==Battle==
==Aftermath==
The battle of Dunbar effectively ended the war of 1296 with an English victory. The remainder of the campaign was little more than a grand mopping-up operation. James, the hereditary High Steward of Scotland, surrendered the important fortress at Roxburgh without attempting a defence, and others were quick to follow his example. Only Edinburgh Castle held out for a week against Edward&#x27;s siege engines. A Scottish garrison sent out to help King John, who had fled north to Forfar, were told to provide for their own safety. Edward himself, true to his word, advanced into central and northern Scotland in pursuit of King John. Stirling Castle, which guarded the vital passage across the River Forth was deserted save for a janitor who stayed behind to hand the keys to the English. John reached Perth on 21 June, where he received messages from Edward asking for peace.

John Balliol surrendered and submitted himself to a protracted abasement. At Kincardine Castle on 2 July he confessed to rebellion and prayed for forgiveness. Five days later in the kirkyard of Stracathro he abandoned the treaty with the French. The final humiliation came at Montrose on 8 July. Dressed for the occasion John was ceremoniously stripped of the vestments of royalty. Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham, ripped the red and gold arms of Scotland from his surcoat, thus bequeathing to history the nickname &quot;Toom Tabard&quot; (empty coat) by which John has been known to generations of Scottish schoolchildren. He and his son Edward were sent south into captivity. Soon after, the English king followed, carrying in his train the Stone of Scone and other relics of Scottish nationhood.

==Battlefield site==

The battlefield was considered for protection by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy 2009.

In 2012 the site was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland (). Historic Environment Scotland reports that no archaeological discoveries have been reported from the battle site, and that a 2007 dig failed to yield any battle-related finds. However, it considers that weaponry and other metal objects from the battle may lie undiscovered in the topsoil.

<text>Eliza Rosanna Gilbert, Countess of Landsfeld (17 February 1821 – 17 January 1861), better known by the stage name Lola Montez (), was an Irish dancer and actress who became famous as a Spanish dancer, courtesan, and mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who made her Gräfin von Landsfeld ([[Countess]] of Landsfeld). At the start of the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, she was forced to flee. She proceeded to the United States via Austria, Switzerland, France and London, to return to her work as an entertainer and lecturer.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Eliza Rosanna Gilbert was born into an Anglo-Irish family, the daughter of Elizabeth (&quot;Eliza&quot;) Oliver, who was the daughter of Charles Silver Oliver, a former High Sheriff of Cork and member of Parliament for Kilmallock in County Limerick, Ireland. Their residence was the former Castle Oliver which stood a thousand yards to the south-west of the current castle by the same name. In December 1818, Eliza&#x27;s parents, Ensign Edward Gilbert and Eliza Oliver, met when he arrived with the 25th Regiment. They were married on 29 April 1820, and Lola was born the following February, in the village of Grange in the north of County Sligo, refuting persistent rumours that her mother was pregnant with her at the time of the wedding. The young family made their residence at King House in Boyle, County Roscommon, until early 1823, when they journeyed to Liverpool, England, and later departed for India on 14 March.

Published reports differ regarding the actual date of Eliza&#x27;s birth. For many years, it was accepted that she was born in the city of Limerick, as she herself claimed, possibly on 23 June 1818; this is the year that was graven on her headstone. However, when her baptismal certificate came to light in the late 1990s, it was established that Eliza Rosanna Gilbert was actually born in Grange, County Sligo, in Connacht, Ireland, on 17 February 1821. At the time of her birth, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. She was baptised at St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Liverpool, England, on 16 February 1823, while her family was &quot;en route&quot; to her father&#x27;s post in India.

Shortly after their arrival in India, Edward Gilbert died of cholera. Her mother, who was then 19, married Lieutenant Patrick Craigie the following year. Craigie quickly came to care for the young Eliza, but her spoiled and half-wild ways concerned him greatly. Eventually, it was agreed she would be sent back to Britain to attend school, staying with Craigie&#x27;s father in Montrose, Scotland. But the &quot;queer, wayward little Indian girl&quot; rapidly became known as a mischief-maker. On one occasion, she stuck flowers into the wig of an elderly man during a church service; on another, she ran through the streets naked.

At the age of ten, Eliza was moved again—this time to Sunderland, England, where her stepfather&#x27;s older sister, Catherine Rae, set up a boarding school in Monkwearmouth with her husband. Eliza continued her education there. Eliza&#x27;s determination and temper were to become her trademarks. Her stay in Sunderland lasted only a year, as she was then transferred to a school in Camden Place (now Camden Crescent), Bath, for a more sophisticated education.

In 1837, sixteen-year-old Eliza eloped with Lieutenant Thomas James, and they married. The couple separated five years later, in Calcutta, India, and she became a professional dancer under a stage name.

When she had her London debut as &quot;Lola Montez, the Spanish dancer&quot; in June 1843, she was recognised as &quot;Mrs. James&quot;. The resulting notoriety hampered her career in England, so she departed for the continent, where she had success in Paris and Warsaw. At this time, she was almost certainly accepting favours from a few wealthy men, and was regarded by many as a courtesan.
===Life as a courtesan===

In 1844, Eliza, now known as Lola Montez, made a personally disappointing Parisian stage debut as a dancer in Fromental Halévy&#x27;s opera &quot;Le lazzarone&quot;. She met and had an affair with Franz Liszt, who introduced her to the circle of George Sand. After performing in various European capitals, she settled in Paris, where she was accepted into the city&#x27;s literary bohemia, becoming acquainted with Alexandre Dumas, with whom she was also rumoured to have had a dalliance. In Paris she would meet , &quot;owner of the newspaper with the highest circulation in France, and also the newspaper&#x27;s drama critic&quot;. Through their romance, Montez revitalised her career as a dancer. Later on, after the two had their first quarrel over Lola&#x27;s attendance at a party, Dujarrier attended the party and, in a drunken state, offended . When Dujarrier was challenged to a duel by de Beauvallon, Dujarrier was shot and killed.

In 1846, she arrived in Munich, where she was discovered by and became the mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. There was a rumour that when they first met, Ludwig asked her in public if her breasts were real. Her response to the question was to tear off enough of her garments to prove that they were. She soon began to use her influence on the king and this, coupled with her arrogant manner and outbursts of temper, made her extremely unpopular with the Bavarian people (particularly after documents were made public showing that she was hoping to become a naturalised Bavarian subject and be elevated to nobility). Despite opposition, Ludwig made her Countess of Landsfeld and Baroness of Rosenthal on his next birthday, 25 August 1847, and along with her title, he granted her a large annuity.

For more than a year, she exercised great political power, which she directed in favour of liberalism, anti-Catholicism, and in attacks against the Jesuits. Her ability to manipulate the king was so great that the Minister of State, Karl von Abel, was dismissed because he and his entire cabinet had objected to Lola being granted Bavarian nationality and the title of countess. The students at Munich University were divided in their sympathies, and conflicts arose shortly before the outbreak of the revolutions of 1848, which led the king, at Lola&#x27;s insistence, to close the university.

In March 1848, under pressure from a growing revolutionary movement, the university was re-opened, Ludwig abdicated in favor of his son, King Maximilian II, and Montez fled Bavaria, ending her career as a power behind the throne. It seems likely that Ludwig&#x27;s relationship with Montez contributed greatly to his forced abdication despite his previous popularity.

After a sojourn in Switzerland, where she waited in vain for Ludwig to join her, Lola made one brief excursion to France and then removed to London in late 1848. There she met and quickly married George Trafford Heald, a young army cornet (cavalry officer) with a recent inheritance. But the terms of her divorce from Thomas James did not permit either spouse&#x27;s remarriage while the other was living, and the beleaguered newlyweds were forced to flee the country to escape a bigamy action brought by Heald&#x27;s scandalised maiden aunt. The Healds resided for a time in France and Spain, but within two years the tempestuous relationship was in tatters. George would survive a reported drowning in Lisbon in 1853, but three years later would be dead from tuberculosis. Meanwhile Lola in 1851 set off to make a new start in the United States, where she was surprisingly successful at first in rehabilitating her image.

===American career===

From 1851 to 1853, Lola performed as a dancer and actress in the eastern United States, one of her offerings being a play called &quot;Lola Montez in Bavaria&quot;. In May 1853, she arrived on the west coast in San Francisco, where her performances created a sensation, but soon inspired a popular satire, &quot;Who&#x27;s Got the Countess?&quot; She married Patrick Hull, a local newspaperman, in July and moved to Grass Valley, California, in August. Her marriage soon failed; a doctor named as in the divorce suit brought against her was murdered shortly thereafter.

Lola remained in Grass Valley at her little house for nearly two years. The restored property went on to become California Historical Landmark No. 292. Lola served as an inspiration to another aspiring young entertainer, Lotta Crabtree, whose parents ran a boarding house in Grass Valley. Lola, a neighbour, provided dancing lessons and encouraged Lotta&#x27;s enthusiasm for performance.

===Australia tour===
In June 1855, Lola departed the U.S. to tour Australia and resume her career by entertaining miners at the gold diggings during the gold rush of the 1850s. She arrived in Sydney on 16 August 1855.

Historian Michael Cannon claims that &quot;in September 1855 she performed her erotic Spider Dance at the Theatre Royal in Melbourne, raising her skirts so high that the audience could see she wore no underclothing at all. Next day, &quot;The Argus&quot; thundered that her performance was &#x27;utterly subversive to all ideas of public morality&#x27;. Respectable families ceased to attend the theatre, which began to show heavy losses.&quot;

She earned further notoriety in Ballarat when, after reading a bad review of her performance in &quot;The Ballarat Times&quot;, she attacked the editor, Henry Seekamp, with a whip. Although the &quot;Lola Montes Polka&quot; (composed by Albert Denning) is rumoured to have been inspired by this event, the song was published in 1855 and the incident with Seekamp occurred months later in February 1856. At Castlemaine in April 1856, she was &quot;rapturously encored&quot; after her Spider Dance in front of 400 diggers (including members of the Municipal Council who had adjourned their meeting early to attend the performance), but drew the wrath of the audience after insulting them following some mild heckling.

She departed for San Francisco on 22 May 1856. On the return voyage her manager was lost at sea after going overboard.

===Later life in the U.S.===
Lola failed in her attempts at a theatrical comeback in various American cities. She arranged in 1857 to deliver a series of moral lectures in Britain and America written by Rev. Charles Chauncey Burr. She spent her last days in rescue work among women. In November 1859, &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot; reported that Lola Montez was:

living very quietly up town, and doesn&#x27;t have much to do with the world&#x27;s people. Some of her old friends, the Bohemians, now and then drop in to have a little chat with her, and though she talks beautifully of her present feelings and way of life, she generally, by way of parenthesis, takes out her little tobacco pouch and makes a cigarette or two for self and friend, and then falls back upon old times with decided gusto and effect. But she doesn&#x27;t tell anybody what she&#x27;s going to do.

===Burial===

By 1860, Lola was showing the tertiary effects of syphilis, and her body began to waste away. She died at the age of 39 on 17 January 1861. She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where her tombstone erroneously lists her age at death as 42, reading &quot;Mrs. Eliza Gilbert | Died 17 January 1861 | Æ. 42&quot;.

==In popular culture==

*Lola Montez has been mentioned by several writers as a possible source of inspiration for the character Irene Adler in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes story &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;. The character bears certain similarities to Montez, as a popular performer who influences national politics through her relationship with a powerful individual.
*Lola&#x27;s life was first portrayed in the 1919 biopic &quot;Lola Montez&quot; by Leopoldine Konstantin.
*Lola&#x27;s life was portrayed in the 1922 German film &quot;Lola Montez, the King&#x27;s Dancer&quot;. Montez is played by Ellen Richter.

*A character named Lola Montez is featured in the 1948 film &quot;Black Bart&quot;, played by Yvonne De Carlo. This was after the success of her breakthrough portrayal of the titular &quot;Salome, Where She Danced&quot; (1945), which was loosely based upon Montez&#x27;s life story.
*Philip Van Doren Stern&#x27;s novel &quot;Lola: A Love Story&quot; (Rinehart &amp; Co., 1949) was based on her life.

*The actress Paula Morgan played Montez in the 1955 episode, &quot;Lola Montez&quot;, of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Baynes Barron (1917–1982) was cast as Patrick Hull, a newspaperman who became Montez&#x27;s third husband.
*Montez&#x27;s time in the Australian goldfields was the subject of the musical &quot;Lola Montez&quot; staged in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney in 1958 starring Mary Preston.

*Montez appears in &quot;Royal Flash&quot; by George MacDonald Fraser, where she has a brief affair with Sir Harry Flashman. She is also a character in the film of the same name (1975), in which she is played by Florinda Bolkan.
*In one of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s last fictional works, &quot;The Pavilion of Masks&quot;, she is unmistakably the original for Cleo Torres, Spanish dancer and mistress of a German prince.
*Montez was allegedly the inspiration for Jennifer Wilde&#x27;s historical romance novel &quot;Dare To Love&quot; (1978), whose protagonist Elena Lopez is also a British woman passing herself off as Spanish who becomes an exotic dancer. In the book, Elena has an affair with Franz Liszt, becomes friends with George Sand and has a friendship with the king of a small Germanic country obviously based on Ludwig I of Bavaria, then moves to California, all documented as having happened in Montez&#x27;s life.

<text>A bassist (also known as a bass player or bass guitarist) is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass (upright bass, contrabass, wood bass), bass guitar (electric bass, acoustic bass), keyboard bass (synth bass) or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or trombone. Many musical genres tend to be associated with at least one or more of these instruments. 

==Overview==
Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&amp;B, soul, rock, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands. Tuba players are sometimes conflated with bassists, due to the instrument being used to double a part for the double bass in early music recordings. Tubists who tend to fill the role of a bassist include Howard Johnson, Herbie Flowers and Steve Brown among others.

Despite the associations of different bass instruments with certain genres, there are exceptions. Some rock bands and bassists used a double bass, such as Lee Rocker of Stray Cats, Barenaked Ladies and Tiger Army. Larry Graham, Bernard Edwards, Mick Hogan, Andy Fraser, and Mel Schacher used an electric bass guitar. Some funk, R&amp;B and jazz, fusion groups use synth bass or keyboard bass rather than electric bass. Stevie Wonder, Bootsy Collins, and Bernie Worrell have used a synth bass. Some traditional jazz bands use double bass or electric bass instead of a tuba; Bill Johnson and Steve Brown was one of the earliest double bassists in the New Orleans traditional jazz genre. In some jazz groups and jam bands, the basslines are played by a Hammond organ player, who uses the bass pedal keyboard or the lower manual for the low notes. Keyboard driven bass also occurs occasionally in rock bands, such as Atomic Rooster, and the Doors whose keyboardist Ray Manzarek notably used a Fender Rhodes piano bass with his left hand.

== Electric bass players ==
Electric bassists play the bass guitar. In most rock, pop, metal and country genres, the bass line outlines the harmony of the music being performed, while simultaneously indicating the rhythmic pulse. In addition, there are many different standard bass line types for different genres and types of song (e.g. blues ballad, fast swing, etc.). 

Bass lines often emphasize the root note, with a secondary role for the third, and fifth of each chord being used in a given song. In addition, pedal tones (repeated or sustained single notes), ostinatos, and bass riffs are also used as bass lines. While most electric bass players rarely play chords (three or more notes all sounded at the same time), chords are used in some styles, especially funk, R&amp;B, soul music, jazz, rock, Latin and heavy metal music. Phil Lesh, a bassist for the rock band Grateful Dead was known for treating bass lines as counterparts, rather than emphasizing the root note. Lemmy Kilmister, bassist for rock bands Hawkwind and Motörhead, was described by some musicians and writers to have a playing style reminiscent of an acoustic guitarist, sometimes using chords.

<text>Aotearoa () is the Māori-language name for New Zealand. The name was originally used by Māori in reference only to the North Island, with the whole country being referred to as &quot;Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu&quot; – where &quot;Te Ika-a-Māui&quot; means North Island, and &quot;Te Waipounamu&quot; means South Island. In the pre-European era, Māori did not have a collective name for the two islands.

Several meanings for Aotearoa have been proposed; the most popular translation usually given is &quot;land of the long white cloud&quot;, or variations thereof. This refers to the cloud formations which are believed to have helped early Polynesian navigators find the country in Māori oral tradition.

Beginning in the late 20th century, &quot;Aotearoa&quot; has become widespread in the bilingual naming of national organisations and institutions. Since the 1990s, it has been customary for particular parties to sing the New Zealand national anthem, &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot; (or &quot;Aotearoa&quot;), in both Māori and English, which further exposed the name to a wider audience.

New Zealand English speakers pronounce the word with various degrees of approximation to the original Māori pronunciation, from at one end of the spectrum (nativist) to at the other. Pronunciations documented in dictionaries of English include , , and .

==Origin==
The original meaning of is not known. The word can be broken up as: (&#x27;cloud&#x27;, &#x27;dawn&#x27;, &#x27;daytime&#x27; or &#x27;world&#x27;), (&#x27;white&#x27;, &#x27;clear&#x27; or &#x27;bright&#x27;) and (&#x27;long&#x27;). It can also be broken up as , the name of one of the migratory canoes that travelled to New Zealand, and (&#x27;long&#x27;). The most common literal translation is &#x27;long white cloud&#x27;, commonly lengthened to &#x27;the land of the long white cloud&#x27;. Alternative translations include &#x27;long bright world&#x27; or &#x27;land of abiding day&#x27;, possibly referring to New Zealand having longer summer days in comparison to those further north in the Pacific Ocean.

===Mythology===
In some traditional stories, &quot;Aotearoa&quot; was the name of the canoe () of the explorer Kupe, and he named the land after it. Kupe&#x27;s wife Kūrāmarotini (in some versions, his daughter) was watching the horizon and called (&#x27;a cloud! a cloud!&#x27;). Other versions say the canoe was guided by a long white cloud in the course of the day and by a long bright cloud at night. On arrival, the sign of land to Kupe&#x27;s crew was the long cloud hanging over it. The cloud caught Kupe&#x27;s attention and he said &quot;Surely is a point of land&quot;. Due to the cloud which greeted them, Kupe named the land &quot;Aotearoa&quot;.

==Usage==
It is not known when Māori began incorporating the name into their oral lore. Beginning in 1845, George Grey, Governor of New Zealand, spent some years amassing information from Māori regarding their legends and histories. He translated it into English, and in 1855 published a book called &quot;Polynesian Mythology and Ancient Traditional History of the New Zealand Race&quot;. In a reference to Māui, the culture hero, Grey&#x27;s translation from the Māori reads as follows:

Thus died this Maui we have spoken of; but before he died he had children, and sons were born to him; some of his descendants yet live in Hawaiki, some in &quot;Aotearoa&quot; (or in these islands); the greater part of his descendants remained in Hawaiki, but a few of them came here to &quot;Aotearoa&quot;.
The use of &quot;Aotearoa&quot; to refer to the whole country is a post-colonial custom. Before the period of contact with Europeans, Māori did not have a commonly used name for the entire New Zealand archipelago. As late as the 1890s the name was used in reference to the North Island (&quot;Te Ika-a-Māui&quot;) only; an example of this usage appeared in the first issue of &quot;Huia Tangata Kotahi&quot;, a Māori-language newspaper published on 8 February 1893. It contained the dedication on the front page, &quot;He perehi tenei mo nga iwi Maori, katoa, o Aotearoa, mete Waipounamu&quot;, meaning &quot;This is a publication for the Māori tribes of the North Island and the South Island&quot;.

After the adoption of the name New Zealand (anglicised from &quot;Nova Zeelandia&quot;) by Europeans, one name used by Māori to denote the country as a whole was &quot;Niu Tireni&quot;, a respelling of New Zealand derived from an approximate pronunciation.

The expanded meaning of &quot;Aotearoa&quot; among &quot;Pākehā&quot; became commonplace in the late 19th century. &quot;Aotearoa&quot; was used for the name of New Zealand in the 1878 translation of &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;, by Judge Thomas Henry Smith of the Native Land Court—this translation is widely used today when the anthem is sung in Māori. Additionally, William Pember Reeves used &quot;Aotearoa&quot; to mean New Zealand in his history of the country published in 1898, &quot;The Long White Cloud Ao-tea-roa.&quot;
Since the late 20th century &quot;Aotearoa&quot; is becoming widespread also in the bilingual names of national organisations, such as the National Library of New Zealand / Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa.

The New Zealand province of the Anglican Church is divided into three cultural streams or (Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia), with the &quot;Aotearoa&quot; tikanga covering Māori-speaking congregations within New Zealand.

In 2015, to celebrate Te Wiki o te Reo Māori (Māori Language Week), the Black Caps (the New Zealand national cricket team) played under the name &quot;Aotearoa&quot; for their first match against Zimbabwe.

===Music===
* &quot;Aotearoa&quot; is an overture composed in 1940 by Douglas Lilburn. 
* &quot;The Land of the Long White Cloud&quot;, subtitled &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, is a piece composed in 1979 by Philip Sparke for brass band or wind band.
* &quot;Aotearoa&quot; is the Māori version of &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;, a national anthem of New Zealand.
* Split Enz refers to Aotearoa in its 1982 song &quot;Six Months in a Leaky Boat&quot;.

== Petitions ==
A petition initiated by Danny Tahau Jobe for a referendum on whether the official name of New Zealand should change to include &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, received 6,310 signatures.

In September 2021, Te Pāti Māori started a petition to change the name of New Zealand to Aotearoa. The petition reached 50,000 signatures in two days.

By early June 2022, Te Pāti Māori&#x27;s petition to rename New Zealand &quot;Aotearoa&quot; had received over 70,000 signatures. On 2 June, the petition was submitted before Parliament&#x27;s committee. Party co-leader Rawiri Waititi argued that the proposed name change would recognise New Zealand&#x27;s indigenous heritage and strengthen its identity as a Pacific country. Waititi objected to the idea of a referendum, claiming it would entrench the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. National Party leader Christopher Luxon stated that renaming New Zealand was a constitutional issue that would require a referendum. Māori Development Minister Willie Jackson expressed concerns that a potential name change would create branding issues for the country&#x27;s tourism industry.

== Opinion polling ==
A &quot;1News&quot;–Colmar Brunton poll in September 2021 found that 58% of respondents wanted to keep the name &quot;New Zealand&quot;, 9% wanted to change the name to &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, and 31% wanted the joint name of &quot;Aotearoa New Zealand&quot;. A January 2023 &quot;Newshub&quot;-Reid Research poll showed a slight increase in support for the name &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, with 36.2% wanting &#x27;Aotearoa New Zealand&quot;, 9.6% &quot;Aotearoa&quot; only, and 52% wanting to keep &quot;New Zealand&quot; only.

<text>In Māori mythology, taniwha () are large supernatural beings that live in deep pools in rivers, dark caves, or in the sea, especially in places with dangerous currents or deceptive breakers (giant waves).
They may be considered highly respected kaitiaki (protective guardians) of people and places, or in some traditions as dangerous, predatory beings, which for example would kidnap women to have as wives.

==Etymology and Pacific analogues==
Linguists have reconstructed the word &quot;taniwha&quot; to Proto-Oceanic *&quot;tanifa&quot;, with the meaning &quot;shark species&quot;. In Tongan and Niuean, &quot;tenifa&quot; refers to a large dangerous shark, as does the Samoan &quot;tanifa&quot;; the Tokelauan &quot;tanifa&quot; is a sea-monster that eats people. In most other Polynesian languages, the cognate words refer to sharks or simply fish. Some anthropologists have stated that the taniwha has &quot;analogues that appear within other Polynesian cosmologies&quot;.

==Characteristics==
At sea, a taniwha often appears as a whale or a large shark such as southern right whale or whale shark; compare the Māori name for the great white shark: &quot;mangō-taniwha&quot;. In inland waters, they may still be of whale-like dimensions, but look more like a gecko or a tuatara, having a row of spines along the back. Other taniwha appear as a floating log, which behaves in a disconcerting way (Orbell 1998:149–150, Reed 1963:297). Some can tunnel through the earth, uprooting trees in the process. Legends credit certain taniwha with creating harbours by carving out a channel to the ocean. Wellington&#x27;s harbour, Te Whanganui-a-Tara, was reputedly carved out by two taniwha. The petrified remains of one of them turned into a hill overlooking the city. Lake Waikaremoana in Te Urewera Ranges area of Wairoa District was also reputedly carved out by taniwha. Other taniwha allegedly caused landslides beside lakes or rivers.

Taniwha can either be male or female. The taniwha Āraiteuru is said to have arrived in New Zealand with the early voyaging canoes and her eleven sons are credited with creating the various branches of the Hokianga Harbour (Orbell 1995:184–185).

There has been some speculation based on several marine sightings and on purported habitat &amp; physical representations that the Taniwha myth may be based on periodic populations of Saltwater Crocodile which rarely end up crossing the strait from Australia. Northern New Zealand presently appears to be just outside the temperature range where a population can sustain itself indefinitely, dying out during unusually cold winters.

==As guardians==
Most taniwha have associations with tribal groups; each group may have a taniwha of its own. The taniwha Ureia, depicted on this page, was associated as a guardian with the Māori people of the Hauraki district. Many well-known taniwha arrived from Hawaiki, often as guardians of a particular ancestral canoe. Once arrived in Aotearoa, they took on a protective role over the descendants of the crew of the canoe they had accompanied. The origins of many other taniwha are unknown.

When accorded appropriate respect, taniwha usually acted well towards their people. Taniwha acted as guardians by warning of the approach of enemies, communicating the information via a priest who was a medium; sometimes the taniwha saved people from drowning. Because they lived in dangerous or dark and gloomy places, the people were careful to placate the taniwha with appropriate offerings if they needed to be in the vicinity or to pass by its lair. These offerings were often of a green twig, accompanied by a fitting incantation. In harvest time, the first kūmara (sweet potato) or the first taro was often presented to the taniwha.

Arising from the role of taniwha as tribal guardians, the word can also refer in a complimentary way to chiefs. The famous saying of the Tainui people of the Waikato district plays on this double meaning: &quot;Waikato taniwha rau&quot; (Waikato of a hundred chiefs) (Mead &amp; Groves 2001:421).

Witi Ihimaera, author of &quot;The Whale Rider&quot;, says that he has a female &quot;kaitiaki&quot; (guardian) taniwha named Hine Te Ariki who lives in the Waipāoa River.

==As notorious monsters==
In their role as guardians, taniwha were vigilant to ensure that the people respected the restrictions imposed by tapu. They made certain that any violations of tapu were punished. Taniwha were especially dangerous to people from other tribes. There are many legends of battles with taniwha, both on land and at sea. Often these conflicts took place soon after the settlement of New Zealand, generally after a taniwha had attacked and eaten a person from a tribe that it had no connection with. Always, the humans manage to outwit and defeat the taniwha. Many of these taniwha are described as beings of lizard-like form, and some of the stories say the huge beasts were cut up and eaten by the slayers. When Hotu-puku, a taniwha of the Rotorua district, was killed, his stomach was cut open to reveal a number of bodies of men, women, and children, whole and still undigested, as well as various body parts. The taniwha had swallowed all that his victims had been carrying, and his stomach also contained weapons of various kinds, darts, greenstone ornaments, shark&#x27;s teeth, flax clothing, and an assortment of fur and feather cloaks of the highest quality.

Many taniwha were killers but in this particular instance the taniwha Kaiwhare was eventually tamed by Tāmure. Tāmure lived at Hauraki and was understood to have a magical mere/pounamu with powers to defeat taniwha. The Manukau people then called for Tāmure to help kill the taniwha. Tāmure and Kaiwhare wrestled and Tāmure clubbed the taniwha over the head. Although he was unable to kill it, his actions tamed the taniwha. Kaiwhare still lives in the waters but now lives on kōura (crayfish) and wheke (octopus).

Ngārara Huarau is a taniwha known from the myths of several groups of Māori in the northern South Island. In most versions of the story, the monster eats several villagers and captures a young woman whom he keeps in a cave by the sea. Ngārara Huarau is eventually enticed to come to the local village for a feast, where he is ambushed and killed by the villagers. In each version of the story, upon his death the monster&#x27;s tail detaches itself and is thrown far away into a body of water. In the version of Wainui Bay, and the Tākaka Māori, the tail lands in the pool at the base of Wainui Falls.

==Relationships with people==
Sometimes, a person who had dealings with taniwha during their lifetime might turn into a taniwha after they died. This happened to Te Tahi-o-te-rangi, who had been a medium for the taniwha, and had been rescued at one time by one of the creatures. Tūheita, an early ancestor who drowned, became a taniwha despite the fact that he had no prior dealings with the mythical beasts. Sometimes relationships are formed between humans and taniwha. Hine-kōrako was a female taniwha who married a human man, and Pānia was a woman from the sea who married a human and gave birth to a taniwha (Orbell 1998:150).

In the legend &quot;The Taniwha of Kaipara&quot; three sisters went out to pick berries. One of the sisters was particularly beautiful. The taniwha caused havoc on their walk back and the sisters fled. The taniwha caught the sisters one by one, trying to capture the beautiful one. On succeeding, he then took her back to his cave. Many years passed and the woman bore the taniwha six sons, with three like their father and three fully human. She educated all her sons and in particular taught her human sons the art of war, helping them to fashion and use weapons. The human sons then killed their three taniwha brothers, and eventually their father. They all went back to their homes.

==Modern usage==
&quot;In more recent years, taniwha have featured prominently in New Zealand news broadcasts—due to taniwha spirits being referenced in both court cases and in various legal negotiations.&quot; Beliefs in the existence of taniwha have a potential for controversy but there has been a change in the way they are viewed; rather than being derided for holding up development and infrastructure projects they are becoming recognised as indicators of natural hazards.

In 2002, Ngāti Naho, a Māori tribe from the Meremere district, successfully ensured that part of the country&#x27;s major highway, State Highway 1, be rerouted in order to protect the abode of their legendary protector. This taniwha was said to have the appearance of large white eel, and Ngāti Naho argued that it must not be removed but rather move on of its own accord; to remove the taniwha would be to invite trouble. Television New Zealand reported in November 2002 that Transit New Zealand had negotiated a deal with Ngāti Naho under which &quot;concessions have been put in place to ensure that the taniwha are respected&quot;. Some like the journalist Brian Rudman have criticised such deals in respect of &#x27;secretive taniwha which rise up from swamps and river beds every now and again, demanding a tithe from Transit New Zealand&#x27;.

In 2001 &quot;another notable instance of taniwha featuring heavily within the public eye was that of a proposed Northland prison site at Ngawha which was eventually granted approval through the courts.&quot;

Māori academic Ranginui Walker said that in the modern age a taniwha was the manifestation of a coping mechanism for some Māori. It did not mean there actually was a creature lurking in the water, it was just their way of indicating they were troubled by some incident or event.

In 2010 there was an episode of &quot;Destination Truth&quot; where Josh Gates and his team went looking for the taniwha, but turned up no good evidence.

In 2021, the 28th Minister of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand Nanaia Mahuta characterised China–New Zealand relations as the relationship between a taniwha and a dragon.

==Similarities with other Polynesian cultures==
&quot;Moʻo&quot; or &quot;Moho&quot;, reptilian deities which can be seen in Hawaiian lore, strongly share characteristics with Taniwha as being both protector and harmful to men, shape-shifting, and so on.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Power Rangers Dino Charge&quot; episode &quot;Deep Down Under&quot; mentions the Taniwha myth but identifies it with such cryptids as the Loch Ness Monster.

In the song &quot;Dirty Creature&quot;, by New Zealand art rock group Split Enz, the Taniwha is described as rising from &quot;the river of dread&quot; and paralyzing its victims with &quot;tentacles on the brain&quot; that &quot;bind and gag [their] wits.&quot;

In the first episode of the second series of &quot;Wellington Paranormal&quot;, the police investigate missing fishermen around Wellington Harbour and encounter two taniwha.

Taniwha is a legendary creature in the trading card game Magic: The Gathering.

In 1874, the mosasaur &quot;Taniwhasaurus&quot;, first discovered in New Zealand, was named for the Taniwha.

In the movie &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, the character Grace Heke can be seen telling her siblings a story about Taniwha outside the family home.

<doc id="60004" wikidata="Q957543" url="?curid=60004" title="Ernest Shackleton">
<text>Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton (15 February 1874 – 5 January 1922) was an Anglo-Irish Antarctic explorer who led three British expeditions to the Antarctic. He was one of the principal figures of the period known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.

Born in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland, Shackleton and his Anglo-Irish family moved to Sydenham in suburban south London when he was ten. Shackleton&#x27;s first experience of the polar regions was as third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition of 1901–1904, from which he was sent home early on health grounds, after he and his companions Scott and Edward Adrian Wilson set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S. During the &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition of 1907–1909, he and three companions established a new record Farthest South latitude of 88°23′ S, only 97 geographical miles (112 statute miles or 180 kilometres) from the South Pole, the largest advance to the pole in exploration history. Also, members of his team climbed Mount Erebus, the most active Antarctic volcano. On returning home, Shackleton was knighted for his achievements by King Edward VII.

After the race to the South Pole ended in December 1911, with Roald Amundsen&#x27;s conquest, Shackleton turned his attention to the crossing of Antarctica from sea to sea, via the pole. To this end, he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. The expedition was struck by disaster when its ship, , became trapped in pack ice and finally sank in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica on 21 November 1915. The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately the South Atlantic island of South Georgia, enduring a stormy ocean voyage of in Shackleton&#x27;s most famous exploit. He returned to the Antarctic with the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition in 1921 but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in South Georgia. At his wife&#x27;s request, he remained on the island and was buried in Grytviken cemetery. The wreck of &quot;Endurance&quot; was discovered just over a century after Shackleton&#x27;s death.

Away from his expeditions, Shackleton&#x27;s life was generally restless and unfulfilled. In his search for rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was &quot;rediscovered&quot;, and he became a role model for leadership in extreme circumstances. In his 1956 address to the British Science Association, one of Shackleton&#x27;s contemporaries, Sir Raymond Priestley, said: &quot;Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency[,] but[,] when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton&quot;, paraphrasing what Apsley Cherry-Garrard had written in a preface to his 1922 memoir &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;. In 2002, Shackleton was voted eleventh in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

== Early years ==

=== Childhood and education ===

Shackleton was born on 15 February 1874, in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland. His father, Henry Shackleton, tried to enter the British Army, but his poor health prevented him from doing so; instead he became a farmer and settled in Kilkea. The Shackleton family are of English origin, specifically from West Yorkshire. Shackleton&#x27;s father was descended from Abraham Shackleton, an English Quaker who moved to Ireland in 1726 and started a school in Ballitore, County Kildare. Shackleton&#x27;s mother, Henrietta Letitia Sophia Gavan, was descended from the Fitzmaurice family. Ernest was the second of ten children and the first of two sons; the second, Frank, achieved notoriety as a suspect, later exonerated, in the 1907 theft of the so-called Irish Crown Jewels, which have never been recovered.

In 1880, when Ernest was six, his father gave up his life as a landowner to study medicine at Trinity College Dublin, moving his family to the city. Four years later, they left Ireland and moved to Sydenham in suburban London. This was partly in search of better professional prospects for the newly qualified doctor, but another factor may have been unease about the family&#x27;s Anglo-Irish ancestry, following the 1882 assassination by Irish nationalists of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the British Chief Secretary for Ireland. However, Shackleton took lifelong pride in his Irish roots and frequently declared that he was &quot;an Irishman&quot;.

From early childhood, Shackleton was a voracious reader, a pursuit which sparked in him a passion for adventure. He was schooled by a governess until the age of eleven, when he began at Fir Lodge Preparatory School in West Hill, Dulwich, in southeast London. At the age of thirteen, he entered Dulwich College. As a youngster, Shackleton did not particularly distinguish himself as a scholar, and was said to be &quot;bored&quot; by his studies.

He was quoted later as saying: &quot;I never learned much geography at school [...] Literature, too, consisted in the dissection, the parsing, the analysing of certain passages from our great poets and prose-writers ... teachers should be very careful not to spoil [their pupils&#x27;] taste for poetry for all time by making it a task and an imposition.&quot; In his final term at the school, he was still able to achieve fifth place in his class of thirty-one.
=== Merchant Navy officer ===

Shackleton&#x27;s restlessness at school was such that he was allowed to leave at sixteen and go to sea. One option was a Royal Navy officer cadetship in the at Dartmouth, but this was too expensive, and Shackleton passed the upper age limit of fourteen and a half in 1888. Alternatives were the mercantile marine cadet ships &quot;Worcester&quot; and , or an apprenticeship &quot;before the mast&quot; on a sailing vessel. This third option was chosen. His father was able to secure him a berth with the North Western Shipping Company, aboard the square-rigged sailing ship &quot;Hoghton Tower&quot;.

Over the next four years at sea, Shackleton learned his trade and visited many parts of the world, forming a variety of acquaintances and learning to associate with people from many different walks of life. In August 1894, he passed his examination for second mate and accepted a post as third officer on a tramp steamer of the Welsh Shire Line. Two years later, he had obtained his first mate&#x27;s ticket, and in 1898, he was certified as a master mariner, qualifying him to command a British ship anywhere in the world.

In 1898, he joined Union-Castle Line, the regular mail and passenger carrier between Britain and South Africa. One of his shipmates recorded that Shackleton was &quot;a departure from our usual type of young officer&quot;, content with his own company though not aloof, &quot;spouting lines from Keats or Browning&quot;, a mixture of sensitivity and aggression but not unsympathetic. Following the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, Shackleton transferred to the troopship &quot;Tintagel Castle&quot; where, in March 1900, he met Cedric Longstaff, an army lieutenant whose father Llewellyn W. Longstaff was the main financial backer of the British National Antarctic Expedition then being organised in London.

Shackleton used his acquaintance with the son to obtain an interview with Longstaff senior, with a view to obtaining a place on the expedition. Impressed by Shackleton&#x27;s keenness, Longstaff recommended him to Sir Clements Markham, the expedition&#x27;s overlord, making it clear that he wanted Shackleton accepted. On 17 February 1901, his appointment as third officer to the expedition&#x27;s ship was confirmed; on 4 June he was commissioned into the Royal Navy, with the rank of sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve. Although officially on leave from Union-Castle, this was in fact the end of Shackleton&#x27;s Merchant Navy service.

== &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition, 1901–1903 ==
The British National Antarctic Expedition—known as the &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition after the ship &quot;Discovery&quot;—was the brainchild of Sir Clements Markham, president of the Royal Geographical Society, and had been many years in preparation. Led by Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy torpedo lieutenant lately promoted commander, the expedition had objectives that included scientific and geographical discovery.

Although &quot;Discovery&quot; was not a Royal Navy unit, Scott required the crew, officers and scientific staff to submit to the conditions of the Naval Discipline Act, meaning that the ship and expedition were run on Royal Navy lines. Shackleton accepted this approach, even though his own background and instincts favoured a different, more informal style of leadership. His particular duties were listed as: &quot;In charge of sea-water analysis. Ward-room caterer. In charge of the holds, stores, and provisions [...] He also arranges the entertainments.&quot;

&quot;Discovery&quot; departed from London&#x27;s East India Docks on 31 July 1901, arriving at the Antarctic coast, via Madeira, Cape Town and New Zealand, on 9 January 1902. After landing, Shackleton took part in an experimental balloon flight on 4 February. He also participated, with the scientists Edward A. Wilson and Hartley T. Ferrar, in the first sledging trip from the expedition&#x27;s winter quarters in McMurdo Sound, a journey which established a safe route on to the Great Ice Barrier. Confined to the iced-in &quot;Discovery&quot; throughout the Antarctic winter of 1902, Shackleton edited the expedition&#x27;s magazine the &quot;South Polar Times&quot;, a regular publication that kept everyone onboard entertained. According to steward Clarence Hare, Shackleton was &quot;the most popular of the officers among the crew, being a good mixer&quot;, though claims that this represented an unofficial rivalry to Scott&#x27;s leadership are unsupported.

Scott chose Shackleton to accompany Wilson and himself on the expedition&#x27;s southern journey, a march southwards to achieve the highest possible latitude in the direction of the South Pole. This was not a serious attempt on the Pole, although the attainment of a high latitude was of great importance to Scott, and the inclusion of Shackleton indicated a high degree of personal trust. The party set out on 2 November 1902. Scott later wrote that the march was &quot;a combination of success and failure&quot;. They reached a record Farthest South latitude of 82°17′ S, beating the previous record established in 1900 by Carsten Borchgrevink.

The journey was marred by the poor performance of the dogs, who rapidly fell sick after their food had become tainted. All 22 dogs died during the march. The three men all suffered at times from snow blindness, frostbite and, ultimately, scurvy. On the return journey, Shackleton had by his own admission &quot;broken down&quot; and could no longer carry out his share of the work. He later denied Scott&#x27;s claim in &quot;The Voyage of the Discovery&quot;, that he had been carried on the sledge. He was in a severely weakened condition; Wilson&#x27;s diary entry for 14 January 1903 reads: &quot;Shackleton has been anything but up to the mark, and today he is decidedly worse, very short-winded, and coughing constantly, with more serious symptoms which need not be detailed here, but which are of no small consequence a hundred and sixty miles from the ship, and full loads to pull all the way.&quot;

The party finally arrived back at the ship on 3 February 1903. After a medical examination that proved inconclusive, Scott decided to send Shackleton home on the relief ship , which had arrived in McMurdo Sound in January. Scott wrote: &quot;He ought not to risk further hardships in his present state of health.&quot; There is conjecture that Scott&#x27;s motive for removing him was resentment of Shackleton&#x27;s popularity, and that ill-health was used as an excuse to get rid of him.

Years after the deaths of Scott, Wilson and Shackleton, the expedition&#x27;s second-in-command Albert Armitage claimed that there had been a falling-out on the southern journey, and that Scott had told the ship&#x27;s doctor that &quot;[if] he does not go back sick he will go back in disgrace&quot;. There is no corroboration of Armitage&#x27;s story. Shackleton and Scott remained on friendly terms, at least until the publication of Scott&#x27;s account of the southern journey in &quot;The Voyage of the Discovery&quot;. While in public they appeared mutually respectful and cordial, according to biographer Roland Huntford, Shackleton&#x27;s attitude to Scott turned to &quot;smouldering scorn and dislike&quot;; salvage of wounded pride required &quot;a return to the Antarctic and an attempt to outdo Scott&quot;.

== Shore work, 1903–1907 ==

After a period of convalescence in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York. As the first significant person to return from the Antarctic, he found that he was in demand; in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of &quot;Discovery&quot;. With Sir Clements Markham&#x27;s blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the outfitting of the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; for the second &quot;Discovery&quot; relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer. He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentine , which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenskjöld.

In search of more permanent employment in 1903, Shackleton applied for a regular commission in the Royal Navy via the back-door route of the Supplementary List. Despite the sponsorship of Markham and William Huggins, the president of the Royal Society, his application was unsuccessful because the list was closed. The Admiralty suggested that he could be promoted to Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve if he qualified, but he chose to resign his RNR commission the following year. Instead, he became a journalist, working for the &quot;Royal Magazine&quot;, but he found this unsatisfactory. He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), a post which he took up on 11 January 1904. Three months later, on 9 April, he married Emily Dorman, with whom he had three children: Raymond, Cecily, and Edward, himself an explorer and later a politician.

In 1905, Shackleton became a shareholder in a speculative company that aimed to make a fortune transporting Russian troops home from the Far East. Despite his assurances to Emily that &quot;we are practically sure of the contract&quot;, nothing came of this scheme. He also ventured into politics, unsuccessfully standing in the 1906 General Election as the Liberal Unionist Party&#x27;s candidate for Dundee constituency in opposition to Irish Home Rule. In the meantime, he had taken a job with wealthy Clydeside industrialist William Beardmore (later Lord Invernairn), with a roving commission which involved interviewing prospective clients and entertaining Beardmore&#x27;s business friends. He was, by this time, making no secret of his ambition to return to Antarctica at the head of his own expedition.

Beardmore was sufficiently impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support, but other donations proved hard to come by. Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton presented to the Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, were published in the RGS newsletter, &quot;Geographical Journal&quot;. The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. He then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (equivalent to £ in ) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship &quot;Nimrod&quot;.

On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of lieutenant).

== &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition, 1907–1909 ==
On 7 August 1907, the set sail from England for the start of the British Antarctic Expedition, reaching New Zealand at the end of November. After some final preparations, the expedition set off from Lyttelton Harbour on 1 January 1908, heading for the Antarctic. Shackleton had originally planned to use the old &quot;Discovery&quot; base in McMurdo Sound to launch his attempts on the South Pole and South Magnetic Pole, but before leaving England, he had been pressured into giving Scott an undertaking not to base himself in the McMurdo area, which Scott was claiming as his own field of work. Shackleton reluctantly agreed to seek out winter quarters at either the Barrier Inlet—which he had briefly visited in 1902 on &quot;Discovery&quot;—or King Edward VII Land.

To conserve coal, the ship was towed by the steamer &quot;Koonya&quot; to the Antarctic ice, after Shackleton had persuaded the New Zealand government and the Union Steamship Company to share the cost. In accordance with Shackleton&#x27;s promise to Scott, the ship headed for the eastern sector of the Great Ice Barrier, arriving there on 21 January 1908. They discovered that the Barrier Inlet had expanded to form a large bay, containing hundreds of whales, and they immediately christened it the &quot;Bay of Whales&quot;.

The ice conditions were found to be unstable, making it impossible to establish a safe base at the Barrier Inlet, and an extended search for an anchorage at King Edward VII Land proved equally futile. Shackleton was forced to break the undertaking he had made to Scott, and the &quot;Nimrod&quot; set sail for McMurdo Sound; according to second officer Arthur Harbord, this decision was &quot;dictated by common sense&quot; in view of the difficulties of ice pressure, coal shortage and the lack of any alternative base known to be close at hand. The ship arrived at McMurdo Sound on 29 January, but was stopped by ice north of &quot;Discovery&quot;″s old base at Hut Point. After considerable weather delays, a base was eventually established at Cape Royds, about north of Hut Point. The party was in high spirits, despite the difficult conditions; Shackleton&#x27;s ability to bond with his crew kept the party happy and focused.

On 29 October 1908, Shackleton and three companions—Frank Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams—set off on the &quot;Great Southern Journey&quot;, as Wild called it. On 9 January 1909, they reached a new Farthest South latitude of 88°23′ S, a point from the Pole. En route, the South Pole party discovered the Beardmore Glacier, named after Shackleton&#x27;s patron, and the four men became the first persons to see and travel on the South Polar Plateau. Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race to avoid starvation, and they were restricted to half-rations for much of the duration. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: &quot;All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me&quot;. The party arrived back at Hut Point just in time to catch the ship.

The other main accomplishments of the British Antarctic Expedition included the first ascent of Mount Erebus, and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole, attained by Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay on 16 January 1909. Shackleton returned to the United Kingdom as a hero, and soon afterwards published his account of the expedition, &quot;The Heart of the Antarctic&quot;. His wife Emily later recorded: &quot;The only comment he made to me about not reaching the Pole, was &#x27;a live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27; and I said &#x27;Yes darling, as far as I am concerned,&#x27; and we left it at that.&quot;

In 1910, Shackleton made a series of three recordings using an Edison phonograph, in which he briefly described the expedition. In 2010, several (mostly intact) cases of whisky and brandy that had been left behind in 1909 were recovered for analysis by a distilling company. A revival of the vintage formula for the particular brands found was offered for sale, with a portion of the proceeds donated to the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust which had discovered the lost spirits.

== Between expeditions, 1909–1914 ==
=== Public hero ===

On Shackleton&#x27;s return home, public honours were quickly forthcoming. He was received by King Edward VII on 10 July 1909, and raised to a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. He received a knighthood in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours list in November, becoming &quot;Sir Ernest Shackleton&quot;. The RGS awarded him a gold medal; a proposal to present him with a smaller medal than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on. Each member of the &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition shore party received a silver Polar Medal on 23 November, Shackleton himself receiving a clasp to attach to his earlier medal. He was also appointed a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a significant honour for British mariners.

Besides the official honours bestowed on Shackleton, his Antarctic feats were greeted in Britain with great enthusiasm. Proposing a toast to Shackleton at a lunch given in his honour by the Royal Societies Club, Lord Halsbury, a former Lord Chancellor, said: &quot;When one remembers what he had gone through, one does not believe in the supposed degeneration of the British race. One does not believe that we have lost all sense of admiration for courage [and] endurance&quot;. The heroism was also claimed by Ireland: the Dublin &quot;Evening Telegraph&#x27;s&quot; headline read &quot;South Pole Almost Reached by an Irishman&quot;, while the &quot;Dublin Express&quot; spoke of the &quot;qualities which were his heritage as an Irishman&quot;.

Shackleton&#x27;s fellow polar explorers expressed their admiration; Roald Amundsen wrote, in a letter to RGS Secretary John Scott Keltie, that &quot;the English nation has by this deed of Shackleton&#x27;s won a victory [...] which never can be surpassed.&quot; Fridtjof Nansen sent an effusive private letter to Shackleton&#x27;s wife, praising the &quot;unique expedition, which has been such a complete success in every respect.&quot; The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, in the form of a grant of £20,000 (equivalent to £ in ) to clear the most pressing obligations, and it is likely that many of his debts were written off.

=== Biding time ===

In the period immediately after his return, Shackleton engaged in a strenuous schedule of public appearances, lectures and social engagements. He then sought to cash in on his celebrity by making a fortune in the world of business. Among the ventures that he hoped to promote were a tobacco company, a scheme for selling special postage stamps to collectors—overprinted &quot;King Edward VII Land&quot;, based on his appointment as Antarctic postmaster by the New Zealand authorities—and the development of a Hungarian mining concession he had acquired near the city of Nagybanya, now part of Romania.

As none of these enterprises prospered, Shackleton&#x27;s main source of income was his earnings from lecture tours. He still harboured thoughts of returning south, even though in September 1910, having recently moved with his family to Sheringham in Norfolk, he wrote to Emily: &quot;I am never again going South and I have thought it all out and my place is at home now.&quot; He had been in discussions with Douglas Mawson about a scientific expedition to the Antarctic coast between Cape Adare and Gaussberg, and had written to the RGS about this in February 1910.

Any future resumption by Shackleton of his quest for the South Pole depended on the results of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition, which had sailed from Cardiff on 15 June 1910. By early 1912, the world was aware that the pole had been conquered by the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, but the fate of Scott&#x27;s expedition was not then known. Shackleton&#x27;s mind turned to a project that had been announced, and then abandoned, by the British explorer William Speirs Bruce, for a continental crossing via the South Pole, starting from a landing point in the Weddell Sea and ending in McMurdo Sound. Bruce had failed to acquire financial backing, and was happy for Shackleton to adopt his plans, which were similar to those being followed by the German explorer Wilhelm Filchner who had left Bremerhaven in May 1911; in December 1912, the news arrived from South Georgia that Filchner&#x27;s expedition had failed. In Shackleton&#x27;s own words, the transcontinental journey was the &quot;one great main object of Antarctic journeyings&quot; remaining, and now open to him.

== Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–1917 ==

=== Preparations ===
In December 1913, Shackleton published details of his new expedition, grandly titled the &quot;Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition&quot;. There is a legend that Shackleton posted an advertisement emphasising the hardship and danger of the planned voyage, so that he could better narrow down the selection of candidates for his expedition, but no record of any such advertisement has survived and its existence is considered doubtful. Two ships were to be employed: &quot;Endurance&quot; would carry the main party into the Weddell Sea, aiming for Vahsel Bay from where a team of six, led by Shackleton, would begin the crossing of the continent; meanwhile, a second ship, the &quot;Aurora&quot;, would take a supporting party under Captain Aeneas Mackintosh to McMurdo Sound on the far side of the continent. This party would be tasked with laying supply depots across the Great Ice Barrier as far as the Beardmore Glacier, the depots holding the food and fuel required to enable Shackleton&#x27;s party to complete their journey of across the continent.

Shackleton used his considerable fund-raising skills to support the expedition, which was financed largely by private donations, although the British government gave £10,000 (equivalent to £ in ). Scottish jute magnate Sir James Caird donated £24,000, Midlands industrialist Frank Dudley Docker gave £10,000, and tobacco heiress Janet Stancomb-Wills gave an undisclosed but reportedly &quot;generous&quot; sum. There was considerable public interest; Shackleton received more than 5,000 applications to join his expedition.

At times, his interviewing and selection methods seemed eccentric; believing that character and temperament were as important as technical ability, his questions were unconventional. Physicist Reginald James was asked if he could sing; others were accepted on sight because Shackleton liked the look of them, or after the briefest of interrogations. He loosened some of the traditional hierarchies to promote camaraderie, such as distributing the ship&#x27;s chores equally among officers, scientists and able seamen. He made a point of socialising with his crew members every evening after dinner, leading sing-alongs, jokes and games. He finally selected a crew of fifty-six; shared equally, twenty-eight men on each ship.

Despite the outbreak of the First World War on 3 August 1914, &quot;Endurance&quot; was directed by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to &quot;proceed&quot;, and left British waters on 8 August. Shackleton delayed his own departure until 27 September, meeting the ship in Buenos Aires. On setting sail for South Georgia at the end of October, he sent a cablegram to the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;, conveying the patriotic message: &quot;We hope in our small way to add victories in science and discovery to that certain victory which our nation will achieve in the cause of honor and liberty.&quot;

=== Crew ===
While Shackleton led the expedition, Captain Frank Worsley commanded the &quot;Endurance&quot; and Captain Aeneas Mackintosh the &quot;Aurora&quot;. On the &quot;Endurance&quot;, the second-in-command was the experienced explorer Frank Wild, and the first officer was Lionel Greenstreet. The meteorologist was Leonard Hussey, who was also an able banjo player. Surgeon James McIlroy was head of the scientific staff, which included geologist James Wordie. Alexander Macklin was the second of the two surgeons, also in charge of keeping the 70 dogs healthy. Tom Crean was in more immediate charge as head dog-handler. Other crew included navigator Hubert Hudson, physicist Reginald James, a carpenter Harry McNish, and a biologist named Robert Clark.

Of later independent fame was the expedition&#x27;s official photographer Frank Hurley, known on this mission for his perilous shots. Perce Blackborow was a nineteen-year-old Welsh sailor who had stowed away on the ship after being refused a job; although angered by this, Shackleton realised it was too late to turn back by the time the situation was discovered, so Blackborow was allowed to join the crew and assigned to the ship&#x27;s galley.

There was a (male) cat on board, named Mrs Chippy, that belonged to the carpenter Harry McNish. Mrs Chippy was shot when the &quot;Endurance&quot; sank, due to the belief that he would not have survived the ordeal that followed.

=== Loss of &quot;Endurance&quot; ===
&quot;Endurance&quot; departed from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December 1914, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, she encountered first-year ice, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, &quot;Endurance&quot; became frozen fast in an ice floe.

On 24 February, realising that they would be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of the ship&#x27;s routine and her conversion to a winter station. &quot;Endurance&quot; drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of the ice and its later movements put extreme pressure on the ship&#x27;s hull.
Shackleton had been hoping that the ship, when released from the ice, could work her way back towards Vahsel Bay, but his hopes were dashed on 24 October when water began pouring in. After a few days, with the position at 69°5′ S, 51°30′ W, he gave the order to abandon ship, saying, &quot;She&#x27;s going down!&quot;; and men, provisions and equipment were transferred to camps on the ice. On 21 November 1915, the wreck of &quot;Endurance&quot; finally slipped beneath the surface.

For almost two months, Shackleton and his party camped on a large, flat floe, hoping that it would drift towards Paulet Island, approximately away, where it was known that stores were cached. After failed attempts to march across the ice to this island, Shackleton decided to set up another more permanent camp (Patience Camp) on another floe, and trust to the drift of the ice to take them towards a safe landing. By 17 March, their ice camp was within of Paulet Island; however, separated by impassable ice, they were unable to reach it. On 9 April, their ice floe broke into two, and Shackleton ordered the crew into the lifeboats and to head for the nearest land.

After five harrowing days at sea, the exhausted men landed their three lifeboats at Elephant Island, from where the &quot;Endurance&quot; had sunk. This was the first time they had set foot on solid ground for 497 days. Shackleton&#x27;s concern for his men was such that he gave his mittens to photographer Frank Hurley, who had lost his own mittens during the boat journey. Shackleton suffered frostbitten fingers as a result.

=== Open-boat journey ===

Elephant Island was an inhospitable place, far from any shipping routes. Rescue by means of a chance discovery was very unlikely, so Shackleton decided to risk an open-boat journey to the South Georgia whaling stations where he knew help would be available. The strongest of the tiny lifeboats, christened after the expedition&#x27;s chief sponsor, was chosen for the trip. Ship&#x27;s carpenter Harry McNish made various improvements, which included raising the sides, strengthening the keel, building a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, and sealing the work with oil paint and seal blood.

Shackleton chose five companions for the journey: the ship&#x27;s captain Frank Worsley, who would be responsible for navigation; Tom Crean, who had &quot;begged to go&quot;; two strong sailors in John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy; and McNish. The carpenter had earlier clashed with Shackleton when the party was stranded on the ice but, while not forgetting his earlier insubordination, Shackleton recognised McNish&#x27;s value for this particular job.

Shackleton insisted on packing only enough supplies to last for four weeks, knowing that if they failed to reach South Georgia within that time, the boat and its crew would be lost. The &quot;James Caird&quot; was launched on 24 April 1916; during the next fifteen days, it sailed through the waters of the southern ocean, at the mercy of the stormy seas and in peril of capsizing. Thanks to Worsley&#x27;s navigational skills, the cliffs of South Georgia came into sight on 8 May, but hurricane-force winds prevented any possibility of landing. The party was forced to ride out the storm offshore, in continual danger of being dashed against the rocks. They later learned that the same storm had sunk a 500-ton steamer bound for South Georgia from Buenos Aires.

The next day, they were able to land on the unoccupied southern shore, and a period of rest and recuperation followed. Rather than risking another sea journey to reach the whaling stations on the northern coast, Shackleton decided to attempt a land crossing of the island. Although it is likely that Norwegian whalers had already crossed the island at other points on ski, no one had previously attempted this particular route. For their journey, the men were only equipped with boots they had adapted for climbing by pushing screws into the soles, a carpenter&#x27;s adze, and of rope. Leaving McNish, Vincent and McCarthy at the landing point on South Georgia, Shackleton travelled with Worsley and Crean over of dangerous mountainous terrain for 36 hours, reaching the whaling station at Stromness on 20 May.

=== Rescue ===

Shackleton immediately sent a boat to pick up the three men from the other side of South Georgia Island, while he set to work organising the rescue of those left behind on Elephant Island. His first three attempts were foiled by sea ice, which blocked the approaches to the island. He appealed to the Chilean government and was offered the use of the , a small seagoing tug from the Chilean Navy. &quot;Yelcho&quot;, commanded by Captain Luis Pardo, and the British whaler &quot;Southern Sky&quot;, reached Elephant Island on 30 August 1916, at which point the men had been isolated there for four and a half months. Shackleton quickly evacuated all 22 men. The party was taken on &quot;Yelcho&quot; first to Punta Arenas and after some days to Valparaíso in Chile, where crowds warmly welcomed them back to civilisation.

At the same time that the &quot;Endurance&quot; was suffering these perils, the &quot;Aurora&quot; (the expedition supporting component) also suffered misfortune. The remaining men of the Ross Sea party had been stranded at Cape Evans in McMurdo Sound when the &quot;Aurora&quot; was blown from its anchorage and driven out to sea, unable to return. After a drift of many months, the ship had returned to New Zealand. Shackleton travelled there to join &quot;Aurora&quot;, and sailed with her to rescue the Ross Sea party which, despite many hardships, had successfully completed its depot-laying mission. However, three lives had been lost, including that of its commander Aeneas Mackintosh.

== First World War ==
Europe was in the midst of the First World War when Shackleton returned to England in May 1917. Suffering from a heart condition, made worse by the fatigue of his arduous journeys, and too old to be conscripted, he nevertheless volunteered for the British Army. He repeatedly requested posting to the front in France, and was by now drinking heavily.

In October 1917, Shackleton was sent to Buenos Aires to boost British propaganda in South America. Unqualified as a diplomat, he was unsuccessful in persuading Argentina and Chile to enter the war on the Allied side, and he returned home in April 1918. He was then briefly involved in a mission to Spitzbergen, to establish a British presence there under the guise of a mining operation. On the way, he was taken ill in Tromsø, possibly with a heart attack. He was then appointed to a military expedition to Murmansk, which obliged him to return home again before departing for northern Russia.

== Russian Civil War ==
Shackleton was specially appointed a temporary major on 22 July 1918. From October 1918, he served with the North Russia Expeditionary Force in the Russian Civil War under the command of Major-General Edmund Ironside, with the role of advising on the equipment and training of British forces in arctic conditions.

For his &quot;valuable services rendered in connection with Military Operations in North Russia&quot;, Shackleton was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, and he was also mentioned in despatches by General Ironside. Returning to England in early March 1919, he was full of plans for the economic development of Northern Russia. In the midst of seeking capital, his plans foundered when Northern Russia fell to Bolshevik control. Shackleton was finally discharged from the army in October 1919, retaining his rank of major.

== Final expedition and death ==
Shackleton returned to the lecture circuit and in December 1919 he published his own account of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, titled &quot;South&quot;. In 1920, tired of public speaking, he began to consider the possibility of a last expedition. He thought seriously of going to the Beaufort Sea area of the Arctic, a largely unexplored region, and raised some interest in this idea from the Canadian government. With funds supplied by former schoolfriend John Quiller Rowett, Shackleton acquired a 125-ton Norwegian sealer, named &quot;Foca I&quot;, which he renamed .

The plan changed; the destination became the Antarctic, and the project was defined by Shackleton as an &quot;oceanographic and sub-antarctic-expedition&quot;. The goals of the venture were imprecise, but a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and investigation of some &quot;lost&quot; sub-Antarctic islands, such as Tuanaki, were mentioned as objectives. Rowett agreed to finance the entire expedition, which became known as the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition.

On 16 September 1921, Shackleton recorded a farewell address on a sound-on-film system created by Harry Grindell Matthews, who claimed it was the first &quot;talking picture&quot; ever made. The expedition left England on 24 September 1921. Although some of Shackleton&#x27;s former crew members had not received all of their pay from the &quot;Endurance&quot; expedition, many of them signed on with their erstwhile &quot;Boss&quot;.

When the party arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Shackleton suffered a suspected heart attack. He refused to have a proper medical examination, and &quot;Quest&quot; continued south, arriving at South Georgia on 4 January 1922. In the early hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition&#x27;s physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin complaining of back pains and other discomfort. According to Macklin&#x27;s own account, he told Shackleton that he had been overdoing things and should try to &quot;lead a more regular life&quot;, to which Shackleton answered: &quot;You are always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?&quot; Macklin replied: &quot;Chiefly alcohol, Boss.&quot; A few moments later, at 2:50 a.m. on 5 January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.

After carrying out the post-mortem, Macklin concluded that the cause of death was atheroma of the coronary arteries exacerbated by &quot;overstrain during a period of debility&quot;. Contemporary study of diaries kept by Eric Marshall, medical officer to the 19071909 expedition, suggests that Shackleton suffered from an atrial septal defect (&quot;hole in the heart&quot;), a congenital heart defect, which may have been a cause of his health problems.

Leonard Hussey, a veteran of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, offered to accompany Shackleton&#x27;s body back to Britain, but while he was in Montevideo en route to England, a message was received from Emily Shackleton asking that her husband be buried in South Georgia. Hussey returned to South Georgia with the body on the steamer , and on 5 March 1922, Shackleton was buried in the Grytviken cemetery, after a short service in the Lutheran church, with Edward Binnie officiating. Macklin wrote in his diary: &quot;I think this is as the boss would have had it himself, standing lonely on an island far from civilization, surrounded by a stormy tempestuous sea, and in the vicinity of one of his greatest exploits.&quot;

Shackleton&#x27;s will was proven in London on 12 May 1922. He died heavily in debt, his small estate consisting of personal effects to the value of £556 (equivalent to £ in ). Lady Shackleton died in 1936, having survived her husband by fourteen years.

On 27 November 2011, the ashes of Frank Wild were interred on the right-hand side of Shackleton&#x27;s gravesite in Grytviken. The inscription on the rough-hewn granite block set to mark the spot reads: &quot;Frank Wild 1873–1939, Shackleton&#x27;s right-hand man.&quot;

In June 2024, wreck hunters found &quot;Quest&quot;, the vessel on which Shackleton made his final voyage. She was found on the seafloor off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada by a team led by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS). The ship was found &quot;intact&quot; lying at a depth of .

== Legacy ==
=== Early ===

Before the return of Shackleton&#x27;s body to South Georgia, a memorial service with full military honours took place at Holy Trinity Church, Montevideo, and a service was held on 2 March 1922 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, at which King George V and other members of the royal family were represented. Within a year, the first biography was published: &quot;The Life of Sir Ernest Shackleton&quot; by Hugh Robert Mill. As well as being a tribute to the explorer, this book was a practical effort to assist his family; Shackleton had died some £40,000 in debt (equivalent to £ in ). A further initiative was the formation of a Shackleton Memorial Fund, which was used to assist with his children&#x27;s education and to support his mother.

Shackleton&#x27;s death marked the end of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, a period of discovery characterised by journeys of geographical and scientific exploration in a largely unknown continent without any of the benefits of modern travel methods or radio communication. None of his voyages achieved its primary objective; over the ensuing decades, Shackleton&#x27;s status as a polar hero was generally outshone by that of Scott, whose polar party had by 1925 been commemorated on more than thirty monuments in Britain alone, including stained glass windows, statues, busts and memorial tablets. A statue of Shackleton designed by Charles Sargeant Jagger was unveiled at the Kensington headquarters of the RGS in 1932, but public memorials to him were relatively few. The printed word gave much more attention to Scott—a forty-page booklet titled &quot;Shackleton in the Antarctic&quot;, published in 1943 by OUP as part of a &quot;Great Exploits&quot; series, is described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as &quot;a lone example of a popular literary treatment of Shackleton in a sea of similar treatments of Scott&quot;. This disparity continued into the 1950s.

In the preface to his 1922 book &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;, Apsley Cherry-Garrard (who had accompanied Scott on the Terra Nova Expedition) wrote: &quot;For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen: and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time.&quot; This statement was paraphrased by one of Shackleton&#x27;s contemporaries, Sir Raymond Priestley, in his 1956 address to the British Science Association, thus: &quot;Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton.&quot;

=== Later ===
In April 1959, Alfred Lansing&#x27;s &quot;Endurance: Shackleton&#x27;s Incredible Voyage&quot; was published. This was the first of a number of books about Shackleton that began to appear, showing him in a highly positive light. At the same time, attitudes towards Scott were gradually changing as a more critical note was sounded in the literature, culminating in Roland Huntford&#x27;s 1979 treatment of him in his dual biography &quot;Scott and Amundsen&quot;, described by Barczewski as a &quot;devastating attack&quot;. This negative picture of Scott became accepted as the popular truth, as the kind of heroism that he represented fell victim to the cultural shifts of the late twentieth century. Within a few years, Scott was thoroughly overtaken in public esteem by Shackleton, whose popularity surged while that of his erstwhile rival declined. In 2002, in a BBC poll conducted to determine the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot;, Shackleton was ranked 11th while Scott was down in 54th place.

Margaret Morrell and Stephanie Capparell presented Shackleton as a model for corporate leadership in their 2001 book &quot;Shackleton&#x27;s Way: Leadership Lessons from the Great Antarctic Explorer&quot;. They wrote: &quot;Shackleton resonates with executives in today&#x27;s business world. His people-centred approach to leadership can be a guide to anyone in a position of authority&quot;. Other management writers soon followed this lead, using Shackleton as an exemplar for bringing order from chaos. Nancy Koehn argued that, in spite of Shackleton&#x27;s mistakes, financial problems and narcissism, he developed the capability to be successful.

The Centre for Leadership Studies at the University of Exeter offers a course on Shackleton, which also features in the management education programmes of several American universities. In Boston, a &quot;Shackleton School&quot; was set up on &quot;Outward Bound&quot; principles, with the motto &quot;The Journey is Everything&quot;. Shackleton has also been cited as a model leader by the US Navy, and in a textbook on Congressional leadership, Peter L. Steinke calls Shackleton the archetype of the &quot;nonanxious leader&quot; whose &quot;calm, reflective demeanor becomes the antibiotic warning of the toxicity of reactive behaviour&quot;. In 2001, the Athy Heritage Centre-Museum (now the Shackleton Museum), Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, established the Ernest Shackleton Autumn School, which is held annually, to honour the memory of Ernest Shackleton.
In 1983, the BBC produced a four-part miniseries, &quot;Shackleton&quot;, starring David Schofield in the title role and David Rodigan as Frank Wild. Originally broadcast on BBC Two, the series was released on DVD in March 2017. Shackleton also appeared in the first episode of the 1985 Central Television serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;, in which he was portrayed by James Aubrey.

In 1993, Trevor Potts re-enacted the Boat Journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia in honour of Sir Ernest Shackleton, totally unsupported, in a replica of the &quot;James Caird&quot;.

A photography exhibition titled &quot;The Endurance: Shackleton&#x27;s Legendary Antarctic Expedition&quot; was open to the public for six months from April to October 1999 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It included artefacts, film footage and diaries from the 1914 expedition, as well as a chronological display of more than 150 photographs taken by Frank Hurley, all specially reprinted from the original negatives.

In 2002, Channel 4 in the UK produced &quot;Shackleton&quot;, a TV serial depicting the 1914 expedition with Kenneth Branagh in the title role. Broadcast in the US on the A&amp;E Network, it won two Emmy Awards. An asteroid discovered by Swiss amateur astronomer Michel Ory in March 2005 was named &quot;289586 Shackleton&quot; in his memory. At a Christie&#x27;s auction in London in 2011, a biscuit that Shackleton gave &quot;a starving fellow traveller&quot; on the 1907–1909 &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition sold for £1,250. That same year, on the date of what would have been Shackleton&#x27;s 137th birthday, Google honoured him with a Google Doodle.

In January 2013, a joint British-Australian team set out to duplicate Shackleton&#x27;s 1916 trip across the Southern Ocean. Led by explorer and environmental scientist Tim Jarvis, the team was assembled at the request of Alexandra Shackleton, Sir Ernest&#x27;s granddaughter, who felt the trip would honour her grandfather&#x27;s legacy. This team became the first to replicate the so-called &quot;double crossing&quot;, sailing from Elephant Island to South Georgia and crossing the South Georgian mountains from King Haakon Bay (where Shackleton had landed nearly 100 years prior) to Stromness. The expedition very carefully matched legacy conditions, using a replica of the &quot;James Caird&quot; (named for the project&#x27;s patron: the &quot;Alexandra Shackleton&quot;), period clothing (by Burberry), replica rations (both in calorific content and rough constitution), period navigational aids, and a Thomas Mercer chronometer just as Shackleton had used. This expedition was made into a documentary film, screening as &quot;Chasing Shackleton&quot; on PBS in the US, and &quot;&quot; elsewhere on the Discovery Channel.

A genus of lichen-forming fungi in the Teloschistaceae family was published in 2013 as &quot;Shackletonia&quot; by botanists Søchting, Frödén &amp; Arup. In October 2015, Shackleton&#x27;s decorations and medals were auctioned at Christie&#x27;s, raising a total of £585,000. Shackleton featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail in January 2016 to mark the centenary of the &quot;Endurance&quot; expedition. In August 2016, a statue of Shackleton by Mark Richards was erected in Athy, sponsored by Kildare County Council.

The musical play &quot;Ernest Shackleton Loves Me&quot; by Val Vigoda and Joe DiPietro made its debut in 2017 at the Tony Kiser Theater, an off-Broadway venue in New York City. Blended with a parallel story of a struggling composer, the play retells the adventure of &quot;Endurance&quot; in detail, incorporating photos and videos of the journey.

In February 2024 a memorial plaque to Shackleton sculpted by Will Davies was unveiled in the south cloister of Westminster Abbey by Anne, Princess Royal.

Lego included Shacketon&#x27;s lifeboat as a Gift With Purchase for anyone who bought the Endurance between a certain timeframe. Included is a minifigure of Shackleton and photographer Frank Hurley.

<doc id="60005" wikidata="Q434281" url="?curid=60005" title="Douglas Mawson">
<text>Sir Douglas Mawson (5 May 1882 – 14 October 1958) was a British-born Australian geologist, Antarctic explorer, and academic. Along with Roald Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott, and Sir Ernest Shackleton, he was a key expedition leader during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.

Mawson was born in England and was brought to Australia as an infant. He completed degrees in mining engineering and geology at the University of Sydney. In 1905 he was made a lecturer in petrology and mineralogy at the University of Adelaide. Mawson&#x27;s first experience in the Antarctic came as a member of Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition (1907–1909), alongside his mentor Edgeworth David. They were part of the expedition&#x27;s northern party, which became the first to attain the South magnetic pole and to climb Mount Erebus.

After his participation in Shackleton&#x27;s expedition, Mawson became the principal instigator of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (1911–1914). The expedition explored thousands of kilometres of previously unexplored regions, collected geological and botanical samples, and made important scientific observations. Mawson was the sole survivor of the three-man Far Eastern Party, which travelled across the Mertz and Ninnis Glaciers named after his two deceased companions. Their deaths forced him to travel alone for over a month to return to the expedition&#x27;s main base.

Mawson was knighted in 1914, and during the second half of World War I worked as a non-combatant with the British and Russian militaries. He returned to the University of Adelaide in 1919 and became a full professor in 1921, contributing much to Australian geology. He returned to the Antarctic as the leader of the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (1929–1931), which led to a territorial claim in the form of the Australian Antarctic Territory. Mawson is commemorated by numerous landmarks and from 1984 to 1996 appeared on the Australian $100 note.

== Early life ==
Mawson was born on 5 May 1882 to Robert Ellis Mawson and Margaret Ann Moore. He was born in Shipley, West Riding of Yorkshire, but was less than two years old when his family emigrated to Australia and settled at Rooty Hill, now in the western suburbs of Sydney. Later he and his family moved to the inner-Sydney suburb of Glebe in 1893. He attended Forest Lodge Public School, Fort Street Model School and the University of Sydney, where he graduated in 1902 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree.

== Early work ==
He was appointed geologist to an expedition to the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) in 1903; his report, &quot;The Geology of the New Hebrides&quot;, was one of the first major geological works of Melanesia. Also that year he published a geological paper on Mittagong, New South Wales. His major influences in his geological career were Professor Edgeworth David and Professor Archibald Liversidge. He then became a lecturer in petrology and mineralogy at the University of Adelaide in 1905. In 1906 he identified and first described the mineral davidite.

== &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition (or British Antarctic Expedition) ==

Mawson joined Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition (1907–1909) to the Antarctic, originally intending to stay for the duration of the ship&#x27;s presence in the first summer. Instead both he and his mentor, Edgeworth David, stayed an extra year. In doing so they became, in the company of Alistair Mackay, the first to climb the summit of Mount Erebus and to trek to the South magnetic pole, which at that time was over land.

During their stay, they also wrote, illustrated and printed the book &quot;Aurora Australis&quot;. Mawson contributed with the science fiction short-story Bathybia.

== Australasian Antarctic Expedition ==
Mawson turned down an invitation to join Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s Terra Nova Expedition in 1910; Australian geologist Thomas Griffith Taylor went with Scott instead. Mawson chose to lead his own expedition, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, to George V Land and Adélie Land, the sector of the Antarctic continent immediately south of Australia, which at the time was almost entirely unexplored.

The objectives were to carry out geographical exploration and scientific studies, including a visit to the South magnetic pole.
Mawson raised the necessary funds in a year, from British and Australian governments, and from commercial backers interested in mining and whaling.

The expedition, using the ship commanded by Captain John King Davis, departed from Hobart on 2 December 1911, landed at Cape Denison (named after Hugh Denison, a major backer of the expedition) on Commonwealth Bay on 8 January 1912, and established the Main Base. A second camp was located to the west on the ice shelf in Queen Mary Land. Cape Denison proved to be unrelentingly windy; the average wind speed for the entire year was about , with some winds approaching . They built a hut on the rocky cape and wintered through nearly constant blizzards. Mawson wanted to do aerial exploration and brought the first aeroplane to Antarctica. The aircraft, a Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane, was to be flown by Francis Howard Bickerton. When it was damaged in Australia shortly before the expedition departed, plans were changed so it was to be used only as a tractor on skis. However, the engine did not operate well in the cold, and it was removed and returned to Vickers in England. The aircraft fuselage itself was abandoned. On 1 January 2009, fragments of it were rediscovered by the Mawson&#x27;s Huts Foundation, which is restoring the original huts.

Mawson&#x27;s exploration program was carried out by five parties from the Main Base and two from the Western Base. Mawson himself was part of a three-man sledging team, the Far Eastern Party, with Xavier Mertz and Lieutenant Belgrave Ninnis, who headed east on 10 November 1912, to survey George V Land. After five weeks of excellent progress mapping the coastline and collecting geological samples, the party was crossing the Ninnis Glacier 480 km east of the main base. Mertz was skiing and Mawson was on his sled with his weight dispersed, but Ninnis was jogging beside the second sled. Ninnis fell through a crevasse, and his body weight is likely to have breached the snow bridge covering it. The six best dogs, most of the party&#x27;s rations, their tent, and other essential supplies disappeared into the massive crevasse. Mertz and Mawson spotted one dead and one injured dog on a ledge below them, but Ninnis was never seen again.

After a brief service, Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one week&#x27;s provisions for two men and no dog food but plenty of fuel and a Primus stove. They sledged for 27 hours continuously to obtain a spare tent cover they had left behind, for which they improvised a frame from skis and a theodolite. Their lack of provisions forced them to use their remaining sled dogs to feed the other dogs and themselves:
There was a quick deterioration in the men&#x27;s physical condition during this journey. Both men suffered dizziness; nausea; abdominal pain; irrationality; mucosal fissuring; skin, hair, and nail loss; and the yellowing of eyes and skin. Later Mawson noticed a dramatic change in his travelling companion. Mertz seemed to lose the will to move and wished only to remain in his sleeping bag. He began to deteriorate rapidly with diarrhoea and madness. On one occasion Mertz refused to believe he was suffering from frostbite and bit off the tip of his own little finger. This was soon followed by violent raging—Mawson had to sit on his companion&#x27;s chest and hold down his arms to prevent him from damaging their tent. Mertz suffered further seizures before falling into a coma and dying on 8 January 1913.

It was unknown at the time that high levels of vitamin A are toxic to humans, causing liver damage, and that husky liver contains extremely high levels of the vitamin. With six dogs between them (with a liver on average weighing ), it is thought that the pair ingested enough liver to cause the toxicity syndrome hypervitaminosis A, which can be fatal. Mertz may have eaten more of the liver because he had been used to a vegetarian diet, and so may have found the tough muscle tissue difficult to eat, thus being exposed to greater toxicity than Mawson.

Mawson continued the final alone. During his return trip to the Main Base he fell through the lid of a crevasse, and was saved only by his sledge wedging itself into the ice above him. He managed to climb out using the harness attaching him to the sled.

When Mawson finally made it back to Cape Denison, the ship &quot;Aurora&quot; had left only a few hours before. It was recalled by wireless communication, only to have bad weather thwart the rescue effort. Mawson and six men who had remained behind to look for him wintered a second year until December 1913. In Mawson&#x27;s book &quot;Home of the Blizzard&quot;, he describes his experiences. His party, and those at the Western Base, had explored large areas of the Antarctic coast, describing its geology, biology and meteorology, and more closely defining the location of the South magnetic pole. In 1915, the Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Founder&#x27;s Medal and in 1916 the American Geographical Society awarded him the David Livingstone Centenary Medal.

The expedition was the subject of David Roberts&#x27; book &quot;Alone on the Ice: The Greatest Survival Story in the History of Exploration&quot;.

=== &quot;Home of the Blizzard&quot; ===

In his book &quot;The Home of the Blizzard&quot;, Mawson talked of &quot;Herculean gusts&quot; on 24 May 1912 which he learned afterwards &quot;approached two hundred miles per hour&quot;. Mawson reported that the average wind speed for March was ; for April, ; and for May, . These katabatic winds can reach around and led Mawson to dub Cape Denison &quot;the windiest place on Earth&quot;.

== Later life ==
Mawson married Francisca Adriana (Paquita) Delprat (daughter of the metallurgist G. D. Delprat) on 31 March 1914 at Holy Trinity Church of England, Balaclava, Victoria. They had two daughters, Patricia and Jessica. Also in 1914, he was knighted, and was preoccupied with news of the Scott disaster until the outbreak of World War I. Mawson served 1916-1919 as a Captain (later acting-Major) in the British Ministry of Munitions, based in Liverpool. During this period he established a very close personal relationship with Kathleen Scott, the widow of polar explorer Robert Falcon Scott.

Returning to the University of Adelaide in 1919, he was promoted to the professorship of geology and mineralogy in 1921, and made a major contribution to Australian geology. He organised and led the joint British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) in 1929–31, which resulted in the formation of the Australian Antarctic Territory in 1936. He also spent much of his time researching the geology of the northern Flinders Ranges in South Australia. He also served on the Council and later as President of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia. Mawson was Honorary Curator of Minerals for the South Australian Museum from 1907 to 1958, and also Chair of the South Australian Museum Board of Governors from 1951 to 1958.

Upon his retirement from teaching in 1952 he was made an emeritus professor of the University of Adelaide. He died at his Brighton home in South Australia on 14 October 1958 from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 76 years old. At the time of his death he had still not completed editorial work on all the papers resulting from his expedition, and this was completed by his eldest daughter, Patricia, only in 1975.
==Legacy==
In 1948, Carroll William Dodge published a genus of fungi within the family Lichinaceae, named &quot;Mawsonia&quot; in his honour.

His image appeared on several postage stamps of the Australian Antarctic Territory: 5 pence (1961), 5 pence (1961), 27 cents and 75 cents (1982),
10 cents (2011), 45 cents (1999).

His image appeared from 1984 to 1996 on the Australian paper one hundred dollar note and in 2012 on a $1 coin issued within the Inspirational Australians series. Mawson Peak (Heard Island), Mount Mawson (Tasmania), Mawson Station (Antarctica), Dorsa Mawson (Mare Fecunditatis), the geology building on the main University of Adelaide campus, suburbs in Canberra and Adelaide, a University of South Australian campus and the main street of Meadows, South Australia are named after him. At Oxley College in Burradoo, New South Wales, a sports house is called Mawson, as is at Clarence High School in Hobart, Tasmania, Forest Lodge Public School and Street High School, both in Sydney, where he was educated. The Mawson Collection of Antarctic exploration artefacts is on permanent display at the South Australian Museum, including a screening of a recreated version of his journey that was shown on ABC Television on 12 May 2008.

Mawson (postcode 2607) is a suburb of Canberra, district of Woden Valley, Australian Capital Territory. The suburb was gazetted in 1966 and is named after him. The theme for street names in this area is Antarctic exploration.

In 2011, Ranulph Fiennes included Mawson in his book &quot;My Heroes: Extraordinary Courage, Exceptional People&quot;.

In 2013 the &quot;Australian Mawson Centenary Expedition&quot;, led by Chris Turney and Chris Fogwill, undertook a voyage to investigate Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic oceanography, climate and biology. Their ship, the MV &quot;Akademik Shokalskiy&quot;, became trapped in ice. The expedition later visited Mawson&#x27;s huts at Cape Denison on Commonwealth Bay.

After the release of Mawson&#x27;s journals and other expedition records, some historians have questioned Mawson&#x27;s navigation, risk-taking and leadership.

In December 2013, the first opera to be based on Mawson&#x27;s 1911–1914 expedition to Antarctica, &quot;The Call of Aurora&quot; (by Tasmanian composer Joe Bugden) was performed at The Peacock Theatre in Hobart. &quot;The Call of Aurora&quot; investigates the relationship between Douglas Mawson and his wireless operator, Sidney Jeffryes, who developed symptoms of paranoia and had to be relieved of his duties.

In 2019, Australian Dance Theatre presented the premiere of &quot;South&quot; by Artistic Director Garry Stewart in Adelaide. The acclaimed contemporary dance work reflects upon the treacherous journey across the wilds of eastern Antarctica undertaken by Mawson and his ill-fated team in the summer of 1912–1913. Garry Stewart won Outstanding Achievement in Choreography for &quot;South&quot; in 2019 at the Australian Dance Awards, presented by AusDance. The work has since toured regional South Australia.

David Roberts&#x27; account of Mawson&#x27;s AAE expedition, &quot;Alone on the Ice&quot;, and the deadly effect of dog liver are referenced in the plot of an episode of British television series &quot;New Tricks&quot;, where it is used to commit the almost-perfect murder.

The Mawson Trail in South Australia is also named after him.

Minor planet 4456 Mawson is named in his honour.

<doc id="60006" wikidata="Q7216934" url="?curid=60006" title="Police perjury">
<text>In criminal law, police perjury, sometimes euphemistically called &quot;testilying&quot;, is the act of a police officer knowingly giving false testimony. It is typically used in a criminal trial to &quot;make the case&quot; against defendants believed by the police to be guilty when irregularities during the suspects&#x27; arrest or search threaten to result in their acquittal. It also can be extended to encompass substantive misstatements of fact to convict those whom the police believe to be guilty, procedural misstatements to &quot;justify&quot; a search and seizure, or even the inclusion of statements to frame an innocent citizen. More generically, it has been said to be &quot;[l]ying under oath, especially by a police officer, to help get a conviction.&quot;

==United States==

When police lie under oath, innocent people can be convicted and jailed; hundreds of convictions have been set aside as a result of such police misconduct. Some sources say that it is both a police and a prosecutorial problem and that it is a systemic response to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, which was recognized in the US Supreme Court decision &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot;. Other authors have drawn a connection between perjury and an increased emphasis on the number of arrests and convictions made. 

The extent of the practice is debated; journalists, activists, and defense attorneys have exposed numerous instances of false testimony, but police officers and police unions, while acknowledging its occurrence, deny that it is widespread or systemic. The defense attorney Alan Dershowitz argued, in the New York Times and before a congressional hearing, that police perjury is commonplace: 
As I read about the disbelief expressed by some prosecutors... I thought of Claude Rains&#x27;s classic response, in &quot;Casablanca&quot; on being told there was gambling in Rick&#x27;s place: &quot;I&#x27;m shocked—shocked.&quot; For anyone who has practiced criminal law in the state or Federal courts, the disclosures about rampant police perjury cannot possibly come as a surprise. &quot;Testilying&quot;—as the police call it—has long been an open secret among prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges.

In 1995, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton had created a furor by saying that he agreed with most of Dershowitz&#x27;s statement. The &quot;Globe&quot; quoted Richard Bradley, then-president of the Boston Police Patrolmen&#x27;s Association: &quot;I find it incredible that he would say that. Every day all over the country, police officers are testifying. Everyone realizes they are testifying under oath. If this was this much a problem, it would have come to light over the years.&quot; Bradley said that in 27 years on the Boston force he had never encountered the practice.

In a 1996 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Has the Drug War Created an Officer Liars&#x27; Club?&quot;, Joseph D. McNamara, the chief of police of San Jose, said, &quot;Not many people took defense attorney Alan M. Dershowitz seriously when he charged that Los Angeles cops are taught to lie at the birth of their careers at the Police Academy. But as someone who spent 35 years wearing a police uniform, I&#x27;ve come to believe that hundreds of thousands of law-enforcement officers commit felony perjury every year testifying about drug arrests.&quot; He also noted, &quot;Within the last few years, police departments in Los Angeles, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco, Denver, New York and in other large cities have suffered scandals involving police personnel lying under oath about drug evidence.&quot;

In 2011, after finding a former police detective, Jason Arbeeny, guilty of official misconduct for planting drugs on a suspect, Justice Gustin L. Reichbach of the New York Supreme Court wrote that he &quot;thought [he] was not naïve, but even this court was shocked, not only by the seeming pervasive scope of misconduct but even more distressingly by the seeming casualness by which such conduct is employed.&quot; Arbeeny was then sentenced to five years of probation and 300 hours of community service. Also in 2011, a former San Francisco Police Commissioner, Peter Keane, wrote that lying under oath was a &quot;routine practice&quot; for narcotics officers.

In 2019, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court called out the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Division of the US Department of Justice for dishonesty in applications for continuance of a wiretap of Carter Page, saying that it called into question the reliability of other evidence submitted by the FBI. The practice was documented in a previous report released by the Department of Justice&#x27;s Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, and was cited by the court.

Police officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as &quot;Brady cops.&quot; In &quot;Brady v. Maryland&quot;, the US Supreme Court held that prosecutors are required to notify defendants and their attorneys of any favorable evidence, such as if a law enforcement official involved in a case has a sustained record of knowingly lying in an official capacity.

==Remedies==
A police officer&#x27;s reputation for trustworthiness is an important asset to their effectiveness; police who have been caught lying to the court make poor witnesses, and previous convictions relying on their testimony can be vacated if their misconduct is pervasive. This can result in termination, and such terminations have been judicially enforced. About a perjured affidavit supporting a raid that killed two, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said &quot;that&#x27;s totally unacceptable. I&#x27;ve told my police department that if you lie, you die. When you lie on an affidavit, that&#x27;s not sloppy police work, that&#x27;s a crime.&quot;

Some suggest that narrowing or blunting the exclusionary rule may get rid of the incentive for police to lie to the court. That has happened to the extent that the US Supreme Court has recognized exceptions like the &quot;good faith exception.&quot; Some argue that civil liability could have a prophylactic effect on police misconduct. Others suggest that the ubiquity of video recordings, both by the police and by civilians, will operate to slow down the misconduct and to reverse the trend.

<text>The Zangger Committee, also known as the Nuclear Exporters Committee, sprang from Article III.2 of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which entered into force on March 5, 1970. Under the terms of Article III.2 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards must be applied to nuclear exports.

:Each State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide: (a) source or special fissionable material, or (b) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this Article.

==History==
Between 1971 and 1974, a group of 15 nuclear supplier states held a series of informal meetings in Vienna chaired by Professor Claude Zangger of Switzerland. The group&#x27;s objective was to reach a common understanding on: (a) the definition of &quot;equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material;&quot; and (b) the conditions and procedures that would govern exports of such equipment or material in order to meet the obligations of Article III.2 on the basis of fair commercial competition. The group, which became known as the Zangger Committee, decided that it would be informal and that its decisions would not be legally binding upon its members.

The committee (a) maintains and updates a list of equipment that may only be exported if safeguards are applied to the recipient facility (called the &quot;Trigger List&quot; because such exports trigger the requirement for safeguards); and (b) allows members to coordinate on nuclear export issues. The relative informality of the Zangger Committee has enabled it to take the lead on certain nonproliferation issues that would be more difficult to resolve in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Moreover, the People&#x27;s Republic of China is a member of the Zangger Committee.

At the October 2000 meeting, the committee discussed the results of the 2000 NPT Review Conference (REVCON). The committee agreed to form two informal &quot;Friends of the Chair&quot; groups to: 1) consider preparations for the 2005 NPT REVCON; and 2) continue consideration of possible future adoption of a policy of requiring full-scope safeguards as a condition of supply to non-nuclear weapon states. The U.S. reported on the status of consideration of possible additional controls on americium and neptunium. Members agreed that these materials fell outside the scope of NPT Article III.2 for inclusion on the Trigger List. Sweden, chair of a working group to consider addition of plutonium enrichment equipment to the Trigger List, reported no agreement as yet. The chairman reported on an initial informal meeting with IAEA staff to discuss procedures for keeping the agency informed on Trigger List changes and the rationale for such changes, since the agency uses the Zangger Trigger List as a reference document.

==Chairs==
The following have served as chairs of the Zangger Committee:

*1971–1989: Dr. Claude Zangger (Switzerland)
*1989–1993: Ilkka Mäkipentti (Finland)

<doc id="60010" wikidata="Q162528" url="?curid=60010" title="Thaler">
<text>A thaler or taler ( ; , previously spelled ) is one of the large silver coins minted in the states and territories of the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg monarchy during the Early Modern period. A &quot;thaler&quot; size silver coin has a diameter of about and a weight of about 25 to 30 grams (roughly 1 ounce). The word is shortened from , the original &quot;thaler&quot; coin minted in Joachimsthal, Bohemia, from 1520.

While the first standard coin of the Holy Roman Empire was the of 1524, its longest-lived coin was the , which contained Cologne Mark of fine silver (or 25.984 g), and which was issued in various versions from 1566 to 1875. From the 17th century a lesser-valued &quot;North German thaler&quot; currency unit emerged, which by the 19th century became par with the .

The &quot;thaler&quot; silver coin type continued to be minted until the 20th century in the form of the Mexican peso until 1914, the five Swiss franc coin until 1928, the US silver dollar until 1935, and the Austrian Maria Theresa thaler. These days thaler-sized silver coins are not in active circulation anymore, but are minted by various government mints as bullion or numismatic items for collectors. The current derivative of the name, &quot;dollar&quot; (first Spanish and now mostly English), also survives as the name of several modern currencies.

==Etymology==
German &quot;taler&quot; is recorded from the 1530s, as an abbreviation of &quot;Joachimstaler&quot;. The silver mines at Joachimstal had opened in 1516, and the first such coins were minted there in 1518.
The original spelling was &quot;taler&quot; (so Alberus 1540).
German &quot;-taler&quot; means &quot;of the valley&quot; (cf. &quot;Neanderthaler&quot;).
By the late 16th century, the word was variously spelled as German &quot;taler&quot;, &quot;toler&quot;, &quot;thaler&quot;, &quot;thaller&quot;; Low German &quot;daler&quot;, &quot;dahler&quot;.
In 18th to 19th-century German orthography, &quot;Thaler&quot; became standard, changed to &quot;Taler&quot; in the 1902 spelling reform.

The name &quot;taler&quot;, &quot;thaler&quot; was soon used in compounds denoting various types of silver coins of thaler size, thus &quot;Reichstaler&quot; (1566), &quot;Silbertaler&quot;, &quot;Albertustaler&quot; (1612), &quot;Laubthaler&quot; (1726), &quot;Kronenthaler&quot; (1755), &quot;Ortsthaler&quot;, &quot;Schützentaler&quot;, &quot;Bankthaler&quot;, &quot;Speciethaler&quot;, etc.

Units used in the Netherlands include the , the &quot;rijksdaalder&quot; and the . From 1754, many German states used the &quot;Conventionsthaler&quot; as well as a lower-valued &quot;North German thaler&quot; or &quot;Reichsthaler&quot; worth the Conventionsthaler. From 1840 the various North German thalers converged to the value of the Prussian thaler and afterwards the &quot;Vereinsthaler&quot;.

The corresponding English silver coin of the period was the &quot;crown&quot;. The Low German word was adopted in English as &quot;daler&quot; by 1550, modified to &quot;dollar&quot; by about 1600.
English &quot;thaler&quot; was introduced in the first half of the 19th century to refer to the coins of the German states, as the word &quot;dollar&quot; was increasingly understood to refer to the United States dollar.

==Predecessors==
The development of large silver coins is an innovation of the beginning Early Modern period.
The largest medieval silver coins were known as groat (German &quot;Groschen&quot;), from &quot;denarius grossus&quot; or &quot;thick penny&quot;. These rarely exceeded a weight of 6 grams.

Even these coins were increasingly debased due to the Great Bullion Famine of the 15th century which occurred for several reasons including continued warfare and the centuries-long loss of silver and gold in indirect one-sided trades importing spices, porcelain, silk and other fine cloths and exotic goods from India, Indonesia and the Far East. This continual debasement had reached a point that silver content in &quot;Groschen&quot;-type coins had dropped, in some cases, to less than five percent, making the coins of much less individual value than they had in the beginning.

This trend was inverted with the discovery of new and substantial silver deposits in Europe beginning in about the 1470s. Italy began the first tentative steps toward a large silver coinage with the introduction in 1472 of the Venetian lira tron in excess of 6 grams, a substantial increase over the 4-gram gros tournois of France. However, it was only in 1484 that Archduke Sigismund of Tirol issued the first truly revolutionary silver coin, the &quot;half Guldengroschen&quot; of roughly 15 g. This was a very rare coin, almost a trial piece, but it did circulate so successfully that demand could not be met.

Finally, with the silver deposits—being mined at Schwaz—to work with and his mint at Hall, Sigismund issued, in 1486, large numbers of the first true thaler-sized coin, the &quot;Guldengroschen&quot; (&quot;gold-groat&quot;, being of silver but equal in value to a Goldgulden). It was an instant and unqualified success. Soon it was being copied widely by many states who had the necessary silver. The engravers, no less affected by the Renaissance than were other artists, began creating intricate and elaborate designs featuring the heraldic arms and standards of the minting state as well as brutally realistic, sometimes unflattering, depictions of the ruler (monarch).

==Joachimsthaler==

By 1518, &quot;guldiners&quot; of similar weight to &quot;guldengroschen&quot; were popping up everywhere in central Europe. In the Kingdom of Bohemia, then ruled together with Hungary by Louis II of the Jagiellonian dynasty, a guldiner was minted— of similar physical size but slightly less fineness—that was named in German the &quot;Joachimsthaler&quot;, from the silver mined by the Counts of Schlick at a rich source near Joachimsthal (today Jáchymov in the Czech Republic) where &quot;Thal&quot; (Tal) means &quot;valley&quot; in German. Saint Joachim, the father of the Virgin Mary, was portrayed on the coin along with the Bohemian lion.

Similar coins began to be minted in neighbouring valleys rich in silver deposits, each named after the particular &#x27;thal&#x27; or valley from which the silver was extracted. There were soon so many of them that these silver coins began to be known more widely as &#x27;thaler&#x27; in German and &#x27;tolar&#x27; in Czech.

In the 17th century, some Joachimsthalers were in circulation in the Tsardom of Russia, where they were called &quot;yefimok&quot; () – a distortion of the name Joachim.

==Holy Roman Empire==
The new large silver coins that became ubiquitous as the 16th century went on were named &quot;Thaler&quot; in German, while in England and France, they were named &quot;crown&quot; and &quot;écu&quot;, respectively, both names taken from what had originally been gold coins. The thaler size silver coins minted in Habsburg Spain was the eight real coin, later also known as peso and in English as the &quot;Spanish dollar&quot;.

The first large silver coin standardized by the Holy Roman Empire was the &quot;Guldengroschen&quot; in 1524. Under the new Imperial Minting Standard (&quot;Reichsmünzfuß&quot;) it weighed th a Cologne Mark of silver or 29.232 g, and had a fineness 0.9375. However, its longest-lasting standard coin was the &quot;Reichsthaler&quot; (&quot;imperial thaler&quot;) defined in 1566 as containing th a Cologne &quot;Mark&quot; of fine silver, or 25.984 g. It was widely adopted and produced for the next 300 years at rates varying from 9 to 9 &quot;Reichsthalers&quot; to the &quot;Mark&quot;.

See the &quot;chronology of thaler development&quot; for the development of the Reichsthaler and related currency units from 1566 to 1875. Confusingly, there also was defined a North German &quot;thaler&quot; currency (also called &quot;Reichsthalers&quot;) of less value to the standard &quot;Reichsthaler&quot; specie coin; this thaler was worth 12 to a &quot;Mark&quot; after 1690, 13 to a &quot;Mark&quot; after 1754, and 14 to a &quot;Mark&quot; (the Prussian thaler) by the 1840s. Furthermore, in 1754 a &quot;Conventionsthaler&quot; was developed by the Austrian Empire minted at 10 to a &quot;Mark&quot; of fine silver. While it was adopted by most German states, Scandinavia and a few North German states retained the original &quot;Reichsthaler&quot; specie of 9 to a &quot;Mark&quot; as their standard coin until 1875.
===City view thalers and lösers===
The &quot;city view&quot; thalers of the 17th and 18th century have predecessors in stylised representations of cities (as three towers, or a city gate) on the obverse of thaler coins in the late 16th century, such as the Lüneburg thaler of Rudolf II made in 1584. More elaborate city views become current in the first half of the 17th century (e.g. Augsburg 1627, Nürnberg 1631).
The type continues to be popular throughout the 18th century, culminating in detailed city panoramas rendered in one-point perspective.

In the late 16th and 17th centuries, there was a fashion of oversized thaler coins, the so-called &quot;multiple thalers&quot;, often called &quot;Löser&quot; in Germany. The first were minted in the Duchy of Brunswick-Luneburg, and indeed the majority were struck there. Some of these coins reached colossal size, as much as sixteen normal thalers, exceeding a full pound (over 450 g) of silver and being over in diameter. The name &quot;Löser&quot; most likely was derived from a large gold coin minted in Hamburg called the &quot;portugalöser&quot;, worth 10 ducats, which were based on Portuguese 10-ducat coins. Eventually the term was applied to numerous similar coins worth more than a single thaler. These coins are very rare and highly sought after by collectors. As few of them were circulated in any real sense, they are often well-preserved.

==Dutch Republic==

The Spanish Netherlands and the independent Dutch Republic has had a history of minting large silver coins separately from the rest of the Holy Roman Empire. It issued the &quot;kruisdaalder&quot; (depicting the Cross of Burgundy) in 1567, and then the &quot;leeuwendaalder&quot; (the &quot;lion thaler&quot;, depicting the Belgic Lion) in 1575, the latter of weight 27.68 g (427.2 grains) and 0.743 fineness. With the growing popularity of the German reichsthaler, however, the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands had to follow up with their own Dutch rijksdaalder in 1583, of weight 29.03 g (448 grains) and 0.885 fineness, and featuring an armored half bust of William the Silent. Friesland, Gelderland, Holland, Kampen, Overijssel, Utrecht, West Friesland, Zeeland, and Zwolle minted armored half bust rijksdaalders until the end of the 17th century.

The pace of depreciation of the small-denomination &quot;stuiver&quot; quickened from the 1570s, with the leeuwendaalder rising from 32 to 40 stuivers by 1619, and the rijksdaalder from 42 to 50 stuivers. The &quot;Amsterdam Wisselbank&quot; was then founded in 1608 to establish a stable bank currency with the rijksdaalder of 29.03 g, 0.875 fine (or 25.4 g fine silver) fixed at 50 stuivers or 2 gulden.

The bank&#x27;s success helped the Dutch Republic become Europe&#x27;s financial center in the 17th century and maintain the reichsthaler as its banking currency unit despite Germany&#x27;s descent into the chaos of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. As a bullion entrepôt of the period, the Netherlands produced reichsthalers for Germany and Scandinavia, and exported leeuwendaalders to the Levant and the Ottoman Empire. The latter survives to this day in the form of the Bulgarian lev, Romanian leu, and Moldovan leu.

Lion Daalders were used a lot in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and in what&#x27;s now known as the USA. The city of New Amsterdam, currently New York, was founded by the Dutch in the early 17th century. &quot;The Lion Daalder holds an important place in American history as America’s first dollar and the root of the word from where the current currency, the US Dollar, found its name.&quot;

By the 18th century the Spanish-controlled Dutch territories eventually became the Austrian Netherlands. In 1754 it issued the Kronenthaler of weight 29.45 g and 0.873 fineness, or 25.71 g fine silver. This coin was adopted by many South German states by the early 19th century.

The term &quot;daalder&quot; continued to refer to 1 &quot;gulden&quot; in currency even after the discontinuation of the 1 gulden or 30 &quot; stuiver&quot; piece in the 19th century.

The &quot;rijksdaalder&quot; was also known as the silver ducat, which is still minted for collectors in the Netherlands today.

==Spain and France==


The discovery of massive silver supplies in Spanish America in the 1530s enabled the massive minting of Spain&#x27;s eight-real coin well into the 20th century, weighing 27.47 g, 0.9306 fine. Being of nearly identical weight to the German reichsthaler, British colonists in North America eventually called the Spanish coin the dollar, which became the model for the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.

The rise of German and Spanish dollars in 16th century European trade lessened the demand for French silver &quot;francs&quot; and &quot;testoons&quot;. In 1641 King Louis XIII therefore introduced a new &quot;Louis d&#x27;Argent&quot; equal to the Spanish dollar and worth three &quot;livres tournois&quot;, weighing 27.19 g and 0.917 fine. In 1726 France issued its own thaler coin, the silver &quot;écu&quot; of 6 livres with about 26.7 g fine silver; it would also find currency in Southern Germany and Switzerland as the &quot;laubthaler&quot;. Finally, in 1795 the French franc was established, with the 5-franc coin of 25.0 g, 90% fine silver being closest in size to the thalers used elsewhere. The French franc system would be expanded to other countries in the advent of the Latin Monetary Union of 1865.

==Switzerland==


The Thirteen Cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy and their Associates each minted their own coins, with most larger silver coins conforming to established German or French standards. Thaler and half thaler coins were minted by the cities of Zürich (1512), Bern, Lucerne, Zug, Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen and Geneva.

The Reformed cities began to represent &quot;city views&quot; on the obverse of their thalers, as they did not have the option to represent either patron saint or ruling princes. The first city view thaler of Zürich was minted in 1651 (the so-called &quot;Vögelitaler&quot;).

By the 18th century, Bern and many Western Swiss cantons adopted the French &quot;écu&quot; or &quot;laubthaler&quot; of 26.7 g fine silver as its most widely used thaler, valued at 4 &quot;livres (francs)&quot; or 40 &quot;batzen&quot; of Bern. In 1798 this system was adopted by the Helvetic Confederation with the first Swiss franc equal to th an écu.

Eventual transition to this first new Swiss franc stalled in the 19th century while public preference shifted to the South German Kronenthaler of 25.71 g fine silver, valued at 3.9 francs or 39 batzen. In 1850 Switzerland established the modern-day Swiss franc at par with the French franc, with 40 Swiss francs exchanged for 7 kronenthaler. The five-franc coin of 25.0 g, 90% fine silver became the coin with the closest value to the different historical thalers.

==Scandinavia==

The name thaler was introduced to Scandinavia as &quot;daler&quot;. The first Swedish &quot;daler&quot; coins were minted in 1534. The Norwegian &quot;speciedaler&quot; was minted from 1560. Later Scandinavian &quot;daler&quot; coins included the Swedish riksdaler (1604) and the Danish rigsdaler (1625). In the early 19th century, these countries introduced their modern currency based on the &quot;daler&quot; unit. In Norway, &quot;speciedaler&quot; was chosen as the currency name in 1816.

These currencies in Denmark and Sweden were replaced by the Danish krone and Swedish krona in 1873, the new currencies introduced by the Scandinavian Monetary Union. Norway joined the Monetary Union and introduced the Norwegian krone in 1876.

==19th-century Germany==

At the beginning of the 19th century the South German states valued the Conventionsthaler at 2.4 South German gulden, or 9.744 grams fine silver per gulden. Afterwards, however, they began to mint the Kronenthaler valued at 2.7 gulden - hence a reduced fine silver content for the gulden at 9.52 g. In 1837, the Prussian thaler was fixed at 1 South German gulden - hence 9.545 g fine silver per gulden.

The North German thaler, valued at a Conventionsthaler or 13 to a Cologne Mark fine silver at the start of the 19th century, was revalued in the 1840s at par with the Prussian thaler, at 14 to a Mark, though with varying subdivisions. In 1857, the Vereinsthaler worth 1 North German thaler or 1 South German gulden was adopted as the standard coin by most German states as well as in the Habsburg Empire. Vereinsthalers were issued until 1871 in Germany and 1867 in Austria.

Within the new German Empire, silver vereinsthaler coins remained unlimited legal tender at a value of 3 German gold marks until 1908 when they were withdrawn and demonetized. Some old countermarked thalers circulated as emergency coinage in Germany during the inflationary period following its defeat in the First World War.

The Maria Theresa thaler, the most famous example of the Conventionsthaler minted from 1751, enjoyed a special role as trade currency and continued to be minted long after the death of Maria Theresa in 1780, with coins minted after her death always showing the year 1780. Francis Joseph of Austria declared it an official trade coinage in 1857 just before it lost legal tender status in Austria following issue of the Vereinsthaler. The Maria Theresa taler became the de facto currency of the Ethiopian Empire in the late 18th century, with the Ethiopian birr introduced at par with this taler, and it continued to be in use into the 20th century in the Horn of Africa, Eastern Africa, India and throughout much of the Arabian Peninsula.

==Legacy==

Though various silver thaler coins were minted in most of Europe until the 1870s, these coins were more often counted in non-thaler currency units like Dutch or Austrian guilders, French francs, Spanish reales, etc. By the mid-19th century the thaler (or reichsthaler, rigsdaler) was still the currency unit used in the North German Confederation and Scandinavia. By 1875 the thaler itself disappeared as currency unit in Europe upon adoption of the gold standard.

Nonetheless, use of the thaler as currency continued outside Europe in the form of the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the various pesos of Spanish America, and the Ethiopian birr. The thaler (and its linguistic variants) would also survive as the informal name of coins identical to the historical coin like the German 3-mark coin, the Dutch 2-gulden coin, the 5-franc coins of the Latin Monetary Union (among them France, Belgium, Switzerland), and the Greek 5-drachma coin (τάληρο, taliro).

Thaler-sized coins minted to late-19th century standards would be minted until 1914 in Mexico and in most of Europe, until 1928 in Switzerland, and until 1934 in the United States. Henceforth thaler-sized silver coins would be minted as bullion or numismatic pieces, among them:
* The Maria Theresa thaler trade coin
* Modern silver commemorative &quot;Talers&quot; minted in German-speaking Europe; e.g. the Swiss &quot;Schützentaler&quot;, the Swiss &quot;Helvetia-Taler&quot;, and the Austrian &quot;Haller-Taler&quot;.
* The American Silver Eagle, which at fine silver is actually heavier than the original silver dollar.

Unrelated to specific coins, the name of the &quot;thaler&quot; survives in various modern currency names, in the form &quot;dollar&quot; in twenty-three currencies used in countries including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United States of America, and also in the Samoan tālā and the Slovenian tolar (before adoption of the euro).

==Chronology of thaler development==
* 1486: Sigismund of Tirol issues his 31.93 g Guldengroschen of 60 Kreuzers and .9375 fineness.
* 1493: Switzerland issues its first Guldengroschen at Bern
* 1499: Hungary issues the first Guldiner/Guldengroschen. It is the earliest year of issue with Arabic numerals on the coins in Hungary.
* 1500: The first German Guldengroschen is issued from Saxony weighing 29.232 grams, or eight to a Cologne Mark.
* 1518: The first coin actually called a &quot;Thaler&quot; is minted in Joachimsthal, Bohemia, Holy Roman Empire, also weighing 29.232 g.
* 1524: The money ordinance Reichsmünzordnung issued at Esslingen is the first attempt at a standard currency system for the Holy Roman Empire. It fixed the weight of the guldengroschen weight at 29.232 g (or 1/8th a Cologne Mark, or 233.856 g), its fineness at 0.9375, and proposed it be divided into 21 groschen or 60 kreuzer.
* 1534: Saxony and Bohemia alter the fineness of their guldiners (or 1-guilder coin) down from .9375 purity to .903 while maintaining the same coin weight, thus lowering the actual amount of pure silver in the coin. This made the imperial Guldengroschen worth more than the locally issued guldiner.
* 1551: A new money ordinance is decreed in Augsburg that lowered the guldengroschen&#x27;s fineness to 0.882 but raised its weight to 31.18 g. Many German states begin to accept this standard guldengroschen, but valued higher at 24 groschen or 72 kreuzer, further reinforcing its separation from the accounting gulden defined as only 60 kreuzer. A huge variety of other accounting subdivisions of the coin prevailed throughout the Empire.
* 1559: After the death of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, yet another money ordinance is decreed at Augsburg, which discontinued the 72-kreuzer guldengroschen (minted at 8.533 to a Cologne Mark of fine silver) in favor of a 60-kreuzer &quot;guldiner&quot; or 1-gulden coin minted at 10.24 to a Mark.
* 1566: Protestations over the disappearance of the &quot;guldengroschen&quot; resulted in the issuance of the &quot;Reichsthaler&quot; (known later as the &quot;Speciesthaler&quot;), of weight 29.232 g and fineness 0.889 (hence, 9 Specie Reichsthalers issued to a Cologne Mark of fine silver). While modestly lighter than the guldengroschen, its public acceptance at the same price of 24 groschen or 72 kreuzer (or 10.8 guilders to a Mark) doomed the now-underpriced guldiner.
* 1618: The Reichsthaler was valued at 24 groschen, or 90 kreuzer, or 1 gulden on the eve of the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618–1648 and the Kipper und Wipper financial crisis which destroyed Germany&#x27;s various monetary systems.
* 1667: An agreement made at the Abbey of Zinna between Saxony, Brandenburg, and Brunswick-Lüneburg to help make the minting of small coins more economical than could be done under the old Augsburg ordinances led to the creation of a lower-valued Thaler, still worth 1 gulden or 90 kreuzer, but equal to of the original Speciethaler (or 10 Zinnaische thalers to a Cologne Mark of fine silver). Northern European states like Denmark, Hamburg and Lübeck acceded to this convention.
* 1690: The Leipzig Money Convention met to deal with the poor quality of coinage in Saxony, Brandenburg, and Brunswick, as well as the limited acceptance of the 1667 Zinnaische standard. The agreement reached was to reduce the North German thaler further to the Speciethaler, or 12 Leipzig thalers minted from a Cologne Mark of fine silver. The Leipzig standard eventually prevailed all over the Empire, with a variety of subdivisions still used by the different states for this thaler: 1 gulden, 90 kreuzer, 24 gutegroschen, 36 mariengroschen, etc. 
* 1750: This year saw yet another reduction in weight in the areas controlled by Prussia, Hesse, and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel down to just 22.272 g and a .750 fineness. 14 Prussian thalers were minted from a Cologne mark of fine silver.
* 1754: The monetary agreement between Austria and Bavaria in 1753 replaced the original Speciethaler by a new Conventionsthaler, with ten to a Cologne Mark of fine silver (or 23.3856 g). Its weight was 28.06 g with a fineness of .833. This Conventionsthaler was worth 1 North German thalers, or 1.4 Prussian thalers, or 2 Austro-Hungarian florins, or 2.4 South German gulden. Over time this coin would spread into a large portion of central and southern Germany but not in Scandinavia.
* From 1820: The Kronenthaler (a thaler with 3 or 4 crowns between the Burgundy cross), a coin first issued in 1754 by the Austrian Empire for use in the Austrian Netherlands (present-day Belgium), became widely adopted by various Southern German that the rate of to 2.7 South German gulden. The kronenthaler had a weight of 29.45 g and a fineness of .873.
* From 1837: the Prussia-led Zollverein customs union led to a more vigorous transition into the Prussian currency standard, with North German thalers being replaced by lower-valued Prussian thalers worth 14 to a Cologne Mark of fine silver (or 16.704 g), and with each thaler now divided into 30 silbergroschen. The Prussian thaler was also fixed at 1 South German gulden.
* 1857: The Vienna monetary contract finally eliminates the Cologne Mark as a standard against which the silver coinage of Austria and Germany are reckoned, replacing it with a simple tariff of 500 g fine silver. 30 Vereinsthalers are set to be minted from this 500 g standard (hence 16.67 g fine silver, or weight 18.52 g .900 fine). The Vereinsthaler was made equal to 1 Austro-Hungarian florins, 1 South German gulden, 30 silbergroschen, and other subdivisions.
* 1873: The gold standard was adopted by the newly unified German Empire, with the silver Vereinsthaler remaining unlimited legal tender at three gold marks despite its bullion value dropping below 3 gold marks over the next several years.
* 1908: The Vereinsthaler was officially demonetised in Germany and made worth only bullion value.

<text>In mathematics, a formal series is an infinite sum that is considered independently from any notion of convergence, and can be manipulated with the usual algebraic operations on series (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, partial sums, etc.).

A formal power series is a special kind of formal series, of the form 
:formula_1
where the formula_2 called &quot;coefficients&quot;, are numbers or, more generally, elements of some ring, and the formula_3 are formal powers of the symbol formula_4 that is called an indeterminate or, commonly, a variable. Hence, power series can be viewed as a generalization of polynomials where the number of terms is allowed to be infinite, and differ from usual power series by the absence of convergence requirements, which implies that a power series may not represent a function of its variable. Formal power series are in one to one correspondence with their sequences of coefficients, but the two concepts must not be confused, since the operations that can be applied are different.

A formal power series with coefficients in a ring formula_5 is called a formal power series over formula_6 The formal power series over a ring formula_5 form a ring, commonly denoted by formula_8 (It can be seen as the -adic completion of the polynomial ring formula_9 in the same way as the -adic integers are the -adic completion of the ring of the integers.)

Formal powers series in several indeterminates are defined similarly by replacing the powers of a single indeterminate by monomials in several indeterminates.

Formal power series are widely used in combinatorics for representing sequences of integers as generating functions. In this context, a recurrence relation between the elements of a sequence may often be interpreted as a differential equation that the generating function satisfies. This allows using methods of complex analysis for combinatorial problems (see analytic combinatorics).

==Introduction==
A formal power series can be loosely thought of as an object that is like a polynomial, but with infinitely many terms. Alternatively, for those familiar with power series (or Taylor series), one may think of a formal power series as a power series in which we ignore questions of convergence by not assuming that the variable &quot;X&quot; denotes any numerical value (not even an unknown value). For example, consider the series

:formula_10

If we studied this as a power series, its properties would include, for example, that its radius of convergence is 1 by the Cauchy–Hadamard theorem. However, as a formal power series, we may ignore this completely; all that is relevant is the sequence of coefficients [1, −3, 5, −7, 9, −11, ...]. In other words, a formal power series is an object that just records a sequence of coefficients. It is perfectly acceptable to consider a formal power series with the factorials [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, ... ] as coefficients, even though the corresponding power series diverges for any nonzero value of &quot;X&quot;.

Algebra on formal power series is carried out by simply pretending that the series are polynomials. For example, if

:formula_11

then we add &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; term by term:

:formula_12

We can multiply formal power series, again just by treating them as polynomials (see in particular Cauchy product):

:formula_13

Notice that each coefficient in the product &quot;AB&quot; only depends on a &quot;finite&quot; number of coefficients of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. For example, the &quot;X&quot;5 term is given by

:formula_14

For this reason, one may multiply formal power series without worrying about the usual questions of absolute, conditional and uniform convergence which arise in dealing with power series in the setting of analysis.

Once we have defined multiplication for formal power series, we can define multiplicative inverses as follows. The multiplicative inverse of a formal power series &quot;A&quot; is a formal power series &quot;C&quot; such that &quot;AC&quot; = 1, provided that such a formal power series exists. It turns out that if &quot;A&quot; has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique, and we denote it by &quot;A&quot;−1. Now we can define division of formal power series by defining &quot;B&quot;/&quot;A&quot; to be the product &quot;BA&quot;−1, provided that the inverse of &quot;A&quot; exists. For example, one can use the definition of multiplication above to verify the familiar formula

:formula_15

An important operation on formal power series is coefficient extraction. In its most basic form, the coefficient extraction operator formula_16 applied to a formal power series formula_17 in one variable extracts the coefficient of the formula_18th power of the variable, so that formula_19 and formula_20. Other examples include

:formula_21

Similarly, many other operations that are carried out on polynomials can be extended to the formal power series setting, as explained below.

==The ring of formal power series==
If one considers the set of all formal power series in &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, the elements of this set collectively constitute another ring which is written formula_22 and called the ring of formal power series in the variable &quot;X&quot; over &quot;R&quot;.

===Definition of the formal power series ring===
One can characterize formula_23 abstractly as the completion of the polynomial ring formula_24 equipped with a particular metric. This automatically gives formula_23 the structure of a topological ring (and even of a complete metric space). But the general construction of a completion of a metric space is more involved than what is needed here, and would make formal power series seem more complicated than they are. 
It is possible to describe formula_23 more explicitly, and define the ring structure and topological structure separately, as follows.

====Ring structure====
As a set, formula_23 can be constructed as the set formula_28 of all infinite sequences of elements of formula_5, indexed by the natural numbers (taken to include 0). Designating a sequence whose term at index formula_18 is formula_31 by formula_32, one defines addition of two such sequences by

:formula_33

and multiplication by

:formula_34

This type of product is called the Cauchy product of the two sequences of coefficients, and is a sort of discrete convolution. With these operations, formula_28 becomes a commutative ring with zero element formula_36 and multiplicative identity formula_37.

The product is in fact the same one used to define the product of polynomials in one indeterminate, which suggests using a similar notation. One embeds formula_5 into formula_23 by sending any (constant) formula_40 to the sequence formula_41 and designates the sequence formula_42 by formula_43; then using the above definitions every sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms can be expressed in terms of these special elements as

:formula_44

these are precisely the polynomials in formula_43. Given this, it is quite natural and convenient to designate a general sequence formula_46 by the formal expression formula_47, even though the latter &quot;is not&quot; an expression formed by the operations of addition and multiplication defined above (from which only finite sums can be constructed). This notational convention allows reformulation of the above definitions as

:formula_48

and

:formula_49

which is quite convenient, but one must be aware of the distinction between formal summation (a mere convention) and actual addition.

==== Topological structure ====
Having stipulated conventionally that

one would like to interpret the right hand side as a well-defined infinite summation. To that end, a notion of convergence in formula_28 is defined and a topology on formula_28 is constructed. There are several equivalent ways to define the desired topology.

* We may give formula_28 the product topology, where each copy of formula_5 is given the discrete topology.
* We may give formula_28 the I-adic topology, where formula_55 is the ideal generated by formula_43, which consists of all sequences whose first term formula_57 is zero.
* The desired topology could also be derived from the following metric. The distance between distinct sequences formula_58 is defined to be formula_59 where formula_60 is the smallest natural number such that formula_61; the distance between two equal sequences is of course zero.

Informally, two sequences formula_32 and formula_63 become closer and closer if and only if more and more of their terms agree exactly. Formally, the sequence of partial sums of some infinite summation converges if for every fixed power of formula_43 the coefficient stabilizes: there is a point beyond which all further partial sums have the same coefficient. This is clearly the case for the right hand side of (), regardless of the values formula_31, since inclusion of the term for formula_66 gives the last (and in fact only) change to the coefficient of formula_67. It is also obvious that the limit of the sequence of partial sums is equal to the left hand side.

This topological structure, together with the ring operations described above, form a topological ring. This is called the ring of formal power series over formula_5 and is denoted by formula_23. The topology has the useful property that an infinite summation converges if and only if the sequence of its terms converges to 0, which just means that any fixed power of formula_43 occurs in only finitely many terms.

The topological structure allows much more flexible usage of infinite summations. For instance the rule for multiplication can be restated simply as

:formula_71

since only finitely many terms on the right affect any fixed formula_67. Infinite products are also defined by the topological structure; it can be seen that an infinite product converges if and only if the sequence of its factors converges to 1 (in which case the product is nonzero) or infinitely many factors have no constant term (in which case the product is zero).

==== Alternative topologies ====
The above topology is the finest topology for which

:formula_73

always converges as a summation to the formal power series designated by the same expression, and it often suffices to give a meaning to infinite sums and products, or other kinds of limits that one wishes to use to designate particular formal power series. It can however happen occasionally that one wishes to use a coarser topology, so that certain expressions become convergent that would otherwise diverge. This applies in particular when the base ring formula_5 already comes with a topology other than the discrete one, for instance if it is also a ring of formal power series.

In the ring of formal power series formula_75, the topology of above construction only relates to the indeterminate formula_76, since the topology that was put on formula_77 has been replaced by the discrete topology when defining the topology of the whole ring. So

:formula_78

converges (and its sum can be written as formula_79); however

:formula_80

would be considered to be divergent, since every term affects the coefficient of formula_76. This asymmetry disappears if the power series ring in formula_76 is given the product topology where each copy of formula_77 is given its topology as a ring of formal power series rather than the discrete topology. With this topology, a sequence of elements of formula_75 converges if the coefficient of each power of formula_76 converges to a formal power series in formula_43, a weaker condition than stabilizing entirely. For instance, with this topology, in the second example given above, the coefficient of formula_76converges to formula_88, so the whole summation converges to formula_89.

This way of defining the topology is in fact the standard one for repeated constructions of rings of formal power series, and gives the same topology as one would get by taking formal power series in all indeterminates at once. In the above example that would mean constructing formula_90 and here a sequence converges if and only if the coefficient of every monomial formula_91 stabilizes. This topology, which is also the formula_92-adic topology, where formula_93 is the ideal generated by formula_43 and formula_76, still enjoys the property that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.

The same principle could be used to make other divergent limits converge. For instance in formula_96 the limit

:formula_97

does not exist, so in particular it does not converge to

:formula_98

This is because for formula_99 the coefficient formula_100 of formula_101 does not stabilize as formula_102. It does however converge in the usual topology of formula_103, and in fact to the coefficient formula_104 of formula_105. Therefore, if one would give formula_96 the product topology of formula_107 where the topology of formula_103 is the usual topology rather than the discrete one, then the above limit would converge to formula_105. This more permissive approach is not however the standard when considering formal power series, as it would lead to convergence considerations that are as subtle as they are in analysis, while the philosophy of formal power series is on the contrary to make convergence questions as trivial as they can possibly be. With this topology it would &quot;not&quot; be the case that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.

===Universal property===
The ring formula_23 may be characterized by the following universal property. If formula_111 is a commutative associative algebra over formula_5, if formula_92 is an ideal of formula_111 such that the formula_92-adic topology on formula_111 is complete, and if formula_4 is an element of formula_92, then there is a &quot;unique&quot; formula_119 with the following properties:

* formula_120 is an formula_5-algebra homomorphism
* formula_120 is continuous
* formula_123.

== Operations on formal power series ==
One can perform algebraic operations on power series to generate new power series. Besides the ring structure operations defined above, we have the following.

===Power series raised to powers===
For any natural number , the th power of a formal power series is defined recursively by
formula_124

If and are invertible in the ring of coefficients, one can prove
formula_125
where
formula_126In the case of formal power series with complex coefficients, the complex powers are well defined for series with constant term equal to . In this case, formula_127 can be defined either by composition with the binomial series , or by composition with the exponential and the logarithmic series, formula_128 or as the solution of the differential equation (in terms of series) formula_129 with constant term 1; the three definitions are equivalent. The rules of calculus formula_130 and formula_131 easily follow.

=== Multiplicative inverse ===
The series

:formula_132

is invertible in formula_23 if and only if its constant coefficient formula_57 is invertible in formula_5. This condition is necessary, for the following reason: if we suppose that formula_17 has an inverse formula_137 then the constant term formula_138 of formula_139 is the constant term of the identity series, i.e. it is 1. This condition is also sufficient; we may compute the coefficients of the inverse series formula_140 via the explicit recursive formula

:formula_141

An important special case is that the geometric series formula is valid in formula_23:

:formula_143

If formula_144 is a field, then a series is invertible if and only if the constant term is non-zero, i.e. if and only if the series is not divisible by formula_43. This means that formula_146 is a discrete valuation ring with uniformizing parameter formula_43.

===Division===
The computation of a quotient formula_148

:formula_149

assuming the denominator is invertible (that is, formula_57 is invertible in the ring of scalars), can be performed as a product formula_151 and the inverse of formula_152, or directly equating the coefficients in formula_153:

:formula_154

=== Extracting coefficients ===
The coefficient extraction operator applied to a formal power series

:formula_155

in &quot;X&quot; is written

:formula_156

and extracts the coefficient of &quot;Xm&quot;, so that

:formula_157

=== Composition ===
Given two formal power series

:formula_158
:formula_159
such that formula_160
one may form the &quot;composition&quot;

:formula_161

where the coefficients &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; are determined by &quot;expanding out&quot; the powers of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;):

:formula_162

Here the sum is extended over all (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) with formula_163 and formula_164 with formula_165

Since formula_160 one must have formula_167 and formula_168 for every formula_169 This implies that the above sum is finite and that the coefficient formula_170 is the coefficient of formula_67 in the polynomial formula_172, where formula_173 and formula_174 are the polynomials obtained by truncating the series at formula_175 that is, by removing all terms involving a power of formula_43 higher than formula_177

A more explicit description of these coefficients is provided by Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula, at least in the case where the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0.

Composition is only valid when formula_178 has &quot;no constant term&quot;, so that each formula_170 depends on only a finite number of coefficients of formula_178 and formula_181. In other words, the series for formula_182 converges in the topology of formula_23.

==== Example ====
Assume that the ring formula_5 has characteristic 0 and the nonzero integers are invertible in formula_5. If one denotes by formula_105 the formal power series

:formula_187

then the equality

:formula_188

makes perfect sense as a formal power series, since the constant coefficient of formula_189 is zero.

=== Composition inverse ===
Whenever a formal series

:formula_190

has &quot;f&quot;0 = 0 and &quot;f&quot;1 being an invertible element of &quot;R&quot;, there exists a series

:formula_191

that is the composition inverse of formula_151, meaning that composing formula_151 with formula_152 gives the series representing the identity function formula_195. The coefficients of formula_152 may be found recursively by using the above formula for the coefficients of a composition, equating them with those of the composition identity &quot;X&quot; (that is 1 at degree 1 and 0 at every degree greater than 1). In the case when the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0, the Lagrange inversion formula (discussed below) provides a powerful tool to compute the coefficients of &quot;g&quot;, as well as the coefficients of the (multiplicative) powers of &quot;g&quot;.

=== Formal differentiation ===
Given a formal power series

:formula_197

we define its formal derivative, denoted &quot;Df&quot; or &quot;f&quot; ′, by

:formula_198

The symbol &quot;D&quot; is called the formal differentiation operator. This definition simply mimics term-by-term differentiation of a polynomial.

This operation is &quot;R&quot;-linear:

:formula_199

for any &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and any &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; in formula_200 Additionally, the formal derivative has many of the properties of the usual derivative of calculus. For example, the product rule is valid:

:formula_201

and the chain rule works as well:

:formula_202

whenever the appropriate compositions of series are defined (see above under composition of series).

Thus, in these respects formal power series behave like Taylor series. Indeed, for the &quot;f&quot; defined above, we find that

:formula_203

where &quot;D&quot;&quot;k&quot; denotes the &quot;k&quot;th formal derivative (that is, the result of formally differentiating &quot;k&quot; times).

=== Formal antidifferentiation ===
If formula_5 is a ring with characteristic zero and the nonzero integers are invertible in formula_5, then given a formal power series

:formula_197

we define its formal antiderivative or formal indefinite integral by

:formula_207

for any constant formula_208.

This operation is &quot;R&quot;-linear:

:formula_209

for any &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and any &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; in formula_200 Additionally, the formal antiderivative has many of the properties of the usual antiderivative of calculus. For example, the formal antiderivative is the right inverse of the formal derivative:

:formula_211

for any formula_212.

== Properties ==

=== Algebraic properties of the formal power series ring ===
formula_23 is an associative algebra over formula_5 which contains the ring formula_24 of polynomials over formula_5; the polynomials correspond to the sequences which end in zeros.

The Jacobson radical of formula_23 is the ideal generated by formula_43 and the Jacobson radical of formula_5; this is implied by the element invertibility criterion discussed above.

The maximal ideals of formula_23 all arise from those in formula_5 in the following manner: an ideal formula_222 of formula_23 is maximal if and only if formula_224 is a maximal ideal of formula_5 and formula_222 is generated as an ideal by formula_43 and formula_224.

Several algebraic properties of formula_5 are inherited by formula_23:

* if formula_5 is a local ring, then so is formula_23 (with the set of non units the unique maximal ideal),
* if formula_5 is Noetherian, then so is formula_23 (a version of the Hilbert basis theorem),
* if formula_5 is an integral domain, then so is formula_23, and
* if formula_237 is a field, then formula_146 is a discrete valuation ring.

=== Topological properties of the formal power series ring ===
The metric space formula_239 is complete.

The ring formula_23 is compact if and only if &quot;R&quot; is finite. This follows from Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem and the characterisation of the topology on formula_23 as a product topology.

=== Weierstrass preparation ===

The ring of formal power series with coefficients in a complete local ring satisfies the Weierstrass preparation theorem.

==Applications==
Formal power series can be used to solve recurrences occurring in number theory and combinatorics. For an example involving finding a closed form expression for the Fibonacci numbers, see the article on Examples of generating functions.

One can use formal power series to prove several relations familiar from analysis in a purely algebraic setting. Consider for instance the following elements of formula_242:

:formula_243
:formula_244

Then one can show that

:formula_245
:formula_246
:formula_247

The last one being valid in the ring formula_248

For &quot;K&quot; a field, the ring formula_249 is often used as the &quot;standard, most general&quot; complete local ring over &quot;K&quot; in algebra.

==Interpreting formal power series as functions==

In mathematical analysis, every convergent power series defines a function with values in the real or complex numbers. Formal power series over certain special rings can also be interpreted as functions, but one has to be careful with the domain and codomain. Let

:formula_250

and suppose formula_111 is a commutative associative algebra over formula_5, formula_92 is an ideal in formula_111 such that the I-adic topology on formula_111 is complete, and formula_4 is an element of formula_92. Define:

:formula_258

This series is guaranteed to converge in formula_111 given the above assumptions on formula_4. Furthermore, we have

:formula_261

and

:formula_262

Unlike in the case of bona fide functions, these formulas are not definitions but have to be proved.

Since the topology on formula_23 is the formula_264-adic topology and formula_23 is complete, we can in particular apply power series to other power series, provided that the arguments don&#x27;t have constant coefficients (so that they belong to the ideal formula_264): formula_267, formula_268 and formula_269 are all well defined for any formal power series formula_270

With this formalism, we can give an explicit formula for the multiplicative inverse of a power series formula_151 whose constant coefficient formula_272 is invertible in formula_5:

:formula_274

If the formal power series formula_152 with formula_276 is given implicitly by the equation

:formula_277

where formula_151 is a known power series with formula_279, then the coefficients of formula_152 can be explicitly computed using the Lagrange inversion formula.

==Generalizations==

=== Formal Laurent series ===
The formal Laurent series over a ring formula_5 are defined in a similar way to a formal power series, except that we also allow finitely many terms of negative degree. That is, they are the series that can be written as

:formula_282

for some integer formula_283, so that there are only finitely many negative formula_18 with formula_285. (This is different from the classical Laurent series of complex analysis.) For a non-zero formal Laurent series, the minimal integer formula_18 such that formula_287 is called the &quot;order&quot; of formula_151 and is denoted formula_289 (The order ord(0) of the zero series is formula_290.)

Multiplication of such series can be defined. Indeed, similarly to the definition for formal power series, the coefficient of formula_291 of two series with respective sequences of coefficients formula_292 and formula_293 is
formula_294
This sum has only finitely many nonzero terms because of the assumed vanishing of coefficients at sufficiently negative indices.

The formal Laurent series form the ring of formal Laurent series over formula_5, denoted by formula_296. It is equal to the localization of the ring formula_23 of formal power series with respect to the set of positive powers of formula_43. If formula_144 is a field, then formula_300 is in fact a field, which may alternatively be obtained as the field of fractions of the integral domain formula_146.

As with formula_23, the ring formula_296 of formal Laurent series may be endowed with the structure of a topological ring by introducing the metric
formula_304
(In particular, formula_305 implies that formula_306

One may define formal differentiation for formal Laurent series in the natural (term-by-term) way. Precisely, the formal derivative of the formal Laurent series formula_151 above is
formula_308
which is again a formal Laurent series. If formula_151 is a non-constant formal Laurent series and with coefficients in a field of characteristic 0, then one has
formula_310
However, in general this is not the case since the factor formula_18 for the lowest order term could be equal to 0 in formula_5.

====Formal residue====
Assume that formula_237 is a field of characteristic 0. Then the map

:formula_314

defined above is a formula_237-derivation that satisfies

:formula_316
:formula_317

The latter shows that the coefficient of formula_318 in formula_151 is of particular interest; it is called &quot;formal residue of formula_151&quot; and denoted formula_321. The map

:formula_322

is formula_237-linear, and by the above observation one has an exact sequence

:formula_324

Some rules of calculus. As a quite direct consequence of the above definition, and of the rules of formal derivation, one has, for any formula_325
Property (i) is part of the exact sequence above. Property (ii) follows from (i) as applied to formula_326. Property (iii): any formula_151 can be written in the form formula_328, with formula_329 and formula_330: then formula_331 formula_330 implies formula_152 is invertible in formula_334 whence formula_335 Property (iv): Since formula_336 we can write formula_337 with formula_338. Consequently, formula_339 and (iv) follows from (i) and (iii). Property (v) is clear from the definition.

===The Lagrange inversion formula===

As mentioned above, any formal series formula_340 with &quot;f&quot;0 = 0 and &quot;f&quot;1 ≠ 0 has a composition inverse formula_341 The following relation between the coefficients of &quot;gn&quot; and &quot;f&quot;−&quot;k&quot; holds (&quot;&quot;):

:formula_342

In particular, for &quot;n&quot; = 1 and all &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1,

:formula_343

Since the proof of the Lagrange inversion formula is a very short computation, it is worth reporting one residue-based proof here (a number of different proofs exist, using, e.g., Cauchy&#x27;s coefficient formula for holomorphic functions, tree-counting arguments, or induction). Noting formula_344, we can apply the rules of calculus above, crucially Rule (iv) substituting formula_345, to get:

:formula_346

Generalizations. One may observe that the above computation can be repeated plainly in more general settings than &quot;K&quot;((&quot;X&quot;)): a generalization of the Lagrange inversion formula is already available working in the formula_347-modules formula_348 where α is a complex exponent. As a consequence, if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are as above, with formula_349, we can relate the complex powers of &quot;f&quot; / &quot;X&quot; and &quot;g&quot; / &quot;X&quot;: precisely, if α and β are non-zero complex numbers with negative integer sum, formula_350 then

:formula_351

For instance, this way one finds the power series for complex powers of the Lambert function.

=== Power series in several variables ===
Formal power series in any number of indeterminates (even infinitely many) can be defined. If &quot;I&quot; is an index set and &quot;XI&quot; is the set of indeterminates &quot;Xi&quot; for &quot;i&quot;∈&quot;I&quot;, then a monomial &quot;X&quot;&quot;α&quot; is any finite product of elements of &quot;XI&quot; (repetitions allowed); a formal power series in &quot;XI&quot; with coefficients in a ring &quot;R&quot; is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials &quot;X&quot;&quot;α&quot; to a corresponding coefficient &quot;c&quot;&quot;α&quot;, and is denoted formula_352. The set of all such formal power series is denoted formula_353 and it is given a ring structure by defining

:formula_354

and

:formula_355

==== Topology ====
The topology on formula_356 is such that a sequence of its elements converges only if for each monomial &quot;X&quot;α the corresponding coefficient stabilizes. If &quot;I&quot; is finite, then this the &quot;J&quot;-adic topology, where &quot;J&quot; is the ideal of formula_356 generated by all the indeterminates in &quot;XI&quot;. This does not hold if &quot;I&quot; is infinite. For example, if formula_358 then the sequence formula_359 with formula_360 does not converge with respect to any &quot;J&quot;-adic topology on &quot;R&quot;, but clearly for each monomial the corresponding coefficient stabilizes.

As remarked above, the topology on a repeated formal power series ring like formula_361 is usually chosen in such a way that it becomes isomorphic as a topological ring to formula_362

====Operations====
All of the operations defined for series in one variable may be extended to the several variables case.

* A series is invertible if and only if its constant term is invertible in &quot;R&quot;.
* The composition &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) of two series &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is defined if &quot;f&quot; is a series in a single indeterminate, and the constant term of &quot;g&quot; is zero. For a series &quot;f&quot; in several indeterminates a form of &quot;composition&quot; can similarly be defined, with as many separate series in the place of &quot;g&quot; as there are indeterminates.

In the case of the formal derivative, there are now separate partial derivative operators, which differentiate with respect to each of the indeterminates. They all commute with each other.

==== Universal property ====
In the several variables case, the universal property characterizing formula_363 becomes the following. If &quot;S&quot; is a commutative associative algebra over &quot;R&quot;, if &quot;I&quot; is an ideal of &quot;S&quot; such that the &quot;I&quot;-adic topology on &quot;S&quot; is complete, and if &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;xr&quot; are elements of &quot;I&quot;, then there is a &quot;unique&quot; map formula_364 with the following properties:

* Φ is an &quot;R&quot;-algebra homomorphism
* Φ is continuous
* Φ(&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;r&quot;.

===Non-commuting variables===
The several variable case can be further generalised by taking &quot;non-commuting variables&quot; &quot;Xi&quot; for &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;, where &quot;I&quot; is an index set and then a monomial &quot;X&quot;α is any word in the &quot;XI&quot;; a formal power series in &quot;XI&quot; with coefficients in a ring &quot;R&quot; is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials &quot;X&quot;α to a corresponding coefficient &quot;c&quot;α, and is denoted formula_365. The set of all such formal power series is denoted &quot;R&quot;«&quot;XI&quot;», and it is given a ring structure by defining addition pointwise

:formula_366

and multiplication by

:formula_367

where · denotes concatenation of words. These formal power series over &quot;R&quot; form the Magnus ring over &quot;R&quot;.

=== On a semiring ===
Given an alphabet formula_368 and a semiring formula_111. The formal power series over formula_111 supported on the language formula_371 is denoted by formula_372. It consists of all mappings formula_373, where formula_371 is the free monoid generated by the non-empty set formula_368.

The elements of formula_372 can be written as formal sums

:formula_377

where formula_378 denotes the value of formula_379 at the word formula_380. The elements formula_381 are called the coefficients of formula_379.

For formula_383 the support of formula_379 is the set

:formula_385

A series where every coefficient is either formula_386 or formula_387 is called the characteristic series of its support.

The subset of formula_372 consisting of all series with a finite support is denoted by formula_389 and called polynomials.

For formula_390 and formula_391, the sum formula_392 is defined by 
:formula_393
The (Cauchy) product formula_394 is defined by
:formula_395
The Hadamard product formula_396 is defined by
:formula_397
And the products by a scalar formula_398 and formula_399 by
:formula_400 and formula_401, respectively.

With these operations formula_402 and formula_403 are semirings, where formula_404 is the empty word in formula_371.

These formal power series are used to model the behavior of weighted automata, in theoretical computer science, when the coefficients formula_378 of the series are taken to be the weight of a path with label formula_407 in the automata.

===Replacing the index set by an ordered abelian group===
Suppose formula_408 is an ordered abelian group, meaning an abelian group with a total ordering formula_409 respecting the group&#x27;s addition, so that formula_410. Let I be a well-ordered subset of formula_408, meaning I contains no infinite descending chain. Consider the set consisting of

:formula_412

for all such I, with formula_413 in a commutative ring formula_5, where we assume that for any index set, if all of the formula_413 are zero then the sum is zero. Then formula_416 is the ring of formal power series on formula_408; because of the condition that the indexing set be well-ordered the product is well-defined, and we of course assume that two elements which differ by zero are the same. Sometimes the notation formula_418 is used to denote formula_416.

Various properties of formula_5 transfer to formula_416. If formula_5 is a field, then so is formula_416. If formula_5 is an ordered field, we can order formula_416 by setting any element to have the same sign as its leading coefficient, defined as the least element of the index set I associated to a non-zero coefficient. Finally if formula_408 is a divisible group and formula_5 is a real closed field, then formula_416 is a real closed field, and if formula_5 is algebraically closed, then so is formula_416.

This theory is due to Hans Hahn, who also showed that one obtains subfields when the number of (non-zero) terms is bounded by some fixed infinite cardinality.

<text>Several waves of European seafarers sailed the edges of the Australia. Dutch navigators were the first Europeans known to have explored and mapped the Australian coastline. The first documented encounter was that of Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon, in 1606. Dutch seafarers also visited the west and north coasts of the continent, as did French explorers.

The most famous expedition was that of Royal Navy Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook 164 years after Janszoon&#x27;s sighting. After an assignment to make observations of the 1769 Transit of Venus, Cook followed Admiralty instructions to explore the south Pacific for the reported &quot;Terra Australis&quot; and on 19 April 1770 sighted the south-eastern coast of Australia and became the first recorded European to explore the eastern coastline. Explorers by land and sea continued to survey the continent for some years after settlement.

==Pro-Iberian hypotheses and theories==
Some writers have advanced the theory that the Portuguese were the first Europeans to sight Australia in the 1520s.

A number of relics and remains have been interpreted as evidence that the Portuguese reached Australia. The primary evidence advanced to support this theory is the representation of the continent of Jave la Grande, which appears on a series of French world maps, the Dieppe maps, and that may, in part, be based on Portuguese charts. However, most historians do not accept this theory, and the interpretation of the Dieppe maps is highly contentious. In the early 20th century, Lawrence Hargrave argued that Spain had established a colony in Botany Bay in the 16th century. Five coins from the Kilwa Sultanate were found on Marchinbar Island, in the Wessel Islands in 1945 by RAAF radar operator Morry Isenberg. In 2018 another coin, also thought to be from Kilwa, was found on a beach on Elcho Island, another of the Wessel Islands, by archaeologist and member of the Past Masters, Mike Hermes. Hermes speculated that the coins may suggest trade between indigenous Australians and Kilwa, or may have arrived via Makassan contact with Australia. Mike Owen, another member of the Past Masters group speculated that these coins may have arrived sometime after they had installed Muhammad Arcone on the Kilwa throne as a Portuguese vassal, from 1505 to 1506, or that the Portuguese had visited Wessel islands.

The French navigator Binot Paulmier de Gonneville claimed to have landed at a land he described as &quot;east of the Cape of Good Hope&quot; in 1504, after being blown off course. For some time it had been thought he landed in Australia, but the place he landed has now been shown to be Brazil (which is north-west of the Cape).

==17th century==
===Dutch exploration===

The most significant exploration of Australia in the 17th century was by the Dutch. The Dutch East India Company (, &quot;VOC&quot;, &quot;United East India Company&quot;) was set up in 1602 and traded extensively with the islands which now form parts of Indonesia, and hence were very close to Australia already.

The first documented and undisputed European sighting of and landing on Australia was in late February 1606, by the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon aboard the &quot;Duyfken.&quot; Janszoon charted the Australian coast and met with Aboriginal people. Janszoon followed the coast of New Guinea, missed Torres Strait, and explored and then charted part of the western side of Cape York, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, believing the land was still part of New Guinea. On 26 February 1606, Janszoon and his party made landfall near the modern town of Weipa and the Pennefather River, but were promptly attacked by the Indigenous people. Janszoon proceeded down the coast for some . He stopped in some places, but was met by hostile natives and some of his men were killed. At the final place, he initially had friendly relations with the natives, but after he forced them to hunt for him and appropriated some of their women, violence broke out and there were many deaths on both sides. These events were recorded in Aboriginal oral history that has come down to the present day. Here Janszoon decided to turn back, the place later being called Cape Keerweer, Dutch for &quot;turnabout&quot;.

That same year, a Spanish expedition sailing in nearby waters and led by Pedro Fernández de Quiros landed in the New Hebrides and, believing such to be the fabled &quot;southern continent&quot;, named the land &quot;Austrialia del Espiritu Santo&quot; (&quot;Southern Land of the Holy Spirit&quot;), in honour of his queen Margaret of Austria, the wife of Philip III of Spain. Later that year, De Quiros&#x27; deputy Luís Vaez de Torres sailed to the north of Australia through Torres Strait, charting New Guinea&#x27;s southern coast, and possibly sighting Cape York in October 1606.

In 1611 Hendrik Brouwer, working for VOC, discovered that sailing from Europe to Batavia was much quicker if the Roaring Forties were used. Up to that point, the Dutch had followed a route copied from Arab and Portuguese sailors who followed the coasts of Africa, Mauritius and Ceylon. The Brouwer Route involved sailing south from the Cape of Good Hope (which is at 34° latitude south) into the Roaring Forties (at 40–50° latitude south), then sailing east before turning north to Java using the South Indian Ocean Current. The Brouwer Route became compulsory for Dutch vessels in 1617. The problem with the route, however, was that there was no easy way at the time to determine longitude, making Dutch landfalls on the west coast of Australia inevitable, as well as ships becoming wrecked on the shoals. Most of these landfalls were unplanned. The first such landfall was in 1616, when Dirk Hartog, employed by VOC, reached land at Shark Bay (on what is now called Dirk Hartog Island) off the coast of Western Australia. Finding nothing of interest, Hartog continued sailing northwards along this coastline of Western Australia previously unknown to Europeans, making nautical charts up to about 22° latitude south. He then left the coast and continued on to Batavia. He called Australia shortened to Eendrachtslandafter his ship, a name which would be in use until Abel Tasman named the land New Holland in 1644.

In 1619 Frederik de Houtman, in the VOC ship &quot;Dordrecht&quot;, and Jacob d&#x27;Edel, in another VOC ship &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, sighted land on the Australian coast near present-day Perth which they called &quot;d&#x27;Edelsland&quot;. After sailing northwards along the coast they made landfall in &quot;Eendrachtsland&quot;, which had previous been encountered and named by Hartog, before turning for Batavia.

Hessel Gerritsz was appointed on 16 October 1617 as the first exclusive cartographer of VOC, whose job included creating and maintaining charts of coastlines in the area. Gerritsz produced a map in 1622 which showed the first part of Australia to be charted, that by Janszoon in 1606. It was considered to be part of New Guinea and called &quot;Nueva Guinea&quot; on the map, but Gerritsz also added an inscription saying: 
:&quot;Those who sailed with the yacht of Pedro Fernandes de Queirós in the neighbourhood of New Guinea to 10 degrees westward through many islands and shoals and over 2, 3 and 4 fathoms for as many as 40 days, presumed that New Guinea did not extend beyond 10 degrees to the south. If this be so, then the land from 9 to 14 degrees would be a separate land, different from the other New Guinea&quot;.

All charts and logs from returning VOC merchants and explorer sailors had to be submitted to Gerritsz and provided new information for several breakthrough maps which came from his hands. Gerritsz&#x27; charts would accompany all VOC captains on their voyages. In 1627 Gerritsz made a map, the Caert van&#x27;t Landt van d&#x27;Eendracht, entirely devoted to the discoveries of the West Australian coastline, which was named &quot;Eendrachtsland&quot;, though the name had been used since 1619.

On 1 May 1622, Englishman John Brooke in the &quot;Tryall&quot;, a British East India Company owned vessel of approximately 500 tons, on the way to Batavia made the second English voyage to use Brouwer&#x27;s southern route. He sailed too far east and sighted the coastline of Western Australia at Point Cloates (about 22° latitude south), although he mistook it for an island sighted in 1618 by Janszoon (and in 1816 named Barrow Island by Phillip Parker King). They did not land there, and a few weeks later were shipwrecked on an uncharted reef northwest of the Montebello Islands (about 20° latitude south, now known as Tryal Rocks). The shipwreck caused the deaths of 93 men, but Brooke, his son John and nine men scrambled into a skiff and the ship&#x27;s factor Thomas Bright and 35 others managed to save a longboat. Brooke sailed separately to Java. Bright and his crew spent seven days ashore on the Montebello Islands, before sailing the longboat to Bantam in Java. This was the first recorded shipwreck in Australian waters and first extended stay in Australia by Europeans.

In March 1622, the Dutch galleon Leeuwin, captained by Jan Fransz, mapped parts of the Australian coast between Hamelin Bay and Point D&#x27;Entrecasteaux. This was the first European vessel to round what is now called Cape Leeuwin.
In 1623, Jan Carstensz was commissioned by VOC to lead an expedition to the southern coast of New Guinea and beyond, to follow up the reports of further land sighted by Janszoon in his 1606 voyages to the south. Setting off from Amboyna in the Dutch East Indies with two ships, the &quot;Pera&quot; and &quot;Arnhem&quot; (captained by Willem Joosten Van Colster), he traveled along the south coast of New Guinea, then headed south to Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf of Carpentaria. On 14 April 1623, he passed Cape Keerweer. Landing in search of fresh water for his stores, Carstensz encountered a party of the local indigenous Australian inhabitants, who he described as &quot;poor and miserable looking people&quot; who had &quot;no knowledge of precious metals or spices&quot;. On 8 May 1623, Carstensz and his crew fought a skirmish with 200 Aborigines at the mouth of a small river near Cape Duyfken (named after Janszoon&#x27;s vessel which had earlier visited the region) and landed at the Pennefather River. Carstensz named the small river Carpentier River, and the Gulf of Carpentaria in honour of Pieter de Carpentier, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Carstensz reached the Staaten River before heading north again. The &quot;Pera&quot; and Carstensz returned to Amboyna while the &quot;Arnhem&quot; crossed the Gulf of Carpentaria, sighting the east coast of Arnhem Land.

In 1627, François Thijssen ended up too far south and on 26 January 1627 he came upon the coast of Australia, near Cape Leeuwin, the most south-west tip of the mainland. Pieter Nuyts the VOC official aboard his ship gave Thijssen permission to continue to sail eastwards, mapping more than of the southern coast of Australia from Albany, Western Australia to Ceduna, South Australia. He called the land (&quot;The Land of Pieter Nuyts&quot;). Part of Thijssen&#x27;s map shows the islands St Francis and St Peter, now known collectively with their respective groups as the Nuyts Archipelago. Thijssen&#x27;s observations were included as early as 1628 by Gerritsz in a chart of the Indies and Eendrachtsland

One Dutch captain of this period who was not really an explorer but who nevertheless bears mentioning was Francisco Pelsaert, captain of the &quot;Batavia&quot;, which was wrecked off the coast of Western Australia in 1629.

In August 1642, VOC despatched Abel Tasman and Franchoijs Visscher on a voyage of which one of the objects was to obtain knowledge of &quot;all the totally unknown provinces of the kingdom of Beach&quot;. This expedition used two small ships, the &quot;Heemskerck&quot; and the &quot;Zeehaen&quot;. Starting in Mauritius both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. On 7 November, because of snow and hail the ships&#x27; course was altered to a more north-eastern direction. On 24 November 1642 Abel Tasman sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen&#x27;s Land after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east, Tasman then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island where he was blown out to sea by a storm, this area he named Storm Bay. Two days later Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. Tasman then landed in Blackman Bay – in the larger Marion Bay. The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay; however, because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag in North Bay. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.

In 1644 Tasman made a second voyage with three ships (, , and the tender ). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards, missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, and continued his voyage westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on the land, which he called New Holland, and its people. From the point of view of the Dutch East India Company, Tasman&#x27;s explorations were a disappointment: he had found neither a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route.

By the end of the Renaissance (1450 to 1650), every continent had been visited and mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known as Antarctica, but originally called Terra Australis, or &#x27;Australia&#x27; for short. This geographical achievement was displayed on the large world map &quot;Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula&quot; made by the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1648 to commemorate the Peace of Westphalia.
A map of the world inlaid into the floor of the (&quot;Burger&#x27;s Hall&quot;) of the new Amsterdam (&quot;Town Hall&quot;) in 1648 revealed the extent of Dutch charts of much of Australia&#x27;s coast. Based on Joan Blaeu&#x27;s (&quot;A New and Most Accurate Chart of the Sphere of the Earth&quot;) of the same year, it incorporated Tasman&#x27;s discoveries. Although the original mosaic was worn flat, it was reproduced in 1748. This reproduction was left in storage for centuries before being restored after World War II as part of the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. It was also used as the basis of another mosaic in Canberra, focused specifically on the Australian section of the map of the eastern hemisphere. Tasman&#x27;s discoveries also subsequently appeared on the (&quot;Eastern or Asiatic Archipelago&quot;) published in the (&quot;Atlas of the Great Elector&quot;).

Maps from this period and the early 18th century often have or (&quot;the South Land&quot;) marked as &quot;New Holland&quot;, the name given to the continent by Abel Tasman in 1644. Joan Blaeu&#x27;s 1659 map shows the clearly recognizable outline of Australia based on the many Dutch explorations of the first half of the 17th century.
In 1664, the French geographer Melchisédech Thévenot published his (&quot;Relations of Various Interesting Voyages&quot;), including a map of New Holland. Thévenot divided the continent in two, between to the west and (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) to the east. He divided the continent on a line at longitude 135° east, which appears to have been on his initiative, as there was no such division in Tasman&#x27;s journals or on his, Blaeu&#x27;s, or Amsterdam Burgerzaal&#x27;s maps or on any other Dutch maps of this period. Instead, or appearedif at allas alternative names with in reference to the whole island. This 135° E. line seems to have represented Thévenot&#x27;s understanding of the Zaragoza Meridian or Tordesillas antimeridian, dividing the Portuguese East Indies conquered by the Dutch Empire in a protracted conflict across the 17th century from the lands reserved under those treaties for the Spanish Empire and reclaimed by the act of possession of &quot;Austrialia&quot; carried out by Pedro Fernández de Quirós in 1606. This western limit of Spain&#x27;s claim is shown on the 1761 map of the Spanish Empire by Vicente de Memije, (&quot;Symbolic Presentation of the Spanish World&quot;) and played a part in the British claim and division of the territory during the establishment of New South Wales in the late 18th century and Western Australia in the early 19th century.

In 1696, Willem de Vlamingh commanded the rescue mission to Australia&#x27;s west coast to look for survivors of the &quot;Ridderschap van Holland&quot; that had gone missing two years earlier. The mission proved fruitless, but along the way Vlamingh charted parts of the continent&#x27;s western coast and as a result improved navigation on the Indian Ocean route from the Cape of Good Hope to the Dutch East Indies.

===Others===
Englishman William Dampier came looking for the &quot;Tryall&quot; in 1688, 66 years after it was wrecked. Dampier was the first Englishman to set foot on the Australian mainland on 5 January 1688, when his ship the &quot;Cygnet&quot; was marooned in King Sound. While the ship was being careened he made notes on the fauna and flora and the indigenous peoples he found there. He made another voyage to the region in 1699, before returning to England. He described some of the flora and fauna of Australia, and was the first European to report Australia&#x27;s peculiar large hopping animals. Dampier contributed to knowledge of Australia&#x27;s coastline through his two-volume publication &quot;A Voyage to New Holland&quot; (1703, 1709). His book of adventures, &quot;A New Voyage around the World&quot;, created a sensation when it was published in English in 1697. Though he was briefly marooned on the northwest Australian coast on the trip described in this book, only his second voyage seems to be of importance to Australian exploration.

==18th century==
In 1756, French King Louis XV sent Louis Antoine de Bougainville to look for the Southern lands. After a stay in South America and the Falklands, Bougainville reached Tahiti in April 1768, where his boat was surrounded by hundreds of canoes filled with beautiful women. &quot;I ask you&quot;, he wrote, &quot;given such a spectacle, how could one keep at work 400 Frenchmen?&quot; He claimed Tahiti for the French and sailed westward, past southern Samoa and the New Hebrides, then on sighting Espiritu Santo turned west still looking for the &quot;Southern Continent&quot;. On June 4 he almost ran into heavy breakers and had to change course to the north and east. He had almost found the Great Barrier Reef. He sailed through what is now known as the Solomon Islands that, due to the hostility of the people there, he avoided, until his passage was blocked by a mighty reef. With his men weak from scurvy and disease and no way through he sailed for Batavia in the Dutch East Indies where he received news of Wallis and Carteret who had preceded Bougainville. When he returned to France in 1769, he was the first Frenchman to circumnavigate the globe and the first European known to have seen the Great Barrier Reef. Though he did not reach the mainland of Australia, he did eliminate a considerable area where the Southern land was not.

In the meantime, in 1768, British Lieutenant James Cook was sent from England on an expedition to the Pacific Ocean to observe the transit of Venus from Tahiti, sailing westwards in via Cape Horn and arriving there in 1769. On the return voyage he continued his explorations of the South Pacific, in search of the postulated continent of Terra Australis. He first reached New Zealand, and then sailed further westwards to sight the south-eastern corner of the Australian continent on 20 April 1770. In doing so, he was to be the first documented European expedition to reach the eastern coastline of Australia. He continued sailing northwards along the east coast, charting and naming many features along the way. He identified Botany Bay as a good harbour and one potentially suitable for a settlement, and where he made his first landfall on 29 April. Continuing up the coastline, the &quot;Endeavour&quot; was to later run aground on shoals of the Great Barrier Reef (near the present-day site of Cooktown), where she had to be laid up for repairs. The voyage then recommenced, eventually reaching the Torres Strait. At Possession Island Cook formally claimed possession of the entire east coast he had just explored for Britain. The expedition returned to England via the Indian Ocean and Cape of Good Hope.

In 1772, two French expeditions set out to find Terra Australis. The first was led by Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne who found and named the Crozet Islands. He spent a few days in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) where he made contact with the island&#x27;s indigenous people (the first European to have done so). In Blackmans Bay he claimed Van Diemen&#x27;s Land for France. He then sailed on to New Zealand where he and some crewmen were killed by Māori warriors. The survivors retreated to Mauritius. Also in 1772, the two ships of the second French expedition were separated by a storm. The leader turned back but the second in command, Louis Aleno de St Aloüarn, sighted Cape Leeuwin and followed the Western Australian coast north to Shark Bay. He landed on Dirk Hartog Island and claimed Western Australia in the name of French King Louis XV.

Tobias Furneaux on accompanied James Cook (in ) on Cook&#x27;s second voyage (1772–1775), which was commissioned by the British government with advice from the Royal Society, to circumnavigate the globe as far south as possible to finally determine whether there was any great southern landmass, or Terra Australis. On this expedition Furneaux was twice separated from his leader. On the first occasion, in 1773, Furneaux explored a great part of the south and east coasts of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, and made the earliest British chart of the same. Most of his names here have survived. On Cook&#x27;s third voyage (1776–80), in 1777 Cook confirmed Furneaux&#x27;s account and delineation of it, with certain minor criticisms and emendations, and named after him the Furneaux Group at the eastern entrance to Bass Strait, and the group now known as the Low Archipelago.

Cook&#x27;s first expedition carried botanist Joseph Banks, for whom a great many Australian geographical features and the plant genus &quot;Banksia&quot; and a number of plant species, e.g. &quot;Grevillea banksii&quot;, were named. The reports of Cook and Banks in conjunction with the loss of England&#x27;s penal colonies in America after they gained independence and growing concern over French activity in the Pacific, encouraged the foundation by the British of a colony at Botany Bay. The First Fleet led by Captain Arthur Phillip left England on 13 May 1787 to found a penal colony in Australia. It reached Botany Bay in mid-January 1788. Phillip had decided to move the settlement to Sydney Cove in Port Jackson, but the British ships were unable to leave Botany Bay until 26 January because of a tremendous gale.

Just as he was attempting to move the colony, on 24 January 1788 Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse arrived off Botany Bay. The French expedition consisted of two ships led by La Pérouse, the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and the &quot;Boussole&quot;, which were on the latest leg of a three-year voyage that had taken them from Brest, around Cape Horn, up the coast from Chile to California, north-west to Kamchatka, south-east to Easter Island, north-west to Macao, and on to the Philippines, the Friendly Isles, Hawaii and Norfolk Island. The gale also prevented La Pérouse&#x27;s ships from entering Botany Bay. Though amicably received, the French expedition was a troublesome matter for the British, as it showed the interest of France in the new land. To preempt a French claim to Norfolk Island, Phillip ordered Lieutenant Philip Gidley King to lead a party of 15 convicts and seven free men to take control of Norfolk Island. They arrived on 6 March 1788, while La Pérouse was still in Sydney.

The British received him courteously, and each captain, through their officers, offered the other any assistance and needed supplies. La Pérouse was 6 weeks in Port Jackson, where the French established an observatory, held Catholic masses, performed geological observations, and planted the first garden. Before leaving Sydney on 10 March, La Pérouse took the opportunity to send his journals, some charts and also some letters back to Europe with a British naval ship from the First Fleet—the &quot;Alexander&quot;. Neither La Pérouse, nor any of his men, were seen again. Fortunately the documents that he dispatched with the &quot;Alexander&quot; from the in-progress expedition were returned to Paris, where they were published.

In September 1791, the French Assembly decided to send an expedition in search of La Pérouse, and Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux was selected to command the expedition. In 1792, d&#x27;Entrecasteaux landed and named Esperance in Western Australia and made many more discoveries and named many other places. The expedition suffered many difficulties, with d&#x27;Entrecasteaux dying on 21 July 1793 of scurvy. On 18 February 1794 the expedition vessels were surrendered to the Dutch authorities in the East Indies so that the new French Republican Government could not profit by them. Élisabeth Rossel, the most senior surviving officer, sailed from Java in January 1795 on board a Dutch ship taking with him the expedition&#x27;s papers. The ship left Rossel at Table Bay but took the papers, but was captured by the British. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, all the expedition papers were returned to Rossel, who was thus able to publish a narrative of the whole enterprise. In 1808 Rossel published the detailed &quot;Voyage de d&#x27;Entrecasteaux, envoyé à la recherche de Lapérouse&quot; produced by Charles-François Beautemps-Beaupré. The atlas contains 39 charts, of which those of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land were the most detailed, and which remained the source of the English charts for many years. His expedition also resulted in the publication of the first general flora of New Holland.

==Later exploration from the sea==

In 1796 (after settlement), British Matthew Flinders with George Bass took a small open boat, the &quot;Tom Thumb 1&quot;, and explored some of the coastline south of Sydney. He suspected from this voyage that Tasmania was an island, and in 1798 Bass and he led an expedition to circumnavigate it and hence prove his theory. The sea between mainland Australia and Tasmania was named Bass Strait. One of the two major islands in Bass Strait was later named Flinders Island by Philip Parker King. Flinders returned to England in 1801.

Meantime, in October 1800, Frenchman Nicolas Baudin was selected to lead what has become known as the Baudin expedition to map the coast of Australia/New Holland. He had two ships, &quot;Géographe&quot; and &quot;Naturaliste&quot; captained by Jacques Hamelin, and was accompanied by nine zoologists and botanists, including Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour. He reached Australia in May 1801, being the first to explore and map a part of the southern coast of the continent. The scientific expedition was a great success, with more than 2500 new species described. The French also met Indigenous people and treated them with high respect. Many Western Australian places still have French names today from Baudin&#x27;s expedition (Peron Peninsula, Depuch Island, Geographe Bay, Cape Naturaliste, Cape Levillain, Boullanger Island and Faure Island). The Australian plant genus &quot;Lechenaultia&quot; is named after Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour and &quot;Guichenotia&quot; after Antoine Guichenot. In April 1802, the &quot;Le Naturaliste&quot; under Hamelin explored the area of Western Port, Victoria, and gave names to places, a number of which have survived. &quot;Ile des Français&quot; is now called French Island.

Flinders&#x27; work came to the attention of many of the scientists of the day, in particular the influential Sir Joseph Banks, to whom Flinders dedicated his &quot;Observations on the Coasts of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, on Bass&#x27;s Strait, etc.&quot;. Banks used his influence with Earl Spencer to convince the Admiralty of the importance of an expedition to chart the coastline of New Holland. As a result, in January 1801, Flinders was given command of , a 334-ton sloop, and promoted to commander the following month.

&quot;Investigator&quot; set sail for New Holland on 18 July 1801. Attached to the expedition was the botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, and landscape artist William Westall. Due to the scientific nature of the expedition, Flinders was issued with a French passport, despite England and France then being at war. Flinders first sailed along the south coast to Sydney, then completed the circumnavigation of Australia back to Sydney.
While each was charting Australia&#x27;s coastline, Baudin and Flinders met by chance in April 1802 in Encounter Bay in what is now South Australia. Baudin stopped at the settlement of Sydney for supplies. In Sydney he bought a new ship, the , a smaller vessel which could conduct close inshore survey work, under the command of Louis de Freycinet. He sent home the larger &quot;Naturaliste&quot; with all the specimens that had been collected by Baudin and his crew. He then headed for Tasmania and conducted further charting of Bass Strait before sailing west, following the west coast northward, and after another visit to Timor, undertook further exploration along the north coast of Australia. Plagued by contrary winds and ill health, it was decided on 7 July 1803 to return to France. The expedition stopped at Mauritius, where he died of tuberculosis on 16 September 1803. The expedition finally came back to France on 24 March 1804. According to researchers from the University of Adelaide, during this expedition Baudin prepared a report for Napoleon on ways to invade and capture the British colony at Sydney Cove.

The British suspected that the reason for Baudin&#x27;s expedition was to try to establish a French colony on the coast of New Holland. In response, the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; and the whaler &quot;Albion&quot;, both under direction of Lieutenant John Bowen, sailed from Port Jackson on 31 August 1803 to establish a settlement in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, and on 10 October 1803 a convoy of two ships and &quot;Ocean&quot; led by Captain David Collins carrying 402 people entered Port Phillip and formed a settlement near Sorrento. The first British to enter the bay were the crews of , commanded by John Murray and, ten weeks later, &quot;Investigator&quot;, commanded by Flinders, in 1802.

&quot;Investigator&quot; was declared unseaworthy, so in 1803 Flinders was compelled to return to England as a passenger on , together with his charts and logbooks. The vessel stopped in Mauritius, thinking that he would be safe because of the scientific nature of his voyages, though England and France were at war at the time. However, the governor of Mauritius kept Flinders in prison for six and a half years. As a consequence, the first published map of the full outline of Australia was the Freycinet Map of 1811, a product of Baudin&#x27;s expedition. It preceded the publication of Flinders&#x27; map of Australia, &quot;Terra Australis or Australia&quot;, by three years. Flinders also published in 1814 his account of the voyage in &quot;A Voyage to Terra Australis&quot;, which was published just before his death at the age of 40.

<doc id="60022" wikidata="Q2872" url="?curid=60022" title="Fractal compression">
<text>Fractal compression is a lossy compression method for digital images, based on fractals. The method is best suited for textures and natural images, relying on the fact that parts of an image often resemble other parts of the same image. Fractal algorithms convert these parts into mathematical data called &quot;fractal codes&quot; which are used to recreate the encoded image.

==Iterated function systems==
Fractal image representation may be described mathematically as an iterated function system (IFS).

===For binary images===
We begin with the representation of a binary image, where the image may be thought of as a subset of formula_1. An IFS is a set of contraction mappings &quot;ƒ&quot;1...,&quot;ƒN&quot;,

:formula_2

According to these mapping functions, the IFS describes a two-dimensional set &quot;S&quot; as the fixed point of the Hutchinson operator

:formula_3

That is, &quot;H&quot; is an operator mapping sets to sets, and &quot;S&quot; is the unique set satisfying &quot;H&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) = &quot;S&quot;. The idea is to construct the IFS such that this set &quot;S&quot; is the input binary image. The set &quot;S&quot; can be recovered from the IFS by fixed point iteration: for any nonempty compact initial set &quot;A&quot;0, the iteration &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 = &quot;H&quot;(&quot;Ak&quot;) converges to &quot;S&quot;.

The set &quot;S&quot; is self-similar because &quot;H&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) = &quot;S&quot; implies that &quot;S&quot; is a union of mapped copies of itself:
:formula_4
So we see the IFS is a fractal representation of &quot;S&quot;.

===Extension to grayscale===
IFS representation can be extended to a grayscale image by considering the image&#x27;s graph as a subset of formula_5. For a grayscale image &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), consider the set
&quot;S&quot; = {(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;))}. Then similar to the binary case, &quot;S&quot; is described by an IFS using a set of contraction mappings &quot;ƒ&quot;1...,&quot;ƒN&quot;, but in formula_5,

:formula_7

===Encoding===
A challenging problem of ongoing research in fractal image representation is how to choose the &quot;ƒ&quot;1...,&quot;ƒN&quot; such that its fixed point approximates the input image, and how to do this efficiently.

A simple approach for doing so is the following partitioned iterated function system (PIFS):

# Partition the image domain into range blocks &quot;Ri&quot; of size &quot;s&quot;×&quot;s&quot;.
# For each &quot;Ri&quot;, search the image to find a block &quot;Di&quot; of size 2&quot;s&quot;×2&quot;s&quot; that is very similar to &quot;Ri&quot;.
# Select the mapping functions such that &quot;H&quot;(&quot;Di&quot;) = &quot;Ri&quot; for each &quot;i&quot;.

In the second step, it is important to find a similar block so that the IFS accurately represents the input image, so a sufficient number of candidate blocks for &quot;Di&quot; need to be considered. On the other hand, a large search considering many blocks is computationally costly. 
This bottleneck of searching for similar blocks is why PIFS fractal encoding is much slower than for example DCT and wavelet based image representation.

The initial square partitioning and brute-force search algorithm presented by Jacquin provides a starting point for further research and extensions in many possible directions—different ways of partitioning the image into range blocks of various sizes and shapes; fast techniques for quickly finding a close-enough matching domain block for each range block rather than brute-force searching, such as fast motion estimation algorithms; different ways of encoding the mapping from the domain block to the range block; etc.

Other researchers attempt to find algorithms to automatically encode an arbitrary image as RIFS (recurrent iterated function systems) or global IFS, rather than PIFS; and algorithms for fractal video compression including motion compensation and three dimensional iterated function systems.

Fractal image compression has many similarities to vector quantization image compression.

==Features==
With fractal compression, encoding is extremely computationally expensive because of the search used to find the self-similarities. Decoding, however, is quite fast. While this asymmetry has so far made it impractical for real time applications, when video is archived for distribution from disk storage or file downloads fractal compression becomes more competitive.

At common compression ratios, up to about 50:1, fractal compression provides similar results to DCT-based algorithms such as JPEG. At high compression ratios fractal compression may offer superior quality. For satellite imagery, ratios of over 170:1 have been achieved with acceptable results. Fractal video compression ratios of 25:1–244:1 have been achieved in reasonable compression times (2.4 to 66 sec/frame).

Compression efficiency increases with higher image complexity and color depth, compared to simple grayscale images.

===Resolution independence and fractal scaling===
An inherent feature of fractal compression is that images become resolution independent after being converted to fractal code. This is because the iterated function systems in the compressed file scale indefinitely. This indefinite scaling property of a fractal is known as &quot;fractal scaling&quot;.

===Fractal interpolation===
The resolution independence of a fractal-encoded image can be used to increase the display resolution of an image. This process is also known as &quot;fractal interpolation&quot;. In fractal interpolation, an image is encoded into fractal codes via fractal compression, and subsequently decompressed at a higher resolution. The result is an up-sampled image in which iterated function systems have been used as the interpolant.
Fractal interpolation maintains geometric detail very well compared to traditional interpolation methods like bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation. Since the interpolation cannot reverse Shannon entropy however, it ends up sharpening the image by adding random instead of meaningful detail. One cannot, for example, enlarge an image of a crowd where each person&#x27;s face is one or two pixels and hope to identify them.

==History==
Michael Barnsley led the development of fractal compression from 1985 at the Georgia Institute of Technology (where both Barnsley and Sloan were professors in the mathematics department). The work was sponsored by DARPA and the Georgia Tech Research Corporation. The project resulted in several patents from 1987. Barnsley&#x27;s graduate student Arnaud Jacquin implemented the first automatic algorithm in software in 1992. All methods are based on the fractal transform using iterated function systems. Michael Barnsley and Alan Sloan formed Iterated Systems Inc. in 1987 which was granted over 20 additional patents related to fractal compression.

A major breakthrough for Iterated Systems Inc. was the automatic fractal transform process which eliminated the need for human intervention during compression as was the case in early experimentation with fractal compression technology. In 1992, Iterated Systems Inc. received a US$2.1 million government grant to develop a prototype digital image storage and decompression chip using fractal transform image compression technology.

Fractal image compression has been used in a number of commercial applications: onOne Software, developed under license from Iterated Systems Inc., Genuine Fractals 5 which is a Photoshop plugin capable of saving files in compressed FIF (Fractal Image Format). To date the most successful use of still fractal image compression is by Microsoft in its Encarta multimedia encyclopedia, also under license.

Iterated Systems Inc. supplied a shareware encoder (Fractal Imager), a stand-alone decoder, a Netscape plug-in decoder and a development package for use under Windows. The redistribution of the &quot;decompressor DLL&quot; provided by the ColorBox III SDK was governed by restrictive per-disk or year-by-year licensing regimes for proprietary software vendors and by a discretionary scheme that entailed the promotion of the Iterated Systems products for certain classes of other users.

ClearVideo also known as RealVideo (Fractal) and SoftVideo were early fractal video compression products. ClearFusion was Iterated&#x27;s freely distributed streaming video plugin for web browsers. In 1994 SoftVideo was licensed to Spectrum Holobyte for use in its CD-ROM games including Falcon Gold and Star Trek: The Next Generation A Final Unity.

In 1996, Iterated Systems Inc. announced an alliance with the Mitsubishi Corporation to market ClearVideo to their Japanese customers. The original ClearVideo 1.2 decoder driver is still supported by Microsoft in Windows Media Player although the encoder is no longer supported.

Two firms, Total Multimedia Inc. and Dimension, both claim to own or have the exclusive licence to Iterated&#x27;s video technology, but neither has yet released a working product. The technology basis appears to be Dimension&#x27;s U.S. patents 8639053 and 8351509, which have been considerably analyzed. In summary, it is a simple quadtree block-copying system with neither the bandwidth efficiency nor PSNR quality of traditional DCT-based codecs. In January 2016, TMMI announced that it was abandoning fractal-based technology altogether.

Research papers between 1997 and 2007 discussed possible solutions to improve fractal algorithms and encoding hardware.

==Implementations==
A library called &quot;Fiasco&quot; was created by Ullrich Hafner. In 2001, &quot;Fiasco&quot; was covered in the &quot;Linux Journal&quot;.

According to the 2000-04 &quot;Fiasco&quot; manual, &quot;Fiasco&quot; can be used for video compression.

The Netpbm library includes the &quot;Fiasco&quot; library.
Femtosoft developed an implementation of fractal image compression in Object Pascal and Java.

<text>An airbag is a vehicle occupant-restraint system using a bag designed to inflate in milliseconds during a collision and then deflate afterwards. It consists of an airbag cushion, a flexible fabric bag, an inflation module, and an impact sensor. The purpose of the airbag is to provide a vehicle occupant with soft cushioning and restraint during a collision. It can reduce injuries between the flailing occupant and the vehicle&#x27;s interior.

The airbag provides an energy-absorbing surface between the vehicle&#x27;s occupants and a steering wheel, instrument panel, body pillar, headliner, and windshield. Modern vehicles may contain up to ten airbag modules in various configurations, including driver, passenger, side-curtain, seat-mounted, door-mounted, B and C-pillar mounted side-impact, knee bolster, inflatable seat belt, and pedestrian airbag modules.

During a crash, the vehicle&#x27;s crash sensors provide crucial information to the airbag electronic controller unit (ECU), including collision type, angle, and severity of impact. Using this information, the airbag ECU&#x27;s crash algorithm determines if the crash event meets the criteria for deployment and triggers various firing circuits to deploy one or more airbag modules within the vehicle. Airbag module deployments are activated through a pyrotechnic process designed to be used once as a supplemental restraint system for the vehicle&#x27;s seat belt systems. Newer side-impact airbag modules consist of compressed-air cylinders that are triggered in the event of a side-on vehicle impact.

The first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the 1970s, with limited success and caused some fatalities. Broad commercial adoption of airbags occurred in many markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Many modern vehicles now include six or more units.

== Active vs. passive safety ==
Airbags are considered &quot;passive&quot; restraints and act as a supplement to &quot;active&quot; restraints. Because no action by a vehicle occupant is required to activate or use the airbag, it is considered a &quot;passive&quot; device. This is in contrast to seat belts, which are considered &quot;active&quot; devices because the vehicle occupant must act to enable them.

This terminology is not related to active and passive safety, which are, respectively, systems designed to prevent collisions in the first place, and systems designed to minimize the effects of collisions once they occur. In this use, a car Anti-lock braking system qualifies as an active-safety device, while both its seat belts and airbags qualify as passive-safety devices. Terminological confusion can arise from the fact that passive devices and systems—those requiring no input or action by the vehicle occupant—can operate independently in an active manner; an airbag is one such device. Vehicle safety professionals are generally careful in their use of language to avoid this sort of confusion. However, advertising principles sometimes prevent such semantic caution in the consumer marketing of safety features. Further confusing the terminology, the aviation safety community uses the terms &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; in the &quot;opposite&quot; sense from the automotive industry.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The airbag &quot;for the covering of aeroplane and other vehicle parts&quot; traces its origins to a United States patent, submitted in 1919 by two dentists from Birmingham, Arthur Parrott and Harold Round. The patent was approved in 1920. Air-filled bladders were in use as early as 1951. The airbag specifically for automobile use is credited independently to the American John W. Hetrick, who filed for an airbag patent on 5 August 1952, that was granted #2,649,311 by the United States Patent Office on 18 August 1953. German engineer Walter Linderer, who filed German patent #896,312 on 6 October 1951, was issued on 12 November 1953, approximately three months after American John Hetrick. The airbags proposed by Hetrick and Linderer were based on compressed air released by a spring, bumper contact, or by the driver. Later research during the 1960s showed that compressed air could not inflate the mechanical airbags fast enough to ensure maximum safety, leading to the current chemical and electrical airbags. In patent applications, manufacturers sometimes use the term &quot;inflatable occupant restraint systems&quot;.

Hetrick was an industrial engineer and member of the United States Navy. His airbag design, however, only came about when he combined his experiences working with navy torpedoes with his desire to protect his family on the road. Despite working with the major automobile manufacturers of his time, Hetrick was unable to attract investment. Although airbags are now required in every automobile sold in the United States, Hetrick&#x27;s 1951 patent filing serves as an example of a &quot;valuable&quot; invention with little economic value to its inventor. Its first commercial use was not implemented until after the patent expired in 1971, at which point the airbag was installed in a few experimental Ford cars.

In 1964, a Japanese automobile engineer, Yasuzaburou Kobori (小堀保三郎), started developing an airbag &quot;safety net&quot; system. His design harnessed an explosive to inflate an airbag, for which he was later awarded patents in 14 countries. He died in 1975, before seeing the widespread adoption of airbag systems.

In 1967, a breakthrough in developing airbag crash sensors came when Allen K. Breed invented a ball-in-tube mechanism for crash detection. Under his system, an electromechanical sensor with a steel ball attached to a tube by a magnet would inflate an airbag in under 30 milliseconds. A small explosion of sodium azide was used instead of compressed air during inflation for the first time. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler. A similar &quot;Auto-Ceptor&quot; crash-restraint, developed by the Eaton, Yale &amp; Towne company for Ford, was soon also offered as an automatic safety system in the United States, while the Italian Eaton-Livia company offered a variant with localized air cushions.

In the early 1970s, General Motors began offering cars equipped with airbags, initially in government fleet-purchased 1973 Chevrolet Impala sedans. These cars came with a 1974-style Oldsmobile instrument panel and a unique steering wheel that contained the driver-side airbag. Two of these cars were crash tested after 20 years and the airbags deployed perfectly. An early example of the airbag cars survives as of 2009. GM&#x27;s Oldsmobile Toronado was the first domestic U.S. vehicle to include a passenger airbag in 1973. General Motors marketed its first airbag modules under the &quot;Air Cushion Restraint System&quot; name, or ACRS. The automaker discontinued the option for its 1977 model year, citing a lack of consumer interest. Ford and GM then spent years lobbying against air-bag requirements, claiming that the devices were unfeasible and inappropriate. Chrysler made driver-side airbags standard on 1988 and 1989 models, but airbags did not become widespread in American cars until the early 1990s.

=== As a substitute for seat belts ===
Airbags for passenger cars were introduced in the United States in the 1970s. When seat-belt usage rates in the country were quite low compared to modern-day, Ford built experimental cars with airbags in 1971. Allstate operated a fleet of 200 Mercury Montereys and showed the reliability of airbags as well as their operation in crash testing, which also was promoted by the insurance company in popular magazine advertisements. General Motors followed in 1973 using full-sized Chevrolet vehicles. The early fleet of experimental GM vehicles equipped with airbags experienced seven fatalities, one of which was later suspected to have been caused by the airbag.

In 1974, GM made its ACRS system (which consisted of a padded lower dashboard and a passenger-side air bag) available as a regular production option (RPO code AR3) in full-sized Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile models. The GM cars from the 1970s equipped with ACRS had a driver-side airbag, and a driver-side knee restraint. The passenger-side airbag protected both front passengers, and unlike most modern systems, integrated a knee and torso cushion while also having a dual-stage deployment dictated by force of the impact. The cars equipped with ACRS had lap belts for all seating positions, but lacked shoulder belts. Shoulder belts were already mandatory in the United States on closed cars without airbags for the driver and outer front passenger, but GM chose to market its airbags as a substitute for shoulder belts. Prices for this option on Cadillac models were US$225 in 1974, $300 in 1975, and $340 in 1976 (US$ in dollars ).

The early development of airbags coincided with international interest in automobile safety legislation. Some safety experts advocated a performance-based occupant-protection standard rather than one mandating a particular technical solution (which could rapidly become outdated and prove to not be a cost-effective approach). Less emphasis was placed on other designs as countries successfully mandated seat belt restrictions, however.

=== As a supplemental restraint system ===
==== Frontal airbag ====
The auto industry and research and regulatory communities have moved away from their initial view of the airbag as a seat-belt replacement, and the bags are now nominally designated as supplemental restraint systems (SRS) or supplemental inflatable restraints.

In 1981, Mercedes-Benz introduced the airbag in West Germany as an option on its flagship saloon model, S-Class (W126). In the Mercedes system, the sensors automatically tensioned the seat belts to reduce occupants&#x27; motion on impact and then deployed the airbag on impact. This integrated the seat belts and the airbag into a restraint system, rather than the airbag being considered an alternative to the seat belt.

In 1987, the Porsche 944 Turbo became the first car to have driver and passenger airbags as standard equipment. The Porsche 944 and 944S had this as an available option. The same year also had the first airbag in a Japanese car, the Honda Legend.

In 1988, Chrysler became the first United States automaker to fit a driver-side airbag as standard equipment, which was offered in six different models. The following year, Chrysler became the first US auto manufacturer to offer driver-side airbags in all its new passenger models. Chrysler also began featuring the airbags in advertisements showing how the devices had saved lives that helped the public know the value of them and safety became a selling advantage in the late 1980s. All versions of the Chrysler minivans came with airbags starting for the 1991 model year. In 1993, The Lincoln Motor Company boasted that all vehicles in their model line were equipped with dual airbags, one for the driver&#x27;s side and another for the passenger&#x27;s side. The 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee became the first SUV to offer a driver-side airbag when it was launched in 1992. Driver and passenger airbags became standard equipment in all Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and Chrysler Concorde sedans ahead of any safety regulations. Early 1993 saw the 4-millionth airbag-equipped Chrysler vehicle roll off the assembly line. In October 1993, the Dodge Ram became the first pickup truck with a standard driver-side airbag.

The first known collision between two airbag-equipped automobiles took place on 12 March 1990 in Virginia, USA. A 1989 Chrysler LeBaron crossed the center line and hit another 1989 Chrysler LeBaron in a head-on collision, causing both driver airbags to deploy. The drivers suffered only minor injuries despite extensive damage to the vehicles.

The United States Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required passenger cars and light trucks built after 1 September 1998 to have airbags for the driver and the front passenger. In the United States, NHTSA estimated that airbags had saved over 4,600 lives by 1 September 1999; however, the crash deployment experience of the early 1990s installations indicated that some fatalities and serious injuries were in fact caused by airbags. In 1998, NHTSA initiated new rules for advanced airbags that gave automakers more flexibility in devising effective technological solutions. The revised rules also required improved protection for occupants of different sizes regardless of whether they use seat belts, while minimizing the risk to infants, children, and other occupants caused by airbags.

In Europe, airbags were almost unheard of until the early 1990s. By 1991, four manufacturers – BMW, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo – offered the airbag on some of their higher-end models, but shortly afterward, airbags became a common feature on more mainstream cars, with Ford and Vauxhall/Opel among the manufacturers to introduce the airbag to its model ranges in 1992. Citroën, Fiat, Nissan, Hyundai, Peugeot, Renault, and Volkswagen followed shortly afterwards.

By 1999, finding a new mass-market car without an airbag at least as optional equipment was difficult, and some late 1990s products, such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, also featured side airbags. The Peugeot 306 is one example of the European automotive mass-market evolution: starting in early 1993, most of these models did not even offer a driver&#x27;s airbag as an option, but by 1999, even side airbags were available on several variants. Audi was late to offer airbag systems on a broader scale, since even in the 1994 model year, its popular models did not offer airbags. Instead, the German automaker until then relied solely on its proprietary cable-based procon-ten restraint system.

Variable force-deployment front airbags were developed to help minimize injury from the airbag itself.

The emergence of the airbag has contributed to a sharp decline in the number of deaths and serious injuries on the roads of Europe since 1990, and by 2010, the number of cars on European roads lacking an airbag represented a very small percentage of cars, mostly the remaining cars dating from the mid-1990s or earlier.

Many new cars in Latin America, including the Kia Rio, Kia Picanto, Hyundai Grand i10, Mazda 2, Chevrolet Spark and the Chevrolet Onix, are often sold without airbags, as neither airbags nor automatic braking systems in new cars are compulsory in many Latin American countries. Some require the installation of a minimum of only two airbags in new cars which many in this market have.

===== Shape of airbags =====
The Citroën C4 provided the first &quot;shaped&quot; driver airbag, made possible by this car&#x27;s unusual fixed-hub steering wheel.

In 2019, Honda announced it would introduce a new front passenger airbag technology. Developed by Autoliv and Honda R&amp;D in Ohio, United States, this new airbag design features three inflatable chambers connected across the front by a &quot;noninflatable sail panel.&quot; The two outer chambers are larger than the middle chamber. When the airbag deploys, the sail panel cushions the occupant&#x27;s head from the impact of hitting the airbag, and the three chambers hold the occupant&#x27;s head in place, like a catcher&#x27;s mitt. The goal of the tri-chamber airbag is to help &quot;arrest high-speed movement&quot; of the head, thereby reducing the likelihood of concussion injuries in a collision. The first vehicle to come with the tri-chamber airbag installed from the factory was in 2020 (for the 2021 model year) for the Acura TLX. Honda hopes that the new technology will soon make its way to all vehicles.

===== Rear airbag =====
Mercedes began offering rear passengers protection in frontal collisions in September 2020 (for the 2021 model year) for the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W223). The W223 S-Class is the first car equipped with rear seat airbags that use gas to inflate supporting structures that unfold and extend a bag that fills with ambient air, instead of conventional fully gas-inflated airbags that are widely used in automotive airbag systems.

==== Side airbag ====

Essentially, two types of side airbags are commonly used today - the side-torso airbag and the side-curtain airbag. More recently, center airbags are becoming more common in the European market.

Most vehicles equipped with side-curtain airbags also include side-torso airbags. However, some, such as the Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007–09 model Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra, and 2009–12 Dodge Ram do not feature the side-torso airbag.

From around 2000, side-impact airbags became commonplace on even low- to mid-range vehicles, such as the smaller-engined versions of the Ford Fiesta and Peugeot 206, and curtain airbags were also becoming regular features on mass-market cars. The Toyota Avensis, launched in 2003, was the first mass-market car to be sold in Europe with nine airbags.

===== Side torso airbag =====
Side-impact airbags or side-torso airbags are a category of airbags usually located in the seat or door panel, and inflate between the seat occupant and the door. These airbags are designed to reduce the risk of injury to the pelvic and lower abdomen regions. Most vehicles are now being equipped with different types of designs, to help reduce injury and ejection from the vehicle in rollover crashes. More recent side-airbag designs include a two-chamber system; a firmer lower chamber for the pelvic region and softer upper chamber for the ribcage.

Swedish company Autoliv AB was granted a patent on side-impact airbags, and they were first offered as an option in 1994 on the 1995 Volvo 850, and as standard equipment on all Volvo cars made after 1995.
In 1997, Saab introduced the first combined head and torso airbags with the launch of the Saab 9-5.

Some cars, such as the 2010 Volkswagen Polo Mk.5 have combined head- and torso-side airbags. These are fitted in the backrest of the front seats and protect the head and the torso.

===== Side tubular or curtain airbag =====
In 1997, the BMW 7 Series and 5 Series were fitted with tubular-shaped head side airbags (inflatable tubular structure), the &quot;Head Protection System (HPS)&quot; as standard equipment. This airbag was designed to offer head protection in side impact collisions and also maintained inflation for up to seven seconds for rollover protection. However, this tubular-shaped airbag design has been quickly replaced by an inflatable &#x27;curtain&#x27; airbag.

In May 1998, Toyota began offering a side-curtain airbag deploying from the roof on the Progrés. In 1998, the Volvo S80 was given roof-mounted curtain airbags to protect both front and rear passengers. Curtain airbags were then made standard equipment on all new Volvo cars from 2000 except for the first-generation C70, which received an enlarged side-torso airbag that also protects the head of front-seat occupants. The second-generation C70 convertible received the world&#x27;s first door-mounted, side-curtain airbags that deployed upwards.

Curtain airbags have been said to reduce brain injury or fatalities by up to 45% in a side impact with an SUV. These airbags come in various forms (e.g., tubular, curtain, door-mounted) depending on the needs of the application. Many recent SUVs and MPVs have a long inflatable curtain airbag that protects all rows of seats.

In many vehicles, the curtain airbags are programmed to deploy during some/all frontal impacts to manage passenger kinetics (e.g. head hitting B-pillar on the rebound), especially in offset crashes such as the IIHS&#x27;s small overlap crash test.

====== Roll-sensing curtain airbag (RSCA) ======
Roll-sensing curtain airbags are designed to stay inflated for a longer duration of time, cover a larger proportion of the window, and be deployed in a roll-over crash. They offer protection to occupants&#x27; heads and help to prevent ejection. SUVs and pickups are more likely to be equipped with RSCAs due to their higher probability of rolling over and often a switch can disable the feature in case the driver wants to take the vehicle off-road.

===== Center airbag =====


In 2009, Toyota developed the first production rear-seat center airbag designed to reduce the severity of secondary injuries to rear passengers in a side collision. This system deploys from the rear center seat first appearing in on the Crown Majesta. In late 2012, General Motors with supplier Takata introduced a front center airbag; it deploys from the driver&#x27;s seat.

Hyundai Motor Group announced its development of a center-side airbag on September 18, 2019, installed inside the driver&#x27;s seat.

Some Volkswagen vehicles in 2022 equipped with center airbags include the ID.3 and the Golf.

The Polestar 2 also includes a center airbag.

With EuroNCAP updating its testing guidelines in 2020, European and Australian market vehicles increasingly use front-center airbags, rear torso airbags, and rear seat belt pre-tensioners.

==== Knee airbag ====
The second driver-side and separate knee airbag was used in the Kia Sportage SUV and has been standard equipment since then. The airbag is located beneath the steering wheel.

The Toyota Caldina introduced the first driver-side SRS knee airbag on the Japanese market in 2002. Toyota Avensis became the first vehicle sold in Europe equipped with a driver&#x27;s knee airbag. The EuroNCAP reported on the 2003 Avensis, &quot;There has been much effort to protect the driver&#x27;s knees and legs and a knee airbag worked well.&quot; Since then certain models have also included front-passenger knee airbags, which deploy near or over the glove compartment in a crash. Knee airbags are designed to reduce leg injury. The knee airbag has become increasingly common since 2000.

==== Rear curtain airbag ====
In 2008, the new Toyota iQ microcar featured the first production rear-curtain shield airbag to protect the rear occupants&#x27; heads in the event of a rear-end impact.

==== Seat cushion airbag ====
Another feature of the Toyota iQ was a seat-cushion airbag in the passenger seat to prevent the pelvis from diving below the lap belt during a frontal impact or submarining. Later Toyota models such as the Yaris added the feature to the driver&#x27;s seat, as well.

==== Seat-belt airbag ====
The seat-belt airbag is designed to better distribute the forces experienced by a buckled person in a crash using an increased seat belt area. This is done to reduce possible injuries to the rib cage or chest of the belt wearer.
*2010: Ford Explorer and 2013 Ford Flex: optional rear seat belt airbags; standard on the 2013 Lincoln MKT
*2010: Lexus LFA had seat belt airbags for driver and passenger
*2013: Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) has rear seat &quot;belt bags&quot;
*2014: Ford Mondeo Mk IV has optional rear seat belt airbags for the two outer seats

Cessna Aircraft also introduced seat belt airbags. They are as of 2003 standard on the 172, 182, and 206.

==== Pedestrian airbag====
Airbag(s) mounted to the exterior of vehicles, so-called &quot;pedestrian airbags&quot;, are designed to reduce injuries in the event of a vehicle to a pedestrian collision. When a collision is detected the airbag will deploy and cover hard areas, such as a-pillars and bonnet edges, before they can be struck by the pedestrian. 
When introduced in 2012 the Volvo V40 included the world&#x27;s first pedestrian airbag as standard. As a result, the V40 ranked highest (88%) in the EuroNCAP&#x27;s pedestrian tests.

====Manufacturers====
Suppliers of SRS airbags include Autoliv, Daicel, TRW, and JSS (which owns Breed, Key Safety Systems, and Takata). The majority of impact sensors of airbags are manufactured by the Lanka Harness Company.

== Operation ==
The airbags in the vehicle are controlled by a central airbag control unit (ACU), a specific type of ECU. The ACU monitors several related sensors within the vehicle, including accelerometers, impact sensors, side (door) pressure sensors, wheel speed sensors, gyroscopes, brake pressure sensors, and seat occupancy sensors. Oftentimes, ACUs log this—and other—sensor data in a circular buffer and record it to onboard non-volatile memory, to provide a snapshot of the crash event for investigators. As such, an ACU frequently functions as the vehicle&#x27;s event data recorder; not all EDRs are ACUs, and not all ACUs include EDR features. An ACU typically includes capacitors within its circuitry, so that the module remains powered and able to deploy the airbags if the vehicle&#x27;s battery connection to the ACU is severed during a crash.

The bag itself and its inflation mechanism are concealed within the steering wheel boss (for the driver), or the dashboard (for the front passenger), behind plastic flaps or doors that are designed to tear open under the force of the bag inflating. Once the requisite threshold has been reached or exceeded, the airbag control unit will trigger the ignition of a gas generator propellant to rapidly inflate a fabric bag. As the vehicle occupant collides with and squeezes the bag, the gas escapes in a controlled manner through small vent holes. The airbag&#x27;s volume and the size of the vents in the bag are tailored to each vehicle type, to spread out the deceleration of (and thus force experienced by) the occupant over time and over the occupant&#x27;s body, compared to a seat belt alone.

The signals from the various sensors are fed into the airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or the force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various additional restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and &quot;curtain&quot; airbags which cover the side glass). Each restraint device is typically activated with one or more pyrotechnic devices, commonly called an initiator or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between 1 and 3 amperes in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a seat belt pre-tensioner, this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the airbag inflator. The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds. An airbag must inflate quickly to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60–80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.

Older airbag systems contained a mixture of sodium azide (NaN3), KNO3, and SiO2. A typical driver-side airbag contains approximately 50–80 g of NaN3, with the larger passenger-side airbag containing about 250 g. Within about 40 milliseconds of impact, all these components react in three separate reactions that produce nitrogen gas. The reactions, in order, are as follows.

# 2 NaN3 → 2 Na + 3 N2 (g)
# 10 Na + 2 KNO3 → K2O + 5 Na2O + N2 (g)
# K2O + Na2O + 2 SiO2 → K2SiO3 + Na2SiO3

The first two reactions create 4 molar equivalents of nitrogen gas, and the third converts the remaining reactants to relatively inert potassium silicate and sodium silicate. The reason that KNO3 is used rather than something like NaNO3 is because it is less hygroscopic. The materials used in this reaction must not be hygroscopic because absorbed moisture can de-sensitize the system and cause the reaction to fail.

The particle size of the initial reactants is important to reliable operation. The NaN3 and KNO3 must be between 10 and 20 µm, while the SiO2 must be between 5 and 10 µm.

There are ongoing efforts to find alternative compounds so that airbags have less toxic reactants. The reaction of the Sr complex nitrate, (Sr(NH2NHCONHNH2)∙(NO3)2) of carbohydrazide (SrCDH) with various oxidizing agents resultS in the evolution of N2 and CO2 gases. Using KBrO3 as the oxidizing agent resulted in the most vigorous reaction as well as the lowest initial temperature of the reaction. The N2 and CO2 gases evolved made up 99% of all gases evolved. Nearly all the starting materials will not decompose until reaching temperatures of 500 °C or higher, so this could be a viable option as an airbag gas generator.

In a patent containing another plausible alternative to NaN3 driven airbags, the gas-generating materials involved the use of guanidine nitrate, 5-aminotetrazole, bitetrazole dihydrate, nitroimidazole, and basic copper nitrate. It was found that these non-azide reagents allowed for a less toxic, lower combustion temperature reaction, and more easily disposable airbag inflation system.

Front airbags normally do not protect the occupants during side, rear, or rollover collisions. Since airbags deploy only once and deflate quickly after the initial impact, they will not be beneficial during a subsequent collision. Safety belts help reduce the risk of injury in many types of crashes. They help to properly position occupants to maximize the airbag&#x27;s benefits and they help restrain occupants during the initial and any following collisions.

In vehicles equipped with a rollover sensing system, accelerometers, and gyroscopes are used to sense the onset of a rollover event. If a rollover event is determined to be imminent, side-curtain airbags are deployed to help protect the occupant from contact with the side of the vehicle interior, and also to help prevent occupant ejection as the vehicle rolls over.

=== Triggering conditions ===

Airbags are designed to deploy in frontal and near-frontal collisions more severe than a threshold defined by the regulations governing vehicle construction in whatever particular market the vehicle is intended for: United States regulations require deployment in crashes at least equivalent in deceleration to a barrier collision, or similarly, striking a parked car of similar size across the full front of each vehicle at about twice the speed. International regulations are performance-based, rather than technology-based, so airbag deployment threshold is a function of overall vehicle design.

Unlike crash tests into barriers, real-world crashes typically occur at angles other than directly into the front of the vehicle, and the crash forces usually are not evenly distributed across the front of the vehicle. Consequently, the relative speed between a striking and struck vehicle required to deploy the airbag in a real-world crash can be much higher than an equivalent barrier crash. Because airbag sensors measure deceleration, the vehicle speed is not a good indicator of whether an airbag should be deployed. Airbags can deploy due to the vehicle&#x27;s undercarriage striking a low object protruding above the roadway due to the resulting deceleration.

The airbag sensor is a MEMS accelerometer, which is a small integrated circuit with integrated micromechanical elements. The microscopic mechanical element moves in response to rapid deceleration, and this motion causes a change in capacitance, which is detected by the electronics on the chip that then sends a signal to fire the airbag. The most common MEMS accelerometer in use is the ADXL-50 by Analog Devices, but there are other MEMS manufacturers as well.

Initial attempts using mercury switches did not work well. Before MEMS, the primary system used to deploy airbags was called a &quot;rolamite&quot;. A rolamite is a mechanical device, consisting of a roller suspended within a tensioned band. As a result of the particular geometry and material properties used, the roller is free to translate with little friction or hysteresis. This device was developed at Sandia National Laboratories. Rolamite and similar macro-mechanical devices were used in airbags until the mid-1990s after which they were universally replaced with MEMS.

Nearly all airbags are designed to automatically deploy in the event of a vehicle fire when temperatures reach . This safety feature, often termed auto-ignition, helps to ensure that such temperatures do not cause an explosion of the entire airbag module.

Today, airbag triggering algorithms are much more complex, being able to adapt the deployment speed to the crash conditions, and prevent unnecessary deployments. The algorithms are considered valuable intellectual property. Experimental algorithms may take into account such factors as the weight of the occupant, the seat location, and seat belt use, as well as even attempt to determine if a baby seat is present.

==== Inflation ====

When the frontal airbags are to deploy, a signal is sent to the inflator unit within the airbag control unit. An igniter starts a rapid chemical reaction generating primarily nitrogen gas (N2) to fill the airbag making it deploy through the module cover. Some airbag technologies use compressed nitrogen or argon gas with a pyrotechnic operated valve (&quot;hybrid gas generator&quot;), while other technologies use various energetic propellants. Although propellants containing the highly toxic sodium azide (NaN3) were common in early inflator designs, little to no toxic sodium azide has been found on used airbags.

The azide-containing pyrotechnic gas generators contain a substantial amount of the propellant. The driver-side airbag would contain a canister containing about 50 grams of sodium azide. The passenger side container holds about 200 grams of sodium azide.

The alternative propellants may incorporate, for example, a combination of nitroguanidine, phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) or another nonmetallic oxidizer, and a nitrogen-rich fuel different from azide (e.g. tetrazoles, triazoles, and their salts). The burn rate modifiers in the mixture may be an alkaline metal nitrate (NO3-) or nitrite (NO2-), dicyanamide or its salts, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), etc. The coolants and slag formers may be e.g. clay, silica, alumina, glass, etc. Other alternatives are e.g. nitrocellulose based propellants (which have high gas yield but bad storage stability, and their oxygen balance requires secondary oxidation of the reaction products to avoid buildup of carbon monoxide), or high-oxygen nitrogen-free organic compounds with inorganic oxidizers (e.g., di or tricarboxylic acids with chlorates (ClO3-) or perchlorates (ClO4-) and eventually metallic oxides; the nitrogen-free formulation avoids formation of toxic nitrogen oxides).

From the onset of the crash, the entire deployment and inflation process is about 0.04 seconds. Because vehicles change speed so quickly in a crash, airbags must inflate rapidly to reduce the risk of the occupant hitting the vehicle&#x27;s interior.

==== Variable-force deployment ====
Advanced airbag technologies are being developed to tailor airbag deployment to the severity of the crash, the size, and posture of the vehicle occupant, belt usage, and how close that person is to the actual airbag. Many of these systems use multi-stage inflators that deploy less forcefully in stages in moderate crashes than in very severe crashes. Occupant sensing devices let the airbag control unit know if someone is occupying a seat adjacent to an airbag, the mass/weight of the person, whether a seat belt or child restraint is being used, and whether the person is forward in the seat and close to the airbag. Based on this information and crash severity information, the airbag is deployed at either a high force level, a less forceful level, or not at all.

Adaptive airbag systems may utilize multi-stage airbags to adjust the pressure within the airbag. The greater the pressure within the airbag, the more force the airbag will exert on the occupants as they come in contact with it. These adjustments allow the system to deploy the airbag with a moderate force for most collisions; reserving the maximum force airbag only for the severest of collisions. Additional sensors to determine the location, weight or relative size of the occupants may also be used. Information regarding the occupants and the severity of the crash are used by the airbag control unit, to determine whether airbags should be suppressed or deployed, and if so, at various output levels.
==== Post-deployment ====

A chemical reaction produces a burst of nitrogen to inflate the bag. Once an airbag deploys, deflation begins immediately as the gas escapes through vent(s) in the fabric (or, as it is sometimes called, the cushion) and cools. Deployment is frequently accompanied by the release of dust-like particles, and gases in the vehicle&#x27;s interior (called effluent). Most of this dust consists of cornstarch, french chalk, or talcum powder, which are used to lubricate the airbag during deployment.

Newer designs produce effluent primarily consisting of harmless talcum powder/cornstarch and nitrogen gas. In older designs using an azide-based propellant (usually NaN3), varying amounts of sodium hydroxide nearly always are initially present. In small amounts this chemical can cause minor irritation to the eyes and/or open wounds; however, with exposure to air, it quickly turns into sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). However, this transformation is not 100% complete, and invariably leaves residual amounts of hydroxide ions from NaOH. Depending on the type of airbag system, potassium chloride may also be present.

For most people, the only effect the dust may produce is some minor irritation of the throat and eyes. Generally, minor irritations only occur when the occupant remains in the vehicle for many minutes with the windows closed and no ventilation. However, some people with asthma may develop a potentially lethal asthmatic attack from inhaling the dust.

Because of the airbag exit flap design of the steering wheel boss and dashboard panel, these items are not designed to be recoverable if an airbag deploys, meaning that they have to be replaced if the vehicle has not been written off in a collision. Moreover, the dust-like particles and gases can cause irreparable cosmetic damage to the dashboard and upholstery, meaning that minor collisions that result in the deployment of airbags can be costly, even if there are no injuries and there is only minor damage to the vehicle structure.

== Regulatory specifications ==

=== United States ===
On 11 July 1984, the United States government amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS 208) to require cars produced after 1 April 1989 to be equipped with a passive restraint for the driver. An airbag or an automatic seat belt would meet the requirements of the standard. Airbag introduction was stimulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, airbags were not mandatory on light trucks until 1997.

In 1998, FMVSS 208 was amended to require dual front airbags, and reduced-power, second-generation airbags were also mandated. This was due to the injuries caused by first-generation airbags, though FMVSS 208 continues to require that bags be engineered and calibrated to be able to &quot;save&quot; the life of an &quot;unbelted&quot; 50th-percentile size and weight &quot;male&quot; crash test dummy. The technical performance and validation requirements for the inflator assembly used in airbag modules are specified in SAE USCAR 24–2.

=== Europe ===
Some countries outside North America adhere to internationalized European ECE vehicle and equipment regulations rather than the United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. ECE airbags are generally smaller and inflate less forcefully than United States airbags because the ECE specifications are based on &quot;belted&quot; crash test dummies.

The Euro NCAP vehicle safety rating encourages manufacturers to take a comprehensive approach to occupant safety; a good rating can only be achieved by combining airbags with other safety features. Almost every new car sold in Europe is equipped with front and side airbags, but in the European Union in 2020 and in the United Kingdom, and most other developed countries there is no direct legal requirement for new cars to feature airbags.

=== Central and South America ===
Ecuador requires dual front airbags in new car models since 2013.

Since January 2014, except for micro vehicles, all new cars made or imported in Argentina must have front airbags.

Since 1 January 2014, all new cars sold in Brazil must have dual front airbags.

Since July 2014, all new cars sold in Uruguay must have dual front airbags.

Since December 2016, all new cars sold in Chile must have dual front airbags.

Since 1 January 2017, all cars made or imported in Colombia must have dual front airbags.

Since 1 January 2020, all new cars sold in Mexico must have dual front airbags.

=== India ===
On 5 March 2021, the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways mandated that all new vehicle models introduced in India after 1 April 2021 have dual front airbags; the regulation also requires that all existing models be equipped with dual front airbags by 31 August 2021.
India also mandated that all passenger vehicles sold after October 2023 must have a minimum of six airbags.

== Maintenance ==

Inadvertent airbag deployment while the vehicle is being serviced can result in severe injury, and an improperly installed or defective airbag unit may not operate or perform as intended. Those servicing a vehicle, as well as first responders, must exercise extreme awareness, as many airbag control systems may remain powered for roughly 30 minutes after disconnecting the vehicle&#x27;s battery. Some countries impose restrictions on the sale, transport, handling, and service of airbags and system components. In Germany, airbags are regulated as harmful explosives; only mechanics with special training are allowed to service airbag systems.

Some automakers (such as Mercedes-Benz) call for the replacement of undeployed airbags after a certain time to ensure their reliability in a collision. One example is the 1992 S500, which has an expiry date sticker attached to the door pillar. Some Škoda vehicles indicate an expiry date of 14 years from the date of manufacture. In this case, replacement would be uneconomic as the car would have negligible value at 14 years old, far less than the cost of fitting new airbags. Volvo has stated that &quot;airbags do not require replacement during the lifetime of the vehicle,&quot; though this cannot be taken as a guarantee on the device.

== Limitations ==
Although the millions of installed airbags in use have an excellent safety record, some limitations on their ability to protect car occupants exist. The original implementation of front airbags did little to protect against side collisions, which can be more dangerous than frontal collisions because the protective crumple zone in front of the passenger compartment is completely bypassed. Side airbags and protective airbag curtains are increasingly being required in modern vehicles to protect against this very common category of collisions.

Airbags are designed to deploy once only, so are ineffective if any further collisions occur after an initial impact. Multiple impacts may occur during rollovers or other incidents involving multiple collisions, such as many multivehicle collisions.

An extremely dangerous situation occurs during &quot;underride collisions&quot;, in which a passenger vehicle collides with the rear of a tractor-trailer lacking a rear underride guard, or hits the side of such a trailer not equipped with a side underride guard. The platform bed of a typical trailer is roughly at the head height of a seated adult occupant of a typical passenger car. This means not much of a barrier exists between a head and the edge of the trailer platform, except a glass windshield. In an underride collision, the car&#x27;s crush zones designed to absorb collision energy are completely bypassed, and the airbags may not deploy in time because the car does not decelerate appreciably until the windshield and roof pillars have already impacted the trailer bed. Even delayed inflation of airbags may be useless because of major intrusion into the passenger space, leaving occupants at high risk of major head trauma or decapitation in even low-speed collisions. Western European standards for underride guards have been stricter than North American standards, which typically have allowed grandfathering of older equipment that may still be on the road for decades.

Typical airbag systems are completely disabled by turning off the ignition key. Unexpected turnoffs usually also disable the engine, power steering, and power brakes, and can be the direct cause of a collision. If a violent collision occurs, the disabled airbags will not deploy to protect vehicle occupants. In 2014, General Motors admitted to concealing information about fatal collisions caused by defective ignition switches that would abruptly shut down a car (including its airbags). Between 13 and 74 deaths have been directly attributed to this defect, depending on how the fatalities are classified.

== Injuries and fatalities ==
Under some rare conditions, airbags can injure and in some very rare instances kill vehicle occupants. To provide crash protection for occupants not wearing seat belts, United States airbag designs trigger much more forcefully than airbags designed to the international ECE standards used in most other countries. Recent &quot;smart&quot; airbag controllers can recognize if a seat belt is used, and alter the airbag cushion deployment parameters accordingly.

In 1990, the first automotive fatality attributed to an airbag was reported. TRW produced the first gas-inflated airbag in 1994, with sensors and low inflation-force bags becoming common soon afterward. Dual-depth (also known as dual-stage) airbags appeared on passenger cars in 1998. By 2005, deaths related to airbags had declined, with no adult deaths and two child deaths attributed to airbags that year. However, injuries remain fairly common in collisions with airbag deployment.

Serious injuries are less common, but severe or fatal injuries can occur to vehicle occupants very near an airbag or in direct contact when it deploys. Such injuries may be sustained by unconscious drivers slumped over the steering wheel, unrestrained or improperly restrained occupants who slide forward in the seat during precrash braking, and properly belted drivers sitting very close to the steering wheel. A good reason for the driver not to cross hands over the steering wheel, a rule taught to most learner drivers, but quickly forgotten by most, is that an airbag deployment while negotiating a turn may result in the driver&#x27;s hand(s) being driven forcefully into his or her face, exacerbating any injuries from the airbag alone.

Improvements in sensing and gas-generator technology have allowed the development of third-generation airbag systems that can adjust their deployment parameters to the size, weight, position, and restraint status of the occupant. These improvements have demonstrated a reduced injury risk factor for small adults and children, who had an increased risk of injury with first-generation airbag systems.

One model of airbags made by the Takata Corporation used ammonium nitrate–based gas-generating compositions in airbag inflators instead of the more stable, but more expensive compound tetrazole. The ammonium nitrate-based inflators have a flaw where old inflators with long-term exposure to hot and humid climate conditions could rupture during deployment, projecting metal shards through the airbag and into the driver. As of December 2022, the defect has caused 33 deaths worldwide, with up to 24 in the U.S. and the remaining in Australia and Malaysia. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recalled over 33 million vehicles in May 2015, and fined Takata $70 million in November 2015. Toyota, Mazda, and Honda have said that they will not use ammonium-nitrate inflators. In June 2017, Takata filed for bankruptcy.

=== Airbag fatality statistics ===
From 1990 to 2000, the United States NHTSA identified 175 fatalities caused by airbags. Most of these (104) have been children. About 3.3 million airbag deployments have occurred during that interval, and the agency estimates more than 6,377 lives were saved and countless injuries were prevented.

A rear-facing infant restraint put in the front seat of a vehicle places an infant&#x27;s head close to the airbag, which can cause severe head injuries or death if the airbag deploys. Some modern cars include a switch to disable the front-passenger airbag, in case a child-supporting seat is used there (although not in Australia, where rear-facing child seats are prohibited in the front where an airbag is fitted).

In vehicles with side airbags, it is dangerous for occupants to lean against the windows, doors, and pillars, or to place objects between themselves and the side of the vehicle. Articles hung from a vehicle&#x27;s clothes hanger hooks can be hazardous if the vehicle&#x27;s side-curtain airbags are deployed. A seat-mounted airbag may also cause internal injury if the occupant leans against the door.

== Aerospace and military applications ==
The aerospace industry and the United States government have applied airbag technologies for many years. NASA and United States Department of Defense have incorporated airbag systems in various aircraft and spacecraft applications as early as the 1960s.

=== Spacecraft airbag landing systems ===

The first use of airbags for landing were Luna 9 and Luna 13. As with later missions, these would use the airbags to bounce along the surface, absorbing landing energy. The Mars Pathfinder lander employed an innovative airbag landing system, supplemented with aerobraking, parachute, and solid rocket landing thrusters. This prototype successfully tested the concept, and the two Mars Exploration Rover Mission landers employed similar landing systems. The Beagle 2 Mars lander also tried to use airbags for landing; the landing was successful, and the lander touched down safely, but several of the spacecraft&#x27;s solar panels failed to deploy, thereby disabling the spacecraft.

The Boeing Starliner uses six airbags to cushion the ground landing of the crewed capsule.

=== Aircraft airbag landing systems ===
Airbags have also been used on military fixed-wing aircraft, such as the escape crew capsule of the F-111 Aardvark.

=== Occupant protection ===
The United States Army has incorporated airbags in its UH-60A/L Black Hawk and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter fleets. The Cockpit Air Bag System (CABS) consists of forward and lateral airbags, and an inflatable tubular structure (on the OH-58D only) with an Electronic Crash Sensor Unit (ECSU). The CABS system was developed by the United States Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, through a contract with Simula Safety Systems (now BAE Systems). It is the first conventional airbag system for occupant injury prevention (worldwide) designed and developed and placed in service for an aircraft, and the first specifically for helicopter applications.

== Other uses ==
In the mid-1970s, the UK Transport Research Laboratory tested several types of motorcycle airbags. In 2006 Honda introduced the first production motorcycle airbag safety system on its Gold Wing motorcycle. Honda claims that sensors in the front forks can detect a severe frontal collision and decide when to deploy the airbag, absorbing some of the forward energy of the rider and reducing the velocity at which the rider may be thrown from the motorcycle.

More commonly, air bag vests – either integrated into the motorcyclist&#x27;s jacket or worn over it – have started to become used by regular riders on the street. MotoGP has made it compulsory since 2018 for riders to wear suits with integrated airbags.

Similarly, companies such as Helite and Hit-Air have commercialized equestrian airbags, which attach to the saddle and are worn by the rider. Other sports, particularly skiing and snowboarding, have started introducing airbag safety mechanisms.

<text>Samuel Houston (, ; March 2, 1793 – July 26, 1863) was an American general and statesman who played a prominent role in the Texas Revolution. He served as the first and third president of the Republic of Texas and was one of the first two individuals to represent Texas in the United States Senate. He also served as the sixth governor of Tennessee and the seventh governor of Texas, the only individual to be elected governor of two different states in the United States.

Born in Rockbridge County, Virginia, Houston and his family relocated to Maryville, Tennessee, when he was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home, spending about three years living with the Cherokee, becoming known as &quot;Raven&quot;. He served under General Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812; afterwards, he was appointed as a sub-agent to oversee the removal of the Cherokee from Tennessee into Arkansas Territory in 1818. With the support of Jackson, among others, Houston won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson&#x27;s presidential candidacies and, in 1827, Houston was elected as the governor of Tennessee. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, and moved to the Arkansas Territory to live with the Cherokee once more.

Houston settled in Texas in 1832. After the Battle of Gonzales, he helped organize Texas&#x27;s provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the Texian Army. He led the Texian Army to victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive battle in Texas&#x27;s war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won the 1836 Texan presidential election. He left office due to term limits in 1838, but won another term in the 1841 Texas presidential election. Houston played a key role in the annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845 and, in 1846, was elected to represent Texas in the United States Senate. He joined the Democratic Party and supported President James K. Polk&#x27;s prosecution of the Mexican–American War.

His Senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to radicals from both the North and South. He voted for the Compromise of 1850, which settled many of the residual territorial issues from the Mexican–American War and the annexation of Texas. Houston owned slaves throughout his life. He voted against the Kansas–Nebraska Act, as he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the American Party in the 1856 presidential election, as well as for the Constitutional Union Party in the 1860 presidential election. In 1859, Houston won election as the governor of Texas. In this role, he opposed secession, and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the Confederate States of America. He was forced out of office in 1861, and died two years later in 1863. Houston&#x27;s name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the eponym of the city of Houston, the fourth-most-populous city in the United States.

==Early life==
Samuel Houston was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia on March 2, 1793, to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston&#x27;s parents were descended from Scottish and Irish immigrants who had settled in Colonial America in the 1730s, including his great-grandfather John Houston. Houston&#x27;s father was descended from Ulster Scots people and the Houston baronets, the founders of Clan Houston in Scotland. Samuel inherited the Timber Ridge plantation and mansion in Rockbridge County, Virginia, which was worked by enslaved African Americans. During the American Revolutionary War, Captain Houston served in Morgan&#x27;s Rifle Brigade as a paymaster. He served in the Virginian militia, which required him to pay his own expenses and to be away from his family for long periods of time. Thus, the plantation and his family&#x27;s finances suffered.

He had five brothers and three sisters: Paxton, Robert, James (married Patience Bills), John, William (married Mary Ball), Isabella, Mary (married Matthew Wallace), and Eliza (who married Samuel Moore).

His father, Samuel Sr., planned to sell Timber Ridge and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Elizabeth, his mother, followed through on those plans, settling the family near Maryville, Tennessee, the seat of Blount County. At that time, Tennessee was on the American frontier, and even larger towns like Nashville were vigilant against Native American raids. He had dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area of east-central Tennessee. When they arrived, Elizabeth cleared the land, built a house, and planted crops. Her oldest children, Paxton, Isabella, and Robert died within a few years after they arrived in Tennessee. Elizabeth relied on James and John to run the store in Maryville, to operate the farm, and to watch over the younger children.

Houston had a carefree disposition, however, and liked to escape to explore the frontier. He was at odds with the concepts of hell and damnation preached by his mother&#x27;s religion, Presbyterianism, and he was not interested in schooling. However, he did take an interest in his father&#x27;s library, reading works by classical authors like Virgil, as well as more contemporary works by authors such as Jedidiah Morse.

Not interested in farming and working in the family store, at the age of 16, he left his family to live with a Cherokee tribe, led by Chief John Jolly (Cherokee name: &quot;Ahuludegi&quot;, also spelled &quot;Oolooteka&quot;) on Hiwassee Island. Houston formed a close relationship with Jolly and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as &#x27;Raven.&#x27; According to James L. Haley, he appreciated the &quot;free and unsophisticated spiritual expression of the Native Americans.&quot; He left the tribe to return to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse. He attended Porter Academy, where he was taught by Rev. Isaac L. Anderson, founder of Maryville College.

According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life. Haley states that he was interested in his younger brother&#x27;s and his sisters&#x27; welfare when he lived on Hiwassee Island. He felt used by the rest of the family.

==War of 1812 and aftermath==
In 1812, Houston enlisted in the United States Army, which then was engaged in the War of 1812 against Britain and Britain&#x27;s Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the 39th Infantry Regiment, Thomas Hart Benton, and by the end of 1813, Houston had risen to the rank of third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded by General Andrew Jackson, who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the Muscogee (or &quot;Creek&quot;) tribe in the Old Southwest. Houston was wounded badly in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, the decisive battle in the Creek War. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman John Rhea. During that time he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant.

Sometime in early 1817, Sam Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army&#x27;s Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the removal of Cherokee from East Tennessee. In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from the Secretary of War John C. Calhoun after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that lasted until Calhoun died in 1850. Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818, he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in Arkansas Territory.

==Early political career==
After leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor Joseph McMinn, Houston won election as the district attorney for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as a major general of the Tennessee militia. Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812. Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the 1820 United States census, and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee&#x27;s 9th congressional district. In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a war of independence against the Ottoman Empire.

Houston strongly supported Jackson&#x27;s candidacy in the 1824 presidential election, which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a contingent election, which was won by John Quincy Adams. Supporters of Jackson eventually coalesced into the Democratic Party, and those who favored Adams became known as National Republicans. With Jackson&#x27;s backing, Houston won election as governor of Tennessee in 1827. Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living in the public domain. He also aided Jackson&#x27;s successful campaign in the 1828 presidential election.

In January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of Gallatin, Tennessee. The marriage quickly fell apart, possibly because Eliza loved another man. In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as governor of Tennessee. Shortly after leaving office, he traveled to Arkansas Territory to rejoin the Cherokee.

==Political exile and controversy==
Houston was reunited with Ahuludegi&#x27;s group of Cherokee in mid-1829. Because of Houston&#x27;s government experience and connections with President Jackson, several local Native American tribes asked Houston to mediate disputes and communicate their needs to the Jackson administration. In late 1829, the Cherokee accorded Houston tribal membership and dispatched him to Washington to negotiate several issues. In anticipation of the removal of the remaining Cherokee east of the Mississippi River, Houston unsuccessfully bid to supply rations to the Native Americans during their journey. When Houston returned to Washington in 1832, Congressman William Stanbery alleged that Houston had placed a fraudulent bid in 1830 in collusion with the Jackson administration. On April 13, 1832, after Stanbery refused to answer Houston&#x27;s letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane. After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House Andrew Stevenson formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages.

==Texas Revolution==
In mid-1832, Houston&#x27;s friends William H. Wharton and John Austin Wharton wrote to convince him to travel to the Mexican possession of Texas, where unrest among the American settlers was growing. The Mexican government had invited Americans to settle the sparsely populated region of Texas, but many of the settlers, including the Whartons, disliked Mexican rule. Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter, he was granted land in Texas. Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches, Texas at the Convention of 1833, which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew a proposed state constitution. After the convention, Texan leader Stephen F. Austin petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President Valentín Gómez Farías. In 1834, Antonio López de Santa Anna assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin. In October 1835, the Texas Revolution broke out with the Battle of Gonzales, a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the Consultation, a congregation of Texas leaders.

Along with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the Texian Army, though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army. Houston helped organize the Convention of 1836, where the Republic of Texas declared independence from Mexico, and appointed him as Commander-in-Chief of the Texas Army. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from William B. Travis, who commanded Texan forces under siege by Santa Anna at the Alamo. The convention confirmed Houston&#x27;s command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis&#x27;s force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans and caused desertions in Houston&#x27;s ranks. Commanding a force of about 350 men that numerically was inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.

Though the provisional government, as well as many of his own subordinates, urged him to attack the Mexican army, Houston continued the retreat east, informing his soldiers that they constituted &quot;the only army in Texas now present ... There are but a few of us, and if we are beaten, the fate of Texas is sealed.&quot; Santa Anna divided his forces and finally caught up to Houston in mid-April 1836. Santa Anna&#x27;s force of about 1,350 soldiers trapped Houston&#x27;s force of 783 men in a marsh; rather than pressing the attack, Santa Anna ordered his soldiers to make camp. On April 21, Houston ordered an attack on the Mexican army, beginning the Battle of San Jacinto. The Texans quickly routed Santa Anna&#x27;s force, though Houston&#x27;s horse was shot out under him and his ankle was shattered by a stray bullet. In the aftermath of the Battle of San Jacinto, a detachment of Texans captured Santa Anna. Santa Anna was forced to sign the Treaty of Velasco, which established a ceasefire between the two forces and laid out the first few steps towards Texan independence. Houston stayed briefly for negotiations, then returned to the United States for treatment of his ankle wound.

==President of Texas==
Victory in the Battle of San Jacinto made Houston a hero to many Texans, and he won the 1836 Texas presidential election, defeating Stephen F. Austin, who would receive the honor of having the city of Austin named after him, and Henry Smith. Houston took office on October 22, 1836, after interim president David G. Burnet resigned. During the presidential election, the voters of Texas overwhelmingly indicated their desire for Texas to be annexed by the United States. Houston, meanwhile, faced the challenge of assembling a new government, putting the country&#x27;s finances in order, and handling relations with Mexico. He selected Mirabeau Lamar as vice president, Thomas Jefferson Rusk as secretary of war, Smith as secretary of the treasury, Samuel Rhoads Fisher as secretary of the navy, James Collinsworth as attorney general, and Austin as secretary of state. Houston sought normalized relations with Mexico, and despite some resistance from the legislature, arranged the release of Santa Anna. Concerned about upsetting the balance between slave states and free states, U.S. President Andrew Jackson refused to push for the annexation of Texas, but in his last official act in office he granted Texas diplomatic recognition. With the United States unwilling to annex Texas, Houston began courting British support; as part of this effort, he urged the end of the importation of slaves into Texas.

In early 1837, the government moved to a new capital, the city of Houston, named after him as the country&#x27;s first president. In 1838, Houston frequently clashed with Congress over issues such as a treaty with the Cherokee and a land-office act and was forced to put down the Córdova Rebellion, a plot to allow Mexico to reclaim Texas with aid from the Kickapoo Indians. The Texas constitution barred presidents from seeking a second term, so Houston did not stand for re-election in the 1838 election and left office in late 1838. He was succeeded by Mirabeau B. Lamar, who, along with Burnet, led a faction of Texas politicians opposed to Houston. The Lamar administration removed many of Houston&#x27;s appointees, launched a war against the Cherokee, and established a new capital at Austin, Texas. Meanwhile, Houston opened a legal practice and co-founded a land company with the intent of developing the town of Sabine City. In 1839, he was elected to represent San Augustine County in the Texas House of Representatives.

Houston defeated Burnet in the 1841 Texas presidential election, winning a large majority of the vote. Houston appointed Anson Jones as secretary of state, Asa Brigham as secretary of the treasury, George Washington Hockley as secretary of war, and George Whitfield Terrell as attorney general. The republic faced a difficult financial situation; at one point, Houston commandeered an American brig used to transport Texas soldiers because the government could not afford to pay the brig&#x27;s captain. The Santa Fe Expedition and other initiatives pursued by Lamar had stirred tensions with Mexico, and rumors frequently raised fears that Santa Anna would launch an invasion of Texas. Houston continued to curry favor with Britain and France, partly in the hope that British and French influence in Texas would encourage the United States to annex Texas. The Tyler administration made the annexation of Texas its chief foreign policy priority, and in April 1844, Texas and the United States signed an annexation treaty. Annexation did not have sufficient support in Congress, and the United States Senate rejected the treaty in June.

Henry Clay and Martin Van Buren, the respective front-runners for the Whig and Democratic nominations in the 1844 presidential election, both opposed the annexation of Texas. However, Van Buren&#x27;s opposition to annexation damaged his candidacy, and he was defeated by James K. Polk, an acolyte of Jackson and an old friend of Houston, at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. Polk defeated Clay in the general election, giving backers of annexation an electoral mandate. Meanwhile, Houston&#x27;s term ended in December 1844, and he was succeeded by Anson Jones, his secretary of state. In the waning days of his own presidency, Tyler used Polk&#x27;s victory to convince Congress to approve of the annexation of Texas. Seeking Texas&#x27;s immediate acceptance of annexation, Tyler made Texas a generous offer that allowed the state to retain control of its public lands, though it would be required to keep its public debt. A Texas convention approved of the offer of annexation in July 1845, and Texas officially became the 28th U.S. state on December 29, 1845.

==U.S. Senator==

===Mexican–American War and aftermath (1846–1853)===

In February 1846, the Texas legislature elected Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk as Texas&#x27;s two inaugural U.S. senators. Houston chose to align with the Democratic Party, which contained many of his old political allies, including President Polk. As a former president of Texas, Houston is the only former foreign head of state to have served in the U.S. Congress. He was the first person to serve as the governor of a state and then be elected to the U.S. Senate by another state. In 2018, Mitt Romney became the second.
William W. Bibb accomplished the same feat in reverse order. 

Breaking with the Senate tradition that held that freshman senators were not to address the Senate, Houston strongly advocated in early 1846 for the annexation of Oregon Country. In the Oregon Treaty, reached later in 1846, Britain and the United States agreed to split Oregon Country. Meanwhile, Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to lead a U.S. army to the Rio Grande, which had been set as the Texas-Mexico border under the Treaty of Velasco; Mexico claimed the Nueces River constituted the true border. After a skirmish between Taylor&#x27;s unit and the Mexican army, the Mexican–American War broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk&#x27;s prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847. After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, acquired the Mexican Cession. Mexico also agreed to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between Mexico and Texas.

After the war, disputes over the extension of slavery into the territories raised sectional tensions. Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the Oregon Bill of 1848, which organized Oregon Territory as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated &quot;I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].&quot; He criticized both Northern abolitionists and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union. He supported the Compromise of 1850, a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories. Under the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, the slave trade was prohibited in the District of Columbia, a more stringent fugitive slave law was passed, and Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory were established. Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained El Paso, Texas, and the United States assumed Texas&#x27;s large public debt. Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the 1852 presidential election, but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state. The 1852 Democratic National Convention ultimately nominated Franklin Pierce, a compromise nominee, who went on to win the election.

===Pierce and Buchanan administrations (1853–1859)===

In 1854, Senator Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which organized Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory. The act also repealed the Missouri Compromise, an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36°30′ north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery. Houston&#x27;s opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party. In 1855, Houston began to be associated publicly with the American Party, the political wing of the nativist and unionist Know Nothing movement. The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery Republican Party had both emerged as major political movements. Houston&#x27;s affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the naturalization period for immigrants to 21 years. He was attracted to the Know Nothing&#x27;s support for a Native American state as well the party&#x27;s unionist stance.

Houston sought the presidential nomination at the Know Nothing party&#x27;s 1856 national convention, but the party nominated former President Millard Fillmore. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore&#x27;s selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas–Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore&#x27;s candidacy. Despite Houston&#x27;s renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat James Buchanan won the 1856 presidential election. The American Party collapsed after the election, and Houston did not affiliate with a national political party for the remainder of his tenure in the senate. In the 1857 Texas gubernatorial election, Texas Democrats nominated Hardin Richard Runnels, who supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act and attacked Houston&#x27;s record. In response, Houston announced his own candidacy for governor, but Runnels defeated him by a decisive margin. It was the only electoral defeat of his career. After the gubernatorial election, the Texas legislature denied Houston re-election in the senate; Houston rejected calls to resign immediately and served until the end of his term in early 1859.

==Governor of Texas==

Houston ran against Runnels in the 1859 gubernatorial election. Capitalizing on Runnels&#x27;s unpopularity over state issues such as Native American raids, Houston won the election and took office in December 1859. In the 1860 presidential election, Houston and John Bell were the two major contenders for the presidential nomination of the newly formed Constitutional Union Party, which consisted largely of Southern unionists. Houston narrowly trailed Bell on the first ballot of the 1860 Constitutional Union Convention, but Bell clinched the nomination on the second ballot. Nonetheless, some of Houston&#x27;s Texan supporters nominated him for president in April 1860. Other backers attempted to launch a nationwide campaign, but in August 1860, Houston announced that he would not be a candidate for president. He refused to endorse any of the remaining presidential candidates. In late 1860, Houston campaigned across his home state, calling on Texans to resist those who advocated for secession if Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election.

After Lincoln won the November 1860 presidential election, several Southern states seceded from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America. A Texas political convention voted to secede from the United States on February 1, 1861, and Houston proclaimed that Texas was once again an independent republic, but he refused to recognize that same convention&#x27;s authority to join Texas to the Confederacy. After Houston refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy, the legislature declared the governorship vacant. Houston did not recognize the validity of his removal, but he did not attempt to use force to remain in office, and he refused aid from the federal government to prevent his removal. His successor, Edward Clark, was sworn in in March 1861. In an undelivered speech, Houston wrote:

On April 19, 1861, he told a crowd:

According to historian Randolph Campbell:

Houston did everything possible to prevent secession and war, but his first loyalty was to Texas—and the South. Houston refused offers of troops from the United States to keep Texas in the Union and announced on May 10, 1861 that he would stand with the Confederacy in its war effort.

==Retirement and death==
After leaving office, Houston returned to his home in Galveston. He later settled in Huntsville, Texas, where he lived in a structure known as the Steamboat House. In the midst of the Civil War, Houston was shunned by many Texas leaders, though he continued to correspond with Confederate officer Ashbel Smith and Texas governor Francis Lubbock. His son, Sam Houston Jr., served in the Confederate army during the Civil War, but returned home after being wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Houston&#x27;s health suffered a precipitous decline in April 1863, which contributed to his death on July 26, 1863, at 70 years of age.

The inscription on Houston&#x27;s tomb reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
A Brave Soldier. A Fearless Statesman.
A Great Orator—A Pure Patriot.
A Faithful Friend, A Loyal Citizen.
A Devoted Husband and Father.
A Consistent Christian—An Honest Man.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Personal life ==

In January 1829 Sam Houston, then Governor of Tennessee, married 19-year-old Eliza Allen. The marriage lasted 11 weeks. Neither Houston nor Eliza ever gave a reason for their separation, but Eliza refused to sanction divorce. Subsequently, he resigned his governorship and went to live with his Cherokee family for three years. In the summer of 1830, Houston married Dianna Rogers (sometimes called Tiana), daughter of Chief John &quot;Hellfire&quot; Rogers (1740–1833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764–1806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a Cherokee ceremony. The ceremony was modest since it was Dianna&#x27;s second marriage; she was widowed with two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston first met when she was ten years old, and he was stunned to see how beautiful she was when he returned to her village years later. The two lived together for several years. Tennessee society disapproved of the marriage because under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston. After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Dianna later remarried. She died in 1838 of pneumonia. Will Rogers was her nephew, three generations removed.

In 1837, after becoming President of the Republic of Texas, he was able to acquire, from a district court judge, a divorce from Eliza Allen.

In 1839, he purchased a horse which became one of the foundation sires of the American Quarter Horse breed named Copperbottom. He owned the horse until its death in 1860.

On May 9, 1840, Houston, aged 47, married for a third time. His bride was 21-year-old Margaret Moffette Lea of Marion, Alabama, the daughter of planters. They had eight children, including Sam Jr., Andrew, and Temple. Margaret acted as a tempering influence on her much older husband and convinced him to stop drinking. Although the Houstons had numerous houses, they kept only one continuously: Cedar Point (1840–1863) on Trinity Bay.

In 1833, Houston was baptized into the Catholic faith in order to qualify under the existing Mexican law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas. The sacrament was held in the living room of the Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches, Texas. By 1854, Margaret had spent 14 years trying to convert Houston to the Baptist church. With the assistance of George Washington Baines, she convinced Houston to convert, and he agreed to adult baptism. Spectators from neighboring communities came to Independence, Texas, to witness the event. On November 19, 1854, Houston was baptized by Rev. Rufus C. Burleson, president of Baylor University, by immersion in Little Rocky Creek, two miles southeast of Independence.

== Relationship to slavery ==

Houston was born on and inherited a slave plantation and mansion, and owned many slaves throughout his life. While he did not enforce some anti-slavery measures, strong slavery laws were still in place under his leadership. He did not support the westward expansion of slavery. His greatest focus was not splitting up the Union, and thought states should decide for themselves on the issue of slavery.

==Legacy==
Houston, the largest city in Texas and the American South, is named in his honor. Several other things and places are named for Houston, including Sam Houston State University; Houston County, Minnesota; Houston County, Tennessee; Houston County, Texas. Other monuments and memorials include Sam Houston National Forest, Sam Houston Regional Library and Research Center, U.S. Army post Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, the USS &quot;Sam Houston&quot; (SSBN-609), and a sculpture of Houston in the city of Houston&#x27;s Hermann Park. In addition, a 67-foot-tall statue of Houston, created by sculptor David Adickes, named &quot;A Tribute to Courage&quot; (and colloquially called &quot;Big Sam&quot;) stands next to I-45, between Dallas and Houston, in Huntsville, Texas. Along with Stephen F. Austin, Houston is one of two Texans with a statue in the National Statuary Hall. Houston has been portrayed in works such as &quot;Man of Conquest&quot;, &quot;Gone to Texas&quot;, &quot;Texas Rising&quot;, and &quot;The Alamo&quot;. In 1960, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

There is a question about whether Houston made a pejorative comment about Mexicans in an 1835 speech to the Texas volunteer army at Refugio. One second hand source makes this claim; however, subsequent research casts doubt on the source and concludes that the disparaging comment is unlikely to have occurred.

<text>John Francis Buck (August 21, 1924 – June 18, 2002) was an American sportscaster, best known for his work announcing Major League Baseball games of the St. Louis Cardinals. His play-by-play work earned him recognition (or induction in some cases) from numerous halls of fame (Baseball, Pro Football, and Radio). He has also been inducted as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. He was the father of ESPN sportscaster Joe Buck.

==Early years and military service==

Buck was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the third of seven children of Earle and Kathleen Buck. His father was a railroad accountant who commuted weekly to New Jersey. From an early age, Buck dreamed of becoming a sports announcer with his early exposure to sports broadcasting coming from listening to Boston Red Sox baseball games announced by Fred Hoey.

Part of his childhood coincided with the Great Depression, and Buck remembered his family sometimes using a metal slug to keep a coin-operated gas meter going during the winter to provide heat for their home. In 1939, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio to join their father, who had a job with the Erie Railroad. Soon after though, Buck&#x27;s father died at the age of 49 due to uremic poisoning related to high blood pressure.

Buck planned to quit high school in 1941 to take a full-time job in an effort to support his family. Dissuaded by one of his teachers, Buck decided to finish high school, graduating from Lakewood High School in the winter of 1942. After graduation, he followed one of his friends and began working on an iron ore freight boat operated on the Great Lakes by the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company.

Buck served on a steamer named &quot;The Sheadle&quot;, where he began as porter and was later promoted to night cook and baker. After performing various other shipping related jobs, Buck attempted to become a &quot;deck watch.&quot; A required physical examination revealed Buck was color blind, unable to differentiate between the colors green and brown. Ineligible for the promotion to deck watch, Buck subsequently became eligible for the military draft, and was drafted into the United States Army in June 1943.

After completion of his military service in 1946, Buck enrolled at (and graduated from) Ohio State University. His early sportscasting career included work for the minor league affiliates of the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1954, he was promoted to radio play-by-play of Cardinal games on KXOK radio; the team&#x27;s radio broadcasts would move in 1955 to KMOX. Buck maintained this position for nearly all of the next 47 years. He was known in St. Louis for his trademark phrase &quot;That&#x27;s a winner!&quot;, which was said after every game that the Cardinals had won.

In addition to his work with the Cardinals, Buck also earned assignments on many national sportscasts, including radio coverage of 18 Super Bowls and 11 World Series. Some of his famous play-by-play calls include the dramatic walk-off home runs hit by Ozzie Smith in Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series, by Kirk Gibson in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, and by Kirby Puckett in Game 6 of the 1991 World Series.

The later part of his career found him working side by side in the Cardinals booth with his son Joe Buck, who also has risen to national sportscasting prominence.

==Military service==
After graduating from high school, he worked on large shipping boats that traveled the Great Lakes. Buck was drafted into the U.S. Army in June 1943. The physicality of Buck&#x27;s work on the Great Lakes left in him good physical condition at the time he entered the Army. Buck, who was 19 years old, stood tall, and weighed . His first assignment was anti-aircraft training, and was sent to Fort Eustis, Virginia to undergo his 13-week basic training regimen.

After completing his basic training in 1943, Buck was designated as an instructor, and assigned the rank of corporal. In addition to his instructor duties, Buck participated in boxing as a form of recreation. In February 1945, Buck shipped out to the European theater of the war, where he was assigned to K Company, 47th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division.

During the night of March 7, 1945, Buck and his compatriots crossed the Ludendorff Bridge at the town of Remagen, Germany. United States forces&#x27; successful capture of this bridge led to the Battle of Remagen from March 7–25. On the morning of March 15, Buck was the squad leader of a patrol that came under German fire in the Remagen zone. Wounded in his left forearm and leg by fragmentation, Buck received medical treatment on the battlefield from the only medic K company had at that time, Frank Borghi. He received further medical treatment at the 177th General Army Hospital in Le Mans, France, where he was awarded the Purple Heart. Buck recovered, and rejoined his outfit sometime after German forces had surrendered.

Declining to re-enlist, and turning down requests to enroll in the Officers Training School, Buck joined his compatriots in guard duty of German prisoners of war. Buck received orders to ship home in April 1946, effectively ending his military service.

==College==

After returning to the United States, Buck worked in various industrial-related jobs. When his friend Bill Theil told Buck he needed a roommate to attend Ohio State University with him, Buck decided on the spot to join Theil and enroll at Ohio State in Columbus. The suddenness of Buck&#x27;s decision meant he had no corresponding paperwork that could be used to formally enroll at the university, so Buck attended classes of his own choosing until he was able to formally enroll.

Buck majored in radio speech and minored in Spanish. He worked several jobs while attending college, including one position at an all-night gas station. He crafted his play-by-play skills broadcasting Ohio State basketball games.

After college, he called games for the Columbus Red Birds, a Triple-A (American Association) affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, in 1950–51. He spent the 1953 season as voice of another AAA Cardinals affiliate, the International League Rochester Red Wings on WHEC radio. His work there earned him an invitation to join the big-league Cardinals&#x27; broadcast team in St. Louis the following season.

==Broadcasting career==
===St. Louis Cardinals===

Buck started broadcasting Cardinals games for KMOX radio in 1954, teaming with Harry Caray, Milo Hamilton (1954), and Joe Garagiola (from 1955). Buck was dropped from the Cardinals booth in 1959 to make room for Buddy Blattner; the following year, he called Saturday &quot;Game of the Week&quot; telecasts for ABC. Buck was re-hired by the Cardinals in 1961 after Blattner departed; Garagiola left after 1962, leaving Caray and Buck as the team&#x27;s broadcast voices from 1963 through 1969.

After Caray was fired by the Cardinals following the 1969 season, Buck ascended to the team&#x27;s lead play-by-play role (1969 was also the year that Jack Buck divorced his first wife Alyce Larson—whom he had married in 1948 and had six children with—and married his second wife, Carole Lintzenich, who gave birth to their son Joe Buck in the same year).

Buck teamed with ex-Yankees and Pirates announcer Jim Woods in 1970–71. In 1972, retired Cardinals third baseman Mike Shannon joined Buck in the broadcast booth, beginning a 28-year partnership. On Cardinals broadcasts, Buck routinely punctuated St. Louis victories with the expression, &quot;That&#x27;s a winner!&quot;

In addition to Joe, Buck has three daughters who worked in broadcasting. Two are from his first marriage - Bonnie Buck, who currently works in television in Los Angeles, and Christine Buck, who started her career at KPLR-TV in St. Louis. From his second marriage is Julie Buck on KYKY 98.1 in St. Louis (she now works at KTRS-AM 550, also in St. Louis). In addition, Buck&#x27;s younger brother, Bob Buck was a sportscaster and sports director at KMOX/KMOV-TV in St. Louis.

Buck was well-respected in the St. Louis community, where he lived and regularly volunteered time to host charity events. In addition to his sportscasting work, Buck served as the original host of the KMOX interview/call-in program &quot;At Your Service&quot; beginning in 1960. His guests on the program included Eleanor Roosevelt.

Buck can be heard calling a (fictional) 1964 Cardinals broadcast in the 1988 film &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;, and makes a cameo appearance in a 1998 episode of the television series &quot;Arliss&quot;. He also lent his voice to &quot;R.B.I. Baseball &#x27;95&quot;.

===Football===
Jack Buck was also a renowned football broadcaster. In 1964, he began calling National Football League games for CBS television, following a four-year stint doing telecasts of the rival American Football League for ABC, which included the 1962 AFL Championship game between the Houston Oilers and the Dallas Texans—at that point the longest game ever played. Buck called Chicago Bears games in his first two CBS seasons, then switched to Dallas Cowboys games, including the famous &quot;Ice Bowl&quot; championship game in 1967. After the network moved away from dedicated team announcers, Buck continued to call regional NFL action through 1974, as well as several NFC Championship Games and Super Bowl IV. He also called the 1965 Cotton Bowl Classic for CBS television and several later Cotton Bowl games for CBS Radio.

In 1975, Buck temporarily left his Cardinals baseball duties in order to host the NBC pregame show, &quot;GrandStand&quot;, alongside Bryant Gumbel. In the 1976 and 1977 seasons, he called regional NFL play-by-play for NBC. On August 16, 1976, Buck called the first-ever NFL game played outside of the United States, a preseason exhibition between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Chargers held at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan. (Buck also worked NBC&#x27;s backup &quot;Game of the Week&quot; during the 1976 baseball season before returning to the Cardinals full-time in 1977.)

Buck served as the CBS Radio voice of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; (teaming with Hank Stram) for nearly two decades (1978–1984 and again from 1987–1995 after CBS regained the radio rights from NBC). Ironically, in 1970 ABC&#x27;s Roone Arledge had asked via telephone about Buck&#x27;s interests in becoming the first television play-by-play announcer for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, but because of personal animosity surrounding his previous stint with the network, Buck would not return their phone call. (The television play-by-play role would go to Keith Jackson instead, and later to Buck&#x27;s CBS colleague, Frank Gifford.)

In addition to &quot;MNF&quot;, Buck called numerous playoff games for CBS Radio, including 17 Super Bowls (the most of any announcer). Buck also served as a local radio broadcaster for the football Cardinals in 1980 and 1981, and returned to calling Sunday NFL games for CBS television from 1982 to 1987.

Late in the 1990 NFL season, Buck&#x27;s onetime CBS broadcasting partner, Pat Summerall, was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer after vomiting on a plane during a flight after a game, and was out for a considerable amount of time. While Verne Lundquist replaced Summerall on games with lead analyst John Madden, Buck (who was at the time the network&#x27;s lead Major League Baseball announcer) filled in for Lundquist, teaming with Dan Fouts to call two games (both of which coincidentally featured the Cardinals, who had moved from St. Louis to Arizona by that time).

===Other sports===
While much better known for his baseball and football commentary, Jack Buck was also the original voice of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League. Buck was paired with Jay Randolph and Gus Kyle on Blues broadcasts and covered the 1968 Stanley Cup Finals for KMOX radio.

He was succeeded after one season by broadcaster Dan Kelly. Buck also broadcast for the St. Louis Hawks and Rochester Royals of the National Basketball Association, and called professional wrestling, boxing, and bowling at various times in his career.

Showing his versatility, Buck also hosted the syndicated Top Star Bowling during the early 1960s.

===ABC and CBS baseball===

In , Buck along with Carl Erskine broadcast a series of late-afternoon Saturday games on ABC. They were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season.

Despite temporarily losing the &quot;Game of the Week&quot; package in 1961, ABC still televised several games in prime time (with Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth&#x27;s regular season home run record of 60.

For a number of years Buck called baseball events nationally for the CBS Radio network, teaming with Brent Musburger to call the All-Star Game in 1976 and with Jerry Coleman to call the NLCS from 1979–1982. From 1983–1989, Buck variously teamed with Sparky Anderson, Bill White, and Johnny Bench to call World Series radio broadcasts on CBS Radio, including appearances by the Cardinals in 1985 and 1987. (As a Cardinals announcer, Buck had previously called the World Series in 1968 (on NBC Radio) and 1982 (locally on KMOX).) Buck, along with his CBS Radio colleagues Johnny Bench and John Rooney, was on hand at San Francisco&#x27;s Candlestick Park on October 17, 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit. After the 6.9 magnitude quake rocked the Bay Area, Buck told the listening audience:

He is most famous for his coast-to-coast radio call of Kirk Gibson&#x27;s game-winning home run in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series and his disbelief at Gibson knocking it out while hobbled by injuries to his right hamstring and left knee. His call of the play is so famous that it is sometimes played over the television footage of the play. The television call was handled by long-time Dodgers announcer Vin Scully on NBC.

This was Buck&#x27;s call. It begins here with Buck speculating on what might happen if Gibson manages to reach base:

The last sentence is often remembered and quoted by fans. Buck followed it with,

Buck concluded his comments on Gibson&#x27;s amazing feat with this thought:

Buck was not intended to be the main play-by-play announcer for CBS baseball telecasts when the network acquired the sport from NBC and ABC. Originally assigned to the network&#x27;s #2 crew (and therefore, work with Jim Kaat), he was promoted at practically the last minute after Brent Musburger was fired on April Fools&#x27; Day of 1990.

After two years of calling baseball telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon &quot;Game of the Week&quot;, All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck&#x27;s ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst Tim McCarver.

Buck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that &quot;CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, &#x27;Let McCarver run the show ... In television, all they want you to do is shut up. I&#x27;m not very good at shutting up.&quot; Buck was criticized by some for his alleged habit of predicting plays on air.

Buck made controversial statements about singer Bobby Vinton prior to Game 4 of the 1990 National League Championship Series. After Vinton muffed the lyrics of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; in his home town of Pittsburgh, Buck lightly referenced Vinton&#x27;s Polish heritage (&quot;Well, when you&#x27;re Polish &amp; live in Pittsburgh, you can do anything you want with the words!&quot;). Buck soon got death threats from Pittsburgh Pirates fans, who even went as far as leaving a footprint on Buck&#x27;s hotel pillow.

The next day, CBS Sports executive producer Ted Shaker spotted Buck in the hotel lobby and told Buck that he was in trouble. The final baseball play that Jack Buck narrated for CBS television was Gene Larkin&#x27;s game winning bloop single in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.

==Final years==
Over the course of the 1990s, Buck decided to reduce his schedule to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence). Health concerns played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, diabetes, requiring a pacemaker, cataracts, sciatica, and vertigo. Buck once joked, &quot;I wish I&#x27;d get Alzheimer&#x27;s, then I could forget I&#x27;ve got all the other stuff.&quot; In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck&#x27;s, with the restaurant&#x27;s name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie.

In the final years of his life, Buck became recognized for writing poetry, culminating in national attention for his poem &quot;For America&quot;, written after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. One of Buck&#x27;s final public appearances was on September 17, 2001, at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It was the first night that Major League Baseball resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11. Sick with lung cancer and also showing the signs of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Buck looked frail and struggled to maintain his composure. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: &quot;I don&#x27;t know about you, but as for me, the question has already been answered: Should we be here? Yes!&quot;

==Death==

Jack Buck died on June 18, 2002, in St. Louis&#x27;s Barnes-Jewish Hospital from a combination of illnesses. He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for lung cancer, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and to correct an intestinal blockage.

Within two hours of his death, fans were leaving flowers at the base of his bust outside Busch Stadium even though it was the middle of the night. The flags at St. Louis City Hall and the St. Louis County Government Center were lowered to half-staff, the local television news anchors all wore black suits for the next several days, and a public visitation was held in the stadium before the next baseball game after his death, with free admission to the game for all the mourners who filed past his coffin.

Buck was interred at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in south St. Louis County. His spot on the KMOX Cardinals broadcasts was subsequently filled by former Colorado Rockies announcer Wayne Hagin. Hagin, who went on to the New York Mets after his stint in St. Louis, moved over to television, and his spot was filled by one of Buck&#x27;s protégés, former Chicago White Sox announcer John Rooney.

Buck&#x27;s youngest son, Joe, read the eulogy at his father&#x27;s church funeral. Jack Buck was married twice and had eight children in all; five daughters and three sons. Joe Buck was the lead play-by-play announcer for both Major League Baseball and the NFL on the Fox network. Joe Buck has also done occasional local telecasts for the Cardinals as well as commercials for a local automobile dealership. Jack and Joe Buck are also the only father and son to call play-by-play of Super Bowl telecasts. The pair bookended a 50-year championship drought for the Kansas City Chiefs, with Joe announcing the team&#x27;s victory in Super Bowl LIV.

During postseason telecasts, Joe has often paid homage to his father by signing off with &quot;We&#x27;ll see you tomorrow night!&quot;. When the Cardinals won the 2006 World Series, Joe quoted his father again saying, &quot;For the first time since , St. Louis has a World Series winner!&quot;, referencing Jack&#x27;s line when the Cards won in 1982, &quot;And that&#x27;s a winner! That&#x27;s a winner! A World Series winner for the Cardinals!&quot;. During the 2011 Series, Joe punctuated David Freese&#x27;s 11th inning walk-off homer for the Cardinals in Game 6 with &quot;We will see you ... tomorrow night!&quot;, near similar to the 1991 Puckett home run description, a call he said he did to celebrate his father. When the Cardinals won Game 7, he did not quote his father.

==Awards and recognition==
Buck received the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasting from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987, and the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

The Missouri Sports Hall of Fame inducted Buck twice, as a media personality (1980) and Missouri sports legend (2000). The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Buck as Missouri Sportscaster of the Year 22 times, and inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1990. Buck was also inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame in 1990, the Missouri Athletic Club Hall of Fame in 1993, the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995, and the NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2005. The American Sportscasters Association ranked Buck 11th in its listing of the Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time in 2009.

Buck is honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

A bronze statue of him was erected at the entrance to Busch Memorial Stadium in 1998 (and moved to a new location outside the current Busch Stadium in 2007).

A section of I-64/US-40 in St. Louis is named the Jack Buck Memorial Highway in his honor.

In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Buck among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

The Jack Buck Award, presented by the Missouri Athletic Club &quot;in recognition of the enthusiastic and dedicated support of sports in St. Louis&quot;, is named in his honor.

<text>The Guadalcanal campaign, also known as the Battle of Guadalcanal and codenamed Operation Watchtower by the United States, was an Allied offensive against forces of the Empire of Japan in the Solomon Islands during the Pacific Theater of World War II. It was fought between 7 August 1942 and 9 February 1943, and involved major land and naval battles on and surrounding the island of Guadalcanal. It was the first major Allied land offensive against Japan during the war.

In summer 1942, the Allies decided to mount major offensives in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands with the objectives of defending sea lines to Australia and eventually attacking the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. The Guadalcanal operation was under the command of Robert L. Ghormley, reporting to Chester W. Nimitz, while the Japanese defense consisted of the Combined Fleet under Isoroku Yamamoto and the Seventeenth Army under Harukishi Hyakutake.

On 7 August 1942, Allied forces, predominantly U.S. Marines, landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Island in the southern Solomon Islands. The Japanese defenders, who had occupied the islands since May 1942, offered little initial resistance, but the capture of Guadalcanal soon turned into a lengthy campaign as both sides added reinforcements. The Allies captured and completed Henderson Field on Guadalcanal and established a defense perimeter. The Japanese made several attempts to retake the airfield, including in mid-September and in late October. The campaign also involved major naval battles, including the Battles of Savo Island, the Eastern Solomons, Cape Esperance, and the Santa Cruz Islands, culminating in a decisive Allied victory at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in mid-November. Further engagements took place at the Battle of Tassafaronga and Battle of Rennell Island. In December, the Japanese decided to abandon Guadalcanal to focus on the defense of the other Solomon Islands, and evacuated their last forces by 9 February 1943. 

The campaign followed the successful Allied defensive actions at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway in May and June 1942. Along with the battles at Milne Bay and Buna–Gona on New Guinea, the Guadalcanal campaign marked the Allies&#x27; transition from defensive operations to offensive ones, and effectively allowed them to seize the strategic initiative in the Pacific theater from the Japanese. The campaign was followed by other major Allied offensives in the Pacific, most notably: the Solomon Islands campaign, New Guinea campaign, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Philippines campaign of 1944 to 1945, and the Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign prior to the surrender of Japan in August 1945.

==Background==

===Strategic considerations===
On 7 December 1941, Japanese forces attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack killed almost 2,500 people and crippled much of the U.S. battleship fleet, precipitating formal declarations of war between the two nations the next day. The initial goals of the Japanese leadership were to neutralize the U.S. Navy, seize territories rich in natural resources, and establish strategic military bases with which to defend Japan&#x27;s empire in the Pacific Ocean and Asia. Initially, Japanese forces captured the Philippines, Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, Wake Island, Gilbert Islands, New Britain and Guam. The U.S. was joined in the war against Japan by several of the Allied powers, including the British Empire and the Dutch government-in-exile, both of which had also been attacked by Japan.

The Japanese made two attempts to continue their offensive and extend their outer defensive perimeter in the south and central Pacific to a point at which they could threaten Australia, Hawaii, and the U.S. west coast. The first offensive was thwarted in the naval Battle of the Coral Sea, which was a tactical stalemate but a strategic Allied victory in retrospect. It was the Allies&#x27; first major victory against the Japanese and significantly reduced the offensive capability of Japan&#x27;s carrier forces. However, the battle did not temper Japan&#x27;s audacious offensive military posture for several crucial months, with Japanese forces attempting a failed attack on Port Moresby over the Kokoda track. The second major Japanese offensive was stopped at the Battle of Midway. Both sides suffered significant losses in carrier aircraft and aircrew during these engagements. Crucially, while the Americans were able to reconstitute their naval air strength in relatively short order, the Japanese ultimately proved unable to do so. These strategic victories allowed the Allies to transition to a more offensive stance in the Pacific theater, and attempt to seize the strategic initiative from Japan.

The Allies chose the Solomon Islands (a protectorate of the United Kingdom), specifically the southern islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi and Florida Island, as their first target, designated Task One (codename &quot;Pestilence&quot;), with the initial objectives of occupying the Santa Cruz Islands (codename &quot;Huddle&quot;), Tulagi (codename &quot;Watchtower&quot;), and &quot;adjacent positions&quot;. Guadalcanal (codename &quot;Cactus&quot;), which eventually became the focus of the operation, was not even mentioned in the early directive, and only later took on the operation name &quot;Watchtower&quot;. Tulagi, although small, had a large natural harbor that was ideal for a float-plane base; Florida Island also had to be taken, as it dominated Tulagi. Guadalcanal, much larger than the other two islands and located to the south across the soon-to-be-named Ironbottom Sound, was added when it was discovered the Japanese were constructing an airbase there.

The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had occupied Tulagi in May 1942 and had constructed a seaplane base nearby. Allied concern grew when, in early July, the IJN began constructing a large airfield at Lunga Point on nearby Guadalcanal. From such a base, Japanese long-range bombers could threaten the sea lines of communication and maritime trade &amp; transportation routes from the west coast of the Americas to the populous east coast of Australia. By August, the Japanese had about 900 naval troops on Tulagi and nearby islands, and 2,800 personnel (including 2,200 Korean forced laborers and trustees, as well as Japanese construction specialists) on Guadalcanal. These bases were meant to protect Japan&#x27;s major naval base at Rabaul, threaten Allied supply and communication lines, and establish a staging area for a planned offensive against Fiji, New Caledonia and Samoa (&quot;Operation FS&quot;). The Japanese planned to deploy 45 fighters and 60 bombers to Guadalcanal. In the overall strategy for 1942, these aircraft would provide ground-based air cover for Japanese naval forces advancing farther into the South Pacific.

The Allied plan to invade the southern Solomons was conceived by U.S. Admiral Ernest King, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet. He proposed the offensive in order to deny the use of the islands to the Japanese as bases from which the supply routes between the United States and Australia could be threatened, and to use them as starting points for further Allied offensives in the South Pacific. With U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s tacit consent, King also advocated for an invasion of Guadalcanal. Due to the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s support for Great Britain&#x27;s proposal that priority be given to defeating Germany before Japan, Allied commanders in Pacific theater had to compete for personnel and resources with the European theater.

An early obstacle was the desire of both the U.S. Army and the Roosevelt administration to initiate offensive action in Europe prior to a large-scale operation in the Pacific. In addition, it was initially unclear who would command the campaign: Tulagi lay in the area under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, whereas the Santa Cruz Islands lay in Admiral Chester W. Nimitz&#x27;s Pacific Ocean Area, which would also supply almost all Allied offensive forces that would be staged, supplied and covered from that area. Both problems were overcome, and the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General George C. Marshall, gave the operation his full support, despite MacArthur&#x27;s command being unable to directly assist in the operation and the U.S. Navy taking full operational responsibility. As a result, and in order to preserve the unity of command, the boundary between MacArthur&#x27;s South West Pacific Area and Nimitz&#x27;s Pacific Ocean Area was shifted to to the west, effective from 1 August 1942.

Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief William D. Leahy established two goals for 1942–1943: first, that Guadalcanal would be taken, in conjunction with an Allied offensive in New Guinea under MacArthur; and second, that the Admiralty Islands and Bismarck Archipelago, including the major Japanese base at Rabaul, would be captured as well. The directive held that the eventual goal was the American reconquest of the Philippines, from which American forces had been evicted in early 1942. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff created the South Pacific theater, with Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley taking command on 19 June, to direct the offensive in the Solomons. Nimitz, based at Pearl Harbor, was designated as overall Allied commander-in-chief for Allied forces in the Pacific.

===Task force===

In preparation for the offensive in the Pacific in May 1942, U.S. Marine Major General Alexander Vandegrift was ordered to move his 1st Marine Division from the United States to New Zealand. Other Allied land, naval and air units were sent to establish or reinforce bases in Fiji, Samoa, New Hebrides and New Caledonia.

The island of Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, was selected as the headquarters and primary staging ground for the offensive, codenamed &quot;Operation Watchtower&quot;, with the commencement date set for 7 August. At first, only the seizure of Tulagi and the Santa Cruz Islands was planned, omitting a landing on Guadalcanal. After Allied reconnaissance discovered Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal, its capture was added to the plan, and planned landings on the Santa Cruz islands were (eventually) abandoned. The Japanese were aware, via signals intelligence, of the large-scale movement of Allied forces in the South Pacific Area, but concluded that the Allies were reinforcing either Australia or Port Moresby on the southern coast of New Guinea.

The &quot;Watchtower&quot; force, numbering 75 warships and transports (including vessels from the U.S. and Australia), assembled near Fiji on 26 July and conducted a single rehearsal landing prior to leaving for Guadalcanal on 31 July. The commander of the Allied expeditionary force was U.S. Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher, Commander of Task Force 61 (whose flag was on the aircraft carrier ). Commanding the amphibious forces was U.S. Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner. Vandegrift led the 16,000 Allied (primarily U.S. Marine) infantry earmarked for the amphibious landings. The troops sent to Guadalcanal were fresh from military training, armed with legacy bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifles and a meager 10-day supply of ammunition. Because of the need to get the troops into battle quickly, the Allied planners had reduced their supplies from 90 days to only 60. The men of the 1st Marine Division began referring to the coming battle as &quot;Operation Shoestring&quot;.

==Events==

===Landings===

Bad weather allowed the Allied expeditionary force to arrive unseen by the Japanese on the night of 6 August and morning of 7 August, taking the defenders by surprise. This is occasionally referred to the &quot;Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal&quot;. A Japanese patrol aircraft from Tulagi had searched the general area that the Allied invasion fleet was moving through, but was unable to spot the Allied fleet due to severe storms and heavy clouds. The landing force split into two groups, with one group assaulting Guadalcanal and the other Tulagi, Florida, and other nearby islands. Allied warships bombarded the invasion beaches, while U.S. carrier aircraft bombed Japanese positions on the target islands and destroyed 15 Japanese seaplanes at their base near Tulagi.

Tulagi and two nearby small islands, Gavutu and Tanambogo, were assaulted by 3,000 U.S. Marines under the command of Brigadier General William Rupertus. The 886 IJN personnel manning the naval and seaplane bases on the three islands fiercely resisted the Marine landings. With some difficulty, the Marines secured all three islands: Tulagi on 8 August, and Gavutu and Tanambogo by 9 August. The Japanese defenders were killed almost to the last man, and the Marines suffered 248 casualties.
In contrast to Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo, the landings on Guadalcanal encountered much less resistance. At 09:10 on 7 August, Vandegrift and 11,000 U.S. Marines came ashore on Guadalcanal between Koli Point and Lunga Point. Advancing towards Lunga Point, they encountered scant Japanese resistance and secured the airfield by 16:00 on 8 August. The Japanese naval construction units and combat troops, under the command of Captain Kanae Monzen, had panicked after coming under naval bombardment and aerial bombing, and had abandoned the airfield and fled about west to the Matanikau River and Point Cruz area. Japanese troops left behind food, supplies, intact construction equipment and vehicles, and 13 dead at the airfield and surrounding area.

During the landing operations on 7 and 8 August, Rabaul-based Japanese naval aircraft under the command of Yamada Sadayoshi attacked the Allied amphibious forces several times, setting fire the transport (which sank two days later) and heavily damaging the destroyer . Over the course of two days of air attacks, Japanese air units lost 36 aircraft, while the U.S. lost 19 (including 14 carrier aircraft), both in combat and to accidents.

After these aerial clashes, Fletcher became concerned about the unexpectedly high losses to his carrier fighter aircraft strength, anxious about the threat to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships&#x27; remaining fuel supply. Fletcher withdrew from the Solomon Islands area with his carrier task force on the evening of 8 August. As a result of the loss of carrier-based air cover, Turner decided to withdraw his ships from Guadalcanal, even though less than half of the supplies and heavy equipment needed by the troops ashore had been unloaded. Turner planned to unload as many supplies as possible on Guadalcanal and Tulagi throughout the night of 8 August, and then depart with his ships early on 9 August.

===Battle of Savo Island===
As the transports continued to unload on the night of 8–9 August, two groups of screening Allied cruisers and destroyers, under the command of British Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, were surprised and defeated by a Japanese force of seven cruisers and one destroyer from the 8th Fleet based at Rabaul and Kavieng, commanded by Japanese Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa. The 8th fleet had been sighted at least 5 times over the course of the previous days, both by Allied submarines and aerial reconnaissance, but a combination of misidentification of ships and the Allied leadership&#x27;s dismissal of Japanese night fighting capability contributed to an air of complacence and ignorance among the Allied surface fleet that proved disastrous. Japanese submarine activity and air attack continued to be the main source of concern to Turner and his staff, not the threat of Japanese surface action. 

As a result, during the Battle of Savo Island on the night of 9 August, Mikawa&#x27;s force was able to surprise and sink one Australian and three American cruisers, as well as damage another American cruiser and two destroyers. The Japanese suffered only moderate damage to one cruiser. Despite this success, Mikawa was unaware that Fletcher was preparing to withdraw with the U.S. aircraft carriers, and immediately retired to Rabaul without attempting to attack the (now defenseless) Allied transports, fearing daytime air attacks on his vessels once the cover of darkness had been lost. Bereft of his carrier air cover and concerned about Japanese submarine &amp; surface attacks against his degraded fleet, Turner decided to withdraw his badly mauled naval forces from the area on evening of 9 August. This left the Marines ashore understrength (as some transports in the Allied fleet had retreated without disembarking all of their troops), and without much of their heavy equipment and provisions. Mikawa&#x27;s decision not to attempt to destroy the Allied transport ships when he had the opportunity proved to be a crucial strategic mistake.

===Initial ground operations===

The 11,000 Marines on Guadalcanal initially concentrated on forming a loose defensive perimeter centered around Lunga Point and the airfield, moving what supplies had been brought ashore within the perimeter, and completing the construction of the airfield. Over four days of intense effort, the supplies were moved from the landing beaches to dispersed dumps within the defensive perimeter. Work began on the airfield immediately, mainly using captured Japanese equipment. On 12 August the airfield was named Henderson Field after Lofton R. Henderson, a Marine aviator who was killed during the Battle of Midway. By 18 August the airfield was ready for operation. Five days&#x27; worth of food had been landed from the transports, which, along with captured Japanese provisions, gave the Marines a total of 14 days&#x27; supply of food. To conserve supplies, the troops were limited to two meals per day.

Allied troops encountered a severe strain of dysentery soon after the landings, with one in five Marines afflicted by mid-August. Although some of the Korean construction workers surrendered to the Marines, most of the remaining Japanese and Korean personnel gathered just west of the Lunga perimeter on the west bank of the Matanikau River and subsisted mainly on coconuts. A Japanese naval outpost was also located at Taivu Point, about 35 kilometers (22 mi) east of the Lunga perimeter. On 8 August, a Japanese destroyer from Rabaul delivered 113 naval reinforcement troops to the Matanikau position.

===Goettge patrol===
On the evening of 12 August, a 25-man U.S. Marine patrol, led by Division D-2 Lieutenant Colonel Frank Goettge and primarily consisting of intelligence personnel, landed by boat west of the U.S. Marine Lunga perimeter, east of Point Cruz and west of the Japanese perimeter at Matanikau River, on a reconnaissance mission with a secondary objective of contacting a group of Japanese troops that U.S. forces believed might be willing to surrender. Soon after the patrol landed, a nearby platoon of Japanese naval troops attacked it and almost completely wiped it out.

In response, on 19 August, Vandegrift sent three companies of the U.S. 5th Marine Regiment to attack the Japanese troop concentration west of the Matanikau. One company attacked across the sandbar at the mouth of the Matanikau River while another crossed the river inland and attacked the Japanese forces located in Matanikau village. The third landed by boat further west and attacked Kokumbuna village. After briefly occupying the two villages, the three Marine companies returned to the Lunga perimeter, having killed about 65 Japanese soldiers while losing four Marines. This action, sometimes referred to as the &quot;First Battle of the Matanikau&quot;, was the first of several major actions around the Matanikau River during the campaign.

On 20 August, the escort carrier delivered a squadron of 19 Grumman F4F Wildcats and a squadron of 12 Douglas SBD Dauntlesses to Henderson Field. The airfield&#x27;s rudimentary nature meant that carrier aircraft, designed for rough landings on flight decks at sea, were more suited for use on Henderson Field than ground-based planes. The aircraft based at Henderson became known as the &quot;Cactus Air Force&quot;, after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal, &quot;Cactus&quot;. The Marine fighters went into action the next day, which also saw the first of what would become almost-daily Japanese bomber air raids on the airfield. On 22 August five U.S. Army Bell P-400 Airacobras and their pilots arrived at Henderson Field.

===Battle of the Tenaru===

In response to the Allied landings, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the task of retaking Guadalcanal to the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s (IJA) 17th Army, a corps-sized command based at Rabaul under the command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake. The army was to be supported by Japanese naval units, including the Combined Fleet under the command of Isoroku Yamamoto, which was headquartered at Truk. The 17th Army, at that time heavily involved in the Japanese campaign in New Guinea, had only a few units available to allocate to Guadalcanal. Of these, the 35th Infantry Brigade under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi was at Palau, the 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment under Major General Yumio Nasu was in the Philippines and the 28th (Ichiki) Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki, was berthed on transport ships near Guam. These units began to move towards Guadalcanal via Truk and Rabaul immediately, but Ichiki&#x27;s regiment, being the closest, arrived in the area first. A &quot;First Element&quot; of Ichiki&#x27;s unit, consisting of about 917 soldiers, was landed by IJN destroyers at Taivu Point, east of the Lunga perimeter, after midnight on 19 August, then conducted a night march west toward the Marine perimeter.

Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, Ichiki&#x27;s unit conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek (often called the &quot;Ilu River&quot; on U.S. Marine maps) on the east side of the Lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of 21 August. Jacob Vouza, a Solomon Islands Coastwatcher scout, warned the Americans of the impending attack minutes before Ichiki&#x27;s assault, which was subsequently defeated with heavy losses to the Japanese. After daybreak, the Marine units counterattacked Ichiki&#x27;s surviving troops, killing many more of them. The dead included Ichiki, though it has been claimed that he committed seppuku after realizing the magnitude of his defeat, rather than dying in combat. In total, 789 of the original 917 members of the Ichiki Regiment&#x27;s First Element were killed in the battle. About 30 survived the battle and joined Ichiki&#x27;s rear guard of about 100, and these 128 Japanese returned to Taivu Point, notified 17th Army headquarters of their defeat and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul.

===Battle of the Eastern Solomons===

As the Tenaru battle was ending, more Japanese reinforcements were already on their way to Guadalcanal. Yamamoto had organized an extremely powerful naval expeditionary force, with goal of destroying any American fleet units in the Solomons, and subsequently eliminating Allied ground forces at Henderson Field. This force sortied from Truk on 23 August. Several other IJN units carrying reinforcements and supplies, as well as ships tasked with naval bombardment of the island, sortied from both Truk and Rabaul. Three slow transport ships departed from Truk on 16 August, carrying the remaining 1,400 soldiers from Ichiki&#x27;s (28th) Infantry Regiment plus 500 naval marines from the 5th Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force. The transports were guarded by 13 warships commanded by Japanese Rear Admiral Raizō Tanaka, who planned to land the troops on Guadalcanal on 24 August. To cover the landing of these troops and provide support for the operation to retake Henderson Field from Allied forces, Yamamoto directed Chūichi Nagumo to sortie with a carrier force from Truk on 21 August and sail toward the southern Solomon Islands. Nagumo&#x27;s force included three carriers and 30 other warships. Yamamoto would send the light carrier to act as bait, ahead of the rest of the Japanese fleet, in order to draw the attention of American pilots. The aircraft from the two fleet carriers would then attack the American fleet while it lacked air cover.

Simultaneously, the U.S. carrier task force under Fletcher approached Guadalcanal to counter the Japanese offensive efforts. On 24 August, the two carrier forces located and launched strikes against the other. The Japanese had two fleet carriers, the and , as well as the light carrier &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, with a total of 177 carrier-based aircraft. The American forces had two carriers, the &quot;Saratoga&quot; and , and their 176 aircraft. The Japanese light carrier &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, offered as bait to Allied naval aircraft, was hit by several bombs and an aerial torpedo; she was abandoned by her crew and sank that night. The two Japanese fleet carriers were not attacked, but Japanese aircraft successfully attacked &quot;Enterprise&quot;, badly damaging her flight deck. Both fleets subsequently retreated from the area. The Japanese lost the &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, along with dozens of carrier aircraft and most of their aircrew; meanwhile, the Americans lost a handful of planes and &quot;Enterprise&quot; was damaged, requiring two months to repair in Hawaii. Unable to safely land on &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; ruined flight deck, much of her remaining aircraft instead flew to Guadalcanal and reinforced the beleaguered American air units at Henderson Field. 

Concurrently to the carrier air battle, on 25 August, Tanaka&#x27;s convoy (headed by the flagship ) was attacked near Taivu Point by Cactus Air Force aircraft based at Henderson Field. After suffering heavy damage during the battle, including the sinking of one of the transports, the convoy was forced to divert to the Shortland Islands in the northern Solomons in order to transfer the surviving troops to destroyers for later delivery to Guadalcanal. A Japanese transport was sunk, and the older destroyer &quot;Mutsuki&quot; was so badly damaged that she had to be scuttled. Several other Japanese warships were damaged, including Tanaka&#x27;s flagship &quot;Jintsū&quot;. At this point, Tanaka withdrew and rescheduled the supply run for the night of 28 August, to be carried out by the remaining destroyers. Japanese air raids against the Allied positions on Guadalcanal continued largely unabated during this time.

On 25 August, the American carrier , after refueling, positioned herself east of Guadalcanal, expecting Japanese movement to the area. No Japanese forces made any movement towards the area, however, and the &quot;Wasp&quot; was left idle.

The Americans had won a modest tactical victory with the destruction of the &quot;Ryūjō,&quot; destroying some 75 Japanese aircraft while losing 25 of their own. The forced withdrawal of Tanaka&#x27;s troop convoy also bought valuable breathing room for the embattled Allied troops on Guadalcanal. While the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was taken out of action for repair for several months, she would return to sea later in the campaign. Regardless, the temporary loss of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was offset by the timely arrival of the carrier &quot;Hornet&quot;. Additionally, the reinforcement of Henderson Field by &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s orphaned carrier aircraft bolstered ground-based Allied air strength on the island, while ground-based Japanese pilots based at Rabaul were forced to undertake a grueling day-long round-trip flight in order to make their attacks. These factors combined to render daylight supply runs to Guadalcanal impossible for the Japanese. Only weeks before this, the Japanese had total control of the sea in the region; now they were forced to make supply runs only under the cover of darkness. Japanese naval commanders began to recognize the reality that their ships could not safely operate in the Solomons in the daytime without first suppressing Allied airpower at Henderson Field.

===Transport Division 12===
For six weeks, from early August to the end of September, the U.S. Navy largely avoided the waters off Tulagi and Guadalcanal, and was ordered not to resupply the Marines or provide escort duty for slow transport ships, as American naval commanders feared a repeat of the disastrous defeat at Savo Island suffered by Australian and American surface vessels on 9 August. Transport Division 12 (Trans Div 12), consisting of six obsolete World War I-era s converted to high-speed transports, were the most heavily armed U.S. surface ships operating in Ironbottom Sound during this time. Their torpedo tubes were retrofitted to hold landing craft boats, enough to carry over 100 extra Marines for rapid transportation. They landed the first Marines onto Tulagi and later on Guadalcanal, conducted special operations missions with Marine Raiders, participated in anti-submarine warfare, and provided covering fire for the Marines on Guadalcanal. They also directly delivered crucial supplies to the Marines that helped to construct Henderson Field and to maintain the aircraft stationed there.

On 30 August was bombed by Japanese high-altitude horizontal bombers and sank with the loss of 51 men. On 4–5 September, and had finished landing a complement of Marine Raiders back onto Guadalcanal and proceeded to patrol the area for submarines, which had been surfacing and shelling the Marines nightly. Three Japanese destroyers, who did not know that enemy surface ships were patrolling the area, positioned themselves to attack Henderson Field. These ships were spotted by two American destroyer-transports, who believed at first that they were a submarine. A U.S. patrol plane also misidentified the destroyers as an enemy submarine and dropped flares over the area, accidentally silhouetting &quot;Little&quot; and &quot;Gregory&quot; in the nighttime conditions. The Japanese destroyers immediately fired on and sunk the overmatched American ships. 65 men from &quot;Little&quot; were killed and 24 men from &quot;Gregory&quot; were killed, including the commanding officer of Transport Division 12 and the commanding officers of both ships.

===Air battles over Henderson Field and strengthening of the Lunga defenses===

Throughout August, small numbers of American aircraft and their crews continued to arrive at Guadalcanal. By the end of August, 64 planes of various types were stationed at Henderson Field. On 3 September, the commander of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, U.S. Marine Brigadier General Roy Geiger, arrived with his staff and took command of all air operations at Henderson Field. Air battles between the Allied aircraft at Henderson and Japanese bombers and fighters from Rabaul continued almost daily. Between 26 August and 5 September, the U.S. lost about 15 aircraft to the Japanese&#x27;s approximately 19. More than half of the U.S. aircrews shot down were rescued, while most of the Japanese aircrews were not recovered. The eight-hour round-trip flight from Rabaul to Guadalcanal, about , seriously hampered Japanese efforts to establish air superiority over Henderson Field. Throughout the campaign, Rabaul-based Japanese aircrew were forced to fly almost 600 miles before engaging in combat with Allied pilots operating in the immediate area of Henderson Field. This, combined with the fact that the Japanese navy did not systematically rotate their veteran pilots out of combat zones, steadily exhausted &amp; depleted Japanese airpower in the region. From a strategic standpoint, the overall quality of Japanese aviation in the Solomons deteriorated as worn-out veteran pilots were replaced by inexperienced aircrew with minimal combat experience. Australian coastwatchers on Bougainville and New Georgia islands were often able to provide Allied forces on Guadalcanal with advance notice of inbound Japanese air strikes, allowing the U.S. fighters time to take off and position themselves to attack the Japanese aircraft as they approached the island. The Japanese air forces were slowly losing a war of attrition in the skies above Guadalcanal.

During this time, Vandegrift continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the Lunga perimeter. Between 21 August and 3 September, he relocated three Marine battalions, including the 1st Raider Battalion, under Merritt A. Edson (Edson&#x27;s Raiders), and the 1st Parachute Battalion from Tulagi and Gavutu to Guadalcanal. These units added about 1,500 troops to Vandegrift&#x27;s original 11,000 men defending Henderson Field. The 1st Parachute Battalion, which had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo in August, was placed under Edson&#x27;s command.

The other relocated battalion, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, was landed by boat west of the Matanikau near Kokumbuna village on 27 August with the mission of attacking Japanese units in the area, much as in the first Matanikau action of 19 August. The Marines were impeded by difficult terrain, hot sun, and well-emplaced Japanese defenses. The next morning, the Marines found that the Japanese defenders had departed during the night, so the Marines returned to the Lunga perimeter by boat. These actions resulted in the loss of 20 Japanese and 3 Marines.

Small Allied naval convoys arrived at Guadalcanal on 23 and 29 August, and 1 and 8 September to provide the Marines at Lunga with more food, ammunition, aircraft fuel, aircraft technicians, and other supplies. The convoy on 1 September also brought 392 Seabees to maintain and improve Henderson Field. In addition, on 3 September, Marine Aircraft Group 25 began airlifting high-priority cargo, including personnel, aviation gasoline, munitions, and other supplies, to Henderson Field.

===Tokyo Express===

By 23 August, Kawaguchi&#x27;s 35th Infantry Brigade reached Truk and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to Guadalcanal. The damage done to Tanaka&#x27;s convoy during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons caused the Japanese to reconsider trying to deliver more troops to Guadalcanal via slow transport. Instead, the ships carrying Kawaguchi&#x27;s soldiers were rerouted to Rabaul. From there, the Japanese planned to deliver Kawaguchi&#x27;s unit to Guadalcanal using fast-moving destroyers at night, staging through a Japanese naval base in the Shortland Islands. The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make round trips down &quot;The Slot&quot; (New Georgia Sound) to Guadalcanal and back in a single night throughout the campaign, which minimized their exposure to daytime Allied air attack. These runs became known as the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; to Allied forces, and were labeled &quot;rat transportation&quot; by the Japanese. While troops could be transported in this manner, most of the heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, food and ammunition, could not. In addition, this activity tied up destroyers that the IJN desperately needed to escort convoys elsewhere in the Pacific. The Byzantine nature of the Japanese navy&#x27;s command setup in the region exacerbated these logistical problems; Tanaka was receiving contradictory orders from both the Combined Fleet headquarters as well as two rival subordinate naval commands at Rabaul, the Eleventh Air Fleet and the Eighth Fleet. Regardless, Tanaka&#x27;s persistent destroyer operations gradually increased the strength of the forces available to Kawaguchi on the island. A combination of inability and unwillingness prevented Allied naval commanders from frequently challenging Japanese naval forces at night, so the Japanese effectively controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands after sunset. Conversely, the growing Allied airpower at Henderson Field (which was further reinforced on September 11-12 by 24 Wildcats that had been made homeless by the torpedoing of the carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot; in early September by IJN submarine &quot;I-26&quot;) meant that any Japanese vessel within range () of Guadalcanal in daylight was at great risk from air attack. This tactical situation, wherein Japanese naval forces operated freely at night and Allied aircraft enjoyed local air superiority during the day, persisted for the next several months of the campaign.

Between 29 August and 4 September, Japanese light cruisers, destroyers, and patrol boats were able to land almost 5,000 troops at Taivu Point, including most of the 35th Infantry Brigade, much of the Aoba (4th) Regiment, and the rest of Ichiki&#x27;s regiment. General Kawaguchi, who landed at Taivu Point on 31 August, was placed in command of all Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. A barge convoy took another 1,000 soldiers of Kawaguchi&#x27;s brigade, under the command of Colonel Akinosuke Oka, to Kamimbo, west of the Lunga perimeter.

=== Battle of Edson&#x27;s Ridge ===
On 7 September, Kawaguchi issued his attack plan to &quot;rout and annihilate the enemy in the vicinity of the Guadalcanal Island airfield&quot;. Kawaguchi&#x27;s plan called for the forces under his command, split into three divisions, to approach the Lunga perimeter inland, culminating with a surprise night attack. Oka&#x27;s forces would attack the perimeter from the west, while Ichiki&#x27;s Second Echelon, renamed the Kuma Battalion, would attack from the east. The main attack would be conducted from the jungle south of the Lunga perimeter by Kawaguchi&#x27;s &quot;Center Body&quot;, numbering 3,000 men in three battalions. By 7 September, most of Kawaguchi&#x27;s troops had departed Taivu to begin marching towards Lunga Point along the coastline. About 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade&#x27;s supply base at Taivu.
Meanwhile, native scouts under the direction of Martin Clemens, a coastwatcher officer in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force and the British district officer for Guadalcanal, brought reports to the U.S. Marines of Japanese troops at Taivu near the village of Tasimboko. Edson subsequently planned a raid on the Japanese troop concentration at Taivu. On 8 September, after being dropped off near Taivu by boat, Edson&#x27;s men captured Tasimboko and forced the Japanese defenders to retreat into the jungle. In Tasimboko, Edson&#x27;s troops discovered Kawaguchi&#x27;s main supply depot, including large stockpiles of food, ammunition, medical supplies, and a powerful shortwave radio. After destroying everything in sight, aside from some documents and equipment that were carried back with them, the Marines returned to the Lunga perimeter. Intelligence gathered from the captured documents indicated that at least 3,000 Japanese troops were on the island, planning to initiate a large-scale ground assault on the airfield in short order.

Edson, along with Colonel Gerald C. Thomas, Vandegrift&#x27;s operations officer, correctly anticipated that the main Japanese attack would fall upon Lunga Ridge, a narrow, grassy, coral ridge that ran parallel to the Lunga River, just south of Henderson Field. The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area, and was almost undefended. On 11 September, the 840 men of Edson&#x27;s battalion were deployed onto and around the ridge and began digging in.

On the night of 12 September, Kawaguchi&#x27;s 1st Battalion attacked the Raiders between the Lunga River and ridge, forcing one Marine company to fall back to the ridge before the Japanese halted their attack for the night. The next night Kawaguchi faced Edson&#x27;s 840 Raiders with 3,000 troops of his brigade, reinforced by an assortment of light artillery. The Japanese began their attack just after nightfall, with Kawaguchi&#x27;s 1st Battalion assaulting Edson&#x27;s right flank just to the west of the ridge. After breaking through the Marine lines, the battalion&#x27;s assault was eventually stopped by Marine units occupying the northern section of the ridge.

Two companies from Kawaguchi&#x27;s 2nd Battalion charged up the southern edge of the ridge and pushed Edson&#x27;s troops back to Hill 123, in the center section of the ridge. Throughout the night the Marines at this position, supported by a battery of howizers brought up from Lunga Point, turned back wave after wave of frontal Japanese infantry attacks, several of which devolved into hand-to-hand combat. The weight of these repeated assaults eventually pressed the Marines back to within a quarter mile of the airfield. At this stage, as the intensity of the battle reached its apex, small groups of Japanese soldiers managed to break through Edson&#x27;s lines, with some reaching the edge of the airfield itself. Several Japanese soldiers were killed as they attempted to climb onto and destroy parked aircraft, and General Vandegrift&#x27;s command post even came under direct attack at dawn, with several Japanese infiltrators killed within sight of the general. Nonetheless, Kawaguchi&#x27;s units were spent, and the main Japanese attack on Edson&#x27;s positions ground to a halt. The supporting attacks by the Kuma Battalion and Oka&#x27;s unit at other locations on the Lunga perimeter were likewise defeated. On 14 September, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade on a five-day march west to the Matanikau Valley to join with Oka&#x27;s unit. In total Kawaguchi&#x27;s forces lost about 850 killed, with the Marines suffering 104.

On 15 September at Rabaul, Hyakutake learned of Kawaguchi&#x27;s defeat and forwarded the news to Imperial General Headquarters in Japan. In an emergency meeting, the senior Japanese IJA and IJN command staffs concluded that &quot;Guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war&quot;. The results of the battle now began to exert significant strategic impact on Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific. Hyakutake realized that he could not send sufficient men and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal while simultaneously supporting the major ongoing Japanese offensive on the Kokoda Track in New Guinea. Hyakutake, with the concurrence of General Headquarters, ordered his troops on New Guinea, who were within of their objective of Port Moresby, to withdraw until the &quot;Guadalcanal matter&quot; was resolved. Hyakutake prepared to send more troops to Guadalcanal for another attempt to recapture Henderson Field.

===Allied reinforcement===
As the Japanese regrouped west of the Matanikau, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 14 September Vandegrift moved another battalion (3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment) from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the 7th Marine Regiment plus a battalion from the 11th Marine Regiment and some additional support units), 137 vehicles, tents, aviation fuel, ammunition, rations, and engineering equipment to Guadalcanal. These crucial reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on 19 September, to establish an unbroken line of defense around the Lunga perimeter. While covering this convoy, the aircraft carrier was scuttled after being struck by torpedoes from the Japanese submarine southeast of Guadalcanal. This stretched Allied naval airpower thin, with only one aircraft carrier () remaining in operation in the entire South Pacific Area. Vandegrift also made some changes in the senior leadership of his combat units, transferring several officers who did not meet his performance standards off the island and promoting junior officers who had proven themselves to take their place. One of these was the recently promoted Colonel Merritt Edson, who was placed in command of the 5th Marine Regiment.

A lull occurred in the air war over Guadalcanal, with no Japanese air raids between 14 and 27 September because of bad weather, during which both sides reinforced their respective air units. The Japanese delivered 85 fighters and bombers to their air units at Rabaul, while the U.S. sent a further 23 fighters and attack aircraft to Henderson Field. By 20 September the Japanese had 117 total aircraft at Rabaul, while the Allies tallied 71 aircraft at Henderson Field. The air war resumed with a Japanese air raid on Guadalcanal on 27 September, which was contested by U.S. Navy and Marine fighters from Henderson Field.

The Japanese immediately began to prepare for their next attempt to recapture Henderson Field. The 3rd Battalion, 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment had landed at Kamimbo Bay on the western end of Guadalcanal on 11 September - too late to join Kawaguchi&#x27;s attack, but in time to join Oka&#x27;s forces near the Matanikau. Tokyo Express runs by IJN destroyers on 14, 20, 21 and 24 September brought food and ammunition as well as 280 men from the 1st Battalion, Aoba Regiment, to Kamimbo Bay. Meanwhile, the Japanese 2nd and 38th Infantry Divisions were transported from the Dutch East Indies to Rabaul, beginning on 13 September. The Japanese planned to transport a total of 17,500 troops from these two divisions to Guadalcanal to take part in the next major attack on the Lunga perimeter by late October.

===Actions along the Matanikau===
Vandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi&#x27;s troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau, and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift therefore decided to conduct another series of small unit operations around the Matanikau Valley. Their purpose was to mop up scattered groups of Japanese troops east of the Matanikau and to keep the main body of Japanese soldiers off-balance, preventing them from consolidating positions so close to the main Marine defenses at Lunga Point.

An attack on Japanese forces west of the Matanikau was conducted between 23 and 27 September by elements of three U.S. Marine battalions. The attack was repulsed by Kawaguchi&#x27;s troops under Akinosuke Oka&#x27;s local command. During the action three Marine companies were surrounded by Japanese forces near Point Cruz west of the Matanikau, took heavy losses, and only escaped due to assistance from the destroyer and landing craft crewed by U.S. Coast Guard personnel. One of those was piloted by Douglas Munro, who was killed as he maneuvered his craft to protect the escaping Marines and became the only Coast Guardsman to be awarded the Medal of Honor.

Between 6 and 9 October a larger force of Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the 2nd Infantry Division under the command of Generals Masao Maruyama and Yumio Nasu, and inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese 4th Infantry Regiment. This action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau and hindered Japanese preparations for their planned major offensive on the U.S. Lunga defenses. Between 9 and 11 October the U.S. 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines raided two small Japanese outposts about east of the Lunga perimeter at Gurabusu and Koilotumaria near Aola Bay. These raids killed 35 Japanese at a cost of 17 Marines and 3 U.S. Navy personnel killed.

===Battle of Cape Esperance===
Throughout the last week of September and the first week of October, Tokyo Express runs continually delivered troops from the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division to Guadalcanal. The Japanese Navy promised to support the IJA&#x27;s planned offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and also by stepping up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.

In the meantime, Millard F. Harmon, commander of U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific, convinced Ghormley that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive. Thus, on 8 October, the 2,837 men of the 164th Infantry Regiment from the Americal Division boarded ships at New Caledonia for the trip to Guadalcanal with a projected arrival date of 13 October. To protect the transports carrying the 164th to Guadalcanal, Ghormley ordered Task Force 64, consisting of four cruisers and five destroyers under U.S. Rear Admiral Norman Scott, to intercept and combat any Japanese ships that approached Guadalcanal and threatened the arrival of the transport convoy.

Mikawa&#x27;s 8th Fleet staff scheduled a substantial Express run for the night of 11 October. Two seaplane tenders and six destroyers were ordered to put 728 soldiers, along with artillery and ammunition, ashore on Guadalcanal. At the same time, in a separate operation, three heavy cruisers and two destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Aritomo Gotō were to bombard Henderson Field with special explosive shells with the objective of destroying the Cactus Air Force and the airfield&#x27;s facilities. Because U.S. Navy warships had not yet attempted to interdict any Tokyo Express missions to Guadalcanal, the Japanese were not expecting any opposition from Allied naval surface forces that night.

Just before midnight, Scott&#x27;s warships detected Gotō&#x27;s force on radar near the entrance to the strait between Savo Island and Guadalcanal. Scott&#x27;s force was in a position to cross the T on Gotō&#x27;s unsuspecting formation. Opening fire, Scott&#x27;s warships sank a cruiser and a destroyer, heavily damaged another cruiser, mortally wounded Gotō, and forced the rest of Gotō&#x27;s warships to abandon their bombardment mission and retreat. During the exchange of gunfire, one of Scott&#x27;s destroyers was sunk, and one cruiser and another destroyer were heavily damaged. In the meantime, the Japanese supply convoy successfully completed unloading at Guadalcanal and began its return journey without being discovered by Scott&#x27;s force.

Later on the morning of 12 October, four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to assist Gotō&#x27;s retreating, damaged warships. Air attacks by CAF aircraft from Henderson Field sank two of these destroyers later that day. Meanwhile, the convoy of U.S. Army troops reached Guadalcanal as scheduled on 13 October, successfully delivering its cargo and passengers to the island.

===Henderson Field===
====Battleship bombardment====
Despite the U.S. victory off Cape Esperance, the Japanese continued with plans and preparations for their large offensive scheduled for later in October. The Japanese decided to risk a rare departure from their usual practice of only using fast warships to deliver men and materiel to the island. On 13 October, a convoy comprising six cargo ships escorted by eight screening destroyers departed the Shortland Islands for Guadalcanal. The convoy carried 4,500 troops from the 16th and 230th Infantry Regiments, some naval marines, two batteries of heavy artillery, and one company of tanks.

To protect the approaching convoy from attack by CAF aircraft, Yamamoto sent the 3rd Battleship Division from Truk to bombard Henderson Field, under the command of Takeo Kurita. At 01:33 on 14 October, IJN battleships and , escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, reached Guadalcanal and opened fire on Henderson Field from a distance of . At this range, over ten miles (16 km), Allied shore batteries had no prospect of returning effective fire. Over the next one hour and 23 minutes, the two battleships fired 973 shells into the Lunga perimeter, most of which fell in and around the area of the airfield. Many of the shells were fragmentation shells, specifically designed to destroy land targets. The bombardment heavily damaged both runways, burned almost all of the available aviation fuel, and destroyed 48 of the CAF&#x27;s 90 aircraft. 41 men were killed, including six CAF pilots. Few CAF aircraft survived entirely unscathed, and only about a dozen remained in flyable condition the next day. Wrecked and damaged planes were lined up wingtip to wingtip, in the hopes of diverting Japanese attention from the few surviving aircraft. After exhausting their ammunition around 3 a.m., the Japanese battleship force immediately returned to Truk. Allied troops stationed at Henderson Field colloquially referred to this bombardment, the heaviest they had endured thus far in the campaign, as &quot;The Night&quot;. 

Despite the heavy damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours. Seventeen SBD-3 Dauntless dive bombers and 20 F4F Wildcats at Espiritu Santo were quickly flown to Henderson, and U.S. Army and Marine transport aircraft shuttled aviation gasoline from Espiritu Santo to Guadalcanal. Aware of the approach of the large Japanese reinforcement convoy, the U.S. desperately sought a way to interdict the convoy before it could reach Guadalcanal. Using fuel drained from destroyed aircraft and from a cache in the nearby jungle, the CAF attacked the convoy twice on 14 October but caused no damage.

The Japanese convoy reached Tassafaronga Point at midnight on 14 October and began unloading. Throughout the day of 15 October, a string of CAF aircraft from Henderson bombed and strafed the unloading convoy, destroying three of the cargo ships. The remainder of the convoy departed that night, having unloaded all of the troops and about two-thirds of the supplies and equipment. Several Japanese heavy cruisers also bombarded Henderson on the nights of 14 and 15 October, destroying a few additional CAF aircraft but failing to inflict further significant damage to the airfield.

====Battle for Henderson Field====
Between 1 and 17 October, the Japanese delivered 15,000 troops to Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Therefore, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the 38th Division), under Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defenses from the south, near the east bank of the Lunga River. The date of the attack was set for 22 October, then changed to 23 October. To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake&#x27;s heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) under Major General Tadashi Sumiyoshi were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor. The Japanese estimated that there were 10,000 American troops on the island, when in fact there were about 23,000. Despite this, American commanders were pessimistic about their ability to repulse another concerted Japanese attack on the airfield. Units were given orders to fight as guerrillas should they be overrun by the Japanese, and the 1st Marine Division&#x27;s intelligence staff began burning their classified records. Speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox refused to publicly guarantee that Guadalcanal could be held. 
On 12 October, a company of Japanese engineers began to break a trail, called the &quot;Maruyama Road&quot;, from the Matanikau towards the southern portion of the U.S. Lunga perimeter. The trail traversed some of the most difficult terrain on Guadalcanal, including numerous rivers and streams, deep, muddy ravines, steep ridges, and dense jungle. Between 16 and 18 October, the 2nd Division began their march along the Maruyama Road.

By 23 October, Maruyama&#x27;s forces were still struggling through the jungle to reach the American lines. That evening, after learning that his forces had yet to reach their attack positions, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained unaware of the approach of Maruyama&#x27;s forces.
Sumiyoshi was informed by Hyakutake&#x27;s staff of the postponement of the offensive to 24 October, but he was unable to contact his troops to inform them of the delay. Thus, at dusk on 23 October, two battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment and the nine tanks of the 1st Independent Tank Company launched attacks on the U.S. Marine defenses at the mouth of the Matanikau. U.S. Marine artillery, cannon, and small arms fire repulsed the attacks, destroying all the tanks and killing many of the Japanese soldiers while suffering only light casualties.

Finally, late on 24 October, Maruyama&#x27;s forces reached the Lunga perimeter. Over two consecutive nights Maruyama&#x27;s forces conducted numerous frontal assaults on positions defended by troops of the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines under Lieutenant Colonel Chesty Puller and the U.S. Army&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall. U.S. Marine and Army units armed with rifles, machine guns, mortars, and artillery, including direct canister fire from 37 mm anti-tank guns, &quot;wrought terrible carnage&quot; on the Japanese. A few small groups of Japanese broke through the American defenses, but were hunted down and killed over the next several days. More than 1,500 of Maruyama&#x27;s troops were killed in the attacks, while the Americans lost about 60 killed. Over the same two days American aircraft from Henderson Field defended against attacks by Japanese aircraft and warships, destroying 14 aircraft and sinking a light cruiser.

Further Japanese attacks near the Matanikau on 26 October were also repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese. As a result, by 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake called off any further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. About half of Maruyama&#x27;s survivors were ordered to retreat back to the upper Matanikau Valley while the 230th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Toshinari Shōji was told to head for Koli Point, east of the Lunga perimeter. Leading elements of the 2nd Division reached the 17th Army headquarters area at Kokumbona, west of the Matanikau on 4 November. The same day, Shōji&#x27;s unit reached Koli Point and made camp. Decimated by combat losses, malnutrition, and tropical diseases, the 2nd Division was incapable of further offensive action and fought as a defensive force along the coast for the rest of the campaign. In total, the Japanese lost 2,200–3,000 troops in the battle while the Americans lost around 80 killed.

===Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands===
At the same time that Hyakutake&#x27;s troops were attacking the Lunga perimeter, a large Japanese naval force consisting of two fleet carriers (&quot;Shokaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;), two other light carriers, four battleships and various supporting vessels moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. Under the overall command of Yamamoto, this fleet was the largest that the Japanese had assembled since the Battle of Midway. Yamamoto&#x27;s goal was to draw the bulk of Allied naval strength in the region, specifically the American aircraft carriers, into a decisive sea battle at the same time that Japanese troops on Guadalcanal were attacking the airfield in force. Allied naval carrier forces in the area, under the overall command of William Halsey Jr., also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle. Nimitz had replaced Ghormley with Admiral Halsey on 18 October after concluding that Ghormley had become too pessimistic and myopic to effectively continue leading Allied forces in the South Pacific Area. Due to faulty reports from Hyakutake that his ground forces had seized the airfield over the night of October 25, Yamamoto ordered his task force to sail south and seek out the American fleet.

The two opposing carrier forces confronted each other on the morning of 26 October, in what became known as the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, the last carrier battle of the war in the Pacific until the Battle of the Philippine Sea nearly two years later. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships were forced to retreat from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk (&quot;Hornet&quot;) and another () heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces, however, also retired because of high aircraft and aircrew losses and significant damage to two carriers. Although the Japanese had apparently secured a tactical victory in terms of ships sunk and damaged, their loss of almost 150 veteran carrier pilots provided a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low. Throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, Allied forces were far more successful in recovering downed pilots (both ground-based and carrier-based) than the Japanese. Japanese carriers would play no further significant role in the campaign.

===November land actions===
In order to exploit the victory in the Battle for Henderson Field, Vandegrift sent six Marine battalions, later joined by one Army battalion, on an offensive west of the Matanikau. The operation was commanded by Merritt Edson and its goal was to capture Kokumbona, headquarters of the 17th Army, west of Point Cruz. Defending the Point Cruz area were Japanese army troops from the 4th Infantry Regiment commanded by Nomasu Nakaguma. The 4th Infantry was severely understrength because of battle damage, tropical disease, and malnutrition. 
The American offensive began on 1 November and, after some difficulty, succeeded in destroying Japanese forces defending the Point Cruz area by 3 November, including rear echelon troops sent to reinforce Nakaguma&#x27;s battered regiment. The Americans appeared to be on the verge of breaking through the Japanese defenses and capturing Kokumbona. At this time, however, other American forces discovered and engaged newly landed Japanese troops near Koli Point on the eastern side of the Lunga perimeter. To counter this new threat, Vandegrift temporarily halted the Matanikau offensive on 4 November. The Americans suffered 71 killed and the Japanese around 400 killed in the offensive.

At Koli Point early in the morning 3 November, five Japanese destroyers delivered 300 army troops to support Shōji and his troops who were en route to Koli Point after the Battle for Henderson Field. Having learned of the planned landing, Vandegrift sent a battalion of Marines under Herman H. Hanneken to intercept the Japanese at Koli. Soon after landing, the Japanese soldiers encountered and drove Hanneken&#x27;s battalion back towards the Lunga perimeter. In response, Vandegrift ordered Puller&#x27;s Marine battalion plus two of the 164th infantry battalions, along with Hanneken&#x27;s battalion, to move towards Koli Point to attack the Japanese forces there.
As the American troops began to move, Shōji and his soldiers began to arrive at Koli Point. Beginning on 8 November, the American troops attempted to encircle Shōji&#x27;s forces at Gavaga Creek near Koli Point. Meanwhile, Hyakutake ordered Shōji to abandon his positions at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. A gap existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines. Between 9 and 11 November, Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men escaped into the jungle to the south. On 12 November, the Americans completely overran and killed all the remaining Japanese soldiers left in the pocket. The Americans counted the bodies of 450–475 Japanese dead in the Koli Point area and captured most of Shōji&#x27;s heavy weapons and provisions. The American forces suffered 40 killed and 120 wounded in the operation.

Meanwhile, on 4 November, two companies from the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson landed by boat at Aola Bay, east of Lunga Point. Carlson&#x27;s raiders, along with troops from the Army&#x27;s 147th Infantry Regiment, were to provide security for 500 Seabees as they attempted to construct an airfield at that location. Halsey, acting on a recommendation by Turner, had approved the Aola Bay airfield construction effort; however it was abandoned at the end of November because of unsuitable terrain.

On 5 November, Vandegrift ordered Carlson and his raiders to march overland from Aola and attack any of Shōji&#x27;s forces that had escaped from Koli Point. With the rest of the companies from his battalion, which arrived a few days later, Carlson and his troops set off on a 29-day patrol from Aola to the Lunga perimeter. During the patrol, the raiders fought several battles with Shōji&#x27;s retreating forces, killing almost 500 of them, while suffering 16 killed. Tropical diseases and a lack of food felled many more of Shōji&#x27;s men. By the time Shōji&#x27;s forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300 men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700 to 800 survivors were still with him. Most of the survivors from Shōji&#x27;s force joined other Japanese units defending the Mount Austen and upper Matanikau River area. 

Tokyo Express runs on 5, 7, and 9 November delivered additional troops from the Japanese 38th Infantry Division, including most of the 228th Infantry Regiment. These fresh troops were quickly placed in the Point Cruz and Matanikau area and helped successfully resist further attacks by American forces on 10 and 18 November. The Americans and Japanese remained facing each other along a line just west of Point Cruz for the next six weeks.

===Naval Battle of Guadalcanal===

After the defeat in the Battle for Henderson Field, the IJA planned to try again to retake the airfield in November 1942, but further reinforcements were needed before the operation could proceed. The IJA requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support the next offensive. Yamamoto provided 11 large transport ships to carry the remaining 7,000 troops from the 38th Infantry Division, their ammunition, food, and heavy equipment from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. He also provided a warship support force that included two battleships, and , equipped with special fragmentation shells, which were to bombard Henderson Field on the night of 12–13 November. The goal of the bombardment was to destroy the airfield and the aircraft stationed there, to allow the slow transports to reach Guadalcanal and unload safely the next day. The warship force was commanded from &quot;Hiei&quot; by recently promoted Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe.
In early November, Allied intelligence learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to retake Henderson Field. In response, on 11 November the U.S. sent Turner&#x27;s Task Force 67 to Guadalcanal, carrying Marine replacements, two U.S. Army infantry battalions, ammunition and food. The supply ships were protected by two task groups, commanded by Rear Admirals Daniel J. Callaghan and Norman Scott, as well as by aircraft from Henderson Field. The ships were attacked several times on 11 and 12 November by Japanese aircraft from Rabaul staging through an air base at Buin, Bougainville, but most unloaded their cargo without serious damage.

U.S. reconnaissance aircraft spotted the approach of Abe&#x27;s bombardment force and passed a warning to Allied commanders. Thus warned, Turner detached all usable combat ships under Callaghan to protect the troops ashore from the expected Japanese naval attack and troop landing, and ordered the supply ships at Guadalcanal to depart by early evening 12 November. Callaghan&#x27;s force comprised two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and eight destroyers.

Around 01:30 on 13 November, Callaghan&#x27;s force intercepted Abe&#x27;s bombardment group between Guadalcanal and Savo Island. In addition to the two battleships, Abe&#x27;s force included one light cruiser and 11 destroyers. In the pitch darkness the two warship forces became intermingled before opening fire at unusually close range. In the resulting mêlée, Abe&#x27;s warships sank or severely damaged all but one cruiser and one destroyer in Callaghan&#x27;s force; both Callaghan and Scott were killed. Two Japanese destroyers were sunk, and another destroyer and the battleship &quot;Hiei&quot; were heavily damaged. Despite his defeat of Callaghan&#x27;s force, Abe ordered his warships to retire without bombarding Henderson Field. The &quot;Hiei&quot; sank later that day after repeated air attacks by aircraft from Henderson Field and the carrier &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Because of Abe&#x27;s failure to neutralize Henderson Field, Yamamoto ordered Tanaka&#x27;s troop transport convoy, located near the Shortland Islands, to wait an additional day before heading towards Guadalcanal. Yamamoto ordered Nobutake Kondō to assemble another bombardment force using warships from Truk and Abe&#x27;s force to attack Henderson Field on 15 November.

In the meantime, around 02:00 on 14 November, a cruiser and destroyer force under Gunichi Mikawa from Rabaul conducted an unopposed bombardment of Henderson Field. The bombardment caused some damage, but failed to put the airfield or most of its aircraft out of operation. As Mikawa&#x27;s force retired towards Rabaul, Tanaka&#x27;s transport convoy, trusting that Henderson Field was destroyed or heavily damaged, began its run down &quot;the Slot&quot; towards Guadalcanal. Throughout the day of 14 November, aircraft from Henderson Field and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; attacked Mikawa and Tanaka&#x27;s ships, sinking one heavy cruiser and seven of the transports. Most of the troops were rescued from the transports by Tanaka&#x27;s escorting destroyers and returned to the Shortlands. After dark, Tanaka and the remaining four transports continued towards Guadalcanal as Kondō&#x27;s force approached to bombard Henderson Field.

In order to intercept Kondō&#x27;s force, Halsey, who was low on undamaged ships, detached two battleships, the and , and four destroyers from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task force. This force, under the command of Willis A. Lee aboard the &quot;Washington&quot;, reached Guadalcanal and Savo Island just before midnight on 14 November, shortly before Kondō&#x27;s bombardment force arrived. Kondō&#x27;s force consisted of the battleship &quot;Kirishima&quot;, two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and nine destroyers. After the two forces made contact, Kondō&#x27;s force quickly sank three of the U.S. destroyers and heavily damaged the fourth. The Japanese warships then sighted, opened fire, and damaged the &quot;South Dakota&quot;. As Kondō&#x27;s warships concentrated on the &quot;South Dakota&quot;, the &quot;Washington&quot; approached the Japanese ships unobserved and opened fire on the &quot;Kirishima&quot;, inflicting severe damage upon the Japanese battleship. After fruitlessly chasing the &quot;Washington&quot; towards the Russell Islands, Kondō ordered his warships to retire without bombarding Henderson Field. One of Kondō&#x27;s destroyers was also sunk during the engagement.
As Kondō&#x27;s ships retired, the four Japanese transports beached near Tassafaronga Point on Guadalcanal at 04:00. At 05:55, U.S. aircraft and artillery began attacking the beached transports, destroying all four, along with most of the supplies that they carried. Only 2,000–3,000 of the IJA troops reached the shore. Because of the failure to deliver most of the troops and supplies, the Japanese were forced to cancel their planned November offensive on Henderson Field, making the battle a significant strategic victory for the Allies and marking the beginning of the end of Japanese attempts to retake Henderson Field.

On 26 November, Japanese Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura took command of the newly formed Eighth Area Army at Rabaul. The new command encompassed both Hyakutake&#x27;s 17th Army and the 18th Army in New Guinea. One of Imamura&#x27;s first priorities upon assuming command was the continuation of the attempts to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal. The Allied offensive at Buna in New Guinea, however, changed Imamura&#x27;s priorities. Because the Allied attempt to take Buna was considered a more severe threat to Rabaul, Imamura postponed further major reinforcement efforts to Guadalcanal, in order to concentrate on the situation in New Guinea.

===Battle of Tassafaronga===
By this stage of the campaign, the Japanese were experiencing severe difficulty delivering sufficient supplies to sustain their troops on Guadalcanal. Attempts to use submarines for resupply runs in the last two weeks in November failed to provide sufficient food for Hyakutake&#x27;s forces. A separate attempt to establish bases in the central Solomon Islands, which could facilitate barge convoys to Guadalcanal, also failed because of destructive and frequent Allied air attacks. On 26 November, the 17th Army notified Imamura that it faced an acute food crisis. Some front-line units had not been resupplied for six days, and even the rear-area troops were on one-third rations. The situation forced the Japanese to return to using destroyers to deliver supplies, which were unable to handle the scale of reinforcement required by the beleaugered IJA troops on Guadalcanal.

The staff of the IJN Eighth Fleet devised a plan to help reduce the exposure of destroyers delivering supplies to Guadalcanal. Large oil or gas drums were cleaned and filled with medical supplies and food, with enough air space to provide buoyancy, and strung together with rope. When the destroyers arrived at Guadalcanal they would make a sharp turn and the drums would be cut loose, after which a swimmer or boat from shore was meant to pick up the buoyed end of a rope attached to the drums and return it to the beach, where the soldiers could haul in the supplies.

The Eighth Fleet&#x27;s Guadalcanal Reinforcement Unit (the Tokyo Express), commanded by Tanaka, was tasked by Mikawa with making the first of five scheduled runs to Tassafaronga using the drum method on the night of 30 November. Tanaka&#x27;s unit was centered on eight destroyers, with six destroyers assigned to carry between 200 and 240 drums of supplies apiece. Notified by intelligence sources of the Japanese supply attempt, Halsey ordered the newly formed Task Force 67, comprising four cruisers and four destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright, to intercept Tanaka&#x27;s force off Guadalcanal. Two additional destroyers joined Wright&#x27;s force en route to Guadalcanal from Espiritu Santo during the day of 30 November.

At 22:40 on 30 November, Tanaka&#x27;s force arrived off Guadalcanal and prepared to unload the supply barrels. Meanwhile, Wright&#x27;s warships were approaching through Ironbottom Sound from the opposite direction. Wright&#x27;s destroyers detected Tanaka&#x27;s force on radar, and the destroyer commander requested permission to attack with torpedoes. Wright waited four minutes before giving permission, allowing Tanaka&#x27;s force to escape from an optimum firing setup. All of the American torpedoes missed their targets. At the same time, Wright&#x27;s cruisers opened fire, hitting and destroying one of the Japanese guard destroyers. The rest of Tanaka&#x27;s warships abandoned the supply mission, increased speed, turned, and launched a total of 44 torpedoes in the direction of Wright&#x27;s cruisers. The Japanese torpedoes hit and sank the U.S. cruiser and heavily damaged the cruisers , , and . The rest of Tanaka&#x27;s destroyers escaped without damage but failed to deliver any of the provisions to Guadalcanal.

By 7 December 1942, Hyakutake&#x27;s forces were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. Further attempts by Tanaka&#x27;s destroyer forces to deliver provisions on 3, 7 and 11 December failed to alleviate the crisis, and one of Tanaka&#x27;s destroyers was sunk by a U.S. PT boat torpedo. Tanaka privately informed Admiral Mikawa that the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal could no longer be supplied by sea, and advised that they be withdrawn from the island. Tanaka was subsequently transferred to an administrative post in Singapore.

===Japanese decision to withdraw===
On 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. At the same time, several army staff officers at the Imperial General Headquarters (IGH) also suggested that further efforts to retake Guadalcanal would be impossible. A delegation led by Colonel Joichiro Sanada, chief of the IGH&#x27;s operations section, visited Rabaul on 19 December and consulted Imamura and his staff. Upon the delegation&#x27;s return to Tokyo, Sanada recommended that Guadalcanal be abandoned. The IGH&#x27;s top leaders agreed with Sanada&#x27;s recommendation on 26 December and ordered their staffs to begin drafting plans for a withdrawal from Guadalcanal, establishment of a new defense line in the central Solomons, and shifting priorities and resources to the campaign in New Guinea.

On 28 December, General Hajime Sugiyama and Admiral Osami Nagano personally informed Emperor Hirohito of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. On 31 December, Hirohito formally endorsed the decision. The Japanese secretly began to prepare for the evacuation, called Operation Ke, scheduled to begin during the latter part of January 1943. By now, mainly due to malnutrition and disease, Japanese forces on the island had dwindled to fewer than 15,000 men. 

===Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse===

By December, the weary 1st Marine Division was withdrawn for recuperation, and over the course of the next month the U.S. XIV Corps took over operations on the island. This corps consisted of the 2nd Marine Division and the U.S. Army&#x27;s 25th Infantry and 23rd &quot;Americal&quot; Divisions. U.S. Army Major General Alexander Patch replaced Vandegrift as commander of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which by January totaled just over 50,000 men.

On 18 December, Allied (mainly U.S. Army) forces began attacking Japanese positions on Mount Austen. A strong Japanese fortified position, called the Gifu, stymied the attacks and the Americans were forced to temporarily halt their offensive on 4 January. The Allies renewed the offensive on 10 January, attacking the Japanese on Mount Austen as well as on two nearby ridges called the Sea Horse and the Galloping Horse. After some difficulty, the Allies captured all three by 23 January. At the same time, U.S. Marines advanced along the north coast of the island, making significant gains. The Americans lost about 250 killed in the operation while the Japanese suffered around 3,000 killed, about 12 to 1 in the Americans&#x27; favor.

===&quot;Ke&quot; evacuation===
On 14 January, a Tokyo Express run delivered a battalion of troops to act as a rear guard for the &quot;Ke&quot; evacuation. A staff officer from Rabaul accompanied the troops to notify Hyakutake of the decision to withdraw. At the same time, Japanese warships and aircraft moved into position around the Rabaul and Bougainville areas in preparation to execute the withdrawal operation. Allied intelligence detected the Japanese movements but misinterpreted them as preparations for another attempt to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal.

Patch, wary of what he thought to be an imminent Japanese offensive, committed only a relatively small portion of his troops to continue a slow-moving offensive against Hyakutake&#x27;s forces. On 29 January, Halsey, acting on the same intelligence, sent a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal screened by a cruiser task force. Sighting the cruisers, Japanese naval torpedo bombers attacked that same evening and heavily damaged the cruiser . The next day, more torpedo aircraft attacked and sank &quot;Chicago&quot;. Halsey ordered the remainder of the task force to return to base and directed the rest of his naval forces to take station in the Coral Sea, south of Guadalcanal, to be ready to counter a Japanese offensive.

In the meantime, the Japanese 17th Army withdrew to the west coast of Guadalcanal while rear guard units checked the American offensive. On the night of 1 February, a force of 20 destroyers from Mikawa&#x27;s 8th Fleet under Shintarō Hashimoto successfully extracted 4,935 soldiers, mainly from the 38th Division, from the island. The Japanese and Americans each lost a destroyer from an air and naval attack related to the evacuation mission.

On the nights of 4 and 7 February, Hashimoto and his destroyers evacuated the remaining Japanese forces from Guadalcanal. Apart from some air attacks, Allied forces were still anticipating a large Japanese offensive and did not attempt to interdict Hashimoto&#x27;s evacuation runs. In total, the Japanese successfully evacuated 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. Their last troops left the island on the evening of 7 February, six months to the day from when the U.S. forces first landed. Two days later, on 9 February, Patch realized that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure.

==Aftermath==
After the Japanese withdrawal, Guadalcanal and Tulagi were developed into major bases supporting the Allied advance further up the Solomon Islands chain. Besides Henderson Field, two additional fighter runways were constructed at Lunga Point, and a bomber airfield was built at Koli Point. Extensive naval port and logistics facilities were established at Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida. The anchorage around Tulagi became an important forward base for Allied warships and transport ships supporting the Solomon Islands campaign. Major ground units were staged through large encampments and barracks on Guadalcanal before deployment further up the Solomons.

After Guadalcanal the Japanese were clearly on the defensive in the Pacific. The constant pressure to reinforce Guadalcanal had weakened Japanese efforts in other theaters, contributing to a successful Australian and American counteroffensive in New Guinea which culminated in the capture of the key bases of Buna and Gona in early 1943. The Allies had gained a strategic initiative which they never relinquished. In June, the Allies launched Operation Cartwheel which, after modification in August 1943, formalized the strategy of isolating Rabaul and cutting its sea lines of communication. The subsequent successful neutralization of Rabaul and the forces centered there facilitated the South West Pacific campaign under MacArthur and Central Pacific island-hopping campaign under Nimitz, with both efforts successfully advancing toward Japan. The remaining Japanese defenses in the South Pacific Area were then either destroyed or bypassed by Allied forces as the war progressed.

==Significance==

===Resources===


The Battle of Guadalcanal was one of the first prolonged campaigns in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. It strained logistical capabilities of the combatant nations. For the U.S., this need prompted the development of effective combat air transport for the first time. A failure to achieve air supremacy forced Japan to rely on reinforcement by barges, destroyers, and submarines, with very uneven results. Early in the campaign, the Americans were hindered by a lack of resources, as they suffered heavy losses in cruisers and carriers, with replacements from ramped-up shipbuilding programs still months away from materializing.

The U.S. Navy suffered such high personnel losses during the campaign that it refused to publicly release total casualty figures for years. However, as the campaign continued, and the American public became more and more aware of the plight and perceived heroism of the American forces on Guadalcanal, more forces were dispatched to the area. This spelled trouble for Japan as its military-industrial complex was unable to match the output of American industry and manpower. Thus, as the campaign wore on the Japanese were losing irreplaceable units while the Americans were rapidly replacing and even augmenting their forces.

The Guadalcanal campaign was costly to Japan strategically and in material losses and manpower. Roughly 30,000 personnel, including 25,000 experienced ground troops, died during the campaign. As many as three-quarters of the deaths were from non-combat causes such as starvation and various tropical diseases. The drain on resources directly contributed to Japan&#x27;s failure to achieve its objectives in the New Guinea campaign. Japan also lost control of the southern Solomons and the ability to interdict Allied shipping to Australia. Japan&#x27;s major base at Rabaul became further directly threatened by Allied air power. Most importantly, scarce Japanese land, air, and naval forces had disappeared forever into the Guadalcanal jungle and surrounding sea. The Japanese could not replace the aircraft destroyed and ships sunk in this campaign, as well as their highly trained and veteran crews, especially the naval aircrews, nearly as quickly as the Allies.

===Strategy===
While the Battle of Midway is viewed as a turning point in the Pacific War, Japan remained on the offensive, as shown by its advances down the Solomon Islands. Only after the Allied victories in Guadalcanal and New Guinea (at Milne Bay and Buna–Gona) were these large-scale Japanese offensive actions stopped. Strategic initiative passed to the Allies, as it proved, permanently. The Guadalcanal campaign ended all Japanese expansion attempts in the Pacific and placed the Allies in a position of clear supremacy. The Allied victory at Guadalcanal was the first step in a long string of successes that eventually led to the surrender and occupation of Japan.

The &quot;Europe first&quot; policy agreed to by the Allies had initially only allowed for defensive actions against Japanese expansion in order to focus resources on defeating Germany. However, Admiral King&#x27;s argument for the Guadalcanal invasion, as well as its successful implementation, convinced Roosevelt that the Pacific Theater could be pursued offensively as well. By the end of 1942, it was clear that Japan had lost the Guadalcanal campaign, a serious blow to Japan&#x27;s strategic plans for the defense of their empire and an unanticipated defeat at the hands of the Americans.

Perhaps as important as the military victory for the Allies was the psychological victory. On a level playing field, the Allies had beaten Japan&#x27;s best land, air, and naval forces. After Guadalcanal, Allied personnel regarded the Japanese military with much less fear and awe than previously. In addition, the Allies viewed the eventual outcome of the Pacific War with greatly increased optimism.

Tokyo Express no longer has terminus on Guadalcanal.
: —Major General Alexander Patch, USA, Commander, U.S. Forces on Guadalcanal

Guadalcanal is no longer merely a name of an island in Japanese military history. It is the name of the graveyard of the Japanese army.
:— Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi, IJA, Commander, 35th Infantry Brigade at Guadalcanal

Beyond Kawaguchi, several Japanese political and military leaders, including Naoki Hoshino, Nagano, and Torashirō Kawabe, stated shortly after the war that Guadalcanal was the decisive turning point in the conflict. Said Kawabe, &quot;As for the turning point [of the war], when the positive action ceased or even became negative, it was, I feel, at Guadalcanal.&quot;

==Vilu War Museum and Guadalcanal American Memorial==
The Vilu War Museum is on Guadalcanal, about west of Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands. The remains of military equipment and of several aircraft can be seen in the open-air museum. Several memorials for the American, Australian, Fijian, New Zealand and Japanese soldiers who died are erected there.
To mark the 50th anniversary of the Red Beach landings, the Guadalcanal American Memorial was dedicated in Honiara on 7 August 1992.

== Remaining ordnance ==

An unknown amount of unexploded bombs from the battle remain on the island, and residents of the island have been killed or severely injured by unexpected explosions from hidden explosives. The threat to people&#x27;s lives from unexploded bombs remain high. The Solomon Islands police force has disposed most of the discovered bombs; however, clearance work is expensive, and the island does not have sufficient resources to clear the remaining explosives. The Solomon Islands have urged both the U.S. and Japanese governments to clear the remaining bombs from the island. In 2012, 18 years after the U.S. ended its aid program in the South Pacific, the U.S. provided funds to assist efforts to find and remove unexploded bombs. Australia and Norway also established programs to help the Solomon Islands remove unexploded bombs.

==News reporting==
The Guadalcanal campaign was the subject of a large amount of high-quality reporting. News agencies sent some of their most talented writers, as it was the first major American offensive combat operation of the war. Richard Tregaskis, who wrote for International News Service, gained fame with the publication of his bestselling &quot;Guadalcanal Diary&quot; in 1943. Hanson Baldwin, a Navy correspondent, filed stories for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the early days of World War II. Tom Yarbrough wrote for the Associated Press, Bob Miller for the United Press, John Hersey for &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;, Ira Wolfert for the North American Newspaper Alliance (his series of articles about the November 1942 Naval Battle of Guadalcanal won him a Pulitzer Prize), Sergeant James Hurlbut for the Marine Corps, and Mack Morriss for &quot;Yank&quot; magazine. Commander Vandegrift placed few restrictions on the reporters who were generally allowed to go wherever they wanted and write what they wanted.
