<text>Jean-Luc Godard ( , ; ; 3 December 193013 September 2022) was a French and Swiss film director, screenwriter, and film critic. He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the French New Wave film movement of the 1960s, alongside such filmmakers as François Truffaut, Agnès Varda, Éric Rohmer and Jacques Demy. He was arguably the most influential French filmmaker of the post-war era. According to AllMovie, his work &quot;revolutionized the motion picture form&quot; through its experimentation with narrative, continuity, sound, and camerawork.

During his early career as a film critic for &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, Godard criticized mainstream French cinema&#x27;s &quot;Tradition of Quality&quot; and championed Hollywood directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. In response, he and like-minded critics began to make their own films, challenging the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema. Godard first received global acclaim for &quot;Breathless&quot; (1960), a milestone in the New Wave movement. His work makes use of frequent homages and references to film history, and often expressed his political views; he was an avid reader of existentialism and Marxist philosophy, and in 1969 formed the Dziga Vertov Group with other radical filmmakers to promote political works. After the New Wave, his politics were less radical, and his later films came to be about human conflict and artistic representation &quot;from a humanist rather than Marxist perspective.&quot; He explained that &quot;As a critic, I thought of myself as a film-maker. Today I still think of myself as a critic, and in a sense I am, more than ever before. Instead of writing criticism, I make a film, but the critical dimension is subsumed.&quot;

Godard was married three times, to actresses Anna Karina and Anne Wiazemsky, both of whom starred in several of his films, and later to his longtime partner Anne-Marie Miéville. His collaborations with Karina in &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; (1962), &quot;Bande à part&quot; (1964) and &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; (1965) were called &quot;arguably the most influential body of work in the history of cinema&quot; by &quot;Filmmaker&quot; magazine. In a 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, Godard ranked third in the critics&#x27; top ten directors of all time. He is said to have &quot;generated one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century.&quot; His work has been central to narrative theory and has &quot;challenged both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism&#x27;s vocabulary.&quot; In 2010, Godard was awarded an Academy Honorary Award. He was known for his aphorisms, such as &quot;All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun&quot; and “A film consists of a beginning, a middle and an end, though not necessarily in that order.”

== Early life ==
Jean-Luc Godard was born on 3 December 1930 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, the son of Odile (&quot;née&quot; Monod) and Paul Godard, a Swiss physician. His wealthy parents came from Protestant families of Franco–Swiss descent, and his mother was the daughter of Julien Monod, a founder of the Banque Paribas. She was the great-granddaughter of theologian Adolphe Monod. Other relatives on his mother&#x27;s side include composer Jacques-Louis Monod, naturalist Théodore Monod and pastor Frédéric Monod. On his father&#x27;s side, he is a first cousin of former Prime Minister and later President of Peru Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. Four years after Jean-Luc&#x27;s birth, his father moved the family to Switzerland. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Godard was in France, and returned to Switzerland with difficulty. He spent most of the war in Switzerland, although his family made clandestine trips to his grandfather&#x27;s estate on the French side of Lake Geneva. Godard attended school in Nyon, Switzerland.

Not a frequent film-goer, he attributed his introduction to cinema to a reading of André Malraux&#x27;s essay &quot;Outline of a Psychology of Cinema&quot; and the &quot;La Revue du cinéma&quot;, which was relaunched in 1946. In 1946, he went to study at the Lycée Buffon in Paris and, through family connections, mixed with members of its cultural elite. He lodged with the writer Jean Schlumberger. Having failed his baccalauréat exam in 1948, he returned to Switzerland. He studied in Lausanne and lived with his parents, whose marriage was breaking up. He spent time in Geneva also with a group that included another film fanatic, Roland Tolmatchoff, and the extreme rightist philosopher Jean Parvulesco. His elder sister Rachel encouraged him to paint, which he did, in an abstract style. After time spent at a boarding school in Thonon to prepare for the retest, which he passed, he returned to Paris in 1949. He registered for a certificate in anthropology at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), but did not attend class.

== Early career (1950–1959) ==
=== Film criticism ===
In Paris, in the Latin Quarter just prior to 1950, &quot;ciné-clubs&quot; (film societies) were gaining prominence. Godard began attending these clubs—the Cinémathèque Française, Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin (CCQL), Work and Culture ciné club, and others—which became his regular haunts. The Cinémathèque was founded by Henri Langlois and Georges Franju in 1936; Work and Culture was a workers&#x27; education group for which André Bazin had organized wartime film screenings and discussions and which had become a model for the film clubs that had risen throughout France after the Liberation; CCQL, founded in about 1947 or 1948, was animated and intellectually led by Maurice Schérer. At these clubs he met fellow film enthusiasts including Claude Chabrol and François Truffaut. Godard was part of a generation for whom cinema took on a special importance. He said: &quot;In the 1950s cinema was as important as bread—but it isn&#x27;t the case anymore. We thought cinema would assert itself as an instrument of knowledge, a microscope... a telescope... At the Cinémathèque I discovered a world which nobody had spoken to me about. They&#x27;d told us about Goethe, but not Dreyer. ... We watched silent films in the era of talkies. We dreamed about film. We were like Christians in the catacombs.&quot;

His foray into films began in the field of criticism. Along with Maurice Schérer (writing under the to-be-famous pseudonym Éric Rohmer) and Jacques Rivette, he founded the short-lived film journal &quot;&quot;, which saw the publication of five issues in 1950. When Bazin co-founded the influential critical magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; in 1951 (a seminal publication on cinema and its main observers and participants), Godard was the first of the younger critics from the CCQL/Cinémathèque group to be published. The January 1952 issue featured his review of an American melodrama directed by Rudolph Maté, &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot;. His &quot;Defence and Illustration of Classical Découpage&quot; published in September 1952, in which he attacks an earlier article by Bazin and defends the use of the shot–reverse shot technique, is one of his earliest important contributions to cinema criticism. Praising Otto Preminger and &quot;the greatest American artist—Howard Hawks&quot;, Godard raises their harsh melodramas above the more &quot;formalistic and overtly artful films of Welles, De Sica, and Wyler which Bazin endorsed&quot;. At this point Godard&#x27;s activities did not include making films. Rather, he watched films, and wrote about them, and helped others make films, notably Rohmer, with whom he worked on &quot;Présentation ou Charlotte et son steak&quot;.

=== Filmmaking ===
Having left Paris in the fall of 1952, Godard returned to Switzerland and went to live with his mother in Lausanne. He became friendly with his mother&#x27;s lover, Jean-Pierre Laubscher, who was a labourer on the Grande Dixence Dam. Through Laubscher he secured work himself as a construction worker at the Plaz Fleuri work site at the dam. He saw the possibility of making a documentary film about the dam; when his initial contract ended, to prolong his time at the dam, he moved to the post of telephone switchboard operator. While on duty, in April 1954, he put through a call to Laubscher which relayed the fact that Odile Monod, Godard&#x27;s mother, had died in a scooter accident. Thanks to Swiss friends who lent him a 35 mm movie camera, he was able to shoot on 35mm film. He rewrote the commentary that Laubscher had written, and gave his film a rhyming title &quot;Opération béton&quot; (&quot;Operation Concrete&quot;). The company that administered the dam bought the film and used it for publicity purposes.

As he continued to work for &quot;Cahiers&quot;, he made &quot;Une femme coquette&quot; (1955), a 10-minute short, in Geneva; and in January 1956 he returned to Paris. A plan for a feature film of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Elective Affinities&quot; proved too ambitious and came to nothing. Truffaut enlisted his help to work on an idea he had for a film based on the true-crime story of a petty criminal, Michel Portail, who had shot a motorcycle policeman and whose girlfriend had turned him in to the police, but Truffaut failed to interest any producers. Another project with Truffaut, a comedy about a country girl arriving in Paris, was also abandoned. He worked with Rohmer on a planned series of short films centering on the lives of two young women, Charlotte and Véronique; and in the autumn of 1957, Pierre Braunberger produced the first film in the series, &quot;All the Boys Are Called Patrick&quot;, directed by Godard from Rohmer&#x27;s script. &quot;A Story of Water&quot; (1958) was created largely out of unused footage shot by Truffaut. In 1958, Godard, with a cast that included Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anne Colette, made his last short before gaining international prominence as a filmmaker, &quot;Charlotte et son Jules&quot;, an homage to Jean Cocteau. The film was shot in Godard&#x27;s hotel room on the rue de Rennes and apparently reflected something of the &#x27;romantic austerity&#x27; of Godard&#x27;s own life at this time. His Swiss friend Roland Tolmatchoff noted: &quot;In Paris he had a big Bogart poster on the wall and nothing else.&quot; In December 1958, Godard reported from the Festival of Short Films in Tours and praised the work of, and became friends with Jacques Demy, Jacques Rozier and Agnès Varda—he already knew Alain Resnais whose entry he praised—but Godard now wanted to make a feature film. He travelled to the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and asked Truffaut to let him use the story on which they had collaborated in 1956, about car thief Michel Portail. He sought money from producer Georges de Beauregard, whom he had met previously while working briefly in the publicity department of Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s Paris office, and who was also at the Festival. Beauregard could offer his expertise, but was in debt from two productions based on Pierre Loti stories; hence, financing came instead from a film distributor, René Pignières.

== New Wave (1960–1967) ==
=== &quot;Breathless&quot; ===
Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; (&quot;À bout de souffle&quot;, 1960), starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, distinctly expressed the French New Wave&#x27;s style, and incorporated quotations from several elements of popular culture—specifically American film noir. It was based on a story suggested by François Truffaut. The film employed various techniques such as the innovative use of jump cuts (which were traditionally considered amateurish), character asides and breaking the eyeline match in continuity editing. Another unique aspect of &quot;Breathless&quot; was the spontaneous writing of the script on the day of shooting—a technique that the actors found unsettling—which contributed to the spontaneous, documentary-like ambiance of the film.

From the beginning of his career, Godard included more film references in his movies than any of his New Wave colleagues. In &quot;Breathless&quot;, his citations include a movie poster showing Humphrey Bogart (from his last film, &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;), whose expression Belmondo tries reverently to imitate—visual quotations from the films of Ingmar Bergman, Samuel Fuller, Fritz Lang and others; and an onscreen dedication to Monogram Pictures, an American B-movie studio. Quotations from, and references to, literature include William Faulkner, Dylan Thomas, Louis Aragon, Rainer Maria Rilke, Françoise Sagan and Maurice Sachs. The film also contains citations to composers (J. S. Bach, Mozart) and painters (Picasso, Paul Klee and Auguste Renoir).

Godard wanted to hire Seberg, who was living in Paris with her husband François Moreuil, a lawyer, to play the American woman. Seberg had become famous in 1956 when Otto Preminger had chosen her to play Joan of Arc in his &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, and had then cast her in his 1958 adaptation of &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot;. Her performance in this film had not been generally regarded as a success—&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s critic called her a &quot;misplaced amateur&quot;—but Truffaut and Godard disagreed. In the role of Michel Poiccard, Godard cast Belmondo, an actor he had already called, in &quot;Arts&quot; in 1958, &quot;the Michel Simon and the Jules Berry of tomorrow.&quot; The cameraman was Raoul Coutard, choice of the producer Beauregard. Godard wanted &quot;Breathless&quot; to be shot like a documentary, with a lightweight handheld camera and a minimum of added lighting; Coutard had experience as a documentary cameraman while working for the French army&#x27;s information service during the French-Indochina War. Tracking shots were filmed by Coutard from a wheelchair pushed by Godard. Though Godard had prepared a traditional screenplay, he dispensed with it and wrote the dialogue day by day as the production went ahead. The film&#x27;s importance was recognized immediately, and in January 1960 Godard won the Jean Vigo Prize, awarded &quot;to encourage an auteur of the future&quot;. One reviewer mentioned Alexandre Astruc&#x27;s prophecy of the age of the &quot;caméra-stylo&quot;, the camera that a new generation would use with the efficacy with which a writer uses his pen—&quot;here is in fact the first work authentically written with a &quot;caméra-stylo&quot;. Richard Brody writes: “After &quot;Breathless&quot;, anything artistic appeared possible in the cinema. The film moved at the speed of the mind and seemed, unlike anything that preceded it, a live recording of one person thinking in real time.&quot; Phillip Lopate wrote that “It seemed a new kind of storytelling, with its saucy jump cuts, digressions, quotes, in jokes and addresses to the viewer.”

=== Early work with Anna Karina ===
In 1960 Godard shot &quot;Le petit soldat&quot; (&quot;The Little Soldier&quot;). The cast included Godard&#x27;s future wife Anna Karina. At this time Karina had virtually no experience as an actress. Godard used her awkwardness as an element of her performance. Godard and Karina were a couple by the end of the shoot. She appeared again, along with Belmondo, in Godard&#x27;s first color film, &quot;A Woman Is a Woman&quot; (1961), their first project to be released. The film was intended as an homage to the American musical. Adjustments that Godard made to the original version of the story gave it autobiographical resonances, &quot;specifically in regard to his relationship with Anna Karina.&quot; The film revealed &quot;the confinement within the four walls of domestic life&quot; and &quot;the emotional and artistic fault lines that threatened their relationship&quot;.

=== &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; ===
Godard&#x27;s next film, &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; (&quot;My Life to Live&quot;, 1962), was one of his most popular among critics. Karina starred as Nana, an errant mother and aspiring actress whose financially strained circumstances lead her to the life of a streetwalker. It is an episodic account of her rationalizations to prove she is free, even though she is tethered at the end of her pimp&#x27;s short leash. In one scene, within a café, she spreads her arms out and announces she is free to raise or lower them as she wishes.

The film was a popular success and led to Columbia Pictures giving him a deal where he would be provided with $100,000 to make a movie, with complete artistic control.

=== &quot;Le petit soldat&quot; and &quot;Les Carabiniers&quot; ===
&quot;Le petit soldat&quot; was not released until 1963, the first of three films he released that year. It dealt with the Algerian War of Independence and was banned by the French government for the next two years due to its political nature. The &#x27;little soldier&#x27; Bruno Forestier was played by Michel Subor. Forestier was a character close to Godard himself, an image-maker and intellectual, &#x27;more or less my spokesman, but not totally&#x27; Godard told an interviewer.

The film begins on 13 May 1958, the date of the attempted putsch in Algeria, and ends later the same month. In the film, Bruno Forestier, a photojournalist who has links with a right-wing paramilitary group working for the French government, is ordered to murder a professor accused of aiding the Algerian resistance. He is in love with Veronica Dreyer, a young woman who has worked with the Algerian fighters. He is captured by Algerian militants and tortured. His organization captures and tortures her. In making &quot;Le petit soldat&quot;, Godard took the unusual step of writing dialogue every day and calling the lines to the actors during filming – a technique made possible by filming without direct sound and dubbing dialogue in post-production.

His following film was &quot;Les Carabiniers&quot;, based on a story by Roberto Rossellini, one of Godard&#x27;s influences. The film follows two peasants who join the army of a king, only to find futility in the whole thing as the king reveals the deception of war-administrating leaders.

=== &quot;Contempt&quot; ===
His final film of 1963, and the most commercially successful of his career, was &quot;Le Mépris&quot; (&quot;Contempt&quot;), starring Michel Piccoli and one of France&#x27;s biggest female stars, Brigitte Bardot. The film follows Paul (Piccoli), a screenwriter who is commissioned by Prokosch (Jack Palance), an arrogant American movie producer, to rewrite the script for an adaptation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, directed by Austrian director Fritz Lang (playing himself). Lang&#x27;s &#x27;high culture&#x27; interpretation of the story is lost on Prokosch, whose character is a firm indictment of the commercial motion picture hierarchy.

=== Anouchka Films ===
In 1964, Godard and Karina formed a production company, Anouchka Films. He directed &quot;Bande à part&quot; (&quot;Band of Outsiders&quot;), also starring Karina and described by Godard as &quot;&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; meets Franz Kafka.&quot; It follows two young men, looking to score on a heist, who both fall in love with Karina, and quotes from several gangster film conventions. While promoting the film, Godard wrote that according to D. W. Griffith, all one needs to make a film is &quot;a girl and a gun.&quot;

&quot;Une femme mariée&quot; (&quot;A Married Woman&quot;, 1964) followed &quot;Band of Outsiders&quot;. It was a slow, deliberate, toned-down black-and-white picture without a real story. The film was shot in four weeks and was &quot;an explicitly and stringently modernist film&quot;. It showed Godard&#x27;s &quot;engagement with the most advanced thinking of the day, as expressed in the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roland Barthes&quot; and its fragmentation and abstraction reflected also &quot;his loss of faith in the familiar Hollywood styles.&quot;

In 1965, Godard directed &quot;Alphaville&quot;, a futuristic blend of science fiction, film noir and satire. Eddie Constantine starred as Lemmy Caution, a detective who is sent into a city controlled by a giant computer named Alpha 60. His mission is to make contact with Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon), a famous scientist who has fallen mysteriously silent, and is believed to be suppressed by the computer. His next film was &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; (1965). Gilles Jacob, an author, critic and president of the Cannes Film Festival, called it both a &quot;retrospective&quot; and recapitulation. He solicited the participation of Belmondo, by then a famous actor, to guarantee the necessary amount of funding for the expensive film. Godard said the film was &quot;connected with the violence and loneliness that lie so close to happiness today. It&#x27;s very much a film about France.&quot; The film featured American director Samuel Fuller as himself.

&quot;Masculin Féminin&quot; (1966), based on two Guy de Maupassant stories, &quot;La Femme de Paul&quot; and &quot;Le Signe&quot;, was a study of contemporary French youth and their involvement with cultural politics. An intertitle refers to the characters as &quot;The children of Marx and Coca-Cola.&quot; Although Godard&#x27;s cinema is sometimes thought to depict a wholly masculine point of view, Phillip John Usher has demonstrated how the film, by the way it connects images and disparate events, seems to blur gender lines.

Godard followed with &quot;Made in U.S.A&quot; (1966), the source material for which was Richard Stark&#x27;s &quot;The Jugger&quot;. A classic New Wave crime thriller, it was inspired by American Noir films. Karina stars as the anti-hero searching for her murdered lover and the film includes a cameo by Marianne Faithfull. A year later came &quot;Two or Three Things I Know About Her&quot; (1967), in which Marina Vlady portrays a woman leading a double life as housewife and prostitute, considered to be &quot;among the greatest achievements in filmmaking.&quot;

&quot;La Chinoise&quot; (1967) saw Godard at his most politically forthright so far. The film focused on a group of students and engaged with the ideas coming out of the student activist groups in contemporary France. Released just before the May 1968 events, the film is thought by some to have foreshadowed the student rebellions that took place.

=== &quot;Week End&quot; ===
That same year, Godard made a more colourful and political film, &quot;Week End&quot;. It follows a Parisian couple as they leave on a weekend trip across the French countryside to collect an inheritance. What ensues is a confrontation with the tragic flaws of the over-consuming bourgeoisie. The film contains an eight-minute tracking shot of the couple stuck in an unremitting traffic jam as they leave the city, cited as a technique Godard used to deconstruct bourgeois trends. Startlingly, a few shots contain extra footage from, as it were, before the beginning of the take (while the actors are preparing) and after the end of the take (while the actors are coming out of character). &quot;Week End&quot; enigmatic and audacious end title sequence, which reads &quot;End of Cinema&quot;, appropriately marked an end to the narrative and cinematic period in Godard&#x27;s filmmaking career.

== Political period (1968–1979) ==
Godard was known for his &quot;highly political voice&quot;, and regularly featured political content in his films. One of his earliest features, &quot;Le petit soldat&quot;, which dealt with the Algerian War of Independence, was notable for its attempt to present the complexity of the dispute; the film was perceived as equivocating and as drawing a &quot;moral equivalence&quot; between the French forces and the National Liberation Front. Along these lines, &quot;Les Carabiniers&quot; presents a fictional war that is initially romanticized in the way its characters approach their service, but becomes a stiff anti-war metonym. In addition to the international conflicts to which Godard sought an artistic response, he was also very concerned with the social problems in France. The earliest and best example of this is Karina&#x27;s potent portrayal of a prostitute in &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot;.
In 1960s Paris, the political milieu was not overwhelmed by one specific movement. There was, however, a distinct post-war climate shaped by various international conflicts such as colonialism in North Africa and Southeast Asia. Godard&#x27;s Marxist disposition did not become abundantly explicit until &quot;La Chinoise&quot; and &quot;Week End&quot;, but is evident in several films—namely &quot;Pierrot&quot; and &quot;Une femme mariée&quot;.

Godard was accused by some of harbouring anti-Semitic views: in 2010, in the lead-up to the presentation of Godard&#x27;s honorary Oscar, a prominent article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Michael Cieply drew attention to the idea, which had been circulating through the press in previous weeks, that Godard might be an anti-Semite, and thus undeserving of the accolade. Cieply makes reference to Richard Brody&#x27;s book &quot;Everything is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard&quot;, and alluded to a previous, longer article published by the &quot;Jewish Journal&quot; as lying near the origin of the debate. The article also draws upon Brody&#x27;s book, for example in the following quotation, which Godard made on television in 1981: &quot;Moses is my principal enemy...Moses, when he received the commandments, he saw images and translated them. Then he brought the texts, he didn&#x27;t show what he had seen. That&#x27;s why the Jewish people are accursed.&quot;

Immediately after Cieply&#x27;s article was published, Brody made a clear point of criticising the &quot;extremely selective and narrow use&quot; of passages in his book, and noted that Godard&#x27;s work approached the Holocaust with &quot;the greatest moral seriousness&quot;. Indeed, his documentaries feature images from the Holocaust in a context suggesting he considers Nazism and the Holocaust as the nadir of human history. Godard&#x27;s views become more complex regarding the State of Israel. In 1970, Godard travelled to the Middle East to make a pro-Palestinian film he did not complete and whose footage eventually became part of the 1976 film &quot;Ici et ailleurs&quot;. In this film, Godard seems to view the Palestinians&#x27; cause as one of many worldwide Leftist revolutionary movements. Elsewhere, Godard explicitly identified himself as an anti-Zionist but denied the accusations of anti-Semitism.

=== Vietnam War ===
Godard produced several pieces that directly address the Vietnam War. Furthermore, there are two scenes in &quot;Pierrot le fou&quot; that tackle the issue. The first is a scene that takes place in the initial car ride between Ferdinand (Belmondo) and Marianne (Karina). Over the car radio, the two hear the message &quot;garrison massacred by the Viet Cong who lost 115 men&quot;. Marianne responds with an extended musing on the way the radio dehumanises the Northern Vietnamese combatants. The war is present throughout the film in mentions, allusions, and depictions in newsreel footage, and the film&#x27;s style was affected by Godard&#x27;s political anger at the war, upsetting his ability to draw from earlier cinematic styles.

Notably, he also participated in &quot;Loin du Vietnam&quot; (1967). An anti-war project, it consists of seven sketches directed by Godard (who used stock footage from &quot;La Chinoise&quot;), Claude Lelouch, Joris Ivens, William Klein, Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, and Agnès Varda.

=== Bertolt Brecht ===
Godard&#x27;s engagement with German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht stems primarily from his attempt to transpose Brecht&#x27;s theory of epic theatre and its prospect of alienating the viewer (&quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot;) through a radical separation of the elements of the medium (theatre in Brecht&#x27;s case, but in Godard&#x27;s, film). Brecht&#x27;s influence is keenly felt through much of Godard&#x27;s work, particularly before 1980, when Godard used cinematic expression for specific political ends.

For example, &quot;Breathless&quot; elliptical editing, which denies the viewer a fluid narrative typical of mainstream cinema, forces the viewers to take on more critical roles, connecting the pieces themselves and coming away with more investment in the work&#x27;s content. In many of his most political pieces, specifically &quot;Week-end&quot;, &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot;, and &quot;La Chinoise&quot;, characters address the audience with thoughts, feelings, and instructions.

=== Marxism ===

A Marxist reading is possible with most if not all of Godard&#x27;s early work. Godard&#x27;s direct interaction with Marxism does not become explicitly apparent, however, until &quot;Week End&quot;, where the name Karl Marx is cited in conjunction with figures such as Jesus Christ. A constant refrain throughout Godard&#x27;s cinematic period is that of the bourgeoisie&#x27;s consumerism, the commodification of daily life and activity, and man&#x27;s alienation—all central features of Marx&#x27;s critique of capitalism.

In an essay on Godard, philosopher and aesthetics scholar Jacques Rancière states, &quot;When in &quot;Pierrot le fou&quot;, 1965, a film without a clear political message, Belmondo played on the word &#x27;scandal&#x27; and the &#x27;freedom&#x27; that the Scandal girdle supposedly offered women, the context of a Marxist critique of commodification, of pop art derision at consumerism, and of a feminist denunciation of women&#x27;s false &#x27;liberation&#x27;, was enough to foster a dialectical reading of the joke and the whole story.&quot; The way Godard treated politics in his cinematic period was in the context of a joke, a piece of art, or a relationship, presented to be used as tools of reference, romanticising the Marxist rhetoric, rather than being solely tools of education.

&quot;Une femme mariée&quot; is also structured around Marx&#x27;s concept of commodity fetishism. Godard once said that it is &quot;a film in which individuals are considered as things, in which chases in a taxi alternate with ethological interviews, in which the spectacle of life is intermingled with its analysis&quot;. He was very conscious of the way he wished to portray the human being. His efforts are overtly characteristic of Marx, who in his &quot;Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844&quot; gives one of his most nuanced elaborations, analysing how the worker is alienated from his product, the object of his productive activity. Georges Sadoul, in his short rumination on the film, describes it as a &quot;sociological study of the alienation of the modern woman&quot;.

=== Revolutionary period (1968–1979) ===
The period which spans from May 1968 into the 1970s has been given various labelsfrom his &quot;militant&quot; period, to his &quot;radical&quot; period, along with terms as specific as &quot;Maoist&quot; and as vague as &quot;political&quot;. In any case, the period saw Godard employ consistent revolutionary rhetoric in his films and in his public statements.

Inspired by the May 68 upheaval, Godard, alongside François Truffaut, led protests that shut down the 1968 Cannes Film Festival in solidarity with the students and workers. Godard stated there was not a single film showing at the festival that represented their causes. &quot;Not one, whether by Milos, myself, Roman or François. There are none. We&#x27;re behind the times.&quot;

=== Films ===
Amid the upheavals of the late 1960s, Godard became passionate about &quot;making political films politically.&quot; Though many of his films from 1968 to 1972 are feature-length films, they are low-budget and challenge the notion of what a film can be. In addition to abandoning mainstream filmmaking, Godard also tried to escape the cult of personality that had formed around him. He worked anonymously in collaboration with other filmmakers, most notably Jean-Pierre Gorin, with whom he formed the Dziga-Vertov cinema collective. During this period Godard made films in England, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Palestine, and the U.S., as well as France. He and Gorin toured with their work, attempting to create discussion, mainly on college campuses. This period came to a climax with the big-budget production &quot;Tout Va Bien&quot;, which starred Yves Montand and Jane Fonda. Owing to a motorcycle accident that severely incapacitated Godard, Gorin ended up directing this most celebrated of their work together almost single-handedly. As a companion piece to &quot;Tout va bien&quot;, the pair made &quot;Letter to Jane&quot;, a 50-minute &quot;examination of a still&quot; showing Jane Fonda visiting with the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. The film is a deconstruction of Western imperialist ideology. This was the last film that Godard and Gorin made together.

In 1978 Godard was commissioned by the Mozambican government to make a short film. During this time his experience with Kodak film led him to criticise the film stock as &quot;inherently racist&quot; since it did not reflect the variety, nuance or complexity in dark brown or dark skin. This was because Kodak Shirley cards were only made for Caucasian subjects, a problem that was not rectified until 1995.

=== Sonimage ===
In 1972, Godard and his life partner, Swiss filmmaker, Anne-Marie Miéville started the alternative video production and distribution company Sonimage, based in Grenoble. Under Sonimage, Godard produced &quot;Comment ca va&quot;, &quot;Numéro Deux&quot; (1975) and &quot;Sauve qui peut (la vie)&quot; (1980). In 1976, Godard and Miéville, his future wife, collaborated on a series of innovative video works for European broadcast television, titled &quot;Six fois deux/Sur et sous la communication&quot; (1976) and &quot;France/tour/détour/deux/enfants&quot; (1978). From the time that Godard returned to mainstream filmmaking in 1980, Anne-Marie Miéville remained an important collaborator.

=== Jean-Pierre Gorin ===
After the events of May 1968, when the city of Paris saw a total upheaval in response to the &quot;authoritarian de Gaulle&quot;, and Godard&#x27;s professional objective was reconsidered, he began to collaborate with like-minded individuals in the filmmaking arena. His most notable collaborator was Jean-Pierre Gorin, a Maoist student of Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan, who later became a professor of Film Studies at the University of California at San Diego, with a passion for cinema that attracted Godard&#x27;s attention.

Between 1968 and 1973, Godard and Gorin collaborated to make a total of five films with strong Maoist messages. The most prominent film from the collaboration was &quot;Tout Va Bien&quot; (1972). The film starred Jane Fonda, who was, at the time, the wife of French filmmaker Roger Vadim. Fonda was at the height of her acting career, having won an Academy Award for her performance in &quot;Klute&quot; (1971), and had gained notoriety as a left-wing anti-war activist. The male lead was the legendary French singer and actor Yves Montand, who had appeared in prestigious films by Georges Clouzot, Alain Résnais, Sacha Guitry, Vincente Minelli, George Cukor, and Costa-Gavras.

=== Dziga Vertov Group ===

The small group of Maoists that Godard had brought together, which included Gorin, adopted the name Dziga Vertov Group. Godard had a specific interest in Dziga Vertov, a Soviet filmmakerwho was known for a series of radical documentaries titled &quot;Kino Pravda&quot; (literally, &quot;film truth&quot;) and the late silent-era feature film &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; (1929). Vertov was also a contemporary of both Soviet montage theorists, notably Sergei Eisenstein, and Russian constructivist and avant-garde artists such as Alexander Rodchenko and Vladimir Tatlin. Part of Godard&#x27;s political shift after May 1968 was toward a proactive participation in the class struggle and he drew inspiration from filmmakers associated with the Russian Revolution.

Towards the end of this period of his life, Godard began to feel disappointed with his Maoist ideals and was abandoned by his wife at the time, Anne Wiazemsky. In this context, according to biographer Antoine de Baecque, Godard attempted suicide on two occasions.

== Return to commercial films and &quot;Histoire(s) du cinéma&quot; (1980–2000) ==
Godard returned to somewhat more traditional fiction with &quot;Sauve qui peut (la vie)&quot; (1980), the first of a series of more mainstream films marked by autobiographical currents: it was followed by &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Lettre à Freddy Buache&quot; (both 1982), &quot;Prénom Carmen&quot; (1983), and &quot;Grandeur et décadence d&#x27;un petit commerce de cinéma&quot; (1986). There was, though, another flurry of controversy with &quot;Je vous salue, Marie&quot; (1985), which was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church for alleged heresy, and also with &quot;King Lear&quot; (1987), a postmodern production of the play by William Shakespeare. Also completed in 1987 was a segment in the film &quot;Aria&quot; which was based loosely from the plot of Armide; it is set in a gym and uses several arias by Jean-Baptiste Lully from his famous &quot;Armide&quot;.

His later films were marked by great formal beauty and frequently a sense of requiem: &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; (&quot;New Wave&quot;, 1990), the autobiographical &quot;JLG/JLG, autoportrait de décembre&quot; (&quot;JLG/JLG: Self-Portrait in December&quot;, 1995), and &quot;For Ever Mozart&quot; (1996). &quot;Allemagne année 90 neuf zéro&quot; (&quot;Germany Year 90 Nine Zero&quot;, 1991) which is a quasi-sequel to &quot;Alphaville&quot;, but done with an elegiac tone and focus on the inevitable decay of age. In 1990, Godard was presented with a special award from the National Society of Film Critics. Between 1988 and 1998, he produced the multi-part series &quot;Histoire(s) du cinéma&quot;, a monumental project which combined all the innovations of his video work with a passionate engagement in the issues of twentieth-century history and the history of film itself.

== Late period films (2001–2022) ==
In 2001, &quot;Éloge de l&#x27;amour&quot; (&quot;In Praise of Love&quot;) was released. The film is notable for its use of both film and video—the first half captured in 35 mm black and white, the latter half shot in color on DV—and subsequently transferred to film for editing. The film is also noted for containing themes of ageing, love, separation, and rediscovery as it follows the young artist Edgar in his contemplation of a new work on the four stages of love. In &quot;Notre musique&quot; (2004), Godard turned his focus to war, specifically, the war in Sarajevo, but with attention to all war, including the American Civil War, the war between the U.S. and Native Americans, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The film is structured into three Dantean kingdoms: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. Godard&#x27;s fascination with paradox is constant in the film. It opens with a long, ponderous montage of war images that occasionally lapses into the comic; Paradise is shown as a lush wooded beach patrolled by U.S. Marines.

Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Film Socialisme&quot; (2010) premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. It was released theatrically in France in May 2010. Godard was rumoured to be considering directing a film adaptation of Daniel Mendelsohn&#x27;s &quot;The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million&quot;, an award-winning book about the Holocaust. In 2013, Godard released the short &quot;Les trois désastres&quot; (&quot;The Three Disasters&quot;) as part of the omnibus film &quot;3X3D&quot; with filmmakers Peter Greenaway and Edgar Pera. &quot;3X3D&quot; premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. His 2014 film &quot;Goodbye to Language&quot;, shot in 3-D, revolves around a couple who cannot communicate with each other until their pet dog acts as an interpreter for them. The film makes reference to a wide range of influences such as paintings by Nicolas de Staël and the writing of William Faulkner, as well as the work of mathematician Laurent Schwartz and dramatist Bertolt Brecht—one of Godard&#x27;s most important influences. It was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize. Godard&#x27;s non-traditional script for the film was described as a collage of handwritten text and images, and an &quot;artwork&quot; itself.

In 2015 J. Hoberman reported that Godard was working on a new film. Initially titled &quot;Tentative de bleu&quot;, in December 2016 Wild Bunch co-chief Vincent Maraval stated that Godard had been shooting &quot;Le livre d&#x27;image&quot; (&quot;The Image Book&quot;) for almost two years &quot;in various Arab countries, including Tunisia&quot; and that it is an examination of the modern Arab World. &quot;Le livre d&#x27;image&quot; was first shown in November 2018. On 4 December 2019, an art installation piece created by Godard opened at the Fondazione Prada in Milan. Titled &quot;Le Studio d&#x27;Orphée&quot;, the installation is a recreated workspace and includes editing equipment, furniture, and other materials used by Godard in post-production.

In 2020, Godard told &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; that his new film would be about a Yellow vest protestor, and indicated that along with archival footage &quot;there will also be a shoot. I don&#x27;t know if I will find what are called actors...I would like to film the people we see on news channels but by plunging them into a situation where documentary and fiction come together.&quot; In March 2021 he said that he was working on two new films during a virtual interview at the International Film Festival of Kerala. Godard stated &quot;I&#x27;m finishing my movie life yes, my moviemaker life by doing two scripts...After, I will say, &#x27;Goodbye, cinema.

In July 2021, cinematographer and long time collaborator Fabrice Aragno said that work on the films was going slowly and Godard was more focused on &quot;books, on the ideas of the film, and less in the making.&quot; Godard suggested making a film like Chris Marker&#x27;s &quot;La Jetée&quot; to &quot;come back to his origin.&quot; Much of the film would be shot on 35mm, 16mm and 8mm film, but the expense of celluloid film stock and the COVID-19 pandemic stalled production. Aragno expected to shoot test footage that fall. He added that the second film was for the Arte channel in France. The first of the two films, a 20-minute short titled &quot;Trailer of the Film That Will Never Exist: &quot;Phony Wars&quot;&quot;, premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, in collaboration with St. Laurent. The second and final posthumous short, &quot;Scenarios&quot;, left unfinished at the time of Godard&#x27;s death, was finished by Aragno and Jean-Paul Battagia and will have its world premiere at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.

Aragno said that he did not think that either film would be Godard&#x27;s last film, adding &quot;I say this often that &quot;Éloge de l&#x27;amour&quot; was the beginning of his last gesture. These five, or six or seven films are connected to each other in a way, they&#x27;re not just full stops. It&#x27;s not just one painting.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
Godard was married to two of his leading women: Anna Karina (1961–1965) and Anne Wiazemsky (1967–1979). Beginning in 1970, he collaborated personally and professionally with Anne-Marie Miéville. Godard lived with Miéville in Rolle, Switzerland, from 1978 onwards, and was described by his former wife Karina as a &quot;recluse&quot;. Godard married Miéville in the 2010s, according to Patrick Jeanneret, an adviser to Godard.

His relationship with Karina in particular produced some of his most critically acclaimed films, and their relationship was widely publicised: &quot;The Independent&quot; described them as &quot;one of the most celebrated pairings of the 1960s&quot;. &quot;Filmmaker&quot; magazine called their collaborations &quot;arguably the most influential body of work in the history of cinema.&quot; 

According to Karina, their relationship was tumultuous and Godard was abusive to her. Later in life, Karina said they no longer spoke to each other.

Through his father, he was the cousin of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, former President of Peru.

In 2017, Michel Hazanavicius directed a film about Godard, &quot;Redoubtable&quot;, based on the memoir &quot;One Year After&quot; (; 2015) by Wiazemsky. It centers on his life in the late 1960s, when he and Wiazemsky made films together. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017. Godard said that the film was a &quot;stupid, stupid idea&quot;.

Agnes Varda&#x27;s 2017 documentary &quot;Faces Places&quot; culminates with Varda and co-director JR knocking on Godard&#x27;s front door in Rolle for an interview. Godard agreed to the meeting but he &quot;stands them up&quot;. His nephew and assistant directed the 2018 documentary &quot;Film Catastrophe&quot;, which included behind-the-scenes footage, shot on the &quot;Costa Concordia&quot; cruise ship by Grivas during the making of &quot;Film Socialism&quot;, of Godard working with actors and directing the film. Godard participated in the 2022 documentary &quot;&quot;. Director Mitra Farahani initiated an email exchange between Godard and Iranian filmmaker Ebrahim Golestan, with emailed text letters from Golestan and &quot;videos, images, and aphorism&quot; responses from Godard.

At the age of 91, Godard died on 13 September 2022, at his home in Rolle. His death was reported as an assisted suicide procedure, which is legal in Switzerland. Godard&#x27;s legal advisor said that he had &quot;multiple disabling pathologies&quot;, but a family member said that &quot;He was not sick, he was simply exhausted&quot;. Miéville was by his side when he died. His body was cremated and there was no funeral service.

== Legacy ==

Godard has been recognised as one of the most influential filmmakers of the 20th century and one of the leaders of the French New Wave.

In 1969, film critic Roger Ebert wrote about Godard&#x27;s importance in cinema:

In 2001, Ebert recalled his early days as a critic, writing &quot;As much as we talked about Tarantino after &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, we talked about Godard in those days.&quot; Tarantino named his production company A Band Apart, a reference to Godard&#x27;s 1964 film. Tarantino says that &quot;To me Godard did to movies what Bob Dylan did to music. They both revolutionized their forms.&quot;

Godard&#x27;s works and innovations were praised by notable directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni and Satyajit Ray. Fritz Lang agreed to take part in Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Le Mépris&quot; due to his admiration of Godard as a director. Akira Kurosawa listed &quot;Breathless&quot; as one of his 100 favourite films. Ingmar Bergman strongly disliked Godard, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve never gotten anything out of his movies. They have felt constructed, faux intellectual and completely dead. Cinematographically uninteresting and infinitely boring. He&#x27;s made his films for the critics. One of the movies, &quot;Masculin Féminin&quot; (1966), was shot here in Sweden. It was mind-numbingly boring.&quot; Orson Welles admired Godard as a director but criticized him as a thinker, telling Peter Bogdanovich: &quot;He is the definitive &quot;influence&quot; if not really the first great film artist of this last decade, and his gifts as a director are enormous. I just can&#x27;t take him very seriously as a &quot;thinker&quot;—and that&#x27;s where we seem to differ, because &quot;he&quot; does.&quot; 

David Thomson reached a similar conclusion, writing that &quot;Godard&#x27;s greatness rests in his grasping of the idea that films are made of moving images, of moments from films, of images projected in front of audiences&quot; but that &quot;He knows only cinema: on politics and real life he is childish and pretentious.&quot; Still, Thomson calls Godard&#x27;s early films &quot;a magnificent critical explanation of American movies&quot; and &quot;one of the inescapable bodies of work&quot; and deserving of retrospectives. Thomson included &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; on his &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; list. Political activist, critic and filmmaker Tariq Ali listed Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Tout Va Bien&quot; as one of his ten favorite films of all time in the 2012 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll. American film critic Armond White listed Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; as one of his top ten favorite films in the same poll. Susan Sontag called &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; &quot;one of the most extraordinary, beautiful and original works of art I know of.&quot; Four of Godard&#x27;s films are included on the 2022 edition of the &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; list of 100 Greatest Films: &quot;Breathless&quot; (38), &quot;Le Mépris&quot; (54), &quot;Histoire(s) du cinéma&quot; (78) and &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; (85).

The 60th New York Film Festival paid tribute to Godard, who died earlier that year. &quot;The Onion&quot; paid homage to him with the headline &quot;Jean-Luc Godard Dies At End of Life In Uncharacteristically Linear Narrative Choice.&quot;

== Collaboration with ECM Records ==
Godard had a lasting friendship with Manfred Eicher, founder and head of the German music label ECM Records. The label released the soundtracks of Godard&#x27;s &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; (ECM NewSeries 1600–01) and &quot;Histoire(s) du cinéma&quot; (ECM NewSeries 1706). This collaboration expanded over the years, leading to Godard&#x27;s granting ECM permission to use stills from his films for album covers, while Eicher took over the musical direction of Godard films such as &quot;Allemagne 90 neuf zéro&quot;, &quot;Hélas Pour Moi&quot;, &quot;JLG&quot;, and &quot;For Ever Mozart&quot;. Tracks from ECM records have been used in his films; for example, the soundtrack for &quot;In Praise of Love&quot; uses Ketil Bjørnstad and David Darling&#x27;s album &quot;Epigraphs&quot; extensively. Godard also released on the label a collection of shorts he made with Anne-Marie Miéville called &quot;Four Short Films&quot; (ECM 5001).

Among the ECM album covers with Godard&#x27;s film stills are these:
* &quot;Voci&quot;, works of Luciano Berio played by Kim Kashkashian (ECM 1735)
* &quot;Words of The Angel&quot;, by Trio Mediaeval (ECM 1753)
* &quot;Morimur&quot;, by Christoph Poppen &amp; The Hilliard Ensemble (ECM 1765)
* &quot;Songs of Debussy and Mozart&quot;, by Juliane Banse &amp; András Schiff (ECM 1772)
* &quot;Requiem for Larissa&quot;, by Valentin Silvestrov (ECM 1778)
* &quot;Soul of Things&quot;, by Tomasz Stanko Quartet (ECM 1788)
* &quot;Suspended Night&quot;, by Tomasz Stanko Quartet (ECM 1868)
* &quot;Asturiana: Songs from Spain and Argentina&quot;, by Kim Kashkashian &amp; Robert Levin (ECM 1975)
* &quot;Distances&quot;, by Norma Winstone, Glauco Venier &amp; Klaus Gesing (ECM 2028)
* &quot;Live at Birdland&quot;, by Lee Konitz, Brad Mehldau, Charlie Haden &amp; Paul Motian (ECM 2162)

<text>Calamine is a historic name for an ore of zinc. The name &quot;calamine&quot; was derived from &quot;lapis calaminaris&quot;, a Latin correption of Greek &quot;cadmia (καδμία)&quot;, the old name for zinc ores in general. The name of the Belgian town of Kelmis, &quot;La Calamine&quot; in French, which was home to a zinc mine, comes from this. In the 18th and 19th centuries large ore mines could be found near the German village of Breinigerberg.

During the early 19th century it was discovered that what had been thought to be one ore was actually two distinct minerals:

* Zinc carbonate ZnCO3 or smithsonite and
* Zinc silicate Zn4Si2O7(OH)2·H2O or hemimorphite.

Although chemically and crystallographically quite distinct, the two minerals exhibit similar massive or botryoidal external form and are not readily distinguished without detailed chemical or physical analysis. The first person to separate the minerals was the British chemist and mineralogist James Smithson in 1803. In the mining industry the term calamine has been historically used to refer to both minerals indiscriminately.

In mineralogy calamine is no longer considered a valid term. It has been replaced by smithsonite and hemimorphite in order to distinguish it from the pinkish mixture of zinc oxide (ZnO) and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) known as calamine lotion.

==Early history==
In the 16th century demand for latten (brass) in England came from the needs of wool-carding, for which brass-wire combs were preferred, and battery pieces (brassware formed by hammering sheet brass in a battery mill). The only known method for producing the alloy was by heating copper and calamine together in the cementation process and in 1568 a royal charter was granted to the Society of the Mineral and Battery Works to search for the mineral and produce brass, to reduce dependence on imported metal from Germany. Factories to exploit the process were established at Isleworth and Rotherhithe. By the late 17th century enough was known of metallic zinc to make brass solder directly by combining copper and spelter (zinc ingots). In 1738 a patent was granted to William Champion, a Bristol brass founder, for the large-scale reduction of calamine to produce spelter. There were many Calamine mines in Shipham, not far from William Champion&#x27;s Brass works.

In 1684 a paper presented to the Royal Society described the medicinal and veterinary properties of the compound when in finely powdered form. Since then no mechanism of action for the powder has been identified, and the only medical effect of the powdered mineral appears to be its ability to absorb moisture secreted from irritated and weeping skin.

<text>8-bit clean is an attribute of computer systems, communication channels, and other devices and software, that process 8-bit character encodings without treating any byte as an in-band control code.

== History ==
Until the early 1990s, many programs and data transmission channels were character-oriented and treated some characters, e.g., ETX, as control characters. Others assumed a stream of seven-bit characters, with values between 0 and 127; for example, the ASCII standard used only seven bits per character, avoiding an 8-bit representation in order to save on data transmission costs. On computers and data links using 8-bit bytes, this left the top bit of each byte free for use as a parity, flag bit, or metadata control bit. 7-bit systems and data links are unable to directly handle more complex character codes which are commonplace in non-English-speaking countries with larger alphabets.

Binary files of octets cannot be transmitted through 7-bit data channels directly. To work around this, binary-to-text encodings have been devised which use only 7-bit ASCII characters. Some of these encodings are uuencoding, Ascii85, SREC, BinHex, kermit and MIME&#x27;s Base64. EBCDIC-based systems cannot handle all characters used in UUencoded data. However, the base64 encoding does not have this problem.

==SMTP and NNTP 8-bit cleanness==
Historically, various media were used to transfer messages, some of them only supporting 7-bit data, so an 8-bit message had high chances to be garbled during transmission in the 20th century. But some implementations really did not care about formal discouraging of 8-bit data and allowed high bit set bytes to pass through. Such implementations are said to be 8-bit clean. In general, a communications protocol is said to be 8-bit clean if it correctly passes through the high bit of each byte in the communication process.

Many early communications protocol standards, such as (for SMTP), (for NNTP) and , were designed to work over such &quot;7-bit&quot; communication links. They specifically require the use of ASCII character set &quot;transmitted as an 8-bit byte with the high-order bit cleared to zero&quot; and some of these explicitly restrict &quot;all&quot; data to 7-bit characters.

For the first few decades of email networks (1971 to the early 1990s), most email messages were plain text in the 7-bit US-ASCII character set.

The definition of SMTP, like its predecessor , limits Internet Mail to lines (1000 characters or less) of 7-bit US-ASCII characters.

Later, the format of email messages was redefined in order to support messages that are not entirely US-ASCII text (text messages in character sets other than US-ASCII, and non-text messages, such as audio and images). The header field Content-Transfer-Encoding=binary requires an 8-bit clean transport.

 specifies that &quot;NNTP operates over any reliable bi-directional 8-bit-wide data stream channel&quot;, and changes the character set for commands to UTF-8. However, still limits the character set to ASCII, including and MIME encoding of non-ASCII data.

The Internet community generally adds features by &quot;extension&quot;, allowing communication in both directions between upgraded machines and not-yet-upgraded machines, rather than declaring formerly standards-compliant legacy software to be &quot;broken&quot; and insisting that all software worldwide be upgraded to the latest standard. The recommended way to take advantage of 8-bit-clean links between machines is to use the ESMTP () 8BITMIME extension for message bodies and the SMTP SMTPUTF8 extension for message headers. Despite this, some mail transfer agents, notably Exim and qmail, relay mail to servers that do not advertise 8BITMIME without performing the conversion to 7-bit MIME (typically quoted-printable, &quot;Q-P conversion&quot;) required by . This &quot;just-send-8&quot; attitude does not, in fact, cause problems in practice because virtually all modern email servers are 8-bit clean.

<text>9PAC is a common abbreviation for 709 PACkage. It was a report generator developed in 1959 for the IBM 709 and used on its successor, the IBM 7090. It was developed by SHARE, an early IBM users&#x27; group, and based on the File Maintenance and Report Generator System developed by General Electric for the IBM 702, led by Harry Tellier.
Charles Bachman worked on its design in 1957, and although his company&#x27;s order for the 709 was cancelled, he later included some of its general concepts into the more generalized idea of navigational databases.
Engineers at companies such as Union Carbide, Northwest Power Company, Philips Petroleum, Dow Chemical, and Chrysler cooperated on the project.

<text>Aioli, allioli, or aïoli ( or ; Provençal or &quot;aiòli&quot; ; ; ) is a cold sauce consisting of an emulsion of garlic and olive oil; it is found in the cuisines of the northwest Mediterranean. 

The names mean &quot;garlic and oil&quot; in Catalan and Provençal. It is found in the cuisines of the Mediterranean coasts of Spain (Catalonia, the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands, Murcia, and eastern Andalusia) and France (Provence, Languedoc, Roussilon). 

Some versions of the sauce are closer to a garlic mayonnaise, incorporating egg yolks and lemon juice, whereas other versions lack egg yolk and contain more garlic. The latter gives the sauce a pastier texture, making it more laborious to produce as the emulsion is harder to stabilise. There are many variations, such as adding lemon juice or other seasonings. In France, it may include mustard. 

In Malta, the term arjoli or ajjoli is used for a different preparation made with galletti (a type of cracker), tomato, onion, garlic, and herbs.

Like mayonnaise, aioli is an emulsion or suspension of small globules of oil and oil-soluble compounds in water and water-soluble compounds. Traditionally, aioli should not include egg, but nowadays, egg or egg yolk is the usual emulsifier.

Since about 1990, it has become common in the United States to call all flavored mayonnaises &quot;aioli&quot;. Purists insist that flavored mayonnaise can contain garlic, but true aioli contains garlic and no other seasoning (except salt).

==Etymology==
In the form &quot;aioli&quot;, the word is a compound of Provençal &quot;ai&quot;, meaning &quot;garlic&quot;, and &quot;oli&quot;, meaning &quot;oil&quot;. 

The English spelling comes from the French &quot;aïoli&quot;, which is an adaptation of an Occitan term. The spelling in Occitan may be &quot;alhòli&quot;, following the classical norm, or &quot;aiòli&quot;, following the Mistralian norm. In Catalan it is spelled &quot;allioli&quot; (). The most common term in Spanish is &quot;alioli&quot;, an adaptation from Catalan, although it is also called &quot;ajoaceite&quot;, &quot;ajiaceite&quot;, &quot;ajolio&quot; or &quot;ajaceite&quot;. It is also spelled &quot;alioli&quot; in Galician.

==Basic recipe==

Garlic is crushed in a mortar and pestle and emulsified with salt and olive oil.

Today, aioli is often made in a food processor or blender, but some traditionalists object that this does not give the same result.

==Serving==

In Occitan cuisine, &quot;aioli&quot; is typically served with seafood, fish soup, and croutons. An example is a dish called &quot;merluça amb alhòli&quot;. In the Occitan Alps it is served with potatoes boiled with salt and bay laurel.

In Provençal cuisine, &quot;aioli&quot; or, more formally, &quot;le grand aïoli&quot;, &quot;aioli garni&quot;, or &quot;aïoli monstre&quot; is a dish consisting of various boiled vegetables (usually carrots, potatoes, artichokes, and green beans), poached fish (normally soaked salt cod), snails, canned tuna, other seafood, and boiled eggs, all served with &quot;aioli&quot;. This dish is often served during the festivities on the feast days of the patron saint of Provençal villages and towns. It is traditional to serve it with snails for Christmas Eve and with cod on Ash Wednesday. Aïoli is so strongly associated with Provence that when the poet Frédéric Mistral started a regionalist Provençal-language newspaper in 1891, he called it &quot;L&#x27;Aiòli&quot;.

The Provençal cuisine fish soup bourride is generally served with &quot;aioli&quot;.
In Spain, particularly in Catalan cuisine and Valencian cuisine, &quot;allioli&quot; is often served with arròs negre, arròs a banda, fideuà, with grilled snails (&quot;cargols a la llauna&quot;), grilled meat, lamb, rabbit, vegetables, boiled cod (&quot;bacallà a la catalana, bacallà amb patates&quot;) and comes in other varieties such as &quot;allioli de codony&quot; (allioli with boiled quince, not the preserve) or allioli with boiled pear. Other commonly used vegetables are beets, fennel, celery, zucchini, cauliflower, chickpeas, and raw tomato.

<text>The A-0 system (&quot;Arithmetic Language version 0&quot;) was an early compiler related tool developed for electronic computers, written by Grace Murray Hopper in 1951 and 1952 originally for the UNIVAC I. The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.

The A-0 system was followed by the A-1, A-2, A-3 (released as ARITH-MATIC), AT-3 (released as MATH-MATIC), and B-0 (released as FLOW-MATIC).

The A-2 system was developed at the UNIVAC division of Remington Rand in 1953 and released to customers by the end of that year. Customers were provided the source code for A-2 and invited to send their improvements back to UNIVAC. Thus, A-2 could be considered an example of the result of an early philosophy similar to free and open-source software.

<doc id="60392" wikidata="Q7522091" url="?curid=60392" title="Sind Province (1936–1955)">
<text>Sind (sometimes called Scinde, ) was a province of British India from 1 April 1936 to 1947 and Dominion of Pakistan from 14 August 1947 to 14 October 1955. Under the British, it encompassed the current territorial limits excluding the princely state of Khairpur. Its capital was Karachi. After Pakistan&#x27;s creation, the province lost the city of Karachi, as it became the capital of the newly created country. It became part of West Pakistan upon the creation of the One Unit Scheme.

==Administrative divisions==
On 1 April 1936 Sind division was separated from Bombay Presidency and established as a province.

At that time the Province&#x27;s Administration division are listed below: 
== Geography ==

The province was bordered by Karachi (within the Federal Capital Territory after 1948) and the princely states of Las Bela and Kalat on the west. To the north were the provinces of Baluchistan and West Punjab. The province bordered the princely state of Bahawalpur on the northeast and it enclosed on three sides the princely state of Khairpur. The Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat were beyond its borders to the east and south. On the southwest lay the Arabian Sea, with the Sind&#x27;s coastline consisting entirely of river deltas, including the Indus River Delta up to Sind&#x27;s border with the city of Karachi, now the capital of present-day Sindh.

== History ==
Sindh was first settled by the Indus Valley Civilization and Mohenjo-Daro, as early as 1750 BC. It had Greek influence during its history after the expansion of the Macedonian Empire, and developed trade with surrounding regions. Several Sunni Muslim and Rajput kingdoms were set up there, beginning with the Rai dynasty and ending with the Arghuns. The Mughal Empire conquered Sindh under the rule of Akbar in the year 1591. Soon after the coming of European companies, in particular the East India Company, the Mughal hold on the area loosened, and in 1843 Sindh became part of the British India and its Bombay Presidency on 1 October 1848. Later it became Sindh province on 1 April 1935 under All India Act of 1935. Sind Province.

=== 1936–1947 ===
On 1 April 1936, Sind was separated from Bombay Presidency to get the status of a province and the provincial capital was settled in Karachi. Hyderabad division was formed on the place of Sind division.

=== 1947–1955 ===
Following a resolution in the Sindh Legislative Assembly about joining Pakistan, with the independence and Partition of India in August 1947 Sindh became part of Pakistan.

In 1948, Karachi city (2,103 km2 area) separated from Sind to form the Federal Capital Territory of Pakistan. Apart from the city, the remaining areas of Karachi district remained part of Sind and a new district of Thatta was formed from these areas.

On 11 December 1954, the Sindh Legislative Assembly voted by 100 to 4 in favour of the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Chaudhry Mohammad Ali, and Sindh was merged into the new province of West Pakistan on 14 October 1955.

== Government ==

The offices of Governor of Sindh and Premier (later Chief Minister) of Sindh were established in 1936 when Sindh became a province. This system continued until 1955 when Sindh was dissolved.


===Elections===
* 1937
* 1946

== Demographics ==
By the time of independence in 1947 Sindh had a Muslim majority for centuries but there were significant minorities of Hindus throughout the province. In 1947 due to communal tensions and partition two million Muslim muhajir migrated to Pakistan while most Sindhi Hindus fled to India.

The Muslims from India were mostly Urdu speaking.

<text>The Association of American Publishers (AAP) is the national trade association of the American book publishing industry. AAP lobbies for book, journal and education publishers in the United States. AAP members include most of the major commercial publishers in the United States, as well as smaller and nonprofit publishers, university presses, and scholarly societies.

Patricia Schroeder, a former United States representative, served as the association&#x27;s CEO from 1997 until 2009, taking over the role from Nicholas A. Veliotes. On May 1, 2009, another former United States representative, Tom Allen, took over as president and CEO. In January 2017, Maria Pallante, a former United States Register of Copyrights, became the president and CEO of the organization.

== Activities ==
The association&#x27;s core programs deal primarily with advocacy related to: intellectual property; new technology and digital issues of concern to publishers; the freedom to read, censorship and libel; the freedom to publish; funding for education and libraries; postal rates and regulations; tax and trade policy; and international copyright enforcement.

AAP tracks publisher revenue on a monthly and annual basis with its StatShot programs. The association has also awarded books, journals, and electronic content through its annual PROSE Awards since 1976.

In August 2019, AAP sued Audible for its Captions feature, through which machine-generated text could be displayed alongside audio narration. The lawsuit was settled in February 2020, with Audible agreeing not to implement the Captions feature without obtaining express permission.

== Controversies ==
The AAP initially supported the arrest of Dmitry Sklyarov.

AAP was criticized after it contracted Eric Dezenhall&#x27;s crisis management firm to promote its position regarding the open access movement. Schroeder told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; “the association hired Dezenhall when members realized they needed help. ‘We thought we were angels for a long time and we didn&#x27;t need PR firms.’”

In 2020, AAP released press statements to support four of its members in the case of &quot;Hachette v. Internet Archive&quot; (IA). President Maria Pallante said of the case, &quot;As the complaint outlines, by illegally copying and distributing online a stunning number of literary works each day, IA displays an abandon shared only by the world’s most egregious pirate sites.&quot; This action was opposed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Public Knowledge, and the Association of Research Libraries.

<text>In computing, AAP DTD (variously known as AAP Electronic Manuscript Standard, AAP standard, AAP/EPSIG standard, and ANSI/NISO Z39.59) is a set of three SGML Document Type Definitions (book, journal, and article) for scientific documents, defined by the Association of American Publishers. It was ratified as a U.S. standard under the name ANSI/NISO Z39.59 in 1988, and evolved into the international ISO 12083 standard in 1993. It was supplanted as a U.S. standard by ANSI/ISO 12083 in 1995.

== Development and standard ratifications ==
From 1983 to 1987, the Association of American Publishers (AAP), a coalition of book and journal publishers in North America, sponsored the Electronic Manuscript Project, the earliest effort to develop a commercial SGML application. The project sought to create an SGML standard for book, journal, and article creation. With the technical work led by Aspen Systems, over thirty information-processing organizations contributed to the project, including the US Library of Congress, the American Society of Indexers, the IEEE, the American Chemical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Mathematical Society.

Two preliminary works with restricted distribution were produced in 1985, the draft AAP DTD and author guidelines.

The Electronic Publishing Special Interest Group (EPSIG) was founded to take over responsibility for the work from AAP. The consortium, sponsored by the Online Computer Library Center, recommended that the DTDs developed by the Electronic Manuscript Project should become an American standard. With the support of the AAP and the Graphic Communications Association, the AAP DTDs were ratified in 1988 as the American National Standards Institute&#x27;s &quot;Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup&quot; (ANSI/NISO Z39.59) standard. Unlike the DTDs that ANSI/NISO Z39.59 specifies for books, serials and articles, the markup recommended for mathematics and tables is not part of the standard. As the standard is based on ASCII character encoding, it includes a large set of entity definitions for special characters.

The AAP and EPSIG continued their collaboration and published a revised version of the specification in 1989.

The AAP and the European Physical Society further collaborated on a standard method for marking up mathematical notation and tables in scientific documents. Building on this work, Eric van Herwijnen, then head of the text processing section at CERN, edited the specification for adoption by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 12083, which was first published in 1993, revised in 1994 and last reconfirmed in 2016. ISO 12083 specifies four DTDs: Article, Book, Serial, and Math.

In 1995 ANSI/NISO Z39.59:1988 was superseded by ISO 12083, which was adopted as U.S. standard ANSI/NISO/ISO 12083-1995 (R2009) Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup. This U.S. standard was withdrawn in 2016.

==Usage==
The AAP DTDs counted the academic publishing house Elsevier among their earliest users and found significant acceptance in the emerging CD-ROM publishing industry.

AAP DTD also informed other SGML applications, such as CERN&#x27;s SGMLguid, the Elsevier Science Article DTD, and EWS MAJOUR, a DTD developed between 1989 and 1991 in an effort led by the publishing houses Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, and Springer.

<text>HCL Notes (formerly Lotus Notes then IBM Notes) is a proprietary collaborative software platform for Unix (AIX), IBM i, Windows, Linux, and macOS, sold by HCLTech. The client application is called Notes while the server component is branded HCL Domino.

HCL Notes provides business collaboration functions, such as email, calendars, to-do lists, contact management, discussion forums, file sharing, websites, instant messaging, blogs, document libraries, user directories, and custom applications. It can also be used with other HCL Domino applications and databases. IBM Notes 9 Social Edition removed integration with the office software package IBM Lotus Symphony, which had been integrated with the Lotus Notes client in versions 8.x.

Lotus Development Corporation originally developed &quot;Lotus Notes&quot; in 1989. IBM bought Lotus in 1995 and it became known as the Lotus Development division of IBM. On December 6, 2018, IBM announced that it was selling a number of software products to HCLSoftware for $1.8bn, including Notes and Domino. This acquisition was completed in July 2019.

==Design==
HCL Domino is a client-server cross-platform application runtime environment.

Domino provides email, calendars, instant messaging (with additional HCLSoftware voice- and video-conferencing and web-collaboration), discussions/forums, blogs, and an inbuilt personnel/user directory. In addition to these standard applications, an organization may use the Domino Designer development environment and other tools to develop additional integrated applications such as request approval / workflow and document management.

The Domino product consists of several components:

* HCL Notes client application (since version 8, this is based on Eclipse)
* HCL Notes client, either:
** a rich client
** a web client, HCL iNotes
** a mobile email client, HCL Notes Traveler 
* HCL Verse client, either: 
** a web email client, Verse on Premises (VOP)
** a mobile email client, Verse Mobile (for iOS and Android)
* HCL Domino server 
* HCL Domino Administration Client
* HCL Domino Designer (Eclipse-based integrated development environment) for creating client-server applications that run within the Notes framework

Domino competes with products from other companies such as Microsoft, Google, Zimbra and others. Because of the application development abilities, HCL Domino is often compared to products like Microsoft Sharepoint. The database in Domino can be replicated between servers and between server and client, thereby allowing clients offline capabilities.

Domino, a business application as well as a messaging server, is compatible with both Notes and web-browsers. Notes (and since IBM Domino 9, the HCAA) may be used to access any Domino application, such as discussion forums, document libraries, and numerous other applications. Notes resembles a web-browser in that it may run any compatible application that the user has permission for.

Domino provides applications that can be used to:
* access, store and present information through a user interface
* enforce security
* replicate, that is, allow many different servers to contain the same information and have many users work with that data

The standard storage mechanism in Domino is a document-database format, the &quot;Notes Storage Facility&quot; (.nsf). The .nsf file will normally contain both an application design and its associated data. Domino can also access relational databases, either through an additional server called HCL Enterprise Integrator for Domino, through ODBC calls or through the use of XPages.

As Domino is an application runtime environment, email and calendars operate as applications within Notes, which HCL provides with the product. A Domino application-developer can change or completely replace that application. HCL has released the base templates as open source as well.

Programmers can develop applications for Domino in a variety of development languages including:
* the Java programming language either directly or through XPages
* LotusScript, a language resembling Visual Basic
* the JavaScript programming language via the Domino AppDev Pack

The client supports a formula language as well as JavaScript. Software developers can build applications to run either within the Notes application runtime environment or through a web server for use in a web browser, although the interface would need to be developed separately unless XPages is used.

==Use==
Notes can be used for email, as a calendar, PIM, instant messaging, Web browsing, and other applications. Notes can access both local- and server-based applications and data.

Notes can function as an IMAP and POP email client with non-Domino mail servers. The system can retrieve recipient addresses from any LDAP server, including Active Directory, and includes a web browser, although it can be configured by a Domino Developer to launch a different web browser instead.

Features include group calendars and schedules, SMTP/MIME-based email, NNTP-based news support, and automatic HTML conversion of all documents by the Domino HTTP task.

Notes can be used with Sametime instant-messaging to allow to see other users online and chat with one or more of them at the same time. Beginning with Release 6.5, this function has been freely available. Presence awareness is available in email and other HCL Domino applications for users in organizations that use both Notes and Sametime.

Since version 7, Notes has provided a Web services interface. Domino can be a Web server for HTML files; authentication of access to Domino databases or HTML files uses the Domino user directory and external systems such as Microsoft Active Directory.

A design client, Domino Designer, can allow the development of database applications consisting of forms (which allow users to create documents) and views (which display selected document fields in columns).

In addition to its role as a groupware system (email, calendaring, shared documents and discussions), HCL Notes and Domino can also construct &quot;workflow&quot;-type applications, particularly those which require approval processes and routing of data.

Since Release 5, server clustering has had the ability to provide geographic redundancy for servers.

Notes System Diagnostic (NSD) gathers information about the running of a Notes workstation or of a Domino server.

On October 10, 2018, IBM released IBM Domino v10.0 and IBM Notes 10.0 as the latest release. In December, 2019, HCL released HCL Domino v11 and HCL Notes v11.

==Overview==

===Client/server===
Notes and Domino are client/server database environments. The server software is called Domino and the client software is Notes. Domino software can run on Windows, Unix, AIX, and IBM mid-range systems and can scale to tens of thousands of users per server. There are different supported versions of the Domino server that are supported on the various levels of server operating systems. Usually the latest server operating system is only officially supported by a version of HCL Domino that is released at about the same time as that OS.

Domino has security capabilities on a variety of levels. The authorizations can be granular, down to the field level in specific records all the way up to 10 different parameters that can be set up at a database level, with intermediate options in between. Users can also assign access for other users to their personal calendar and email on a more generic reader, editor, edit with delete and manage my calendar levels. All of the security in Notes and Domino is independent of the server OS or Active Directory. Optionally, the Notes client can be configured to have the user use their Active Directory identity.

===Data replication===
The first release of Lotus Notes included a generalized replication facility. The generalized nature of this feature set it apart from predecessors like Usenet and continued to differentiate Lotus Notes.

Domino servers and Notes clients identify NSF files by their Replica IDs, and keep replicated files synchronized by bi-directionally exchanging data, metadata, and application logic and design. There are options available to define what meta-data replicates, or specifically exclude certain meta data from replicating. Replication between two servers, or between a client and a server, can occur over a network or a point-to-point modem connection. Replication between servers may occur at intervals according to a defined schedule, in near-real-time when triggered by data changes in server clusters, or when triggered by an administrator or program.

Creation of a local replica of an NSF file on the hard disk of an HCL Notes client enables the user to fully use Notes and Domino databases while working off-line. The client synchronizes any changes when client and server next connect. Local replicas are also sometimes maintained for use while connected to the network in order to reduce network latency. Replication between a Notes client and Domino server can run automatically according to a schedule, or manually in response to a user or programmatic request. Since Notes 6, local replicas maintain all security features programmed into the applications. Earlier releases of Notes did not always do so. Early releases also did not offer a way to encrypt NSF files, raising concerns that local replicas might expose too much confidential data on laptops or insecure home office computers, but more recent releases offer encryption, and as of the default setting for newly created local replicas.

===Security===
Lotus Notes was the first widely adopted software product to use public key cryptography for client–server and server–server authentication and for encryption of data. Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000, IBM and Lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits. In 1997, Lotus negotiated an agreement with the NSA that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits, but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a &quot;workload reduction factor&quot; for the NSA. This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private-sector industrial espionage, but not against spying by the US government. This implementation was widely announced, but with some justification many people did consider it to be a backdoor. Some governments objected to being put at a disadvantage to the NSA, and as a result Lotus continued to support the 40-bit version for export to those countries.

Notes and Domino also uses a code-signature framework that controls the security context, runtime, and rights of custom code developed and introduced into the environment. Notes 5 introduced an execution control list (ECL) at the client level. The ECL allows or denies the execution of custom code based on the signature attached to it, preventing code from untrusted (and possibly malignant) sources from running. Notes and Domino 6 allowed client ECLs to be managed centrally by server administrators through the implementation of policies. Since release 4.5, the code signatures listed in properly configured ECLs prevent code from being executed by external sources, to avoid virus propagation through Notes/Domino environments. Administrators can centrally control whether each mailbox user can add exceptions to, and thus override, the ECL.

===Database security===
Access control lists (ACLs) control a user of server&#x27;s level of access to that database. Only a user with Manager access can create or modify the ACL. Default entries in the ACL can be set when the Manager creates the database.

Roles, rather than user id, can determine access level.

===Programming===
Notes and Domino is a cross-platform, distributed document-oriented NoSQL database and messaging framework and rapid application development environment that includes pre-built applications like email, calendar, etc. This sets it apart from its major commercial competitors, such as Microsoft Exchange or Novell GroupWise, which are purpose-built applications for mail and calendaring that offer APIs for extensibility.

Domino databases are built using the Domino Designer client, available only for Microsoft Windows; standard user clients are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. A key feature of Notes is that many replicas of the same database can exist at the same time on different servers and clients, across dissimilar platforms; the same storage architecture is used for both client and server replicas. Originally, replication in Notes happened at document (i.e., record) level. With release of Notes 4 in 1996, replication was changed so that it now occurs at field level.

A database is a Notes Storage Facility (.nsf) file, containing basic units of storage known as a &quot;note&quot;. Every note has a UniqueID that is shared by all its replicas. Every replica also has a UniqueID that uniquely identifies it within any cluster of servers, a domain of servers, or even across domains belonging to many organizations that are all hosting replicas of the same database. Each note also stores its creation and modification dates, and one or more Items.

There are several classes of notes, including design notes and document notes. Design notes are created and modified with the Domino Designer client, and represent programmable elements, such as the GUI layout of forms for displaying and editing data, or formulas and scripts for manipulating data. Document notes represent user data, and are created and modified with the Notes client, via a web browser, via mail routing and delivery, or via programmed code.

Document notes can have parent-child relationships, but Notes should not be considered a hierarchical database in the classic sense of information management systems. Notes databases are also not relational, although there is a SQL driver that can be used with Notes, and it does have some features that can be used to develop applications that mimic relational features. Notes does not support atomic transactions, and its file locking is rudimentary. Notes is a document-oriented database (document-based, schema-less, loosely structured) with support for rich content and powerful indexing facilities. This structure closely mimics paper-based work flows that Notes is typically used to automate.

Items represent the content of a note. Every item has a name, a type, and may have some flags set. A note can have more than one item with the same name. Item types include Number, Number List, Text, Text List, Date-Time, Date-Time List, and Rich Text. Flags are used for managing attributes associated with the item, such as read or write security. Items in design notes represent the programmed elements of a database. For example, the layout of an entry form is stored in the rich text Body item within a form design note. This means that the design of the database can replicate to users&#x27; desktops just like the data itself, making it extremely easy to deploy updated applications.

Items in document notes represent user-entered or computed data. An item named &quot;Form&quot; in a document note can be used to bind a document to a form design note, which directs the Notes client to merge the content of the document note items with the GUI information and code represented in the given form design note for display and editing purposes. However, other methods can be used to override this binding of a document to a form note. The resulting loose binding of documents to design information is one of the cornerstones of the power of Notes. Traditional database developers used to working with rigidly enforced schemas, on the other hand, may consider the power of this feature to be a double-edged sword.

Notes application development uses several programming languages. Formula and LotusScript are the two original ones. LotusScript is similar to, and may even be considered a specialized implementation of, Visual Basic, but with the addition of many native classes that model the Notes environment, whereas Formula is similar to Lotus 1-2-3 formula language but is unique to Notes.

Java was integrated into IBM Notes beginning with Release 4.5. With Release 5, Java support was greatly enhanced and expanded, and JavaScript was added. While LotusScript remains a primary tool in developing applications for the Lotus Notes client, Java and JavaScript are the primary tools for server-based processing, developing applications for browser access, and allowing browsers to emulate the functionality of the IBM Notes client. With XPages, the IBM Notes client can now natively process Java and JavaScript code, although applications development usually requires at least some code specific to only IBM Notes or only a browser.

As of version 6, Lotus established an XML programming interface in addition to the options already available. The Domino XML Language (DXL) provides XML representations of all data and design resources in the Notes model, allowing any XML processing tool to create and modify IBM Notes and Domino data.

Since Release 8.5, XPages were also integrated into IBM Notes.

External to the Notes application, HCL provides toolkits in C, C++, and Java to connect to the Domino database and perform a wide variety of tasks. The C toolkit is the most mature, and the C++ toolkit is an objectized version of the C toolkit, lacking many functions the C toolkit provides. The Java toolkit is the least mature of the three and can be used for basic application needs.

===Database===
IBM Notes includes a database management system but Notes files are different from relational or object databases because they are document-centric. Document-oriented databases such as Notes allow multiple values in items (fields), do not require a schema, come with built-in document-level access control, and store rich text data. IBM Domino 7 to 8.5.x supports the use of IBM Db2 database as an alternative store for IBM Notes databases. This NSFDB2 feature, however, is now in maintenance mode with no further development planned. An IBM Notes database can be mapped to a relational database using tools like DECS, [LEI], JDBCSql for Domino or NotesSQL.

===Configuration===
The HCL Domino server or the Domino client store their configuration in their own databases / application files (*.nsf). No relevant configuration settings are saved in the Windows Registry if the operating system is Windows. Some other configuration options (primary the start configuration) is stored in the notes.ini (there are currently over 2000 known options available).

==Use as an email client==
Notes is commonly deployed as an end-user email client in larger organizations.

When an organization employs an HCL Domino server, it usually also deploys the supplied Notes client for accessing the Notes application for email and calendaring but also to use document management and workflow applications. As Notes is a runtime environment, and the email and calendaring functions in Notes are simply an application provided by HCL, the administrators are free to develop alternate email and calendaring applications. It is also possible to alter, amend or extend the HCL supplied email and calendaring application.

The Domino server also supports POP3 and IMAP mail clients, and through an extension product (HCL mail support for Microsoft Outlook) supports native access for Microsoft Outlook clients.

HCL also provides iNotes (in Notes 6.5 renamed to &quot;Domino Web Access&quot; but in version 8.0 reverted to iNotes), to allow the use of email and calendaring features through web browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux, such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. There are several spam filtering programs available (including IBM Lotus Protector), and a rules engine allowing user-defined mail processing to be performed by the server.

===Comparison with other email clients===
Notes was designed as a collaborative application platform where email was just one of numerous applications that ran in the Notes client software. The Notes client was also designed to run on multiple platforms including Windows, OS/2, classic Mac OS, SCO Open Desktop UNIX, and Linux. These two factors have resulted in the user interface containing some differences from applications that only run on Windows. Furthermore, these differences have often remained in the product to retain backward compatibility with earlier releases, instead of conforming to updated Windows UI standards. The following are some of these differences.
* Properties dialog boxes for formatting text, hyperlinks and other rich-text information can remain open after a user makes changes to selected text. This provides flexibility to select new text and apply other formatting without closing the dialog box, selecting new text and opening a new format dialog box. Almost all other Windows applications require the user to close the dialog box, select new text, then open a new dialog box for formatting/changes.
* Properties dialog boxes also automatically recognize the type of text selected and display appropriate selections (for instance, a hyperlink properties box).
* Users can format tables as tabbed interfaces as part of form design (for applications) or within mail messages (or in rich-text fields in applications). This provides users the ability to provide tab-style organization to documents, similar to popular tab navigation in most web portals, etc.
* End-users can readily insert links to Notes applications, Notes views or other Notes documents into Notes documents.
* Deleting a document (or email) will delete it from every folder in which it appears, since the folders simply contain links to the same back-end document. Some other email clients only delete the email from the current folder; if the email appears in other folders it is left alone, requiring the user to hunt through multiple folders in order to completely delete a message. In Notes, clicking on &quot;Remove from Folder&quot; will remove the document only from that folder leaving all other instances intact.
* The &quot;All Documents&quot; and &quot;Sent&quot; &quot;views&quot; differ from other collections of documents known as &quot;folders&quot; and exhibit different behaviors. Specifically, mail cannot be dragged out of them, and so removed from those views; the email can only be &quot;copied&quot; from them. This is because these are &quot;views&quot;, and their membership indexes are maintained according to characteristics of the documents contained in them, rather than based on user interaction as is the case for a &quot;folder&quot;. This technical difference can be baffling to users, in environments where no training is given. &quot;All Documents&quot; contain all of the documents in a mailbox, no matter which folder it is in. The only way to remove something from &quot;All Documents&quot; is to delete it outright.

Lotus Notes 7 and older versions had more differences, which were removed from subsequent releases:
* Users select a &quot;New Memo&quot; to send an email, rather than &quot;New Mail&quot; or &quot;New Message&quot;. (Notes 8 calls the command &quot;New Message&quot;)
* To select multiple documents in a Notes view, one drags one&#x27;s mouse next to the documents to select, rather than using +single click. (Notes 8 uses keypress conventions.)
* The searching function offers a &quot;phrase search&quot;, rather than the more common &quot;or search&quot;, and Notes requires users to spell out Boolean conditions in search-strings. As a result, users must search for &quot;delete AND folder&quot; in order to find help text that contains the phrase &quot;delete a folder&quot;. Searching for &quot;delete folder&quot; does not yield the desired result. (Notes 8 uses or-search conventions.)

Lotus Notes 8.0 (released in 2007) became the first version to employ a dedicated user-experience team, resulting in changes in the IBM Notes client experience in the primary and new notes user interface. This new interface runs in the open source Eclipse Framework, which is a project started by IBM, opening up more application development opportunities through the use of Eclipse plug-ins. The new interface provides many new user interface features and the ability to include user-selected applications/applets in small panes in the interface. Lotus Notes 8.0 also included a new email interface / design to match the new Lotus Notes 8.0 eclipse based interface. Eclipse is a Java framework and allows IBM to port Notes to other platforms rapidly. An issue with Eclipse and therefore Notes 8.0 is the applications start-up and user-interaction speed. Lotus Notes 8.5 sped up the application and the increase in general specification of PCs means this is less of an issue.

IBM Notes 9 continued the evolution of the user interface to more closely align with modern application interfaces found in many commercial packaged or web-based software. Currently, the software still does not have an auto-correct option - or even ability - to reverse accidental use of caps lock.

Domino is now running on the Eclipse platform and offers many new development environments and tools such as XPages.

For lower spec PCs, a new version of the old interface is still provided albeit as it is the old interface many of the new features are not available and the email user interface reverts to the Notes 7.x style.

This new user experience builds on Notes 6.5 (released in 2003), which upgraded the email client, previously regarded by many as the product&#x27;s Achilles heel. Features added at that time included:
* drag and drop of folders
* replication of unread marks between servers
* follow-up flags
* reply and forward indicators on emails
* ability to edit an attachment and save the changes back to an email id

==Reception==
Publications such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2006 have criticized earlier versions of Lotus Notes for having an &quot;unintuitive [user] interface&quot; and cite widespread dissatisfaction with the usability of the client software. &quot;The Guardian&quot; indicated that Notes has not necessarily suffered as a result of this dissatisfaction due to the fact that &quot;the people who choose [enterprise software] tend not to be the ones who use it.&quot;

Earlier versions of Notes have also been criticized for violating an important usability best practice that suggests a consistent UI is often better than custom alternative. Software written for a particular operating system should follow that particular OS&#x27;s user interface style guide. Not following those style guides can confuse users. A notable example is F5 keyboard shortcut, which is used to refresh window contents in Microsoft Windows. Pressing F5 in Lotus Notes before release 8.0 caused it to lock screen. Since this was a major point of criticism this was changed in release 8.0. Old versions did not support proportional scrollbars (which give the user an idea of how long the document is, relative to the portion being viewed). Proportional scroll bars were only introduced in Notes 8.

Older versions of Notes also suffered from similar user interaction choices, many of which were also corrected in subsequent releases. One example that was corrected in Release 8.5: In earlier versions the out-of-office agent needed to be manually enabled when leaving and disabled when coming back, even if start and end date have been set. As of Release 8.5 the out-of-office notification now automatically shuts off without a need for a manual disable.

Unlike some other e-mail client software programs, IBM Notes developers made a choice to not allow individual users to determine whether a return receipt is sent when they open an e-mail; rather, that option is configured at the server level. IBM developers believe &quot;Allowing individual cancellation of return receipt violates the intent of a return receipt function within an organization&quot;. So, depending on system settings, users will have no choice in return receipts going back to spammers or other senders of unwanted e-mail. This has led tech sites to publish ways to get around this feature of Notes. For IBM Notes 9.0 and IBM iNotes 9.0, the IBM Domino server&#x27;s .INI file can now contain an entry to control return receipt in a manner that&#x27;s more aligned with community expectations (IBM Notes 9 Product Documentation).

When Notes crashes, some processes may continue running and prevent the application from being restarted until they are killed.

==Related software==
===Related IBM Lotus products===
Over the 30-year history of IBM Notes, Lotus Development Corporation and later IBM have developed many other software products that are based on, or integrated with IBM Notes. The most prominent of these is the IBM Lotus Domino server software, which was originally known as the Lotus Notes Server and gained a separate name with the release of version 4.5. The server platform also became the foundation for products such as IBM Lotus Quickr for Domino, for document management, and IBM Sametime for instant messaging, audio and video communication, and web conferencing, and with Release 8.5, IBM Connections.

In early releases of IBM Notes, there was considerable emphasis on client-side integration with the IBM Lotus SmartSuite environment. With Microsoft&#x27;s increasing predominance in office productivity software, the desktop integration focus switched for a time to Microsoft Office. With the release of version 8.0 in 2007, based on the Eclipse framework, IBM again added integration with its own office-productivity suite, the OpenOffice.org-derived IBM Lotus Symphony. IBM Lotus Expeditor is a framework for developing Eclipse-based applications.

Other IBM products and technologies have also been built to integrate with IBM Notes. For mobile-device synchronization, this previously included the client-side IBM Lotus Easysync Pro product (no longer in development) and IBM Notes Traveler, a newer no-charge server-side add-on for mail, calendar and contact sync. A recent addition to IBM&#x27;s portfolio are two IBM Lotus Protector products for mail security and encryption, which have been built to integrate with IBM Notes.

===Related software from other vendors===
With a long market history and large installed base, Notes and Domino have spawned a large third-party software ecosystem. Such products can be divided into four broad, and somewhat overlapping classes:

* Notes and Domino applications are software programs written in the form of one or more Notes databases, and often supplied as NTF templates. This type of software typically is focused on providing business benefit from Notes&#x27; core collaboration, workflow and messaging capabilities. Examples include customer relationship management (CRM), human resources, and project tracking systems. Some applications of this sort may offer a browser interface in addition to Notes client access. The code within these programs typically uses the same languages available to an in-house Domino developer: Notes formula language, LotusScript, Java and JavaScript.
* Notes and Domino add-ons, tools and extensions are generally executable programs written in C, C++ or another compiled language that are designed specifically to integrate with Notes and Domino. This class of software may include both client- and server-side executable components. In some cases, Notes databases may be used for configuration and reporting. Since the advent of the Eclipse-based Notes 8 Standard client, client-side add-ons may also include Eclipse plug-ins and XML-based widgets. The typical role for this type of software is to support or extend core Notes functionality. Examples include spam and anti-virus products, server administration and monitoring tools, messaging and storage management products, policy-based tools, data synchronization tools and developer tools.
* Notes and Domino-aware adds-ins and agents are also executable programs, but they are designed to extend the reach of a general networked software product to Notes and Domino data. This class includes server and client backup software, anti-spam and anti-virus products, and e-discovery and archiving systems. It also includes add-ins to integrate Notes with third-party offerings such as Cisco WebEx conferencing service or the Salesforce.com CRM platform.

==History==
Notes has a history spanning more than 30 years. Its chief inspiration was &quot;PLATO Notes&quot;, created by David R. Woolley at the University of Illinois in 1973. In today&#x27;s terminology, PLATO Notes supported user-created discussion groups, and it was part of the foundation for an online community which thrived for more than 20 years on the PLATO system. Ray Ozzie worked with PLATO while attending the University of Illinois in the 1970s. When PC network technology began to emerge, Ozzie made a deal with Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corporation, that resulted in the formation of Iris Associates in 1984 to develop products that would combine the capabilities of PCs with the collaborative tools pioneered in PLATO. The agreement put control of product development under Ozzie and Iris, and sales and marketing under Lotus. In 1994, after the release and marketplace success of Notes R3, Lotus purchased Iris. In 1995 IBM purchased Lotus.

In 2008, IBM released XPages technology, based on JavaServer Faces. This allows Domino applications to be better surfaced to browser clients, though the UX and business logic must be completely rewritten. Previously, Domino applications could be accessed through browsers, but required extensive web specific modifications to get full functionality in browsers. XPages also gave the application new capabilities that are not possible with the classic Notes client. The IBM Domino 9 Social Edition included the Notes Browser Plugin, which would surface Notes applications through a minified version of the rich desktop client contained in a browser tab.

===Branding===
Prior to release 4.5, the &quot;Lotus Notes&quot; branding encompassed both the client and server applications. In 1996, Lotus released an HTTP server add-on for the Notes 4 server called &quot;Domino&quot;. This add-on allowed Notes documents to be rendered as web pages in real time. Later that year, the Domino web server was integrated into release 4.5 of the core Notes server and the entire server program was re-branded, taking on the name &quot;Domino&quot;. Only the client program officially retained the &quot;Lotus Notes&quot; name.

In November 2012, IBM announced it would be dropping the Lotus brand and moving forward with the IBM brand only to identify products, including Notes and Domino. On October 9, 2018, IBM announced the availability of the latest version of the client and server software.

In 2019, Domino and Notes became enterprise software products managed under HCLSoftware.

==Release history==

===21st century===
IBM donated parts of the IBM Notes and Domino code to OpenOffice.org on September 12, 2007 and since 2008 has been regularly donating code to OpenNTF.org.

Despite repeated predictions of the decline or impending demise of IBM Notes and Domino, such as &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1998 &quot;The decline and fall of Lotus&quot;, the installed base of Lotus Notes has increased from an estimated 42 million seats in September 1998 to approximately 140 million cumulative licenses sold through 2008. Once IBM Workplace was discontinued in 2006, speculation about dropping Notes was rendered moot. Moreover, IBM introduced &quot;iNotes&quot; for iPhone two years later.

IBM contributed some of the code it had developed for the integration of the OpenOffice.org suite into Notes 8 to the project. IBM also packaged its version of OpenOffice.org for free distribution as IBM Lotus Symphony.

IBM Notes and Domino 9 Social Edition shipped on March 21, 2013. Changes include significantly updated user interface, near-parity of IBM Notes and IBM iNotes functionality, the IBM Notes Browser Plugin, new XPages controls added to IBM Domino, refreshed IBM Domino Designer user interface, added support for To Dos on Android mobile devices, and additional server functionality as detailed in the Announcement Letter.

In late 2016, IBM announced that there would not be a Notes 9.0.2 release, but 9.0.1 would be supported until at least 2021. In the same presentation IBM also stated that their internal users had been migrated away from Notes and onto the IBM Verse client.

On October 25, 2017, IBM announced a plan to deliver a Domino V10 family update sometime in 2018. The new version will be built in partnership with HCLTech. IBM&#x27;s development and support team responsible for these products are moving to HCL, however, the marketing, and sales continue to be IBM-led. Product strategy is shared between IBM and HCL. As part of the announcement, IBM indicated that there is no formal end to product support planned.

On October 9, 2018, IBM announced IBM Domino 10.0 and IBM Notes 10.0 in Frankfurt, Germany, and made them available to download on October 10, 2018.

<text>Steller&#x27;s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) is an extinct sirenian described by Georg Wilhelm Steller in 1741. At that time, it was found only around the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia; its range extended across the North Pacific during the Pleistocene epoch, and likely contracted to such an extreme degree due to the glacial cycle. It is possible indigenous populations interacted with the animal before Europeans. Steller first encountered it on Vitus Bering&#x27;s Great Northern Expedition when the crew became shipwrecked on Bering Island. Much of what is known about its behavior comes from Steller&#x27;s observations on the island, documented in his posthumous publication &quot;On the Beasts of the Sea&quot;. Within 27 years of its discovery by Europeans, the slow-moving and easily-caught mammal was hunted into extinction for its meat, fat, and hide.

Some 18th-century adults would have reached weights of and lengths up to . It was a member of the family Dugongidae, of which the long dugong (&quot;Dugong dugon&quot;) is the sole living member. It had a thicker layer of blubber than other members of the order, an adaptation to the cold waters of its environment. Its tail was forked, like that of whales or dugongs. Lacking true teeth, it had an array of white bristles on its upper lip and two keratinous plates within its mouth for chewing. It fed mainly on kelp, and communicated with sighs and snorting sounds. Steller believed it was a monogamous and social animal living in small family groups and raising its young, similar to modern sirenians.

==Description==

Steller&#x27;s sea cows are reported to have grown to long as adults, much larger than extant sirenians. In 1987, a rather complete skeleton was found on Bering Island measuring . In 2017, another such skeleton was found on Bering Island measuring , and in life probably about . Georg Steller&#x27;s writings contain two contradictory estimates of weight: . The true value is estimated to fall between these figures, at about . This size made the sea cow one of the largest mammals of the Holocene epoch, along with baleen whales and some few toothed whales, and was likely an adaptation to reduce its surface-area to volume ratio and conserve heat.

Unlike other sirenians, Steller&#x27;s sea cow was positively buoyant, meaning that it was unable to submerge completely. It had a very thick outer skin, , to prevent injury from sharp rocks and ice and possibly to prevent unsubmerged skin from drying out. The sea cow&#x27;s blubber was thick, another adaptation to the frigid climate of the Bering Sea. Its skin was brownish-black, with white patches on some individuals. It was smooth along its back and rough on its sides, with crater-like depressions most likely caused by parasites. This rough texture led to the animal being nicknamed the &quot;bark animal&quot;. Hair on its body was sparse, but the insides of the sea cow&#x27;s flippers were covered in bristles. The fore limbs were roughly long, and the tail fluke was forked.

The sea cow&#x27;s head was small and short in comparison to its huge body. The animal&#x27;s upper lip was large and broad, extending so far beyond the lower jaw that the mouth appeared to be located underneath the skull. Unlike other sirenians, Steller&#x27;s sea cow was toothless and instead had a dense array of interlacing white bristles on its upper lip. The bristles were about in length and were used to tear seaweed stalks and hold food. The sea cow also had two keratinous plates, called ceratodontes, located on its palate and mandible, used for chewing. According to Steller, these plates (or &quot;masticatory pads&quot;) were held together by interdental papillae, a part of the gums, and had many small holes containing nerves and arteries.

As with all sirenians, the sea cow&#x27;s snout pointed downwards, which allowed it to better grasp kelp. The sea cow&#x27;s nostrils were roughly long and wide. In addition to those within its mouth, the sea cow also had stiff bristles long protruding from its muzzle. Steller&#x27;s sea cow had small eyes located halfway between its nostrils and ears with black irises, eyeballs, and canthi which were not externally visible. The animal had no eyelashes, but like other diving creatures such as sea otters, Steller&#x27;s sea cow had a nictitating membrane, which covered its eyes to prevent injury while feeding. The tongue was small and remained in the back of the mouth, unable to reach the masticatory (chewing) pads.

The sea cow&#x27;s spine is believed to have had seven cervical (neck), 17 thoracic, three lumbar, and 34 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Its ribs were large, with five of 17 pairs making contact with the sternum; it had no clavicles. As in all sirenians, the scapula of Steller&#x27;s sea cow was fan-shaped, being larger on the posterior side and narrower towards the neck. The anterior border of the scapula was nearly straight, whereas those of modern sirenians are curved. Like other sirenians, the bones of Steller&#x27;s sea cow were pachyosteosclerotic, meaning they were both bulky (pachyostotic) and dense (osteosclerotic). In all collected skeletons of the sea cow, the manus is missing; since &quot;Dusisiren&quot;—the sister taxon of &quot;Hydrodamalis&quot;—had reduced phalanges (finger bones), Steller&#x27;s sea cow possibly did not have a manus at all.

The sea cow&#x27;s heart was in weight; its stomach measured long and wide. The full length of its intestinal tract was about , equaling more than 20 times the animal&#x27;s length. The sea cow had no gallbladder, but did have a wide common bile duct. Its anus was in width, with its feces resembling those of horses. The male&#x27;s penis was long. Genetic evidence indicates convergent evolution with other marine mammals of genes related to metabolic and immune function, including leptin associated with energy homeostasis and reproductive regulation.

==Ecology and behavior==

Whether Steller&#x27;s sea cow had any natural predators is unknown. It may have been hunted by killer whales and sharks, though its buoyancy may have made it difficult for killer whales to drown, and the rocky kelp forests in which the sea cow lived may have deterred sharks. According to Steller, the adults guarded the young from predators.

Steller described an ectoparasite on the sea cows that was similar to the whale louse (&quot;Cyamus ovalis&quot;), but the parasite remains unidentified due to the host&#x27;s extinction and loss of all original specimens collected by Steller. It was first formally described as &quot;Sirenocyamus rhytinae&quot; in 1846 by Johann Friedrich von Brandt, although it has since been placed into the genus &quot;Cyamus&quot; as &quot;Cyamus rhytinae&quot;. It was the only species of cyamid amphipod to be reported inhabiting a sirenian. Steller also identified an endoparasite in the sea cows, which was likely an ascarid nematode.

Like other sirenians, Steller&#x27;s sea cow was an obligate herbivore and spent most of the day feeding, only lifting its head every 4–5 minutes for breathing. Kelp was its main food source, making it an algivore. The sea cow likely fed on several species of kelp, which have been identified as &quot;Agarum&quot; spp., &quot;Alaria praelonga&quot;, &quot;Halosaccion glandiforme&quot;, &quot;Laminaria saccharina&quot;, &quot;Nereocyctis luetkeana&quot;, and &quot;Thalassiophyllum clathrus&quot;. Steller&#x27;s sea cow only fed directly on the soft parts of the kelp, which caused the tougher stem and holdfast to wash up on the shore in heaps. The sea cow may have also fed on seagrass, but the plant was not common enough to support a viable population and could not have been the sea cow&#x27;s primary food source. Further, the available seagrasses in the sea cow&#x27;s range (&quot;Phyllospadix&quot; spp. and &quot;Zostera marina&quot;) may have grown too deep underwater or been too tough for the animal to consume. Since the sea cow floated, it likely fed on canopy kelp, as it is believed to have only had access to food no deeper than below the tide. Kelp releases a chemical deterrent to protect it from grazing, but canopy kelp releases a lower concentration of the chemical, allowing the sea cow to graze safely. Steller noted that the sea cow grew thin during the frigid winters, indicating a period of fasting due to low kelp growth. Fossils of Pleistocene Aleutian Island sea cow populations were larger than those from the Commander Islands, indicating that the growth of Commander Island sea cows may have been stunted due to a less favorable habitat and less food than the warmer Aleutian Islands.
Steller described the sea cow as being highly social (gregarious). It lived in small family groups and helped injured members, and was also apparently monogamous. Steller&#x27;s sea cow may have exhibited parental care, and the young were kept at the front of the herd for protection against predators. Steller reported that as a female was being captured, a group of other sea cows attacked the hunting boat by ramming and rocking it, and after the hunt, her mate followed the boat to shore, even after the captured animal had died. Mating season occurred in early spring and gestation took a little over a year, with calves likely delivered in autumn, as Steller observed a greater number of calves in autumn than at any other time of the year. Since female sea cows had only one set of mammary glands, they likely had one calf at a time.

The sea cow used its fore limbs for swimming, feeding, walking in shallow water, defending itself, and holding on to its partner during copulation. According to Steller, the fore limbs were also used to anchor the sea cow down to prevent it from being swept away by the strong nearshore waves. While grazing, the sea cow progressed slowly by moving its tail (fluke) from side to side; more rapid movement was achieved by strong vertical beating of the tail. They often slept on their backs after feeding. According to Steller, the sea cow was nearly mute and made only heavy breathing sounds, raspy snorting similar to a horse, and sighs.

Despite their large size, as with many other marine megafauna in the region, Steller&#x27;s sea cows may have been prey for the local transient orcas (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;); it is likely that they experienced predation, as Steller observed that foraging sea cows with calves would always keep their calves between themselves and the shore, and orcas would have been the most likely candidate for causing this behavior. In addition, early indigenous peoples of the North Pacific may have depended on the sea cow for food, and it is possible that this dependency may have extirpated the sea cow from portions of the North Pacific aside from the Commander Islands. Steller&#x27;s sea cows may have also had a mutualistic (or possibly even parasitic) relationship with local seabird species; Steller often observed birds perching on the exposed backs of the sea cows, feeding on the parasitic &quot;Cyamus rhytinae&quot;; this unique relationship that disappeared with the sea cows may have been a food source for many birds, and is similar to the recorded interactions between oxpeckers (&quot;Buphagus&quot;) and extant African megafauna.

==Taxonomy==
===Phylogeny===

Steller&#x27;s sea cow was a member of the genus &quot;Hydrodamalis&quot;, a group of large sirenians, whose sister taxon was &quot;Dusisiren&quot;. Like those of Steller&#x27;s sea cow, the ancestors of &quot;Dusisiren&quot; lived in tropical mangroves before adapting to the cold climates of the North Pacific. &quot;Hydrodamalis&quot; and &quot;Dusisiren&quot; are classified together in the subfamily Hydrodamalinae, which diverged from other sirenians around 4 to 8 mya. Steller&#x27;s sea cow is a member of the family Dugongidae, the sole surviving member of which, and thus Steller&#x27;s sea cow&#x27;s closest living relative, is the dugong (&quot;Dugong dugon&quot;).

Steller&#x27;s sea cow was a direct descendant of the Cuesta sea cow (&quot;H. cuestae&quot;), an extinct tropical sea cow that lived off the coast of western North America, particularly California. The Cuesta sea cow is thought to have become extinct due to the onset of the Quaternary glaciation and the subsequent cooling of the oceans. Many populations died out, but the lineage of Steller&#x27;s sea cow was able to adapt to the colder temperatures. The Takikawa sea cow (&quot;H. spissa&quot;) of Japan is thought of by some researchers to be a taxonomic synonym of the Cuesta sea cow, but based on a comparison of endocasts, the Takikawa and Steller&#x27;s sea cows are more derived than the Cuesta sea cow. This has led some to believe that the Takikawa sea cow is its own species. The evolution of the genus &quot;Hydrodamalis&quot; was characterized by increased size, and a loss of teeth and phalanges, as a response to the onset of the Quaternary glaciation.

===Research history===
Steller&#x27;s sea cow was discovered in 1741 by Georg Wilhelm Steller, and was named after him. Steller researched the wildlife of Bering Island while he was shipwrecked there for about a year; the animals on the island included relict populations of sea cows, sea otters, Steller sea lions, and northern fur seals. As the crew hunted the animals to survive, Steller described them in detail. Steller&#x27;s account was included in his posthumous publication &quot;De bestiis marinis&quot;, or &quot;The Beasts of the Sea&quot;, which was published in 1751 by the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. Zoologist Eberhard von Zimmermann formally described Steller&#x27;s sea cow in 1780 as &quot;Manati gigas&quot;. Biologist Anders Jahan Retzius in 1794 put the sea cow in the new genus &quot;Hydrodamalis&quot;, with the specific name of &quot;stelleri&quot;, in honor of Steller. In 1811, naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger reclassified Steller&#x27;s sea cow into the genus &quot;Rytina&quot;, which many writers at the time adopted. The name &quot;Hydrodamalis gigas&quot;, the correct &quot;combinatio nova&quot; if a separate genus is recognised, was first used in 1895 by Theodore Sherman Palmer.
For decades after its discovery, no skeletal remains of a Steller&#x27;s sea cow were known. This may have been due to rising and falling sea levels over the course of the Quaternary period, which could have left many sea cow bones hidden. The first bones of a Steller&#x27;s sea cow were unearthed in about 1840, over 70 years after it was presumed to have become extinct. The first partial sea cow skull was discovered in 1844 by Ilya Voznesensky while on the Commander Islands, and the first skeleton was discovered in 1855 on northern Bering Island. These specimens were sent to Saint Petersburg in 1857, and another nearly complete skeleton arrived in Moscow around 1860. Until recently, all the full skeletons were found during the 19th century, being the most productive period in terms of unearthed skeletal remains, from 1878 to 1883. During this time, 12 of the 22 skeletons having known dates of collection were discovered. Some authors did not believe possible the recovery of further significant skeletal material from the Commander Islands after this period, but a skeleton was found in 1983, and two zoologists collected about 90 bones in 1991. Only two to four skeletons of the sea cow exhibited in various museums of the world originate from a single individual. It is known that Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, Benedykt Dybowski, and Leonhard Hess Stejneger unearthed many skeletal remains from different individuals in the late 1800s, from which composite skeletons were assembled. As of 2006, 27 nearly complete skeletons and 62 complete skulls have been found, but most of them are assemblages of bones from two to 16 different individuals.

===Illustrations===

The Pallas Picture is the only known drawing of Steller&#x27;s sea cow believed to be from a complete specimen. It was published by Peter Simon Pallas in his 1840 work &quot;Icones ad Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica&quot;. Pallas did not specify a source; Stejneger suggested it may have been one of the original illustrations produced by Friedrich Plenisner, a member of Vitus Bering&#x27;s crew as a painter and surveyor who drew a figure of a female sea cow on Steller&#x27;s request. Most of Plenisner&#x27;s depictions were lost during transit from Siberia to Saint Petersburg.

Another drawing of Steller&#x27;s sea cow similar to the Pallas Picture appeared on a 1744 map drawn by Sven Waxell and Sofron Chitrow. The picture may have also been based upon a specimen, and was published in 1893 by Pekarski. The map depicted Vitus Bering&#x27;s route during the Great Northern Expedition, and featured illustrations of Steller&#x27;s sea cow and Steller&#x27;s sea lion in the upper-left corner. The drawing contains some inaccurate features such as the inclusion of eyelids and fingers, leading to doubt that it was drawn from a specimen.

Johann Friedrich von Brandt, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences, had the &quot;Ideal Image&quot; drawn in 1846 based upon the Pallas Picture, and then the &quot;Ideal Picture&quot; in 1868 based upon collected skeletons. Two other possible drawings of Steller&#x27;s sea cow were found in 1891 in Waxell&#x27;s manuscript diary. There was a map depicting a sea cow, as well as a Steller sea lion and a northern fur seal. The sea cow was depicted with large eyes, a large head, claw-like hands, exaggerated folds on the body, and a tail fluke in perspective lying horizontally rather than vertically. The drawing may have been a distorted depiction of a juvenile, as the figure bears a resemblance to a manatee calf. Another similar image was found by Alexander von Middendorff in 1867 in the library of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and is probably a copy of the Tsarskoye Selo Picture.

==Range==

The range of Steller&#x27;s sea cow at the time of its discovery was apparently restricted to the shallow seas around the Commander Islands, which include Bering and Copper Islands. The Commander Islands remained uninhabited until 1825, when the Russian-American Company relocated Aleuts from Attu Island and Atka Island there.

The first fossils discovered outside the Commander Islands were found in interglacial Pleistocene deposits in Amchitka, and further fossils dating to the late Pleistocene were found in Monterey Bay, California, and Honshu, Japan. This suggests that the sea cow had a far more extensive range in prehistoric times. It cannot be excluded that these fossils belong to other &quot;Hydrodamalis&quot; species. The southernmost find is a Middle Pleistocene rib bone from the Bōsō Peninsula of Japan. The remains of three individuals were found preserved in the South Bight Formation of Amchitka; as late Pleistocene interglacial deposits are rare in the Aleutians, the discovery suggests that sea cows were abundant in that era. According to Steller, the sea cow often resided in the shallow, sandy shorelines and in the mouths of freshwater rivers. Genetic evidence suggests Steller&#x27;s sea cow, as well as the modern dugong, suffered a population bottleneck (a significant reduction in population) bottoming roughly 400,000 years ago.

Bone fragments and accounts by native Aleut people suggest that sea cows also historically inhabited the Near Islands, potentially with viable populations that were in contact with humans in the western Aleutian Islands prior to Steller&#x27;s discovery in 1741. A sea cow rib discovered in 1998 on Kiska Island was dated to around 1,000 years old, and is now in the possession of the Burke Museum in Seattle. The dating may be skewed due to the marine reservoir effect which causes radiocarbon-dated marine specimens to appear several hundred years older than they are. Marine reservoir effect is caused by the large reserves of C14 in the ocean, and it is more likely that the animal died between 1710 and 1785. A 2004 study reported that sea cow bones discovered on Adak Island were around 1,700 years old, and sea cow bones discovered on Buldir Island were found to be around 1,600 years old. It is possible the bones were from cetaceans and were misclassified. Rib bones of a Steller&#x27;s sea cow have also been found on St. Lawrence Island, and the specimen is thought to have lived between 800 and 920 CE.

==Interactions with humans==
===Extinction===
Genetic evidence suggests the Steller&#x27;s sea cows around the Commander Islands were the last of a much more ubiquitous population dispersed across the North Pacific coastal zones. They had the same genetic diversity as the last and rather inbred population of woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island. During glacial periods and reduction in sea levels and temperatures, suitable habitat substantially regressed, fragmenting the population. By the time sea levels stabilized around 5,000 years ago, the population had already plummeted. Together, these indicate that even without human influence, the Steller&#x27;s sea cow would have still been a dead clade walking, with the vast majority of the population having already gone extinct from natural climatic and sea level shifts, with the tiny remaining population at major risk from a genetic extinction vortex.
The presence of Steller&#x27;s sea cows in the Aleutian Islands may have caused the Aleut people to migrate westward to hunt them. This possibly led to the sea cow&#x27;s extirpation in that area, assuming it had not already happened yet, but the archaeological evidence is inconclusive. One factor potentially leading to extinction of Steller&#x27;s sea cow, specifically off the coast of St. Lawrence Island, was the Siberian Yupik people who have inhabited St. Lawrence island for 2,000 years. They may have hunted the sea cows into extinction, as the natives have a dietary culture heavily dependent upon marine mammals. The onset of the Medieval Warm Period, which reduced the availability of kelp, may have also been the cause for their local extinction in that area. It has also been argued that the decline of Steller&#x27;s sea cow may have been an indirect effect of the harvesting of sea otters by the area&#x27;s aboriginal people. With the otter population reduced, the sea urchin population would have increased, in turn reducing the stock of kelp, its principal food. In historic times, though, aboriginal hunting had depleted sea otter populations only in localized areas, and as the sea cow would have been easy prey for aboriginal hunters, accessible populations may have been exterminated with or without simultaneous otter hunting. In any event, the range of the sea cow was limited to coastal areas off uninhabited islands by the time Bering arrived, and the animal was already endangered.

When Europeans discovered them, there may have been only 2,000 individuals left. This small population was quickly wiped out by fur traders, seal hunters, and others who followed Vitus Bering&#x27;s route past its habitat to Alaska. It was also hunted to collect its valuable subcutaneous fat. The animal was hunted and used by Ivan Krassilnikov in 1754 and Ivan Korovin 1762, but Dimitri Bragin, in 1772, and others later, did not see it. Brandt thus concluded that by 1768, twenty-seven years after it had been discovered by Europeans, the species was extinct. In 1887, Stejneger estimated that there had been fewer than 1,500 individuals remaining at the time of Steller&#x27;s discovery, and argued there was already an immediate danger of the sea cow&#x27;s extinction.

The first attempt to hunt the animal by Steller and the other crew members was unsuccessful due to its strength and thick hide. They had attempted to impale it and haul it to shore using a large hook and heavy cable, but the crew could not pierce its skin. In a second attempt a month later, a harpooner speared an animal, and men on shore hauled it in while others repeatedly stabbed it with bayonets. It was dragged into shallow waters, and the crew waited until the tide receded and it was beached to butcher it. After this, they were hunted with relative ease, the challenge being in hauling the animal back to shore. This bounty inspired maritime fur traders to detour to the Commander Islands and restock their food supplies during North Pacific expeditions.

==== Impact of extinction ====
While not a keystone species, Steller&#x27;s sea cows likely influenced the community composition of the kelp forests they inhabited, and also boosted their productivity and resilience to environmental stressors by allowing more light into kelp forests and more kelp to grow, and enhancing the recruitment and dispersal of kelp through their feeding behavior. In the modern day, the flow of nutrients from kelp forests to adjacent ecosystems is regulated by the seasons, with seasonal storms and currents being the primary factor. The Steller&#x27;s sea cow may have allowed this flow to continue year-round, thus allowing for more productivity in adjacent habitats. The disturbance caused by the Steller&#x27;s sea cow may have facilitated the dispersal of kelp, most notably &quot;Nereocystis&quot; species, to other habitats, allowing recruitment and colonization of new areas, and facilitating genetic exchange. Their presence may have also allowed sea otters and large marine invertebrates to coexist, indicating a commonly-documented decline in marine invertebrate populations driven by sea otters (an example being in populations of the black leather chiton) may be due to lost ecosystem functions associated with the Steller&#x27;s sea cow. This indicates that due to the sea cow&#x27;s extinction, the ecosystem dynamics and resilience of North Pacific kelp forests may have already been compromised well before more well-known modern stressors like overharvesting and climate change.

===Later reported sightings===
Sea cow sightings have been reported after Brandt&#x27;s official 1768 date of extinction. Lucien Turner, an American ethnologist and naturalist, said the natives of Attu Island reported that the sea cows survived into the 1800s, and were sometimes hunted.

In 1963, the official journal of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR published an article announcing a possible sighting. The previous year, the whaling ship &quot;Buran&quot; had reported a group of large marine mammals grazing on seaweed in shallow water off Kamchatka, in the Gulf of Anadyr. The crew reported seeing six of these animals ranging from , with trunks and split lips. There have also been alleged sightings by local fishermen in the northern Kuril Islands, and around the Kamchatka and Chukchi peninsulas.

===Uses===
Steller&#x27;s sea cow was described as being &quot;tasty&quot; by Steller; the meat was said to have a taste similar to corned beef, though it was tougher, redder, and needed to be cooked longer. The meat was abundant on the animal, and slow to spoil, perhaps due to the high amount of salt in the animal&#x27;s diet effectively curing it. The fat could be used for cooking and as an odorless lamp oil. The crew of the St. Peter drank the fat in cups and Steller described it as having a taste like almond oil. The thick, sweet milk of female sea cows could be drunk or made into butter, and the thick, leathery hide could be used to make clothing, such as shoes and belts, and large skin boats sometimes called baidarkas or umiaks.

Towards the end of the 19th century, bones and fossils from the extinct animal were valuable and often sold to museums at high prices. Most were collected during this time, limiting trade after 1900. Some are still sold commercially, as the highly dense cortical bone is well-suited for making items such as knife handles and decorative carvings. Because the sea cow is extinct, native artisan products made in Alaska from this &quot;mermaid ivory&quot; are legal to sell in the United States and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restrict the trade of marine mammal products. Although the distribution is legal, the sale of unfossilized bones is generally prohibited and trade in products made of the bones is regulated because some of the material is unlikely to be authentic and probably comes from arctic cetaceans.

The ethnographer Elizabeth Porfirevna Orlova, from the Russian Museum of Ethnography, was working on the Commander Island Aleuts from August to September 1961. Her research includes notes about a game of accuracy, called &quot;kakan&quot; (&quot;stones&quot;) played with the bones of the Steller&#x27;s sea cow. Kakan was usually played at home between adults during bad weather, at least during Orlova&#x27;s fieldwork.

===In literature, media, and folklore===
In the story &quot;The White Seal&quot; from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; by Rudyard Kipling, which takes place in the Bering Sea, Kotick the rare white seal consults Sea Cow during his journey to find a new home.

&quot;Tales of a Sea Cow&quot; is a 2012 docufiction film by Icelandic-French artist Etienne de France about a fictional 2006 discovery of Steller&#x27;s sea cows off the coast of Greenland. The film has been exhibited in art museums and universities in Europe.

Steller&#x27;s sea cows appear in two books of poetry: &quot;Nach der Natur&quot; (1995) by Winfried Georg Sebald, and &quot;Species Evanescens&quot; (2009) by Russian poet Andrei Bronnikov. Bronnikov&#x27;s book depicts the events of the Great Northern Expedition through the eyes of Steller; Sebald&#x27;s book looks at the conflict between man and nature, including the extinction of Steller&#x27;s sea cow.

The novel &quot;Elolliset&quot; (Living things) (2023) by Finnish author and literary scholar Iida Turpeinen uses Steller&#x27;s sea cow and its demise as a central theme. It features multiple characters at different times in history that were involved with the animal, beginning from Steller’s expedition and telling how the complete skeleton was conserved and ended up in the Helsinki museum of natural history.

Scottish poet John Glenday published the poem &quot;The Kelp Eaters&quot; in his 2003 volume, Grain, describing the beauty and loving nature of the sea cows and their harpooning by the narrator and his companions. The poem carries the epigraph &quot;From “Journal of a Voyage with Bering 1741-1742” By Georg Wilhelm Steller&quot;.

=== Genetic research and potential revival ===
In 2021, the nuclear genome of the species was sequenced from skeletal remains. The reconstructed genome showed that the species was already declining due to low genetic diversity caused by climate change and hunting by Paleolithic humans prior to its discovery by Steller, similar to the final populations of woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island. A year later, in late 2022, a group of Russian scientists funded by Sergi Bachin began research to potentially revive the species and reintroduce it to the Bering Sea. Arctic Sirenia plans to revive the species through genome editing of the dugong, but an artificial womb is necessary to conceive a living sea cow due to the lack of an appropriate living surrogate species. Ben Lamm of Colossal Biosciences has also stated that he and his company want to revive the species after they complete their first four projects (woolly mammoth, dodo, thylacine, and northern white rhinoceros) and have an artificial animal womb developed.

Susa is mentioned in the Ketuvim of the Hebrew Bible by the name Shushan, mainly in the Book of Esther, but also once each in the books of Ezra (Ezra 4:9), Nehemiah (Nehemiah 1:1) and Daniel (Daniel 8:2). According to these texts, Nehemiah lived in Susa during the Babylonian captivity of the 6th century BC (Daniel mentions it in a prophetic vision), while Esther became queen there, married to King Ahasuerus, and saved the Jews from genocide. A tomb presumed to be that of Daniel is located in the area, known as &quot;Shush-Daniel&quot;. However, a large portion of the current structure is actually a much later construction dated to the late nineteenth century, .

=== Pseudepigrapha ===

Susa is further mentioned in the &quot;Book of Jubilees&quot; (8:21 &amp; 9:2) as one of the places within the inheritance of Shem and his eldest son Elam; and in 8:1, &quot;Susan&quot; is also named as the son (or daughter, in some translations) of Elam.

== Excavation history ==


The site was examined in 1836 by Henry Rawlinson and then by A. H. Layard.

In 1851, some modest excavation was done by William Loftus, accompanied by Fenwick Williams, who identified it as Susa. Among his finds was a jar containing around 110 coins, the earliest of which was dated to 697-98 AD.

In 1885 and 1886 Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy and Jane Dieulafoy began the first French excavations, discovering glazed bricks, column bases, and capitals from the palace of the Achaemenid kings. However, they failed to identify mudbrick walls, which were then destroyed in the course of excavation. Almost all of the excavations at Susa, post-1885, were organized and authorized by the French government.

In two treaties in 1894 and 1899, the French gained a monopoly on all archaeological excavations in Iran indefinitely. Jacques de Morgan, after visiting the site in 1891, conducted major excavations from 1897 until 1911. The excavations that were conducted in Susa brought many artistic and historical artifacts back to France. These artifacts filled multiple halls in the Museum of the Louvre throughout the late 1890s and early 1900s. De Morgan&#x27;s most important work was the excavation of the Grande Tranchée in the Acropole mound, where he found the stele of Naram-Sin, a collection of Babylonian kudurrus (boundary stones), the stele bearing the Code of Hammurabi, an ornamented bronze table of snakes, the bronze statue of Queen Napir-Asu, and thousands of inscribed bricks. His finds showed Susa to be the most important center of Elamite civilization, which was effectively discovered by the French mission at Susa.

Excavation efforts continued under Roland De Mecquenem until 1914, at the beginning of World War I. French work at Susa resumed after the war, led by De Mecquenem, continuing until World War II in 1940. To supplement the original publications of De Mecquenem the archives of his excavation have now been put online thanks to a grant from the Shelby White Levy Program.

Roman Ghirshman took over direction of the French efforts in 1946, after the end of the war. Together with his wife Tania Ghirshman, he continued there until 1967. The Ghirshmans concentrated on excavating a single part of the site, the hectare sized Ville Royale, taking it all the way down to bare earth. The pottery found at the various levels enabled a stratigraphy to be developed for Susa.

From 1969 until 1979 excavations were conducted under Jean Perrot.

In 2019 the Susa salvage project was launched to counter the construction of a transportation underpass in the vicinity of the site.

== History ==

=== Early settlement ===

In urban history, Susa is one of the oldest-known settlements of the region. Based on calibrated carbon-14 dating, the foundation of a settlement there occurred as early as 4200 BC. In the region around Susa were a number of towns (with their own platforms) and villages that maintained a trading relationship with the city, especially those along the Zagro frontier.

The founding of Susa corresponded with the abandonment of nearby villages. Potts suggests that the settlement may have been founded to try to reestablish the previously destroyed settlement at Chogha Mish, about 25 km to the west. Previously, Chogha Mish was a very large settlement, and it featured a similar massive platform that was later built at Susa.

Another important settlement in the area is Chogha Bonut, which was discovered in 1976.

=== Susa I period (4200–3800 BC) ===
Shortly after Susa was first settled over 6000 years ago, its inhabitants erected a monumental platform that rose over the flat surrounding landscape. The exceptional nature of the site is still recognizable today in the artistry of the ceramic vessels that were placed as offerings in a thousand or more graves near the base of the temple platform.

Susa&#x27;s earliest settlement is known as the &quot;Susa I&quot; period (c. 4200–3900 BC). Two settlements named by archaeologists the &quot;Acropolis&quot; (7 ha) and the &quot;Apadana&quot; (6.3 ha), would later merge to form Susa proper (18 ha). The &quot;Apadana&quot; was enclosed by 6 metre thick walls of rammed earth (this particular place is named Apadana because it also contains a late Achaemenid structure of this type).

Nearly two thousand pots of &quot;Susa I&quot; style were recovered from the cemetery, most of them now in the Louvre. The vessels found are eloquent testimony to the artistic and technical achievements of their makers, and they hold clues about the organization of the society that commissioned them.
Painted ceramic vessels from Susa in the earliest first style are a late, regional version of the Mesopotamian Ubaid ceramic tradition that spread across the Near East during the fifth millennium BC. Susa I style was very much a product of the past and of influences from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types—a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar—implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute a large proportion of the vessels from the cemetery. Others are coarse cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children. The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.

==== Metallurgy ====
Copper metallurgy is also attested during this period, which was contemporary with metalwork at some highland Iranian sites such as Tepe Sialk.

As many as 40 copper axes have been found at the Susa cemetery, as well as 10 round discs probably used as mirrors. Many awls and spatulas were also found.

: &quot;Metal finds from the burials in Susa are the major metal assemblage from the end of the 5th millennium BCE. Strata 27 to 25 contained the earliest burials with a large number of axes, made from unalloyed copper and copper with elevated As [Arsenic] levels.&quot;

The cemetery of Chega Sofla, from the same timeframe, provides a lot of similar material, with many sophisticated metal objects. Chega Sofla is located in the same geographical area.

==== Ceramic objects ====
=== Susa II and Uruk influence (3800–3100 BC) ===

Susa came within the Uruk cultural sphere during the Uruk period. An imitation of the entire state apparatus of Uruk, proto-writing, cylinder seals with Sumerian motifs, and monumental architecture is found at Susa. According to some scholars, Susa may have been a colony of Uruk.

There is some dispute about the comparative periodization of Susa and Uruk at this time, as well as about the extent of Uruk influence in Susa. Recent research indicates that Early Uruk period corresponds to Susa II period.

Daniel T. Potts, argues that the influence from the highland Iranian Khuzestan area in Susa was more significant at the early period, and also continued later on. Thus, Susa combined the influence of two cultures, from the highland area and from the alluvial plains. Potts also stresses the fact that the writing and numerical systems of Uruk were not simply borrowed in Susa wholesale. Rather, only partial and selective borrowing took place, that was adapted to Susa&#x27;s needs. Despite the fact that Uruk was far larger than Susa at the time, Susa was not its colony, but still maintained some independence for a long time, according to Potts. An architectural link has also been suggested between Susa, Tal-i Malyan, and Godin Tepe at this time, in support of the idea of the parallel development of the Proto-Cuneiform and proto-elamite scripts.

Some scholars believe that Susa was part of the greater Uruk culture. Holly Pittman, an art historian at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia says, &quot;they Susanians are participating entirely in an Uruk way of life. They are not culturally distinct; the material culture of Susa is a regional variation of that on the Mesopotamian plain&quot;. Gilbert Stein, director of the University of Chicago&#x27;s Oriental Institute, says that &quot;An expansion once thought to have lasted less than 200 years now apparently went on for 700 years. It is hard to think of any colonial system lasting that long. The spread of Uruk material is not evidence of Uruk domination; it could be local choice&quot;.

=== Susa III, or &quot;Proto-Elamite&quot;, period (3100–2700 BC) ===
Susa III (3100–2700 BC) is also known as the &#x27;Proto-Elamite&#x27; period. At this time, Banesh period pottery is predominant. This is also when the Proto-Elamite tablets first appear in the record. Subsequently, Susa became the centre of Elam civilization.

Ambiguous reference to Elam () appear also in this period in Sumerian records. Susa enters recorded history in the Early Dynastic period of Sumer. A battle between Kish and Susa is recorded in 2700 BC, when En-me-barage-si is said to have &quot;made the land of Elam submit&quot;.

===Elamites===

In the Sumerian period, Susa was the capital of a state called Susiana (Šušan), which occupied approximately the same territory of modern Khūzestān Province centered on the Karun River. Control of Susiana shifted between Elam, Sumer, and Akkad.

During the Elamite monarchy, many riches and materials were brought to Susa from the plundering of other cities. This was mainly due to the fact of Susa&#x27;s location on Iran&#x27;s South Eastern region, closer to the city of Babylon and cities in Mesopotamia.

The use of the Elamite language as an administrative language was first attested in texts of ancient Ansan, Tall-e Mal-yan, dated 1000 BC. Previous to the era of Elamites, the Akkadian language was responsible for most or all of the text used in ancient documents. Susiana was incorporated by Sargon the Great into his Akkadian Empire in approximately 2330 BC.
The main goddess of the city was Nanaya, who had a significant temple in Susa.

====Old Elamite period (c. 2700–1500 BC)====

The Old Elamite period began around 2700 BC. Historical records mention the conquest of Elam by Enmebaragesi, the Sumerian king of Kish in Mesopotamia. Three dynasties ruled during this period. Twelve kings of each of the first two dynasties, those of Awan (or &quot;Avan&quot;; c. 2400–2100 BC) and Simashki (c. 2100–1970 BC), are known from a list from Susa dating to the Old Babylonian period. Two Elamite dynasties said to have exercised brief control over parts of Sumer in very early times include Awan and Hamazi; and likewise, several of the stronger Sumerian rulers, such as Eannatum of Lagash and Lugal-anne-mundu of Adab, are recorded as temporarily dominating Elam.

====Kutik-Inshushinak====
Susa was the capital of an Akkadian province until ca. 2100 BC, when its governor, Kutik-Inshushinak, rebelled and made it an independent state and a literary center. Also, he was the last from the Awan dynasty according to the Susa kinglist. He unified the neighbouring territories and became the king of Elam. He encouraged the use of the Linear Elamite script, that remains undeciphered.

The city was subsequently conquered by the neo-Sumerian Third Dynasty of Ur and held until Ur finally collapsed at the hands of the Elamites under Kindattu in ca. 2004 BC. At this time, Susa was ruled by Elam again and became its capital under the Shimashki dynasty.

===Indus-Susa relations (2400–2100 BC)===
Numerous artifacts of Indus Valley civilization origin have been found in Susa from this period, especially seals and etched carnelian beads, pointing to Indus-Mesopotamia relations during this period.

====Middle Elamite period (c. 1500–1100 BC)====

Around 1500 BC, the Middle Elamite period began with the rise of the Anshanite dynasties. Their rule was characterized by an &quot;Elamisation&quot; of Susa, and the kings took the title &quot;king of Anshan and Susa&quot;. While, previously, the Akkadian language was frequently used in inscriptions, the succeeding kings, such as the Igihalkid dynasty of c. 1400 BC, tried to use Elamite. Thus, Elamite language and culture grew in importance in Susiana.

This was also the period when the Elamite pantheon was being imposed in Susiana. This policy reached its height with the construction of the political and religious complex at Chogha Zanbil, south-east of Susa.

In ca. 1175 BC, the Elamites under Shutruk-Nahhunte plundered the original stele bearing the &quot;Code of Hammurabi&quot; and took it to Susa. Archeologists found it in 1901. Nebuchadnezzar I of the Babylonian empire plundered Susa around fifty years later.

====Neo-Elamite period (c. 1100–540 BC)====

=====Neo-Assyrians=====

In 647 BC, Neo-Assyrian king Ashurbanipal leveled the city during a war in which the people of Susa participated on the other side. A tablet unearthed in 1854 by Austen Henry Layard in Nineveh reveals Ashurbanipal as an &quot;avenger&quot;, seeking retribution for the humiliations that the Elamites had inflicted on the Mesopotamians over the centuries:
&quot;Susa, the great holy city, abode of their gods, seat of their mysteries, I conquered. I entered its palaces, I opened their treasuries where silver and gold, goods and wealth were amassed. . . .I destroyed the ziggurat of Susa. I smashed its shining copper horns. I reduced the temples of Elam to naught; their gods and goddesses I scattered to the winds. The tombs of their ancient and recent kings I devastated, I exposed to the sun, and I carried away their bones toward the land of Ashur. I devastated the provinces of Elam and, on their lands, I sowed salt.&quot;
Assyrian rule of Susa began in 647 BC and lasted till Median capture of Susa in 617 BC.

===Susa after Achaemenid Persian conquest===

Susa underwent a major political and ethnocultural transition when it became part of the Persian Achaemenid empire between 540 and 539 BC when it was captured by Cyrus the Great during his conquest of Elam (Susiana), of which Susa was the capital. The Nabonidus Chronicle records that, prior to the battle(s), Nabonidus had ordered cult statues from outlying Babylonian cities to be brought into the capital, suggesting that the conflict over Susa had begun possibly in the winter of 540 BC.

It is probable that Cyrus negotiated with the Babylonian generals to obtain a compromise on their part and therefore avoid an armed confrontation. Nabonidus was staying in the city at the time and soon fled to the capital, Babylon, which he had not visited in years.
Cyrus&#x27; conquest of Susa and the rest of Babylonia commenced a fundamental shift, bringing Susa under Persian control for the first time. Strabo stated that Cyrus made Susa an imperial capital though there was no new construction in that period so this is in dispute.

Under Cyrus&#x27; son Cambyses II, Susa became a center of political power as one of four capitals of the Achaemenid Persian empire, while reducing the significance of Pasargadae as the capital of Persis. Following Cambyses&#x27; brief rule, Darius the Great began a major building program in Susa and Persepolis, which included building a large palace. During this time he describes his new capital in an inscription:

&quot;This palace which I built at Susa, from afar its ornamentation was brought. Downward the earth was dug, until I reached rock in the earth. When the excavation had been made, then rubble was packed down, some 40 cubits in depth, another part 20 cubits in depth. On that rubble the palace was constructed.&quot;

The city forms the setting of &quot;The Persians&quot; (472 BC), an Athenian tragedy by the ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus that is the oldest surviving play in the history of theatre.

Events mentioned in the Old Testament book of Esther are said to have occurred in Susa during the Achaemenid period. The King Ahasuerus mentioned in that book may refer to Xerxes I (486-465 BC).

=== Seleucid period ===

Susa lost much of its importance after the invasion of Alexander the Great of Macedon in 331 BC. In 324 BC he met Nearchus here, who explored the Persian Gulf as he returned from the Indus River by sea. In that same year Alexander celebrated in Susa with a mass wedding between the Persians and Macedonians.

The city retained its importance under the Seleucids for approximately one century after Alexander, however Susa lost its position of imperial capital to Seleucia on the Tigris to become the regional capital of the satrapy of Susiana. Nevertheless, Susa retained its economic importance to the empire with its vast assortment of merchants conducting trade in Susa, using Charax Spasinou as its port.

The city was named Seleucia on the Eulaeus or Seleucia ad Eulaeum.

Seleucus I Nicator minted coins there in substantial quantities. Susa is rich in Greek inscriptions, perhaps indicating a significant number of Greeks living in the city. Especially in the royal city large, well-equipped peristyle houses have been excavated.

=== Parthian period ===

Around 147 BC Susa and the adjacent Elymais broke free from the Seleucid Empire. The city was at least temporarily ruled by the rulers of the Elymais with Kamnaskires II Nikephoros minting coins there. The city may again have briefly returned to Seleucid rule, but starting with Phraates II (about 138–127 BC) to Gotarzes II (about 40–51 AD) almost all rulers of the Parthian Empire coined coins in the city, indicating that it was firmly in the hands of the Parthians at least during this period. The city however retained a considerable amount of independence and retained its Greek city-state organization well into the ensuing Parthian period. From second half of the first century it was probably partly governed by rulers of Elymais again, but it became Parthian once again in 215.

Susa was a frequent place of refuge for Parthian and later, the Persian Sassanid kings, as the Romans sacked Ctesiphon five different times between 116 and 297 AD. Susa was briefly captured in 116 AD by the Roman emperor Trajan during the course of his Parthian campaign. Never again would the Roman Empire advance so far to the east.

=== Sassanid period ===

Suzan was conquered and destroyed in 224 AD by the Sassanid Ardashir I, but rebuilt immediately thereafter, and perhaps even temporarily a royal residence. According to a later tradition, Shapur I is said to have spent his twilight years in the city, although this tradition is uncertain and perhaps refers more to Shapur II.

Under the Sassanids, following the founding of Gundeshapur Susa slowly lost its importance. Archaeologically, the Sassanid city is less dense compared to the Parthian period, but there were still significant buildings, with the settlement extending over 400 hectares.
Susa was also still very significant economically and a trading center, especially in gold trading. Coins also continued to be minted in the city. The city had a Christian community in a separate district with a Nestorian bishop, whose last representative is attested to in 1265. Archaeologically a stucco panel with the image of a Christian saint has been found.

During the reign of Shapur II after Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire in 312, and the identification of Christians as possible collaborators with the enemy Christians living in the Sasanian Empire were persecuted from 339 onwards. Shapur II also imposed a double tax on the Christians during his war campaign against the Romans. Following a rebellion of Christians living in Susa, the king destroyed the city in 339 using 300 elephants. He later had the city rebuilt and resettled with prisoners of war and weavers, which is believed to have been after his victory over the Romans in Amida in 359. The weaver produced silk brocade. He renamed it &quot;Eran-Khwarrah-Shapur&quot; (&quot;Iran&#x27;s glory [built by] Shapur&quot;).

=== Islamic period ===

During the Muslim conquest of Persia an Arab army invaded Khuzistan under the command of Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari. After taking most of the smaller fortified towns the army captured Tustar in 642 before proceeding to besiege Susa. A place of military importance, it also held the tomb of the Jewish prophet Daniel.
Two stories are given in the Muslim sources of how the city fell. In the first, a Persian priest proclaimed from the walls that only a &quot;dajjal&quot; was fated to capture the city. A &quot;dajjal&quot; is an Islamic term for an &quot;Al-Masih ad-Dajjal&quot;, a false messiah, compatible to the Antichrist in Christianity. In everyday use, it also means &quot;deceiver&quot; or &quot;imposter&quot;. Siyah, a Persian general who had defected to Muslim side, claimed that by converting to Islam he had turned his back on Zoroastrianism and was thus a &quot;dajjal&quot;. Abu Musa agreed to Siyah&#x27;s plan. Soon after as the sun came up one morning, the sentries on the walls saw a man in a Persian officer&#x27;s uniform covered in blood lying on the ground before the main gate. Thinking it he had been left out overnight after a conflict the previous day, they opened the gate and some came out to collect him. As they approached, Siyah jumped up and killed them. Before the other sentries had time to react, Siyah and a small group of Muslim soldiers hidden nearby charged through the open gate. They held the gate open long enough for Muslim reinforcements to arrive and passing through the gate to take the city.

In the other story, once again the Muslims were taunted from the city wall that only an &quot;Al-Masih ad-Dajjal&quot; could capture the city, and since there were none in the besieging army then they may as well give up and go home. One of the Muslim commanders was so angry and frustrated at this taunt that he went up to one of the city gates and kicked it. Instantly the chains snapped, the locks broke and it fell open.
Following their entry into the city, the Muslims killed all of the Persian nobles.

Once the city was taken, as Daniel () was not mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an, the initial reaction of the Muslim was to destroy the cult by confiscating the treasure that had stored at the tomb since the time of the Achaemenids. They then broke open the silver coffin and carried off the mummified corpse, removing from the corpse a signet ring, which carried an image of a man between two lions. However, upon hearing what had happened, the caliph Umar ordered the ring to be returned and the body reburied under the riverbed. In time, Daniel became a Muslim cult figure and they as well as Christians began making pilgrimages to the site, despite several other places claiming to be the site of Daniel&#x27;s grave.

Following the capture of Susa, the Muslims moved on to besiege Gundeshapur.

Susa recovered following its capture and remained a regional center of more than 400 hectares in size. A mosque was built, but also Nestorian bishops are still testifie. In addition, there was a Jewish community with its own synagogue.
The city continued to be a manufacturing center of luxury fabrics during this period. Archaeologically, the Islamic period is characterized mainly by its rich ceramics. Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province) had a significant Christian population during the first millennium, and was a diocese of the Church of the East between the 5th and 13th centuries, in the metropolitan province of Beth Huzaye (Elam).

In 1218, the city was razed by invading Mongols and was never able to regain its previous importance. The city further degraded in the 15th century when the majority of its population moved to Dezful.

=== Today ===

Today the ancient center of Susa is unoccupied, with the population living in the adjacent modern Iranian town of Shush to the west and north of the historic ruins. Shush is the administrative capital of Shush County in Iran&#x27;s Khuzestan province. It had a population of 64,960 in 2005.

<text>The Battle of Maldon took place on 10 or 11 August 991 AD near Maldon beside the River Blackwater in Essex, England, during the reign of Æthelred the Unready. Earl Byrhtnoth and his thegns led the English against a Viking invasion. The battle ended in an Anglo-Saxon defeat. After the battle Archbishop Sigeric of Canterbury and the aldermen of the south-western provinces advised King Æthelred to buy off the Vikings rather than continue the armed struggle. The result was a payment of Danegeld of 10,000 Roman pounds (3,300 kg) of silver (approx £1.8M at 2022 prices).

An account of the battle, embellished with many speeches attributed to the warriors and with other details, is related in an Old English poem which is usually named &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;. A modern embroidery created for the millennium celebration in 1991 and, in part, depicting the battle, can be seen at the Maeldune Centre in Maldon.

One manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; states that a certain Olaf, possibly the Norwegian Olaf Tryggvason, led the Viking forces, these estimated to have been between 2,000 and 4,000 fighting men. A source from the 12th-century , written by the monks at Ely, suggests that Byrhtnoth had only a few men to command: &quot;he was neither shaken by the small number of his men, nor fearful of the multitude of the enemy&quot;. Not all sources indicate such a disparity in numbers.

==The poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;==
&quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot; is the name conventionally given to a surviving 325-line fragment of Old English poetry. Linguistic study has led to the conjecture that initially the complete poem was transmitted orally, then in a lost manuscript in the East Saxon dialect and now survives as a fragment in the West Saxon form, possibly that of a scribe active at the Monastery of Worcester late in the 11th century. It is fortuitous that this was attached at an early date to a very notable manuscript, Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot;, which undoubtedly assisted in its survival. The manuscript, by now detached, was burned in the Cotton library fire at Ashburnham House in 1731. The keeper of the collection, John Elphinstone (or his assistant, David Casley), had transcribed the 325 lines of the poem in 1724, but the front and back pages were already missing from the manuscript (possibly around 50 lines each): an earlier catalogue described it as (&#x27;mutilated at head and heel&#x27;). As a result, vital clues about the purpose of the poem and perhaps its date have been lost.

At the time of battle, English royal policy of responding to Viking incursions was split. Some favoured paying off the Viking invaders with land and wealth, while others favoured fighting to the last man. The poem suggests that Byrhtnoth held this latter attitude, hence his moving speeches of patriotism.

The Vikings sailed up the Blackwater (then called the Panta), and Byrhtnoth called out his levy. The poem begins with him ordering his men to stand and to hold weapons. His troops, except for personal household guards, were local farmers and villagers of the Essex Fyrd militia. He ordered them to &quot;send steed away and stride forwards&quot;: they arrived on horses but fought on foot. The Vikings sailed up to a small island in the river. At low tide, the river leaves a land bridge from this island to the shore; the description seems to have matched the Northey Island causeway at that time. This would place the site of the battle about two miles southeast of Maldon. Olaf addressed the Saxons, promising to sail away if he was paid with gold and armour from the lord. Byrhtnoth replied, &quot;We will pay you with spear tips and sword blades.&quot;
With the ebb of the tide, Olaf&#x27;s forces began an assault across the small land bridge. Three Anglo-Saxon warriors, Wulfstan, Ælfhere and Maccus blocked the bridge, successfully engaging any Vikings who pressed forward (lines 72–83). The Viking commander requested that Byrhtnoth allow his troops onto the shore for formal battle. Byrhtnoth, (line 89b), let the enemy force cross to the mainland. Battle was joined, but an Englishman called Godrīc fled riding Byrhtnoth&#x27;s horse. Godrīc&#x27;s brothers Godwine and Godwīg followed him. Then many English fled, recognizing the horse and thinking that its rider was Byrhtnoth fleeing. To add insult to injury, it is stated that Godric had often been given horses by Byrhtnoth, a detail that, especially during the time period, would have had Godric marked as a coward and a traitor, something that could have easily been described as worse than death. The Vikings overcame the Saxons after losing many men, killing Byrhtnoth. After the battle Byrhtnoth&#x27;s body was found with its head missing, but his gold-hilted sword was still with his body.

There is some discussion about the meaning of &quot;&quot;. Although literally meaning &quot;over-heart&quot; or &quot;having too much heart&quot;, it could mean either &quot;pride&quot; or &quot;excess of courage&quot; (compare the Danish or German , which mean both &quot;hubris&quot; and &quot;recklessness&quot;). One argument is that the poem was written to celebrate Byrhtnoth&#x27;s actions and goad others into heroic action, and Byrhtnoth&#x27;s action stands proudly in a long tradition of heroic literature. Another viewpoint, most notably held by J. R. R. Tolkien, is that the poem is an elegy on a terrible loss and that the monastic author pinpoints the cause of the defeat in the commander&#x27;s sin of pride, a viewpoint bolstered by the fact that is, in every other attested instance, used to describe Satan&#x27;s pride. There is a memorial window, representing Byrhtnoth&#x27;s dying prayer, in St Mary&#x27;s church at Maldon.

It is believed by many scholars that the poem, while based upon actual events and people, was created to be less of a historical account and more of a means of enshrining and lifting up the memories of the men who fought and lost their lives on the battlefield protecting their homeland, especially in the case of the English commander of the battle, Byrhtnoth. He (Byrhtnoth) seems to embody many of the virtues that are uplifted in the Anglo-Saxon world, and is compared often by many scholars to the character Beowulf.

Norse invaders and Norse raiders differed in purpose. The forces engaged by the Anglo-Saxon were raiding, or (in Old Norse) &quot;&quot;, to gather loot, rather than to occupy land for settlement. Therefore, if Byrhtnoth&#x27;s forces had kept the Vikings off by guarding the causeway or by paying them off, Olaf would likely have sailed farther up the river or along the coast, and raided elsewhere. As a man with troops and weapons, it might be that Byrhtnoth had to allow the Vikings ashore to protect others. The poem may, therefore, represent the work of what has been termed the &quot;monastic party&quot; in Ethelred&#x27;s court, which advocated a military response, rather than tribute, to all Norse attacks.

==Other sources==

The death of Byrhtnoth, an ealdorman of Essex, was recorded in four versions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Its Cotton Tiberius manuscript (Version B) says for the year 991:

&quot;The Life of Oswald&quot;, written in Ramsey around the same time as the battle, portrays Byrhtnoth as a great religious warrior, with references to Biblical prophetic era figures.

In 1170, the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot; retold and embroidered the story and made the battle two fights, with the second being a fortnight long against overwhelming odds. These texts show, to some degree, the growth of a local hero cultus.

===Chronology===
The Winchester (or Parker) version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (Version A), has the most detailed account of the battle, but places it under the heading for the year 993. As all the other versions of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; place it in 991, this is believed to be either a transcription error, or because the battle was inserted later when its importance had become apparent. The widely accepted precise date is taken from notices for the death of Byrhtnoth in three abbey calendars; those of Ely, Winchester and Ramsey. The date in the Ely calendar is 10 August, whereas Winchester and Ramsey give 11 August. However, Byrhtnoth&#x27;s close connections with Ely imply that 10 August is more likely to be the accurate date.

===Topography===

It is clear from the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicles&quot; that Maldon in Essex is the site of the battle, because of its proximity to Ipswich and because Byrhtnoth was an Ealdorman of Essex. More precise details come from &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot; narrative, which describes how the Vikings established themselves on an island, separated from the mainland by a tidal inlet which could be crossed by a &quot;bridge&quot; or &quot;ford&quot; at low tide. The poem describes how the Vikings and Saxons negotiated by calling across the water while waiting for the tide to go out. Northey Island seems to fit this description. An investigation in 1973 suggested that the channel between Northey Island and the mainland would have been about 120 yards (110 metres) rather than 240 yards (220 metres) today. The causeway which crosses the channel today may not have existed in its present form in the 10th century, but there was certainly some form of crossing present. Other sites have been suggested, one being Osea Island which can be reached by a causeway, but is too far from the mainland to shout across. A bridge a mile inland from Maldon, now called Heybridge, has also been suggested, but the river is not tidal at that point.

==Manuscript sources==
In the Cotton library, the &quot;Battle of Maldon&quot; text had been in Otho A xii. The Elphinstone transcription is in the Bodleian Library, where it is pp. 7–12 of MS Rawlinson B. 203.

<doc id="60422" wikidata="Q595320" url="?curid=60422" title="Battle of Badon">
<text>The Battle of Badon, also known as the Battle of Mons Badonicus, was purportedly fought between Britons and Anglo-Saxons in Post-Roman Britain during the late 5th or early 6th century. It was credited as a major victory for the Britons, stopping the westward encroachment of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms for a period.

The earliest known references to the battle, by the British cleric Gildas, date to the 6th century. It is chiefly known today for the supposed involvement of the man who would later be remembered as the legendary King Arthur; although it is not agreed that Arthur was a historical person, his name first appears in the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, where he is mentioned as having participated in the battle alongside the Brittonic kings as a war commander, though is not described as a king himself. Because of the limited number of sources, there is no certainty about the date, location, or details of the fighting.

Almost all scholars agree that this battle did take place. Gildas, who wrote within living memory of the battle, does not mention Arthur or the names of other British leaders who took part. He also omits the names of the Saxon leaders. Gildas also does not describe it as an actual open battle, but rather as a siege. It remains unclear whether the Saxons were besieging the Britons or the Britons were besieging the Saxons.

==Historical accounts==
===Gildas===
The earliest mention of the Battle of Badon appears in Gildas&#x27; &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; (&quot;On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain&quot;), written in the early to mid-6th century. In it, the Anglo-Saxons are said to have &quot;dipped [their] red and savage tongue in the western ocean&quot; before Ambrosius Aurelianus organized a British resistance with the survivors of the initial Saxon onslaught. Gildas describes the period that followed Ambrosius&#x27; initial success:

&quot;De Excidio Britanniae&quot; describes the battle as such an &quot;unexpected recovery of the [island]&quot; that it caused kings, nobles, priests, and commoners to &quot;live orderly according to their several vocations.&quot; Afterwards, the long peace degenerated into civil wars and the iniquity of Maelgwn Gwynedd.

That Arthur had gone unmentioned by Gildas, ostensibly the source closest to his own time, was noticed at least as early as a 12th-century hagiography of Gildas which claims that Gildas had praised Arthur extensively but then excised him completely after Arthur killed the saint&#x27;s brother, Hueil mab Caw. Modern writers have suggested the details of the battle may have been so well known that Gildas expected his audience to be familiar with them.

===Bede===
The battle is next mentioned in an 8th-century text of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; (&quot;Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum&quot;), which describes the &quot;siege of Mount Badon, when they made no small slaughter of those invaders,&quot; as occurring 44 years after the first Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. Since Bede places that arrival just before, during or just after the joint reign in Rome of Marcian and Valentinian III in AD 449456, he must have considered Badon to have taken place between 493 and 500. Bede then puts off discussion of the battle &quot;But more of this hereafter&quot; only to seemingly never return to it.

Bede does later include an extended account of Saint Germanus of Auxerre&#x27;s victory over the Saxons and Picts in a mountain valley (traditionally placed at Mold in Flintshire in northeast Wales), which he credits with curbing the threat of invasion for a generation. However, as the victory is described as having been accomplished bloodlessly, it was presumably a different occasion from Badon. Accepted at face value, Saint Germanus&#x27; involvement would also place the battle around AD 430, although Bede&#x27;s chronology shows no knowledge of this.

===Nennius and the Welsh Annals===
The earliest surviving text specifically mentioning Arthur in connection with the battle is the early 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (&quot;The History of the Britons&quot;), attributed to the Welsh monk Nennius, in which the soldier (Latin &quot;mīles&quot;) Arthur is identified as the leader of the victorious British force at Badon:

The Battle of Badon is next mentioned in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; (&quot;Annals of Wales&quot;), assumed to have been written during the mid- to late-10th century. The entry states:

===Geoffrey of Monmouth===
Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s c. 1136 &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot;) was massively popular and survives in many copies from soon after its composition. Going into (and fabricating) much greater detail, Geoffrey closely identifies Badon with Bath, including having Merlin foretell that Badon&#x27;s baths would lose their hot water and turn poisonous. He also mixes in aspects of other accounts: the battle begins as a Saxon siege and then becomes a normal engagement once Arthur&#x27;s men arrive; Arthur bears the image of the Virgin both on his shield and shoulder. Arthur charges and kills 470, ten more than the number of Britons ambushed by Hengist near Salisbury.

Elements of the Welsh legends are added: in addition to the shield &quot;Pridwen&quot;, Arthur gains his sword, &quot;Caliburnus&quot; (Excalibur), and his spear, &quot;Ron&quot;. Geoffrey also makes the defence of the city from the Saxon sneak attack a holy cause, having Dubricius offer absolution of all sins for those who fall in battle.

==Scholarship==
There is considerable scholarly debate as to the exact date and location of the battle, though most agree that it took place in southern England sometime around the turn of the sixth century.

===Date===
Dates proposed by scholars for the battle include 493, 501 and 516. Daniel McCarthy and Dáibhí Ó Cróinín have posited that Gildas&#x27; 44 years and one month is not a reference to the simple chronology but a position within the 84-year Easter cycle used for computus at the time by the Britons and the Irish church. The tables in question begin in January 438, which would place their revised date of the battle in February 482.

Andrew Breeze, in a 2020 book, argues that the Battle of Badon or &quot;Braydon, Wiltshire&quot; took place in 493, deducing that Gildas was writing &quot;De Excidio&quot; in 536, in the middle of the extreme weather events of 535–536, because he cited a &quot;certain thick mist and black night&quot; which &quot;sits upon the whole island&quot; of Britain, but not the subsequent famine in the year 537. Breeze concluded that Badon was fought &quot;(...) in southern Britain, was fought in 493 and had nothing to do with Arthur.&quot;

===Location===
Though academics have never reached any consensus, Mount Badon’s location has traditionally been sited in the hills around Bath, most notably at Bathampton Down. Tim and Annette Burkitt have proposed Caer Badden (; now Bath, Somerset), some 20 miles northeast of the Roman mines at Charterhouse, on the basis of the &quot;Welsh Annals&quot; as well as archaeological and toponymic evidence.

Susan Hirst, Geoffrey Ashe and Michael Wood argue for the site of Liddington Castle on the hill above Badbury (Old English: &quot;Baddan byrig&quot;) in Wiltshire. This site commands The Ridgeway, which connects the River Thames with the River Avon and River Severn beyond.

The similarly named Badbury Rings in Dorset have also been argued to be the location of the battle. David Cooper agrees that this is the most likely site and has provided the most comprehensive analysis of the battle available to date.

Andrew Breeze has argued that &quot;Badon&quot; must be etymologically Brittonic rather than English (thus eliminating Bath from consideration as its name is entirely Germanic), and that the toponym as given by Gildas (&quot;Badonici Montis&quot;) is a misprint of &quot;Bradonici Montis&quot;, based on known Celtic placenames in Wales and Cornwall. Breeze posits Ringsbury Camp near Braydon in Wiltshire as the site of the battle.

===Possible Saxon commander===
Some authors have speculated that Ælle of Sussex may have led the Saxon forces at this battle. Others reject the idea out of hand. In book 9 of his work &quot;Historia regum Britanniae&quot;, Geoffrey of Monmouth mentions a certain Cheldric as Saxon war leader who fought at Bath during the same period, so other scholars suggest that (due to similarities of names) Cerdic of Wessex was the Saxon leader during the battle.

==Second Badon==
The A Text of the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; includes the entry: &quot;The first celebration of Easter among the Saxons. The second battle of Badon. Morgan dies.&quot; The date for this action is given by Phillimore as AD 665, but the Saxons&#x27; first Easter is placed by the B Text in its entry 634 years after the birth of Christ and &quot;the second Badon&quot; is not mentioned.

==Romance depiction==
The 13th-century Vulgate Cycle, a French prose romance retelling of the Arthurian legend, replaced the Battle of Badon with the Battle of Clarence (spelling variants: &quot;Clarance&quot;, &quot;Clarans&quot;, &quot;Clarenche&quot;, &quot;Clarens&quot;). In the first round of fighting, a coalition of British kings is defeated by the Saxons (or the Saracens in some subsequent versions, including that by Thomas Malory). In the second phase, Arthur joins the battle and enemy forces are destroyed, driving invaders into the sea.

==Local lore==

Apart from the professional scholarship, various communities throughout Wales and England have their own traditions maintaining that their area was the site of the battle. These include (besides Badbury Rings and Bathampton Down), the mountain of Mynydd Baedan near Maesteg in South Wales, and Bowden Hill in Wiltshire.

==Modern depictions==
King Arthur leads the Knights of the Round Table into battle against the Saxons led by Hengist in the &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; comic strip series episodes 1430 (5 July 1964) and following. The battle is mentioned in the 1975 comedy film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; as one of the many questionable feats of Sir Robin, who in the film&#x27;s bardic narration is said to have &quot;personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill&quot;. The battle is featured prominently in 1997&#x27;s &quot;&quot; by Bernard Cornwell, in the book&#x27;s second part, &quot;Mynydd Baddon&quot;, in which the armies of Angle and Saxon kings Aelle and Cerdic, aided by Celtic traitors led by Lancelot, are defeated in an epic battle by an uneasy alliance of various British and Irish kingdoms. The author combines various medieval accounts of the battle, such as it beginning as an Anglo-Saxon siege of a hilltop (here initially desperately defended by Guinevere, who is depicted as a brilliant strategist and rallying figure) and having Arthur&#x27;s cavalry appear with the sign of the cross on their shields (here a requisite demanded by the Christian king Tewdric for him to also join the battle), to create a more grounded and realistic depiction than the ones from his medieval sources. The 2004 film &quot;King Arthur&quot; ends in a climactic battle scene occurring along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall as the mostly Romano-British forces of Arthur defeat those of the Saxon kings Cerdic and Cynric, at a heavy cost to Arthur.

<doc id="60424" wikidata="Q132406" url="?curid=60424" title="Hallucigenia">
<text>Hallucigenia is a genus of lobopodian known from Cambrian aged fossils in Burgess Shale-type deposits in Canada and China, and from isolated spines around the world. The generic name reflects the type species&#x27; unusual appearance and eccentric history of study; when it was erected as a genus, &quot;H. sparsa&quot; was reconstructed as an enigmatic animal upside down and back to front. Lobopodians are a grade of Paleozoic panarthropods from which the velvet worms, water bears, and arthropods arose.

==Description==
&quot;Hallucigenia&quot; is a long tubular animal with up to ten pairs of slender legs (lobopods). The first 2 or 3 leg pairs are slender and featureless, while the remaining 7 or 8 pairs each terminate with 1 or 2 claws. Above the trunk region are 7 pairs of rigid conical sclerites (spines) corresponding to the 3rd–9th leg pairs. The trunk is either featureless (&quot;H. sparsa&quot;) or divided by heteronomous annulations (&quot;H. fortis&quot; and &quot;H. hongmeia&quot;). The &quot;head&quot; and &quot;tail&quot; end of the animal are difficult to identify; one end extends some distance beyond the legs and often droops down as if to reach the substrate. Some specimens display traces of a simple gut.

Research in the mid-2010s clarified that the longer end is a head with anteroventral mouth and at least a pair of simple eyes. The shape of head differs between species – elongated in &quot;H. sparsa&quot;, rounded in &quot;H. fortis&quot;, while those of &quot;H. hongmeia&quot; remain unknown. At least in &quot;H. sparsa&quot;, the head possesses radial teeth and pharyngeal teeth within the front of the gut.

&quot;Hallucigenia&quot; spines are made up of one to four nested elements. The spine surface of &quot;H. sparsa&quot; is covered in an ornament of minute triangular &#x27;scales&#x27;, while the spine surface of &quot;Hallucigenia hongmeia&quot; is a net-like texture of microscopic circular openings, which can be interpreted as the remains of Papillae.

==History of study==
&quot;Hallucigenia sparsa&quot; was originally described by Charles Walcott as a species of the polychaete worm &quot;Canadia&quot;. In his 1977 redescription of the organism, Simon Conway Morris recognized the animal as something quite distinct, for which he proposed the name &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; because of the &quot;bizarre and dream-like appearance of the animal.&quot; No specimen was available that showed both rows of legs, so Conway Morris reconstructed the animal walking on its spines, with its single row of legs interpreted as tentacles on the animal&#x27;s back. A dark stain at one end of the animal was interpreted as a featureless head. Only the forward tentacles could easily reach to the &#x27;head&#x27;, meaning that a mouth on the head would have to be fed by passing food along the line of tentacles. Conway Morris suggested that a hollow tube within each of the tentacles might be a &quot;mouth&quot;. This raised questions, such as how it would walk on the stiff legs, but it was accepted (with reservations) as the best available interpretation.

An alternative interpretation considered &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; to be an appendage of a larger, unknown animal. There had been precedent for this, as &quot;Anomalocaris&quot; had been originally identified as three separate creatures before being identified as a single huge (for its time) to creature.

In 1991, Lars Ramskold and Hou Xianguang, working with additional specimens of a &quot;hallucigenid&quot;, &quot;Microdictyon&quot;, from the lower Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China, reinterpreted &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; as a lobopodian, a legged worm-like taxon which were still thought to be exclusively related to onychophoran (velvet worm) at that time. They inverted it, interpreting the tentacles, which they believe to be paired, as walking structures and the spines as protective. Further preparation of fossil specimens showed that the &#x27;second legs&#x27; were buried at an angle to the plane along which the rock had split, and could be revealed by removing the overlying sediment. Ramskold and Hou also believe that the blob-like &#x27;head&#x27; is actually a stain that appears in many specimens, not a preserved portion of the anatomy. This stain may be an artifact of decomposition.

==Affinity==
Since the revisions around 1990s, &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; is unquestionably a lobopodian panarthropod, although the relationship with other panarthropods remains controversial. &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; has long been interpreted as a stem-group onychophoran (velvet worms) – a position that has found support from multiple phylogenetic analysis. A key character demonstrating this affinity is the cone-in-cone construction of &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; claws, a feature shared only with modern onychophorans. On the other hand, some analysis rather support the position of &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; as a basal panarthropod outside of onychophoran stem-group. Under this scenario, the cone-in-cone structure shared between &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; and onychophorans represent panarthropod plesiomorphy. &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; also exhibits certain characters inherited from the ancestral ecdysozoan, but lost in the modern onychophorans – in particular its distinctive foregut armature.

Below is a cladogram for &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; according to Yang &quot;et al.&quot;, 2015:

==Diversity==
In 2002, Desmond Collins informally suggested that new &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; fossils from the Burgess Shale showed male and female forms, one with &quot;a rigid trunk, robust neck and a globular head&quot; and the other thinner, and with a small head.

Three species of &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; have been described. The first specimen, &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; &quot;sparsa&quot;, was discovered in Canada. Two other species, &quot;H. fortis&quot; and &quot;H. hongmeia&quot;, are represented by the Maotianshan Shales&#x27; fossils of Chengjiang.

==Distribution==
&quot;Hallucigenia&quot; was first described from the Burgess Shale in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. 109 specimens of &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 0.3% of the community. &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; also forms a minor component of Chinese lagerstätten. Isolated hallucigeniid spines, however, are widely distributed in a range of Cambrian deposits, preserved both as carbonaceous and mineralized fossils.

<text>Symbiogenesis (endosymbiotic theory, or serial endosymbiotic theory) is the leading evolutionary theory of the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic organisms. The theory holds that mitochondria, plastids such as chloroplasts, and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells are descended from formerly free-living prokaryotes (more closely related to the Bacteria than to the Archaea) taken one inside the other in endosymbiosis. Mitochondria appear to be phylogenetically related to Rickettsiales bacteria, while chloroplasts are thought to be related to cyanobacteria. 

The idea that chloroplasts were originally independent organisms that merged into a symbiotic relationship with other one-celled organisms dates back to the 19th century, when it was espoused by researchers such as Andreas Schimper. The endosymbiotic theory was articulated in 1905 and 1910 by the Russian botanist Konstantin Mereschkowski, and advanced and substantiated with microbiological evidence by Lynn Margulis in 1967. 

Among the many lines of evidence supporting symbiogenesis are that mitochondria and plastids contain their own chromosomes and reproduce by splitting in two, parallel but separate from the sexual reproduction of the rest of the cell; that the chromosomes of some mitochondria and plastids are single circular DNA molecules similar to the circular chromosomes of bacteria; that the transport proteins called porins are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts, and also bacterial cell membranes; and that cardiolipin is found only in the inner mitochondrial membrane and bacterial cell membranes.

The Russian botanist Konstantin Mereschkowski first outlined the theory of symbiogenesis (from Greek: σύν &quot;syn&quot; &quot;together&quot;, βίος &quot;bios&quot; &quot;life&quot;, and γένεσις &quot;genesis&quot; &quot;origin, birth&quot;) in his 1905 work, &quot;The nature and origins of chromatophores in the plant kingdom&quot;, and then elaborated it in his 1910 &quot;The Theory of Two Plasms as the Basis of Symbiogenesis, a New Study of the Origins of Organisms&quot;. Mereschkowski proposed that complex life-forms had originated by two episodes of symbiogenesis, the incorporation of symbiotic bacteria to form successively nuclei and chloroplasts. Mereschkowski knew of the work of botanist Andreas Schimper. In 1883, Schimper had observed that the division of chloroplasts in green plants closely resembled that of free-living cyanobacteria. Schimper had tentatively proposed (in a footnote) that green plants had arisen from a symbiotic union of two organisms. In 1918 the French scientist Paul Jules Portier published &quot;Les Symbiotes&quot;, in which he claimed that the mitochondria originated from a symbiosis process. Ivan Wallin advocated the idea of an endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria in the 1920s.
The Russian botanist Boris Kozo-Polyansky became the first to explain the theory in terms of Darwinian evolution. In his 1924 book &quot;A New Principle of Biology. Essay on the Theory of Symbiogenesis&quot;, he wrote, &quot;The theory of symbiogenesis is a theory of selection relying on the phenomenon of symbiosis.&quot;

These theories did not gain traction until more detailed electron-microscopic comparisons between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts were made, such as by Hans Ris in 1961 and 1962. These, combined with the discovery that plastids and mitochondria contain their own DNA, led to a resurrection of the idea of symbiogenesis in the 1960s.
Lynn Margulis advanced and substantiated the theory with microbiological evidence in a 1967 paper, &quot;On the origin of mitosing cells.&quot; In her 1981 work &quot;Symbiosis in Cell Evolution&quot; she argued that eukaryotic cells originated as communities of interacting entities, including endosymbiotic spirochaetes that developed into eukaryotic flagella and cilia. This last idea has not received much acceptance, because flagella lack DNA and do not show ultrastructural similarities to bacteria or to archaea (see also: Evolution of flagella and Prokaryotic cytoskeleton). According to Margulis and Dorion Sagan, &quot;Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking&quot; (i.e., by cooperation). Christian de Duve proposed that the peroxisomes may have been the first endosymbionts, allowing cells to withstand growing amounts of free molecular oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. However, it now appears that peroxisomes may be formed &quot;de novo&quot;, contradicting the idea that they have a symbiotic origin. The fundamental theory of symbiogenesis as the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts is now widely accepted.

==From endosymbionts to organelles==

Biologists usually distinguish organelles from endosymbionts – whole organisms living inside other organisms – by their reduced genome sizes. As an endosymbiont evolves into an organelle, most of its genes are transferred to the host cell genome. The host cell and organelle therefore need to develop a transport mechanism that enables the return of the protein products needed by the organelle but now manufactured by the cell. 

=== Free-living ancestors ===

Alphaproteobacteria were formerly thought to be the free-living organisms most closely related to mitochondria. Later research indicates that mitochondria are most closely related to Pelagibacterales bacteria, in particular, those in the SAR11 clade. 

Nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria are the free-living organisms most closely related to plastids.

Both cyanobacteria and alphaproteobacteria maintain a large (&gt;6Mb) genome encoding thousands of proteins. Plastids and mitochondria exhibit a dramatic reduction in genome size when compared with their bacterial relatives. Chloroplast genomes in photosynthetic organisms are normally 120–200kb encoding 20–200 proteins and mitochondrial genomes in humans are approximately 16kb and encode 37 genes, 13 of which are proteins. Using the example of the freshwater amoeboid, however, &quot;Paulinella chromatophora&quot;, which contains chromatophores found to be evolved from cyanobacteria, Keeling and Archibald argue that this is not the only possible criterion; another is that the host cell has assumed control of the regulation of the former endosymbiont&#x27;s division, thereby synchronizing it with the cell&#x27;s own division. Nowack and her colleagues gene sequenced the chromatophore (1.02Mb) and found that only 867 proteins were encoded by these photosynthetic cells. Comparisons with their closest free living cyanobacteria of the genus &quot;Synechococcus&quot; (having a genome size 3Mb, with 3300 genes) revealed that chromatophores had undergone a drastic genome shrinkage. Chromatophores contained genes that were accountable for photosynthesis but were deficient in genes that could carry out other biosynthetic functions; this observation suggests that these endosymbiotic cells are highly dependent on their hosts for their survival and growth mechanisms. Thus, these chromatophores were found to be non-functional for organelle-specific purposes when compared with mitochondria and plastids. This distinction could have promoted the early evolution of photosynthetic organelles.

The loss of genetic autonomy, that is, the loss of many genes from endosymbionts, occurred very early in evolutionary time. Taking into account the entire original endosymbiont genome, there are three main possible fates for genes over evolutionary time. The first is the loss of functionally redundant genes, in which genes that are already represented in the nucleus are eventually lost. The second is the transfer of genes to the nucleus, while the third is that genes remain in the organelle that was once an organism. The loss of autonomy and integration of the endosymbiont with its host can be primarily attributed to nuclear gene transfer. As organelle genomes have been greatly reduced over evolutionary time, nuclear genes have expanded and become more complex. As a result, many plastid and mitochondrial processes are driven by nuclear encoded gene products. In addition, many nuclear genes originating from endosymbionts have acquired novel functions unrelated to their organelles.

=== Gene transfer mechanisms ===

The mechanisms of gene transfer are not fully known; however, multiple hypotheses exist to explain this phenomenon. The possible mechanisms include the Complementary DNA (cDNA) hypothesis and the bulk flow hypothesis. 

The cDNA hypothesis involves the use of messenger RNA (mRNAs) to transport genes from organelles to the nucleus where they are converted to cDNA and incorporated into the genome. The cDNA hypothesis is based on studies of the genomes of flowering plants. Protein coding RNAs in mitochondria are spliced and edited using organelle-specific splice and editing sites. Nuclear copies of some mitochondrial genes, however, do not contain organelle-specific splice sites, suggesting a processed mRNA intermediate. The cDNA hypothesis has since been revised as edited mitochondrial cDNAs are unlikely to recombine with the nuclear genome and are more likely to recombine with their native mitochondrial genome. If the edited mitochondrial sequence recombines with the mitochondrial genome, mitochondrial splice sites would no longer exist in the mitochondrial genome. Any subsequent nuclear gene transfer would therefore also lack mitochondrial splice sites.

The bulk flow hypothesis is the alternative to the cDNA hypothesis, stating that escaped DNA, rather than mRNA, is the mechanism of gene transfer. According to this hypothesis, disturbances to organelles, including autophagy (normal cell destruction), gametogenesis (the formation of gametes), and cell stress release DNA which is imported into the nucleus and incorporated into the nuclear DNA using non-homologous end joining (repair of double stranded breaks). For example, in the initial stages of endosymbiosis, due to a lack of major gene transfer, the host cell had little to no control over the endosymbiont. The endosymbiont underwent cell division independently of the host cell, resulting in many &quot;copies&quot; of the endosymbiont within the host cell. Some of the endosymbionts lysed (burst), and high levels of DNA were incorporated into the nucleus. A similar mechanism is thought to occur in tobacco plants, which show a high rate of gene transfer and whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts. In addition, the bulk flow hypothesis is also supported by the presence of non-random clusters of organelle genes, suggesting the simultaneous movement of multiple genes.

Ford Doolittle proposed that (whatever the mechanism) gene transfer behaves like a ratchet, resulting in unidirectional transfer of genes from the organelle to the nuclear genome. When genetic material from an organelle is incorporated into the nuclear genome, either the organelle or nuclear copy of the gene may be lost from the population. If the organelle copy is lost and this is fixed, or lost through genetic drift, a gene is successfully transferred to the nucleus. If the nuclear copy is lost, horizontal gene transfer can occur again, and the cell can &#x27;try again&#x27; to have successful transfer of genes to the nucleus. In this ratchet-like way, genes from an organelle would be expected to accumulate in the nuclear genome over evolutionary time.

== Endosymbiosis of protomitochondria ==

Endosymbiotic theory for the origin of mitochondria suggests that the proto-eukaryote engulfed a protomitochondrion, and this endosymbiont became an organelle, a major step in eukaryogenesis, the creation of the eukaryotes.

=== Mitochondria ===

Mitochondria are organelles that synthesize the energy-carrying molecule ATP for the cell by metabolizing carbon-based macromolecules. The presence of DNA in mitochondria and proteins, derived from mtDNA, suggest that this organelle may have been a prokaryote prior to its integration into the proto-eukaryote. Mitochondria are regarded as organelles rather than endosymbionts because mitochondria and the host cells share some parts of their genome, undergo division simultaneously, and provide each other with means to produce energy. The endomembrane system and nuclear membrane were hypothesized to have derived from the protomitochondria.

=== Nuclear membrane ===

The presence of a nucleus is one major difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Some conserved nuclear proteins between eukaryotes and prokaryotes suggest that these two types had a common ancestor. Another theory behind nucleation is that early nuclear membrane proteins caused the cell membrane to fold and form a sphere with pores like the nuclear envelope.
As a way of forming a nuclear membrane, endosymbiosis could be expected to use less energy than if the cell was to develop a metabolic process to fold the cell membrane for the purpose. Digesting engulfed cells without energy-producing mitochondria would have been challenging for the host cell. On this view, membrane-bound bubbles or vesicles leaving the protomitochondria may have formed the nuclear envelope.

The process of symbiogenesis by which the early eukaryotic cell integrated the proto-mitochondrion likely included protection of the archaeal host genome from the release of reactive oxygen species. These would have been formed during oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production by the proto-mitochondrion. The nuclear membrane may have evolved as an adaptive innovation for protecting against nuclear genome DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species. Substantial transfer of genes from the ancestral proto-mitochondrial genome to the nuclear genome likely occurred during early eukaryotic evolution. The greater protection of the nuclear genome against reactive oxygen species afforded by the nuclear membrane may explain the adaptive benefit of this gene transfer.

=== Endomembrane system ===

Modern eukaryotic cells use the endomembrane system to transport products and wastes in, within, and out of cells. The membrane of nuclear envelope and endomembrane vesicles are composed of similar membrane proteins. These vesicles also share similar membrane proteins with the organelle they originated from or are traveling towards. This suggests that what formed the nuclear membrane also formed the endomembrane system. Prokaryotes do not have a complex internal membrane network like eukaryotes, but they could produce extracellular vesicles from their outer membrane. After the early prokaryote was consumed by a proto-eukaryote, the prokaryote would have continued to produce vesicles that accumulated within the cell. Interaction of internal components of vesicles may have led to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, both being parts of the endomembrane system.

=== Cytoplasm ===

The syntrophy hypothesis, proposed by López-García and Moreira around the year 2000, suggested that eukaryotes arose by combining the metabolic capabilities of an archaean, a fermenting deltaproteobacterium, and a methanotrophic alphaproteobacterium which became the mitochondrion. In 2020, the same team updated their syntrophy proposal to cover an Promethearchaeati archaean that produced hydrogen with deltaproteobacterium that oxidised sulphur. A third organism, an alphaproteobacterium able to respire both aerobically and anaerobically, and to oxidise sulphur, developed into the mitochondrion; it may possibly also have been able to photosynthesise.

=== Date ===

The question of when the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic form occurred and when the first crown group eukaryotes appeared on earth is unresolved. The oldest known body fossils that can be positively assigned to the Eukaryota are acanthomorphic acritarchs from the 1.631 Gya Deonar Formation of India. These fossils can still be identified as derived post-nuclear eukaryotes with a sophisticated, morphology-generating cytoskeleton sustained by mitochondria. This fossil evidence indicates that endosymbiotic acquisition of alphaproteobacteria must have occurred before 1.6 Gya. Molecular clocks have also been used to estimate the last eukaryotic common ancestor, however these methods have large inherent uncertainty and give a wide range of dates. Reasonable results include the estimate of c. 1.8 Gya. A 2.3 Gya estimate also seems reasonable, and has the added attraction of coinciding with one of the most pronounced biogeochemical perturbations in Earth history, the early Palaeoproterozoic Great Oxygenation Event. The marked increase in atmospheric oxygen concentrations at that time has been suggested as a contributing cause of eukaryogenesis, inducing the evolution of oxygen-detoxifying mitochondria. Alternatively, the Great Oxidation Event might be a consequence of eukaryogenesis, and its impact on the export and burial of organic carbon.

== Organellar genomes ==

=== Plastomes and mitogenomes ===

Some endosymbiont genes remain in the organelles. Plastids and mitochondria retain genes encoding rRNAs, tRNAs, proteins involved in redox reactions, and proteins required for transcription, translation, and replication. There are many hypotheses to explain why organelles retain a small portion of their genome; however no one hypothesis will apply to all organisms, and the topic is still quite controversial. The hydrophobicity hypothesis states that highly hydrophobic (water hating) proteins (such as the membrane bound proteins involved in redox reactions) are not easily transported through the cytosol and therefore these proteins must be encoded in their respective organelles. The code disparity hypothesis states that the limit on transfer is due to differing genetic codes and RNA editing between the organelle and the nucleus. The redox control hypothesis states that genes encoding redox reaction proteins are retained in order to effectively couple the need for repair and the synthesis of these proteins. For example, if one of the photosystems is lost from the plastid, the intermediate electron carriers may lose or gain too many electrons, signalling the need for repair of a photosystem. The time delay involved in signalling the nucleus and transporting a cytosolic protein to the organelle results in the production of damaging reactive oxygen species. The final hypothesis states that the assembly of membrane proteins, particularly those involved in redox reactions, requires coordinated synthesis and assembly of subunits; however, translation and protein transport coordination is more difficult to control in the cytoplasm.

=== Non-photosynthetic plastid genomes ===

The majority of the genes in the mitochondria and plastids are related to the expression (transcription, translation and replication) of genes encoding proteins involved in either photosynthesis (in plastids) or cellular respiration (in mitochondria). One might predict that the loss of photosynthesis or cellular respiration would allow for the complete loss of the plastid genome or the mitochondrial genome respectively. While there are numerous examples of mitochondrial descendants (mitosomes and hydrogenosomes) that have lost their entire organellar genome, non-photosynthetic plastids tend to retain a small genome. There are two main hypotheses to explain this occurrence:

The essential tRNA hypothesis notes that there have been no documented functional plastid-to-nucleus gene transfers of genes encoding RNA products (tRNAs and rRNAs). As a result, plastids must make their own functional RNAs or import nuclear counterparts. The genes encoding tRNA-Glu and tRNA-fmet, however, appear to be indispensable. The plastid is responsible for haem biosynthesis, which requires plastid encoded tRNA-Glu (from the gene trnE) as a precursor molecule. Like other genes encoding RNAs, trnE cannot be transferred to the nucleus. In addition, it is unlikely trnE could be replaced by a cytosolic tRNA-Glu as trnE is highly conserved; single base changes in trnE have resulted in the loss of haem synthesis. The gene for tRNA-formylmethionine (tRNA-fmet) is also encoded in the plastid genome and is required for translation initiation in both plastids and mitochondria. A plastid is required to continue expressing the gene for tRNA-fmet so long as the mitochondrion is translating proteins.

The limited window hypothesis offers a more general explanation for the retention of genes in non-photosynthetic plastids. According to this hypothesis, genes are transferred to the nucleus following the disturbance of organelles. Disturbance was common in the early stages of endosymbiosis, however, once the host cell gained control of organelle division, eukaryotes could evolve to have only one plastid per cell. Having only one plastid severely limits gene transfer as the lysis of the single plastid would likely result in cell death. Consistent with this hypothesis, organisms with multiple plastids show an 80-fold increase in plastid-to-nucleus gene transfer compared with organisms with single plastids.

== Evidence ==

There are many lines of evidence that mitochondria and plastids including chloroplasts arose from bacteria.

* New mitochondria and plastids are formed only through binary fission, the form of cell division used by bacteria and archaea.
* If a cell&#x27;s mitochondria or chloroplasts are removed, the cell does not have the means to create new ones. In some algae, such as &quot;Euglena&quot;, the plastids can be destroyed by certain chemicals or prolonged absence of light without otherwise affecting the cell: the plastids do not regenerate.
* Transport proteins called porins are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts and are also found in bacterial cell membranes.
* A membrane lipid cardiolipin is exclusively found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and bacterial cell membranes.
* Some mitochondria and some plastids contain single circular DNA molecules that are similar to the DNA of bacteria both in size and structure.
* Genome comparisons suggest a close relationship between mitochondria and Alphaproteobacteria.
* Genome comparisons suggest a close relationship between plastids and cyanobacteria.
* Many genes in the genomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts have been lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host cell. Consequently, the chromosomes of many eukaryotes contain genes that originated from the genomes of mitochondria and plastids.
* Mitochondria and plastids contain their own ribosomes; these are more similar to those of bacteria (70S) than those of eukaryotes.
* Proteins created by mitochondria and chloroplasts use N-formylmethionine as the initiating amino acid, as do proteins created by bacteria but not proteins created by eukaryotic nuclear genes or archaea.

== Secondary endosymbiosis ==

Primary endosymbiosis involves the engulfment of a cell by another free living organism. Secondary endosymbiosis occurs when the product of primary endosymbiosis is itself engulfed and retained by another free living eukaryote. Secondary endosymbiosis has occurred several times and has given rise to extremely diverse groups of algae and other eukaryotes. Some organisms can take opportunistic advantage of a similar process, where they engulf an alga and use the products of its photosynthesis, but once the prey item dies (or is lost) the host returns to a free living state. Obligate secondary endosymbionts become dependent on their organelles and are unable to survive in their absence. A secondary endosymbiosis event involving an ancestral red alga and a heterotrophic eukaryote resulted in the evolution and diversification of several other photosynthetic lineages including Cryptophyta, Haptophyta, Stramenopiles (or Heterokontophyta), and Alveolata. 

A possible secondary endosymbiosis has been observed in process in the heterotrophic protist &quot;Hatena&quot;. This organism behaves like a predator until it ingests a green alga, which loses its flagella and cytoskeleton but continues to live as a symbiont. &quot;Hatena&quot; meanwhile, now a host, switches to photosynthetic nutrition, gains the ability to move towards light, and loses its feeding apparatus.

Despite the diversity of organisms containing plastids, the morphology, biochemistry, genomic organisation, and molecular phylogeny of plastid RNAs and proteins suggest a single origin of all extant plastids – although this theory was still being debated in 2008.

== Nitroplasts ==

A unicellular marine alga, &quot;Braarudosphaera bigelowii&quot; (a coccolithophore, which is a eukaryote), has been found with a cyanobacterium as an endosymbiont. The cyanobacterium forms a nitrogen-fixing structure, dubbed the nitroplast. It divides evenly when the host cell undergoes mitosis, and many of its proteins derive from the host alga, implying that the endosymbiont has proceeded far along the path towards becoming an organelle. The cyanobacterium is named &quot;Candidatus&quot; Atelocyanobacterium thalassa, and is abbreviated UCYN-A. The alga is the first eukaryote known to have the ability to fix nitrogen.

<text>Archie is a tool for indexing FTP archives, allowing users to more easily identify specific files. It is considered the first Internet search engine. The original implementation was written in 1990 by Alan Emtage, then a postgraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
Archie was superseded by other, more sophisticated search engines, including Jughead and Veronica, which were search engines for the Gopher protocol. These were in turn superseded by search engines like Yahoo! in 1995 and Google in 1998. Work on Archie ceased in the late 1990s. A legacy Archie server was maintained for historic purposes in Poland at Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling in the University of Warsaw until 2023.

With assistance from the University of Warsaw, a new Archie server was created and opened for public access at The Serial Port, a web-based computer museum, on 11 May 2024.

==Origin ==
Archie first appeared in 1986, while Emtage was the systems manager at the McGill University School of Computer Science. His predecessor had attempted to persuade the institution to connect to the Internet, but due to the expensive cost — roughly $35,000 per year for a sluggish link to Boston — it had been challenging to persuade the appropriate parties that the investment was worthwhile.

The name derives from the word &quot;archive&quot; without the &#x27;v&#x27;. Emtage has said that contrary to popular belief, there was no association with the Archie Comics. Despite this, other early Internet search technologies such as Jughead and Veronica were named after characters from the comics. Anarchie, one of the earliest graphical FTP clients, was named for its ability to perform Archie searches.

==Function==
The earliest versions of Archie would simply search a list of public anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites using the Telnet protocol and create index files available via FTP. To view the contents of a file, it had first to be downloaded. The indexes are updated on a regular basis (contacting each roughly once a month, so as not to waste too many resources of the remote servers) by requesting a listing. These listings were stored in local files to be searched using the Unix command.

The developers populated the engine&#x27;s servers with databases of anonymous FTP host directories. This was used to find specific file titles since the list was plugged in to a searchable database of FTP sites. Archie did not recognize natural language requests nor index the content inside the files. Therefore, users had to know the title of the file they wanted. The ability to index the content inside the files was later introduced by Gopher.

==Development ==
Emtage and Heelan wrote a script allowing people to log in and search collected information using the Telnet protocol at the host &quot;archie.mcgill.ca&quot; [132.206.2.3]. Later, more efficient front- and back-ends were developed, and the system spread from a local tool to a network-wide resource and a popular service available from multiple sites around the Internet. The collected data would be exchanged between the neighbouring Archie servers. The servers could be accessed in multiple ways: using a local client (such as &quot;archie&quot; or &quot;xarchie&quot;); telnetting to a server directly; sending queries by electronic mail; and later via a World Wide Web interface. At the peak of its popularity, the Archie search engine accounted for 50% of Montreal Internet traffic.

In 1992, Emtage, along with J. Peter Deutsch and some financial help from McGill University, formed Bunyip Information Systems with a licensed commercial version of the Archie search engine used by millions of people worldwide. Heelan followed them into Bunyip soon after, where he together with Bibi Ali and Sandro Mazzucato significantly updated the Archie database and indexed web pages. Work on the search engine ceased in the late 1990s, and the company dissolved in 2003.

<text>Archie Comic Publications, Inc. (often referred to simply as Archie Comics), is an American comic book publisher headquartered in the village of Pelham, New York. The company&#x27;s many titles feature the fictional teenagers Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Reggie Mantle, Sabrina Spellman, Josie and the Pussycats and Katy Keene. The company is also known for its long-running &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic series, which it published from 1992 until 2017.

The company began in 1939 as M.L.J. Magazines, Inc., which primarily published superhero comics. The initial Archie characters were created in 1941 by publisher John L. Goldwater and artist Bob Montana, in collaboration with writer Vic Bloom. They first appeared in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 (cover-dated Dec. 1941). With the creation of Archie, publisher John Goldwater hoped to appeal to fans of the Andy Hardy films starring Mickey Rooney.

&quot;Archie Comics&quot; was also the title of the company&#x27;s longest-running publication, the first issue appearing with a cover date of Winter 1942. Starting with issue #70, the title was shortened to simply &quot;Archie.&quot; The flagship series was relaunched from issue #1 in July 2015 with a new look and design suited for a new generation of readers, although after #32 it reverted to its historic numbering with #699. Archie Comics characters and concepts have also appeared in numerous films, television programs, cartoons, and video games.

==History==

===Independent era===

====M.L.J. Magazines====

=====1939–1946: early years=====

Maurice Coyne, Louis Silberkleit, and John L. Goldwater formed M.L.J. Magazines, Inc., and started publishing in September 1939. The company name was derived from the initials of the partners&#x27; first names.

Coyne served as M.L.J.&#x27;s bookkeeper and CFO. Coyne and Silberkleit had been partners in Columbia Publications, a pulp company that published its last issue in 1960. Silberkleit had a college degree from St. John&#x27;s University, was a licensed and registered pharmacist, and had a law degree from New York Law School. His efforts were focused on the business, printing, separating, distribution and financial ends of the company. John Goldwater served as editor-in-chief. Goldwater was one of the founders of the Comics Magazine Association of America, and he served as its president for 25 years. (The Comics Magazine Association of America is best known to comic fans for its Comics Code Authority.) Goldwater was also a national commissioner of the Anti-Defamation League.

M.L.J.&#x27;s first comic book, published in September 1939 (with a November cover date), was &quot;Blue Ribbon Comics&quot; with the first half full color and the last half in red and white tints. The first issue featured Rang-a-Tang the Wonder Dog. In November 1939 (with a January 1940 cover date), &quot;Pep Comics&quot; debuted with the Shield, the first US patriotic comic book hero, created by writer and managing editor Harry Shorten and designed by artist Irv Novick. &quot;Top Notch Comics&quot; was launched in December 1941. Until March 1944, the cover feature of &quot;Pep&quot; was the Shield when Archie took over the cover. The Shield was a forerunner for Joe Simon&#x27;s and Jack Kirby&#x27;s Captain America, being published 13 months earlier.

====Archie Comics====

=====1946–1990s=====
The Andy Hardy movies were an inspiration for Goldwater to have a comic book about a relatable normal person. Teenaged Archibald &quot;Chick&quot; Andrews debuted with Betty Cooper and Jughead Jones in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 (Dec. 1941), in a story by writer Vic Bloom and artist Bob Montana. Archie soon became M.L.J. Magazines&#x27; headliner, which led to the company changing its name to Archie Comic Publications in 1946. Siberkleit and Coyne discontinued Columbia Publications. In the late 1950s, Archie Publishing launched its &quot;Archie Adventure Series&quot; line with a new version of the Shield and two new characters.

The February 1962 issue of Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Help!&quot; magazine featured his parody of the Archie characters in its &quot;Goodman Beaver&quot; story, &quot;Goodman Goes Playboy&quot;, which was illustrated by frequent collaborator Will Elder. &quot;Help!&quot; publisher Jim Warren received a letter on December 6, 1961, accusing &quot;Help!&quot; of copyright infringement and demanding removal of the offending issue from newsstands. Warren was unable to recall the magazine, but he agreed to settle out of court rather than risk an expensive lawsuit. Warren paid Archie Comics $1,000, and ran a note of apology in a subsequent issue of &quot;Help!&quot; The story was reprinted in the book collection &quot;Executive Comic Book&quot; in 1962, with the artwork modified by Elder to obscure the appearance of the Archie characters. Archie Comics found their appearance still too close to its copyrighted properties, and threatened another lawsuit. Kurtzman and Elder settled out of court by handing over the copyright to the story. Archie Comics held onto the copyright and refused to allow the story to be republished. A request from Denis Kitchen in 1983 to include the story in his &quot;Goodman Beaver&quot; reprint collection was turned down. After &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; co-owner Gary Groth discovered that Archie Comics had allowed the copyright on &quot;Goodman Goes Playboy&quot; to expire, he had the story reprinted in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #262 (September 2004), and made it available as a PDF on the magazine&#x27;s website.

In the mid-1960s, during the period fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books, Archie switched its superheroes to a new imprint, &quot;Mighty Comics Group,&quot; with the MLJ heroes done in the campy humor of the Batman TV show. This imprint ended in 1967.

In the early 1970s, Archie Enterprises Inc. went public. Just over 10 years later, Louis Silberkleit&#x27;s son Michael and John Goldwater&#x27;s son Richard returned Archie Comic Publications to private ownership. Michael Silberkleit served as chairman and co-publisher, while Richard Goldwater served as president and co-publisher. Coyne retired in the 1970s as CFO.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Spire Christian Comics, a line of comic books by Fleming H. Revell, obtained license to feature the Archie characters in several of its titles, including &quot;Archie&#x27;s Sonshine,&quot; &quot;Archie&#x27;s Roller Coaster,&quot; &quot;Archie&#x27;s Family Album,&quot; and &quot;Archie&#x27;s Parables.&quot; These comics used Archie and his friends to tell stories with strong Christian themes and morals, sometimes incorporating Bible scripture. In at least one instance, the regular characters meet a Christ-like figure on the beach, and listen as he gently preaches Christian values.

Archie launched a short-lived fantasy and horror imprint, Red Circle Comics, in the 1970s. The company revived that imprint in the 1980s for its brief line of superhero comics. Later in the 1980s, Archie planned to publish superheroes again with the Spectrum Comics imprint, featuring a number of high-profile talents, but it cancelled this attempt before publishing a single issue.

Having licensed Archie&#x27;s MLJ Superheroes in 1991, DC Comics launched its imprint Impact Comics with these heroes.

In 1992, Archie partnered with Sega to create a four-part &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book miniseries based on the video game series of the same name. This was continued with a full series launch in 1993, which incorporated elements from the 1993 animated series by DiC Entertainment. The series ran for over 20 years, becoming the longest-running comic series based on a video game by 2008.

=====2000s=====
On April 4, 2003, Dad&#x27;s Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta was scheduled to debut a new play by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Fantasy,&quot; which depicted Riverdale&#x27;s most famous resident coming out of the closet and moving to New York. The day before the play was scheduled to open, Archie Comics issued a cease and desist order, threatening litigation if the play proceeded as written. Dad&#x27;s Garage artistic director Sean Daniels said, &quot;The play was to depict Archie and his pals from Riverdale growing up, coming out and facing censorship. Archie Comics thought if Archie was portrayed as being gay, that would dilute and tarnish his image.&quot; It opened a few days later as &quot;Weird Comic Book Fantasy&quot; with the character names changed. In 2014, Aguirre-Sacasa would become Archie&#x27;s Chief Creative Officer.

Bill Yoshida learned comic book lettering from Ben Oda and was hired in 1965 by Archie Comics, where he averaged 75 pages a week for 40 years for an approximate total of 156,000 pages.

Archie Comics sued music duo The Veronicas for trademark infringement in 2005 over the band&#x27;s name, which Archie Comics alleges was taken from the comic book character. Archie Comics and Sire Records (The Veronicas&#x27;s record label) reached a settlement involving co-promotion.

In 2007, Archie Comics launched a &quot;new look&quot; series of stories, featuring Archie characters drawn in an updated, less cartoony style similar to the characters&#x27; first appearance. There are a total of seven storylines and each one was published as a four-part storyline in a digest series. Also each &quot;new look&quot; story was based on a Riverdale High novel, a series of twelve novels; seven that are published, five that are not. They were published in the 1990s.

In 2008, Archie Publications once again licensed DC Comics its MLJ Super heroes for a DC Universe integrated line, Red Circle.

=====2010–present=====
Following Richard Goldwater&#x27;s death in 2007 and Michael Silberkleit&#x27;s in 2008, Silberkleit&#x27;s widow Nancy and Goldwater&#x27;s half-brother Jonathan became co-CEOs in 2009. Nancy Silberkleit, a former elementary-school art teacher, was given responsibility for scholastic and theater projects, and Jon Goldwater, a former rock/pop music manager, was responsible for running the company&#x27;s day-to-day publishing and entertainment efforts. The company sued Silberkleit in July 2011, and Goldwater filed another lawsuit against her in January 2012, alleging she was making bad business decisions and alienating staff; she in turn sued him for defamation. As of February 2012, New York Supreme Court Judge Shirley Kornreich, in Manhattan, had fined Silberkleit $500 for violating the court&#x27;s autumn order temporarily barring her from the company&#x27;s headquarters, and said the court might appoint a temporary receiver to protect the company&#x27;s assets. , these legal proceedings had been resolved.

Beginning in 2010, the company partnered with Random House Publisher Services for its bookstore distribution which included trade paperbacks, original graphic novels and additional book formats. Archie Comics saw its graphic novel and collected edition output increase from 11 book titles that year to 33 in 2012, and 40 in 2013. The company&#x27;s sales also increased by 410% for books and 1,000% for e-books since 2010.

Beginning in July 2010, the first issue of &quot;Life with Archie&quot; was launched. The series featured two different storylines exploring two possible futures — a world where Archie marries Betty and a world where he marries Veronica. The series also incorporated more contemporary themes including death, marriage woes, same-sex marriage, cancer, financial problems and gun control.

Kevin Keller, Archie Comics&#x27; first gay character, debuted in &quot;Veronica&quot; #202 in September 2010. The character was created out of a conversation between Goldwater and longtime Archie Comics writer-artist Dan Parent during the company&#x27;s first creative summit, about bringing more diversity to Riverdale. The issue sold out at the distributor level, prompting Archie Comics for the first time to issue a second edition of a comic. In June 2011, Keller was featured in his own four-part miniseries. A bimonthly Kevin Keller series launched with writer-artist Parent in early 2012 received a GLAAD award for Outstanding Comic Book the following year.

In March 2011, a copy of &quot;Archie Comics&quot; #1, first published in 1942, was sold at auction for $167,300, a record for a non-superhero comic book.

In April 2011, Archie Comics became the first mainstream comic-book publisher to make its entire line available digitally on the same day as the print release. At the New York Comic Con in October 2011, Archie Comics announced that its superheroes would return as an all-digital line under the Red Circle imprint, a subscription model with back-issue archive access. The imprint started in 2012 with a new &quot;New Crusaders&quot; series.

In October 2013, Archie Comics launched its first horror title, &quot;Afterlife with Archie,&quot; depicting Archie and the gang dealing with a zombie apocalypse that begins in their hometown of Riverdale. Written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and drawn by artist Francesco Francavilla, &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot; was also the first Archie Comics title to be sold exclusively to comic shops and to carry a rating of &quot;Teen+&quot;. The series adapted the Archie characters into a world with adult themes and horror tropes including zombies, the occult, demons, and Cthulhu.

The success of &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot; led to a second horror series, &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,&quot; which launched in October 2014 from Aguirre-Sacasa and artist Robert Hack. &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; takes place in the 1960s in the neighboring town of Greendale, and follows a 16-year-old Sabrina Spellman as she struggles to balance her responsibilities as a witch-in-training, with her feeling for her boyfriend, Harvey Kinkle.

On April 9, 2014, Archie Comics announced that the adult version of Archie Andrews featured in the &quot;Life with Archie&quot; series would die in issue #36 (July 2014), which would also be the second-to-last issue. Goldwater said Archie&#x27;s final fate would be the same in both of the possible parallel futures covered by the series. This version of Archie was killed saving Senator Kevin Keller from an assassination attempt.

In July 2014, Archie Comics announced that its superhero imprint Red Circle Comics would be rebranded as Dark Circle Comics in 2015. The new imprint focuses on self-contained stories featuring the superheroes from the Red Circle library while exploring the crime, horror, and adventure genres. The first wave included the superheroes the Black Hood, the Fox, and the Shield. Dark Circle Comics debuted with &quot;The Black Hood&quot; #1 (Feb. 2015) by writer Duane Swierczynski and artist Michael Gaydos in February 2015. The mature-readers title introduced policer officer Gregory Hettinger, the new Black Hood, who struggles with an addiction to painkillers as a result of a shooting outside a school in Philadelphia. The launch continued with &quot;The Fox&quot; (April 2015), picking up where Red Circle&#x27;s &quot;The Fox&quot; series had left. The series was co-written by Dean Haspiel and Mark Waid with art by Haspiel. &quot;The Shield&quot; #1 (Oct. 2015) from co-writers Chuck Wendig and Adam Christopher and artist Drew Johnson debuted a new, female Shield named Victoria Adams. &quot;The Hangman&quot; #1 (Nov. 2015) introduced a supernatural horror series from writer Frank Tieri and artist Felix Ruiz about mob hit-man Mike Minetta making a deal with the devil to become the new Hangman after the previous person to wear the mantle ascended to Heaven.

Archie Comics launched a $350,000 Kickstarter in May 2015 campaign to help the publisher get three additional series out to the public sooner than otherwise: &quot;Life with Kevin&quot;, focusing on Kevin Keller, and new &quot;Jughead&quot; and &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot; series. Five days later, Archie Comics cancelled the campaign after critical response. The company stated that the three titles would still be published at a later time.

In March 2015, Archie Comics announced that its two delayed horror series would return under a new imprint, Archie Horror, with &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; #2 and &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot; #8 being released in April and May.

In December 2014, Archie Comics announced that its flagship series &quot;Archie&quot; would relaunch with a new first issue in July 2015. The new series would be a modern take on the Archie characters by writer Mark Waid and artist Fiona Staples, featuring serialized storylines. After the first three issues, Annie Wu drew an issue, followed by new regular artist Veronica Fish. The new title received IGN&#x27;s &quot;Best New Comic Series of 2015&quot; award.

The first title in the company&#x27;s &quot;New Riverdale&quot; universe, &quot;Archie&quot; was released with a July 2015 cover date and came in at #7 for comic book sales for the month. The next title, &quot;Jughead&quot;, was released in October. In April 2015, Archie Comics announced &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot; which debuted in July 2016. Also announced was &quot;Life with Kevin&quot;, a digital-first mini-series that debuted in June 2016. &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; and &quot;Reggie and Me&quot; followed in September and December 2016.

Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, playwright, screenwriter and comic book writer, was appointed Archie Comics chief creative officer in March 2014. Archie characters landed a live-action TV series, &quot;Riverdale&quot;, at Fox with a script deal plus penalty in October 2014. Warner Bros Television and Berlanti Productions were producing. However, the show was not selected for broadcast until January 29, 2016, when it was picked up by the CW.

In February 2017, Marvel had licensed Archie Comics to publish Marvel Digests collections for the newsstand market starting in November 2017. With three TV series at various stages, Archie Comics expanded its film and television operations in February 2019 to a division, Archie Comics Studios, with the hire of two executives, Siobhan Bachman, senior vice-president of film and television, and Matthew Lottman, head of development &amp; production.

==Corporate affairs==
The company&#x27;s headquarters is in a property in the Sanborn Map Building in Pelham, New York. It was in a facility of Mamaroneck, New York, with warehouse facilities and of office space until May 2015, when it moved to its current location. Due to changes in the comics industry with digitization, the company needed more office space and less warehouse space.

According to the publisher, the official &quot;Archie&quot; website receives 40 million hits a month.

== Characters ==
=== Archie and Riverdale ===

&quot;Archie&quot; is set in the fictional small town of Riverdale.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; postulated that &quot;the cartoonist Bob Montana inked the original likenesses of Archie and his pals and plopped them in an idyllic Midwestern community named Riverdale because Mr. Goldwater, a New Yorker, had fond memories of time spent in Hiawatha, Kansas.&quot; However, others have noted resemblance between Riverdale and Haverhill, Massachusetts, where Bob Montana attended Haverhill High School.

=== Superheroes ===

Initially, MLJ started out publishing humor and adventure strips in anthology comic books as was the standard, but quickly added superheroes in their first title&#x27;s second issue, &quot;Blue Ribbon Comics&quot; #2, with Bob Phantom. In January 1940, &quot;Pep Comics&quot; debuted featuring the Shield, America&#x27;s first patriotic comic book hero, by writer and managing editor Harry Shorten and artist Irv Novick. MLJ&#x27;s Golden Age heroes also included the Black Hood, who also appeared in pulp magazines and a radio show; and the Wizard, who shared a title with the Shield.

Later revivals of the MLJ superheroes occurred under a number of imprints: Archie Adventure Series, Mighty Comics, Red Circle Comics and one aborted attempt, Spectrum Comics. Archies Publications then licensed them out to DC Comics in the 1990s for Impact Comics universe imprint then again in 2008 for a DC Universe integrated Red Circle line.

Archie&#x27;s Silver Age relaunch of its superheroes under the Archie Adventure Series imprint and then the Mighty Comics imprint began with a new version of the Shield and two new characters: the Jaguar and the Fly. In the mid-1960s with the Silver Age of Comics, Archie switched the heroes to a new imprint, &quot;Mighty Comics Group&quot;, with the revival of all the MLJ heroes done as Marvel parodies with &quot;the campy humor of the Batman TV show.&quot; This imprint shift soon brought the company its first super hero team book similar to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers with the Mighty Crusaders. This imprint ended in 1967.

With the conversion of Archie&#x27;s Red Circle Comics from horror to superheroes in the 1980s, the Mighty Crusaders, Black Hood, the Comet, the Fly and two versions of the Shield had their own titles.

Archie planned to publish superheroes again in the late 1980s with an imprint called Spectrum Comics, featuring a number of high-profile talents, including Steve Englehart, Jim Valentino, Marv Wolfman, Michael Bair, Kelley Jones, and Rob Liefeld. Planned Spectrum titles included &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;The Fox&quot;, &quot;Hangman&quot;, &quot;Jaguar&quot;, &quot;Mister Justice&quot;, and &quot;The Shield&quot;. Ultimately, Archie cancelled Spectrum Comics before publishing a single issue.

In 2012, Archie Comics relaunched its superhero imprint, Red Circle Comics, as an all-digital line under a subscription model with back issues archive access starting with New Crusader.

In 2015, Archie Comics rebranded its superhero imprint under the new title Dark Circle Comics. It was launched in February with The Black Hood followed by the launch of &quot;The Fox&quot; in April, while &quot;The Shield&quot; and &quot;The Hangman&quot; followed in September and November.

==Archie characters in other media==
===Television===

====Animation====
In 1968, CBS began airing episodes of &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, a cartoon series produced by Filmation. Although it lasted only for a single season, it aired in reruns for the next decade, and was followed by several spin-off programs, which used segments from this original Archie show and new material. In 1970, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch got her own animated series, also produced by Filmation. In 1970, another Archie property received the Saturday morning cartoon treatment: &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;. Unlike Archie and Sabrina, Josie&#x27;s show was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, the company behind such animated hits as &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, and &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?&quot;. The show was followed by a spin-off, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space,&quot; in 1972. &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, and several of the spin-off shows including &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; are currently available on DVD in complete-series boxed sets.

In 1974, Filmation produced &quot;The U.S. of Archie&quot;, in which the gang recreated several events from American history, which lasted 16 episodes.

In 1987, DIC Entertainment produced an NBC Saturday morning cartoon, &quot;The New Archies&quot;. This children&#x27;s television cartoon re-imagined the teenage students of Riverdale High School as pre-teens in junior high. Fourteen episodes of the show were produced, which aired during the show&#x27;s only season in 1987 and were repeated in 1989. A short-lived Archie Comics series was produced bearing the same title and set in the same universe as the animated series. Reruns of the series ran on The Family Channel&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup from 1991 to 1993, and on Toon Disney from 1998 to 2002. The cast was basically the same, but Dilton Doiley was replaced as the &quot;intellectual&quot; character by an African American named Eugene. Eugene&#x27;s girlfriend Amani was another addition to the cast. Archie also gained a dog named Red.

In 1999, another animated program featuring Archie and his friends was produced by DIC Entertainment. &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot; featured core Archie characters solving mysteries occurring in their hometown of Riverdale. The show ran on the PAX network for only a single 40-episode season, and continues to air sporadically in reruns on various other networks. The complete series was released on DVD in 2012. As a companion to the Archie series, DIC also produced &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sabrina&#x27;s Secret Life&quot; and &quot;&quot;; the cartoons featured Sabrina and her aunts at a younger age than they were in the comic books. Tie-in comic book titles were produced for all of these series.

In 2012, it was announced that MoonScoop would produce a new Sabrina the Teenage Witch series titled &quot;&quot;. It ran for a single 26-episode season on Hub Network from October 2013 until June 2014.

In 2013, MoonScoop announced that it would produce a new Archie animated series titled &quot;It&#x27;s Archie&quot;, featuring Archie and friends in junior high. The first season was set to feature 52 11-minute episodes, however the series never aired.

In 2021, a television series, titled &quot;Superhero Kindergarten&quot;, was produced by Genius Brands. The series is based on the comic series of the same name written by Stan Lee.

====Live action====

=====1976 special and &quot;Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again&quot;=====
In the mid-1970s, two live-action specials of Archie and the Archie characters were aired on U.S. television. &quot;Archie,&quot; which aired on December 19, 1976, was a one-hour pilot episode as part of the ABC Saturday Comedy Special, and &quot;The Archie Situation Comedy Musical Variety Show,&quot; a TV movie, which aired on August 5, 1978. Both specials featured the same actors cast in their respective roles. In 1990, NBC aired &quot;&quot; (titled &quot;Archie: Return to Riverdale&quot; on video), a TV movie featuring Christopher Rich as a 30-something Archie Andrews who returns to his hometown for a high school reunion, and reunites with Betty, Veronica, and several other original comic book characters.

=====&quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;=====

In 1996, cable network Showtime aired &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, a live-action TV movie starring Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina. The film served as the pilot for a TV series, also starring Hart, which began airing in the fall of 1996 on ABC. The sitcom was relatively faithful to the comic book series (despite major revisions to the character&#x27;s backstory that were later retconned into the comic books), and enjoyed a lengthy run until 2003. It is now available in its entirety on DVD, as is the original TV movie.

=====&quot;Riverdale&quot;=====

By October 2014, Greg Berlanti was developing a drama series for Fox titled &quot;Riverdale&quot; with Berlanti and Sarah Schechter as executive producers through Berlanti Productions, and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa writing the series. It would feature Archie, Betty, Veronica, Jughead, Cheryl, Toni, Sweetpea, Fangs, Reggie, Kevin, Josie &amp; the Pussycats, and all of the parents. In July 2015, the pilot was moved to The CW. In addition to the series offering a bold, subversive take on the gang, Aguirre-Sacasa has described &quot;Riverdale&quot; as &quot;Archie meets &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&quot;. The pilot was ordered by the network in January 2016 with filming set to begin in the spring. Archie is portrayed by actor KJ Apa.

=====&quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;=====

In September 2017, it was reported that a live-action television series was being developed for The CW by Warner Bros. Television and Berlanti Productions, with a planned release in the 2018–2019 television season. Based on the comic series, featuring the Archie Comics character Sabrina the Teenage Witch, the series would be a companion series to &quot;Riverdale&quot;. Lee Toland Krieger will direct the pilot, which will be written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. Both are executive producers along with Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and Jon Goldwater. In December 2017, the project had moved to Netflix under a yet-to-be-announced new title. Two seasons, comprising ten episodes each, have been ordered by the streaming service. Filming for first season will begin on March 19, 2018. It is expected to film back-to-back with the second season.

In January 2018, it was announced that Kiernan Shipka has signed on to play the lead role of Sabrina Spellman, and CW president Mark Pedowitz noted that, &quot;at the moment, there is no discussion about crossing over&quot; with &quot;Riverdale&quot;. Throughout February and mid-March 2018, the remaining starring cast members were cast, including Jaz Sinclair as Rosalind Walker, Michelle Gomez as Mary Wardell / Madam Satan, Chance Perdomo as Ambrose Spellman, Lucy Davis as Hilda Spellman, Miranda Otto as Zelda Spellman, Richard Coyle as Father Blackwood, Ross Lynch as Harvey Kinkle, and Tati Gabrielle as Prudence. Salem Saberhagen also appears in the series.

=====&quot;Katy Keene&quot;=====

In August 2018, Aguirre-Sacasa revealed that another &quot;Riverdale&quot; spin-off was in development at The CW. He said that the series would be &quot;very different from &quot;Riverdale&quot;&quot; and that it would be produced &quot;in [the 2018–19] development cycle.&quot; By January 2019, The CW issued a pilot order for the series stating that the plot will: &quot;[follow] the lives and loves of four iconic Archie Comics characters — including fashion legend-to-be Katy Keene — as they chase their twenty-something dreams in New York City. This musical dramedy chronicles the origins and struggles of four aspiring artists trying to make it on Broadway, on the runway and in the recording studio.&quot; In February of the same year, it was announced that Ashleigh Murray, who portrays Josie McCoy in &quot;Riverdale&quot;, had been cast in a lead role for &quot;Katy Keene&quot;, leading to her exit from the former. By August 2019, Michael Grassi announced that there is a crossover between &quot;Riverdale&quot; and &quot;Katy Keene&quot; being developed. The crossover episode aired on February 5, 2020.

===Film===
In 1994, a planned live-action &quot;Archie&quot; movie to be released by Universal Studios in 1995 was announced. In 1996, it was said that the script was being finalized and the film was scheduled for release in 1997. In 1997 it was still reported that Universal was developing the film&#x27;s script.

In 2001, Universal Studios and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, based on the comic of the same name.

In 2003, Miramax announced that they were working on a Betty and Veronica movie, but the project was cancelled.

In 2013, it was announced that Warner Bros. would produce a live-action &quot;Archie&quot; film, directed by Jason Moore and written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa.

An Indian feature film adaptation of &quot;The Archies&quot;, directed by Zoya Akhtar, was in production for Netflix, with release planned for late 2023.

===Broadway===
In 2015, Archie Comics announced that they would be bringing Archie, Betty, Veronica, Jughead and the rest of the Riverdale gang to Broadway with an all-new musical. Adam McKay is set to write the book for the show while Funny or Die will serve as a presenting partner. CEO Jon Goldwater and CCO Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa will oversee production. Triptyk Studios packaged the partnership and Tara Smith, B. Swibel and Adam Westbrook will oversee development of the musical for the company. At this time no creative team for the musical has been announced.

<text>A nuclear bunker buster, also known as an earth-penetrating weapon (EPW), is the nuclear equivalent of the conventional bunker buster. The non-nuclear component of the weapon is designed to penetrate soil, rock, or concrete to deliver a nuclear warhead to an underground target. These weapons would be used to destroy hardened, underground military bunkers or other below-ground facilities. An underground explosion releases a larger fraction of its energy into the ground, compared to a surface burst or air burst explosion at or above the surface, and so can destroy an underground target using a lower explosive yield. This in turn could lead to a reduced amount of radioactive fallout. However, it is unlikely that the explosion would be completely contained underground. As a result, significant amounts of rock and soil would be rendered radioactive and lofted as dust or vapor into the atmosphere, generating significant fallout.

== Base principle ==
While conventional bunker busters use several methods to penetrate concrete structures, these are for the purpose of destroying the structure directly, and are generally limited in how much of a bunker (or system of bunkers) they can destroy by depth and their relatively low explosive force (compared to nuclear weapons).

The primary difference between conventional and nuclear bunker busters is that, while the conventional version is meant for one target, the nuclear version can destroy an entire underground bunker system.

The main principles in modern bunker design are largely centered around survivability in nuclear war. As a result of this both American and Soviet sites reached a state of &quot;super hardening&quot;, involving defenses against the effects of a nuclear weapon such as spring- or counterweight-mounted (in the case of the R-36) control capsules and thick concrete walls ( for the Minuteman ICBM launch control capsule) heavily reinforced with rebar. These systems were designed to survive a near miss of 20 megatons.

Liquid-fueled missiles such as those historically used by Russia are more fragile and easily damaged than solid-fueled missiles such as those used by the United States. The complex fuel storage facilities and equipment needed to fuel missiles for launch and de-fuel them for frequent maintenance add additional weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Therefore, a similar degree of silo &quot;hardening&quot; does not automatically equate to a similar level of missile &quot;survivability&quot;.

Major advancements in the accuracy and precision of nuclear and conventional weapons subsequent to the invention of the missile silo itself have also rendered many &quot;hardening&quot; technologies useless. With modern weapons capable of striking within several feet of their intended targets, a modern &quot;near miss&quot; can be much more effective than a &quot;hit&quot; decades ago. A weapon need only cover the silo door with sufficient debris to prevent its immediate opening to render the missile inside useless for its intended mission of rapid strike or counter-strike deployment.

A nuclear bunker buster negates most of the countermeasures involved in the protection of underground bunkers by penetrating the defenses prior to detonating. A relatively low yield may be able to produce seismic forces beyond those of an air burst or even ground burst of a weapon with twice its yield. Additionally, the weapon has the ability to impart more severe horizontal shock waves than many bunker systems are designed to combat by detonating at or near the bunker&#x27;s depth, rather than above it.

Geologic factors also play a major role in weapon effectiveness and facility survivability. Locating facilities in hard rock may appear to reduce the effectiveness of bunker-buster type weapons by decreasing penetration, but the hard rock also transmits shock forces to a far higher degree than softer soil types. The difficulties of drilling into and constructing facilities within hard rock also increase construction time and expense, as well as making it more likely construction will be discovered and new sites targeted by foreign militaries.

== Methods of operation ==

=== Penetration by explosive force ===
Concrete structure design has not changed significantly in the last 70 years. The majority of protected concrete structures in the US military are derived from standards set forth in &quot;Fundamentals of Protective Design&quot;, published in 1946 (US Army Corps of Engineers). Various augmentations, such as glass, fibers, and rebar, have made concrete less vulnerable, but far from impenetrable.

When explosive force is applied to concrete, three major fracture regions are usually formed: the initial crater, a crushed aggregate surrounding the crater, and &quot;scabbing&quot; on the surface opposite the crater. Scabbing, also known as spalling, is the violent separation of a mass of material from the opposite face of a plate or slab subjected to an impact or impulsive loading, without necessarily requiring that the barrier itself be penetrated.

While soil is a less dense material, it also does not transmit shock waves as well as concrete. So while a penetrator may actually travel further through soil, its effect may be lessened due to its inability to transmit shock to the target.

=== Hardened penetrator ===

Further thinking on the subject envisions a hardened penetrator using kinetic energy to defeat the target&#x27;s defenses and subsequently deliver a nuclear explosive to the buried target.

The primary difficulty facing the designers of such a penetrator is the tremendous heat applied to the penetrator when striking the shielding at high speed. This has partially been solved by using metals such as tungsten (the metal with the highest melting point), and altering the shape of the projectile (such as an ogive).

Altering the shape of the projectile to incorporate an ogive shape has yielded substantial improvement in penetration ability. Rocket sled testing at Eglin Air Force Base has demonstrated penetrations of in concrete when traveling at . The reason for this is liquefaction of the concrete in the target, which tends to flow over the projectile. Variation in the speed of the penetrator can either cause it to be vaporized on impact (in the case of traveling too fast), or to not penetrate far enough (in the case of traveling too slowly). An approximation for the penetration depth is obtained with an impact depth formula derived by Sir Isaac Newton.

=== Combination penetrator-explosive munitions ===
Another school of thought on nuclear bunker busters is using a light penetrator to travel through shielding, and detonate a nuclear charge there. Such an explosion would generate powerful shock waves, which would be transmitted very effectively through the solid material comprising the shielding (see &quot;scabbing&quot; above).

== Policy and criticism of fallout ==
The main criticisms of nuclear bunker busters regard fallout and nuclear proliferation. The purpose of an earth-penetrating nuclear bunker buster is to reduce the required yield needed to ensure the destruction of the target by coupling the explosion to the ground, yielding a shock wave similar to an earthquake. For example, the United States retired the B-53 warhead, with a yield of nine megatons, because the B-61 Mod 11 could attack similar targets with much lower yield (400 kilotons), due to the latter&#x27;s superior ground penetration. By burying itself into the ground before detonation, a much higher proportion of the explosion energy is transferred to seismic shock when compared to the surface burst produced from the B-53&#x27;s laydown delivery. Moreover, the globally dispersed fallout of an underground B-61 Mod 11 would likely be less than that of a surface burst B-53. Supporters note that this is one of the reasons nuclear bunker busters should be developed. Critics claim that developing new nuclear weapons sends a proliferating message to non-nuclear powers, undermining non-proliferation efforts.

Critics also worry that the existence of lower-yield nuclear weapons for relatively limited tactical purposes will lower the threshold for their actual use, thus blurring the sharp line between conventional weapons intended for use and weapons of mass destruction intended only for hypothetical deterrence, and increasing the risk of escalation to higher-yield nuclear weapons.

Local fallout from any nuclear detonation is increased with proximity to the ground. While a megaton-class yield surface burst will inevitably throw up many tons of (newly) radioactive debris, which falls back to the earth as fallout, critics contend that despite their relatively minuscule explosive yield, nuclear bunker busters create more local fallout per kiloton yield. Also, because of the subsurface detonation, radioactive debris may contaminate the local groundwater.

The Union of Concerned Scientists advocacy group points out that at the Nevada Test Site, the depth required to contain fallout from an average-yield underground nuclear test was over , depending upon the weapon&#x27;s yield. They contend that it is improbable that penetrators could be made to burrow so deeply. With yields between 0.3 and 340 kilotons, they argue, it is unlikely the blast would be completely contained.

Critics further state that the testing of new nuclear weapons would be prohibited by the proposed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Although Congress refused to ratify the CTBT in 1999, and therefore this treaty has no legal force in the US, the US has adhered to the spirit of the treaty by maintaining a moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992.

Proponents, however, contend that lower explosive yield devices and subsurface bursts would produce little to no climatic effects in the event of a nuclear war, in contrast to multi-megaton air and surface bursts (that is, if the nuclear winter hypothesis proves accurate). Lower fuzing heights, which would result from partially buried warheads, would limit or completely obstruct the range of the burning thermal rays of a nuclear detonation, therefore limiting the target, and its surroundings, to a fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for subsurface bursts. Professors Altfeld and Cimbala have suggested that belief in the possibility of nuclear winter has actually made nuclear war more likely, contrary to the views of Carl Sagan and others, because it has inspired the development of more accurate, and lower explosive yield, nuclear weapons.

== Targets and the development of bunker busters ==

As early as 1944, the Barnes Wallis Tallboy bomb and subsequent Grand Slam weapons were designed to penetrate deeply fortified structures through sheer explosive power. These were not designed to directly penetrate defences, though they could do this (for example, the Valentin submarine pens had ferrous concrete roofs thick which were penetrated by two Grand Slams on 27 March 1945), but rather to penetrate under the target and explode leaving a camouflet (cavern) which would undermine foundations of structures above, causing it to collapse, thus negating any possible hardening. The destruction of targets such as the V3 battery at Mimoyecques was the first operational use of the Tallboy. One bored through a hillside and exploded in the Saumur rail tunnel about below, completely blocking it, and showing that these weapons could destroy any hardened or deeply excavated installation. Modern targeting techniques allied with multiple strikes could perform a similar task.

Development continued, with weapons such as the nuclear B61, and conventional thermobaric weapons and GBU-28. One of the more effective housings, the GBU-28 used its large mass () and casing (constructed from barrels of surplus 203 mm howitzers) to penetrate of concrete, and more than of earth. The B61 Mod 11, which first entered military service after the Cold war had ended, in January 1997, was specifically developed to allow for bunker penetration, and is speculated to have the ability to destroy hardened targets a few hundred feet beneath the earth.

While penetrations of were sufficient for some shallow targets, both the Soviet Union and the United States were creating bunkers buried under huge volumes of soil or reinforced concrete in order to withstand the multi-megaton thermonuclear weapons developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Bunker penetration weapons were initially designed within this Cold War context. One likely Soviet Union/Russian target, Mount Yamantau, was regarded in the 1990s by Maryland Republican congressman, Roscoe Bartlett, as capable of surviving &quot;half a dozen&quot; repeated nuclear strikes of an unspecified yield, one after the other in a &quot;direct hole&quot;.

The Russian continuity of government facility at Kosvinsky Mountain, finished in early 1996, was designed to resist US earth-penetrating warheads and serves a similar role as the American Cheyenne Mountain Complex. The timing of the Kosvinsky completion date is regarded as one explanation for US interest in a new nuclear bunker buster and the declaration of the deployment of the B-61 Mod 11 in 1997. Kosvinsky is protected by about of granite.

The weapon was revisited after the Cold War during the 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan, and again during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the campaign in Tora Bora in particular, the United States believed that &quot;vast underground complexes,&quot; deeply buried, were protecting opposing forces. Such complexes were not found. While a nuclear penetrator (the &quot;Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator&quot;, or &quot;RNEP&quot;) was never built, the US DOE was allotted budget to develop it, and tests were conducted by the US Air Force Research Laboratory. The RNEP was to use the 1.2 megaton B83 physics package.

The Bush administration removed its request for funding of the weapon in October 2005. Additionally, then US Senator Pete Domenici announced funding for the nuclear bunker-buster has been dropped from the US Department of Energy&#x27;s 2006 budget at the department&#x27;s request.

While the project for the RNEP seems to be in fact canceled, Jane&#x27;s Information Group speculated in 2005 that work might continue under another name.

A more recent development (c. 2012) is the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a conventional gravity bomb. The USAF&#x27;s B-2 Spirit bombers can each carry two such weapons.

<text>Apple Attachment Unit Interface (AAUI) is a mechanical re-design by Apple of the standard Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) used to connect computer equipment to Ethernet. The AUI was popular in the era before the dominance of 10BASE-T networking that started in the early 1990s; the AAUI was an attempt to make the connector much smaller and more user friendly, though the proprietary nature of the interface was also criticized.

==FriendlyNet==
AAUI is part of a system of Ethernet peripherals intended to make connecting over Ethernet easier. At the time of the introduction of AAUI, Ethernet systems usually were 10BASE2, also known as thinnet. Apple&#x27;s system is called FriendlyNet. A FriendlyNet 10BASE2 system does not use BNC T-connectors or separate terminators. Instead of a single BNC connector that is inserted into a T-connector placed inline, the FriendlyNet transceiver has two BNC connectors, one on each side, to which the cables are attached. The transceiver automatically terminates the network if a cable is missing from either side. Additionally, Apple 10BASE2 cables terminate the network when no device is attached to them. Thus the number of mistakes that could be made hooking up a thinnet network is reduced considerably. Since any of these mistakes can disable the network segment, this presents a significant improvement.

FriendlyNet equipment was expensive. Because of this, Apple&#x27;s computers, billed as having built-in Ethernet, were expensive to connect to Ethernet, perhaps adding as much as a tenth to the total price of the computer system. Additionally, AAUI held no advantage for any system other than 10BASE2, and thus as 10BASE-T became ubiquitous it became impossible to justify the cost of an external transceiver. Apple eventually abandoned the system and sold off the name.

Macintosh Quadra, Centris, PowerBook 500, Duo Dock II (for PowerBook Duo) and early Power Macintoshes have AAUI ports, which require external transceivers. By the time AAUI was nearing the end of its life, the cost of an AAUI transceiver became a burden for consumers. Later models include both AAUI and modular connector ports for directly connecting 10BASE-T; either can be used, but not both at the same time. AAUI connectors are also present on some Processor Direct Slot Ethernet adapter cards used in Macintosh LC and Performa machines. AAUI had disappeared by the late 1990s, when new Apple machines, starting with the beige Power Macintosh G3 series, include only the modular connector ports.

==Third-party vendors==
Many third parties also created AAUI transceivers. Most made simplifications to the connectors and cables, presumably to reduce costs. Most third parties, as well as any non-Apple equipment, would use standard 10BASE2 cabling, including T-connectors and manual termination. Additionally, Apple&#x27;s 10BASE2 cables were not appropriate for all uses since they only came in fixed lengths and the ends were not detachable, making it difficult to wire them through walls. Unfortunately, when mixing and matching Apple and non-Apple 10BASE2 devices, there were many seemingly natural configurations of cables and connectors which would cause the network to become unreliable or unusable in the area, reducing the value of the complex and proprietary Apple 10BASE2 wiring system.

==Connector and signals==
AUI uses a DA-15 connector and a sliding clip to mechanically secure the connection. AAUI replaces these with a small 14-position, 0.05-inch-spaced ribbon contact connector. This connector may have been chosen to avoid confusion with the monitor port on early Macintoshes, which also uses a DA-15. The connector locks into position using two clips or hooks on the sides of the connector outside of the shell which automatically clicks on when plugged in, and can be removed by pulling back on a sliding sheath over the body of the connector, disengaging the hooks. Third-party AAUI devices often omit this sheath, requiring the user to directly squeeze small tabs on the sides of the plug housing to detach the hooks.

AAUI signals have the same description, function, and electrical requirements as the Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) signals of the same name, as detailed in IEEE 802.3-1990 CSMA/CD Standard, section 7, with the exception that most hosts provide only 5 volts of power rather than the 12 volts required for most AUI transceivers. An adapter containing a power supply to provide the required 12 volts was available from Apple to permit connection of standard AUI transceivers to an AAUI port. This facilitated direct connection to 10BASE-F (fibre optic) and 10BASE5 (ThickNet) Ethernet networks, for which AAUI transceivers were not available.

<text>Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems (ATLAS) is a specialized programming language for use with automatic test equipment (ATE). It is a compiled high-level computer language and can be used on any computer whose supporting software can translate it into the appropriate low-level instructions.

== History ==
=== ATLAS Test Language ===
The original language was developed by Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (ARINC) and standardized under ANSI/IEEE-Std-416 and released on 22 December 1983. Its purpose was to serve as a standard programming language for testing and maintenance of electronic systems for military and commercial aerospace applications. The language was designed to be platform-independent.

The ATLAS language is oriented toward the Unit Under Test (UUT) and is independent of the test equipment used. This allows interchangeability of test procedures developed by different organizations, and thus reduces costly duplication of test programming effort.

The first ATLAS specification developed by the international committee was published in 1968. The basic document has been revised several times.

An ATLAS implementation typically consists of an online compiler (OLC), test executive (TEX or Test Exec), and file manager and media exchange (FMX) packages. ATLAS is run in TEX mode on test stations while testing electronic equipment.

== Syntax and Structure ==
The structure of an ATLAS program is very similar to FORTRAN. Standard ATLAS program structure consists of two elements: preamble structure and procedural structure. The language makes extensive use of variables and statement syntax. An ATLAS statement consists of these fields:
* : single character flag
* separator (space)
* : statement number
* separator (space)
* : verb
* separator (comma)
* : format depends on 
* statement terminator ($)

Sample ATLAS Statements:
 000250 DECLARE,DECIMAL,&#x27;A1&#x27;(4)$
 000300 FILL, &#x27;A1&#x27;, &#x27;NUM&#x27;,
 (1) 1, 5,
 (2) 20, 87,
 (3) 15, 12,
 (4) $30, 18

Comments may be included with a &#x27;C&#x27; in the field.

These ATLAS statements apply a voltage to a pin (stimulus) and verify the presence and characteristics of a voltage at a pin:
 010200 APPLY, AC SIGNAL, VOLTAGE-PP 7.5V, FREQ 3 kHz, CNX HI=P1-$1 
 010300 VERIFY, (VOLTAGE-AV INTO &#x27;VAVG&#x27;), AC SIGNAL, VOLTAGE-PP RANGE 64V TO 1V, SAMPLE-WIDTH 10MSEC, 
 SYNC-VOLTAGE 2 MAX 5, SYNC-NEG-SLOPE, MAX-TIME 0.5, GO-TO-STEP 400 IF GO, LL 0.5 UL 50, 
 CNX HI=P2-4 LO=P2-5, SYNC HI=P2-8 LO=P2-$5 

== Applications ==
ATLAS has been used in the U.S. Air Force primarily on test stations for testing the avionic components of the F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster III, and B-1 Lancer. The U.S. Navy uses ATLAS-based programs for testing avionics systems of the P-3C Orion, UH-1Y Venom, AH-1Z Viper, SH-60 Seahawk, E-2C Hawkeye, F-14 Tomcat, F/A-18 Hornet, S-3 Viking, A-6 Intruder, EA-6B Prowler, AV8B Harrier, and V-22 Osprey. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps used a version called Super Atlas for its AN/USM-484 hybrid test set (HTS) test benches. The AN/USM-247 VAST (Versatile Avionics Shop Test) was used by the Navy onboard aircraft carrier and shore stations. It has been used in testing the F-14, S-3, E-2, A-7 Corsair II, A-6, etc. VAST is considered by many to be the grandfather of modern avionics test equipment.

In the years that followed the cold war, ATLAS found uses on many dual-use aircraft for the U.S. and NATO, as well as commercial business, regional, and general aviation aircraft. ATLAS test program sets (TPS) allow porting older programs to new hardware, providing some protection against hardware obsolescence. Although a standard, many adaptations, customizations, and flavors exist that impede full portability. Because most ATLAS toolsets are custom, on custom hardware, with a custom software load for the platform, it is not as prone to some types of issues that plague other languages that are more prevalent in the industry; the down side is that training is not available to the general public, so it also requires an extensive investment in personnel.

ATLAS generally can be configured to run &quot;stand-alone&quot;, or &quot;stand-alone monitored only&quot; which can help limit many of the tampering and other concerns with mainstream commercial software. Other languages, such as BASIC, C/C++, Python, and Perl, are also used on commercial and military programs for testing of systems; ATLAS typically requires another computer system to either optically scan test results, or read a tape, disk, or locked memory stick/data key from a test station and then perform statistical analysis on test results for a variety of uses.

Subsets include:
== Implementations ==
* TYX (now Astronics) created a COTS ATLAS compiler, integrated development environment (IDE), and run time system, called Professional ATLAS Work Station (PAWS), that ran on the original IBM PC and was later updated for all flavors of Microsoft Windows.
* Lexico made translators that would convert ATLAS code to run under HP Rocky Mountain BASIC. These were popular with McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, Honeywell, etc.
* Grumman made an ATLAS compiler for their IFTE (Integrated Family of Test Equipment) V3 and V5 test stations.
* General Dynamics made a compiler for their F-16 test station.
* RCA developed a compiler for their EQUATE (Electronic Quality Assurance Test Equipment) testers.
* Marconi Space and Defence Systems (before they were Ferranti or GEC-Avionics) developed a compiler for their test systems called MATLAS. In the late 1980s/early 1990s, it was ported to an interpreted language on Windows called MABLE (an acronym for &quot;Matlas Applications using BORIS Language Extensions&quot;; BORIS is an acronym for &quot;Bill&#x27;s Own Run-time Interpretive System&quot;).
* Thorn EMI developed a version called EMIPAL (EMI&#x27;s Programmable Atlas Language) for use on its in-house test equipment, ADEPT (an acronym for &quot;Analogue and Digital Electronic Production Tester&quot;). Three were built two in the Dawley Road site in Hayes, Middlesex, and another at the Wells site in Somerset.

<doc id="60455" wikidata="Q605931" url="?curid=60455" title="Line-of-sight propagation">
<text>Line-of-sight propagation is a characteristic of electromagnetic radiation or acoustic wave propagation which means waves can only travel in a direct visual path from the source to the receiver without obstacles. Electromagnetic transmission includes light emissions traveling in a straight line. The rays or waves may be diffracted, refracted, reflected, or absorbed by the atmosphere and obstructions with material and generally cannot travel over the horizon or behind obstacles.

In contrast to line-of-sight propagation, at low frequency (below approximately 3 MHz) due to diffraction, radio waves can travel as ground waves, which follow the contour of the Earth. This enables AM radio stations to transmit beyond the horizon. Additionally, frequencies in the shortwave bands between approximately 1 and 30 MHz, can be refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, called skywave or &quot;skip&quot; propagation, thus giving radio transmissions in this range a potentially global reach.

However, at frequencies above 30 MHz (VHF and higher) and in lower levels of the atmosphere, neither of these effects are significant. Thus, any obstruction between the transmitting antenna (transmitter) and the receiving antenna (receiver) will block the signal, just like the light that the eye may sense. Therefore, since the ability to visually see a transmitting antenna (disregarding the limitations of the eye&#x27;s resolution) roughly corresponds to the ability to receive a radio signal from it, the propagation characteristic at these frequencies is called &quot;line-of-sight&quot;. The farthest possible point of propagation is referred to as the &quot;radio horizon&quot;.

In practice, the propagation characteristics of these radio waves vary substantially depending on the exact frequency and the strength of the transmitted signal (a function of both the transmitter and the antenna characteristics). Broadcast FM radio, at comparatively low frequencies of around 100 MHz, are less affected by the presence of buildings and forests.

== Impairments to line-of-sight propagation ==

Low-powered microwave transmitters can be foiled by tree branches, or even heavy rain or snow. The presence of objects not in the direct line-of-sight can cause diffraction effects that disrupt radio transmissions. For the best propagation, a volume known as the first Fresnel zone should be free of obstructions.

Reflected radiation from the surface of the surrounding ground or salt water can also either cancel out or enhance the direct signal. This effect can be reduced by raising either or both antennas further from the ground: The reduction in loss achieved is known as &quot;height gain&quot;.

See also Non-line-of-sight propagation for more on impairments in propagation.

It is important to take into account the curvature of the Earth for calculation of line-of-sight paths from maps, when a direct visual fix cannot be made. Designs for microwave formerly used  Earth radius to compute clearances along the path.

== Mobile telephones ==
Although the frequencies used by mobile phones (cell phones) are in the line-of-sight range, they still function in cities. This is made possible by a combination of the following effects:
* propagation over the rooftop landscape
* diffraction into the &quot;street canyon&quot; below
* multipath reflection along the street
* diffraction through windows, and attenuated passage through walls, into the building
* reflection, diffraction, and attenuated passage through internal walls, floors and ceilings within the building

The combination of all these effects makes the mobile phone propagation environment highly complex, with multipath effects and extensive Rayleigh fading. For mobile phone services, these problems are tackled using:
* rooftop or hilltop positioning of base stations
* many base stations (usually called &quot;cell sites&quot;). A phone can typically see at least three, and usually as many as six at any given time.
* &quot;sectorized&quot; antennas at the base stations. Instead of one antenna with omnidirectional coverage, the station may use as few as 3 (rural areas with few customers) or as many as 32 separate antennas, each covering a portion of the circular coverage. This allows the base station to use a directional antenna that is pointing at the user, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio. If the user moves (perhaps by walking or driving) from one antenna sector to another, the base station automatically selects the proper antenna.
* rapid handoff between base stations (roaming)
* the radio link used by the phones is a digital link with extensive error correction and detection in the digital protocol
* sufficient operation of mobile phone in tunnels when supported by split cable antennas
* local repeaters inside complex vehicles or buildings

A Faraday cage is composed of a conductor that completely surrounds an area on all sides, top, and bottom. Electromagnetic radiation is blocked where the wavelength is longer than any gaps. For example, mobile telephone signals are blocked in windowless metal enclosures that approximate a Faraday cage, such as elevator cabins, and parts of trains, cars, and ships. The same problem can affect signals in buildings with extensive steel reinforcement.

== Radio horizon ==
The &quot;radio horizon&quot; is the locus of points at which direct rays from an antenna are tangential to the surface of the Earth. If the Earth were a perfect sphere without an atmosphere, the radio horizon would be a circle.

The radio horizon of the transmitting and receiving antennas can be added together to increase the effective communication range. 

Radio wave propagation is affected by atmospheric conditions, ionospheric absorption, and the presence of obstructions, for example mountains or trees. 
Simple formulas that include the effect of the atmosphere give the range as:
:formula_1

:formula_2
The simple formulas give a best-case approximation of the maximum propagation distance, but are not sufficient to estimate the quality of service at any location.

=== Earth bulge ===
In telecommunications, Earth bulge refers to the effect of earth&#x27;s curvature on radio propagation. It is a consequence of a circular segment of earth profile that blocks off long-distance communications. Since the vacuum line of sight passes at varying heights over the Earth, the propagating radio wave encounters slightly different propagation conditions over the path.

=== Vacuum distance to horizon ===
Assuming a perfect sphere with no terrain irregularity, the distance to the horizon from a high altitude transmitter (i.e., line of sight) can readily be calculated.

Let &quot;R&quot; be the radius of the Earth and &quot;h&quot; be the altitude of a telecommunication station. The line of sight distance &quot;d&quot; of this station is given by the Pythagorean theorem;

: formula_3

The altitude of the station &quot;h&quot; is much smaller than the radius of the Earth &quot;R.&quot; Therefore, formula_4 can be neglected compared with formula_5. 

Thus:

: formula_6

If the height &quot;h&quot; is given in metres, and distance &quot;d&quot; in kilometres,
: formula_7

If the height &quot;h&quot; is given in feet, and the distance &quot;d&quot; in statute miles,

: formula_8
In the case, when there are two stations involve, e.g. a transmit station on ground with a station height &quot;h&quot; and a receive station in the air with a station height &quot;H&quot;, the line of sight distance can be calculated as follows:
 formula_9

=== Atmospheric refraction ===

The usual effect of the declining pressure of the atmosphere with height (vertical pressure variation) is to bend (refract) radio waves down towards the surface of the Earth. This results in an effective Earth radius, increased by a factor around . This &quot;k&quot;-factor can change from its average value depending on weather.

====Refracted distance to horizon====
The previous vacuum distance analysis does not consider the effect of atmosphere on the propagation path of RF signals. In fact, RF signals do not propagate in straight lines: Because of the refractive effects of atmospheric layers, the propagation paths are somewhat curved. Thus, the maximum service range of the station is not equal to the line of sight vacuum distance. Usually, a factor &quot;k&quot; is used in the equation above, modified to be

: formula_10

&quot;k&quot; &gt; 1 means geometrically reduced bulge and a longer service range. On the other hand, &quot;k&quot; &lt; 1 means a shorter service range.

Under normal weather conditions, &quot;k&quot; is usually chosen to be . That means that the maximum service range increases by 15%.

: formula_11
for &quot;h&quot; in metres and &quot;d&quot; in kilometres; or

: formula_12
for &quot;h&quot; in feet and &quot;d&quot; in miles.

But in stormy weather, &quot;k&quot; may decrease to cause fading in transmission. (In extreme cases &quot;k&quot; can be less than 1.) That is equivalent to a hypothetical decrease in Earth radius and an increase of Earth bulge.

For example, in normal weather conditions, the service range of a station at an altitude of 1500 m with respect to receivers at sea level can be found as,

: formula_13

<doc id="60459" wikidata="Q308495" url="?curid=60459" title="Abductive reasoning">
<text>Abductive reasoning (also called abduction, abductive inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference that seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from a set of observations. It was formulated and advanced by American philosopher and logician Charles Sanders Peirce beginning in the latter half of the 19th century.

Abductive reasoning, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it. Abductive conclusions do not eliminate uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as &quot;best available&quot; or &quot;most likely&quot;. While inductive reasoning draws general conclusions that apply to many situations, abductive conclusions are confined to the particular observations in question.

In the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law, computer science, and artificial intelligence research spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction.
Diagnostic expert systems frequently employ abduction.

== Deduction, induction, and abduction==
=== Deduction ===

Deductive reasoning allows deriving formula_1 from formula_2 only where formula_1 is a formal logical consequence of formula_2. In other words, deduction derives the consequences of the assumed. Given the truth of the assumptions, a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion. For example, given that &quot;Wikis can be edited by anyone&quot; (formula_5) and &quot;Wikipedia is a wiki&quot; (formula_6), it follows that &quot;Wikipedia can be edited by anyone&quot; (formula_1).

=== Induction ===

Inductive reasoning is the process of inferring some &quot;general&quot; principle formula_1 from a body of knowledge formula_2, where formula_1 does not necessarily follow from formula_2. formula_2 might give us very good reason to accept formula_1 but does not ensure formula_1. For example, if it is given that 95% percent of the elephants are gray, and Louise is an elephant, one can &quot;induce&quot; that Louise is gray. Still, this is not necessarily the case: 5 percent of the time this conclusion will be wrong.

However, an inference being derived from statistical data is not sufficient to classify it as inductive. For example, if all swans that a person has observed so far are white, they may instead &quot;abduce&quot; the possibility that all swans are white. They have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise because it is the &quot;best explanation&quot; for their observations, and the truth of the conclusion is still not guaranteed. (Indeed, it turns out that some swans are black.)

=== Abduction ===
Abductive reasoning allows inferring formula_2 as an explanation of formula_1. As a result of this inference, abduction allows the precondition formula_2 to be abducted from the consequence formula_1. Deductive reasoning and abductive reasoning thus differ in which end, left or right, of the proposition &quot;formula_2 entails formula_1&quot; serves as conclusion. For example, in a billiard game, after glancing and seeing the eight ball moving towards us, we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball. The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball. It serves as a hypothesis that &quot;best explains&quot; our observation. Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball, our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball, but our abduction, still useful, can serve to orient us in our surroundings. Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of priors in Bayesian statistics.

One can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation, although not all usages of the terms &quot;abduction&quot; and &quot;inference to the best explanation&quot; are equivalent.

==Formalizations of abduction==

===Logic-based abduction===
In logic, explanation is accomplished through the use of a logical theory formula_21 representing a domain and a set of observations formula_22. Abduction is the process of deriving a set of explanations of formula_22 according to formula_21 and picking out one of those explanations. For formula_25 to be an explanation of formula_22 according to formula_21, it should satisfy two conditions:

* formula_22 follows from formula_25 and formula_21;
* formula_25 is consistent with formula_21.

In formal logic, formula_22 and formula_25 are assumed to be sets of literals. The two conditions for formula_25 being an explanation of formula_22 according to theory formula_21 are formalized as:

:formula_38
:formula_39 is consistent.

Among the possible explanations formula_25 satisfying these two conditions, some other condition of minimality is usually imposed to avoid irrelevant facts (not contributing to the entailment of formula_22) being included in the explanations. Abduction is then the process that picks out some member of formula_25. Criteria for picking out a member representing &quot;the best&quot; explanation include the simplicity, the prior probability, or the explanatory power of the explanation.

A proof-theoretical abduction method for first-order classical logic based on the sequent calculus and a dual one, based on semantic tableaux (analytic tableaux) have been proposed. The methods are sound and complete and work for full first-order logic, without requiring any preliminary reduction of formulae into normal forms. These methods have also been extended to modal logic.

Abductive logic programming is a computational framework that extends normal logic programming with abduction. It separates the theory formula_21 into two components, one of which is a normal logic program, used to generate formula_25 by means of backward reasoning, the other of which is a set of integrity constraints, used to filter the set of candidate explanations.

===Set-cover abduction===
A different formalization of abduction is based on inverting the function that calculates the visible effects of the hypotheses. Formally, we are given a set of hypotheses formula_45 and a set of manifestations formula_46; they are related by the domain knowledge, represented by a function formula_47 that takes as an argument a set of hypotheses and gives as a result the corresponding set of manifestations. In other words, for every subset of the hypotheses formula_48, their effects are known to be formula_49.

Abduction is performed by finding a set formula_48 such that formula_51. In other words, abduction is performed by finding a set of hypotheses formula_52 such that their effects formula_49 include all observations formula_46.

A common assumption is that the effects of the hypotheses are independent, that is, for every formula_48, it holds that formula_56. If this condition is met, abduction can be seen as a form of set covering.

===Abductive validation===
Abductive validation is the process of validating a given hypothesis through abductive reasoning. This can also be called reasoning through successive approximation. Under this principle, an explanation is valid if it is the best possible explanation of a set of known data. The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity and elegance (see Occam&#x27;s razor). Abductive validation is common practice in hypothesis formation in science; moreover, Peirce claims that it is a ubiquitous aspect of thought:

It was Peirce&#x27;s own maxim that &quot;Facts cannot be explained by a hypothesis more extraordinary than these facts themselves; and of various hypotheses the least extraordinary must be adopted.&quot; After obtaining possible hypotheses that may explain the facts, abductive validation is a method for identifying the most likely hypothesis that should be adopted.

===Subjective logic abduction===
Subjective logic generalises probabilistic logic by including degrees of epistemic uncertainty in the input arguments, i.e. instead of probabilities, the analyst can express arguments as subjective opinions. Abduction in subjective logic is thus a generalization of probabilistic abduction described above. The input arguments in subjective logic are subjective opinions which can be binomial when the opinion applies to a binary variable or multinomial when it applies to an &quot;n&quot;-ary variable. A subjective opinion thus applies to a state variable formula_57 which takes its values from a domain formula_58 (i.e. a state space of exhaustive and mutually disjoint state values formula_59), and is denoted by the tuple formula_60, where formula_61 is the belief mass distribution over formula_58, formula_63 is the epistemic uncertainty mass, and formula_64 is the base rate distribution over formula_58. These parameters satisfy formula_66 and formula_67 as well as formula_68.

Assume the domains formula_58 and formula_70 with respective variables formula_57 and formula_72, the set of conditional opinions formula_73 (i.e. one conditional opinion for each value formula_74), and the base rate distribution formula_75. Based on these parameters, the subjective Bayes&#x27; theorem denoted with the operator formula_76 produces the set of inverted conditionals formula_77 (i.e. one inverted conditional for each value formula_59) expressed by:

:formula_79. The equality between the different expressions for subjective abduction is given below:

:formula_80&quot;, and the operator itself is denoted as &quot;formula_81&quot;. The operator for the subjective Bayes&#x27; theorem is denoted &quot;formula_82&quot;, and subjective deduction is denoted &quot;formula_83&quot;.

The advantage of using subjective logic abduction compared to probabilistic abduction is that both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty about the input argument probabilities can be explicitly expressed and taken into account during the analysis. It is thus possible to perform abductive analysis in the presence of uncertain arguments, which naturally results in degrees of uncertainty in the output conclusions.

==History==

The idea that the simplest, most easily verifiable solution should be preferred over its more complicated counterparts is a very old one. To this point, George Pólya, in his treatise on problem-solving, makes reference to the following Latin truism: &quot;simplex sigillum veri&quot; (simplicity is the seal of truth).

===Introduction and development by Peirce===
====Overview====
The American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce introduced abduction into modern logic. Over the years he called such inference &quot;hypothesis&quot;, &quot;abduction&quot;, &quot;presumption&quot;, and &quot;retroduction&quot;. He considered it a topic in logic as a normative field in philosophy, not in purely formal or mathematical logic, and eventually as a topic also in economics of research.

As two stages of the development, extension, etc., of a hypothesis in scientific inquiry, abduction and also induction are often collapsed into one overarching concept—the hypothesis. That is why, in the scientific method known from Galileo and Bacon, the abductive stage of hypothesis formation is conceptualized simply as induction. Thus, in the twentieth century this collapse was reinforced by Karl Popper&#x27;s explication of the hypothetico-deductive model, where the hypothesis is considered to be just &quot;a guess&quot; (in the spirit of Peirce). However, when the formation of a hypothesis is considered the result of a process it becomes clear that this &quot;guess&quot; has already been tried and made more robust in thought as a necessary stage of its acquiring the status of hypothesis. Indeed, many abductions are rejected or heavily modified by subsequent abductions before they ever reach this stage.

Before 1900, Peirce treated abduction as the use of a known rule to explain an observation. For instance: it is a known rule that, if it rains, grass gets wet; so, to explain the fact that the grass on this lawn is wet, one &quot;abduces&quot; that it has rained. Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules that might explain the observation are not taken into accounte.g. the grass could be wet from dew. This remains the common use of the term &quot;abduction&quot; in the social sciences and in artificial intelligence.

Peirce consistently characterized it as the kind of inference that originates a hypothesis by concluding in an explanation, though an unassured one, for some very curious or surprising (anomalous) observation stated in a premise. As early as 1865 he wrote that all conceptions of cause and force are reached through hypothetical inference; in the 1900s he wrote that all explanatory content of theories is reached through abduction. In other respects Peirce revised his view of abduction over the years.

In later years his view came to be:
* Abduction is guessing. It is &quot;very little hampered&quot; by rules of logic. Even a well-prepared mind&#x27;s individual guesses are more frequently wrong than right. But the success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instinct (some speak of intuition in such contexts).
* Abduction guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a plausible, instinctive, economical way for a surprising or very complicated phenomenon. That is its proximate aim.
* Its longer aim is to economize inquiry itself. Its rationale is inductive: it works often enough, is the only source of new ideas, and has no substitute in expediting the discovery of new truths. Its rationale especially involves its role in coordination with other modes of inference in inquiry. It is inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying.
* Pragmatism is the logic of abduction. Upon the generation of an explanation (which he came to regard as instinctively guided), the pragmatic maxim gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have conceivable implications for informed practice, so as to be testable and, through its trials, to expedite and economize inquiry. The economy of research is what calls for abduction and governs its art.

Writing in 1910, Peirce admits that &quot;in almost everything I printed before the beginning of this century I more or less mixed up hypothesis and induction&quot; and he traces the confusion of these two types of reasoning to logicians&#x27; too &quot;narrow and formalistic a conception of inference, as necessarily having formulated judgments from its premises.&quot;

He started out in the 1860s treating hypothetical inference in a number of ways which he eventually peeled away as inessential or, in some cases, mistaken:
* as inferring the occurrence of a character (a characteristic) from the observed combined occurrence of multiple characters which its occurrence would necessarily involve; for example, if any occurrence of &quot;A&quot; is known to necessitate occurrence of &quot;B, C, D, E&quot;, then the observation of &quot;B, C, D, E&quot; suggests by way of explanation the occurrence of &quot;A&quot;. (But by 1878 he no longer regarded such multiplicity as common to all hypothetical inference.Wikisource)
* as aiming for a more or less probable hypothesis (in 1867 and 1883 but not in 1878; anyway by 1900 the justification is not probability but the lack of alternatives to guessing and the fact that guessing is fruitful; by 1903 he speaks of the &quot;likely&quot; in the sense of nearing the truth in an &quot;indefinite sense&quot;; by 1908 he discusses &quot;plausibility&quot; as instinctive appeal.) In a paper dated by editors as &quot;circa&quot; 1901, he discusses &quot;instinct&quot; and &quot;naturalness&quot;, along with the kind of considerations (low cost of testing, logical caution, breadth, and incomplexity) that he later calls methodeutical.
* as induction from characters (but as early as 1900 he characterized abduction as guessing)
* as citing a known rule in a premise rather than hypothesizing a rule in the conclusion (but by 1903 he allowed either approach)
* as basically a transformation of a deductive categorical syllogism (but in 1903 he offered a variation on &quot;modus ponens&quot; instead, and by 1911 he was unconvinced that any one form covers all hypothetical inference).

====&quot;The Natural Classification of Arguments&quot; (1867)====
In 1867, Peirce&#x27;s &quot;On the Natural Classification of Arguments&quot;, hypothetical inference always deals with a cluster of characters (call them &quot;P′, P′′, P′′′,&quot; etc.) known to occur at least whenever a certain character (&quot;M&quot;) occurs. Note that categorical syllogisms have elements traditionally called middles, predicates, and subjects. For example: All &quot;men&quot; [middle] are &quot;mortal&quot; [predicate]; &quot;Socrates&quot; [subject] is a &quot;man&quot; [middle]; ergo &quot;Socrates&quot; [subject] is &quot;mortal&quot; [predicate]&quot;. Below, &#x27;M&#x27; stands for a middle; &#x27;P&#x27; for a predicate; &#x27;S&#x27; for a subject. Peirce held that all deduction can be put into the form of the categorical syllogism Barbara (AAA-1).

====&quot;Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis&quot; (1878)====
In 1878, in &quot;Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis&quot;, there is no longer a need for multiple characters or predicates in order for an inference to be hypothetical, although it is still helpful. Moreover, Peirce no longer poses hypothetical inference as concluding in a &quot;probable&quot; hypothesis. In the forms themselves, it is understood but not explicit that induction involves random selection and that hypothetical inference involves response to a &quot;very curious circumstance&quot;. The forms instead emphasize the modes of inference as rearrangements of one another&#x27;s propositions (without the bracketed hints shown below).

====&quot;A Theory of Probable Inference&quot; (1883)====
Peirce long treated abduction in terms of induction from characters or traits (weighed, not counted like objects), explicitly so in his influential 1883 &quot;A theory of probable inference&quot;, in which he returns to involving probability in the hypothetical conclusion. Like &quot;Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis&quot; in 1878, it was widely read (see the historical books on statistics by Stephen Stigler), unlike his later amendments of his conception of abduction. Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters and extension of a known rule to cover unexplained circumstances.

Sherlock Holmes used this method of reasoning in the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle, although Holmes refers to it as &quot;deductive reasoning&quot;.

====&quot;Minute Logic&quot; (1902) and after====
In 1902 Peirce wrote that he now regarded the syllogistical forms and the doctrine of extension and comprehension (i.e., objects and characters as referenced by terms), as being less fundamental than he had earlier thought. In 1903 he offered the following form for abduction: 

The hypothesis is framed, but not asserted, in a premise, then asserted as rationally suspectable in the conclusion. Thus, as in the earlier categorical syllogistic form, the conclusion is formulated from some premise(s). But all the same the hypothesis consists more clearly than ever in a new or outside idea beyond what is known or observed. Induction in a sense goes beyond observations already reported in the premises, but it merely amplifies ideas already known to represent occurrences, or tests an idea supplied by hypothesis; either way it requires previous abductions in order to get such ideas in the first place. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts.

Note that the hypothesis (&quot;A&quot;) could be of a rule. It need not even be a rule strictly necessitating the surprising observation (&quot;C&quot;), which needs to follow only as a &quot;matter of course&quot;; or the &quot;course&quot; itself could amount to some known rule, merely alluded to, and also not necessarily a rule of strict necessity. In the same year, Peirce wrote that reaching a hypothesis may involve placing a surprising observation under either a newly hypothesized rule or a hypothesized combination of a known rule with a peculiar state of facts, so that the phenomenon would be not surprising but instead either necessarily implied or at least likely.

Peirce did not remain quite convinced about any such form as the categorical syllogistic form or the 1903 form. In 1911, he wrote, &quot;I do not, at present, feel quite convinced that any logical form can be assigned that will cover all &#x27;Retroductions&#x27;. For what I mean by a Retroduction is simply a conjecture which arises in the mind.&quot;

====Pragmatism====
In 1901 Peirce wrote, &quot;There would be no logic in imposing rules, and saying that they ought to be followed, until it is made out that the purpose of hypothesis requires them.&quot; In 1903 Peirce called pragmatism &quot;the logic of abduction&quot; and said that the pragmatic maxim gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general. The pragmatic maxim is:

It is a method for fruitful clarification of conceptions by equating the meaning of a conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object&#x27;s conceived effects. Peirce held that that is precisely tailored to abduction&#x27;s purpose in inquiry, the forming of an idea that could conceivably shape informed conduct. In various writings in the 1900s he said that the conduct of abduction (or retroduction) is governed by considerations of economy, belonging in particular to the economics of research. He regarded economics as a normative science whose analytic portion might be part of logical methodeutic (that is, theory of inquiry).

====Three levels of logic about abduction====
Peirce came over the years to divide (philosophical) logic into three departments: 
# Stechiology, or speculative grammar, on the conditions for meaningfulness. Classification of signs (semblances, symptoms, symbols, etc.) and their combinations (as well as their objects and interpretants).
# Logical critic, or logic proper, on validity or justifiability of inference, the conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various modes (deduction, induction, abduction).
# Methodeutic, or speculative rhetoric, on the conditions for determination of interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its interplay of modes.
Peirce had, from the start, seen the modes of inference as being coordinated together in scientific inquiry and, by the 1900s, held that hypothetical inference in particular is inadequately treated at the level of critique of arguments. To increase the assurance of a hypothetical conclusion, one needs to deduce implications about evidence to be found, predictions which induction can test through observation so as to evaluate the hypothesis. That is Peirce&#x27;s outline of the scientific method of inquiry, as covered in his inquiry methodology, which includes pragmatism or, as he later called it, pragmaticism, the clarification of ideas in terms of their conceivable implications regarding informed practice.

=====Classification of signs=====
As early as 1866, Peirce held that:

1. Hypothesis (abductive inference) is inference through an &quot;icon&quot; (also called a &quot;likeness&quot;). 
2. Induction is inference through an &quot;index&quot; (a sign by factual connection); a sample is an index of the totality from which it is drawn. 
3. Deduction is inference through a &quot;symbol&quot; (a sign by interpretive habit irrespective of resemblance or connection to its object).

In 1902, Peirce wrote that, in abduction: &quot;It is recognized that the phenomena are &quot;like&quot;, i.e. constitute an Icon of, a replica of a general conception, or Symbol.&quot;

=====Critique of arguments=====
At the critical level Peirce examined the forms of abductive arguments (as discussed above), and came to hold that the hypothesis should economize explanation for plausibility in terms of the feasible and natural. In 1908 Peirce described this plausibility in some detail. It involves not likeliness based on observations (which is instead the inductive evaluation of a hypothesis), but instead optimal simplicity in the sense of the &quot;facile and natural&quot;, as by Galileo&#x27;s natural light of reason and as distinct from &quot;logical simplicity&quot; (Peirce does not dismiss logical simplicity entirely but sees it in a subordinate role; taken to its logical extreme it would favor adding no explanation to the observation at all). Even a well-prepared mind guesses oftener wrong than right, but our guesses succeed better than random luck at reaching the truth or at least advancing the inquiry, and that indicates to Peirce that they are based in instinctive attunement to nature, an affinity between the mind&#x27;s processes and the processes of the real, which would account for why appealingly &quot;natural&quot; guesses are the ones that oftenest (or least seldom) succeed; to which Peirce added the argument that such guesses are to be preferred since, without &quot;a natural bent like nature&#x27;s&quot;, people would have no hope of understanding nature. In 1910 Peirce made a three-way distinction between probability, verisimilitude, and plausibility, and defined plausibility with a normative &quot;ought&quot;: &quot;By plausibility, I mean the degree to which a theory ought to recommend itself to our belief independently of any kind of evidence other than our instinct urging us to regard it favorably.&quot; For Peirce, plausibility does not depend on observed frequencies or probabilities, or on verisimilitude, or even on testability, which is not a question of the critique of the hypothetical inference &quot;as&quot; an inference, but rather a question of the hypothesis&#x27;s relation to the inquiry process.

The phrase &quot;inference to the best explanation&quot; (not used by Peirce but often applied to hypothetical inference) is not always understood as referring to the most simple and natural hypotheses (such as those with the fewest assumptions). However, in other senses of &quot;best&quot;, such as &quot;standing up best to tests&quot;, it is hard to know which is the best explanation to form, since one has not tested it yet. Still, for Peirce, any justification of an abductive inference as &quot;good&quot; is not completed upon its formation as an argument (unlike with induction and deduction) and instead depends also on its methodological role and promise (such as its testability) in advancing inquiry.

=====Methodology of inquiry=====
At the methodeutical level Peirce held that a hypothesis is judged and selected for testing because it offers, via its trial, to expedite and economize the inquiry process itself toward new truths, first of all by being testable and also by further economies, in terms of cost, value, and relationships among guesses (hypotheses). Here, considerations such as probability, absent from the treatment of abduction at the critical level, come into play. For examples:
* Cost: A simple but low-odds guess, if low in cost to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing, to get it out of the way. If surprisingly it stands up to tests, that is worth knowing early in the inquiry, which otherwise might have stayed long on a wrong though seemingly likelier track.
* Value: A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctual plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be treacherous.
* Interrelationships: Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically for their
** &quot;caution&quot;, for which Peirce gave as an example the game of Twenty Questions,
** &quot;breadth&quot; of applicability to explain various phenomena, and
** &quot;incomplexity&quot;, that of a hypothesis that seems too simple but whose trial &quot;may give a good &#x27;leave&#x27;, as the billiard-players say&quot;, and be instructive for the pursuit of various and conflicting hypotheses that are less simple.

====Uberty====
Peirce indicated that abductive reasoning is driven by the need for &quot;economy in research&quot;—the expected fact-based productivity of hypotheses, prior to deductive and inductive processes of verification. A key concept proposed by him in this regard is &quot;&quot;—the expected fertility and pragmatic value of reasoning. This concept seems to be gaining support via association to the Free Energy Principle.

===Gilbert Harman (1965)===
Gilbert Harman was a professor of philosophy at Princeton University. Harman&#x27;s 1965 account of the role of &quot;inference to the best explanation&quot; – inferring the existence of that which we need for the best explanation of observable phenomena – has been very influential.

===Stephen Jay Gould (1995)===
Stephen Jay Gould, in answering the Omphalos hypothesis, claimed that only hypotheses that can be proved incorrect lie within the domain of science and only these hypotheses are good explanations of facts worth inferring to. 

==Applications==

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Applications in artificial intelligence include fault diagnosis, belief revision, and automated planning. The most direct application of abduction is that of automatically detecting faults in systems: given a theory relating faults with their effects and a set of observed effects, abduction can be used to derive sets of faults that are likely to be the cause of the problem.

=== Medicine ===
In medicine, abduction can be seen as a component of clinical evaluation and judgment. The Internist-I diagnostic system, the first AI system that covered the field of Internal Medicine, used abductive reasoning to converge on the most likely causes of a set of patient symptoms that it acquired through an interactive dialog with an expert user.

=== Automated planning ===
Abduction can also be used to model automated planning. Given a logical theory relating action occurrences with their effects (for example, a formula of the event calculus), the problem of finding a plan for reaching a state can be modeled as the problem of abducting a set of literals implying that the final state is the goal state.

=== Intelligence analysis ===
In intelligence analysis, analysis of competing hypotheses and Bayesian networks, probabilistic abductive reasoning is used extensively. Similarly in medical diagnosis and legal reasoning, the same methods are being used, although there have been many examples of errors, especially caused by the base rate fallacy and the prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy.

=== Belief revision ===

Belief revision, the process of adapting beliefs in view of new information, is another field in which abduction has been applied. The main problem of belief revision is that the new information may be inconsistent with the prior web of beliefs, while the result of the incorporation cannot be inconsistent. The process of updating the web of beliefs can be done by the use of abduction: once an explanation for the observation has been found, integrating it does not generate inconsistency.

Gärdenfors’ paper contains a brief survey of the area of belief revision and its relation to updating of logical databases, and explores the relationship between belief revision and nonmonotonic logic.

This use of abduction is not straightforward, as adding propositional formulae to other propositional formulae can only make inconsistencies worse. Instead, abduction is done at the level of the ordering of preference of the possible worlds. Preference models use fuzzy logic or utility models.

=== Philosophy of science ===
In the philosophy of science, abduction has been the key inference method to support scientific realism, and much of the debate about scientific realism is focused on whether abduction is an acceptable method of inference.

=== Historical linguistics ===
In historical linguistics, abduction during language acquisition is often taken to be an essential part of processes of language change such as reanalysis and analogy.

=== Applied linguistics ===
In applied linguistics research, abductive reasoning is starting to be used as an alternative explanation to inductive reasoning, in recognition of anticipated outcomes of qualitative inquiry playing a role in shaping the direction of analysis. It is defined as &quot;The use of an unclear premise based on observations, pursuing theories to try to explain it&quot; (Rose et al., 2020, p. 258)

=== Anthropology ===
In anthropology, Alfred Gell in his influential book &quot;Art and Agency&quot; defined abduction (after Eco) as &quot;a case of synthetic inference &#x27;where we find some very curious circumstances, which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule, and thereupon adopt that supposition. Gell criticizes existing &quot;anthropological&quot; studies of art for being too preoccupied with aesthetic value and not preoccupied enough with the central anthropological concern of uncovering &quot;social relationships&quot;, specifically the social contexts in which artworks are produced, circulated, and received. Abduction is used as the mechanism for getting from art to agency. That is, abduction can explain how works of art inspire a &quot;sensus communis:&quot; the commonly held views shared by members that characterize a given society.

The question Gell asks in the book is, &quot;how does it initially &#x27;speak&#x27; to people?&quot; He answers by saying that &quot;No reasonable person could suppose that art-like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of semiosis.&quot; However, he rejects any intimation that semiosis can be thought of as a language because then he would have to admit to some pre-established existence of the &quot;sensus communis&quot; that he wants to claim only emerges afterwards out of art. Abduction is the answer to this conundrum because the tentative nature of the abduction concept (Peirce likened it to guessing) means that not only can it operate outside of any pre-existing framework, but moreover, it can actually intimate the existence of a framework. As Gell reasons in his analysis, the physical existence of the artwork prompts the viewer to perform an abduction that imbues the artwork with intentionality. A statue of a goddess, for example, in some senses actually becomes the goddess in the mind of the beholder; and represents not only the form of the deity but also her intentions (which are adduced from the feeling of her very presence). Therefore, through abduction, Gell claims that art can have the kind of agency that plants the seeds that grow into cultural myths. The power of agency is the power to motivate actions and inspire ultimately the shared understanding that characterizes any given society.

===Computer programming===
In formal methods, logic is used to specify and prove properties of computer programs. Abduction has been used in mechanized reasoning tools to increase the level of automation of the proof activity.

A technique known as bi-abduction, which mixes abduction and the frame problem, was used to scale reasoning techniques for memory properties to millions of lines of code; logic-based abduction was used to infer pre-conditions for individual functions in a program, relieving the human of the need to do so. It led to a program-proof startup company, which was acquired by Facebook, and the Infer program analysis tool, which led to thousands of bugs being prevented in industrial codebases.

In addition to inference of function preconditions, abduction has been used to automate inference of invariants for program loops, inference of specifications of unknown code, and in synthesis of the programs themselves.

<doc id="60471" wikidata="Q721623" url="?curid=60471" title="Application binary interface">
<text>In computer software, an application binary interface (ABI) is an interface between two binary program modules. Often, one of these modules is a library or operating system facility, and the other is a program that is being run by a user.

An ABI defines how data structures or computational routines are accessed in machine code, which is a low-level, hardware-dependent format. In contrast, an application programming interface (API) defines this access in source code, which is a relatively high-level, hardware-independent, often human-readable format. A common aspect of an ABI is the calling convention, which determines how data is provided as input to, or read as output from, computational routines. Examples of this are the x86 calling conventions.

Adhering to an ABI (which may or may not be officially standardized) is usually the job of a compiler, operating system, or library author. However, an application programmer may have to deal with an ABI directly when writing a program in a mix of programming languages, or even compiling a program written in the same language with different compilers.

== Description ==
Details covered by an ABI include the following:
* Processor instruction set, with details like register file structure, stack organization, memory access types, etc.
* Sizes, layouts, and alignments of basic data types that the processor can directly access
* Calling convention, which controls how the arguments of functions are passed, and return values retrieved; for example, it controls the following:
** Whether all parameters are passed on the stack, or some are passed in registers
** Which registers are used for which function parameters
** Whether the first function parameter passed on the stack is pushed first or last
** Whether the caller or callee is responsible for cleaning up the stack after the function call
* How an application should make system calls to the operating system, and if the ABI specifies direct system calls rather than procedure calls to system call stubs, the system call numbers
* In the case of a complete operating system ABI, the binary format of object files, program libraries, etc.

== Complete ABIs ==
A complete ABI, such as the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard (iBCS), allows a program from one operating system supporting that ABI to run without modifications on any other such system, provided that necessary shared libraries are present, and similar prerequisites are fulfilled.

ABIs can also standardize details such as the C++ name mangling, exception propagation, and calling convention between compilers on the same platform, but do not require cross-platform compatibility.

== Embedded ABIs ==
An &quot;embedded-application binary interface&quot; (EABI) specifies standard conventions for file formats, data types, register usage, stack frame organization, and function parameter passing of an embedded software program, for use with an embedded operating system.

Compilers that support the EABI create object code that is compatible with code generated by other such compilers, allowing developers to link libraries generated with one compiler with object code generated with another compiler. Developers writing their own assembly language code may also interface with assembly generated by a compliant compiler.

EABIs are designed to optimize for performance within the limited resources of an embedded system. Therefore, EABIs omit most abstractions that are made between kernel and user code in complex operating systems. For example, dynamic linking may be avoided to allow smaller executables and faster loading, fixed register usage allows more compact stacks and kernel calls, and running the application in privileged mode allows direct access to custom hardware operation without the indirection of calling a device driver. The choice of EABI can affect performance.

Widely used EABIs include PowerPC, Arm EABI and MIPS EABI. Specific software implementations like the C library may impose additional limitations to form more concrete ABIs; one example is the GNU OABI and EABI for ARM, both of which are subsets of the ARM EABI .

<doc id="60476" wikidata="Q538050" url="?curid=60476" title="Augmented Backus–Naur form">
<text>In computer science, augmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF) is a metalanguage based on Backus–Naur form (BNF) but consisting of its own syntax and derivation rules. The motive principle for ABNF is to describe a formal system of a language to be used as a bidirectional communications protocol. It is defined by &quot;Internet Standard 68&quot; (&quot;STD 68&quot;, type case sic), which was , and it often serves as the definition language for IETF communication protocols.

 supersedes . updates it, adding a syntax for specifying case-sensitive string literals.

==Overview==

An ABNF specification is a set of derivation rules, written as

where rule is a case-insensitive nonterminal, the definition consists of sequences of symbols that define the rule, a comment for documentation, and ending with a carriage return and line feed.

Rule names are case-insensitive: codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4 all refer to the same rule. Rule names consist of a letter followed by letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Angle brackets (codice_5, codice_6) are not required around rule names (as they are in BNF). However, they may be used to delimit a rule name when used in prose to discern a rule name.

==Terminal values==

Terminals are specified by one or more numeric characters.

Numeric characters may be specified as the percent sign codice_7, followed by the base (codice_8 = binary, codice_9 = decimal, and codice_10 = hexadecimal), followed by the value, or concatenation of values (indicated by codice_11). For example, a carriage return is specified by codice_12 in decimal or codice_13 in hexadecimal. A carriage return followed by a line feed may be specified with concatenation as codice_14.

Literal text is specified through the use of a string enclosed in quotation marks (codice_15). These strings are case-insensitive, and the character set used is (US-)ASCII. Therefore, the string codice_16 will match “abc”, “Abc”, “aBc”, “abC”, “ABc”, “AbC”, “aBC”, and “ABC”. RFC 7405 added a syntax for case-sensitive strings: codice_17 will only match &quot;aBc&quot;. Prior to that, a case-sensitive string could only be specified by listing the individual characters: to match “aBc”, the definition would be codice_18. A string can also be explicitly specified as case-insensitive with a codice_19 prefix.

==Operators==

===White space===
White space is used to separate elements of a definition; for space to be recognized as a delimiter, it must be explicitly included. The explicit reference for a single whitespace character is codice_20 (linear white space), and codice_21 is for zero or more whitespace characters with newlines permitted. The codice_21 definition in RFC5234 is controversial because at least one whitespace character is needed to form a delimiter between two fields.

Definitions are left-aligned. When multiple lines are required (for readability), continuation lines are indented by whitespace.

===Comment===
codice_23

A semicolon (codice_24) starts a comment that continues to the end of the line.

===Concatenation===
codice_25

A rule may be defined by listing a sequence of rule names.

To match the string “aba”, the following rules could be used:
* 

===Alternative===
codice_26

A rule may be defined by a list of alternative rules separated by a solidus (codice_27).

To accept the rule &quot;fu&quot; or the rule &quot;bar&quot;, the following rule could be constructed:

===Incremental alternatives===
codice_28

Additional alternatives may be added to a rule through the use of codice_29 between the rule name and the definition.

The rule
* 
is therefore equivalent to 

===Value range===
codice_30

A range of numeric values may be specified through the use of a hyphen (codice_31).

The rule
is equivalent to

===Sequence group===
codice_32

Elements may be placed in parentheses to group rules in a definition.

To match &quot;a b d&quot; or &quot;a c d&quot;, the following rule could be constructed:

To match “a b” or “c d”, the following rules could be constructed:
* 

===Variable repetition===
codice_33

To indicate repetition of an element, the form codice_34 is used. The optional codice_35 gives the minimal number of elements to be included (with the default of 0). The optional codice_36 gives the maximal number of elements to be included (with the default of infinity).

Use codice_37 for zero or more elements, codice_38 for zero or one element, codice_39 for one or more elements, and codice_40 for two or three elements, cf. regular expressions codice_41, codice_42, codice_43 and codice_44.

===Specific repetition===
codice_45

To indicate an explicit number of elements, the form codice_46 is used and is equivalent to codice_47.

Use codice_48 to get two numeric digits, and codice_49 to get three numeric digits. (codice_50 is defined below under &quot;Core rules&quot;. Also see &quot;zip-code&quot; in the example below.)

===Optional sequence===
codice_51

To indicate an optional element, the following constructions are equivalent:
* 

===Operator precedence===
The following operators have the given precedence from tightest binding to loosest binding:
#Strings, names formation
#Comment
#Value range
#Repetition
#Grouping, optional
#Concatenation
#Alternative

Use of the alternative operator with concatenation may be confusing, and it is recommended that grouping be used to make explicit concatenation groups.

===Core rules===

The core rules are defined in the ABNF standard.
Note that in the core rules diagram the CHAR2 charset is inlined in char-val and CHAR3 is inlined in prose-val in the RFC spec. They are named here for clarity in the main syntax diagram.

==Example==
The (U.S.) postal address example given in the augmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF) page may be specified as follows:

postal-address = name-part street zip-part

name-part = *(personal-part SP) last-name [SP suffix] CRLF
name-part =/ personal-part CRLF

personal-part = first-name / (initial &quot;.&quot;)
first-name = *ALPHA
initial = ALPHA
last-name = *ALPHA
suffix = (&quot;Jr.&quot; / &quot;Sr.&quot; / 1*(&quot;I&quot; / &quot;V&quot; / &quot;X&quot;))

street = [apt SP] house-num SP street-name CRLF
apt = 1*4DIGIT
house-num = 1*8(DIGIT / ALPHA)
street-name = 1*VCHAR

zip-part = town-name &quot;,&quot; SP state 1*2SP zip-code CRLF
town-name = 1*(ALPHA / SP)
state = 2ALPHA
zip-code = 5DIGIT [&quot;-&quot; 4DIGIT]
==Pitfalls==

RFC 5234 adds a warning in conjunction to the definition of LWSP as follows:

<doc id="60478" wikidata="Q15117556" url="?curid=60478" title="Abort (computing)">
<text>In a computer or data transmission system, to abort means to , usually in a controlled manner, a processing activity because it is impossible or undesirable for the activity to proceed or in conjunction with an error. Such an action may be accompanied by information on the aborted process.

In addition to being a verb, abort also has two noun senses. In the most general case, the event of aborting can be referred to as an abort. Sometimes the event of aborting can be given a special name, as in the case of an abort involving a Unix kernel where it is known as a kernel panic. Specifically in the context of data transmission, an abort is a function invoked by a sending station to cause the recipient to discard or ignore all bit sequences transmitted by the sender since the preceding flag sequence.

In the C programming language, codice_1 is a standard library function that terminates the current application and returns an error code to the host environment.

== Types of aborts ==

# User-Initiated Aborts: Users can often abort tasks using keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl + C in terminal applications) or commands to terminate processes. This is especially useful for stopping unresponsive programs or those taking longer than expected to execute.
# Programmatic Aborts: Developers can implement abort logic in their code. For instance, when a program encounters an error or invalid input, it may call functions like codice_1 in C or C++ to terminate execution. This approach helps prevent further errors or potential data corruption.
# System-Level Aborts: Operating systems might automatically abort processes under certain conditions, such as resource exhaustion or unresponsiveness. For example, a watchdog timer can terminate a process that remains idle beyond a specified time limit.
# Database Transactions: In database management, aborting (often termed ‘rolling back’) a transaction is crucial for maintaining data integrity. If a transaction cannot be completed successfully, aborting it returns the database to its previous state, which ensures that incomplete transactions don’t leave the data inconsistent.

Aborts are typically logged, especially in critical systems, to facilitate troubleshooting and improve future runs.

<doc id="60481" wikidata="Q3304290" url="?curid=60481" title="Alternating bit protocol">
<text>Alternating bit protocol (ABP) is a simple network protocol operating at the data link layer (OSI layer 2) that retransmits lost or corrupted messages using FIFO semantics. It can be seen as a special case of a sliding window protocol where a simple timer restricts the order of messages to ensure receivers send messages in turn while using a window of 1 bit.

== Design ==
Messages are sent from transmitter A to receiver B. Assume that the channel from A to B is initialized and that there are no messages in transit. Each message from A to B contains a data part and a one-bit sequence number, i.e., a value that is 0 or 1. B has two acknowledge codes that it can send to A: ACK0 and ACK1.

When A sends a message, it resends it continuously, with the same sequence number, until it receives an acknowledgment from B that contains the same sequence number. When that happens, A complements (flips) the sequence number and starts transmitting the next message.

When B receives a message that is not corrupted and has sequence number 0, it starts sending ACK0 and keeps doing so until it receives a valid message with number 1. Then it starts sending ACK1, etc.

This means that A may still receive ACK0 when it is already transmitting messages with sequence number one. (And vice versa.) It treats such messages as negative-acknowledge codes (NAKs). The simplest behaviour is to ignore them all and continue transmitting.

The protocol may be initialized by sending bogus messages and acks with sequence number 1. The first message with sequence number 0 is a real message.

=== Bounded Retransmission Protocol ===
Bounded Retransmission Protocol (BRP) is a variant of the alternating bit protocol introduced by Philips. The service it delivers is to transfer in a reliable manner, if possible, large files (sequence of data of arbitrary length) from a sender to a receiver. Unlike ABP, BRP deals with sequence numbers of datum in the file and interrupts transfer after fixed number of retransmissions for a datum.

== History ==
Donald Davies&#x27; team at the National Physical Laboratory introduced the concept of an alternating bit protocol in 1968 for the NPL network. An ABP was used by the ARPANET and by the European Informatics Network.

<doc id="60486" wikidata="Q4826545" url="?curid=60486" title="Automatic baud rate detection">
<text>Automatic baud rate detection (ABR, autobaud) refers to the process by which a receiving device (such as a modem) determines the speed, code level, start bit, and stop bits of incoming data by examining the first character, usually a preselected sign-on character (syncword) on a UART connection. ABR allows the receiving device to accept data from a variety of transmitting devices operating at different speeds without needing to establish data rates in advance.

==Process==
During the autobaud process, the baud rate of received character stream is determined by examining the received pattern and its timing, and the length of a start bit. These type of baud rate detection mechanism are supported by many hardware chips including processors such as STM32 MPC8280, MPC8360, and so on. 

When start bit length is used to determine the baud rate, it requires the character to be odd since UART sends LSB bit firstthis particular bit order scheme is referred to as little-endian. Often symbols &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;A&#x27; (0x61 or 0x41) are used. For example, the MPC8270 SCC tries to detect the length of the UART start bit for autobaud.

Many protocols begin each frame with a preamble of alternating 1 and 0 bits that can be used for automatic baud rate detection. For example, the TI PGA460 uses a &#x27;U&#x27; ( 0x55 ) sync byte for automatic baud rate detection as well as frame synchronization, and so does the LIN header (Local Interconnect Network#Header).

For example, the UART-based FlexWire protocol begins each frame with a &#x27;U&#x27; (0x55) sync byte. FlexWire receivers use the sync byte to precisely set their UART bit-clock frequency without a high-precision oscillator. For example, the Ethernet preamble contains 56 bits of alternating 1 and 0 bits for synchronizing bit clocks.

==Support==
Most modems currently on the market support autobaud. Before receiving any input data, most modems use a default baud rate of 9600 for output. For example, the following modems have been verified for autobaud and default output baud rate 9600: 
* USRobotics USR5686G 56K Serial Controller Fax modem
* Hayes V92 External modem
* Microcom DeskPorte 28.8P

<text>In mathematics, the abscissa (; plural &quot;abscissae&quot; or &quot;abscissas&quot;) and the ordinate are respectively the first and second coordinate of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system:
: abscissa formula_1-axis (horizontal) coordinate
: ordinate formula_2-axis (vertical) coordinate

Together they form an ordered pair which defines the location of a point in two-dimensional rectangular space.

More technically, the abscissa of a point is the signed measure of its projection on the primary axis. Its absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and its sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive). Similarly, the ordinate of a point is the signed measure of its projection on the secondary axis. In three dimensions, the third direction is sometimes referred to as the &quot;&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Though the word &quot;abscissa&quot; () has been used at least since &quot;De Practica Geometrie&quot; (1220) by Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa), its use in its modern sense may be due to Venetian mathematician Stefano degli Angeli in his work &quot;Miscellaneum Hyperbolicum, et Parabolicum&quot; (1659). Historically, the term was used in the more general sense of a &#x27;distance&#x27;.

In his 1892 work &quot; (&quot;Lectures on history of mathematics&quot;&quot;), volume 2, German historian of mathematics Moritz Cantor writes:
At the same time it was presumably by [Stefano degli Angeli] that a word was introduced into the mathematical vocabulary for which especially in analytic geometry the future proved to have much in store. […] We know of no earlier use of the word &quot;abscissa&quot; in Latin original texts. Maybe the word appears in translations of the Apollonian conics, where [in] Book I, Chapter 20 there is mention of &quot;ἀποτεμνομέναις,&quot; for which there would hardly be a more appropriate Latin word than .
The use of the word &quot;ordinate&quot; is related to the Latin phrase &quot;linea ordinata appliicata&quot; &#x27;line applied parallel&#x27;.

==In parametric equations==
In a somewhat obsolete variant usage, the abscissa of a point may also refer to any number that describes the point&#x27;s location along some path, e.g. the parameter of a parametric equation. Used in this way, the abscissa can be thought of as a coordinate-geometry analog to the independent variable in a mathematical model or experiment (with any ordinates filling a role analogous to dependent variables).

<doc id="60490" wikidata="Q333341" url="?curid=60490" title="Abstract interpretation">
<text>In computer science, abstract interpretation is a theory of sound approximation of the semantics of computer programs, based on monotonic functions over ordered sets, especially lattices. It can be viewed as a partial execution of a computer program which gains information about its semantics (e.g., control-flow, data-flow) without performing all the calculations.

Its main concrete application is formal static analysis, the automatic extraction of information about the possible executions of computer programs; such analyses have two main usages:
* inside compilers, to analyse programs to decide whether certain optimizations or transformations are applicable;
* for debugging or even the certification of programs against classes of bugs.

Abstract interpretation was formalized by the French computer scientist working couple Patrick Cousot and Radhia Cousot in the late 1970s.

==Intuition==
This section illustrates abstract interpretation by means of real-world, non-computing examples.

Consider the people in a conference room. Assume a unique identifier for each person in the room, like a social security number in the United States. To prove that someone is not present, all one needs to do is see if their social security number is not on the list. Since two different people cannot have the same number, it is possible to prove or disprove the presence of a participant simply by looking up their number.

However it is possible that only the names of attendees were registered. If the name of a person is not found in the list, we may safely conclude that that person was not present; but if it is, we cannot conclude definitely without further inquiries, due to the possibility of homonyms (for example, two people named John Smith). Note that this imprecise information will still be adequate for most purposes, because homonyms are rare in practice. However, in all rigor, we cannot say for sure that somebody was present in the room; all we can say is that they were &quot;possibly&quot; here. If the person we are looking up is a criminal, we will issue an &quot;alarm&quot;; but there is of course the possibility of issuing a &quot;false alarm&quot;. Similar phenomena will occur in the analysis of programs.

If we are only interested in some specific information, say, &quot;was there a person of age formula_1 in the room?&quot;, keeping a list of all names and dates of births is unnecessary. We may safely and without loss of precision restrict ourselves to keeping a list of the participants&#x27; ages. If this is already too much to handle, we might keep only the age of the youngest, formula_2 and oldest person, formula_3. If the question is about an age strictly lower than formula_2 or strictly higher than formula_3, then we may safely respond that no such participant was present. Otherwise, we may only be able to say that we do not know.

In the case of computing, concrete, precise information is in general not computable within finite time and memory (see Rice&#x27;s theorem and the halting problem). Abstraction is used to allow for generalized answers to questions (for example, answering &quot;maybe&quot; to a yes/no question, meaning &quot;yes or no&quot;, when we (an algorithm of abstract interpretation) cannot compute the precise answer with certainty); this simplifies the problems, making them amenable to automatic solutions. One crucial requirement is to add enough vagueness so as to make problems manageable while still retaining enough precision for answering the important questions (such as &quot;might the program crash?&quot;).

== Abstract interpretation of computer programs ==

Given a programming or specification language, abstract interpretation consists of giving several semantics linked by relations of abstraction. A semantics is a mathematical characterization of a possible behavior of the program. The most precise semantics, describing very closely the actual execution of the program, are called the &quot;concrete semantics&quot;. For instance, the concrete semantics of an imperative programming language may associate to each program the set of execution traces it may produce – an execution trace being a sequence of possible consecutive states of the execution of the program; a state typically consists of the value of the program counter and the memory locations (globals, stack and heap). More abstract semantics are then derived; for instance, one may consider only the set of reachable states in the executions (which amounts to considering the last states in finite traces).

The goal of static analysis is to derive a computable semantic interpretation at some point. For instance, one may choose to represent the state of a program manipulating integer variables by forgetting the actual values of the variables and only keeping their signs (+, − or 0). For some elementary operations, such as multiplication, such an abstraction does not lose any precision: to get the sign of a product, it is sufficient to know the sign of the operands. For some other operations, the abstraction may lose precision: for instance, it is impossible to know the sign of a sum whose operands are respectively positive and negative.

Sometimes a loss of precision is necessary to make the semantics decidable (see Rice&#x27;s theorem and the halting problem). In general, there is a compromise to be made between the precision of the analysis and its decidability (computability), or tractability (computational cost).

In practice the abstractions that are defined are tailored to both the program properties one desires to analyze, and to the set of target programs. The first large scale automated analysis of computer programs with abstract interpretation was motivated by the accident that resulted in the destruction of the first flight of the Ariane 5 rocket in 1996.

== Formalization ==
Let formula_6 be an ordered set, called &quot;concrete set&quot;, and let formula_7 be another ordered set, called &quot;abstract set&quot;. These two sets are related to each other by defining total functions that map elements from one to the other.

A function formula_8 is called an &quot;abstraction function&quot; if it maps an element formula_9 in the concrete set formula_6 to an element formula_11 in the abstract set formula_7. That is, element formula_11 in formula_7 is the &quot;abstraction&quot; of formula_9 in formula_6.

A function formula_17 is called a &quot;concretization function&quot; if it maps an element formula_18 in the abstract set formula_7 to an element formula_20 in the concrete set formula_6. That is, element formula_20 in formula_6 is a &quot;concretization&quot; of formula_18 in formula_7.

Let formula_26, formula_27, formula_28, and formula_29 be ordered sets. The concrete semantics formula_30 is a monotonic function from formula_26 to formula_27. A function formula_33 from formula_28 to formula_29 is said to be a &quot;valid abstraction&quot; of formula_30 if, for all formula_18 in formula_28, we have formula_39.

Program semantics are generally described using fixed points in the presence of loops or recursive procedures. Suppose that formula_6 is a complete lattice and let formula_30 be a monotonic function from formula_6 into formula_6. Then, any formula_18 such that formula_45 is an abstraction of the least fixed-point of formula_30, which exists, according to the Knaster–Tarski theorem.

The difficulty is now to obtain such an formula_18. If formula_7 is of finite height, or at least verifies the ascending chain condition (all ascending sequences are ultimately stationary), then such an formula_18 may be obtained as the stationary limit of the ascending sequence formula_50 defined by induction as follows: formula_51 (the least element of formula_7) and formula_53.

In other cases, it is still possible to obtain such an formula_18 through a (pair-)widening operator, defined as a binary operator formula_55 which satisfies the following conditions:

# For all formula_9 and formula_57, we have formula_58 and formula_59, and
# For any ascending sequence formula_60, the sequence defined by formula_61 and formula_62 is ultimately stationary. We can then take formula_63.

In some cases, it is possible to define abstractions using Galois connections formula_64 where formula_8 is from formula_6 to formula_7 and formula_17 is from formula_7 to formula_6. This supposes the existence of best abstractions, which is not necessarily the case. For instance, if we abstract sets of couples formula_71 of real numbers by enclosing convex polyhedra, there is no optimal abstraction to the disc defined by formula_72.

==Examples of abstract domains==

===Numerical abstract domains===

One can assign to each variable formula_9 available at a given program point an interval formula_74. A state assigning the value formula_75 to variable formula_9 will be a concretization of these intervals if, for all formula_9, we have formula_78. From the intervals formula_74 and formula_80 for variables formula_9 and formula_57, respectively, one can easily obtain intervals for formula_83 (namely, formula_84) and for formula_85 (namely, formula_86); note that these are &quot;exact&quot; abstractions, since the set of possible outcomes for, say, formula_87, is precisely the interval formula_84. More complex formulas can be derived for multiplication, division, etc., yielding so-called interval arithmetics.

Let us now consider the following very simple program:

With reasonable arithmetic types, the result for should be zero. But if we do interval arithmetic starting from in [0, 1], one gets in [−1, +1]. While each of the operations taken individually was exactly abstracted, their composition isn&#x27;t.

The problem is evident: we did not keep track of the equality relationship between and ; actually, this domain of intervals does not take into account any relationships between variables, and is thus a &quot;non-relational domain&quot;. Non-relational domains tend to be fast and simple to implement, but imprecise.

Some examples of &quot;relational&quot; numerical abstract domains are:
* congruence relations on integers
* convex polyhedra (cf. left picture) – with some high computational costs
* difference-bound matrices
* &quot;octagons&quot;
* linear equalities
and combinations thereof (such as the reduced product, cf. right picture).

When one chooses an abstract domain, one typically has to strike a balance between keeping fine-grained relationships, and high computational costs.

===Machine word abstract domains===

While high-level languages such as Python or Haskell use unbounded integers by default, lower-level programming languages such as C or assembly language typically operate on finitely-sized machine words, which are more suitably modeled using the integers modulo formula_89 (where &quot;n&quot; is the bit width of a machine word). There are several abstract domains suitable for various analyses of such variables.

The &quot;bitfield domain&quot; treats each bit in a machine word separately, i.e., a word of width &quot;n&quot; is treated as an array of &quot;n&quot; abstract values. The abstract values are taken from the set formula_90, and the abstraction and concretization functions are given by: formula_91, formula_92, formula_93, formula_94, formula_95, formula_96, formula_97. Bitwise operations on these abstract values are identical with the corresponding logical operations in some three-valued logics:

Further domains include the &quot;signed interval domain&quot; and the &quot;unsigned interval domain&quot;. All three of these domains support forwards and backwards abstract operators for common operations such as addition, shifts, xor, and multiplication. These domains can be combined using the reduced product.

<text>In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is the process of generalizing concrete details, such as attributes, away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance. Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering, especially within the object-oriented programming paradigm. Examples of this include:

* the usage of abstract data types to separate usage from working representations of data within programs;
* the concept of functions or subroutines which represent a specific way of implementing control flow;
* the process of reorganizing common behavior from groups of non-abstract classes into abstract classes using inheritance and sub-classes, as seen in object-oriented programming languages.

==Rationale==
Computing mostly operates independently of the concrete world. The hardware implements a model of computation that is interchangeable with others. The software is structured in architectures to enable humans to create the enormous systems by concentrating on a few issues at a time. These architectures are made of specific choices of abstractions. Greenspun&#x27;s tenth rule is an aphorism on how such an architecture is both inevitable and complex.

Language abstraction is a central form of abstraction in computing: new artificial languages are developed to express specific aspects of a system. &quot;Modeling languages&quot; help in planning. &quot;Computer languages&quot; can be processed with a computer. An example of this abstraction process is the generational development of programming language from the first-generation programming language (machine language) to the second-generation programming language (assembly language) and the third-generation programming language (high-level programming language). Each stage can be used as a stepping stone for the next stage. The language abstraction continues for example in scripting languages and domain-specific languages.

Within a programming language, some features let the programmer create new abstractions. These include subroutines, modules, polymorphism, and software components. Some other abstractions such as software design patterns and architectural styles remain invisible to a translator and operate only in the design of a system.

Some abstractions try to limit the range of concepts a programmer needs to be aware of, by completely hiding the abstractions they are built on. The software engineer and writer Joel Spolsky has criticized these efforts by claiming that all abstractions are &quot;leaky&quot; – that they can never completely hide the details below; however, this does not negate the usefulness of abstraction.

Some abstractions are designed to inter-operate with other abstractions – for example, a programming language may contain a foreign function interface for making calls to the lower-level language.

==Abstraction features==

===Programming languages===
Different programming languages provide different types of abstraction, depending on the intended applications for the language. For example:

* In object-oriented programming languages such as C++, Object Pascal, or Java, the concept of &quot;abstraction&quot; has become a declarative statement – using the syntax codice_1 (in C++) or the reserved words (keywords) &quot;codice_2&quot; and &quot;codice_3&quot; (in Java). After such a declaration, it is the responsibility of the programmer to implement a class to instantiate the object of the declaration.
* Functional programming languages commonly exhibit abstractions related to functions, such as lambda abstractions (making a term into a function of some variable) and higher-order functions (parameters are functions).
* Modern members of the Lisp programming language family such as Clojure, Scheme and Common Lisp support macro systems to allow syntactic abstraction. Other programming languages such as Scala also have macros, or very similar metaprogramming features (for example, Haskell has Template Haskell, OCaml has MetaOCaml). These can allow programs to omit boilerplate code, abstract away tedious function call sequences, implement new control flow structures, and implement domain-specific languages (DSLs), which allow domain-specific concepts to be expressed in concise and elegant ways. All of these, when used correctly, improve both the programmer&#x27;s efficiency and the clarity of source code by making the intended purpose more explicit. A consequence of syntactic abstraction is also that any Lisp dialect, and almost any programming language, can in principle, be implemented in any modern Lisp with significantly reduced (but still non-trivial in most cases) effort when compared to &quot;more traditional&quot; programming languages such as Python, C or Java.

===Specification methods===
Analysts have developed various methods to formally specify software systems. Some known methods include:

* Abstract-model based method (VDM, Z);
* Algebraic techniques (Larch, CLEAR, OBJ, ACT ONE, CASL);
* Process-based techniques (LOTOS, SDL, Estelle);
* Trace-based techniques (SPECIAL, TAM);
* Knowledge-based techniques (Refine, Gist).

===Specification languages===
Specification languages generally rely on abstractions of one kind or another, since specifications are typically defined earlier in a project, (and at a more abstract level) than an eventual implementation. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) specification language, for example, allows the definition of &quot;abstract&quot; classes, which in a waterfall project, remain abstract during the architecture and specification phase of the project.

==Control abstraction==
Programming languages offer control abstraction as one of the main purposes of their use. Computer machines understand operations at the very low level such as moving some bits from one location of the memory to another location and producing the sum of two sequences of bits. Programming languages allow this to be done in the higher level. For example, consider this statement written in a Pascal-like fashion:

:codice_4

To a human, this seems a fairly simple and obvious calculation (&quot;one plus two is three, times five is fifteen&quot;). However, the low-level steps necessary to carry out this evaluation, and return the value &quot;15&quot;, and then assign that value to the variable &quot;a&quot;, are actually quite subtle and complex. The values need to be converted to binary representation (often a much more complicated task than one would think) and the calculations decomposed (by the compiler or interpreter) into assembly instructions (again, which are much less intuitive to the programmer: operations such as shifting a binary register left, or adding the binary complement of the contents of one register to another, are simply not how humans think about the abstract arithmetical operations of addition or multiplication). Finally, assigning the resulting value of &quot;15&quot; to the variable labeled &quot;a&quot;, so that &quot;a&quot; can be used later, involves additional &#x27;behind-the-scenes&#x27; steps of looking up a variable&#x27;s label and the resultant location in physical or virtual memory, storing the binary representation of &quot;15&quot; to that memory location, etc.

Without control abstraction, a programmer would need to specify &quot;all&quot; the register/binary-level steps each time they simply wanted to add or multiply a couple of numbers and assign the result to a variable. Such duplication of effort has two serious negative consequences:

# it forces the programmer to constantly repeat fairly common tasks every time a similar operation is needed
# it forces the programmer to program for the particular hardware and instruction set

===Structured programming===
Structured programming involves the splitting of complex program tasks into smaller pieces with clear flow-control and interfaces between components, with a reduction of the complexity potential for side-effects.

In a simple program, this may aim to ensure that loops have single or obvious exit points and (where possible) to have single exit points from functions and procedures.

In a larger system, it may involve breaking down complex tasks into many different modules. Consider a system which handles payroll on ships and at shore offices:

* The uppermost level may feature a menu of typical end-user operations.
* Within that could be standalone executables or libraries for tasks such as signing on and off employees or printing checks.
* Within each of those standalone components there could be many different source files, each containing the program code to handle a part of the problem, with only selected interfaces available to other parts of the program. A sign on program could have source files for each data entry screen and the database interface (which may itself be a standalone third party library or a statically linked set of library routines).
*Either the database or the payroll application also has to initiate the process of exchanging data with between ship and shore, and that data transfer task will often contain many other components.

These layers produce the effect of isolating the implementation details of one component and its assorted internal methods from the others. Object-oriented programming embraces and extends this concept.

==Data abstraction==
Data abstraction enforces a clear separation between the &quot;abstract&quot; properties of a data type and the &quot;concrete&quot; details of its implementation. The abstract properties are those that are visible to client code that makes use of the data type—the &quot;interface&quot; to the data type—while the concrete implementation is kept entirely private, and indeed can change, for example to incorporate efficiency improvements over time. The idea is that such changes are not supposed to have any impact on client code, since they involve no difference in the abstract behaviour.

For example, one could define an abstract data type called &quot;lookup table&quot; which uniquely associates &quot;keys&quot; with &quot;values&quot;, and in which values may be retrieved by specifying their corresponding keys. Such a lookup table may be implemented in various ways: as a hash table, a binary search tree, or even a simple linear list of (key:value) pairs. As far as client code is concerned, the abstract properties of the type are the same in each case.

Of course, this all relies on getting the details of the interface right in the first place, since any changes there can have major impacts on client code. As one way to look at this: the interface forms a &quot;contract&quot; on agreed behaviour between the data type and client code; anything not spelled out in the contract is subject to change without notice.

== Manual data abstraction ==
While much of data abstraction occurs through computer science and automation, there are times when this process is done manually and without programming intervention. One way this can be understood is through data abstraction within the process of conducting a systematic review of the literature. In this methodology, data is abstracted by one or several abstractors when conducting a meta-analysis, with errors reduced through dual data abstraction followed by independent checking, known as adjudication.

==Abstraction in object oriented programming==
In object-oriented programming theory, &quot;abstraction&quot; involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract &quot;actors&quot; that can perform work, report on and change their state, and &quot;communicate&quot; with other objects in the system. The term encapsulation refers to the hiding of state details, but extending the concept of &quot;data type&quot; from earlier programming languages to associate &quot;behavior&quot; most strongly with the data, and standardizing the way that different data types interact, is the beginning of &quot;abstraction&quot;. When abstraction proceeds into the operations defined, enabling objects of different types to be substituted, it is called polymorphism. When it proceeds in the opposite direction, inside the types or classes, structuring them to simplify a complex set of relationships, it is called delegation or inheritance.

Various object-oriented programming languages offer similar facilities for abstraction, all to support a general strategy of polymorphism in object-oriented programming, which includes the substitution of one data type for another in the same or similar role. Although not as generally supported, a configuration or image or package may predetermine a great many of these bindings at compile time, link time, or load time. This would leave only a minimum of such bindings to change at run-time.

Common Lisp Object System or Self, for example, feature less of a class-instance distinction and more use of delegation for polymorphism. Individual objects and functions are abstracted more flexibly to better fit with a shared functional heritage from Lisp.

C++ exemplifies another extreme: it relies heavily on templates and overloading and other static bindings at compile-time, which in turn has certain flexibility problems.

Although these examples offer alternate strategies for achieving the same abstraction, they do not fundamentally alter the need to support abstract nouns in code – all programming relies on an ability to abstract verbs as functions, nouns as data structures, and either as processes.

Consider for example a sample Java fragment to represent some common farm &quot;animals&quot; to a level of abstraction suitable to model simple aspects of their hunger and feeding. It defines an codice_5 class to represent both the state of the animal and its functions:
public class Animal extends LivingThing
 private Location loc;
 private double energyReserves;

 public boolean isHungry() {
 return energyReserves &lt; 2.5;
 public void eat(Food food) {
 // Consume food
 energyReserves += food.getCalories();
 public void moveTo(Location location) {
 // Move to new location
 this.loc = location;
}

With the above definition, one could create objects of type and call their methods like this:
thePig = new Animal();
theCow = new Animal();
if (thePig.isHungry()) {
 thePig.eat(tableScraps);
if (theCow.isHungry()) {
 theCow.eat(grass);
theCow.moveTo(theBarn);

In the above example, the class &quot;codice_5&quot; is an abstraction used in place of an actual animal, &quot;codice_7&quot; is a further abstraction (in this case a generalisation) of &quot;codice_5&quot;.

If one requires a more differentiated hierarchy of animals – to differentiate, say, those who provide milk from those who provide nothing except meat at the end of their lives – that is an intermediary level of abstraction, probably DairyAnimal (cows, goats) who would eat foods suitable to giving good milk, and MeatAnimal (pigs, steers) who would eat foods to give the best meat-quality.

Such an abstraction could remove the need for the application coder to specify the type of food, so they could concentrate instead on the feeding schedule. The two classes could be related using inheritance or stand alone, and the programmer could define varying degrees of polymorphism between the two types. These facilities tend to vary drastically between languages, but in general each can achieve anything that is possible with any of the others. A great many operation overloads, data type by data type, can have the same effect at compile-time as any degree of inheritance or other means to achieve polymorphism. The class notation is simply a coder&#x27;s convenience.

===Object-oriented design===
Decisions regarding what to abstract and what to keep under the control of the coder become the major concern of object-oriented design and domain analysis—actually determining the relevant relationships in the real world is the concern of object-oriented analysis or legacy analysis.

In general, to determine appropriate abstraction, one must make many small decisions about scope (domain analysis), determine what other systems one must cooperate with (legacy analysis), then perform a detailed object-oriented analysis which is expressed within project time and budget constraints as an object-oriented design. In our simple example, the domain is the barnyard, the live pigs and cows and their eating habits are the legacy constraints, the detailed analysis is that coders must have the flexibility to feed the animals what is available and thus there is no reason to code the type of food into the class itself, and the design is a single simple Animal class of which pigs and cows are instances with the same functions. A decision to differentiate DairyAnimal would change the detailed analysis but the domain and legacy analysis would be unchanged—thus it is entirely under the control of the programmer, and it is called an abstraction in object-oriented programming as distinct from abstraction in domain or legacy analysis.

==Considerations==
When discussing formal semantics of programming languages, formal methods or abstract interpretation, &quot;abstraction&quot; refers to the act of considering a less detailed, but safe, definition of the observed program behaviors. For instance, one may observe only the final result of program executions instead of considering all the intermediate steps of executions. Abstraction is defined to a &quot;concrete&quot; (more precise) model of execution.

Abstraction may be &quot;exact&quot; or &quot;faithful&quot; with respect to a property if one can answer a question about the property equally well on the concrete or abstract model. For instance, if one wishes to know what the result of the evaluation of a mathematical expression involving only integers +, -, ×, is worth modulo &quot;n&quot;, then one needs only perform all operations modulo &quot;n&quot; (a familiar form of this abstraction is casting out nines).

Abstractions, however, though not necessarily &quot;exact&quot;, should be &quot;sound&quot;. That is, it should be possible to get sound answers from them—even though the abstraction may simply yield a result of undecidability. For instance, students in a class may be abstracted by their minimal and maximal ages; if one asks whether a certain person belongs to that class, one may simply compare that person&#x27;s age with the minimal and maximal ages; if his age lies outside the range, one may safely answer that the person does not belong to the class; if it does not, one may only answer &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;.

The level of abstraction included in a programming language can influence its overall usability. The Cognitive dimensions framework includes the concept of &quot;abstraction gradient&quot; in a formalism. This framework allows the designer of a programming language to study the trade-offs between abstraction and other characteristics of the design, and how changes in abstraction influence the language usability.

Abstractions can prove useful when dealing with computer programs, because non-trivial properties of computer programs are essentially undecidable (see Rice&#x27;s theorem). As a consequence, automatic methods for deriving information on the behavior of computer programs either have to drop termination (on some occasions, they may fail, crash or never yield out a result), soundness (they may provide false information), or precision (they may answer &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; to some questions).

Abstraction is the core concept of abstract interpretation. Model checking generally takes place on abstract versions of the studied systems.

==Levels of abstraction==
Computer science commonly presents &quot;levels&quot; (or, less commonly, &quot;layers&quot;) of abstraction, wherein each level represents a different model of the same information and processes, but with varying amounts of detail. Each level uses a system of expression involving a unique set of objects and compositions that apply only to a particular domain.

Each relatively abstract, &quot;higher&quot; level builds on a relatively concrete, &quot;lower&quot; level, which tends to provide an increasingly &quot;granular&quot; representation. For example, gates build on electronic circuits, binary on gates, machine language on binary, programming language on machine language, applications and operating systems on programming languages. Each level is embodied, but not determined, by the level beneath it, making it a language of description that is somewhat self-contained.

===Database systems===
Since many users of database systems lack in-depth familiarity with computer data-structures, database developers often hide complexity through the following levels:

&quot;Physical level&quot; – The lowest level of abstraction describes &quot;how&quot; a system actually stores data. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail.

&quot;Logical level&quot; – The next higher level of abstraction describes &quot;what&quot; data the database stores, and what relationships exist among those data. The logical level thus describes an entire database in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures. Although implementation of the simple structures at the logical level may involve complex physical level structures, the user of the logical level does not need to be aware of this complexity. This is referred to as physical data independence. Database administrators, who must decide what information to keep in a database, use the logical level of abstraction.

&quot;View level&quot; – The highest level of abstraction describes only part of the entire database. Even though the logical level uses simpler structures, complexity remains because of the variety of information stored in a large database. Many users of a database system do not need all this information; instead, they need to access only a part of the database. The view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interaction with the system. The system may provide many views for the same database.

===Layered architecture===

The ability to provide a design of different levels of abstraction can

* simplify the design considerably
* enable different role players to effectively work at various levels of abstraction
* support the portability of software artifacts (model-based ideally)

Systems design and business process design can both use this. Some design processes specifically generate designs that contain various levels of abstraction.

Layered architecture partitions the concerns of the application into stacked groups (layers).
It is a technique used in designing computer software, hardware, and communications in which system or network components are isolated in layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others.

<text>In computer science, an abstract machine is a theoretical model that allows for a detailed and precise analysis of how a computer system functions. It is similar to a mathematical function in that it receives inputs and produces outputs based on predefined rules. Abstract machines vary from literal machines in that they are expected to perform correctly and independently of hardware. Abstract machines are &quot;machines&quot; because they allow step-by-step execution of programs; they are &quot;abstract&quot; because they ignore many aspects of actual (hardware) machines. A typical abstract machine consists of a definition in terms of input, output, and the set of allowable operations used to turn the former into the latter. They can be used for purely theoretical reasons as well as models for real-world computer systems. In the theory of computation, abstract machines are often used in thought experiments regarding computability or to analyse the complexity of algorithms. This use of abstract machines is fundamental to the field of computational complexity theory, such as finite state machines, Mealy machines, push-down automata, and Turing machines.

== Classification ==
Abstract machines are typically categorized into two types based on the quantity of operations they can execute simultaneously at any given moment: deterministic abstract machines and non-deterministic abstract machines. A deterministic abstract machine is a system in which a particular beginning state or condition always yields the same outputs. There is no randomness or variation in how inputs are transformed into outputs. In contrast, a non-deterministic abstract machine can provide various outputs for the same input on different executions. Unlike a deterministic algorithm, which gives the same result for the same input regardless of the number of iterations, a non-deterministic algorithm takes various paths to arrive to different outputs. Non-deterministic algorithms are helpful for obtaining approximate answers when deriving a precise solution using a deterministic approach is difficult or costly.
Turing machines, for example, are some of the most fundamental abstract machines in computer science. These machines conduct operations on a tape (a string of symbols) of any length. Their instructions provide for both modifying the symbols and changing the symbol that the machine’s pointer is currently at. For example, a rudimentary Turing machine could have a single command, &quot;convert symbol to 1 then move right&quot;, and this machine would only produce a string of 1s. This basic Turing machine is deterministic; however, nondeterministic Turing machines that can execute several actions given the same input may also be built.

== Implementation ==
Any implementation of an abstract machine in the case of physical implementation (in hardware) uses some kind of physical device (mechanical or electronic) to execute the instructions of a programming language. An abstract machine, however, can also be implemented in software or firmware at levels between the abstract machine and underlying physical device. 

* Implementation in hardware: The direct implementation of abstract machine in hardware is a matter of using physical devices such as memory, arithmetic and logic circuits, buses, etc., to implement a physical machine whose machine language coincides with the programming language. Once constructed, it would be virtually hard to change such a machine. A CPU may be thought of as a concrete hardware realisation of an abstract machine, particularly the processor&#x27;s design.

* Simulation using software: Implementing an abstract machine with software entails writing programmes in a different language to implement the data structures and algorithms needed by the abstract machine. This provides the most flexibility since programmes implementing abstract machine constructs can be easily changed. An abstract machine implemented as a software simulation, or for which an interpreter exists, is called a virtual machine.

* Emulation using firmware: Firmware implementation sits between hardware and software implementation. It consists of microcode simulations of data structures and algorithms for abstract machines. Microcode allows a computer programmer to write machine instructions without needing to fabricate electrical circuitry.

== Programming language implementation ==
An abstract machine is, intuitively, just an abstraction of the idea of a physical computer. For actual execution, algorithms must be properly formalised using the constructs offered by a programming language. This implies that the algorithms to be executed must be expressed using programming language instructions. The syntax of a programming language enables the construction of programs using a finite set of constructs known as instructions. Most abstract machines share a program store and a state, which often includes a stack and registers. In digital computers, the stack is simply a memory unit with an address register that can count only positive integers (after an initial value is loaded into it). The address register for the stack is known as a stack pointer because its value always refers to the top item on the stack. The program consists of a series of instructions, with a stack pointer indicating the next instruction to be performed. When the instruction is completed, a stack pointer is advanced. This fundamental control mechanism of an abstract machine is also known as its execution loop. Thus, an abstract machine for a programming language is any collection of data structures and algorithms capable of storing and running programs written in the programming language. It bridges the gap between the high level of a programming language and the low level of an actual machine by providing an intermediate language step for compilation. An abstract machine&#x27;s instructions are adapted to the unique operations necessary to implement operations of a certain source language or set of source languages.

=== Imperative languages ===
In the late 1950s, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and other allied organisations developed many proposals for Universal Computer Oriented Language (UNCOL), such as Conway&#x27;s machine. The UNCOL concept is good, but it has not been widely used due to the poor performance of the generated code. In many areas of computing, its performance will continue to be an issue despite the development of the Java Virtual Machine in the late 1990s. Algol Object Code (1964), P4-machine (1976), UCSD P-machine (1977), and Forth (1970) are some successful abstract machines of this kind.

=== Object-oriented languages ===
Abstract machines for object-oriented programming languages are often stack-based and have special access instructions for object fields and methods. In these machines, memory management is often implicit performed by a garbage collector (memory recovery feature built into programming languages). Smalltalk-80 (1980), Self (1989), and Java (1994) are examples of this implementation. 

=== String processing languages ===
A string processing language is a computer language that focuses on processing strings rather than numbers. There have been string processing languages in the form of command shells, programming tools, macro processors, and scripting languages for decades. Using a suitable abstract machine has two benefits: increased execution speed and enhanced portability. Snobol4 and ML/I are two notable instances of early string processing languages that use an abstract machine to gain machine independence.

=== Functional programming languages ===
The early abstract machines for functional languages, including the SECD machine (1964) and Cardelli&#x27;s Functional Abstract Machine (1983), defined strict evaluation, also known as eager or call-by-value evaluation, in which function arguments are evaluated before the call and precisely once. Recently, the majority of research has been on lazy (or call-by-need) evaluation, such as the G-machine (1984), Krivine machine (1985), and Three Instruction Machine (1986), in which function arguments are evaluated only if necessary and at most once. One reason is because effective implementation of strict evaluation is now well-understood, therefore the necessity for an abstract machine has diminished.

=== Logical languages ===
Predicate calculus (first order logic) is the foundation of logic programming languages. The most well-known logic programming language is Prolog. The rules in Prolog are written in a uniform format known as universally quantified &#x27;Horn clauses&#x27;, which means to begin the calculation that attempts to discover a proof of the objective. The Warren Abstract Machine WAM (1983), which has become the de facto standard in Prolog program compilation, has been the focus of most study. It provides special purpose instructions such as data unification instructions and control flow instructions to support backtracking (searching algorithm).
== Structure ==
A generic abstract machine is made up of a memory and an interpreter. The memory is used to store data and programs, while the interpreter is the component that executes the instructions included in programs. 

The interpreter must carry out the operations that are unique to the language it is interpreting. However, given the variety of languages, it is conceivable to identify categories of operations and an &quot;execution mechanism&quot; shared by all interpreters. The interpreter&#x27;s operations and accompanying data structures are divided into the following categories:

# Operations for processing primitive data: 
# Operations and data structures for controlling the sequence of execution of operations;
# Operations and data structures for controlling data transfers;
# Operations and data structures for memory management.

=== Processing primitive data ===
An abstract machine must contain operations for manipulating primitive data types such as strings and integers. For example, integers are nearly universally considered a basic data type for both physical abstract machines and the abstract machines used by many programming languages. The machine carries out the arithmetic operations necessary, such as addition and multiplication, within a single time step.

=== Sequence control ===
Operations and structures for &quot;sequence control&quot; allow controlling the execution flow of program instructions. When certain conditions are met, it is necessary to change the typical sequential execution of a program. Therefore, the interpreter employs data structures (such as those used to store the address of the next instruction to execute) that are modified by operations distinct from those used for data manipulation (for example, operations to update the address of the next instruction to execute).

=== Controlling data transfers ===
Data transfer operations are used to control how operands and data are transported from memory to the interpreter and vice versa. These operations deal with the store and the retrieval order of operands from the store.

=== Memory management ===
Memory management is concerned with the operations performed in memory to allocate data and applications. In the abstract machine, data and programmes can be held indefinitely, or in the case of programming languages, memory can be allocated or deallocated using a more complex mechanism.

== Hierarchies ==
Abstract machine hierarchies are often employed, in which each machine uses the functionality of the level immediately below and adds additional functionality of its own to meet the level immediately above. A hardware computer, constructed with physical electronic devices, can be added at the most basic level. Above this level, the abstract microprogrammed machine level may be introduced. The abstract machine supplied by the operating system, which is implemented by a program written in machine language, is located immediately above (or directly above the hardware if the firmware level is not there). On the one hand, the operating system extends the capability of the physical machine by providing higher-level primitives that are not available on the physical machine (for example, primitives that act on files). The host machine is formed by the abstract machine given by the operating system, on which a high-level programming language is implemented using an intermediary machine, such as the Java Virtual machine and its byte code language. The level given by the abstract machine for the high-level language (for example, Java) is not usually the final level of hierarchy. At this point, one or more applications that deliver additional services together may be introduced. A &quot;web machine&quot; level, for example, can be added to implement the functionalities necessary to handle Web communications (communications protocols or HTML code presentation). The &quot;Web Service&quot; level is located above this, and it provides the functionalities necessary to make web services communicate, both in terms of interaction protocols and the behaviour of the processes involved. At this level, entirely new languages that specify the behaviour of so-called &quot;business processes&quot; based on Web services may be developed (an example is the Business Process Execution Language). Finally, a specialised application can be found at the highest level (for example, E-commerce) which has very specific and limited functionality.

<text>== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* After checking the ambitions of Nabis, the tyrant of Sparta, the Roman forces under proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus finally withdraw from Greece.
* With the Roman legions under Flaminius returning to Italy, the Greek states are once again on their own. The Romans leave the dominant powers in the region; the kingdom of Macedonia, the Aetolians, the strengthened Achaean League and the weakened Sparta. The Aetolians, who have opposed the Roman intervention in Greek affairs, incite the Spartan leader, Nabis, to retake his former territories and regain his influence in Greek affairs.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* With his peace agreement with the Egyptians in place, Antiochus III now turns his attention to the West. He is encouraged to challenge Rome&#x27;s protection of the Greeks by his advisor, the former Carthaginian general Hannibal.
* Philip V of Macedon, along with Rhodes, Pergamum, and the Achaean League, join Rome against Antiochus III.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Battle of Mutina is fought between the Romans and the Boii (a Gallic tribe). The Romans are victorious in the battle which effectively ends the threat of the Gauls in Italy.
* The Italian towns of Liternum and Puteoli become Roman colonies.

==== China ====
* The construction of the first city wall of Chang&#x27;an begins.
* Empress Lü protects the accession of her son Emperor Hui by executing Consort Qi and her son to Gaozu, Liu Ruyi.

==== Korea ====
* The Wiman Joseon kingdom of northern Korea (Choson) is founded by the Chinese Han dynasty general Wiman.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Births==

== Deaths ==
* Eratosthenes, Greek mathematician, geographer and astronomer (b. 276 BC)
* Concubine Qi, also known as Lady Qi or Consort Qi, favoured concubine of Han Gaozu (personal name Liu Bang), the first emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty

<text>Year 200 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Maximus and Cotta (or, less frequently, year 554 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 200 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Attalus I of Pergamum, who is with his fleet at Aegina, receives an embassy from Athens asking him to come to the city for consultations. After he is told that Roman ambassadors are also in Athens, Attalus goes there in haste.
* The Roman ambassador to Greece, Syria, and Egypt, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus delivers an ultimatum to Philip V warning Macedonia not to make war on any Greek state. Philip decides to reject the Roman ultimatum and the Romans declare war on Macedon, thus starting the Second Macedonian War.
* The Roman consul, Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus, asks Attalus I and his fleet to meet up with the Roman fleet off the Greek Aegean coast and they conduct a naval campaign against Philip V, harassing Macedonian possessions in and along the Aegean.

<text>Year 201 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lentulus and Paetus (or, less frequently, year 553 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 201 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Carthage ====
* On Hannibal&#x27;s advice, Carthage sues for peace with the Romans, ending the Second Punic War. Carthage is reduced to a client state of Rome. In the peace treaty between Carthage and Rome, Carthage surrenders all her Mediterranean possessions to Rome, including her Iberian territories. The Carthaginians agree to pay Rome 200 talents per year for 50 years, allow Masinissa to rule Numidia as an independent kingdom, make no war without Rome&#x27;s permission, and destroy all but 10 of the Carthaginian warships.
* Following the conclusion of the peace with Rome, Hannibal is elected as suffet, or chief magistrate, of Carthage. The office has over the years become insignificant in Carthaginian politics, but Hannibal restores its power and authority. He sets out to reform the administration and finances of Carthage and reduce the power of the oligarchy which has ruled Carthage before and during the Second Punic War.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Romans oust the Carthaginians from Malta.
* In Rome, according to the Roman historian Livy, land is distributed to veterans of the Second Punic War. This is the first documented instance of a practice that later becomes commonplace.

==== Greece ====
* Philip V of Macedon captures Samos and the Egyptian fleet stationed there. He then besieges Chios to the north.
* Rhodes and its allies Pergamum, Cyzicus, and Byzantium combine their fleets and defeat Philip V in the Battle of Chios. His flagship is trapped and rammed by two enemy ships.
* The Spartan king, Nabis, once more invades and captures Messene. However, the Spartans are forced to retreat when the Achaean League army of Philopoemen intervenes. Nabis&#x27; forces are decisively defeated at Tegea by Philopoemen and Nabis is forced to check his expansionist ambitions for the time being.

==== China ====
* The construction of city walls around Nanchang begins.
* King Xin of Han, in alliance with Modu Chanyu of the Xiongnu, launches a rebellion against the Han dynasty in the Taiyuan Commandery. He is defeated by Emperor Gaozu of Han and his generals, who chase Xin of Han into Xiongnu territory.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Gnaeus Naevius, Latin epic poet and dramatist of the Old Latin period, who invented a new genre of written historical plays called fabulae praetextae, which are based on Roman historical or legendary figures and events (b. c. 264 BC).
* Zhongli Mo, Chinese general during the Chu–Han Contention.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Carthage ====
* Having lost his alliance with the Numidian chief Masinissa, the Carthaginian general, Hasdrubal Gisco, finds a new ally in the Numidian king Syphax, who marries Sophonisba, Hasdrubal&#x27;s daughter, who, until his defection to Rome, has been betrothed to Masinissa.
* Roman forces under Publius Cornelius Scipio besiege Utica in Carthaginia. Scipio is unable to stop the combined forces of the Carthaginians under Hasdrubal Gisco and the Numidians under their chief, Syphax, and he is forced to lift his siege of Utica.

==== Egypt ====
* The late Egyptian King Ptolemy IV&#x27;s clique of favourites, led by Sosibius, Ptolemy&#x27;s chief minister, keeps Ptolemy&#x27;s death a secret, fearing retribution from the new king Ptolemy V&#x27;s mother, Queen Arsinoe III. They arrange for the murder of Arsinoe, and then the five-year-old king is officially elevated to the throne with Sosibius as his guardian. Arsinoe has been popular with the Egyptian population so rioting follows the news of her assassination.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Battle of Crotona is fought between Hannibal&#x27;s Carthaginian army, and a Roman force led by Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, with no decisive outcome for either side.
* End of the Second Punic War.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus III of the Syrian-based Seleucid kingdom realize Egypt&#x27;s weakness and agree to partition Egypt&#x27;s Anatolian and Aegean possessions. Antiochus&#x27; share is to be southern Syria, Lycia, Cilicia and Cyprus, while Philip is to gain western Anatolia and the Cyclades.

==== China ====
* Han Xin completes the conquest of Zhao and receives the surrender of Yan. He captures the Zhao capital of Handan and defeats Chu relief forces sent by Xiang Yu.
* Han Xin invades the State of Qi, defeats Qi&#x27;s armies, captures their capital Linzi and crushes a coalition army of Chu and Qi forces under Long Ju in the Battle of the Wei River. 
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<text>Year 203 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caepio and Geminus (or, less frequently, year 551 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 203 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Carthage ====
* The Roman general, Publius Cornelius Scipio, while undertaking peace negotiations with the Carthaginians at Utica, makes a surprise attack on the Carthaginian camp and destroys it. Then, sweeping down on the forces that the Carthaginians and their allies, the Numidians, are trying to muster on the Great Plains near the upper Bagradas River (in modern Tunisia), he smashes that army in the Battle of the Great Plains. The Numidian king, Syphax, and the Carthaginian leader, Hasdrubal Gisco, manage to escape separately.
* The Roman general, Gaius Laelius, and Rome&#x27;s Numidian ally, Masinissa, follow Syphax towards Cirta, the Numidian capital. In the pursuit, Syphax is captured after his badly wounded horse throws him off. He is delivered to Scipio and is made a prisoner of the Romans, dying in the Italian town of Alba Fucens later in the year.
* Masinissa becomes king of both the Massyli and the Massaesyli tribes in Numidia and remains a loyal ally to the Romans.
* Hasdrubal Gisco persuades the Carthaginians to raise a new army and to send for Hannibal to return home from Italy. Hannibal finally leaves Italy and returns to Carthage.
* The Carthaginian general, Mago Barca, is defeated and wounded by the Romans in the Battle of Insubria. He dies of his wounds on the return voyage to Carthage.
* A preliminary armistice between Carthage and Rome is declared and the Carthaginian armies accept Scipio&#x27;s severe terms. However, on his return to Carthage, Hannibal concentrates the remnants of the Carthaginian forces at Hadrumetum (modern Sousse, Tunisia) and prepares them for battle.

==== China ====
* Han Xin completes the conquest of Qi, and Liu Bang appoints him as its king.
* After Xiang Yu fails to persuade Han Xin to remain neutral, Han Xin and Liu Bang launch a five-pronged invasion of Chu. They decisively defeat Xiang Yu in the Battle of Chen and the Battle of Gaixia.
* Xiang Yu flees toward Wuyue and, pursued by Han cavalry, commits suicide.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Mago Barca, Carthaginian general during the Second Punic War against Rome who has accompanied his brother Hannibal on the invasion of Italy (b. 243 BC)
* Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, Roman general and statesman whose cautious delaying tactics (which have led to his surname Cunctator, meaning &quot;delayer&quot;) during the early stages of the Second Punic War have given Rome time to recover its strength and take the offensive against the invading Carthaginian army of Hannibal (b. c. 275 BC)
* Syphax, Numidian king allied with the Carthaginians during the Second Punic War against Rome

* The Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio secures Gades, thus making Roman control of Spain complete. With the effective withdrawal of the Carthaginians from Spain, Hispania becomes a Roman province.
* The city of Italica (northwest of modern Seville, Spain) is founded by Scipio as a place to settle for the Roman soldiers wounded in the Battle of Ilipa.

<text>Year 205 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Scipio and Dives (or, less frequently, year 549 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 205 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

==Events==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

===By place===

====Seleucid Empire====
* Returning via the Persian provinces of Arachosia, Drangiana, and Carmania, Antiochus III arrives in Persis. He then leads a short expedition down the Persian Gulf and receives tribute of 500 talents of silver from the citizens of Gerrha, a mercantile state on the west coast of the Persian Gulf.
* Antiochus III returns from his eastern campaigns, after having defeated the Bactrians and subjugated the Parthians and thus being able to partly restore Seleucid power in these provinces by crushing the revolting governors of Media, Persia and Anatolia. Having established a system of vassal states in the East, Antiochus now adopts the ancient Achaemenid title of &quot;great king&quot;, and the Greeks, comparing him to Alexander the Great, surname him &quot;the Great&quot;, that is to say Antiochus III Megas.

====Greece====
* Philip V of Macedon makes a temporary peace (the Peace of Phoenice) with Rome on favourable terms for Macedonia ending the First Macedonian War. The treaty formally acknowledges the favourable position of Macedonia, including their capture of Illyria, but in return Philip effectively repudiates his alliance with Hannibal.
* After the peace, the Spartan king, Nabis, goes to war with the Achaean League. The Achaean general Philopoemen expels Nabis of Sparta from Messene.
* The Peace of Phoenice prohibits Philip from expanding westward into Illyria or the Adriatic Sea, so the king turns his attentions eastwards to the Aegean Sea, where he starts to build a large fleet. After concluding the First Macedonian War, Philip of Macedon, seeing his chance to defeat Rhodes, forms an alliance with Aetolian and Spartan pirates who begin raiding Rhodian ships. The Cretan War begins between Philips&#x27; Macedonians, the Aetolian League, several Cretan cities (of which Olous and Hierapytna are the most important) and Spartan pirates against the forces of Rhodes and later Attalus I of Pergamum, Byzantium, Cyzicus, Athens and Knossos.
* With the Rhodian fleet and economy suffering from the depredations of the pirates, Philip begins attacking the lands of Rhodes&#x27; allies in Thrace and around the Sea of Marmara.

====Roman Republic====
* Publius Cornelius Scipio boldly determines to disregard Hannibal in Italy and political opposition in the Roman Senate and rather decides to strike at the Carthaginian holdings in North Africa. Scipio crosses to Sicily with an army consisting partly of volunteers as the Roman Senate would not provide him with an army.
* The Roman propraetor Quintus Pleminius captures the town of Locri Epizephyrii from the Carthaginians. Hannibal&#x27;s attempt to recapture the town is foiled by the appearance of Scipio&#x27;s army.
* Scipio sends the Roman general Gaius Laelius to North Africa to prepare the way for his later invasion.
* A Carthaginian army under Mago Barca lands in Liguria, capturing Genoa and Savona.
* Hannibal erects a bilingual Punic/Greek inscription describing his accomplishments in the temple of Juno Lacinia near Crotone.

====Egypt====
* The native Egyptian population rises in rebellion against their Greek rulers. The revolt spreads to Upper Egypt.
* Ptolemy IV dies and is succeeded by his five-year-old son Ptolemy V. However, no public announcement is made about the king&#x27;s death.

==== China ====
* Xiang Yu defeats Liu Bang in the Battle of Pengcheng.
* Han Xin captures Feiqiu, the last holdout of Zhang Han, thus completing the Han conquest of the Three Qins. Zhang Han commits suicide.
* Han Xin defeats Wei Bao and conquers the kingdom of Wei.
* Xiang Yu besieges Liu Bang&#x27;s forces in Xingyang and Chenggao.
* Han Xin begins the conquest of Dai and Zhao, and he defeats Chen Yu in the Battle of Jingxing.
* Ying Bu, the king of Jiujiang, allies with Liu Bang.

====Northern Asia====
* The Xiongnu leader, Modu Chanyu, conquers the neighbouring nomadic Yuezhi and Donghu peoples, thereby establishing the Xiongnu Empire. He appoints a Tuqi King of the left (east) and a Tuqi King of the right (west) to prevent rebellions. 
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
*Ptolemy IV Philopator, Greek king of Egypt who has reigned from 221 BC (b. c. 238 BC)
* Sima Ang, Chinese ruler of the Eighteen Kingdoms
*Zhang Han, Chinese general of the Qin dynasty

<text>Year 207 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Nero and Salinator (or, less frequently, year 547 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 207 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Roman consul Gaius Claudius Nero fights an indecisive battle with the Carthaginian general Hannibal at Grumentum. Nero is unable to stop Hannibal&#x27;s advance into Canusium. Nevertheless, he rapidly marches the elite parts of his army some one hundred kilometres north to reinforce the army of Marcus Livius Salinator.
* The Battle of the Metaurus, fought near the Metaurus River in Umbria, is a pivotal battle during the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage. The Carthaginians are led by Hannibal&#x27;s brother Hasdrubal Barca, and the Roman armies are led by the consuls Marcus Livius Salinator and Gaius Claudius Nero. The Carthaginian army is defeated by the Romans and Hasdrubal is killed in the battle. This major loss by the Carthaginians ends Hannibal&#x27;s hopes of success in Italy.

==== Greece ====
* The general leading the Achaean League, Philopoemen, introduces heavier Macedonian armour and phalanx tactics. His army then crushes the Spartans under the Spartan regent and general, Machanidas, in the battle of Mantinea. Machanidas is killed by Philopoemen during the battle.
* Nabis, a Syrian sold into slavery, rises to power in Sparta and becomes regent of the young Spartan king, Pelops, following the death of Machanidas. Nabis soon overthrows Pelops, claiming to be a descendant of the Eurypontid Spartan king Demaratus. Nabis then starts a social revolution which will lead to the freeing of all the helots, the destruction of the ruling oligarchy, the redistribution of land and the cancelling of debts.

==== Vietnam ====
* When king An Dương Vương dies, so does his dynasty and the Triệu dynasty and the kingdom of Nam Việt are established.

==== China ====
* The Chu rebel Xiang Yu defeats the Qin general Zhang Han in the Battle of Julu and becomes the leader of the rebellion against the Qin dynasty.
* Xiang Yu defeats Zhang Han in the Battle of the Yushui River. Zhang Han then surrenders to Xiang Yu.
* Emperor Qin Er Shi of the Qin dynasty is assassinated by Prime Minister Zhao Gao. He is replaced by his nephew Ziying, who in turn assassinates Zhao Gao. Ziying takes power as the king of Qin rather than as emperor.
* The Chu rebel Liu Bang invades Guanzhong. After another military defeat, Ziying surrenders to Liu, who then occupies the Qin capital Xianyang. This marks the end of the Qin dynasty.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<text>Year 209 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Verrucosus and Flaccus (or, less frequently, year 545 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 209 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Roman Republic ====
* The Romans under Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus capture Tarentum (modern Taranto), which the Carthaginian general Hannibal has held for three years.
* The Battle of Canusium is fought between Hannibal&#x27;s Carthaginian army and a Roman force led by Marcus Claudius Marcellus. The battle is indecisive.
* From his headquarters at Tarraco (Tarragona), Publius Cornelius Scipio, the Roman commander in Spain, launches a combined military and naval assault on the Carthaginian headquarters at Carthago Nova (modern-day Cartagena). He successfully besieges and captures the city. In capturing this city, Scipio gains access to copious stores and supplies, Spanish hostages, the local silver mines, a splendid harbour and a base for an advance further south.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The King of the Parthians, Arsaces II, is attacked by the Seleucid king Antiochus III, who takes Hecatompylos (southeast of the Caspian Sea), the Arsacid capital and Syrinx in Hyrcania. Antiochus III defeats Arsaces II at the Battle of Mount Labus and then forces Arsaces II to enter into an alliance with the Seleucids.

==== Greece ====
* As strategos of the Achaeans, the Greek general Philopoemen is responsible for turning the Achaean League into an aggressive military power. He builds up the League&#x27;s military capability. The Achaean League&#x27;s army and cavalry under Philopoemen then defeat the Aetolians on the Elean frontier.

==== China ====

He declares himself King Wu of Nanyue.

==== Central Asia ====
* Modun khaan inherits Teoman&#x27;s Hunnu confederations and founds the Xiongnu Empire in Mongolia proper. Modu&#x27;s forces push into Northern China, threatening the Qin Empire and forcing them to further fortify the Great Wall.

<text>Pinball games are a family of games in which a ball is propelled into a specially designed table where it bounces off various obstacles, scoring points either en route or when it comes to rest. Historically the board was studded with nails called &#x27;pins&#x27; and had hollows or pockets which scored points if the ball came to rest in them. Today, pinball is most commonly an arcade game in which the ball is fired into a specially designed cabinet known as a pinball machine, hitting various lights, bumpers, ramps, and other targets depending on its design.

The game&#x27;s object is generally to score as many points as possible by hitting these targets and making various shots with flippers before the ball is lost. Most pinball machines use one ball per turn, except during special multi-ball phases, and the game ends when the ball(s) from the last turn are lost. The biggest pinball machine manufacturers historically include Bally Manufacturing, Gottlieb, Williams Electronics and Stern Pinball.

Currently active pinball machine manufacturers include Stern Pinball, Jersey Jack Pinball, American Pinball, Chicago Gaming Company, Pinball Brothers, Dutch Pinball, Spooky Pinball and Multimorphic, Inc., as well as several smaller boutique manufacturers.

==History==
The history of pinball machines varies by the source. These machines definitely arrived in recognizable form prior to World War II. The opinions on the relevance of the earlier prototypes varies depending on the definition of the pinball machine, for example:
* some researchers, like Steven L. Kent, declare that the history begins in the 1930s when Gottlieb&#x27;s Baffle Ball and Raymond Maloney&#x27;s Ballyhoo were manufactured in large quantities;
* Roger Sharpe, a pinball historian, asserts that the origin lies in Montague Redgrave&#x27;s patents for the spring plunger and playfield bells (1871);
* Richard M. Bueschel traces the history way back to the 1500s when the table versions of garden bowling games were invented.

===Pre-modern: Development of outdoor and tabletop ball games===

The origins of pinball are intertwined with the history of many other games. Games played outdoors by rolling balls or stones on a grass course, such as bocce or bowls, eventually evolved into various local ground billiards games played by hitting the balls with sticks and propelling them at targets, often around obstacles. Croquet, golf and pall-mall eventually derived from ground billiards variants.

The evolution of outdoor games finally led to indoor versions that could be played on a table, such as billiards, or on the floor of a pub, like bowling and shuffleboard. The tabletop versions of these games became the ancestors of modern pinball.

===Late 18th century: Spring launcher invented===

In France, during the long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or skittles at one end of the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the table&#x27;s bed became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the more challenging scorable holes. A standardized version of the game eventually became known as bagatelle.

Somewhere between the 1750s and 1770s, the bagatelle variant &quot;, or Japanese billiards in English, was invented in Western Europe, despite its name. Also called &quot;Stosspudel&quot;, it used thin metal pins and replaced the cue at the player&#x27;s end of the table with a coiled spring and a plunger. The player shot balls up the inclined playfield toward the scoring targets using this plunger, a device that remains in use in pinball to this day, and the game was also directly ancestral to pachinko.

===1869: Spring launchers become mainstream===

In 1869, British inventor Montague Redgrave settled in the United States and manufactured bagatelle tables in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1871 Redgrave was granted U.S. Patent #115,357 for his &quot;Improvements in Bagatelle&quot;, another name for the spring launcher that was first introduced in &quot;&quot;. The game also shrank in size to fit atop a bar or counter. The balls became marbles and the wickets became small metal pins. Redgrave&#x27;s popularization of the spring launcher and innovations in game design (playfield bells) are acknowledged as the birth of pinball in its modern form.

===1931: Coin operation introduced===
By the 1930s, manufacturers were producing coin-operated versions of bagatelles, now known as &quot;marble games&quot; or &quot;pin games&quot;. The table was under glass and used Montague Redgrave&#x27;s plunger device to propel the ball into the upper playfield. In 1931 David Gottlieb&#x27;s &quot;Baffle Ball&quot; became the first hit of the coin-operated era. Selling for $17.50, the game dispensed five to seven balls for a penny. At its peak, Gottlieb produced 400 &quot;Baffle Ball&quot; machines per day and establishing the company as the first major manufacturer of pinball machines.

In 1932, Gottlieb distributor Raymond Moloney found it hard to obtain more Baffle Ball units to sell. In his frustration he founded Lion Manufacturing to produce a game of his design, &quot;Ballyhoo&quot;, named after a popular magazine. The game became a smash hit. Its larger playfield and ten pockets made it more challenging than &quot;Baffle Ball&quot;, selling 50,000 units in 7 months. Moloney eventually changed the name of his company to Bally to reflect the success of this game. These early machines were relatively small, mechanically simple and designed to sit on a counter or bar top.

===1933: Electrification and active bumpers introduced===

The 1930s saw major advances in pinball design with the introduction of electrification. Pacific Amusements in Los Angeles, California produced &quot;Contact&quot; in 1933, which had an electrically powered solenoid to propel the ball out of a bonus hole in the middle of the playfield. Another solenoid rang a bell to reward the player. &quot;Contact&quot;&#x27;s designer, Harry Williams, eventually formed his own company, Williams Manufacturing, in 1944. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit with similar features. Electric lights soon became standard on all pinball games, to attract players.

By the end of 1932, approximately 150 companies manufactured pinball machines, most of them in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago has been the center of pinball manufacturing ever since. Competition was strong, and by 1934, only 14 companies remained.

During World War II, all major manufacturers of coin-operated games turned to manufacturing for the war effort. Some, like Williams, bought old games from operators and refurbished them, adding new artwork with a patriotic theme. At the end of the war, a generation of Americans looked for amusement in bars and malt shops, and pinball saw another golden age. Improvements such as the tilt-sensing mechanism and the awarding of free games (replays) appeared.

===1947: Flippers introduced===

Gottlieb&#x27;s &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;, introduced in 1947, was the first game to add player-controlled flippers to keep the ball in play longer. The low-power flippers required three pairs around the playfield to get the ball to the top.

&quot;Triple Action&quot; was the first game to feature just two flippers at the bottom of the playfield. Unlike in modern machines, the flippers faced outwards. These flippers were made more powerful by the addition of a DC (direct current) power supply. These innovations were some of many by designer Steve Kordek.

The first game to feature the familiar dual-inward-facing-flipper design was Gottlieb&#x27;s &quot;Just 21&quot; released in January 1950. However, the flippers were rather far apart to allow for a turret ball shooter at the bottom center of the playfield. Another 1950 Gottlieb game, &quot;Spot Bowler&quot;, was the first with inward-facing flippers placed close together.

The post-war era was dominated by Gottlieb. Game designers Wayne Neyens and Ed Krynski, with artist Leroy Parker, produced games that collectors consider some of the best classic pinball machines.

===1970s: Solid-state electronics and digital displays introduced===

The introduction of microprocessors brought pinball into the realm of electronic gaming. The electromechanical relays and scoring reels that drove games in the 1950s and 1960s were replaced in the 1970s with circuit boards and digital displays. The first pinball machine using a microprocessor was Flicker, a prototype made by Bally in 1974. Bally soon followed that up with a solid-state version of Bow and Arrow in the same year with a microprocessor board that would be used in eight other machines until 1978, which included Eight Ball, the machine that held the sales record from 1977 to 1993.

The first solid-state pinball is believed by some to be Mirco Games&#x27; &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; (1976), though the first mainstream solid-state game was Williams&#x27; &quot;Hot Tip&quot; (1977). This new technology led to a boom for Williams and Bally, who attracted more players with games featuring more complex rules, digital sound effects, and speech.

The video game boom of the 1980s signaled the end of the boom for pinball. Arcades replaced rows of pinball machines with video games like 1978&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot;, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and 1981&#x27;s &quot;Galaga&quot;. These earned significantly greater profits than the pinball machines of the day while simultaneously requiring less maintenance. Bally, Williams, and Gottlieb continued to make pinball machines while also manufacturing video games in much higher numbers.

Many of the larger companies were acquired by, or merged with, other companies. Chicago Coin was purchased by the Stern family, who brought the company into the digital era as Stern Enterprises, which closed its doors in the mid-1980s. Bally exited the pinball business in 1988 and sold their assets to Williams, who subsequently used the Bally trademark from then on for about half of their pinball releases.

While the video game craze of the late 1970s and early 1980s dealt a severe blow to pinball revenue, it sparked the industry&#x27;s creative talents. All companies involved tried to take advantage of the new solid-state technology to improve player appeal of pinball and win back former players from video games. Some of this creativity resulted in landmark designs and features still present today. Some of these include speech, such as Williams&#x27; &quot;Gorgar&quot;; ramps for the ball to travel around, such as Williams&#x27; &quot;Space Shuttle&quot;; &quot;multiball&quot;, used on Williams&#x27; &quot;Firepower&quot;; multi-level games like Gottlieb&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole&quot; and Williams&#x27; &quot;Black Knight&quot;; and blinking chase lights, as used on Bally&#x27;s &quot;Xenon&quot;. Although these novel features did not win back players as the manufacturers had hoped, they changed players&#x27; perception of pinball for decades.

===1980s and 1990s: Pinball in the digital age===

During the 1980s, pinball manufacturers navigated technology changes while going through changes of ownership and mergers: Gottlieb was sold to Premier Technologies, and Bally merged with Williams. The video game crash of 1983 made the manufacturers refocus on their pinball sales. A trend started of pinball becoming increasingly elaborate to use more computing resources, following video games.

Games in the latter half of the 1980s such as High Speed started incorporating full soundtracks, elaborate light shows and backbox animations - a radical change from the previous decade&#x27;s electromechanical games. Although pinball continued to compete with video games in arcades, pinball held a premium niche, since the video games of the time could not reproduce an accurate pinball experience.

By the first years of the 1990s, pinball had made a strong comeback and saw new sales highs. Some new manufacturers entered the field, such as Capcom Pinball and Alvin G. and Company, founded by Alvin Gottlieb, son of David Gottlieb. Gary Stern, the son of Williams co-founder Sam Stern, founded Data East Pinball with funding from Data East Japan.

The games from Williams now dominated the industry, with complicated mechanical devices and more elaborate display and sound systems attracting new players to the game. Licensing popular movies and icons of the day became a staple for pinball, with Bally/Williams&#x27; &quot;The Addams Family&quot; from 1992 hitting a modern sales record of 20,270 machines. In 1994, Williams commemorated this benchmark with a limited edition of 1,000 &quot;Addams Family Gold&quot; pinball machines, featuring gold-colored trim and updated software with new game features. Other notable popular licenses included &quot;Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Expanding markets in Europe and Asia helped fuel the revival of interest. Pat Lawlor was a designer, working for Williams until their exit from the industry in 1999. About a year later, Lawlor returned to the industry, starting his own company, working in conjunction with Stern Pinball to produce new games.

The end of the 1990s saw another downturn in the industry, with Gottlieb, Capcom, and Alvin G. closing by the end of 1996. Data East&#x27;s pinball division was acquired by Sega and became Sega Pinball in 1994. By 1997, there were two companies left: Sega Pinball and Williams. In 1999, Sega sold their pinball division to Gary Stern, President of Sega Pinball at the time, who called his company Stern Pinball.

By this time, Williams games rarely sold more than 4,000 units. In 1999, Williams attempted to revive sales with the Pinball 2000 line of games, merging a video display into the pinball playfield. The reception was initially good with &quot;Revenge from Mars&quot; selling well over 6,000 machines, but short of the 10,000-plus production runs for releases just six years earlier. The next Pinball 2000 game, &quot;Star Wars Episode I&quot;, sold only a little over 3,500 machines.

Williams exited the pinball business on October 25, 1999 to focus on making gaming equipment for casinos, which was more profitable. They licensed the rights to reproduce Bally/Williams parts to Illinois Pinball and reproduce full-sized machines to The Pinball Factory. Stern Pinball remained the only manufacturer of original pinball machines until 2013, when Jersey Jack Pinball started shipping &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Most members of the design teams for Stern Pinball are former employees of Williams.

Amid the 1990s closures, virtual pinball simulations, marketed on computers and home consoles, had become high enough in quality for serious players to take notice: these video versions of pinball such as Epic Pinball, Full Tilt! Pinball and the Pro Pinball series found marketplace success and lasting fan interest, starting a new trend for realistic pinball simulation. This market existed largely independently from the physical pinball manufacturers, and relied upon original designs instead of licenses until the 2000s.

===2000s and beyond: Revival===
After most pinball manufacturers&#x27; closure in the 1990s, smaller independent manufacturers started appearing in the early 2000s.

In November 2005, The Pinball Factory (TPF) in Melbourne, Australia, announced that they would be producing a new &quot;Crocodile Hunter&quot;-themed pinball machine under the Bally label. With the death of Steve Irwin, it was announced that the future of this game was uncertain. In 2006, TPF announced that they would be reproducing two popular 1990s era Williams machines, &quot;Medieval Madness&quot; and &quot;Cactus Canyon&quot;. TPF, however, was unable to make good on its promises to produce new machines, and in October 2010 transferred its Williams Electronics Games licenses as well as its pinball spare parts manufacturing and distribution business to Planetary Pinball Supply Inc, a California distributor of pinball replacement parts.

In 2006, Illinois pinball company PinBall Manufacturing Inc. produced 178 reproductions of Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Big Bang Bar&quot; for the European and US markets. In 2010, MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of Inder&#x27;s original &quot;Canasta&quot; titled &quot;New Canasta&quot;, which was the first game to include a liquid-crystal display (LCD) screen in the backbox.

In 2013, Jersey Jack Pinball released &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; pinball machine, based on the 1939 film. It is the first pinball machine manufactured in the US with a large color display (LCD) in the backbox, the first widebody pinball machine since 1994 and the first new US pinball machine not made by Stern Pinball since 2001. This game was followed several additional pinball machines, incorporating both existing media properties and original themes.

In 2013, the Chicago Gaming Company announced the creation of a remake of &quot;Medieval Madness&quot;. This was later followed by three additional remakes of earlier machines. They would announce their first original title, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, based on the film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, in 2023.

In 2014, the new pinball manufacturer Spooky Pinball released their first game &quot;America&#x27;s Most Haunted&quot;. This was followed by a few more themed, original, and contracted titles.

In 2015, the new British pinball manufacturer Heighway Pinball released the racing themed pinball machine &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. The game has an LCD screen for scores, info, and animations located in the playfield surface at player&#x27;s eye view. The game was designed with modularity in mind so that the playfield and artwork could be swapped out for future game titles. Heighway Pinball&#x27;s second title, &quot;Alien&quot;, was released in 2017 and was based on the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; films. Due to internal company issues, Heighway Pinball ceased manufacturing operations and closed its doors in April 2018.

In 2016, Dutch Pinball, based in the Netherlands, released their first game &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, based on the 1998 film, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. In 2017, Multimorphic began shipping its pinball machine platform after several years of development. It is a modular design where different games can be swapped into the cabinet. It also has a large interactive display as the playfield surface, which differs from all prior pinball machines traditionally made of plywood and embedded with translucent plastic inserts for lighting.

In 2017, American Pinball released its first production game, Houdini, followed by Oktoberfest (2018), Hot Wheels (2020), Legends of Valhalla (2020), and Galactic Tank Force (2023). In 2022 Flutter released an online pinball game. That same year Google released an Easter Egg pinball game on IOS.

In 2023, Barrels of Fun released its first production game, Jim Henson&#x27;s Labyrinth.

===Relation to gambling===

Pinball machines, like many other mechanical games, were sometimes used as gambling devices. Some pinball machines, such as Bally&#x27;s &quot;bingos&quot;, featured a grid on the backglass scoring area with spaces corresponding to targets or holes on the playfield. Free games could be won if the player could get the balls to land in a winning pattern; however, doing this was nearly random, and a common use for such machines was for gambling. Other machines allowed players to win and accumulate large numbers of &quot;free games&quot; which could then be cashed out for money with the location owner.

Later, this type of feature was discontinued to legitimize the machines, and to avoid legal problems in areas where awarding free games was considered illegal, some games, called Add-A-Ball, did away with the free game feature, instead giving players extra balls to play, between 5 and 25 in most cases. These extra balls were indicated via lighted graphics in the backglass or by a ball count wheel, but in some areas that was disallowed, and some games were shipped with a sticker to cover the counters.

Pinball was banned beginning in the early 1940s until 1976 in New York City. New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia was responsible for the ban, believing that it robbed school children of their hard-earned nickels and dimes. La Guardia spearheaded major raids throughout the city, collecting thousands of machines. The mayor participated with police in destroying machines with sledgehammers before dumping the remnants into the city&#x27;s rivers.

The ban ended when Roger Sharpe, a star witness for the AMOA – Amusement and Music Operators Association, testified in April 1976 before a committee in a Manhattan courtroom that pinball games had become games of skill and were not games of chance, which are more closely associated with gambling. He began to play one of two games set up in the courtroom, and – in a move he compares to Babe Ruth&#x27;s home run in the 1932 World Series – called out precisely what he was going to shoot for, and then proceeded to do so. Astonished committee members reportedly voted to remove the ban, which was followed in other cities. Sharpe reportedly acknowledges, in a self-deprecating manner, his courtroom shot was by sheer luck although there was admittedly skill involved in what he did.

Like New York, Los Angeles banned pinball machines in 1939. The ban was overturned by the Supreme Court of California in 1974 because (1) if pinball machines were games of chance, the ordinance was preempted by state law governing games of chance in general, and (2) if they were games of skill, the ordinance was unconstitutional as a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Although it was rarely enforced, Chicago&#x27;s ban on pinball lasted three decades and ended in 1976. Philadelphia and Salt Lake City also had similar bans. Regardless of these events, some towns in America still have such bans on their books; the town of Kokomo, Indiana lifted its ordinance banning pinball in December 2016,and although the law is no longer enforced, South Carolina still bans minors under 18 from playing pinball machines (SC-63-19-2430).

== Components ==

=== Cabinet ===

The cabinet of a pinball machine is the (traditionally wooden) frame usually shaped like a box, with the playfield laid inside.

===Backbox/head===
The &#x27;backbox&#x27;, &#x27;head&#x27;, or &#x27;lightbox&#x27; is the vertical box atop the cabinet opposite the player&#x27;s position. It usually consists of a wooden box with colorful graphics on the side and a large &#x27;backglass&#x27; in the front. The backglass usually has very stylized graphics related to the game.

=== Playfield ===
The &quot;playfield&quot; is a planar surface inclined upward, usually at six and a half degrees, away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play.

The ball is put into play by use of the &quot;plunger&quot;, a spring-loaded rod that strikes the ball as it rests in an entry lane, or as in some newer games, by a button that signals the game logic to fire a solenoid that strikes the ball. With both devices the result is the same: The ball is propelled upwards onto the playfield. Once a ball is in play, it tends to move downward towards the player, although the ball can move in any direction, sometimes unpredictably, due to contact with objects on the playfield or by the player&#x27;s actions. To return the ball to the upper part of the playfield, the player uses one or more &quot;flippers&quot;.

Manipulation of the ball may also be accomplished by various tricks, such as &quot;nudging&quot;. However, excessive nudging is generally penalized by losing the current player&#x27;s turn (known as &quot;tilting&quot;) or ending of the entire game when the nudging is particularly violent (known as &quot;slam tilting&quot;). This penalty was instituted because nudging the machine too much may damage it or result in unearned play and scoring that wears game parts. Many games also have a slam tilt in the bottom of the cabinet to end the game if the cabinet is raised and dropped to the floor in an attempt to trigger the coin counting switch falsely.

=== Plunger ===

The &quot;plunger&quot; is a spring-loaded rod with a small handle, used to propel the ball into the playfield. The player can control the amount of force used for launching by pulling the plunger a certain distance (thus changing the spring compression). This is often used for a &quot;skill shot&quot;, in which a player attempts to launch a ball so that it exactly hits a specified target. Once the ball is in motion in the main area of the playfield, the plunger is not used again until another ball must be brought onto the playfield. An electronically controlled launcher is sometimes substituted for the plunger in modern machines.
The shape of the ball launch button that replaces the plunger may be modified to fit the aesthetics of a particular game&#x27;s theme, such as being made to look like the trigger of a gun in a game with a military or action-hero theme.

=== Flippers ===
The &quot;flippers&quot; are one or more mechanically or electromechanically (solenoid) controlled levers, roughly in length, used for redirecting the ball up the playfield. They are the main control that the player has over the ball, usually by corresponding pushbuttons on the cabinet&#x27;s sides. They can primarily be switched fully on, sometimes with two different strengths for thrusting the flipper up and for holding it in position. Careful timing of this limited positional control allows the player to direct the ball in a range of directions with various levels of velocity and spin. With the flippers, the player attempts to move the ball to hit various types of scoring targets, and to keep the ball from disappearing off the bottom of the playfield.

The very first pinball games appeared in the early 1930s and did not have flippers. After launching the ball simply proceeded down the playfield, directed by static nails (or &quot;pins&quot;) to one of several scoring areas. These pins gave the game its name. In 1947, the first mechanical flippers appeared on Gottlieb&#x27;s &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; and by the early 1950s, the two-flipper configuration at the bottom above the center drain had become standard.

Some pinball models have a third or fourth flipper. A few later machines have flippers that the machine&#x27;s software could operate independently of the flipper button. During &quot;Thing Flips&quot; on &quot;The Addams Family&quot; pinball machine, the upper-left flipper automatically triggers a brief moment after the ball passes an optical sensor just above the flipper. Very few machines came with curve-shaped banana flippers.

The introduction of flippers ushered in the &quot;golden age&quot; of pinball, where the fierce competition between the various pinball manufacturers led to constant innovation in the field. Various types of stationary and moving targets were added, spinning scoring reels replaced games featuring static scores lit from behind. Multiplayer scores were added soon after, and then bells and other noise-makers, all of which began to make pinball less a game and more of an experience. The flippers have loaned pinball its common name in many languages, where the game is known mainly as &quot;flipper&quot;.

=== Bumpers ===

&quot;Bumpers&quot; are round knobs that, when hit, will actively push the ball away. There is also an earlier variety of bumper (known as a &quot;dead bumper&quot; or &quot;passive bumper&quot;) that does not propel the ball away; most bumpers on machines built since the 1960s are active bumpers, variously called &quot;pop bumpers&quot;, &quot;thumper bumpers&quot;, &quot;jet bumpers&quot;, or &quot;turbo bumpers&quot;. Most recent games include a set of pop bumpers, usually three, sometimes more or fewer depending on the designer&#x27;s goals. Bumpers predate flippers, and active bumpers served to add interest and complexity to older games.

Pop bumpers are operated by a switch connected to a ring surrounding the bottom circumference of the bumper that is suspended several millimeters above the playfield surface. When the ball rolls over this ring and forces one side of it down, a switch is closed that activates the bumper&#x27;s solenoid. This pulls down a tapered ring surrounding the central post of the bumper that pushes downward and outward on the ball, propelling it away.

=== Kickers and slingshots ===
&quot;Kickers&quot; and &quot;slingshots&quot; are rubber pads that propel the ball away upon impact, like bumpers, but are usually a horizontal side of a wall. Every recent pinball machine includes slingshots to the upper left and upper right of the lowest set of flippers; older games used more experimental arrangements. They operate similarly to pop bumpers, with a switch on each side of a solenoid-operated lever arm in a typical arrangement. The switches are closed by ball contact with the rubber on the kicker&#x27;s face, which activates the solenoid.

Early pinball machines typically had full solenoid current passing through trigger switches for all types of solenoids, from kickers to pop bumpers to the flippers themselves. This caused arcing across switch contacts and rapid contact fouling and failure. As electronics were gradually implemented in pinball design, solenoids began to be switched by power transistors under software control to lower switch voltage and current, vastly extend switch service lifetime, and add flexibility to game design.

The smaller, lower-powered solenoids were first to be transistorized, followed later by the higher-current solenoids as the price, performance, and reliability of power transistors improved over the years.

=== Targets ===
* &quot;Stationary Targets&quot;: These are static targets that simply record when a ball strikes them. These are generally the simplest playfield elements. They are also known as &quot;spot targets&quot; or &quot;standup targets&quot;.
* &quot;Bullseye Targets&quot;: These are static targets that have two concentric elements, similar to a stationary target. Hitting the outer ring usually scores lower than hitting the center bull&#x27;s eye. They are found chiefly in older electro-mechanical games.
* &quot;Drop targets&quot;: These are targets that drop below the playfield when hit. Eliminating an entire row in this manner may lead to any of various features. Once an entire bank of drop targets is hit, the bank may reset or pop back up. Alternatively, the drop targets can be placed in front of other targets, requiring the drop target to be knocked down before the targets behind can be hit, or the drop target may only pop up at specific times to deny the player the ability to shoot the ball into whatever is behind it. If used in the latter way, the target is usually blocking a lane or ramp.
* &quot;Kicking Target&quot;: Used rarely, these targets look like stationary targets, but when hit, they kick the ball away in the opposite direction, much like a slingshot or bumper.
* &quot;Vari-Target&quot;: These targets award different points depending on how hard the target was hit. It is a metal arm that pivots under the playfield. When a ball hits it, it ratchets back sometimes, resetting immediately or resetting only after it is hit all the way back. A large sum of points is usually awarded when the target is hit back all the way with one strike of the ball.

=== Holes and saucers ===

* &quot;Holes&quot;: The player directs the ball into a hole. In modern games, there are both vertical and horizontal holes (also called &quot;scoops&quot;), and the game may include mechanisms to move the ball between them. A &quot;gobble hole&quot; is sometimes included in some older games, which does not return the ball, but gives a large bonus or a game feature, which may be the ball itself.
* &quot;Saucers&quot;: A shallow hole with a kicker inside. The ball remains visible on the playfield and is kicked out straight up (usually into a duct or rail chute) or sideways back onto the playfield.

Initially, holes and saucers worked by using tubes behind the playing field, with a pin at the top to hold the ball for later drops. Another version of the tube uses two spinning wheels to transfer the ball from hole to hole. Newer versions use an electronic track with a carriage or an electromagnet to pull the ball between holes.

=== Spinners and rollovers ===
* &quot;Spinners&quot;: A ball can push through a flat surface hinged in the middle, causing it to spin; each rotation adds points.
* &quot;Rollovers&quot;: These are targets activated when a ball rolls over them. Often a series of rollover targets are placed side-by-side and with dividers between them forming &quot;lanes&quot;; the player must guide the ball to particular lanes (or to all lanes) to complete an objective. Such lanes are frequently placed at the bottom sides of the playfield: &quot;inlanes&quot; feed the ball back to the flippers, &quot;outlanes&quot; cause the ball to drain immediately. On many machines, outlanes can have extra balls or &quot;specials&quot; lit to play the same role as the older gobble holes.
* &quot;Whirlwind Spinner(s)&quot;: Used in some games, a whirlwind spinner is a rapidly rotating (often rubberized) disk on the playfield that momentarily &quot;grabs&quot; the ball and throws it in a random direction. Some games couple a whirlwind spinner with a magnet placed in the center, although Data East seems to be the only manufacturer to do so. Bally&#x27;s &quot;Fireball&quot; and Chicago Coin&#x27;s &quot;Casino&quot; were popular games with a whirlwind spinner.

=== Switches, gates, and stoppers ===

* &quot;Switch&quot;: A switch is an area that is blocked off after the ball passes through it once. An example of this is the initial firing lane: as a ball passes through the firing lane, it hits a switch and cannot reenter that chute.
* &quot;Gate&quot;: This block will allow balls to come through one way but will block the ball if it is going the other way.
* &quot;Stopper&quot;: Also called a &quot;magic post&quot;, this is a small pole most often found centered between and just below the lowest set of flippers and also rarely next to the outlanes. When activated (typically by hitting a specific target or targets), the pole ascends from inside the machine, blocking the area between the flippers for a limited time, making it more difficult to drain and lose the ball. After time expires, it returns to its resting place just below the playfield.

=== Ramps ===
Ramps are inclined planes with a gentle enough slope that the ball may travel along it. The player attempts to direct the ball with enough force to make it to the top of the ramp and down the other side. If the player succeeds, a &quot;ramp shot&quot; has been made. Ramps frequently end so that the ball goes to a flipper so one can make several ramp shots in a row. The number of ramp shots scored in a game is often tallied, and reaching certain numbers may lead to various game features. At other times, the ramps will go to smaller &quot;mini-playfields&quot; (small playfields, usually raised above the main game surface, with special goals or scoring).

=== Toys, magnets and captive balls ===

* &quot;Toys&quot;: Toys are various items on, above, or beneath the playfield (items beneath the playfield visible through windows) or attached to the cabinet (usually to the backbox). Usually, each toy is unique to the machine it was made for, and reflects the game&#x27;s theme. They may be visual only, and have no effect on gameplay; they may be alternate ways of performing common game functions (for example, instead of using a drop hole to hold the ball, a hand or claw might reach out, grab the ball, and capture it that way); or they may be an integral part of the game rules and play (for instance, having a smaller playfield over the main playfield that can be tilted right and left by the player, using the flipper buttons).
* &quot;Electromagnets&quot;: Some machines feature electrically operated magnets below the playfield to affect the ball&#x27;s speed and trajectory according to the current state of gameplay. This may be done to make the ball&#x27;s movement unpredictable, temporarily halt the ball (as a ball saver, for example), or otherwise control the ball by non-mechanical means. Electromagnets may also be used in above-playfield elements (often as part of the playfield toys) to grab the ball and move it elsewhere (onto a mini-playfield, for example). The Williams machine &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; featured a mini-playfield that used electromagnets controlled by the flipper buttons, allowing the player to flip the ball on the mini-playfield, essentially working as invisible flippers. Contrary to a popular myth, there are no professionally produced pinball machines that contain magnets under the playfield intended to clandestinely make gameplay harder or increase ball losses.
* &quot;Captive balls&quot;: Sometimes a ball can move around only within a confined area. A typical application of this has a short lane on the playfield with a narrow opening, inside which a captive ball is held. The player can strike this captive ball with the ball in play, pushing it along the lane to activate a rollover switch or target. In games such as &quot;Theatre of Magic&quot;, captive balls sometimes have what is called a &quot;Newton Ball&quot;, which is a stationary ball adjacent to a free ball in a small lane. The ball being played strikes the Newton ball which, in turn, transfers its momentum to the adjacent ball, which causes it to move.

=== Backglass ===

The &quot;backglass&quot; is a vertical graphic panel mounted on the front of the backbox. The backglass contains the name of the machine, graphics, and score displays (lights, mechanical wheels, an LED display, or a dot-matrix display depending on the era). Some backglasses include a mechanical device tied to gameplay, such as &quot;NBA Fastbreak&quot;, which featured a miniature basketball and hoop. For older games, the backglass image is screen printed in layers on the reverse side of a piece of glass; in more recent games, the image is imprinted into a translite.

== Features ==

There are other idiosyncratic features on many pinball playfields. Pinball games have become increasingly complex and multiple play modes, multi-level playfields, and even progression through a rudimentary &quot;plot&quot; have become common features in recent games. Pinball scoring objectives can be quite complex and require a series of targets to be hit in a particular order. Recent pinball games are distinguished by increasingly complex rule sets that require a measure of strategy and planning by the player for maximum scoring. Players seeking the highest scores would be well-advised to study the placard (usually found in the lower-left corner of the playfield) to learn each game&#x27;s specific patterns required for these advanced features and scoring.

Common features in modern pinball games include the following:

* &quot;Ball lock&quot;: Each time a ball goes into a specific hole or target, it is locked, and a new ball appears at the plunger. The multiball feature starts when the player has locked the required number of balls (often three). On some games, the balls are physically locked in place by solenoid-actuated gates, but many newer machines use virtual ball locks instead, in which the game merely keeps count of the number of locked balls and then auto-launches them from the main ball trough when it is time for them to be released.
* &quot;Multiball&quot;: This occurs when there is more than one ball in play at a time and usually includes some kind of jackpot scoring. Multiball ends when all but one ball is lost down the bottom of the playfield, and then regular play resumes.
* &quot;Jackpot&quot;: Some targets on the playfield increase the scoring value of something else, which could be as simple as hitting a ramp, or a complicated sequence of targets. Upon their inception, the jackpot was the main goal of most pinball machines in the 1980s. Jackpots would often range from one to four million (back when this was a significant addition to the score), and their value would accrue between games until it was scored. Scoring it was usually a complicated task. Modern games often dilute the meaning of &quot;jackpot&quot;. Modern games give off several jackpots in each multiball mode, which is usually quite easy to attain, and the value of today&#x27;s jackpots is far less significant. Many jackpots awarded during special modes often do not increase at all, but are instead simply fixed-value bonuses.
* &quot;End-of-ball bonus&quot;: After each ball is played, the player scores bonus points depending on how many times certain features have been activated or the numbers of items that the player may obtain. Some games award a seemingly arbitrary number of points that depend on the number of times &quot;any&quot; switch has been hit. Virtually all games have the ability to assign a multiplier to the bonus. Most games cap the bonus multiplier at 5x or 10x, although more modern games apparently have no limit.
* &quot;Extra ball&quot;: If a player has earned this, when they lose a ball they get another one to play immediately afterward and the machine does not count the lost ball towards the limit of balls for that game. For example, if the player were on ball two and they earn an extra ball, the next ball will still be counted as ball two instead of the third ball. When a machine says &quot;SHOOT AGAIN&quot; on the scoreboard, it signifies that an extra ball will shoot. In a multiplayer game, the player who just lost the ball is the same one to shoot again.
* &quot;Kickback&quot;: When a ball goes into one of the outlane instead of draining goes into a kicker that will launch the ball back into play. Their use is limited and has to be earned to be used.
* Various timed rounds (&quot;modes&quot;): For example, if the player hit a specific target three times within the next 20 seconds, they might score several tens of millions of points for it. There are many and various time-related features in pinball. Progression through each mode is frequently accompanied by DMD animations and sound.
*&quot;Stackability&quot;: To &quot;stack&quot; means that the player can run one play mode while another mode is in progress. This strategy usually yields higher scores. A noted example of this is Williams&#x27; &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, with its Multi-Multiball feature.
* &quot;Wizard Mode&quot;: This is a special scoring mode, which is reached after meeting certain prerequisites to access this mode (e.g., finishing all modes). This is the pinball equivalent of the final boss fight in video games. Classic examples of this include Williams&#x27; &quot;Black Knight 2000&quot; (The King&#x27;s Ransom) and Midway&#x27;s &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; (Lost in the Zone). Named after The Who&#x27;s song &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;. Wizard modes come in two varieties: goal-oriented types where the player receives a huge number of points after completing a specific task, or multiball modes with 4–6 balls in play, and virtually every feature active. Some games offer both and award the latter as a condition for completing the former.
* &quot;Ball Saver&quot;: Many modern games include a feature that prevents a player from being disappointed if a ball sent into play quickly drains before substantial points have been added. This player will immediately be given another (free) ball to compensate. Electromechanical games made during the 1970s had a similar Ball Index switch system that returned a drained ball if no points were made.
* &quot;Slam Tilt&quot;: There are special tilt switches placed on the underside of the playfield, on the coin door, and (on electromechanical games) in the lower cabinet and upper cabinet, designed to prevent cheating. If a player lifts and drops, pounds, or kicks the machine and activates any slam tilt, the entire game ends immediately for all players and may go into a reset/reboot mode. These are also used on video and coin pusher games. A similar Incline Tilt prevents a player from lifting the front of the cabinet to tip the ball back up the playfield by ending his turn.

In the 1990s, game designers often put hidden, recurring images or references in their games, which became known as easter eggs. For example, Williams&#x27; designers hid cows in the video displays of the games, and Pat Lawlor would place a red button in the artwork of games he developed. The methods used to find the hidden items usually involved pressing the flipper buttons in a certain order or during specific events. Designers also included hidden messages or in-jokes; one example of this is the phrase &quot;DOHO&quot; sometimes seen quickly displayed on the dot matrix displays, a reference to &quot;Do&quot;ris &quot;Ho&quot;, the wife of then-Williams display artist Scott &quot;Matrix&quot; Slomiany. DOHO was popularly thought to be an acronym for &quot;D&quot;ocumented &quot;O&quot;ccurrence of a &quot;H&quot;idden &quot;O&quot;bject until its true meaning was revealed in a &quot;PinGame Journal&quot; article on the subject. The game &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; went so far as to embed a hidden &quot;Breakout&quot;-like game, available only after a complex sequence of events had been accomplished during the game.

==Scoring points==

Contact with or manipulation of scoring elements (such as targets or ramps) scores points for the player. Electrical switches embedded in the scoring elements detect contact and relay this information to the scoring mechanism. Older pinball machines used an electromechanical system for scoring wherein a pulse from a switch would cause a complex mechanism composed of relays to ratchet up the score. In later games these tasks have been taken over by semiconductor chips and displays are made on electronic segmented or dot-matrix displays (DMD). The first DMD on a pinball machine was used by &quot;Checkpoint&quot; and features also video mode minigames.

MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of Inder&#x27;s original &quot;Canasta&quot; titled &quot;New Canasta&quot;, with an LCD screen in the backbox in 2010.&quot; The Wizard of Oz&quot; is the first US pinball machine that used a LCD in the back box. It is used for scoring and mini-games and to display full color videos. Other display innovations on pinball machines include pinball video game hybrids like &quot;Baby Pac-Man&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Granny and the Gators&quot; in 1984 and the use of a small color video monitor for scoring and minigames in the backbox of the pinball machine &quot;Dakar&quot; from manufacturer Mr. Game in 1988 and CGA color monitors in Pinball 2000 in 1999 that uses a Pepper&#x27;s ghost technique to reflect the monitor in the head of the as well as modifications by the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color DMDs.

Pinball scoring can be peculiar and varies greatly from machine to machine. During the 1930s and the 1940s, lights mounted behind the painted backglasses were used for scoring purposes, making the scoring somewhat arbitrary. Frequently the lights represented scores in the hundreds of thousands. During the 1950s and 1960s when the scoring mechanism was limited to mechanical wheels, high scores were frequently only in the hundreds &quot;or&quot; thousands. In an effort to keep with the traditional high scores attained with the painted backglass games, the first pinball machines to use mechanical wheels for scoring, such as &quot;Army Navy&quot;, allowed the score to reach into the millions by adding a number of permanent zeros to the end of the score.

The average score changed again in the 1970s with the advent of electronic displays. Average scores soon began to commonly increase back into tens or hundreds of thousands. Since then, there has been a trend of scoring inflation, with modern machines often requiring scores of over a billion points to win a free game. At the peak of this trend, Williams No Fear: Dangerous Sports and Jack-Bot have been played into ten billions and Williams &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; and Bally/Midway &quot;Attack from Mars&quot;, have been played into one hundred billion.

The 1997 Bally game &quot;NBA Fastbreak&quot; which, true to its theme, awards points in terms of a real basketball score: Each successful shot can give from one to three points. Getting a hundred points by the end of a game is considered respectable, which makes it one of the &quot;lowest&quot; scoring pinball machines of all time. The inflated scores are the source of one of the Spanish-language names of pinball machines, (&quot;million machine&quot;).

===Special scores===
* High score lists: If a player attains one of the highest scores ever (or the highest score on a given day), they are invited to add their initials to a displayed list of high-scorers on that particular machine. &quot;Bragging rights&quot; associated with being on the high-score list are a powerful incentive for experienced players to master a new machine.
Pinball designers also entice players with the chance to win a free game or credit. Ways to get a free game might include the following:
* &quot;Replay&quot;: A free game is awarded if the player exceeds a specified score. Some machines allow the operator to set this score to increase with each consecutive game in which the replay score is achieved, in order to prevent a skilled player from gaining virtually unlimited play on one credit by simply achieving the same replay score in every game.
* &quot;Special&quot;: A mechanism to get a free game during play is usually called a &quot;special&quot;. Typically, some hard-to-reach feature of the game will light the outlanes (the areas to the extreme left and right of the flippers) for special. Since the outlanes always lose the ball, having &quot;special&quot; there makes it worth shooting for them (and is usually the only time, if this is the case).
* &quot;Match&quot;: At the end of the game, if a set digit of the player&#x27;s score matches a random digit, a free game is awarded. In earlier machines, the set digit was usually the ones place; after a phenomenon often referred to as &quot;score inflation&quot; had happened (causing almost all scores to end in 0), the set digit was usually the tens place. The chances of a match appear to be 1 in 10, but the operator can alter this probability – the default is usually 7% in all modern Williams and Bally games for example. Other non-numeric methods are sometimes used to award a match.
* &quot;High Score&quot;: Bally/Midway, Williams and Stern Pinball machines award 1–3 free games if a player gets on the high score list. Typically, one or two credits are awarded for a 1st–4th place listing, and three for the Grand Champion.

When a free game is won, Williams and Bally/Midway machines typically makes a single loud bang, most often with a solenoid that strikes a piece of metal, or the side of the cabinet, with a rod, known as a &quot;knocker&quot;, or less commonly with loudspeakers. &quot;Knocking&quot; is the act of winning a free game when the knocker makes the loud and distinctive noise.

==Playing techniques==
The primary skill of pinball involves application of the proper timing and technique to the operation of the flippers, nudging the playfield when appropriate without tilting, and choosing targets for scores or features. A placard is often placed in a lower corner of the playfield with pricing information and details about game-specific rules and scoring techniques.

===Nudging===
Players can influence the movement of the ball by moving or bumping the pinball machine, a technique known as &quot;nudging&quot; or &quot;shaking&quot;.

There are tilt mechanisms which guard against excessive manipulation of this sort. The mechanisms generally include:
* a grounded plumb bob centered in an electrified metal ring – when the machine is jostled or shaken too far or too hard, the bob contacts the ring, completing a circuit. The bob is usually cone-shaped allowing the operator to slide it vertically, controlling the sensitivity.
* an electrified ball on a slight ramp with a grounded post at the top of the ramp – when the front of the machine is lifted (literally, tilted) too high, the ball rolls to the top of the ramp and completes the circuit.
* an impact sensor – usually located on the coin door, the playfield and/or the cabinet itself.

When any of these sensors is activated, the game registers a &quot;tilt&quot; and the lights go out, solenoids for the flippers no longer work, and other playfield systems become inoperative so that the ball can do nothing other than roll down the playfield directly to the drain. A tilt will usually result in forfeiting the end-of-ball bonus points that would have been earned by the player during that ball; the game is automatically over if it is the last ball and the player has no extra ball. Older games would immediately end the ball in play on a tilt.

Modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing the ball in play. The number of tilt warnings can be adjusted by the operator of the machine. Until recently most games also had a &quot;slam tilt&quot; switch which guarded against kicking or slamming the coin mechanism, or for overly aggressive behavior with the machine, which could give a false indication that a coin had been inserted, thereby giving a free game or credit. This feature was taken out by default in Stern S.A.M System games, but can be added as an option. A slam tilt will typically end the current game for all players.

===Trapping===
Players can hold a ball in place with the flipper, giving them more control over where they want to place the ball when they shoot it forward. This is known as &quot;trapping.&quot;

==Manufacturing process==

The assembly of a pinball machine is a complex process and involves several manual steps.

The wiring for the game&#x27;s electronic system is a major effort. A color-coded flexible wiring harness is typically soldered to many lamps, switches and solenoids, and connected with plugs to the main electronic circuit boards in modern machines. Technicians are guided by a set of instructions and templates to ensure all wires (that can have a total length of almost half a mile) are installed properly.

The main construction on one hand involves the mounting of mechanical components onto the wooden playfield, such as hammering in anchored metal railing that keeps the balls from exiting the playfield and attachment of plastic parts with nuts and screws. On the other hand, electrical components are installed, like bumpers, slingshots, and sockets for lamps and flashing lights. All of the wiring is fastened to the playfield and big components like speakers, mains transformers or shaker motors are bolted into the bottom of the cabinet. The player-accessible parts like the spring plunger, buttons and the coin door with its mechanics are attached directly to the cabinet.

After successful testing, the playfield is set on hinges into the cabinet. The cabinet of computerized games contains very few parts. On older electromechanical games, the entire floor of the lower box was used to mount custom relays and special scoring switches, making them much heavier. To protect the top of the playfield, tempered glass is slid into side rails and secured with a metal locking bar.

The backbox is installed with hinges on modern machines or screws on older games. It contains the scoring displays and electronic circuit boards and is historically covered with a removable, painted, partially transparent, backglass which defined the game&#x27;s appeal as much as the playfield design and the cabinet art. Since a damaged backglass is hard to restore, newer games use (sometimes optional) plastic translites behind a clear glass.

Other steps include installation of removable boards with speaker and dot-matrix displays and/or hinged wooden boards with lights and displays. The cabinet and backbox are covered with artwork that was historically sprayed on with stencils and later is applied as full-size decal stickers.

===Solenoids===
* &quot;Solenoids or coils&quot;: These are found in every modern pinball machine since the flipper age. They are usually hidden under the playfield, or covered by playfield components. By applying power to the coil, the magnetic field created by electromagnetism causes a metal object (usually called a plunger) to move. The plunger is then connected mechanically to a feature or accessory on the playfield.

Flipper solenoids contain two coil windings in one package; a short, heavy gage &#x27;power&#x27; winding to give the flipper its initial thrust up, and a long, light gage &#x27;hold&#x27; winding that uses lower power (and creates far less heat) and essentially just holds the flipper up allowing the player to capture the ball in the inlane for more precise aiming. As the flipper nears the end of its upward travel, a switch under the flipper disconnects the power-winding and leaves only the second sustain winding to hold the flipper up in place. If this switch fails &#x27;open&#x27; the flipper will be too weak to be usable, since only the weak winding is available. If it fails &#x27;closed&#x27; the coil will overheat and destroy itself, since both windings will hold the flipper at the top of its stroke.

Solenoids also control pop-bumpers, kickbacks, drop target resets, and many other features on the machine. These solenoid coils contain a single coil winding. The plunger size and wire gage &amp; length are matched to the strength required for each coil to do its work, so some types are repeated throughout the game, some are not.

All solenoids and coils used on microprocessor games include a special reverse-biased diode to eliminate a high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (electromotive force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.

All but very old games use low DC voltages to power the solenoids and electronics (or relays). Some microprocessor games use high voltages (potentially hazardous) for the score displays. Very early games used low-voltage AC power for solenoids, requiring fewer components, but AC is less efficient for powering solenoids, causing heavier wiring and slower performance. For locations that suffer from low AC wall outlet voltage, additional taps may be provided on the AC transformer in electromechanical games to permit raising the game&#x27;s DC voltage levels, thus strengthening the solenoids. Microprocessor games have electronic power supplies that automatically compensate for inaccurate AC supply voltages.

Historically, pinball machines have employed a central fixed I/O board connected to the primary CPU controlled by a custom microcontroller platform running an in-house operating system. For a variety of reasons that include thermal flow, reliability, vibration reduction and serviceability, I/O electronics have been located in the upper backbox of the game, requiring significant custom wiring harnesses to connect the central I/O board to the playfield devices.

A typical pinball machine I/O mix includes 16 to 24 outputs for driving solenoids, motors, electromagnets and other mechanical devices in the game. These devices can draw up to 500 W momentarily and operate at voltages up to 50 Vdc. There is also individually controlled lighting that consists of 64 to 96 individually addressable lights. Recently developed games have switched from incandescent bulbs to LEDs. And there is general illumination lighting that comprises two or more higher-power light strings connected and controlled in parallel for providing broad illumination to the playfield and backbox artwork. Additionally, 12 to 24 high-impulse lighting outputs, traditionally incandescent but now LED, provide flash effects within the game. Traditionally, these were often controlled by solenoid-level drivers.

A game typically includes 64 to 96 TTL-level inputs from a variety of sensors such as mechanical leaf switches, optical sensors and electromagnetic sensors. Occasionally extra signal conditioning is necessary to adapt custom sensors, such as eddy sensors, to the system TTL inputs.

Recently, some pinball manufacturers have replaced some of the discrete control wiring with standard communication buses. In one case, the pinball control system might include a custom embedded network node bus, a custom embedded Linux-based software stack, and a 48-V embedded power distribution system.

===Custom machines===
Some hobbyists and small companies modify existing pinball machines or create their own custom pinball machines. Some want, for example, a game with a specific subject or theme that cannot be bought in this form or was never built at all. Some custom games are built by using the programmable P-ROC controller board. Modifications include the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color dot-matrix displays or the addition of features, e.g. figures or other toys.

A few notable examples of custom pinball machines include a &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme machine, a &quot;Matrix&quot; style game, Bill Paxton Pinball, &quot;Sonic&quot;, &quot;Star Fox&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot;, and Iron man machines.

Data East was one of the few regular pinball companies that manufactured custom pinball games (e.g. for Aaron Spelling, Michael Jordan and the movie &quot;Richie Rich&quot;), though these were basically mods of existing or soon to be released pinball machines (e.g. &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; or &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy Pinball Wizard&quot;).

==Competitions==
Two Pinball World Championships were held in the Washington, D.C. area in 1972 and 1973 under the auspices of the World Pinball Association which also published a newsletter carrying results of regional tournaments.

In 1974, students at Jersey City State College wanted to make pinball playing a varsity school sport, like football was, so they started a Pinball Club Team to compete against clubs at other schools. They asked two other schools to participate. St. Peter&#x27;s College took up the challenge, while the other school did not.

Many pinball leagues have formed, with varying levels of competitiveness, formality and structure. These leagues exist everywhere from the Free State Pinball Association (FSPA) in the Washington, D.C. area to the Tokyo Pinball Organization (TPO) in Japan. In the late 1990s, game manufacturers added messages to some games encouraging players to join a local league, providing website addresses for prospective league players to investigate.

Competitive pinball has become increasingly popular in recent years, with the relaunch of both the Professional and Amateur Pinball Association (PAPA) and the International Flipper Pinball Association (IFPA).

Two different systems for ranking pinball players exist. The World Pinball Player Rankings (WPPR) was created by the IFPA. The WPPR formula takes into account the quantity and quality of the players in the field, and awards points based on that calculation for the nearly 200 IFPA endorsed events worldwide. PAPA manages a ranking system known as the PAPA Advanced Rating System (PARS), which uses the Glicko Rating System to mathematically analyze the results of more than 100,000 competitive matches. Since 2008 the IFPA has held a World Championship tournament, inviting the top-ranked WPPR players to compete; the 2019 title holder was Johannes Ostermeier of Germany.

PAPA also designates the winner of the A Division in the annual PAPA World Pinball Championships as the World Pinball Champion. Current Junior (16 and under) and Senior (50 and over) World Champions are Joshua Henderson and Paul McGlone, respectively. Samuel Ogden has become one of the most memorable champions in the PAPA tournaments, winning four straight competitions from 2004 to 2008 in the 50 and over category.

In 2018, the IFPA and Stern Pinball created the Stern Pro Circuit. The top 32 qualifiers in this series are invited to the Stern Pro Circuit Final for an invitation-only, no-entry-fee-required event where all contestants who qualify win prize money.

The popularity of competitive pinball continues to increase with widely adopted tournament rules, standard competition formats and guides for new players.

==Video game simulations==
Simulating a pinball machine has also been a popular theme of video games. Chicago Coin&#x27;s &quot;TV Pingame&quot; (1973) was a digital version of pinball that had a vertical playfield with a paddle at the bottom, controlled by a dial, with the screen filled with simple squares to represent obstacles, bumpers and pockets. This inspired a number of clones, including &quot;TV Flipper&quot; (1973) by Midway Manufacturing, Exidy&#x27;s &quot;TV Pinball&quot; (1974), and &quot;Pin Pong&quot; (1974) by Atari, Inc. The latter replaced the dial controls with button controls.

Other early pinball video games include Toru Iwatani&#x27;s &quot;Gee Bee&quot; (1978), &quot;Bomb Bee&quot; (1979), and &quot;Cutie Q&quot; (1979), Tehkan&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Pinball Action&quot; (1985), the Atari 2600 game &quot;Video Pinball&quot; (1980), and &quot;David&#x27;s Midnight Magic&quot; (1982). Bill Budge&#x27;s &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot;, released for the Apple II in 1983, allowed the user to create their own simulated pinball machine and play it.

Most early simulations were top-down 2D. As processor and graphics capabilities have improved, more accurate ball physics and 3D pinball simulations have become possible. Tilting has also been simulated, which can be activated using one or more keys (sometimes the space bar) for &quot;moving&quot; the machine. Flipper button computer peripherals were also released, allowing pinball fans to add an accurate feel to their game play instead of using the keyboard or mouse. Modern pinball video games are often based around established franchises such as &quot;Metroid Prime Pinball&quot;, &quot;Mario Pinball Land&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot;, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot;.

Popular pinball simulations of the 1990s include &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot;, &quot;Pro Pinball&quot; and &quot;3D Pinball: Space Cadet&quot; that was included in Windows 2000 and Windows XP. More recent examples include &quot;Pinball FX&quot;, &quot;Pinball FX 2&quot;, and &quot;Pinball FX 3&quot;.

There have been pinball programs released for all major home video game and computer systems, tablet computers and smart phones. Pinball video game engines and editors for creation and recreation of pinball machines include for instance &quot;Visual Pinball&quot;, &quot;Future Pinball&quot; and &quot;Unit3D Pinball&quot;.

A BBC News article described virtual pinball games e.g. &quot;Zen Pinball&quot; and &quot;The Pinball Arcade&quot; as a way to preserve pinball culture and bring it to new audiences. Another example of preserving historic pinball machines is &quot;Zaccaria Pinball&quot; that consists of digital recreations of classic Zaccaria pinball machines.

==In popular culture==

Perhaps the most famous media about pinball is the rock opera album &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) by The Who, which centers on the title character, a &quot;deaf, dumb, and blind kid&quot;, who becomes a &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; and who later uses pinball as a symbol and tool for his messianic mission. The album was subsequently made into a movie and stage musical. The movie features a Gottlieb &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; machine and Gottlieb &quot;Buckaroo&quot; machine. &quot;Wizard&quot; has since moved into popular usage as a term for an expert pinball player.

<text>Year 195 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Flaccus and Cato (or, less frequently, year 559 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 195 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Carthage ====
* Because of his administrative and constitutional reforms in Carthage, Hannibal becomes unpopular with an important faction of the Carthaginian nobility and he is denounced to the Romans for inciting the Seleucid king Antiochus III to take up arms against the Romans. Rome demands that Carthage surrender Hannibal. However, Hannibal voluntarily goes into exile.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Tensions between Antiochus III and Rome increase when Hannibal is given refuge by Antiochus III at Ephesus and becomes his adviser.
* After Roman diplomatic intervention, Antiochus III finally halts his war with Egypt. In the peace agreement (the Peace of Lysimachia), Antiochus III formally takes possession of southern Syria, which has been fought over for 100 years by the Ptolemies and Seleucids, and also takes possession of the Egyptian territories in Anatolia.

==== Roman Republic ====
* A Spanish revolt against Roman consolidation of the ex-Carthaginian colonies is effectively put down by Marcus Porcius Cato (&quot;the Censor&quot;). He avoids one defeat by paying the Celtiberians 200 talents (around 120,000 denarii), a much-criticised tactic. On Cato&#x27;s return to Rome, Aemilius Paulus succeeds him as Roman governor in Spain.
* The Roman sumptuary law, the Lex Oppia, which restricts not only a woman&#x27;s wealth, but also her display of wealth, is repealed despite consul Marcus Porcius Cato&#x27;s strong opposition.

==== Greece ====
* The Battle of Gythium is fought between Sparta and a coalition of Rome, Rhodes, the Achaean League and Pergamum. As the port of Gythium is an important Spartan base, the allies decide to capture it before they advance inland to Sparta. The Romans and the Acheans are joined outside the city by the Pergamese and Rhodian fleets. The Spartans hold out; however, the proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus arrives with 4,000 extra men. Facing too great an army, the Spartans decide to surrender the city on the condition that the garrison can leave unharmed. As a result, Nabis, the tyrant of Sparta, is forced to abandon the surrounding land and withdraw to the city of Sparta. Later that year, Sparta capitulates to the allies.

==== Egypt ====
* Aristophanes of Byzantium, Greek scholar, critic and grammarian, becomes the chief librarian at Alexandria.

==== China ====
* Facing the suspicion of Emperor Gaozu of Han, Lu Wan, the king of the State of Yan, flees north of the Great Wall of China. 
* Gaozu sends general Fan Kuai to seek out Lu Wan but then arrests the general on suspicion of planning to murder Consort Qi and her son to Gaozu, Liu Ruyi. Gaozu dies soon after, and Fan&#x27;s sister-in-law Empress Lü orders his release.
* Chang&#x27;an, the capital of China, is thought to become the largest city in the world at this time, taking over from Pataliputra, the capital of the Mauryan empire.

==== Korea ====
* Haemosu Dangun, the first ruler of Buyeo, dies and his son Mosuri Dangun succeeds him to the throne.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Mithridates I (or Mithradates), &quot;Great King&quot; of Parthia from about 171 BC who turned Parthia into a major political power and expanded the empire westward into Mesopotamia (d. 138 BC)
* Terence or Publius Terentius Afer, Roman comic playwright (approximate date) (d. 159 BC)

== Deaths ==
* June 1 – Gaozu of Han (or Gao), first emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty, who has ruled since 202 BC (b. 256 or 247 BC)

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* After his election to the consulship, Titus Quinctius Flamininus is chosen to replace Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus as the leading Roman general in Macedonia. He then crosses into Macedonia with his army. Flamininus realizes that future peace depends on breaking the power of king Philip V of Macedon, not merely humbling him. He secures the backing of the Achaean League and then opens peace negotiations with Philip at Nicaea in Locris. Though peace proposals are submitted to the Roman Senate, the talks break down, and fighting resumes.
* Titus Quinctius Flamininus&#x27; forces manage to push Philip V out of most of Greece, except for a few fortresses. He then defeats Philip V in the Battle of the Aous, near modern Tepelenë in Albania.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The Battle of Panium is fought between Seleucid forces led by Antiochus III and Ptolemaic forces led by Scopas of Aetolia. The Seleucids win the battle which allows Antiochus III to obtain entire possession of Palestine and Coele-Syria from King Ptolemy V of Egypt. Though the Romans send ambassadors to Ptolemy V, they are unable to lend him any serious assistance against Antiochus III.
* In the resulting peace, Antiochus III agrees to give his daughter Cleopatra in marriage to Ptolemy V.

==== China ====
* Following the defeat of the Han at the hands of Modu Chanyu of the Xiongnu at Baideng in 200 BC, courtier Liu Jing (劉敬) is dispatched by Han emperor Gaozu for negotiations. The peace settlement eventually reached between the parties includes a Han princess given in marriage to the chanyu (called heqin 和親 or &quot;harmonious kinship&quot;); periodic tribute of silk, liquor and rice to the Xiongnu; equal status between the states; and the Great Wall as mutual border. This treaty sets the pattern for relations between the Han and the Xiongnu for some sixty years.

<doc id="60511" wikidata="Q1354914" url="?curid=60511" title="Parrot virtual machine">
<text>Parrot is a discontinued register-based process virtual machine designed to run dynamic languages efficiently. It is possible to compile Parrot assembly language and Parrot intermediate representation (PIR, an intermediate language) to Parrot bytecode and execute it. Parrot is free and open-source software.

Parrot was started by the Perl community and developed with help from the open-source and free software communities. As a result, it was focused on license compatibility with Perl (Artistic License 2.0), platform compatibility across a broad array of systems, processor architecture compatibility across most modern processors, speed of execution, small size (around 700k depending on platform), and the flexibility to handle the varying demands made by Raku and other modern dynamic languages.

Version 1.0, with a stable application programming interface (API) for development, was released on March 17, 2009. The last version is release 8.1.0 &quot;Andean Parakeet&quot;. Parrot was officially discontinued in August 2021, after being supplanted by MoarVM in its main use (Raku) and never becoming a mainstream VM for any of its other supported languages.

==History==
The name &quot;Parrot&quot; came from an April Fool&#x27;s joke which announced a hypothetical language, named &quot;Parrot&quot;, that would unify Python and Perl. The name was later adopted by the Parrot project (initially a part of the Raku development effort) which aimed to support Raku, Python, and other programming languages.

The Parrot Foundation was dissolved in 2014. The Foundation was created in 2008 to hold the copyright and trademarks of the Parrot project, to help drive development of language implementations and the core codebase, to provide a base for growing the Parrot community, and to reach out to other language communities.

Historical design decisions are documented in the form of Parrot Design Documents, or PDDs, in the Parrot repository.

Until late 2005, Dan Sugalski was the lead designer and chief architect of Parrot. Chip Salzenberg, a longtime Perl, Linux kernel, and C++ hacker, took over until mid-2006, when he became the lead developer. Allison Randal, the lead developer of Punie and chief architect of Parrot&#x27;s compiler tools, was the chief architect until mid-October 2010 when she stepped down and chose Christoph Otto as the new chief architect.

==Languages==
The goal of the Parrot virtual machine was to host client languages and allow inter-operation between them. Several hurdles exist in accomplishing this goal, in particular the difficulty of mapping high-level concepts, data, and data structures between languages.

===Static and dynamic languages===
The differing properties of statically and dynamically typed languages motivated the design of Parrot. Current popular virtual machines such as the Java virtual machine and the Common Language Runtime, for the .NET platform, have been designed for statically typed languages, while the languages targeted by Parrot are dynamically typed.

Virtual machines such as the Java virtual machine and the current Perl 5 virtual machine are also stack based. Parrot developers chose a register-based design, reasoning that it more closely resembles a hardware design, allowing the vast literature on compiler optimization to be used in generating bytecode for the Parrot virtual machine that could run at speeds closer to machine code. Other register-based virtual machines inspired parts of Parrot&#x27;s design, including LLVM, the Lua VM and Inferno&#x27;s Dis.

===Functional concepts===
Parrot has rich support for several features of functional programming including closures and continuations, both of which can be particularly difficult to implement correctly and portably, especially in conjunction with exception handling and threading. The biggest advantage is the dynamic extendability of objects with methods, which allows for &quot;polymorphic containers&quot; (PMCs) and associated opcodes. Implementing solutions to these problems at the virtual machine level obviates the need to solve them in the individual client languages.

===Compiler tools===

Parrot provides a suite of compiler-writing tools which includes the Parser Grammar Engine (PGE), a hybrid parser-generator that can express a recursive descent parser as well as an operator-precedence parser, allowing free transition between the two in a single grammar. The PGE feeds into the Tree Grammar Engine (TGE) which further transforms the parse-tree generated by PGE for optimization and ultimately for code generation.

===Implementations===
The most complete language implementations targeting the Parrot VM were Raku (known at the time as Rakudo Perl 6), Lua and a new language called &quot;Winxed&quot;. Projects to implement many other languages were started, including PHP, Python, and Ruby; along with esoteric and demonstration languages such as Befunge and the &quot;&quot; tutorial language. None of these projects were successful in becoming the primary implementation of their respective languages.

==Internals==
There are three forms of program code for Parrot:
* &quot;Bytecode&quot; is binary and is natively interpreted by Parrot. Bytecode is usually stored in files with the filename extension &quot;.pbc&quot;.
* &quot;Parrot assembly language&quot; (PASM) is the low level language that compiles down to bytecode. PASM code is usually stored in files with the filename extension &quot;.pasm&quot;.
* &quot;Parrot intermediate representation&quot; (PIR) is a slightly higher level language than PASM and also compiles down to bytecode. It is the primary target of language implementations. PIR transparently manages Parrot&#x27;s inter-routine calling conventions, provides improved syntax, register allocation, and more. PIR code is usually stored in files with the filename extension &quot;.pir&quot;.

==Examples==

===Registers===
Parrot is register-based like most hardware CPUs, and unlike most virtual machines, which are stack-based. Parrot provides four types of registers:

* I: native integer type
* N: floating-point numbers
* S: advanced string registers with Unicode support
* P: PMC, or &quot;Polymorphic Container&quot; — Parrot object type

Parrot provides an arbitrary number of registers; this number is fixed at compile time per subroutine.

===Arithmetic operations===
In PASM

 set I1, 4
 inc I1 # I1 is now 5
 add I1, 2 # I1 is now 7
 set N1, 42.0
 dec N1 # N1 is now 41.0
 sub N1, 2.0 # N1 is now 39.0
 print I1
 print &#x27;, &#x27;
 print N1
 print &quot;\n&quot;
 end

In PIR

 .sub &#x27;main&#x27; :main
 $I1 = 4
 inc $I1 # $I1 is now 5
 $I1 += 2 # $I1 is now 7
 $N1 = 42.0
 dec $N1 # $N1 is now 41.0
 $N1 -= 2.0 # $N1 now 39.0
 print $I1
 print &#x27;, &#x27;
 print $N1
 print &quot;\n&quot;
 .end
==mod_parrot==
mod_parrot is an optional module for the Apache web server. It embeds a Parrot virtual machine interpreter into the Apache server and provides access to the Apache API to allow handlers to be written in Parrot assembly language, or any high-level language targeted to Parrot.

<text>Year 197 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Cethegus and Rufus (or, less frequently, year 557 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 197 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Asia Minor ====
* Eumenes II becomes King of Pergamum following the death of his father Attalus I Soter.
* Antiochus III occupies parts of the kingdom of Pergamum and a number of Greek cities in Anatolia.

==== Egypt ====
* The Egyptian King, Ptolemy V, fights rebels in the Nile Delta, exhibiting great cruelty toward those of their leaders who capitulate.

==== Greece ====
* The Spartan ruler, Nabis, acquires the important city of Argos from Philip V of Macedon, as the price of his alliance with the Macedonians. Nabis then defects to the Romans in the expectation of being able to hold on to his conquest.
* The Battle of Cynoscephalae in Thessaly gives a Roman army under proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus a decisive victory over Philip V of Macedon. In the Treaty of Tempe, the terms of the peace proposed by the Roman general and adopted by the Roman Senate specify that Philip V can retain his throne and control of Macedonia, but he has to abandon all the Greek cities he has conquered. Philip also has to provide to the Romans 1,000 talents as indemnity, surrender most of his fleet and provide hostages, including his younger son, Demetrius, who is to be held in Rome. The Aetolians propose that Philip V be ejected from his throne but Flamininus opposes this.
* The volcanic island of Hiera emerges from under the sea near Thera.

====Hispania====
* Hispania is divided into Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior.
* The Iberian revolt breaks out in Citerior and Ulterior against Roman domination.

====China====
* Chen Xi begins a rebellion against the Han dynasty in the Dai region of the northern frontier.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Attalus I Soter, ruler of Pergamum from 241 BC, who has taken on the title of king after about 230 BC. Through his military and diplomatic skills, he has created a powerful kingdom in Anatolia (b. 269 BC)
* Liu Taigong, Chinese emperor of the Han dynasty

<text>Year 196 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Purpureo and Marcellus (or, less frequently, year 558 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 196 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Roman Republic ====
* The Insubres, Gauls of the Po Valley, believed by the Romans to have been incited to revolt by Carthage, are finally defeated.
* A new category of Roman priests, the tresviri epulones, are elected to supervise the feasts of the gods; the first three men selected are Gaius Licinius Lucullus, Publius Manlius, and Publius Porcius Laeca.
* At the Isthmian Games at Corinth, the Roman proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus proclaims that all Greeks are to be free and governed by their own laws. For this deed he is hailed in many Greek cities as a saviour and accorded homage alongside the gods.
* Flamininus accuses the Spartan ruler, Nabis, of tyranny, takes Gythium in Laconia and forces Nabis to surrender Argos.
* The first triumphal arch built in Rome.

==== Anatolia ====
* According to the Roman scholar and writer Marcus Terentius Varro, the foundation of a library at Pergamum around this time by Eumenes II of Pergamum, combined with an embargo on papyrus by Ptolemy V, leads to the invention of parchment.

==== Egypt ====
* The Rosetta Stone is created. This stone is a Ptolemaic era stele written with the same text in two Egyptian language scripts (hieroglyphic and demotic) and in classical Greek. The translation of the Greek passage reveals that the inscription is a royal edict recording the benefits conferred on Egypt by the pharaoh Ptolemy V Epiphanes at the time of his coronation. This stone will provide the key to the hieroglyphic, or pictographic writing, of ancient Egypt and the decree on it reveals the increasing influence of Egyptian natives, remitted debts and taxes, released prisoners, pardoned rebels who have surrendered, and granted increased benefactions to the temples.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Antiochus III&#x27;s army crosses the Hellespont into Thrace, where he claims sovereignty over territory that has been won by Seleucus I in 281 BC. A war of harassment and diplomacy with Rome ensues. The Romans send ambassadors demanding that Antiochus stay out of Greece and set free all the autonomous communities in Anatolia. To meet these demands would mean Antiochus III giving up the western part of his Seleucid Empire. Thus Antiochus refuses the Romans&#x27; demands.

==== China ====
* Empress Lü and Prime Minister Xiao He of the Han dynasty have the former General-in-Chief Han Xin executed, suspecting that he was planning a rebellion in cooperation with the rebel Chen Xi.
* Emperor Gaozu of Han and his generals, including Cao Shen and Zhou Bo, defeat the rebellion of Chen Xi.
* A Han army defeats a raid on the northern frontier by the rogue Xin of Han. Xin is killed in battle.
* Gaozu deposes the king of Liang, Peng Yue, on suspicion of conspiracy. He is then executed on the orders of Empress Lü.
* The king of Huainan, Ying Bu, fearing execution, rebels against the Han dynasty. Gaozu and Cao Shen crush the rebellion but Gaozu is wounded by an arrow, and his health subsequently deteriorates.
* Increasingly paranoid, Gaozu briefly arrests Prime Minister Xiao He but is persuaded to release him.
* Gaozu sends Zhao Tuo, the king of Nanyue in present-day Vietnam and southern China, a seal recognizing his rulership in return for his nominal submission to the Han. Zhao Tuo accepts his vassal status.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Han Xin, Chinese general during the Chu–Han Contention
* Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, Roman consul and censor
* Peng Yue, Chinese general of the Western Han dynasty
* Xin, Chinese king during the Warring States period

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The Achaeans respond to Sparta&#x27;s renewed interest in recovering lost territory by sending an envoy to Rome with a request for help. In response, the Roman Senate sends the praetor Atilius with a navy, as well as an embassy headed by Titus Quinctius Flamininus.
* Not waiting for the Roman fleet to arrive, the Achaean army and navy head towards Gythium under the command of Philopoemen. The Achaean fleet under Tiso is defeated by the Spartan fleet. On land, the Achaeans are unable to defeat the Spartan forces outside Gythium and Philopoemen retreats to Tegea.
* When Philopoemen reenters Laconia for a second attempt, his forces are ambushed by the Spartan tyrant, Nabis, but nevertheless Philopoemen manages to gain a victory over the Spartan forces.
* Philopoemen&#x27;s plans for capturing Sparta itself are put on hold at the request of the Roman envoy Flaminius after his arrival in Greece. In return, Nabis decides, for the moment, to accept the status quo.
* Nabis then appeals to the Aetolians for help. They send 1,000 cavalry under the command of Alexamenus to Sparta. However, the Aetolians murder Nabis and temporarily occupy Sparta. The Aetolian troops seize the palace and set about looting the city, but the inhabitants of Sparta are able to rally and force them leave the city. Philopoemen, however, takes advantage of the Aetolian treachery and enters Sparta with his Achaean army. Now in full control of Sparta, Philopoemen forces Sparta to become a member state of the Achaean League.
* Seleucid forces under their king, Antiochus III, invade Greece at the invitation of the Aetolian League, who are revolting against the Romans. The Aetolians appoint him commander in chief of their league. Antiochus lands in Demetrias, Thessaly with only 10,500 men and occupies Euboea. However, he finds little support for his cause in central Greece.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

* Nabis, tyrant and last independent ruler (from 207 BC) of Sparta

<text>Year 191 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Nasica and Glabrio (or, less frequently, year 563 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 191 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Roman Republic ====
* The Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio and Cato the Elder cut the Seleucid king Antiochus III off from his reinforcements in Thrace and outflank his position at the pass of Thermopylae in the Battle of Thermopylae. With the remainder of his troops, Antiochus flees to Chalcis on Euboea and from there he retreats by sea to Ephesus.
* Manius Acilius Glabrio then turns his attention to the Aetolian League, which has persuaded Antiochus to declare war against Rome, and is only prevented from crushing them by the intercession of Titus Quinctius Flamininus.
* Scipio Africanus persuades the Roman Senate to continue the war against Antiochus III by making him the chief commander and allowing him and his brother, Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, to follow Antiochus into Anatolia.
* The Roman calendar, which is four months ahead of the seasons, is adjusted (by &quot;Lex Acilia de intercalando&quot;).
* Cisalpine Gaul becomes a Roman province.

==== Carthage ====
* The Carthaginians manage to collect the indemnity due to Rome (through the peace treaty signed between them ten years earlier) but not payable in full for 50 years. The Romans, in order to keep their hold on Carthage, refuse to accept the early payment of the indemnity.

==== Parthia ====
* Arsaces II, king of Parthia, is considered to have been murdered on the orders of Antiochus III. Arsaces is succeeded by his cousin Phriapatius.

==== China ====
* Emperor Hui of Han lifts the ban on Confucian writings ordered in 213 BC.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Arsaces II, King of Parthia, who had reigned from about 211 BC (murdered)

<text>Year 190 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Asiaticus and Laelius (or, less frequently, year 564 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 190 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The Battle of the Eurymedon is fought between a Seleucid fleet and ships from Rhodes and Pergamum, who are allied with the Roman Republic. The Seleucids are led by the famous Carthaginian general Hannibal. The Rhodians and their allies are victorious and Hannibal&#x27;s fleet is forced to flee.
* Subsequently, the naval Battle of Myonessus is fought between a Seleucid fleet and a Roman fleet with the help of Rhodian ships. The Romans and their allies are victorious.
* As Philip V of Macedon has aided Rome against her enemies on the Greek peninsula, his tribute to Rome is remitted and his son, Demetrius, is restored to him after being held hostage in Rome for a number of years.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Meeting no further resistance from the Seleucids and their allies, the Roman army under general Scipio Africanus and his brother Lucius, along with King Eumenes II of Pergamum and other allies, cross the Hellespont into Anatolia.
* With the increasingly real threat to his Empire from the Romans, Antiochus III is eager to negotiate on the basis of Rome&#x27;s previous demands, but the Romans insist that he first give up the region west of the Taurus Mountains. When Antiochus refuses, the Battle of Magnesia is fought near Magnesia ad Sipylum, on the plains of Lydia in Anatolia, between the Romans, led by the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio and his brother, Scipio Africanus, with their ally Eumenes II of Pergamum, and the army of Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire. The resulting decisive Roman victory ends the conflict with the Seleucids for the control of Greece.
* Following Antiochus III&#x27;s defeat by the Romans, two of Antiochus III&#x27;s Armenian satraps, Artaxias and Zariadres, declare themselves independent of the Seleucids. With Roman consent, they establish themselves as kings of the Kingdom of Armenia and the district of Sophene (Armenia Minor), respectively. Artaxias builds his capital, Artaxata, on the Araxes River (now the Aras River) near Lake Sevan.
* For assisting the Romans in defeating Antiochus III, Eumenes II of Pergamum is rewarded with a great increase in territory. He is given control over the Thracian Chersonese (the modern Gallipoli peninsula) and over most of the former Seleucid possessions in Anatolia.

==== Roman Republic ====
* One of the main highways in Roman Italy, the Via Appia, is extended to Benevento and Venosa.

=== By topic ===
==== Art ====
* The statue Nike (Victory) of Samothrace is created (possible date). It is discovered in 1863 and is now kept at Musée du Louvre in Paris.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
== Births ==
* Cornelia, second daughter of Scipio Africanus. She will be considered by Roman society to be the perfect example of a virtuous Roman woman (d. 100 BC)
* Hipparchus, Greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician (d. c. 120 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Apollonius of Perga, Greek mathematician, geometer and astronomer of the Alexandrian school, known by his contemporaries as &quot;The Great Geometer&quot;, whose treatise &quot;Conics&quot; is one of the greatest scientific works from the ancient world (b. c. 262 BC)
