<text>Time Enough for Love is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first published in 1973. The book made the shortlist for the Nebula, Hugo and Locus awards for best science fiction novel of that year, although it did not win. It did win a retrospective Libertarian Futurist Society award: the Prometheus Hall of Fame award for 1988.

==Plot==
The book covers several periods from the life of Lazarus Long (born Woodrow Wilson Smith), an early beneficiary of a breeding experiment designed to increase mankind&#x27;s natural lifespan. The experiment is known as the Howard Families, after the program&#x27;s initiator. Lazarus is the result of more a mutation than the breeding experiment, and he is the oldest living human at more than two thousand years old.

The first half of the book takes the form of several novellas connected by Lazarus&#x27;s retrospective narrative. In the framing story, Lazarus has decided that life is no longer worth living, but, in what is described as a reverse &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; scenario, agrees not to end his life for as long as his companion and descendant, chief executive of the Howard Families Ira Weatheral, will listen to his stories.

===&quot;The Tale of the Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail&quot;===
This story concerns a 20th-century United States Navy seaman, midshipman, and officer David Lamb, who receives multiple promotions while minimizing any semblance of real work or combat by applying himself enthusiastically to the principle of &quot;constructive laziness&quot;. 

===&quot;The Tale of the Twins Who Weren&#x27;t&quot;===
Lazarus tells of his visit as an interplanetary cargo trader to a planet, where he bought a pair of slaves, brother and sister, and immediately manumitted them. Because they had no knowledge of independent living or any education, Lazarus teaches them &quot;how to be human&quot; during the voyage.

The two were the result of an experiment in genetic recombination in which two parent cells were separated into complementary haploid gametes and recombined into two embryos. The resulting zygotes were implanted in a woman and gestated by her, with the result that although both have the same surrogate mother and genetic parents, they are no more closely related genetically than any two people taken at random. They have been prevented from sexual relations by a chastity belt. However, having confirmed that there is no risk of genetic disease in their offspring (described as the only valid argument against incest), Lazarus solemnizes their marriage and later establishes them as the owners and operators of a thriving business. At the end of the story, he reveals that the twins looked the same age decades later and expresses his belief that they were his own descendants, from an earlier time that he had been a slave on the same planet.

===&quot;The Tale of the Adopted Daughter&quot;===
A short scene-setter introduces a planet on which Lazarus has led a group of pioneering colonists.

Lazarus, now working as a banker and shopkeeper on the frontier planet and keeping his true age secret, saves a young girl, Dora, from a burning house and becomes her guardian. When she becomes an adult, he leaves the area but returns as a younger man and marries her, and the two move away to start a new settlement, where Lazarus&#x27; long life is less likely to be noticed. They eventually manage to build a thriving community. Because Dora is not a descendant of the Howard Families, the source of his longevity, she eventually dies of old age, leaving Lazarus to mourn.

===&quot;Boondock&quot;===
At the beginning of this story, Lazarus has regained his enthusiasm for life, and the remainder of the book is told in a conventional linear manner. Accompanied by some of his descendants, Lazarus has now moved to a new planet and established a polyamorous family, with three men, three women, and a larger number of children, two of whom are female clones of Lazarus.

===&quot;Da Capo&quot;===
In the concluding tale, Lazarus attempts to travel backward in time to 1919 to experience it as an adult, but an error in calculation places Lazarus in 1916, on the eve of America&#x27;s involvement in World War I. An unintentional result is that Lazarus falls in love with his own mother. To retain her esteem and that of his grandfather, Lazarus enlists in the army. Eventually, before Lazarus leaves for the war, he and his mother, Maureen, consummate their mutual attraction, as his mother is already pregnant and so accepts that there is no collateral risk.

In the trenches of the Western Front in France, he is mortally wounded, but is rescued at the last moment by his future companions from the framing story and returned to his own time.

===&quot;The Notebooks of Lazarus Long&quot;===
There are also two &quot;Intermission&quot; sections, each some six or eight pages long, taking the form of lists of provocative phrases and aphorisms not obviously related to the main narrative. They were later published independently, with illustrations, as &quot;The Notebooks of Lazarus Long&quot;.

==Themes==
What ties most of the stories together is that they are an examination and deconstruction of incest. In the context of his &quot;tales&quot; Heinlein examines the morality of a variety of possible incestuous situations: from unrelated &quot;twins&quot;, to unrelated parent-child, to distant relatives, and finally close relatives when Lazarus sleeps with his own mother. Heinlein seems to conclude that, absent genetic risk, it is not immoral at all.

==Connections to other stories==
Early in the story, one of the characters presents Lazarus with a number of activities that may be new (to him), to entice him into remaining alive and being restored to youth. One of the suggestions is to have his memory and consciousness transplanted into a female clone of himself, at which point Lazarus briefly remembers hearing of the events that occurred in &quot;I Will Fear No Evil&quot;.

Later in the book, a character reports the fate of the generation ship &quot;Vanguard&quot;, from Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Orphans of the Sky&quot;: it was found derelict in space, but the survivors (descendants of the characters from &quot;Orphans&quot;) have adopted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle on another planet.

From &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;, Lazarus offers to recount the fate of the Jockaira, but another character cuts him off, saying: &quot;Since that lie is already in his memoirs in four conflicting versions, why should we be burdened with a fifth?&quot; Long also reports the fate of the descendants of the Howards who chose to stay on the planet of the Little People. Some of the Little People alive at the time he returned to the planet harbored the memories of those Howards, including Mary Sperling; but Long&#x27;s ship reports that &quot;if there is a human artifact on the surface of that planet, it is less than a half meter in diameter&quot;.

Also, at one point reference is made to the burial in space of Andrew Jackson &quot;Slipstick&quot; Libby, co-creator of the Libby–Sheffield para-drive. Libby is the human calculator genius who first appears in the short story &quot;Misfit&quot;. Lazarus had promised Libby to return him to his native Ozarks, which comforted Libby as he died. One hundred years later, Lazarus returns to the planet around which Libby&#x27;s coffin should be in orbit, but cannot find it, despite having so equipped it that he should have. He later uses this as a &quot;time travel calibration&quot; check, and we find out what happened to Libby&#x27;s coffin in &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;.

Additionally, reference is made to Doctor Pinero, the primary character from Heinlein&#x27;s short story &quot;Life-Line&quot;; during the novel&#x27;s ending one of the characters tells Lazarus that he (Lazarus) cannot die, which aligns with the fact that Pinero (who could predict the exact time of anyone&#x27;s death) was supposedly unable to foresee the time of Lazarus&#x27;s demise.

The history of the Howard Families and Lazarus Long also feature prominently in &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; and &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;.

==Reception==
John Leonard, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; as &quot;a great entertainment&quot;, declaring that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter [that] all his characters sound and behave exactly the same; it&#x27;s because the man is a master of beguilement. He pulls so hard of the dugs of sentiment that disbelief is not merely suspended; it is abolished&quot;.

Theodore Sturgeon reviewed the novel favorably, citing &quot;the fascination of watching the mind of a man whose reach always exceeds his grasp but who will never stop reaching&quot;.

The book has been criticized for its excessive length and unpleasant promotion of incest. Kat Hooper called it a boring novel &quot;for masochists only&quot;.

<text>Sjögren&#x27;s disease (SjD) (previously known as Sjögren syndrome or Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome (SjS, SS)) is a long-term autoimmune disease that primarily affects the body&#x27;s exocrine glands, particularly the lacrimal and salivary glands. Common symptoms include dry mouth, dry eyes and often seriously affect other organ systems, such as the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system.

==Signs and symptoms==
In a 2021 article on Sjogren&#x27;s patients, a majority of individuals stated that eight Sjogren&#x27;s symptoms had a major or moderate impact on their life: fatigue (79%); dry eyes (75%); dry mouth (73%); joint pain (65%); trouble sleeping (64%); eye discomfort (60%); muscle pain (56%); and brain fog (54%).

Primary symptoms are dryness (dry mouth and dry eyes), pain and fatigue. Other symptoms can include dry skin, vaginal dryness, a chronic cough, numbness in the arms and legs, feeling tired, muscle and joint pains, and thyroid problems. Those affected are also at an increased risk (15%) of lymphoma.

The hallmark symptom of Sjögren syndrome is dry mouth and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). Vaginal dryness, dry skin, and dry nose may also occur. Other organs of the body may also be affected, including the kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, liver, pancreas, and brain.

In some people with SS, skin dryness may be the result of lymphocytic infiltration into skin glands. The symptoms may develop insidiously, with the diagnosis often not considered for several years because sicca (dryness) may be attributed to medications, a dry environment, or aging, or may be regarded as not of a severity warranting the level of investigation necessary to establish the presence of the underlying autoimmune disorder.

Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome can damage vital organs, with symptoms that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission, as with other autoimmune diseases. Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, while others have symptoms of severe disease. Many patients can treat problems symptomatically. Others experience blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen parotid glands, dysphonia (vocal disorders including hoarseness), and difficulty in swallowing and eating. Debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life. Some patients can develop kidney involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to proteinuria (excess protein in urine), urinary concentrating defect, and distal renal tubular acidosis.

=== Complications ===
Among the complications discussed above, women with anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies who become pregnant have an increased rate of neonatal lupus erythematosus with congenital heart block requiring a pacemaker. Type I cryoglobulinemia is a known complication of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome.

Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome can affect such organs as the liver, pancreas, kidneys, lungs, and central nervous system.

===Associated conditions===
Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is associated with a number of other medical conditions, many of which are autoimmune or rheumatic disorders, such as celiac disease, fibromyalgia, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis and spondyloarthropathy, and several malignancies, principally non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Sjogren&#x27;s is the second most common cause of dysautonomia.

== Causes ==

While the exact cause is unclear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetics and an environmental trigger such as exposure to a virus or bacterium. It can occur independently of other health problems (primary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome) or as a result of another connective tissue disorder (secondary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome). Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or systemic sclerosis. The inflammation that results progressively damages the glands. Diagnosis is by biopsy of moisture-producing glands and blood tests for specific antibodies. On biopsy there are typically lymphocytes within the glands.

The cause of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is unknown, but it may be the influence of a combination of genetic, environmental, and other factors, as is the case with many other autoimmune disorders. Around 20 autoantibodies could be involved.

=== Genetics ===
The observation of high rates of autoimmune disorders in families with a history of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is linked with a genetic predisposition to the syndrome. Studies on the polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and HLA-DQ gene regions in Sjögren&#x27;s patients show differential susceptibility to the syndrome as the result of different types of the resulting autoantibody production.

=== Hormones ===
Since Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is associated with a high prevalence in women, sex hormones, especially estrogen, are believed to affect humoral and cell-mediated immune responses affecting susceptibility to the syndrome. Androgens are generally considered to prevent autoimmunity. Studies on mice models suggest estrogen deficiency stimulates presentation of autoantigens, inducing Sjögren&#x27;s-like symptoms.

=== Microchimerism ===
Microchimerism of fetal cells (offspring lymphoid cells in maternal circulation) may generate autoimmunity in women who have previously been pregnant. Generation of an autoimmune potential via microchimerism may lead to a switch from a silent form of autoimmunity with age-dependent decrease in self-tolerance.

=== Environment ===
Viral proteins, engulfed molecules, or degraded self-structures may initiate autoimmunity by molecular mimicry and increase the chances of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome development. Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis C, and human T-cell leukemia virus-1 are among the most studied infectious agents in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. To date, no direct cause-and-effect relationship has been identified between these pathogens and the development of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. Damaged self-structures targeted for apoptosis may be mistakenly exposed to the immune system, triggering autoimmunity in exocrine glands, which are often prone to autoimmune responses.

== Pathogenesis ==
The pathogenetic mechanisms of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome have not been fully elucidated, resulting in the lack of pathophysiology knowledge of the management of this autoimmune exocrinopathy. Although the numerous factors contributing to the progression of this disease have made discovering the exact origin and cause difficult, major advances over the past decade have contributed to a proposed set of pathogenic events that occur before the diagnosis of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome.

Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome was originally proposed as a specific, self-perpetuating, immune system-mediated loss of exocrine glands, specifically acinar and ductal cells. Although this explains the more obvious symptoms (such as the lack of saliva and lacrimal fluid), it does not explain the more widespread systemic effects seen in the progression of the disease.

In the presence of a susceptible genetic background, both environmental and hormonal factors are thought capable of triggering the infiltration of lymphocytes, specifically CD4+ T cells, B cells, and plasma cells, causing glandular dysfunction in the salivary and lacrimal glands.

Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is associated with increased levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of IL-1RA, an interleukin 1 antagonist. This suggests that the disease begins with increased activity in the interleukin 1 system, followed by an autoregulatory upregulation of IL-1RA to reduce the successful binding of interleukin 1 to its receptors. Interleukin 1 likely is the marker for fatigue, but increased IL-1RA is observed in the CSF and is associated with increased fatigue through cytokine-induced sickness behavior. However, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is characterized by decreased levels of IL-1ra in saliva, which could be responsible for mouth inflammation and dryness. Patients with secondary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome also often exhibit signs and symptoms of their primary rheumatic disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic sclerosis.

=== Genetic predisposition ===
The genetic locus most significantly associated with primary SS is the major histocompatibility complex/human leukocyte antigen (MHC/HLA) region, as demonstrated by the preliminary results of the first genome-wide association study. This study included data from a discovery cohort of 395 patients of European ancestry with primary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, and 1,975 healthy control individuals, and from a replication study that comprised 1,234 cases and 4,779 healthy controls. Associations with polymorphisms located at six independent loci were also detected; &quot;IRF5, STAT4, BLK, IL12A, TNIP1,&quot; and &quot;CXCR5&quot;. This also suggested the activation of the innate immune system, notably through the IFN system, B-cell activation through &quot;CXCR5&quot;-directed recruitment to lymphoid follicles and B-cell receptor (BCR) activation involving&quot; BLK&quot;, and T-cell activation owing to HLA susceptibility and the IL-12-IFN-γ-axis.

Patients of different ethnic origins carry different HLA-susceptibility alleles, of which HLA-DR and HLA-DQ are involved in the pathogenesis of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. For example, patients from Northern and Western Europe and North America show a high prevalence of &quot;B8, DRw52,&quot; and &quot;DR3&quot; genes. HLA class II alleles are associated with the presence of specific subsets of autoantibodies, rather than with the disease itself. Autoantibodies refer to the loss of B-cell tolerance leading to the production of antibodies directed against diverse organ-specific and organ nonspecific antigens. Association between HLA and SS is restricted to patients with anti-SSA/Ro or anti-SSB/La antibodies. Seropositivity for anti-Ro and anti-La is associated with greater severity and longer duration of disease, and findings of their high abundance from the salivary glands of Sjögren&#x27;s patients suggests their imperative role in the pathogenesis of SS.

Beyond genetics, epigenetic abnormality related to DNA methylation, histone acetylation, or microRNA expression probably has a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, though research in this area is very limited.

=== Environmental triggers ===
Environmental factors, such as glandular viral infection, could prompt epithelial cells to activate the HLA-independent innate immune system through toll-like receptors. Although several infectious, exogenous agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-lymphotropic virus 1, and hepatitis C virus, their association with Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome appears weak. While EBV is present in the salivary glands of normal individuals, a high incidence of EBV reactivation in Sjögren&#x27;s patients has been reported with increased levels of EBV DNA. This indicates viral reactivation and the inability of lymphoid infiltrates to control EBV replication in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, leading to the initiation or perpetuation of an immune response in target organs. Nonetheless, exactly how reactivation of EBV is induced in lesions of patients with Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, and which specific molecular mechanisms are involved in the process of viral reactivation, remain to be clarified.

=== Inflammation ===
Epithelial cells in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome lesions are active participants in the induction and perpetuation of the inflammatory process. Environmental and hormonal factors, in concert with an appropriate genetic background, are believed to trigger Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, which dysregulates epithelial cells and allows aberrant homing and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and B cells. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells that process antigen material and present it to other T cells. Following the migration of lymphocytes into the glands in response to chemokines and specific adhesion molecules, T cells interact with epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are further activated by proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF), which are produced by adjacent T cells. The early accumulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the target tissues, which produce high levels of type 1 IFNs, seems important, as these cells can further dysregulate the immune response through abnormal retention of lymphocytes in the tissues, and their subsequent activation. IFN-α stimulates the production of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) by epithelial cells, DCs, and T cells. BAFF stimulates aberrant B-cell maturation, leading to the emergence of self-reactive B cells, which locally produce autoantibodies, in a germinal centre-like structure (GC-like), which is also the location of lymphomagenesis (origin of lymphoma).

=== Programmed cell death ===
Dysregulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death) is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune diseases, though its role in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is controversial. Both the Fas and Fas ligand proteins are overexpressed in primary Sjögren&#x27;s patients, while expression of BCL-1, which is known to downregulate apoptosis, was found significantly reduced in acinar and ductal epithelial cells of Sjögren&#x27;s patients compared to healthy people. &quot;In situ&quot; studies did not show increased apoptosis among glandular epithelial cells but did show reduced apoptosis among infiltrating mononuclear cells. Reduced apoptosis was also implicated in the accumulation of autoreactive B-cells found in the glands. The relationship of autoantibodies expressed in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome with apoptosis is still being researched.

=== Hormonal factors ===
Sex hormones seem to influence humoral and cell-mediated immune response, with estrogen being considered one of the biggest factors responsible for sex-immunologic dimorphism. Estrogen deficiency appears to play a role in the development of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. It has been hypothesized that androgen administration to the ocular surface may serve as an effective therapy for dry eyes.

== Diagnosis ==

While Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is one of the most common auto-immune diseases, it has no specific and non-invasive diagnostic tests.

Diagnosing Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome (SS) is complicated by the range of symptoms that a patient may manifest, and the similarity between symptoms of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome and those of other conditions. Also, patients with SS symptoms approach different specialities for treatment, which can make diagnosis difficult. Since dry eyes and dry mouth are very common symptoms, and frequently occur in people over 40, affected people may believe that the symptoms are age-related, so ignore them. Some medications can cause symptoms similar to those of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome.

===Tests===

The combination of several tests, which can be done in a series, can eventually diagnose Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome.

====Blood tests====

Blood tests can be done to determine if a patient has high levels of antibodies that are indicative of the condition, such as antinuclear antibody (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (because Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome frequently occurs secondary to rheumatoid arthritis), which are associated with autoimmune diseases. Typical SS ANA patterns are SSA/Ro and SSB/La, of which anti-SSB/La is far more specific; anti-SSA/Ro is associated with numerous other autoimmune conditions, but is often present in SS. However anti-SSA and anti-SSB tests are frequently not positive in SS.

====Rose bengal test====
The rose bengal test uses a stain that measures the state and function of the lacrimal glands. This test involves placing the nontoxic dye rose bengal on the eyes. The dye&#x27;s distinctive colour helps in determining the state and functioning of the tear film and the rate of tear evaporation. Any distinctive colour change can indicate SS, but confirming the condition requires many related diagnostic tools.

====Schirmer test====
Schirmer&#x27;s test measures the production of tears: a strip of filter paper is held inside the lower eyelid for five minutes, and its wetness is then measured with a ruler. Producing less than of liquid is usually indicative of SS. This measurement analysis varies among people depending on other eye-related conditions and medications in use when the test is taken. A slit-lamp examination can reveal dryness on the surface of the eye.

Use of Schirmer strips to test oral dryness is possible.

====Saliva flow tests====
Symptoms of dry mouth and dryness in the oral cavity are caused by the reduced production of saliva from the salivary glands (parotid gland, submandibular gland, and sublingual gland).
In unstimulated whole saliva flow collection, the person spits into a test tube every minute for approximately 15 minutes. A resultant collection of less than is considered a positive result.
 In a stimulated saliva flow test the person sucks on a sugar-free sweet, whilst collecting saliva. An unstimulated salivary flow rate of 0.1 to 0.2 ml/min and a stimulated flow rate of 0.7 ml/min or less is considered to be abnormally low flow rates indicative of salivary gland hypofunction.

Unstimulated saliva production reduces by 40 to 70% between the ages of 20 and 80 years, but stimulated saliva production is not affected.

====Lip biopsy====
A lip/salivary gland biopsy takes a tissue sample that can reveal lymphocytes clustered around salivary glands, and damage to these glands from inflammation. This test involves removing a sample of tissue from a person&#x27;s inner lip/salivary gland and examining it under a microscope. On such biopsies, the single most important test result in the diagnosis of the oral component of Sjögren syndrome is likely the &quot;focus score&quot;, which is the number of mononuclear cell infiltrates containing at least 50 inflammatory cells in a 4 mm2 glandular section. The Chisholm-Mason grades are also widely used for salivary gland biopsies (see table).

====Ultrasound====
Salivary gland ultrasonography is not invasive and may help reduce unnecessary biopsies in anti-SSA-negative patients.
====Other tests====
A radiological procedure is available as a reliable and accurate test for Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, in the form of a sialogram. A contrast agent is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the vestibule of the mouth opposite the neck of the upper second molar tooth. The test is intended to detect any blockage in the salivary gland ducts (i.e. parotid duct) and the amount of saliva that flows into the mouth.

For Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, sudomotor function through electrochemical skin conductance may help in the diagnosis process.

===Autoimmune comorbidity===
People with Sjögren&#x27;s may also have other autoimmune conditions.

===Exclusions===
Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome may be excluded in people with past head and neck radiation therapy, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, pre-existing lymphoma, sarcoidosis, graft-versus-host disease, and use of anticholinergic drugs.

== Prevention ==
No prevention mechanism exists for Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome (SS) because of its complexity as an autoimmune disorder. However, lifestyle changes can reduce the risk factors related to developing SS or reducing the severity of the condition for patients who have already been diagnosed.

Diet is strongly associated with the inflammation seen in many autoimmune-related diseases, including SS. An experimental study concluded that SS patients often show high sensitivity to gluten that directly relates to inflammation.

Moderate exercise is also helpful in SS patients, mainly reducing the effect of lung inflammation.

== Treatment ==

===Overview===
Treatment is directed at managing the person&#x27;s symptoms. For dry eyes, artificial tears; medications to reduce inflammation; punctal plugs or other surgery to shut the tear ducts may be tried. For a dry mouth, chewing gum (preferably sugar-free); sipping water; or a saliva substitute may be used. In those with joint or muscle pain, ibuprofen may be used. Medications that can cause dryness, such as antihistamines, may also be stopped. The most specific extant diagnostic test requires lip biopsy.

===Treatments===
Neither a cure nor a specific treatment for Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is known to permanently restore gland secretion. Instead, treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.

==== Eye care ====
Moisture replacement therapies such as artificial tears may ease the symptoms of dry eyes. Some patients with more severe problems use goggles to increase local humidity or have punctal plugs inserted to help retain tears on the ocular surface for a longer time.

Additionally, cyclosporine (Restasis) is available by prescription to treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. Prescription drugs are also available that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as cevimeline (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. Salagen, a manufactured form of pilocarpine, can be used to help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the jaborandi plant.

==== Vaginal dryness ====
In women with Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, vaginal dryness, vulvodynia and dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) are often reported; personal lubricants are recommended to help lessen irritation or pain that may result from dryness in the vaginal and vulval areas.

==== Musculoskeletal ====
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used to treat musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe complications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed, and sometimes intravenous immunoglobulins. Also, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate may be helpful. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than methotrexate. However, these prescribed drugs have a range of side effects such as nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, hair loss, stomach aches/cramps, headache, liver toxicity and increased risk of infections.

==== Systemic ====
For systemic symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, myositis, and neuropathy, biologic immunosuppressant drugs such as rituximab and belimumab that work via B-cell pathology are often used and have less toxic profiles than traditional immunosuppressive regimens.

==== Dental care ====
Preventive dental treatment is also necessary (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with xerostomia creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria that cause cavities. Treatments include at-home topical fluoride application to strengthen tooth enamel and frequent teeth cleanings by a dental hygienist. Existing cavities must also be treated, as cavities that extend into the tooth cannot be effectively treated by teeth cleaning alone, and are at a high risk of spreading into the pulp of the tooth, leading to the loss of vitality and need for extraction or root canal therapy. This treatment regimen is the same as for all xerostomia patients, such as for those undergoing head and neck radiation therapy, which often damages the salivary glands; these glands are more susceptible to radiation than other body tissues.

====Fatigue====
Fatigue, depression, and aerobic capacity all showed a significant difference after a 12-week exercise program compared with controls, in favor of the exercise intervention. A small study showed possible efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation for Sjogren&#x27;s fatigue reduction.

== Prognosis ==
===Organ-related impacts===
====Non-Hodgkin lymphoma====
Results from a number of studies indicate that, compared to other autoimmune diseases, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is associated with a notably high incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of white blood cells. About 5% of patients with SS develop some form of lymphoid malignancy. Patients with severe cases are much more likely to develop lymphomas than patients with mild or moderate cases. The most common lymphomas are salivary extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphomas (MALT lymphomas in the salivary glands) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Lymphomagenesis in primary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome patients is considered a multistep process, with the first step being chronic stimulation of autoimmune B cells, especially B cells that produce rheumatoid factor at sites targeted by the disease. This increases the frequency of oncogenic mutation, leading to any dysfunction at checkpoints of autoimmune B-cell activation to transform into malignancy. A study&#x27;s finding has concluded the continuous stimulation of autoimmune B cells, leads to subtle germinal abnormalities in genes having specific consequences in B cells, which underlies the susceptibility to lymphoma.

====Other organs====
Apart from the notably higher incidence of malignant NHL, Sjögren&#x27;s patients show only modest or clinically insignificant deterioration in specific organ-related function.

===Burden of illness===
Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is associated with a high burden of illness, and has been shown to markedly reduce quality of life (QoL), with a significant impact on ability to work resulting from increased rates of disability. The reduction in QoL is similar to that seen in other chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and fibromyalgia.

===Mortality===
Published studies on the survival of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome patients have been limited in varied respects, perhaps owing to the relatively small sample sizes and the fact that secondary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is associated with other autoimmune diseases.
A 2010 study found a slight increase in mortality rates of Sjögren&#x27;s patients in comparison with the remainder of the population. A 2016 study found that primary Sjögren&#x27;s was not associated with an increase in all-cause mortality as compared with the general population, but that a subset of patients with extraglandular involvement, vasculitis, hypocomplementaemia, and cryoglobulinaemia may be at increased risk of mortality. A 2021 metaanalysis showed a 46% increase in mortality, with significantly greater mortality risk in patients with older age, male gender, vasculitis, interstitial lung disease, low complements, positive anti-La/SSB and cryoglobulinaemia.

Among those without other autoimmune disorders, life expectancy is unchanged.

== Epidemiology ==
Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome (SS) is the third-most common rheumatic autoimmune disorder, behind rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

There are no geographical differences in the rates of SS. Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome has been reported in all areas of the world, although regional rates have not been well studied.

Depending on the criteria for determining prevalence, studies estimate the prevalence of SS at between 500,000 and two million people in the United States. Broader studies of SS prevalence range widely, with some reports of up to a prevalence of 3% of the population. A few studies have reported that the incidence of the syndrome varies between three and six per 100,000 per year.
Between 0.2 and 1.2% of the population is affected, with half having the primary form and half the secondary form. It is around 10 times more common in women than in men. Though the disease commonly begins in middle age, people of any age can be affected.

Nine out of 10 SS patients are women. In addition to prevalence in women, having a first-degree relative with an autoimmune disease and previous pregnancies have been identified as epidemiological risk factors. Despite the lower risk for men, primary SS in men tends to represent a more severe form of the disease. The role of race and ethnicity in the prevalence of the disease is unknown.

Although Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome occurs in all age groups, the average age of onset is between ages 40 and 60, although as many as half of all cases may be left undiagnosed or unreported. The prevalence of SS generally increases with age.

Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is reported in 30-50% of people with rheumatoid arthritis and in 10-25% with systemic lupus erythematosus.

== History ==

The disease was described in 1933 by Henrik Sjögren, after whom it is named, but a number of earlier descriptions of people with the symptoms exist.

Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850–1905) is generally credited with the first description of SS. In 1892, he described a 42-year-old man with enlargement of the parotid and lacrimal glands associated with a round-cell infiltrate and acinar atrophy. However, the criteria that Mikulicz established for diagnosis often led to misdiagnosis of Mikulicz&#x27;s syndrome. Many conditions, such as tuberculosis, infections, sarcoidosis, and lymphoma present with similar conditions to those ascribed to Mikulicz&#x27;s syndrome. Nevertheless, the term &quot;Mikulicz&#x27;s syndrome&quot; is still used occasionally to describe the appearance of lymphocytic infiltrates on salivary-gland biopsies.

In 1930, Henrik Sjögren (1899–1986), an ophthalmologist in Jönköping, Sweden, observed a patient with low secretions from the lacrimal and salivary glands. Sjögren introduced the term keratoconjunctivitis sicca for the symptom of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis). In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis describing 19 females, most of whom were postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. Sjögren clarified that keratoconjunctivitis sicca, resulting from water deficiency, had no relation to xerophthalmia, resulting from vitamin A deficiency. Sjögren&#x27;s thesis was not well received as the Board of Examiners criticized some clinical aspects.

After extensive research and data collection, Sjögren published an essential paper in 1951, describing 80 patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, 50 of whom also had arthritis. His subsequent follow-up conference trips pertaining to his paper led to an international interest in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. The term &quot;keratoconjunctivitis sicca&quot; was coined by Sjögren himself and began to be identified as Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome in literature, although it can now have more general usage.

== Research ==

Research into multifactorial autoimmune diseases such as SS focuses on expanding the knowledge surrounding the disorder, improving diagnostic tools and finding ways to prevent, manage and cure the disorder. The United Kingdom Primary Sjögren&#x27;s Syndrome Registry, a tissue biobank of samples taken for research, supported by the Medical Research Council, UK, was established in 2010. It supports clinical trials and genetic studies of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome and is open to those wishing to participate in research studies and to researchers studying the disease.

As with other autoimmune diseases, susceptibility to Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is greatly influenced by the human leukocyte antigen. DQA1*05:01, DQB1*02:01, and DRB1*03:01 alleles were identified as risk factors, while DQA1*02:01, DQA1*03:01 and DQB1*05:01 alleles were found to be protective factors for the disease. The relationship between alleles and specific race was also established. HLA-DQ2 and HLA-B8 are generally found in Caucasian patients, while HLA-DR5 is related to Greek and Israeli patients. Multiple genome-wide association scans may be conducted in the future to identify key risk variants.

Viruses that have been associated with Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome include human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Some research has shown that a paucity of vitamin A and vitamin D are associated with the disease. Vitamin D deficiency was found to be related to neurological manifestations and the presence of lymphoma among patients, but vitamin A levels were inversely associated with extraglandular manifestations of the disease.

Saliva is a potential diagnostic tool for Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome because the salivary component is changed after the onset of the disease. With the new miniaturization technology, called lab on a chip, the diagnosis can be more convenient.

Concerning therapeutics, multiple monoclonal antibodies were under investigation in 2007. The most promising seemed to be the anti-CD20 rituximab and the anti-CD22 epratuzumab, while the anti-TNF-α and IFN-α seemed less effective.

In 2014, the Sjögren&#x27;s Syndrome Foundation announced a five-year goal to halve the disease&#x27;s average time to diagnosis.

<text>The Battle of Tannenberg, also known as the Second Battle of Tannenberg, was fought between Russia and Germany between 23 and 30 August 1914, the first month of World War I. The battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov. A series of follow-up battles (First Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army.

The battle is particularly notable for fast rail movements by the German Eighth Army, enabling them to concentrate against each of the two Russian armies in turn, first delaying the First Army and then destroying the Second before once again turning on the First days later. It is also notable for the failure of the Russians to encode their radio messages, broadcasting their daily marching orders in the clear, which allowed the Germans to make their movements with the confidence they would not be flanked.

The almost miraculous outcome brought considerable prestige to General (later Field Marshal) Paul von Hindenburg and his rising staff-officer Erich Ludendorff. Although the battle actually took place near Allenstein (Olsztyn), Hindenburg named it after Tannenberg, to the west, in order to avenge the Teutonic Knights&#x27; defeat at the First Battle of Tannenberg 500 years earlier.

==Background==
Germany entered World War I largely following the Schlieffen Plan. According to Prit Buttar, &quot;In combination with his own strong desire to fight an offensive war featuring outflanking and encircling movements, Schlieffen went on to develop his plan for a sweeping advance through Belgium. In the east, limited German forces would defend against any Russian attack until more forces became available from the west, fresh from victory over the French. The total strength of the fully mobilised German Army in 1914 amounted to 1,191 battalions, the great majority of which would be deployed against France. The Eighth Army in East Prussia would go to war with barely 10 per cent of this total.&quot;

The Russian Forces were less prepared than they would have otherwise been thanks to an overestimation of the Russian war machine and a general who was having real problems on Russia&#x27;s other fronts. General Yakov Grigoryevich Zhilinsky was the man in charge of this attack and had pledged to put 800,000 men on the front by the 15th day of mobilization. Of course due to the rushed nature of this attack, the Russian war machine developed numerous cracks and failures as a result of poor communication between the front and command. This lack of communication resulted in orders that would contradict the previous ones and headquarters giving soldiers orders in a hurry. All of this confusion and disorganization severely hampered the General&#x27;s efforts and progress on the Russian Front stalled.

The French army&#x27;s Plan XVII at the outbreak of the war involved swift mobilization followed by an immediate attack to drive the Germans from Alsace and Lorraine. If the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) joined in accordance with their Allied treaty, they would fill the left flank. Their Russian allies in the East would have a massive army, more than 95 divisions, but their mobilization would inevitably be slower. Getting their men to the front would itself take time because of their relatively sparse and unreliable railway network (for example, 75% of Russian railways were still single-tracked). Russia intended to have 27 divisions at the front by day 15 of hostilities and 52 by day 23, but it would take 60 days before 90 divisions were in action. Despite their difficulties, the Russians promised the French that they would promptly engage the armies of Austria-Hungary in the south and on day 15 would invade German East Prussia.

According to Prit Buttar, &quot;In addition to the fortifications amongst the Masurian Lake District, the Germans had built a series of major forts around Königsberg in the 19th century and had then modernised them over the years. Similarly, major fortresses had been established along the Vistula, particularly at Thorn (now Toruń). Combined with the flexibility provided by the German railways, allowing General Maximilian von Prittwitz to concentrate against the inner flanks of either Russian invasion force, the Germans could realistically view the coming war with a degree of confidence.&quot;

The Russians would rely on two of their three railways that ran up to the border; each would provision an army. The railways ended at the border, as Russian trains operated on a different rail gauge from Western Europe. Consequently, its armies could be transported by rail only as far as the German border and could use Prussian railways only with captured locomotives and rolling stock. The First Army would use the line that ran from Vilnius, Lithuania, to the border southeast of Königsberg. The Second Army railway ran from Warsaw, Poland, to the border southwest of Königsberg. The two armies would take the Germans in a pincer. The Russian supply chains would be ungainly because—for defense—on their side of the border there were only a few sandy tracks rather than proper macadamized roads. Adding to their supply problems, the Russians deployed large numbers of cavalry and Cossacks; every day each horse needed ten times the resources that a man required.

The First Army commander was Paul von Rennenkampf, who in the Russo-Japanese War had earned a reputation for &quot;exceptional energy, determination, courage, and military capability.&quot; The First Army was mobilized from the Vilno Military District, and consisted of four infantry corps, five cavalry divisions and an independent cavalry brigade. The Second Army, commanded by Alexander Samsonov, was mobilized from the Warsaw Military District, and consisted of five infantry corps and four cavalry divisions. These two armies formed the Northwestern Front facing the Germans, under the command of Yakov Zhilinsky. The Southwestern Front, facing the Austro-Hungarians in Galicia, was commanded by Nikolai Iudovich Ivanov.

Communications would be a daunting challenge. The Russian supply of cable was insufficient to run telephone or telegraph connections from the rear; all they had was needed for field communications. Therefore, they relied on mobile wireless stations, which would link Zhilinskiy to his two army commanders and with all corps commanders. The Russians were aware that the Germans had broken their ciphers, but they continued to use them until war broke out. A new code was ready but they were still very short of code books. Zhilinskiy and Rennenkampf each had one; Samsonov did not. According to Prit Buttar, &quot;Consequently, Samsonov concluded that he would have to take the risk of using uncoded radio messages.&quot;

==Prelude: 17–22 August==

Rennenkampf&#x27;s First Army crossed the frontier on 17 August, moving westward slowly. This was sooner than the Germans anticipated, because the Russian mobilization, including the Baltic and Warsaw districts, had begun secretly on 25 July, not with the Tsar&#x27;s proclamation on 30 July.

Prittwitz attacked near Gumbinnen on 20 August, when he knew from intercepted wireless messages that Rennenkampf&#x27;s infantry was resting. German I Corps commanded by Gen. Hermann von François was on their left, XVII Corps commanded by Lt. Gen. August von Mackensen in the center and I Reserve Corps led by Gen. Otto von Below on the right. A night march enabled one of François’ divisions to hit the Russian XX Corps&#x27; right flank at 04:00. Rennenkampf&#x27;s men rallied to stoutly resist the attack. Their artillery was devastating until they ran out of ammunition, then the Russians retired. I Corps attacks were halted at 16:00 to rest men sapped by the torrid summer heat. François was sure they could win the next day. On his left, Mackensen&#x27;s XVII Corps launched a vigorous frontal attack but the Russian infantry held firm. That afternoon the Russian heavy artillery struck back—the German infantry fled in panic, their artillery limbered up and joined the stampede. Prittwitz ordered I Corps and I Reserve Corps to break off the action and retreat also.

At noon, Prittwitz had telephoned Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Younger at OHL (Oberste Heeresleitung, Supreme Headquarters) to report that all was going well; that evening he telephoned again to report disaster. His problems were compounded because an intercepted wireless message disclosed that the Russian II Army included five Corps and a cavalry division, and aerial scouts saw their columns marching across the frontier. They were opposed by a single reinforced German Corps, the XX, commanded by Lt. Gen. Friedrich von Scholtz. Their advance offered the possibility of cutting off any retreat westward while possibly encircling them between the two Russian armies. Prittwitz excitedly but inconclusively and repeatedly discussed the horrifying news with Moltke that evening on the telephone, shouting back and forth. At 20:23 Eighth Army telegraphed OHL that they would withdraw to West Prussia.
By the next morning, 21 August, Eighth Army staff realized that because Samsonov&#x27;s II Army was closer to the Vistula crossings than they were, they must first relocate most of their forces to join with XX Corps to block Samsonov before they could withdraw further. Now Moltke was told that they would only retreat a short distance. François protested directly to the Kaiser about his panicking superiors. That evening Prittwitz reported that the German 1st Cavalry Division had disappeared, only to later disclose that they had repulsed the Russian cavalry, capturing several hundred. By this point, Moltke had already decided to replace both Prittwitz and his chief of staff, Alfred von Waldersee. On the morning of 22 August their replacements, Col. Gen. Paul von Hindenburg and Maj. Gen. Erich Ludendorff, were notified of their new assignments.

The Eighth Army issued orders to move to block Samsonov&#x27;s Second Army. I Corps on the German left was closest to the railway, so it would take the long route by train to form up on the right side of XX Corps. The other two German corps would march the shorter distance to XX Corps&#x27; left. The First Cavalry Division and some older garrison troops would remain to screen Rennenkampf. On the afternoon of 22 August, the head of the Eighth Army field railways was informed by telegraph that new commanders were coming by special train. The telegram relieving their former commanders came later. I Corps was moving over more than 150 km (93 miles) of rail, day and night, one train every 30 minutes, with 25 minutes to unload instead of the customary hour or two.

After the battle at Gumbinnen, Rennenkampf decided to pause his First Army to take resupply and to be in good positions if the Germans attacked again. This caused them to lose contact with the German Army, which he incorrectly reported was retreating in haste to the Vistula. Both Russian armies were having serious supply problems; everything had to be carted up from the railheads because they could not use the East Prussian railway track, and many units were hampered by a lack of field bakeries, ammunition carts and the like. The Second Army also was hampered by incompetent staff work and poor communications. Poor staff work not only exacerbated supply problems but, more importantly, caused Samsonov during the fighting to lose operational control over all but the two corps in his immediate vicinity (XIII &amp; XV Corps).

On 21 August, Samsonov&#x27;s Second Army crossed the border, and quickly took several border towns. The VI Corps took Ortelsburg, while I and XV Corps advanced onto Soldau and Neidenburg. On 22 August, Samsonov ordered XV Corps to advance towards Hohenstein, which they did on 23 August pushing Friedrich von Scholtz&#x27;s XX Corps out of Lahna.

==Battle==
=== Consolidation of the German Eighth Army ===
The new commanders arrived at Marienburg on the afternoon of 23 August; they had met for the first time on their special train the previous night and now they rendezvoused with the Eighth Army staff. I Corps was moving by the rail line, and Ludendorff had previously counter-ordered it further east, at Deutsch-Eylau, where it could support the right of XX Corps. XVII Corps and I Reserve Corps would march towards the left of XX Corps. Ludendorff had delayed their marches for a day to rest while remaining in place should Rennenkampf attack. The German 1st Cavalry Division and some garrison troops of older men would remain as a screen just south of the eastern edge of the Königsberg defenses, facing Rennenkampf&#x27;s First Army.

Hindenburg summarized his strategy, &quot;We had not merely to win a victory over Samsonov. We had to annihilate him. Only thus could we get a free hand to deal with the second enemy, Rennenkampf, who was even then plundering and burning East Prussia.&quot; The new commander had raised the stakes dramatically. They must do more than stop Samsonov in his tracks, as they had tried to block and push back Rennenkampf. Samsonov must be annihilated before they turned back to deal with Rennenkampf. For the moment Samsonov would be opposed only by the forces he was already facing, XX Corps, mostly East Prussians who were defending their homes. The bulk of the Second Russian Army was still coming towards the front; if necessary, they would be allowed to push further into the province while the German reinforcements assembled on the flanks, poised to encircle the invaders—just the tactics instilled by Schlieffen.

===Early phases of battle: 23–26 August===
Zhilinskiy had agreed to Samsonov&#x27;s proposal to start the Second Army&#x27;s advance further westward than originally planned, separating them even further from Rennenkampf&#x27;s First Army. On 22 August Samsonov&#x27;s forces encountered Germans all along their front and pushed them back in several places. Zhilinskiy ordered him to pursue vigorously. They already had been advancing for six days in sweltering heat without sufficient rest along primitive roads, averaging a day and had outrun their supplies. On 23 August they attacked the German XX Corps, which retreated to the Orlau-Frankenau line that night. The Russians followed, and on the 24th they attacked again; the now partially entrenched XX Corps temporarily stopped their advance before retreating to avoid possible encirclement. At one stage the chief of staff of the corps directed artillery fire onto his own dwelling.

Samsonov saw a wonderful opportunity because, as far as he was aware, both of his flanks were unopposed. He ordered most of his units to the northwest, toward the Vistula, leaving only his VI Corps to continue north towards their original objective of Seeburg. He did not have enough aircraft or skilled cavalry to detect the German buildup on his left. Rennenkampf mistakenly reported that two of the German Corps had sheltered in the Königsberg fortifications.
On 24 August Hindenburg, Ludendorff and Hoffmann motored along the German lines to meet Scholtz and his principal subordinates, sharing the roads with panic-stricken refugees; in the background were columns of smoke from burning villages ignited by artillery shells. They could keep control of their army because most of the local telephone operators remained at their switchboards, carefully tracking the motorcade. Along the way they drove through the village of Tannenberg, which reminded the two younger men of the defeat of the Teutonic Knights there by the Poles and Lithuanians in 1410; Hindenburg had been thinking about that battle since the evening before when he strolled near the ruins of the castle of the Teutonic Order. (In 1910 Slavs had commemorated their triumph on the old battlefield.)

Aided by Russian radio intercepts, a captured map of Russian positions, and information from fleeing German civilians of Rennenkampf&#x27;s slow progress, Hindenburg and Ludendorff planned the encirclement of the Russian Second Army. I Corps and XX Corps would attack from Gilgenburg towards Neidenburg, while XVII Corps and I Reserve Corps attacked the Russian right flank. They met with Scholtz and his XX Corps staff on 24 August, and François on 25 August, where he was ordered to attack towards Usdau on 26 August. François stated only part of his corps and artillery had arrived. Ludendorf insisted the attack must go forward as planned, since more trains were expected beforehand. François replied, &quot;If it is so ordered, of course an attack will be made, and the troops will obviously have to fight with bayonets.&quot;

On the way back to headquarters Hoffmann received new radio intercepts. Rennenkampf&#x27;s most recent orders from Zhilinskiy were to continue due west, not turn south-westward towards Samsonov, who was instructed to continue his own drive northwest further away from Rennenkampf. Based on this information Scholtz formed a new defensive flank along the Drewenz River, while his main line strengthened their defenses. Back at headquarters Hindenburg told the staff, &quot;Gentlemen. Our preparations are so well in hand that we can sleep soundly tonight.&quot;

Samsonov was concerned by the German resistance with their earlier advance, and aerial reconnaissance spotted the arrival of the German I Corps. However, Samsonov was ordered by Zhilinski to attack northwest with Martos&#x27; XV Corps, and Klyuev&#x27;s XII Corps, while I Corps protected the left flank, and VI Corps was positioned on the right at Bischofsburg.

===Main battle: 27–30 August ===

Zhilinskiy was visited by the commander of the Russian Army, the Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia, who ordered him to support Samsonov.
Von François commenced his attack early on the 25th, with his 1st Infantry Division advancing towards Seeben, his 2nd Infantry division on its southern flank, and the rest of his corps arriving by train during the day. He captured Seeben by mid-afternoon, but saved an advance on Usdau for the next day. North of von François, Scholtz&#x27;s 37th and 41st Infantry Divisions faced the Russian 2nd Infantry Division, which fell back with heavy losses. On the left flank of Scholtz&#x27;s XX Corps, Curt von Morgen&#x27;s 3rd Reserve Division was ordered to advance onto Hohenstein, but held back out of concern that the Russian XV and XII Corps would threaten his left flank. Klyuev&#x27;s Russian XIII Corps was ordered to advance onto Allenstein. On Samsonov&#x27;s right flank, Alexander Blagoveschensky&#x27;s Russian VI corps soon faced Mackensen&#x27;s German XVII Corps and von Below&#x27;s German I Reserve Corps. Von Below, to the right of Mackensen, advanced to cut the road between Bischofsburg and Wartenburg. Blagoveschensky&#x27;s 16th Infantry Division occupied Bischofsburg, while his 4th Infantry Division was north of Rothfliess, and his 4th Cavalry division was at Sensburg. The 16th Infantry division was ordered to move towards Allenstein, while the 16th Infantry Division was split between Lautern and Gross-Bössau. Mackensen&#x27;s 36th Infantry Division, on the right, and his 35th infantry Division, on the left, advanced towards Bischofsburg. The Russian 4th Infantry Division suffered heavy losses and retreated towards Ortelsburg. In an attempt to send reinforcements, Blagoveschensky split the 16th Infantry Division between Bischofsburg and Ramsau. However, they were met in the flank and rear by von Belows&#x27;s I Reserve Corps, and retreated in disarray.


That evening the Eighth Army&#x27;s staff was on edge. Little had been achieved during the day, when they had intended to spring the trap. XX Corps had done well on another torrid day, but now was exhausted. On their far left they knew that XVII Corps and I Reserve Corps were coming into action, but headquarters had learned little about their progress. In fact, XVII Corps had defeated the Russian VI Corps, which fled back along the roads. XVII Corps had endured long marches in sweltering weather, but some men still had the energy to pursue on bicycles requisitioned from civilians. Hoffmann, who had been an observer with the Japanese in Manchuria, tried to ease their nerves by telling how Samsonov and Rennenkampf had quarreled during that war, so they would do nothing to help one another. It was a good story that Hoffmann treasured and retold frequently. In Hindenburg&#x27;s words &quot;It was now apparent that danger was threatening from the side of Rennenkampf. It was reported that one of his corps was on the march through Angerburg. It is surprising that misgivings filled many a heart, that firm resolution began to yield to vacillation, and that doubts crept in where a clear vision had hitherto prevailed? We overcame the inward crisis, adhered to our original intention, and turned in full strength to effect its realization by attack.&quot; The German right flank would advance to Neidenburg, while von Below&#x27;s I Reserve Corps advanced to Allenstein, and Mackensen&#x27;s XVII Corps chased Blagoveschensky&#x27;s retreating VI Corps.

Von François was ready to attack the Russian left decisively on 27 August, hitting I Russian Corps. His artillery barrage was overwhelming, and soon he had taken the key town of Usdau. In the center the Russians continued to strongly attack the German XX Corps and to move northwest from Allenstein. The German XVII Corps and I Reserve Corps pushed the Russian right wing they had bloodied the day before further back. Gen. Basil Gourko, commanding the Russian First Army Cavalry Division (and from 1916 to 1917 chief of the general staff), was told later that Samsonov was not aware of what was happening on his flanks because he was observing the action from a rise in the ground a distance from his wireless set and reports were not relayed to him.

On the morning of 28 August the German commanders were motoring along the front when they were shown a report from an aerial observer that Rennenkampf&#x27;s army was moving towards their rear. Ludendorff announced that the attack on the Second Army must be broken off. Hindenburg led him behind a nearby hedge; when they emerged Hindenburg calmly said that operations would continue as planned. Later radio intercepts confirmed Rennenkampf was still slowly advancing on Königsberg. Von François&#x27; I Corps resumed his assault on the Russian I Corps, taking Soldau by late morning, and then advancing onto Neidenburg, as the Russian I Corps became an ineffective force in the battle. Scholtz&#x27;s XX Corps, to the north, also advanced. Though his 41st Infantry Division was badly mauled by Martos&#x27; Russian XV Corps, it held its ground, while the German 37th Infantry Division reached Hohenstein by the end of the day. The German 3rd Reserve Division was also able to advance on the Russian XV Corps, forcing Samsonov to order a retreat to Neidenburg. Von Below&#x27;s German I Reserve Corps engaged Klyuev&#x27;s Russian XIII Corps west of Allenstein, and became isolated. Klyuev received orders from Samsonov to retreat towards Kurken. Mackensen&#x27;s German XVII Corps continued pursuing the retreating Russians. One half of the German encirclement was complete by the end of the day, as Ludendorff wrote, &quot;The enemy front seemed to be breaking up... We did not have a clear picture of the situation with individual units. But there was no doubt that the battle was won.&quot;

On 29 August, von François&#x27; cavalry regiment reached Willenberg by evening, while his 1st Infantry Division occupied the road between Neidenburg and Willenberg. Von François&#x27; I Corps patrols linked up with Mackensen&#x27;s German XVII Corps, who had advanced to Jedwabno, completing the encirclement. On 29 August the troops from the Russian Second Army&#x27;s center who were retreating south ran into a German defensive line. Those Russians who tried to break through by dashing across open fields heavy with crops were mowed down. They were in a cauldron centered at Frogenau, west of Tannenberg, and throughout the day they were relentlessly pounded by artillery. Many surrendered – long columns of prisoners jammed the roads away from the battleground. Hindenburg and Ludendorff watched from a hilltop, with only a single field telephone line; thereafter they stayed closer to the telephone network. Hindenburg met one captured Russian corps commander that day, another on the day following. On 30 August the Russians remaining outside of the cauldron tried unsuccessfully to break open the snare. Rather than report the loss of his army to Tsar Nicholas II, Samsonov disappeared into the woods that night and committed suicide. His body was found in the following year and returned to Russia by the Red Cross.

On 31 August Hindenburg formally reported to the Kaiser that three Russian army corps (XIII, XV and XXIII) had been destroyed. The two corps (I and VI) that had not been caught in the cauldron had been severely bloodied and were retreating back to Poland. He requested that the battle be named Tannenberg (an imaginative touch that both Ludendorff and Hoffmann claimed as their own).
Samsonov&#x27;s Second Army had been almost annihilated: 78,000 killed or wounded, 92,000 captured (includes the wounded) and only 10,000 (mostly from the retreating flanks) escaping. The Russians had lost 350 big guns. The Germans suffered just 12,000 casualties out of the 150,000 men committed to the battle. Sixty trains were required to take captured Russian equipment to Germany. The German official history estimated 50,000 Russians killed and wounded, which were never properly recorded. Another estimate gives 30,000 Russians killed or wounded, with 13 generals and 500 guns captured.

==Aftermath==
To David Stevenson it was &quot;a major victory but far from decisive&quot;, because the Russian First Army was still in East Prussia. It set the stage for the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes a week later, when the reinforced German Eighth Army confronted the Russian First Army. Rennenkampf retreated hastily back over the pre-war border before they could be encircled. The battle was humiliating to Russia as it meant their army was weak.

British Field Marshal Sir Edmund Ironside saw Tannenberg as the &quot;… greatest defeat suffered by any of the combatants during the war&quot;. It was a tactical masterpiece that demonstrated the superior skills of the German army. Their pre-war organization and training had proven themselves, which bolstered German morale while severely shaking Russian confidence. Nonetheless, as long as the great battle in the West continued the outnumbered Germans had to remain on the defensive in the East, anticipating that the Russians would make another thrust from Poland against Germany, and because the Russians had defeated the Austro-Hungarians in the Battle of Galicia; their allies would need help.

The Russian official inquiry into the disaster blamed Zhilinskiy for not controlling his two armies. He was replaced in the Northwest Command and sent to liaise with the French. Rennenkampf was exonerated, but was retired after a dubious performance in Poland in 1916.

Hindenburg was hailed as an epic hero, Ludendorff was praised, but Hoffmann was generally ignored by the press. Apparently not pleased by this, he later gave tours of the area, noting, &quot;This is where the Field Marshal slept before the battle, this is where he slept after the battle, and this is where he slept during the battle.&quot; However, Hindenburg countered by saying, &quot;If the battle had gone badly, the name &#x27;Hindenburg&#x27; would have been reviled from one end of Germany to the other.&quot; Hoffmann is not mentioned in Hindenburg&#x27;s memoirs. In his memoirs Ludendorff takes credit for the encirclement and most historians give him full responsibility for conducting the battle. Hindenburg wrote and spoke of &quot;we&quot;, and when questioned about the crucial tête-à-tête with Ludendorff after dinner on 26 August resolutely maintained that they had calmly discussed their options and resolved to continue with the encirclement. Military historian Walter Elze wrote that a few months before his death Hindenburg finally acknowledged that Ludendorff had been in a state of panic that evening. Hindenburg would also remark, &quot;After all, I know something about the business, I was the instructor in tactics at the War Academy for six years&quot;.

== Casualties ==
Russian casualties as a result of the battle are often discussed among historians; in his memoirs, Hindenburg named the number of Russian prisoners at 92,000 people. This is also confirmed by the Reichsarchiv. As well as up to 50,000 KIA. However, these figures are false, since only half of Samsonov&#x27;s total army was encircled. Some of the troops were also able to break out of the encirclement; as such, the losses cannot be more than 80,000 people according to a Russian source.

==Post-war legacy==
A German monument commemorating the battle was completed in 1927 in Hohenstein. However, it was blown up in World War II by the Germans during their retreat from Prussia in January 1945.

German film director Heinz Paul made a film, &quot;Tannenberg&quot;, about the battle, shot in East Prussia in 1932.

The battle is at the center of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s novel &quot;August 1914&quot;, published in 1971, and is featured in the video games &quot;Darkest of Days&quot; and &quot;Tannenberg&quot;.

<text>Roy Fox Lichtenstein (; October 27, 1923 – September 29, 1997) was an American pop artist. He rose to prominence in the 1960s through pieces which were inspired by popular advertising and the comic book style. Much of his work explores the relationship between fine art, advertising, and consumerism.

&quot;Whaam!&quot;, &quot;Drowning Girl&quot;, and &quot;Look Mickey&quot; proved to be Lichtenstein&#x27;s most influential works. His most expensive piece is &quot;Masterpiece&quot;, which was sold for $165 million in 2017.

Lichtenstein&#x27;s paintings were exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City, which represented him from 1961 onwards. His artwork was considered to be &quot;disruptive&quot;. Lichtenstein described pop art as &quot;not &#x27;American&#x27; painting but actually industrial painting&quot;.

== Early years ==
Lichtenstein was born on October 27, 1923, into an upper middle class German-Jewish family in New York City. His father, Milton, was a real estate broker, and his mother, Beatrice (née Werner), a homemaker. Lichtenstein was raised on New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side and attended public school until he was 12. Lichtenstein then attended New York&#x27;s Dwight School, graduating in 1940. He first became interested in art and design as a hobby, through school. Lichtenstein was an avid jazz fan, often attending concerts at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. He frequently drew portraits of the musicians playing their instruments. In 1939, his last year of high school, Lichtenstein enrolled in summer classes at the Art Students League of New York, where he worked under the tutelage of Reginald Marsh.

== Career ==

Lichtenstein then left New York to study at Ohio State University, which offered studio courses and a degree in fine arts. His studies were interrupted by a three-year stint in the Army during and after World War II between 1943 and 1946. After being in training programs for languages, engineering in the Army Specialized Training Program, and pilot training, all of which were cancelled, Lichtenstein served as an orderly, draftsman, and artist.

Lichtenstein returned home to visit his dying father and was discharged from the Army with eligibility for the G.I. Bill. Lichtenstein returned to studies in Ohio under the supervision of one of his teachers, Hoyt L. Sherman, who is widely regarded to have had a significant impact on his future work (Lichtenstein would later name a new studio he funded at OSU as the Hoyt L. Sherman Studio Art Center).

Lichtenstein entered the graduate program at Ohio State and was hired as an art instructor, a post he held on and off for the next ten years. In 1949, Lichtenstein earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from Ohio State University.

In 1951, Lichtenstein had his first solo exhibition at the Carlebach Gallery in New York.
He moved to Cleveland that same year, where he remained for six years, although Lichtenstein frequently traveled back to New York. During this time, he undertook jobs as varied as a draftsman to a window decorator in between periods of painting. Lichtenstein&#x27;s work at this time fluctuated between Cubism and Expressionism. In 1954, his first son, David Hoyt Lichtenstein, now a songwriter, was born. His second son, Mitchell Lichtenstein, was born two years later.

In 1957, Lichtenstein moved back to upstate New York and began teaching again. It was at this time that he adopted the Abstract Expressionism style, being a late convert to this style of painting. Lichtenstein began teaching in upstate New York at the State University of New York at Oswego in 1958. Around this time, he began to incorporate hidden images of cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny into his abstract works.

=== Rise to prominence ===
In 1960, Lichtenstein started teaching at Rutgers University where he was heavily influenced by Allan Kaprow, who was also a teacher at the university. This environment helped reignite Lichtenstein&#x27;s interest in Proto-pop imagery.
In 1961, he began his first pop paintings using cartoon images and techniques derived from the appearance of commercial printing. This phase would continue to 1965, and included the use of advertising imagery suggesting consumerism and homemaking.
Lichtenstein&#x27;s first work to feature the large-scale use of hard-edged figures and Ben-Day dots was &quot;Look Mickey&quot; (1961, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). This piece came from a challenge from one of his sons, who pointed to a Mickey Mouse comic book and said; &quot;I bet you can&#x27;t paint as good as that, eh, Dad?&quot; That same year, Lichtenstein produced six other works with recognizable characters from gum wrappers and cartoons.

In 1961, Leo Castelli started displaying Lichtenstein&#x27;s work at his gallery in New York. Lichtenstein had his first one-man show at the Castelli gallery in 1962; the entire collection was bought by influential collectors before the show even opened. A group of paintings produced between 1961 and 1962 focused on solitary household objects such as sneakers, hot dogs, and golf balls. In September 1963, Lichtenstein took a leave of absence from his teaching position at Douglass College at Rutgers.

Lichtenstein&#x27;s works were inspired by comics featuring war and romantic stories. &quot;At that time,&quot; he later recounted, &quot;I was interested in anything I could use as a subject that was emotionally strong – usually love, war, or something that was highly charged and emotional subject matter to be opposite to the removed and deliberate painting techniques&quot;.

=== Period of Lichtenstein&#x27;s highest profile ===

It was at this time that Lichtenstein began to find fame not just in America but worldwide. He moved back to New York to be at the center of the art scene and resigned from Rutgers University in 1964 to concentrate on his painting. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna (early acrylic) paint in his best known works, such as &quot;Drowning Girl&quot; (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Secret Hearts&quot; No. 83, drawn by Tony Abruzzo. (&quot;Drowning Girl&quot; now hangs in the Museum of Modern Art, New York.) &quot;Drowning Girl&quot; also features thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots, as if created by photographic reproduction. Of his own work, Lichtenstein would say that the Abstract Expressionists &quot;put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don&#x27;t come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock&#x27;s or Kline&#x27;s.&quot;

Rather than attempt to reproduce his subjects, Lichtenstein&#x27;s work tackled the way in which the mass media portrays them. However, he would never take himself too seriously, saying: &quot;I think my work is different from comic strips – but I wouldn&#x27;t call it transformation; I don&#x27;t think that whatever is meant by it is important to art&quot;. When Lichtenstein&#x27;s work was first exhibited, many art critics of the time challenged its originality. His work was harshly criticized as vulgar and empty. The title of a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article in 1964 asked, &quot;Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?&quot; Lichtenstein responded to such claims by offering responses such as the following: &quot;The closer my work is to the original, the more threatening and critical the content. However, my work is entirely transformed in that my purpose and perception are entirely different. I think my paintings are critically transformed, but it would be difficult to prove it by any rational line of argument.&quot; He discussed experiencing this heavy criticism in an interview with April Bernard and Mimi Thompson in 1986. Suggesting that it was at times difficult to be criticized, Lichtenstein said, &quot;I don&#x27;t doubt when I&#x27;m actually painting, it&#x27;s the criticism that makes you wonder, it does.&quot;

Lichtenstein&#x27;s celebrated image &quot;Whaam!&quot; (1963) depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the onomatopoeic lettering &quot;Whaam!&quot; and the boxed caption &quot;I pressed the fire control ... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky ...&quot; This diptych is large in scale, measuring 1.7 x 4.0 m (5 ft 7 in x 13 ft 4 in). &quot;Whaam&quot; follows the comic strip-based themes of some of his previous paintings and is part of a body of war-themed work created between 1962 and 1964. It is one of his two notable large war-themed paintings. It was purchased by the Tate Gallery in 1966, after being exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1963, and (now at the Tate Modern) has remained in their collection ever since. In 1968, the Darmstadt entrepreneur Karl Ströher acquired several major works by Lichtenstein, such as &quot;Nurse&quot; (1964), &quot;Compositions I&quot; (1964), &quot;We rose up slowly&quot; (1964) and &quot;Yellow and Green Brushstrokes&quot; (1966). After being on loan at the Hessiches Landesmuseum Darmstadt for several years, the founding director of the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Peter Iden, was able to acquire a total of 87 works from the Ströher collection in 1981, primarily American Pop Art and Minimal Art for the museum under construction until 1991.

Lichtenstein began experimenting with sculpture around 1964, demonstrating a knack for the form that was at odds with the insistent flatness of his paintings. For &quot;Head of Girl&quot; (1964), and &quot;Head with Red Shadow&quot; (1965), Lichtenstein collaborated with a ceramicist who sculpted the form of the head out of clay. He then applied a glaze to create the same sort of graphic motifs that he used in his paintings; the application of black lines and Ben-Day dots to three-dimensional objects resulted in a flattening of the form.

Most of Lichtenstein&#x27;s best-known works are relatively close, but not exact, copies of comic book panels, a subject he largely abandoned in 1965, though he would occasionally incorporate comics into his work in different ways in later decades. These panels were originally drawn by such comics artists as Jack Kirby and DC Comics artists Russ Heath, Tony Abruzzo, Irv Novick, and Jerry Grandenetti, who rarely received any credit. Jack Cowart, executive director of the Lichtenstein Foundation, contests the notion that Lichtenstein was a copyist, saying: &quot;Roy&#x27;s work was a wonderment of the graphic formulae and the codification of sentiment that had been worked out by others. The panels were changed in scale, color, treatment, and in their implications. There is no exact copy.&quot; However, some have been critical of Lichtenstein&#x27;s use of comic-book imagery and art pieces, especially insofar as that use has been seen as endorsement of a patronizing view of comics by the art mainstream; cartoonist Art Spiegelman commented that &quot;Lichtenstein did no more or less for comics than Andy Warhol did for soup.&quot;

Lichtenstein&#x27;s works based on enlarged panels from comic books engendered a widespread debate about their merits as art. Lichtenstein himself admitted, &quot;I am nominally copying, but I am really restating the copied thing in other terms. In doing that, the original acquires a totally different texture. It isn&#x27;t thick or thin brushstrokes, it&#x27;s dots and flat colours and unyielding lines.&quot; Eddie Campbell blogged that &quot;Lichtenstein took a tiny picture, smaller than the palm of the hand, printed in four color inks on newsprint and blew it up to the conventional size at which &#x27;art&#x27; is made and exhibited and finished it in paint on canvas.&quot; With regard to Lichtenstein, Bill Griffith once said, &quot;There&#x27;s high art and there&#x27;s low art. And then there&#x27;s high art that can take low art, bring it into a high art context, appropriate it and elevate it into something else.&quot; Lichtenstein held a deeply knowledgeable history of art and would often references and pay homage to artists throughout his career including Dali, Monet and Picasso notably in works including the Figures, Water Lilies and Bull portfolios. 

Although Lichtenstein&#x27;s comic-based work gained some acceptance, concerns are still expressed by critics who say Lichtenstein did not credit, pay any royalties to, or seek permission from the original artists or copyright holders. In an interview for a BBC Four documentary in 2013, Alastair Sooke asked the comic book artist Dave Gibbons if he considered Lichtenstein a plagiarist. Gibbons replied: &quot;I would say &#x27;copycat&#x27;. In music for instance, you can&#x27;t just whistle somebody else&#x27;s tune or perform somebody else&#x27;s tune, no matter how badly, without somehow crediting and giving payment to the original artist. That&#x27;s to say, this is &#x27;WHAAM! by Roy Lichtenstein, after Irv Novick&#x27;.&quot; Sooke himself maintains that &quot;Lichtenstein transformed Novick&#x27;s artwork in a number of subtle but crucial ways.&quot;

City University London lecturer Ernesto Priego notes that Lichtenstein&#x27;s failure to credit the original creators of his comic works was a reflection on the decision by National Periodical Publications, the predecessor of DC Comics, to omit any credit for their writers and artists:

Furthermore, Campbell notes that there was a time when comic artists often declined attribution for their work.

In an account published in 1998, Novick said that he had met Lichtenstein in the army in 1947 and, as his superior officer, had responded to Lichtenstein&#x27;s tearful complaints about the menial tasks he was assigned by recommending him for a better job. Jean-Paul Gabilliet has questioned this account, saying that Lichtenstein had left the army a year before the time Novick says the incident took place. Bart Beaty, noting that Lichtenstein had appropriated Novick for works such as &quot;Whaam!&quot; and &quot;Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!&quot;, says that Novick&#x27;s story &quot;seems to be an attempt to personally diminish&quot; the more famous artist.

In 1966, Lichtenstein moved on from his much-celebrated imagery of the early 1960s, and began his &quot;Modern Paintings&quot; series, including over 60 paintings and accompanying drawings. Using his characteristic Ben-Day dots and geometric shapes and lines, he rendered incongruous, challenging images out of familiar architectural structures, patterns borrowed from Art Déco and other subtly evocative, often sequential, motifs. The &quot;Modern Sculpture&quot; series of 1967–8 made reference to motifs from Art Déco architecture.

=== Later work ===

In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein reproduced masterpieces by Cézanne, Mondrian and Picasso before embarking on the &quot;Brushstrokes&quot; series in 1965. He continued to revisit this theme later in his career with works such as &quot;Bedroom at Arles&quot; that derived from Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Bedroom in Arles&quot;.

In 1970, Lichtenstein was commissioned by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (within its Art and Technology program developed between 1967 and 1971) to make a film. With the help of Universal Film Studios, the artist conceived of, and produced, &quot;Three Landscapes&quot;, a film of marine landscapes, directly related to a series of collages with landscape themes he created between 1964 and 1966. Although Lichtenstein had planned to produce 15 short films, the three-screen installation – made with New York-based independent filmmaker Joel Freedman – turned out to be the artist&#x27;s only venture into the medium.

Also in 1970, Lichtenstein purchased a former carriage house in Southampton, Long Island, built a studio on the property, and spent the rest of the 1970s in relative seclusion. In the 1970s and 1980s, his style began to loosen and he expanded on what he had done before. Lichtenstein began a series of &quot;Mirrors&quot; paintings in 1969. By 1970, while continuing on the &quot;Mirrors&quot; series, he started work on the subject of entablatures. The &quot;Entablatures&quot; consisted of a first series of paintings from 1971 to 1972, followed by a second series in 1974–76, and the publication of a series of relief prints in 1976. Lichtenstein produced a series of &quot;Artists Studios&quot; which incorporated elements of his previous work. A notable example being &quot;Artist&#x27;s Studio, Look Mickey&quot; (1973, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis) which incorporates five other previous works, fitted into the scene.

During a trip to Los Angeles in 1978, Lichtenstein was fascinated by lawyer Robert Rifkind&#x27;s collection of German Expressionist prints and illustrated books. He began to produce works that borrowed stylistic elements found in Expressionist paintings. &quot;The White Tree&quot; (1980) evokes lyric Der Blaue Reiter landscapes, while &quot;Dr. Waldmann&quot; (1980) recalls Otto Dix&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Mayer-Hermann&quot; (1926). Small colored-pencil drawings were used as templates for woodcuts, a medium favored by Emil Nolde and Max Pechstein, as well as Dix and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Also in the late 1970s, Lichtenstein&#x27;s style was replaced with more surreal works such as &quot;Pow Wow&quot; (1979, Ludwig Forum für Internationale Kunst, Aachen). A major series of Surrealist-Pop paintings from 1979 to 1981 is based on Native American themes. These works range from &quot;Amerind Figure&quot; (1981), a stylized life-size sculpture reminiscent of a streamlined totem pole in black-patinated bronze, to the monumental wool tapestry &quot;Amerind Landscape&quot; (1979). The &quot;Indian&quot; works took their themes, like the other parts of the Surrealist series, from contemporary art and other sources, including books on American Indian design from Lichtenstein&#x27;s small library.

Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;Still Life&quot; paintings, sculptures and drawings, which span from 1972 through the early 1980s, cover a variety of motifs and themes, including the most traditional such as fruit, flowers, and vases. In 1983 Lichtenstein made two anti-apartheid posters, simply titled &quot;Against Apartheid&quot;. In his &quot;Reflection&quot; series, produced between 1988 and 1990, Lichtenstein reused his own motifs from previous works. &quot;Interiors&quot; (1991–1992) is a series of works depicting banal domestic environments inspired by furniture ads the artist found in telephone books or on billboards. Having garnered inspiration from the monochromatic prints of Edgar Degas featured in a 1994 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the motifs of his &quot;Landscapes in the Chinese Style&quot; series are formed with simulated Ben-Day dots and block contours, rendered in hard, vivid color, with all traces of the hand removed. The nude is a recurring element in Lichtenstein&#x27;s work of the 1990s, such as in &quot;Collage for Nude with Red Shirt&quot; (1995).

In addition to paintings and sculptures, Lichtenstein also made over 300 prints, mostly in screenprinting.

=== Commissions ===
In 1969, Lichtenstein was commissioned by Gunter Sachs to create &quot;Composition&quot; and &quot;Leda and the Swan&quot;, for the collector&#x27;s Pop Art bedroom suite at the Palace Hotel in St. Moritz. In the late 1970s and during the 1980s, Lichtenstein received major commissions for works in public places: the sculptures &quot;Lamp&quot; (1978) in St. Mary&#x27;s, Georgia; &quot;Mermaid&quot; (1979) in Miami Beach; the 26 feet tall &quot;Brushstrokes in Flight&quot; (1984, moved in 1998) at John Glenn Columbus International Airport; the five-storey high &quot;Mural with Blue Brushstroke&quot; (1984–85) at the Equitable Center, New York; and &quot;El Cap de Barcelona&quot; (1992) in Barcelona. In 1994, Lichtenstein created the 53-foot-long, enamel-on-metal &quot;Times Square Mural&quot; in Times Square subway station. In 1977, he was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group 5 Racing Version of the BMW 320i for the third installment in the BMW Art Car Project. The DreamWorks Records logo was his last completed project. &quot;I&#x27;m not in the business of doing anything like that (a corporate logo) and don&#x27;t intend to do it again,&quot; allows Lichtenstein. &quot;But I know Mo Ostin and David Geffen and it seemed interesting.&quot;

He also served on the board of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

In 2023, five of Lichtenstein&#x27;s paintings will be featured on USPS Forever stamps: &quot;Standing Explosion (Red)&quot;, &quot;Modern Painting I&quot;, &quot;Still Life with Crystal Bowl&quot;, &quot;Still Life with Goldfish&quot;, and &quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot;. Derry Noyes served as the stamp series&#x27; art director and designer.

== Personal life ==
In 1949, Lichtenstein married Isabel Wilson, who previously had been married to Ohio artist Michael Sarisky. However, the brutal upstate winters took a toll on Lichtenstein and his wife, after he began teaching at the State University of New York at Oswego in 1958. The couple sold the family home in Highland Park, New Jersey, in 1963 and divorced in 1965.

Lichtenstein married his second wife, Dorothy Herzka, (1939–2024), in 1968. In the late 1960s, they rented a house in Southampton, New York that Larry Rivers had bought around the corner from his own house. Three years later, they bought a 1910 carriage house facing the ocean on Gin Lane. From 1970 until his death, Lichtenstein split his time between Manhattan and Southampton. He also had a home on Captiva Island.

In 1991, Lichtenstein began an affair with singer Erica Wexler who became the muse for his Nudes series including the 1994 &quot;Nudes with Beach Ball&quot;. She was 22 and he was 68. The affair lasted until 1994 and was over when Wexler went to England with future husband Andy Partridge of XTC. According to Wexler, Lichtenstein and his wife Dorothy had an understanding and they both had significant others in addition to their marriage.

On September 29, 1997, Lichtenstein died of pneumonia at New York University Medical Center, where he had been hospitalized for several weeks, at age 73. Lichtenstein was survived by his second wife, Dorothy Herzka, and by his sons, David and Mitchell, from his first marriage.

== Relevance ==
Pop art continues to influence the 21st century. &quot;Pop Art from the Collection&quot; features a wide range selection of screenprints by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, as well as an assortment of Warhol&#x27;s Polaroid photographs known as the leading figures of the Pop Art movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Warhol and Lichtenstein are celebrated for exploring the relationship between fine art, advertising, and consumerism. Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol were both used in U2&#x27;s 1997, 1998 PopMart Tour and in an exhibition in 2007 at the British National Portrait Gallery.

Among many other works of art lost in the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001, a painting from Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;The Entablature Series&quot; was destroyed in the subsequent fire.

== Exhibitions ==
In 1964, Lichtenstein became the first American to exhibit at the Tate Gallery, London, on the occasion of the show &quot;&#x27;54–&#x27;64: Painting and Sculpture of a Decade.&quot; In 1967, his first museum retrospective exhibition was held at the Pasadena Art Museum in California. The same year, his first solo exhibition in Europe was held at museums in Amsterdam, London, Bern and Hannover. Lichtenstein later participated in documentas IV (1968) and VI in (1977). Lichtenstein had his first retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in 1969, organized by Diane Waldman. The Guggenheim presented a second Lichtenstein retrospective in 1994. Lichtenstein became the first living artist to have a solo drawing exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art from March – June 1987. Recent retrospective surveys include the 2003 &quot;All About Art&quot;, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, in Denmark (which traveled on to the Hayward Gallery, London, Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, until 2005); and &quot;Classic of the New&quot;, Kunsthaus Bregenz (2005), &quot;Roy Lichtenstein: Meditations on Art&quot; Museo Triennale, Milan (2010, traveled to the Museum Ludwig, Cologne). In late 2010 The Morgan Library &amp; Museum showed &quot;Roy Lichtenstein: The Black-and-White Drawings, 1961–1968&quot;. Another major retrospective opened at the Art Institute of Chicago in May 2012 before going to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Tate Modern in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2013. 2013:Roy Lichtenstein, Olyvia Fine Art. 2014: Roy Lichtenstein: Intimate Sculptures, The FLAG Art Foundation. Roy Lichtenstein: Opera Prima, Civic Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Arts, Turin. 2018: Exhibition at The Tate Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom.

== Collections ==
In 1996 the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. became the largest single repository of the artist&#x27;s work when Lichtenstein donated 154 prints and two books. The Art Institute of Chicago has several important works by Lichtenstein in its permanent collection, including &quot;Brushstroke with Spatter&quot; (1966) and &quot;Mirror No. 3 (Six Panels)&quot; (1971). The personal holdings of Lichtenstein&#x27;s widow, Dorothy Lichtenstein, and of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation number in the hundreds. In Europe, the Museum Ludwig in Cologne has one of the most comprehensive Lichtenstein holdings with &quot;Takka Takka&quot; (1962), &quot;Nurse&quot; (1964), &quot;Compositions I&quot; (1964), besides the Frankfurt Museum für Moderne Kunst with &quot;We rose up slowly&quot; (1964) and &quot;Yellow and Green Brushstrokes&quot; (1966). Outside the United States and Europe, the National Gallery of Australia&#x27;s Kenneth Tyler Collection has extensive holdings of Lichtenstein&#x27;s prints, numbering over 300 works. In total there are some 4,500 works thought to be in circulation.

== Roy Lichtenstein Foundation ==
After the artist&#x27;s death in 1997, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation was established in 1999. In 2011, the foundation&#x27;s board decided the benefits of authenticating were outweighed by the risks of protracted lawsuits.

In late 2006, the foundation sent out a holiday card featuring a picture of &quot;Electric Cord&quot; (1961), a painting that had been missing since 1970 after being sent out to art restorer Daniel Goldreyer by the Leo Castelli Gallery. The card urged the public to report any information about its whereabouts. In 2012, the foundation authenticated the piece when it surfaced at a New York City warehouse.

Between 2008 and 2012, following the death of photographer Harry Shunk in 2006, the Lichtenstein Foundation acquired the collection of photographic material shot by Shunk and his collaborator János Kender as well as the photographers&#x27; copyright. In 2013, the foundation donated the Shunk-Kender trove to five institutions – Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles; the Museum of Modern Art in New York; the National Gallery of Art in Washington; the Centre Pompidou in Paris; and the Tate in London – that will allow each museum access to the others&#x27; share.

== Art market ==
Since the 1950s Lichtenstein&#x27;s work has been exhibited in New York and elsewhere with Leo Castelli at his gallery and at Castelli Graphics as well as with Ileana Sonnabend in her gallery in Paris, and at the Ferus Gallery, Pace Gallery, Gagosian Gallery, Mitchell-Innes &amp; Nash, Mary Boone, Brooke Alexander Gallery, Carlebach, Rosa Esman, Marilyn Pearl, James Goodman, John Heller, Blum Helman, Hirschl &amp; Adler, Phyllis Kind, Getler Pall, Condon Riley, 65 Thompson Street, Holly Solomon, and Sperone Westwater Galleries among others. Leo Castelli Gallery represented Lichtenstein exclusively since 1962, when a solo show by the artist sold out before it opened.

Beginning in 1962, the Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, held regular exhibitions of the artist&#x27;s work. Gagosian Gallery has been exhibiting work by Lichtenstein since 1996.

&quot;Big Painting No. 6&quot; (1965) became the highest priced Lichtenstein work in 1970. Like the entire Brushstrokes series, the subject of the painting is the process of Abstract Expressionist painting via sweeping brushstrokes and drips, but the result of Lichtenstein&#x27;s simplification that uses a Ben-Day dots background is a representation of the mechanical/industrial color printing reproduction.

Lichtenstein&#x27;s painting &quot;Torpedo ... Los!&quot; (1963) sold at Christie&#x27;s for $5.5 million in 1989, a record sum at the time, making him one of only three living artists to have attracted such huge sums. In 2005, &quot;In the Car&quot; was sold for a then record $16.2m (£10m).

In 2010, Lichtenstein&#x27;s cartoon-style 1964 painting &quot;Ohhh...Alright...&quot;, previously owned by Steve Martin and later by Steve Wynn, was sold at a record US$42.6m (£26.7m) at a sale at Christie&#x27;s in New York.

Based on a 1961 William Overgard drawing for a &quot;Steve Roper&quot; cartoon story, Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;I Can See the Whole Room...and There&#x27;s Nobody in It!&quot; (1961) depicts a man looking through a hole in a door. It was sold by collector Courtney Sale Ross for $43 million, double its estimate, at Christie&#x27;s in New York City in 2011; the seller&#x27;s husband, Steve Ross had acquired it at auction in 1988 for $2.1 million. The painting measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil.

The comic painting &quot;Sleeping Girl&quot; (1964) from the collection of Beatrice and Phillip Gersh established a new Lichtenstein record $44.8 million at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2012.

In October 2012, Lichtenstein&#x27;s painting &quot;Electric Cord&quot; (1962) was returned to Leo Castelli&#x27;s widow Barbara Bertozzi Castelli, after having been missing for 42 years. Castelli had sent the painting to an art restorer for cleaning in January 1970, and never got it back. He died in 1999. In 2006, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation published an image of the painting on its holiday greeting card and asked the art community to help find it. The painting was found in a New York warehouse, after having been displayed in Bogota, Colombia.

In 2013, the painting &quot;Woman with Flowered Hat&quot; set another record at $56.1 million as it was purchased by British jeweller Laurence Graff from American investor Ronald O. Perelman.

This was topped in 2015 by the sale of &quot;Nurse&quot; for 95.4 million dollars at a Christie&#x27;s auction.

In January 2017, &quot;Masterpiece&quot; was sold for $165 million. The proceeds of this sale will be used to create a fund for criminal justice reform.

<text>Wireless community networks or wireless community projects or simply community networks, are non-centralized, self-managed and collaborative networks organized in a grassroots fashion by communities, non-governmental organizations and cooperatives in order to provide a viable alternative to municipal wireless networks for consumers.

Many of these organizations set up wireless mesh networks which rely primarily on sharing of unmetered residential and business DSL and cable Internet. This sort of usage might be non-compliant with the terms of service of local internet service provider (ISPs) that deliver their service via the consumer phone and cable duopoly. Wireless community networks sometimes advocate complete freedom from censorship, and this position may be at odds with the acceptable use policies of some commercial services used. Some ISPs do allow sharing or reselling of bandwidth.

The First Latin American Summit of Community Networks, held in Argentina in 2018, presented the following definition for the term &quot;community network&quot;: &quot;Community networks are networks collectively owned and managed by the community for non-profit and community purposes. They are constituted by collectives, indigenous communities or non-profit civil society organizations that exercise their right to communicate, under the principles of democratic participation of their members, fairness, gender equality, diversity and plurality&quot;.

According to the Declaration on Community Connectivity, elaborated through a multistakeholder process organized by the Internet Governance Forum&#x27;s Dynamic Coalition on Community Connectivity, community networks are recognised by a list of characteristics: Collective ownership; Social management; Open design; Open participation; Promotion of peering and transit; Promotion of the consideration of security and privacy concerns while designing and operating the network; and promotion of the development and circulation of local content in local languages.

==History==

Wireless community networks started as projects that evolved from amateur radio using packet radio, and from the free software community which substantially overlapped with the amateur radio community. Wireless neighborhood networks were established by technology enthusiasts in the early 2000s. The Redbricks Intranet Collective (RIC) started 1999 in Manchester, UK, to allow about 30 flats in the Bentley House Estate to share the subscription cost of one leased line from British Telecom (BT). Wi-Fi was quickly adopted by technology enthusiasts and hobbyists, because it was an open standard and consumer Wi-Fi hardware was comparatively cheap.

Wireless community networks started out by turning wireless access points designed for short-range use in homes into multi-kilometre long-range Wi-Fi by building high-gain directional antennas. Rather than buying commercially available units, some of the early groups advocated home-built antennas. Examples include the cantenna and RONJA, an optical link that can be made from a smoke flue and LEDs. The circuitry and instructions for such DIY networking antennas were released under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL). Municipal wireless networks, funded by local governments, started being deployed from 2003 onward.

Regarding the international policy scenario, discussions on Community Networks have gained prominence over the last few years, especially since the creation of the Internet Governance Forum&#x27;s Dynamic Coalition on Community Connectivity in 2016, providing &quot;a much needed platform through which various individuals and entities interested in the advancement of CNs have the possibility to associate, organise and develop, in a bottom-up participatory fashion collective &#x27;principles, rules, decision-making procedures and shared programs that give shape to the evolution and use of the Internet.&#x27;&quot;.

===Early community projects===

By 2003, a number of wireless community projects had established themselves in urban areas across North America, Europe and Australia. In June 2000, Melbourne Wireless Inc. was established in Melbourne Australia as a not-for-profit project to establish a metropolitan area wireless network using off-the-shelf 802.11 wireless equipment. By 2003, it had 1,200 hotspots. In 2000 Seattle Wireless was founded with the stated aim of providing free WiFi access and share the cost of Internet connectivity in Seattle, USA. By April 2011, it had 80 free wireless access points all over Seattle and was steadily growing.

In August 2000, Consume was founded in London England as &quot;collaborative strategy for the self provisioning of a broadband telecommunications infrastructure&quot;. Founded by Ben Laurie and others, Consume aimed to build a wireless infrastructure as alternative to the monopoly-held wired metropolitan area network. Besides providing Wi-Fi access in East London, Consume installed a large antenna on the roof of the former Greenwich Town Hall and documented the states of wireless connections in London. Consume created political pressure on municipal authorities, by staging public events, exhibitions, encouraging consumers to set up wireless equipment and setting up temporary Wi-Fi hotspots at events in East London. While Consume generated sustained media attention, it did not establish a lasting wireless community network.

The Wireless Leiden hobbyist project was established in September 2001 and constituted as non-profit foundation in 2003 with more than 300 active users. The Wireless Leiden foundation aimed to facilitate the cooperation of local government, businesses and residents to provide wireless networking in Leiden Netherlands. The first wireless community network in Spain was RedLibre, founded in September 2001 in Madrid. By 2002 RedLibre coordinated the efforts of 15 local wireless groups and maintained free RedLibre Wi-Fi hotspots in five cities. RedLibre has been credited for facilitating the widespread availability of WLAN in the urban areas of Spain.

In Italy, Ninux.org was founded by students and hackers in 2001 to create a grassroots wireless network in Rome, similar to Seattle Wireless. A turning point for Ninux was the lowering of prices in 2008 for consumer wireless equipment, such as antennas and routers. Ninux volunteers installed an increasing number of antennas on the roofs of Rome. The network served as example for other urban community wireless networks in Italy. By 2016, similar wireless networks had been installed in Florence, Bolongna, Pisa and Cosenza. While they share common technical and organizational frameworks, the working groups supporting these urban wireless community networks are driven by the different needs of the city in which they operate.
Houston Wireless was founded in summer 2001 as the Houston Wireless Users Group. The telecommunications providers were slow to roll out third-generation wireless (3G), so Houston Wireless was established to promote high-speed wireless access across Houston and its suburbs. Houston Wireless experimented with network protocols such as IPsec, mobile IP and IPv6, as well as wireless technologies, including 802.11a, 802.11g and ultra-wideband (UWB). By 2003, it had 30 WLAN hotspots, 100 people on their mailing lists and their monthly meetings were attended by about 25 people.

NYCwirelsss was established in New York City in May 2001 to provide public hotspots and promote the use of consumer owned unlicensed low-cost wireless networking equipment. In order to get more public Wi-Fi hotspots installed, NYCwirelsss contracted with the for-profit company Cloud Networks, which was staffed by some of the founding members of the NYCwireless community project. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 NYCwirelsss helped to provide emergency communication by quickly assembling and deploying free Wi-Fi hotspots in areas of New York City that had no other telecommunications. In summer 2002, the Bryant Park wireless network became the flagship project of NYCwireless, with about 50 users every day. By 2003 NYCwireless had more than 100 active hotspots throughout New York City.

===Early project in rural areas===

In 2000, guifi.net was founded because commercial internet service providers did not build a broadband Internet infrastructure in rural Catalonia. Guifi.net was conceived as a wireless mesh network, where households can become a node in the network by operating a radio transmitter. Not every node needs to be a wireless router, but the network relies on some volunteers being connected to the Internet and sharing that access with others. In 2017 guifi.net had 23,000 nodes and was described as the biggest mesh network in the world.

In 2001, BCWireless founded to help communities in British Columbia, Canada, set up local Wi-Fi networks. BCWireless hobbyists experimented with IEEE 802.11b wireless networks and antennas to extend the range and power of signal, allow bandwidth sharing among local group members and establish wireless mesh networks. The Lac Seul First Nation communities set up their Wi-Fi network and constituted the non-profit K-Net to manage a wireless network based on IEEE 802.11g to provide the entire reserve with Wi-Fi using the unlicensed spectrum in combination with licensed spectrum at 3.5 GHz.

===Co-operation between community networks===
For the most, early wireless community projects had a local scope, but many still had a global awareness. In 2003, wireless community networks initiated the &quot;Pico Peering Agreement&quot; (PPA) and the &quot;Wireless Commons Manifesto&quot;. The two initiatives defined attempts to build an infrastructure, so that local wireless mesh networks could become extensive wireless ad hoc networks across local and national boundaries. In 2004, Freifunk released the OpenWrt-based firmware FFF for Wi-Fi devices that participate in a community network, which included a PPA, so that the owner of the node agrees to provide free transit across the network.

==Technical approach==

There are at least three technical approaches to building a wireless community network:
* Cluster: Advocacy groups which simply encourage sharing of unmetered internet bandwidth via Wi-Fi, may also index nodes, suggest uniform SSID (for low-quality roaming), supply equipment, DNS services, etc.
* Wireless mesh network: Technology groups which coordinate building a mesh network to provide Wi-Fi access to the internet
* Device-as-infrastructure: In 2013 the Open Technology Institute released the Commotion Wireless mesh network firmware, which allows Wi-Fi enabled mobile phones and computers to join a wireless community network by establishing a peer-to-peer network that still works when not connected to the wide area network.

===Firmware===
Wireless equipment, like many other consumer electronics, comes with hard-to-alter firmware that is preinstalled by the manufacturer. When the Linksys WRT54G series was launched in 2003 with an open source Linux kernel as firmware, it immediately became the subject of hacks and became the most popular hardware among community wireless volunteers. In 2005, Linksys released the WRT54GL version of its firmware, to make it even easier for customers to modify it. Community network hackers experimented with increasing the transmission power of the Linksys WRT54G or increasing the clock speed of the CPU to speed up data transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adrian Mackenzie 2010 https://archive.org/details/wirelessnessradi00mack_048/page/n113 110&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Hobbyists got another boost when in 2004 the OpenWrt firmware was released as open source alternative to proprietary firmware. The Linux-based embedded operating system could be used on embedded devices to route network traffic. Through successive versions, OpenWrt eventually could work on several hundred types of wireless devices and Wi-Fi routers. OpenWrt was named in honor of the WRT54G. The OpenWrt developers provided extensive documentation and the ability to include one&#x27;s own code in the OpenWrt source code and compile the firmware.

In 2004, Freifunk released the FFF firmware for wireless community projects, which modified OpenWrt so that the node could be configured via a web interface and added features to better support a wireless ad hoc network with traffic shaping, statistics, Internet gateway support and an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR). A Wi-Fi access point that booting the FFF firmware joined the network by automatically announcing its Internet gateway capabilities to other nodes using OLSR HNA4. When a node disappeared, the other nodes registered the change in the network topology through the discontinuation of HNA4 announcements. At the time, Freifunk in Berlin had 500 Wi-Fi access points and about 2,200 Berlin residents used the network free of charge. The Freifunk FFF firmware is among the oldest approaches to establishing a wireless mesh network at significant scale. Other early attempts at developing an operating system for wireless devices that supported large scale wireless community projects were Open-Mesh and Netsukuku.

In 2006, Meraki Networks Inc was founded. The Meraki hardware and firmware had been developed as part of a PhD research project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to provide wireless access to graduate students. For years, the low-cost Meraki products fueled the growth of wireless mesh networks in 25 countries. Early Meraki-based wireless community networks included the Free-the-Net Meraki mesh in Vancouver, Canada. Constituted in 2006 as legal co-operative, members of the Vancouver Open Network Initiatives Cooperative paid five Canadian dollars per month to access the community wireless network provided by individuals who attached Meraki nodes to their home wireless connection, sharing bandwidth with any cooperative members nearby and participating in a meshed wireless network.

===Community network software===
By 2003, the Sidney Wireless community project had launched the NodeDB software, to facilitate the work of community networks by mapping the nodes participating in a wireless mesh network. Nodes needed to be registered in the database, but the software generated a list of adjacent nodes. When registering a node that participated in a community network, the maintainer of the node could leave a note on the hardware, antenna reach and firmware in operation and so find other network community members who were willing to participate in a mesh.

==Organization==
Organizationally, a wireless community network requires either a set of affordable commercial technical solutions or a critical mass of hobbyists willing to tinker to maintain operations. Mesh networks require that a high level of community participation and commitment be maintained for the network to be viable. The mesh approach currently requires uniform equipment. One market-driven aspect of the mesh approach is that users who receive a weak mesh signal can often convert it to a strong signal by obtaining and operating a repeater node, thus extending the network. 

Such volunteer organizations focusing on technology that is rapidly advancing sometimes have schisms and mergers. The Wi-Fi service provided by such groups is usually free and without the stigma of piggybacking. An alternative to the voluntary model is to use a co-operative structure.

===Business models===
Wireless community projects made volunteer bandwidth-sharing technically feasible and have been credited with contributing to the emergence of alternative business models in the consumer Wi-Fi market. The commercial Wi-Fi provider Fon was established in 2006 in Spain. Fon customers were equipped with a Linksys Wi-Fi access point that runs a modified OpenWrt firmware so that Fon customers shared Wi-Fi access among each other. Public Wi-Fi provisioning through FON customers was broadened when FON entered a 50% revenue-sharing agreement with customers who made their entire unused bandwidth available for resale. In 2009, this business model gained broader acceptance when British Telecom allowed its own home customers to sell unused bandwidth to BT and FON roamers.

Wireless community projects for the most provide best-effort Wi-Fi coverage. However, since the mid-2000s local authorities started to contract with wireless community networks to provide municipal wireless networks or stable Wi-Fi access in a defined urban area, such as a park. Wireless community networks started to participate in a variety of public-private partnerships. The non-profit community network ZAP Sherbrooke has partnered with public and private entities to provide Wi-Fi access and received financial support from the University of Sherbrooke and Bishop&#x27;s University to extend the coverage of its wireless mesh throughout the city of Sherbrooke, Canada.

==Regulation==
Certain countries regulate the selling of internet access, requiring a license to sell internet access over a wireless network. In South Africa it is regulated by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). They require that WISP&#x27;s apply for a VANS or ECNS/ECS license before being allowed to resell internet access over a wireless link. The Internet Society&#x27;s publication &quot;Community Networks in Latin America: Challenges, Regulations and Solutions&quot; brings a summary of regulations regarding Community Networks among Latin American countries, the United States and Canada.

<text>The Rolling Stones (also published under the name Space Family Stone in the United Kingdom) is a 1952 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein.

A condensed version of the novel had been published earlier in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; (September, October, November, December 1952) under the title &quot;Tramp Space Ship&quot;. It was published in hardcover that year by Scribner&#x27;s as part of the Heinlein juveniles.

==Plot summary==
The Stones, a family of &quot;Loonies&quot; (residents of the Moon), purchase and restore a used spaceship and go sightseeing around the Solar System.

The twin teenage boys, named Castor and Pollux after the half-brothers of classical legend, buy used bicycles to sell on Mars, their first stop, where they run afoul of local regulations, but their grandmother Hazel Stone saves them from jail. While on Mars, the twins buy their brother Buster a native Martian creature called a flat cat, which produces a soothing vibration, as a pet.

Instead of returning home as originally planned, they decide to travel to the asteroid belt, where the equivalent of a gold rush is in progress, prospecting for &quot;core material&quot; and radioactive ores. The twins obtain supplies and luxury goods on Mars to sell at their destination, on the principle that it is shopkeepers, not miners, who get rich during gold rushes. &quot;En route&quot;, the rapidly maturing, fertile (and pregnant) flat cat and its offspring quickly cause a population explosion aboard, so the family places them in hibernation and later sells them to the miners. 

After an adventure or two, the family sets out to see the rings of Saturn.

===Flat cat===
In the novel, flat cats are a species of Martian animal which reproduce rapidly and overrun a spaceship. In the chapter &quot;Free Enterprise&quot;, the character Mr. Angelo, a shopkeeper on Mars, introduces Castor and Pollux Stone to a flat cat:

The boys take the flat cat onto the family space ship, where it soon has eight &quot;kittens&quot;, each of which soon gives birth again, until the ship is overwhelmed with flat cats. The family solves the problem by rounding up the flat cats and putting them into the storage hold at low temperature, where they hibernate. They are later revived and sold to miners in the asteroid belt.

==Research==
As with his other novels, Heinlein and his wife Virginia &quot;spent countless hours in research, fiercely dedicated to &quot;getting it right&quot; for their readers.&quot;

==Influences==
Heinlein credited the 1905 Ellis Parker Butler short story &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot; with inspiring the flat cat incident.

===Flat cats v. tribbles ===
A similar concept and plotline appeared later in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;. According to screenwriter David Gerrold, the show&#x27;s producers noticed similarities in the two stories and asked Heinlein for permission to use the idea. Heinlein asked for an autographed copy of the script, but otherwise did not object, noting that both stories owed something to the 1905 Ellis Parker Butler story &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot; -- &quot;and possibly to Noah&quot;.

The similarities to the flat cats and some specific story events involving them was brought to the attention of the Star Trek staff when Desilu/Paramount&#x27;s primary in-house clearance group, Kellam de Forest Research, submitted a report on the script on August 11, 1967, noting the similarities of &quot;a small, featureless, fluffy, purring animal, friendly and loving, that reproduces rapidly when fed, and nearly engulfs a spaceship&quot;. So worrisome was this matter that the producers contacted Heinlein and asked for a waiver, which Heinlein granted. In his authorized biography, Heinlein said he was called by producer Gene Coon about the issue and agreed to waive claim to the &quot;similarity&quot; to his flat cats because he’d just been through one plagiarism lawsuit and did not wish to embroil himself in another. He had misgivings upon seeing the actual script but let it go, an action he later regretted:

Heinlein freely acknowledged that he took some inspiration from the Butler story, but was careful not to plagiarize him, and the similarities are primarily that the creatures reproduce rapidly and overrun a place. Conversely, the tribbles copy not only the flat cats&#x27; general appearance, behavior, the effects of their purring on people, and the particulars of their reproduction when fed and unfed—but that they are obtained from a merchant who does not warn customers of their dangers, and ultimately unloaded from the ship onto another unsuspecting party.

The screenwriter of the episode, David Gerrold, admits that he had read the Heinlein book years before writing his screenplay but claims he was not consciously aware of the similarities until the Kellam de Forest report. According to him, Heinlein asked only for an autographed copy of the script and, in a note to Gerrold, &quot;Let me add that I felt that the analogy to my flat cats was mild enough to be of no importance&quot;.

==Connections to other Heinlein works==

In Chapter XIII (&quot;Caveat Vendor&quot;), Hazel Stone tells the judge, &quot;I am a stranger here in a strange land&quot; (paraphrasing ). Heinlein later used the same Biblical quote as the title of his Hugo-award winning novel of 1961.

The book makes several references to Hazel as an influential figure in founding the Lunar colony. Fourteen years later, Heinlein published &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, which tells the story of the Lunar revolution, including a small but vital role that Hazel Stone played as a child (no specifics of this role are mentioned in &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;; she is portrayed here simply as a &quot;founding Father&quot;). Hazel, Castor, and Pollux reappear in &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;. Hazel, alone, appears in &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;.

Dr. Lowell Stone (&quot;Buster&quot;) is quoted in a chapter heading in &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; and referenced as Chief Surgeon at Ceres General. In that same book, Hazel states that Roger and Edith are now living in the extrasolar colony known as Fiddler&#x27;s Green (itself first named in &quot;Friday&quot;).

The general description of the Martian met by Lowell is similar to the description of the Martians depicted in &quot;Red Planet&quot; and later in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;.

==Reception==
Jo Walton writes that as a teenager, she considered the book one of the weakest of the Heinlein juveniles; upon rereading it as an adult, it &quot;leaves me feeling I can&#x27;t get no satisfaction.&quot; Both Walton and James Nicoll criticize the book&#x27;s sexual politics, with Nicoll specifically stating that &quot;(t)he [book&#x27;s] sexual politics are tragic.&quot; Heinlein himself wrote, in a letter to his agent after he had finished the first quarter of the book, that it had &quot;an unsatisfactory story line thereafter,&quot; and that he found a &quot;domestic comedy&quot; &quot;harder to write&quot; than &quot;revolutions and blood.&quot;

Groff Conklin described the novel as &quot;a thoroughly delightful job&quot;. Boucher and McComas praised it as &quot;easily the most plausible, carefully detailed picture of an interplanetary future we will encounter in any year&quot;. P. Schuyler Miller cited the novel&#x27;s &quot;freshness and simplicity,&quot; characterizing it as &quot;a life-size portrait-gallery of real people living in a real world of the future, every detail of which fits into place with top-tolerance precision&quot;.

Surveying Heinlein&#x27;s juvenile novels, Jack Williamson characterized Heinlein&#x27;s story as &quot;a dream of personal freedom&quot; written with &quot;an enviable craftsmanship&quot;, noted that the novel &quot;carries its thematic burden tightly&quot;, unlike Heinlein&#x27;s later adult novels, and praised &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; for its &quot;sense of an accurately extrapolated future background, with all of the new technologies given an air of commonplace reality&quot;.

<text>The Door into Summer is a science fiction novel by American science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally serialized in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; (October, November, December 1956, with covers and interior illustrations by Kelly Freas). It was published in hardcover in 1957.

== Plot ==
The idea for the novel came from an incident outlined by Heinlein later:

The novel opens in 1970 with Daniel Boone Davis, an engineer and inventor, well into a long drinking binge. He has lost his company, Hired Girl, Inc., to his partner Miles Gentry and the company bookkeeper, Belle Darkin. Darkin had been Dan&#x27;s fiancée, deceiving him into giving her enough voting stock to allow her and Miles to seize control. Dan&#x27;s only friend in the world is his cat, &quot;Pete&quot; (short for Petronius the Arbiter), a feisty tomcat who hates going outdoors in the snow.

Hired Girl, Inc. manufactures robot vacuum cleaners, but Dan had been developing a new line of all-purpose household robots, Flexible Frank, when Miles announces his intention to sell the company (and Flexible Frank) to Mannix Enterprises in which Miles would become a vice president. Wishing to stay independent, Dan opposes the takeover, but is outvoted and then fired as Chief Engineer. Left with a large financial settlement, and his remaining Hired Girl stock, he elects to take &quot;cold sleep&quot; (suspended animation), hoping to wake up thirty years later to a brighter future. The examining doctor at the cold sleep facility immediately sees that Dan has been drinking. He warns him to show up sober or not at all 24 hours later for the actual procedure.

After becoming sober, Dan decides instead to mount a counter-attack. First he mails his Hired Girl stock certificate to the one person he trusts, Miles&#x27; stepdaughter Frederica &quot;Ricky&quot; Virginia Gentry. Dan confronts Miles and finds Belle in Miles&#x27; home. Belle injects him with an illegal &quot;zombie&quot; drug, reducing him to somnolent compliance. Belle and Miles discover Dan&#x27;s plans to go into cold sleep and have him committed, but to a different repository run by one of Belle&#x27;s shady associates for the Mannix corporation.

Dan wakes up in the year 2000 with no money to his name and no idea how to find the people he once knew. What little money Belle let him keep went with the collapse of Mannix in 1987. He has lost Pete the cat, who fled Miles&#x27; house after Dan was drugged, and has no idea how to find a now middle-aged Ricky.

Dan begins rebuilding his life. He persuades Geary Manufacturing, which now owns Hired Girl, to take him on as a figurehead. He discovers that Miles died in 1972, while Belle has become a shrill and gin-sodden wreck. All she recalls is that Ricky went to live with her grandmother about the time Dan went into cold sleep. Her scheme with Miles collapsed, as the Flexible Frank prototype disappeared the same night she shanghaied Dan.

Dan finds Flexible Frank in use everywhere, filling many menial jobs once filled by people. It is called &quot;Eager Beaver&quot;, made by a company called &quot;Aladdin Auto-engineering.&quot; Dan can see that someone has taken his prototype and developed it. He is even more baffled to find that the patent is credited to a &quot;D.B. Davis&quot;.

His friend Chuck at Geary lets slip that he once saw time travel working, in a lab in Colorado. At that point Dan finds that Ricky has been awakened from cold sleep and left Los Angeles for Brawley, California. Dan tracks her to Yuma, Arizona, where she was apparently married. When Dan looks at the marriage register, he finds that she married &quot;Daniel Boone Davis&quot;. He immediately empties his bank account and heads for Colorado.

In Boulder, he befriends Dr. Twitchell, a once-brilliant scientist reduced to drinking away his frustrations. Eventually, Twitchell admits to having created a time machine of sorts. With the machine powered up, Dan goads Twitchell into sending him back to 1970, some months before his confrontation with Miles and Belle. He materializes in a Denver naturist retreat in front of a couple, John and Jenny Sutton, whom he befriends. The husband, a lawyer by trade, helps Dan cash in the gold he has brought back with him. In the future gold is no longer a coinage metal and costs a fraction of its value in 1970.

Working rapidly, Dan creates &quot;Drafting Dan&quot;, an automated drafting machine, which he then uses to design &quot;Protean Pete&quot;, the first version of Eager Beaver. He sets up a new corporation with the Suttons called &quot;Aladdin Auto-engineering&quot;, returns to Los Angeles, and stakes out Miles&#x27; house on the fateful night. Watching himself arrive, he lets events unfold until Pete the cat emerges, then takes his own car and uses it to remove Flexible Frank and all his engineering drawings from Miles&#x27; garage.

Destroying the drawings and scattering machine parts across the landscape, he heads out to meet Ricky at her Girl Scout summer camp. Dan assigns his stock in Hired Girl to Ricky and suggests that she takes cold sleep when she is 21 so they can meet again. Ricky asks Dan if he will marry her after their cold sleep and Dan agrees. Dan returns to Los Angeles to use his original appointment for cold sleep, pleading that he lost the original paperwork.

With Pete in his arms, he sleeps for the second time until 2001. He greets Ricky, now twenty-one, when she awakes. They leave for Brawley to retrieve her possessions from storage, and then are married in Yuma. Setting himself up as an independent inventor, he uses Ricky&#x27;s Hired Girl stock to make changes at Geary, settling back to watch the healthy competition with Aladdin.

== Major themes ==
Some of Heinlein&#x27;s stories, such as &quot;&#x27;—All You Zombies—&#x27;&quot; and &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot;, feature time travel in which the protagonist re-creates himself using a time-travel paradox. This novel follows a similar theme, although the paradox is not central to the story. The idea recurs in the 1964 novel &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot;, which hurls its protagonists into the future and then returns them to their own time, where they alter their destiny.

The novel is also post-apocalyptic, in that it takes place after a nuclear armed conflict. The United States was the clear victor, thanks to technologies that include the &quot;cold sleep&quot;, which was used to maintain a large standing army that could be revived quickly and put into the field. The &quot;zombie drug&quot; used was a by-product of interrogation techniques. In the future time, &quot;zombie recruiters&quot; are apparently active, suggesting that the drug is widely used to recruit a form of slave labor.

It is mentioned that Washington, D.C., was destroyed, with the capital moved to Denver, Colorado, and there were also some hits on the East Coast and in Texas. However, the book in effect makes light of it. The United States rapidly recovers, refugees from devastated areas move to unharmed places, especially California, and the nuclear war leaves no lasting trauma. The 1984 book &quot;Warday&quot; by Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka takes up a limited nuclear attack in precisely the locations mentioned in Heinlein&#x27;s book and depicts how hugely destructive it could be.

The early Heinlein biographer and critic Alexei Panshin, in his 1968 biography &quot;Heinlein in Dimension&quot;, took note of a controversial theme: &quot;The romantic situation in this story is a very interesting, very odd one: it is nothing less than a mutual sexual interest between an engineer of thirty and a girl of twelve (&#x27;adorable&#x27; is Heinlein&#x27;s word for her), that culminates in marriage after some hop-scotching around in time to adjust their ages a bit.&quot;

==Characters==
*Daniel Boone Davis, reflecting much of the author&#x27;s own character. An engineer and inventor, he is a fierce individualist. The only friends he has in the world are his cat Pete and young Ricky, wise beyond her years.
*Miles Gentry, Dan&#x27;s former Army buddy and business partner, handling the financial and legal side.
*Belle S. Darkin, who presents herself to Miles and Dan when they most need help with the company. She is apparently a brilliant secretary, bookkeeper and office manager who is willing to work for a pittance. In reality she is an accomplished fraud artist with an extensive criminal record, several aliases, and a number of previous marriages which were never dissolved. She seduces first Dan, then Miles.
*Frederica Virginia &quot;Ricky&quot; Heinicke, physically an 11-year-old girl but emotionally almost adult. Like all Heinlein&#x27;s heroines from this period, she is an intelligent redhead, and clearly modeled on Virginia Heinlein, even having a version of her name and her childhood nickname, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.

== Reception ==
The novel &quot;worried and bothered&quot; John W. Campbell, who said &quot;Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands. But Jesus, I wish that son of a gun would take that other hand out of his pocket.&quot;

Science fiction writer and critic James Blish, writing in 1957, shortly after publication, criticized the lack of characterization of its hero Dan Davis, saying, &quot;It is surely an odd novel that is at its &quot;best&quot; when the author is openly editorializing ...&quot; — in this case about the &quot;parity system of farm price supports, which in 2000 is applied to automobiles. ... Every other important subject of science fiction which Heinlein has examined at length has come out remade, vitalized and made the author&#x27;s own property. It didn&#x27;t happen here, for the first time in Heinlein&#x27;s long and distinguished career — and not because Heinlein didn&#x27;t have something to say, but because he failed to embody it in a real protagonist. Evidently, Heinlein as his own hero is about played out.&quot; Floyd C. Gale was more positive in his 1957 review, comparing the book to &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot; and writing that &quot;Heinlein paints a detailed picture of both civilizations, so evocative that 1970 emerges clearly in the reader&#x27;s mind as the old days, and pretty primitive at that ... Of course you&#x27;ll like Heinlein&#x27;s latest&quot;. The critic Alexei Panshin, writing in 1968, said that &quot;as a whole, the story is thoroughly melodramatic but very good fun. ... It was as though Heinlein the engineer said, &#x27;If I had the parts available, what little gadgets would I most enjoy building?&#x27; and then went ahead and built them fictionally. A good story.&quot; After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed &quot;The Door Into Summer&quot; as among stories &quot;that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical&quot;.

In three &quot;Locus&quot; magazine readers&#x27; polls from 1975 to 1998, it was judged the 36th, 29th, and the 43rd all-time best science-fiction novel.

In 2019, James Nicoll described it as &quot;an evergreen novel in the sense that it somehow manages to be even more problematic every time I reread it&quot;, and noted that a major component of the plot is &quot;middle aged man grooming a tween&quot;; Nicoll did, however, concede that &quot;[Heinlein] gets the future wrong but does so entertainingly. Some of his robot and gadget ideas are interesting.&quot;

==Adaptations==

CREDEUS Inc. adapted the novel into the feature film &quot;夏への扉 キミのいる未来へ (The Door into Summer)&quot;, which was directed by Takahiro Miki and released on February 19, 2021. It closely follows the original plot, with the setting changed from the United States in 1970 and 2000 to Japan in 1995 and 2025.

== In popular culture ==
In 1967, the American rock group The Monkees, recorded the song &quot;The Door into Summer&quot; for their album &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot; The song was written by Chip Douglas and Bill Martin and performed by Michael Nesmith (lead vocals) and Micky Dolenz (back-up vocals). In a livestream interview in 2020, Nesmith directly attributes the inspiration for the song to the story about Heinlein&#x27;s cat looking for the &quot;Door into Summer&quot;. The song is about longing and regret for a life based primarily on the accumulation of material things. Other than the title, the song has little to do with the story told in the novel.

<doc id="60148" wikidata="Q155057" url="?curid=60148" title="Jasper Johns">
<text>Jasper Johns (born May 15, 1930) is an American painter, sculptor, draftsman, and printmaker. Considered a central figure in the development of American postwar art, he has been variously associated with abstract expressionism, Neo-Dada, and pop art movements.

Johns was born in Augusta, Georgia, and raised in South Carolina. He graduated as valedictorian from Edmunds High School in 1947 and briefly studied art at the University of South Carolina before moving to New York City and enrolling at Parsons School of Design. His education was interrupted by military service during the Korean War. After returning to New York in 1953, he worked at Marboro Books and began associations with key figures in the art world, including Robert Rauschenberg, with whom he had a romantic relationship until 1961. The two were also close collaborators, and Rauschenberg became a profound artistic influence.

Johns&#x27;s art career took a decisive turn in 1954 when he destroyed his existing artwork and began creating paintings of flags, maps, targets, letters, and numbers for which he became most recognized. These works, characterized by their incorporation of familiar symbols, marked a departure from the individualism of Abstract Expressionist style and posed questions about the nature of representation. His use of familiar imagery, such as the American flag, played on the ambiguity of symbols, and this thematic exploration continued throughout his career in various mediums, including sculpture and printmaking.

Among other honors, Johns received the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 1988, the National Medal of Arts in 1990, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1973 and the American Philosophical Society in 2007. He has supported the Merce Cunningham Dance Company and contributed significantly to the National Gallery of Art&#x27;s print collection. Johns is also a co-founder of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. He currently lives and works in Connecticut. In 2010, his 1958 painting &quot;Flag&quot; was sold for a reported $110 million in a private transaction, becoming the most expensive artwork sold by a living artist.

==Life==
Born in Augusta, Georgia, Jasper Johns spent his early life in Allendale, South Carolina, with his paternal grandparents after his parents divorced. He began drawing at the age of three and knew very early on that he wanted to be an artist, despite having little exposure to the arts where he grew up. His paternal grandfather&#x27;s first wife, Evalina, painted landscapes that hung in the homes of several family members. These paintings were the only artworks Johns remembers seeing in his youth. Following his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1939, Johns spent a year living with his mother and stepfather in Columbia, South Carolina, and then six years living with his Aunt Gladys on Lake Murray, South Carolina. He spent summer holidays with his father, Jasper, Sr., and stepmother, Geraldine Sineath Johns, who encouraged his art by buying materials for him to draw and paint. He graduated as valedictorian of Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother and her family.

Johns studied art for a total of three semesters at the University of South Carolina at Columbia, from 1947 to 1948. Encouraged by his professors, he then moved to New York City and enrolled briefly at the Parsons School of Design in 1949. In 1951, Johns was drafted into the army during the Korean War, serving for two years, first in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and then in Sendai, Japan.

Returning to New York in the summer of 1953, Johns worked at Marboro Books and began to meet some of the artists who would be formative in his early career. These included Sari Dienes, Rachel Rosenthal, and Robert Rauschenberg, with the latter of whom Johns began a romantic and artistic relationship that would last until 1961. During the same period Johns was strongly influenced by the choreographer Merce Cunningham and his partner, the composer John Cage. Working together they explored the contemporary art scene, and began sharing their ideas on art.

In March 1957, while visiting Rauschenberg&#x27;s studio, the gallery owner Leo Castelli asked to see Johns&#x27;s art. As Castelli recalled: &quot;So we went down. It was just the floor below. There was a fantastic display of flags and targets. You know the target with the plastic eyes, the one with the faces. The &quot;Green Target&quot; was at the Jewish Museum, but there was a big white flag, a smaller white flag, numbers, the alphabet, anything—all those great masterpieces.&quot; Castelli immediately offered Johns an exhibition. His first solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery, held in early 1958, was well received; all but two of the eighteen works on view sold. Alfred H. Barr Jr., the founding director of New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, purchased three paintings from the show, which were the first works by Johns to enter a museum collection.

Johns has lived and worked in various homes and studios in New York City throughout his career and, from 1973 to 1987, maintained a rustic 1930s farmhouse with a glass-walled studio in Stony Point, New York. He began visiting the Caribbean island of Saint Martin in the late 1960s, buying property there in 1972, and, later, building a home and studio, for which Philip Johnson was the principal designer. Johns currently lives and works in Sharon, Connecticut.

Following his death, the artist plans to transform his 170-acre property in Sharon, Connecticut, into an artists&#x27; residency. He has lived there since the 1990s. It will provide a live-work space for 18 to 24 artists at a time and will be open to visual artists, poets, musicians, dancers.

==Work==

===Painting===
In 1954, Johns destroyed all of his previous artwork still in his possession and began the paintings for which he is best known: depictions of flags, maps, targets, letters, and numbers. His use of such symbols differentiated his paintings from the gestural abstraction of the Abstract Expressionists, whose works were often understood as expressive of the individual personality or psychology of the artist. With well-known motifs imported into his art, his paintings could be read as both representational (a flag, a target) and as abstract (stripes, circles). Some art historians and museums characterize his choice of subjects as freeing him from decisions about composition. Johns has remarked: &quot;What&#x27;s interesting to me is the fact that it isn&#x27;t designed, but taken. It&#x27;s not mine,&quot; or, that these motifs are &quot;things the mind already knows.&quot;

His early encaustic painting &quot;Flag&quot; (1954–55), painted after having a dream of it, marks the beginning of this new period. The motif allowed Johns to create a painting that was not completely abstract because it depicts a symbol (the American flag), yet it draws attention to the design of the symbol itself. The work evades the personal because it depicts a national symbol, and yet, it maintains a sense of the handmade in Johns&#x27;s wax brushstrokes; it is neither a literal flag, nor a purely abstract painting. The work thus raises a set of complex questions with no clear answers through its combination of symbol and medium. Indeed, Alfred H. Barr could not convince the trustees of the Museum of Modern Art to directly acquire the painting from Johns&#x27;s first solo show, as they were afraid its ambiguity might lead to boycott or attack by patriotic groups during the Cold War climate of the late 1950s. Barr was, however, able to arrange for the architect Philip Johnson to buy the painting and later donate it to the museum in 1973. The flag remains one of Johns&#x27;s most enduring motifs; the art historian Roberta Bernstein recounts that &quot;between 1954 and 2002, he employed virtually his full array of materials and techniques in twenty-seven paintings, ten individual or editioned sculptures, fifty drawings, and eighteen print editions that depict the flag as the primary image.&quot;

Johns is also known for including three-dimensional objects in his paintings. These objects can be either found (the ruler in &quot;Painting with Ruler and &quot;Gray,&quot;&quot; 1960) or specifically made (the plaster reliefs in &quot;Target with Four Faces&quot;, 1955). This practice challenges the typical conception of painting as a two-dimensional realm. Johns&#x27;s early and enduring use of the medium of encaustic also presented the opportunity to experiment with texture. An ancient technique, encaustic is a process whereby melted wax mixed with pigment is applied and &quot;burned into&quot; a support. The method allowed Johns to preserve the discrete quality of individual brushstrokes, even when layered, creating textured yet, at times, transparent surfaces. Johns&#x27;s 2020 work &quot;Slice&quot; reproduces a drawing of a knee by Jéan-Marc Togodgue, a Cameroonian emigre student basketball player who attended the Salisbury School near Johns&#x27;s estate in Sharon. Johns&#x27;s use of Togodgue&#x27;s artwork without first notifying him led to a dispute that was settled amicably.

===Sculpture===
Johns made his first sculpture, &quot;Flashlight I&quot;, in 1958. Many of his earliest sculptures are single, freestanding objects modeled from a material called Sculp-metal, a pliable metallic medium that could be applied and manipulated much like paint or clay. During this period, he also employed casting techniques to make objects out of plaster and bronze. Some of these objects are painted to suggest a certain sense of verisimilitude; &quot;Painted Bronze&quot; (1960), for example, depicts a can painted with the Savarin Coffee label. Filled with cast paintbrushes, the work recalls an object one might find on an artist&#x27;s studio table.

&quot;Numbers&quot; (2007), which depicts his now classic pattern of stenciled numerals repeated in a grid, and is the largest single bronze Johns has made to date. Another sculpture from this period, a double-sided relief titled &quot;Fragment of a Letter&quot; (2009), incorporates part of a letter from Vincent van Gogh to his friend, the artist Émile Bernard. On one side of the relief, Johns pressed each letter of van Gogh&#x27;s words into the wax model. On the other side, he spelled each letter in the American Sign Language alphabet using stamps he designed. Johns signed the wax model with impressions of his own hand, his name finger-spelled in two vertical rows.

===Prints===
Johns began experimenting with printmaking techniques in 1960, when Tatyana Grosman, the founder of Universal Limited Art Editions, Inc. (ULAE), invited him to her printmaking studio on Long Island. Beginning with lithographs that explore the common objects and motifs for which he is best known, such as &quot;Target&quot; (1960), Johns continued to work closely with ULAE, publishing over 180 editions in a variety of printmaking techniques to investigate and develop existing compositions. Initially, lithography suited Johns and enabled him to create print versions of iconic depictions of flags, maps, and targets that filled his paintings. In 1971, Johns became the first artist at ULAE to utilize the handfed offset lithographic press, resulting in &quot;Decoy&quot; — an image realized as a lithograph before it became a drawing or painting.

Johns has worked with other printmakers throughout his career, producing lithographs and lead reliefs at Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles; screenprints with Hiroshi Kawanishi at Simca Prints in New York from 1973–75; and intaglios published by Petersburg Press at Atelier Crommelynck in Paris from 1975–90, including a collaboration with the author Samuel Beckett that resulted in &quot;Foirades/Fizzles&quot; (1976), a book of five text fragments by Beckett in French and English and 33 intaglios by Johns. He produced &quot;Cup 2 Picasso&quot; as an offset lithograph for the June 1973 issue of the magazine &quot;XXe siècle&quot; and, in 2000, completed an edition of 26 linocuts printed by the Grenfell Press and published by Z Press to accompany Jeff Clark&#x27;s &quot;Sun on 6&quot;. For the May 2014 issue of &quot;Art in America&quot;, he created an unnumbered black-and-white off-set lithograph depicting many of his signature motifs.

In 1995, Johns hired master printmaker John Lund and began to construct his own printmaking studio on his property in Sharon, Connecticut. Low Road Studio was officially founded in 1997 as Johns&#x27;s own publishing imprint.

===Collaborations===
For decades Johns worked with others to raise both funds and attention for Merce Cunningham&#x27;s Dance Company. He assisted Robert Rauschenberg in some of his 1950s designs for Cunningham&#x27;s sets and costumes. In spring 1963, Johns and John Cage cofounded the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts (now the Foundation for Contemporary Arts), to raise funds in the performance field. Johns continued his support of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, and served as an artistic adviser from 1967 to 1980. In 1968 Cunningham made a Duchamp-inspired theater piece, &quot;Walkaround Time&quot;, for which Johns&#x27;s set design replicates elements of Duchamp&#x27;s work &quot;The Large Glass&quot; (1915–23). Earlier, Johns also wrote Neo-dada lyrics for The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise music art band that featured prominent members of the New York proto-conceptual art and minimal art community. The National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, owns Chuck Close&#x27;s large-scale portrait of Johns. In the late 1960s Johns&#x27; work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde journal which experimented with language and meaning-making

===Commissions===
In 1963, the architect Philip Johnson commissioned Johns to make a work for what is now the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center. &quot;Numbers&quot; (1964), a 9-by-7-foot grid of numerals, debuted in 1964 and, after presiding over the theater&#x27;s lobby for 35 years, was supposed to be sold by the center for a reported $15 million in 1979. &quot;Numbers&quot; is historically important because it is the largest work of the artist&#x27;s Numbers motif, and each of its Sculp-metal and collage units is on a separate canvas. Responding to widespread criticism, the board of Lincoln Center decided to drop its plans to sell the work, which was Johns&#x27;s first and only public commission.

=== Style ===
Johns&#x27;s work is sometimes grouped with Neo-Dada and pop art: he uses symbols in the Dada tradition of the readymades of Marcel Duchamp, but unlike many pop artists such as Andy Warhol, he does not engage with celebrity culture. Other scholars and museums position Johns and Rauschenberg as predecessors of pop art.

==Valuation and awards==
In 1980 the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, paid $1 million for &quot;Three Flags&quot; (1958), then the highest price ever paid for the work of a living artist. In 1988, Johns&#x27;s &quot;False Start&quot; (1959) was sold at auction at Sotheby&#x27;s to Samuel I. Newhouse Jr. for $17.05 million, setting a record at the time as the highest price paid for a work by a living artist at auction, and the second highest price paid for an artwork at auction in the U.S. In 1998, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, bought Johns&#x27;s &quot;White Flag&quot; (1955), the first painting by the artist to enter the Met&#x27;s collection. While the museum would not disclose how much was paid, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;experts estimate [the painting&#x27;s] value at more than $20 million.&quot; In 2006, Johns&#x27;s &quot;False Start&quot; (1959) again made history. Private collectors Anne and Kenneth Griffin (founder of the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel LLC) purchased the work from David Geffen for $80 million, making it the most expensive painting by a living artist. In 2010, &quot;Flag&quot; (1958), was sold privately to hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen for a reported $110 million (then £73 million; €81.7 million). The seller was Jean-Christophe Castelli, son of Leo Castelli, Johns&#x27;s dealer, who had died in 1999. While the price was not disclosed by the parties, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Cohen paid about $110 million. On November 11, 2014, a 1983 version of &quot;Flag&quot; was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York for $36 million, establishing a new auction record for Johns.

Johns has received many awards throughout his career. The sole honorary degree he has accepted is Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, which the University of South Carolina conferred upon him in 1969. In 1984, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Boston. In 1988, he received the highest honor at the 43rd Venice Biennale—the Golden Lion—for his exhibition in the United States pavilion. Johns was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1989. In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. That year he was also elected an associate national academician of the National Academy of Design (now the National Academy Museum and School), rising to national academician in 1994. In 1993, he received the Praemium Imperiale for painting, a lifetime achievement award from the Japan Art Association. In 1994 he was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1973 and the American Philosophical Society in 2007. On February 15, 2011, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama, becoming the first painter or sculptor to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom since Alexander Calder in 1977.

In 2007, the National Gallery of Art acquired about 1,700 of Johns&#x27;s prints. This made the gallery home to the largest number of Johns&#x27;s works held by a single institution.

<doc id="60149" wikidata="Q4411127" url="?curid=60149" title="Farnham's Freehold">
<text>Farnham&#x27;s Freehold is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. A serialized version, edited by Frederik Pohl, appeared in &quot;Worlds of If&quot; magazine (July, August, and October 1964). The complete version was published in novel form by G. P. Putnam later in 1964.

&quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot; is a post-apocalyptic tale. The setup for the story is a direct hit by a nuclear weapon, catapulting a nuclear shelter containing Farnham, his wife, son, daughter, daughter&#x27;s friend, and employee into the future. While writing the story, Heinlein drew on his experience of building a fallout shelter under his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado in the 1960s.

==Plot==
Hugh Farnham, a white middle-aged man, holds a bridge club party for his alcoholic wife Grace, law-graduate son Duke, college-student daughter Karen, and Karen&#x27;s friend Barbara. During the bridge game, Duke berates Hugh for frightening Grace by preparing for a possible Soviet nuclear attack. When the attack actually occurs the group, along with Joe, the family&#x27;s black servant, retreat to the fallout shelter beneath the house.

After several distant nuclear explosions rock the shelter, Hugh and Barbara become sexually intimate, after which the largest explosion of all hits the shelter. With only minor injuries, but with their bottled oxygen running low, the group decides to ensure that they will be able to leave the shelter when necessary. After exiting through an emergency tunnel, they find themselves in a completely undamaged, semi-tropical region apparently uninhabited by humans or other sentient creatures. Several of the group speculate that the final explosion somehow forced them into an alternate dimension.

The group struggles to stay alive by reverting to the ways of the American pioneers, with Hugh as the leader—despite friction between Hugh and Duke. Karen announces that she is pregnant and had returned home the night of the attack to tell her parents. Barbara also announces that she is pregnant, but without mentioning that her pregnancy resulted from her sexual encounter with Hugh during the attack. Karen eventually dies during her labor, due to complications, along with her infant daughter the next day.

Grace, whose sanity has been challenged by all these events, demands that Barbara be forced from the group or she will leave. Duke convinces Hugh that he will go with Grace to ensure her safety, but before they can leave, a large aircraft appears overhead. The group is taken captive by blacks, but is spared execution when Joe intervenes by conversation with their captors&#x27; leader in French.

The group finds that it has not been transported to another world, but instead is in the distant future of their own world. A decadent but technologically advanced black culture keeps either uneducated or castrated white people as slaves. Sexual slavery and cannibalism are widespread and generally accepted. Adolescent girls are sexually exploited as &quot;bedwarmers&quot; by their owners. Other children are bred on ranches for consumption and slaughtered during puberty (when their flesh is considered particularly tasty) or sometimes earlier.

Each of the characters adapts to the sudden change in black/white roles in different ways. In the end, Hugh and Barbara reject the new era of slavery they find themselves in and attempt to escape, but are captured. Rather than execute them, Ponse, &quot;Lord Protector&quot; of the house to which they have been enslaved, asks them to volunteer for a time-travel experiment that will send them back to their own time.

They return just prior to the original nuclear attack, and flee in Barbara&#x27;s car. As they drive they realize that while Barbara had driven a car with an automatic transmission, this car—the same car in every other respect—has a manual transmission, and Farnham deduces that the time-travel experiment worked but sent them into an alternate universe.

They gather supplies and flee into the hills, surviving the attack, and live out the rest of their lives.

==Reception==
When the novel was published in 1964, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; stated that the &quot;characters have souls of wood pulp&quot; and that &quot;The satire on fall-out shelters, race and sex lacks inspiration.&quot;

The &quot;SF Site&quot; described &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot; as &quot;a difficult book&quot;, and stated that &quot;At best, [it] is an uncomfortable book with some good points mixed in with the bad, like an elderly relative [who] can give good advice and in the next breath go off on some racist or sexist rant. At worst, &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot; is an anti-minority, anti-woman survivalist rant. It is oftentimes frustrating. It is sometimes shocking. It is never boring.&quot; The critical work &quot;The Heritage of Heinlein&quot; describes &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot; as not &quot;an altogether successful novel&quot; and that the book&#x27;s sexism &quot;may be a crucial flaw.&quot;

Charles Stross has rhetorically asked whether &quot;&quot;anyone&quot; [has] a kind word to say for ... &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot;, and then described it as the result of &quot;a privileged white male from California, a notoriously exclusionary state, trying to understand American racism in the pre–Martin Luther King era. And getting it wrong for facepalm values of wrong, so wrong he wasn&#x27;t even on the right map ... but at least he wasn&#x27;t ignoring it.&quot;

&quot;The New Republic&quot;, while conceding Heinlein&#x27;s desire to &quot;show the evils of ethnic oppression&quot;, states that in the process Heinlein &quot;resurrected some of the most horrific racial stereotypes imaginable,&quot; ultimately producing &quot;an anti-racist novel only a Klansman could love.&quot;

==Freeholders==
The name &quot;freeholders&quot; was adopted by some survivalists in the 1980s in reference to the novel.

<text>Gary Ivan Gordon (August 30, 1960 – October 3, 1993) was a master sergeant in the United States Army and a recipient of the Medal of Honor. At the time of his death, he was a non-commissioned officer in the United States Army&#x27;s premier special operations unit, the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1SFOD-D), or &quot;Delta Force&quot;. Together with his comrade, Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart, Gordon was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Mogadishu in October 1993.

==Early life and career==
Gary Gordon was born August 30, 1960, in Lincoln, Maine, and graduated from Mattanawcook Academy in 1978. On December 4 of that year, at age 18, he joined the U.S. Army. Trained as a combat engineer, Gordon became a Special Forces Engineer with the 2nd Battalion of the 10th Special Forces Group. In December 1986, he volunteered and was selected to join the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1SFOD-D), or Delta Force. As a Delta operator, Gordon eventually advanced to Team Sergeant.
Before deploying to Somalia, he married his wife Carmen and they had two children, Brittany and Ian.

==Combat and death in Somalia==
Gordon was posted to Mogadishu, Somalia, with other Delta members in the summer of 1993 as part of Task Force Ranger. On October 3, 1993, Gordon was Sniper Team Leader during the Battle of Mogadishu (1993), which began as a joint-force mission to apprehend key advisers to Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. During the assault, Super Six One, one of the Army&#x27;s Black Hawk helicopters providing insertion and air support to the assault team, was shot down and crashed in the city. A combat search and rescue team was dispatched to the first crash site to secure it and a short time later a second Black Hawk, Super Six Four, was shot down as well. Ranger forces on the ground were not able to assist the downed helicopter crew of the second crash site as they were already engaged in heavy combat with Aidid&#x27;s militia while making their way to the first crash site.

Gordon and his Delta Force sniper teammates Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart and Sergeant First Class Brad Halling, who were providing sniper cover from the air, wanted to be dropped at the second crash site in order to protect the four critically wounded crew, despite the fact that large numbers of armed, hostile combatants were converging on the area. Mission commanders denied Gordon&#x27;s request, saying that the situation was already too dangerous for the three Delta snipers to effectively protect the Black Hawk crew from the ground. Command&#x27;s position was that the snipers could be of more assistance by continuing to provide air cover. Gordon, however, concluded that there was no way the Black Hawk crew could survive on their own, and repeated his request twice until he finally received permission. Halling had assumed control of a minigun after a crew chief was injured and was not inserted with Shughart and Gordon.

Once on the ground, Gordon and Shughart, armed with only their personal weapons and sidearms, fought their way to the downed Black Hawk. By this time more Somali forces were arriving, intent on either capturing or killing the American servicemen. When they reached Super Six Four, Gordon and Shughart extracted the pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant, co-pilot Ray Frank, and crew chiefs Bill Cleveland and Tommy Field from the aircraft, and established defensive positions around the crash site. Despite having inflicted heavy casualties on their attackers, the two Delta snipers were outnumbered and outgunned. Their ammunition depleted, Gordon and Shughart were killed by Somali gunfire. It is believed that Gordon was the first to be killed. Shughart retrieved Gordon&#x27;s CAR-15 and gave it to Durant to use. Shortly afterwards, Shughart was killed and Durant was taken alive. Immediately after the battle, Mohammed&#x27;s troops counted 25 of their own men dead with many more severely wounded. According to &quot;America and Iraq: Policy-making, Intervention and Regional Politics&quot;, Gordon&#x27;s &quot;half-naked body was dragged horrifically through the streets of Mogadishu&quot;.

Gordon&#x27;s body was eventually recovered and is buried in Lincoln Cemetery, Penobscot County, Maine.

There was some confusion in the aftermath of the action as to the final moments of the firefight. The official citation states that Shughart had been killed first but Mark Bowden, author of &quot;Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War&quot;, a book about the October 1993 battle, relates an account by Sergeant Paul R. Howe, another Delta commando fighting in the battle. Howe said that he heard Shughart call for help on the radio. Furthermore, Durant believed that the weapon handed to him was not the distinctive M14 used by Shughart but a CAR-15; Howe said that Gordon would never have given his own weapon to another soldier to use while he was still able to fight. In Durant&#x27;s book, &quot;In the Company of Heroes&quot;, he states that Gordon was on the left side of the Black Hawk, after both he and Shughart moved Durant to a safer location, and only heard Gordon say, &quot;Damn, I&#x27;m hit.&quot; Durant acknowledged that he might have been wrong in his identification but was reluctant to push for the record to be changed since he was not sure.

After the terrorist attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, United States Special Forces units were inserted into Afghanistan to assist the Northern Alliance forces in overthrowing the Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorists. Following an intense mountain battle known as Operation Anaconda in March 2002, U.S. troops complex found a GPS unit and pouch labeled &quot;G. Gordon&quot;. Intelligence analysts believed at first this was Gordon&#x27;s GPS unit that he purchased on the private market and used in Somalia. The Gordon family was notified immediately of the find before the information was released to the public. It ultimately turned out that it was not Gordon&#x27;s GPS but one belonging to a helicopter pilot lost in an earlier fight during Operation Anaconda.

==Honors and awards==
MSG Gordon&#x27;s personal decorations include:

The U.S. Navy officially named a roll-on/roll-off ship in a ceremony at 10:00 a.m., Thursday, July 4, 1996, at Newport News, Virginia. Congressman John Murtha of Pennsylvania, was the ceremony&#x27;s principal speaker and Gordon&#x27;s widow, Carmen Gordon, served as the ship&#x27;s sponsor. &quot;Gordon&quot; was the second ship to undergo conversion from a commercial container vessel to a Large Medium Speed Roll On/Roll Off (LMSR) sealift ship and is operated by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Military Sealift Command, Washington, D.C.

Gordon has been honored elsewhere as well. Gordon Elementary School in Linden Oaks, Harnett County, North Carolina, which opened in January 2009, was named in his honor. The school is near Fort Bragg, where Gordon was stationed before being deployed to Somalia. In the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, LA, the main mock city is named Shughart-Gordon.

===Medal of Honor===

On May 23, 1994, both Gordon and Shughart posthumously received the Medal of Honor in recognition for the actions they took and the sacrifices they made to help protect the lives of the crew of Super Six Four. They were the only soldiers participating in Operation Gothic Serpent to receive the military&#x27;s highest honor, and the first Medal of Honor recipients since the Vietnam War. Their medals were presented to their widows Stephanie Shughart and Carmen Gordon by Bill Clinton in a ceremony at the White House.

===Medal of Honor citation===

==Namesakes==

Gary Ivan Gordon Elementary School in Fort Bragg.

==In culture==
In the 2001 film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, Gordon was portrayed by Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.

Marko Kloos’ novel, &quot;Lines of Departure&quot; (2014), centers around a space fleet containing the military freighter &quot;Gary I Gordon&quot; and Gordon&#x27;s heroic actions in Somalia are referenced.

<text>Randall David Shughart (August 13, 1958 – October 3, 1993) was a United States Army Delta Force operator who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Mogadishu, during Operation Gothic Serpent in October 1993.

==Early life==
Shughart was born August 13, 1958, in Lincoln, Nebraska. After his father, Herbert Shughart, left the Air Force, the Shugharts moved to Newville, Pennsylvania, to live and work on a dairy farm.

==Military career==
Shughart joined the United States Army while attending Big Spring High School in Newville, entering upon graduation in 1976. After completing basic training, he successfully completed infantry AIT (advanced individual training), Airborne School, and in 1978 was assigned to the 2nd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, at Fort Lewis, Washington. Several months later, he completed a pre-ranger course (formerly known as SURT, Small Unit Ranger Tactics), was granted a slot to attend Ranger School, graduated, and earned the Ranger Tab. Shughart left active duty and went into the Army Reserve in June 1980. In December 1983, Shughart returned to active duty and the following year attended Special Forces training. Shughart was assigned to Delta Force and was transferred to Fort Bragg, North Carolina in June 1986. As a Delta Force operator, he advanced to Assistant Team Sergeant.

Shughart was deployed to Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993 as part of Task Force Ranger. On October 3, 1993, during an assault mission to apprehend advisors to the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, a Black Hawk helicopter with the call sign &quot;Super Six-One&quot; was shot down in the city. A combat search and rescue (CSAR) team was sent in to secure the survivors. Then, a second Black Hawk helicopter, call sign &quot;Super Six-Four&quot;, was shot down.

Shughart, Gary Gordon, and Sergeant First Class Brad Halling had been providing sniper cover from the air from Black Hawk &quot;Super Six-Two&quot;. Gordon wanted to be inserted to secure the crash site as hostile Somalis were converging on the area.

Mission commanders denied Gordon&#x27;s request twice, saying that the situation was too dangerous for the snipers to protect the crew from the ground. Command&#x27;s position was that the snipers could be of more assistance by providing air cover. Gordon, however, repeated his request until he got permission. Halling stayed behind to man a door gun as one of the helicopter&#x27;s gunners had been wounded.

Armed with their sniper rifles and sidearms, Shughart and Gordon were inserted approximately from the crash site and made their way to the downed Black Hawk. Chief Warrant Officer Mike Durant was already defending the aircraft with an MP5 but was unable to move from his chair due to injuries sustained in the crash. When they reached &quot;Super Six-Four&quot;, they extracted Durant and the other crew from the helicopter and defended the aircraft. It is believed that Gordon was the first of the two to be killed by the surrounding mob. Shughart retrieved Gordon&#x27;s CAR-15 rifle and gave it to Durant to use. Shortly after, Shughart was killed, the site was overrun and Durant was taken hostage. According to Durant&#x27;s book &quot;In the Company of Heroes&quot;, the Somalis counted 25 of their militia dead after the firefight.

There was some confusion in the aftermath of the action as to who had been killed first. The official citation states that Shughart had been killed first but Mark Bowden, author of &quot;Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War&quot;, relates an account by Sergeant Paul Howe who heard Shughart call for help on the radio and noted that the weapon handed to Durant was not the distinctive M14 rifle that Shughart used. Howe said that Gordon would not have given his weapon to someone while he could still fight. Durant acknowledged that he might have been wrong in his identification but was reluctant to push for the record to be changed since he was not sure. Shughart&#x27;s body was eventually recovered and is buried in Westminster Cemetery, Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

==In popular culture==
In the 2001 film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, Shughart was portrayed by actor Johnny Strong.

==Awards and decorations==
SFC Shughart&#x27;s awards and decorations include:


=== Medal of Honor ===
On May 23, 1994, Shughart and Gordon were posthumously decorated with the Medal of Honor for protecting the crew of Super Six Four. They were the first Medal of Honor recipients since the Vietnam War.

Herbert Shughart, Randall Shughart&#x27;s father, attended the Medal of Honor presentation ceremony at the White House, where he refused to shake hands with U.S. President Bill Clinton. He then proceeded to openly criticize the president, telling him, &quot;You are not fit to be president of the United States. The blame for my son&#x27;s death rests with the White House and with you. You are not fit to command.&quot;


===USNS &quot;Shughart&quot;===

In 1997, the Navy named roll-on/roll-off ship in a ceremony at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, San Diego. The ceremony was attended by a number of officers and politicians including Shughart&#x27;s commanding officer at the time of his death; John W. Douglass, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition; Senator Bob Kerrey; and others. The ship was the first &quot;Large Medium Speed Roll On/Roll Off (LMSR) ship&quot; to undergo conversion from a commercial container vessel to a sealift cargo ship.

===Memorial Bridge===
The Pennsylvania Route 641 bridge over the Big Spring Creek (Pennsylvania) was dedicated May 30, 2024 as the SFC Randall Shughart Memorial Bridge.

<doc id="60154" wikidata="Q2449" url="?curid=60154" title="Mogadishu">
<text>Mogadishu, locally known as Xamar or Hamar, is the capital and most populous city of Somalia. The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.

Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a (federal state).

Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry. In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate. In the 19th century, it came under the Sultanate of the Geledi&#x27;s sphere of influence.

In 1894, the Somali chief signed a treaty of peace, friendship, and protection with Filonardi of the Commercial Company of Benadir. The onset of Italian colonial rule occurred in stages, with treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Commercial Company of Benadir, and then direct governance by the Italian Empire after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the Trust Territory of Somaliland administered by Italy in the 1950s.

This was followed by independence in 1960, the Somali Democratic Republic era during Siad Barre&#x27;s presidency (1969–1991). The three-decade long Somali Civil War afterwards devastated the city. As of the late 2010s and 2020s, a period of major reconstruction commenced.

==Etymology==
The origins of the name &quot;Mogadishu&quot; (Muqdisho) have many theories but it is most likely derived from a morphology of the Somali words &quot;Muuq&quot; and &quot;Disho&quot; which mean &quot;Sight Killer&quot; or &quot;Blinder&quot;, possibly referring to the city&#x27;s blinding beauty. Magh&#x27;ad-e shāh () is another phrase from which the name of Mogadishu is believed to be derived, meaning &quot;seat of the Shah/merchant Shah&quot; which reflects the city&#x27;s early Persian influence. The Arabic &quot;, meaning &quot;hallowed (place)&quot; may also be a root after establishment. The 16th century explorer Leo Africanus knew the city as &quot;Magadazo&quot; (alt. &quot;Magadoxo&quot;).

==History==
===Antiquity===

====Sarapion====
The ancient city of Sarapion is believed to have been the predecessor state of Mogadishu. It is mentioned in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, a Greek travel document dating from the first century AD, as one of a series of commercial ports on the Somali littoral. According to the &quot;Periplus&quot;, maritime trade already connected peoples in the Mogadishu area with other communities along the Indian Ocean.

During ancient times Mogadishu was part of the Somali city-states that engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemic Egypt, Greece, Parthian Persia, Sabaeans, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the &quot;beden&quot; to transport their cargo.

===Foundation and origins===
The founding ethnicity of Mogadishu and its subsequent sultanate has been a topic of intrigue in Somali Studies. Ioan Lewis and Enrico Cerulli believed that the city was founded and ruled by a council of Arab and Persian families. However, the reference I.M Lewis and Cerulli received traces back to one 19th century text called the Kitab Al-Zunuj, which has been discredited by modern scholars as unreliable and unhistorical. More importantly, it contradicts oral, ancient written sources and archaeological evidence on the pre-existing civilizations and communities that flourished on the Somali coast, and to which were the forefathers of Mogadishu and other coastal cities. Thus, the Persian and Arab founding &quot;myths&quot; are regarded as an outdated false colonialist reflection on Africans ability to create their own sophisticated states. It has now been widely accepted that there were already communities on the Somali coast with ethnic Somali leadership, to whom the Arab and Persian families had to ask for permission to settle in their cities. It also seems the local Somalis retained their political and numerical superiority on the coast while the Muslim immigrants would go through an assimilation process by adopting the local language and culture.

Mogadishu along with Zeila and other Somali coastal cities was founded upon an indigenous network involving hinterland trade and that happened even before significant Arab migrations or trade with the Somali coast. That goes back approximately four thousand years and are supported by archaeological and textual evidences.

This is corroborated by the first century AD Greek document the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, detailing multiple prosperous port cities in ancient Somalia, as well as the identification of ancient Sarapion with the city that would later be known as Mogadishu. When Ibn Battuta visited the Sultanate in the 14th century, he identified the Sultan as being of Barbara origin, an ancient term to describe the ancestors of the Somali people. According to Ross E. Dunn neither Mogadishu, or any other city on the coast could be considered alien enclaves of Arabs or Persians, but were in-fact African towns.

Yaqut al-Hamawi, a Muslim medieval geographer in the year 1220 describes Mogadishu as the most prominent town on the coast. Yaqut also mentioned Mogadishu as being a town inhabited by Berbers, described as &quot;dark-skinned&quot; and considered ancestors of modern Somalis. By the thirteenth century, Ibn Sa&#x27;id described Mogadishu, Merca and Barawa located in the Benadir coast had become Islamic and commercial centers in the Indian Ocean. He said the local people in the Benadir coast and the interior were predominantly inhabited by Somalis with a minority of Arab, Persian and Indian merchants living in the coastal towns. Ibn al-Mujawir mentions the Banu Majid who fled the Mundhiriya region in Yemen in the year 1159 and settled in Mogadishu and also traders from the port towns of Abyan and Haram.

Mogadishu is traditionally inhabited by four clans. These are the Moorshe, Iskashato, DhabarWeyne, and the Bandawow. Moorshe is regarded the oldest group in Mogadishu and is considered to be a sub-clan of Ajuran who established one of the most powerful medieval kingdoms in Africa, the Ajuran Sultanate. The Gibil Madow (Dark Skins) faction of the Benadiri are said to hail from the Somali clan groups from inland which make up the majority of Benadiris with a small minority being Gibil Cads (Light Skins) which descend from Muslim immigrants.

=== Medieval Period ===
====Mogadishu Sultanate====

The Mogadishu Sultanate was a medieval Somali sultanate centered in southern Somalia. It rose as one of the pre-eminent powers in the Horn of Africa under the rule of Fakhr ad-Din before becoming part of the expanding Ajuran Empire in the 13th century. The Mogadishu Sultanate maintained a vast trading network, dominated the regional gold trade, minted its own currency, and left an extensive architectural legacy in present-day southern Somalia. A local city-state with much influence over the hinterland neighbouring coastal towns.
For many years Mogadishu functioned as the pre-eminent city in the (&quot;Bilad al Barbar&quot; – &quot;Land of the Berbers&quot;), as medieval Arabic-speakers named the Somali coast. Following his visit to the city, the 12th-century Syrian historian Yaqut al-Hamawi (a former slave of Greek origin) wrote a global history of many places he visited Mogadishu and called it the richest and most powerful city in the region and was an Islamic center across the Indian Ocean.

====Medieval Mogadishu====
During his travels, ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Maghribi (1213–1286) noted that Mogadishu city had already become the leading Islamic centre in the region. By the time of the Tangier-born traveller ibn Battuta&#x27;s appearance on the coastline of Somalia in 1331, the city was at the zenith of its prosperity. He described Mogadishu as &quot;an exceedingly large city&quot; with many rich merchants, which was famous for its high quality fabric that it exported to Mamluk Sultanate-ruled Egypt, among other places. He also describes the hospitality of the people of Mogadishu and how locals would put travellers up in their home to help the local economy. Battuta added that the city was ruled by a Somali sultan, Abu Bakr ibn Shaikh &#x27;Umar, He noted that Sultan Abu Bakr had dark skin complexion and spoke in his native tongue (Somali) but was also fluent in Arabic. The Sultan also had a retinue of viziers, legal experts, commanders, royal eunuchs, and other officials at his beck and call. Ibn Khaldun (1332 to 1406) noted in his book that Mogadishu was a massive metropolis. He also claimed that the city was very populous with many wealthy merchants.

This period gave birth to notable figures like Abd al-Aziz of Mogadishu who was described as the governor and island chief of Maldives by ibn Battuta. After him is named the Abdul-Aziz Mosque of Mogadishu, which survived for centuries.

The island&#x27;s appellation &quot;Madagascar&quot; is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the Middle Ages by Europeans. The name &quot;Madageiscar&quot; was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer Marco Polo as a corrupted transliteration of the name Mogadishu, the famous port with which Polo had confused the island.

Vasco da Gama, who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century, noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and large palaces in its centre and many mosques with cylindrical minarets. In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa noted that many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya sailed to Mogadishu with cloths and spices for which they in return received gold, wax and ivory. Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat, wheat, barley, horses, and fruit on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants. Mogadishu, the center of a thriving weaving industry known as &quot;toob benadir&quot; (specialized for the markets in Egypt and Syria), together with Merca and Barawa also served as transit stops for Swahili merchants from Mombasa and Malindi and for the gold trade from Kilwa. Jewish merchants from Ormus also brought their Indian textile and fruit to the Somali coast in exchange for grain and wood.

Duarte Barbosa, the famous Portuguese traveller, wrote about Mogadishu (c 1517–1518):

In 1542, the Portuguese commander João de Sepúvelda led a small fleet on an expedition to the Somali coast. During this expedition, he briefly attacked Mogadishu, capturing an Ottoman ship and firing upon the city, which compelled the sultan of Mogadishu to sign a peace treaty with the Portuguese.

According to the 16th-century explorer, Leo Africanus indicates that the native inhabitants of the Mogadishu polity were of the same origins as the denizens of the northern people of Zeila the capital of Adal Sultanate. They were generally tall with an olive skin complexion, some darker. They would wear traditional rich white silk wrapped around their bodies and have Islamic turbans, and coastal people only wore sarongs and wrote in Arabic as a lingua franca. Their weaponry consisted of traditional Somali weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, battle axe, and bow and arrows. However, they received assistance from its close ally, the Ottoman Empire, and with the import of firearms such as muskets and cannons. Most were Muslims, although a few adhered to pre-Islamic beliefs; there were also some Orthodox Tewahedo Christians further inland. Mogadishu itself was a wealthy, and well-built city-state, which maintained commercial trade with kingdoms across the world. The metropolis city was surrounded by walled stone fortifications.

The Ajuran Sultanate collapsed in the 17th century due to heavy taxation against their subjects, which started a rebellion. The ex-subjects became a new wave of Somali migrants, the Abgaal, moved both into the Shebelle River basin and Mogadishu. A new political elite led by Abgaal Yaquub imams, with ties to the new leaders in the interior, moved into the Shangani District of the city. Remnants of the Ajuran lived in the other key-quarters of Hamar Weyne District. Ajuran merchants began to look for new linkages and regional trade opportunities since the Abgaal had commandeered the existing trading networks.

===Early Modern period (1700s–1900s)===
==== Hiraab Imamate ====
By the 17th century, the Hiraab Imamate was a powerful kingdom that ruled large parts of southern and central Somalia. It successfully revolted against the Ajuran Sultanate and established an independent rule for at least two centuries from the seventeen hundreds and onwards.

By the late 19th century, the Imamate began to decline due to internal problems, the Imamate also faced challenges from Imperialist kingdoms, the Zanzibari Sultan from the coast and Geledi Sultanate, and Hobyo Sultanate from the interior from both directions.

==== Geledi Sultanate ====

The Sultanate of Geledi and the Omani Empire vied over who would be the superior power on the Benadir Coast, with Sultan Yusuf Mahamud ultimately being the dominant force with the Omanis having a nominal presence and Said bin Sultan even paying tribute to him in order to keep Omani representatives in Mogadishu. Mogadishu under Abgaal control had been in a period of decline and disarray near the end of the Hiraab Imamate. Following a struggle between the two leading figures of each respective quarter (Shingani and Hamarweyn) Sultan Yusuf marched into the city with an 8,000 strong army and ruled in favour of the Shingani leader, with the loser fleeing the city. Yusuf would nominate a relative of the deposed chief to lead the Hamarweyn quarter ending the dispute. Sultan Yusuf is even referred to as the governor of Mogadishu in some sources, highlighting the power he exerted over the city.

Despite the Somali political decline, trade with Geledi Sultanate flourished during Geledi Sultan Ahmed Yusuf&#x27;s reign. British explorer John Kirk visited the region in 1873 and noted a variety of things. Roughly 20 large dhows were docked in both Mogadishu and Merka filled with grain produced from the farms of the Geledi in the interior. Kirk met the Imam Mahmood who reigned over Mogadishu. The Shabelle river itself was referred to as the &#x27;Geledi river&#x27; by Kirk, perhaps in respect of the volume of produce that the Sultanate output. In Barawa there was little grain instead a large quantity of ivory and skins which had already been loaded onto ships destined for Zanzibar.

The Geledi Sultans were at the height of their power. They dominated the East African ivory trade, and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the hinterland. The Omani Sultans&#x27; authority in Mogadishu, however, was largely nominal (existing by name only). When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city, he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf the real power broker who in turn convinced the Hiraab Imam to acquiesce to the decision. Omani and later Zanzibari officials were mere representatives of the Sultan to collect customs and needed the fort for their own security rather than control of the city. The Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in 1870. The Sultan of Zanzibar later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians, but not the land itself, which was Somali owned.

===Italian Somaliland (late 1800s–1960)===

In 1905, Italy made Mogadishu the capital of the newly established Italian Somaliland. The Italians subsequently spelled the name of the city as &quot;Mogadiscio&quot;. After World War I, the surrounding territory came under Italian control with some resistance.

Thousands of Italians and other people from the Italian empire began to settle in Mogadishu and founded small manufacturing companies across Somalia. They also developed some agricultural areas in the south near the capital, such as Janale and the &quot;Villaggio duca degli Abruzzi&quot; (present-day Jowhar). In the 1930s, new buildings and avenues were built. A narrow-gauge railway was laid from Mogadishu to Jowhar. An asphalt road, the &quot;Strada Imperiale&quot;, was also constructed and intended to link Mogadishu to Addis Ababa.

In 1940, the Italo-Somali population numbered 22,000, accounting for over 44% of the city&#x27;s population of 50,000 residents. Mogadishu remained the capital of Italian Somaliland throughout the latter polity&#x27;s existence. In World War II it was captured by British forces in February 1941.

After World War II Mogadishu was made the capital of the Trust Territory of Somaliland, an Italian administered fiduciary political entity under the UNO mandate, for ten years (1950–1960).
===Somali Republic (1960–1991)===
British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, and the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later. On 1 July 1960, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic, with Mogadishu serving as the nation&#x27;s capital. A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa and other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President of the Somali Republic, and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister (later to become president from 1967 to 1969). On 20 July 1961 and through a popular referendum, the people of Somalia ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960. In 1967, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke.

On 15 October 1969, while paying a visit to the northern town of Las Anod, Somalia&#x27;s then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d&#x27;état on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.

Alongside Barre, the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke&#x27;s assassination was led by Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Ali Korshel. Kediye officially held the title of &quot;Father of the Revolution,&quot; and Barre shortly afterwards became the head of the SRC. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic, arrested members of the former civilian government, banned political parties, dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution.

The revolutionary army established large-scale public works programmes, including the Mogadishu Stadium. In addition to a nationalization programme of industry and land, the Mogadishu-based new regime&#x27;s foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia&#x27;s traditional and religious links with the Arab world, eventually joining the Arab League in 1974.

After fallout from the unsuccessful Ogaden campaign of the late 1970s, the Barre administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion of participation in the 1978 coup d&#x27;état attempt. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials escaped abroad and started to form dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre&#x27;s regime by force.

===Civil war===
By the late 1980s, Barre&#x27;s regime had become increasingly unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia&#x27;s communist Derg administration, sprang up across the country. Mogadishu saw its first major outbreak of violence during the 14 July 1989 riots, during the crackdown Barres forces killed approximately 400 civilians.&quot;&quot; The July 1989 riots resulted in a large exodus of foreigners from the city and intensification of opposition towards the regime. This incident and other events over the following months led to the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, the toppling of Barre&#x27;s government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre&#x27;s regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.
During the United Nations Operation in Somalia II several gun battles took place in Mogadishu between Somali factions, volunteers and peacekeepers. Among these was the Battle of Mogadishu of 1993, a US apprehension of two high-ranking lieutenants of the Somali National Alliance. The UN soldiers withdrew altogether from the country on 3 March 1995, having incurred more significant casualties.

In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist organization, assumed control of much of the southern part of the country and imposed sharia law. The new Transitional Federal Government (TFG), established two years earlier, sought to establish its authority. With the assistance of Ethiopian troops, AMISOM peacekeepers and air support by the United States, it drove out the rival ICU and solidified its rule. On 8 January 2007, as the Battle of Ras Kamboni, raged, TFG President and founder Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former colonel in the Somali Army, entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to office. The government then relocated to Villa Somalia in Mogadishu from its interim location in Baidoa, marking the first time since the fall of the Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.

Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into factions. Some of the more radical elements, including a youth milita within the courts military wing known as al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military&#x27;s presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government&#x27;s troops.

Between 31 May and 9 June 2008, representatives of Somalia&#x27;s federal government and the moderate Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) group of Islamist rebels participated in peace talks in Djibouti brokered by the UN. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected a new president. With the help of a small team of African Union troops, the coalition government also began a counteroffensive in February 2009 to retake control of the southern half of the country. To solidify its control of southern Somalia, the TFG formed an alliance with the Islamic Courts Union, other members of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and Ahlu Sunna Waljama&#x27;a, a moderate Sufi militia.

In November 2010, a new technocratic government was elected to office, which enacted numerous reforms, especially in the security sector. By August 2011, the new administration and its AMISOM allies had managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction spearheaded by the Somali diaspora, the municipal authorities, and Turkey, a historic ally of Somalia.

In October 2017, over 500 people were killed by a truck bombing.

In March 2022, al-Shabaab killed over 60 people in a series of attacks.

In October 2022, an al-Shabaab double car bombing killed over 120 people.
On 14 March, militants attacked and sieged the SYL Hotel in Mogadishu.

In July 2024, At least eight people are killed and twenty-one others injured in a shootout between security forces and inmates in a Mogadishu prison during an escape attempt. The prisoners who attempted to escape were members of Al-Shabaab. On 14 July, 10 people were injured in a cafe due to a car bombing done by Al-Shabaab.

In August 2024, 37 people were killed by an Al-Shabaab suicide bomber at Lido Beach.

===Reconstruction===

In August 2011, militant group al Shabaab made a strategic withdrawal from Mogadishu to return to hit-and-run tactics. Mayor Mohamed Nur recognized the opportunity as critical to stabilizing and rebuilding the city. Working closely with the UN, USAID, and DRC, Nur&#x27;s administration started large-scale rehabilitation of roads and general infrastructure, with residents cooperating with the civil and police authorities to tighten up on security. Nur recognized the opportunity to transform Mogadishu although resources were limited. Working with urban strategist Mitchell Sipus, the Benadir government sought to design and deploy a data-driven approach to post-war reconstruction.

With the passing of a new Constitution in 2012 and the subsequent election of an inaugural President in the new Federal Government, the mayorship continued to oversee Mogadishu&#x27;s ongoing post-conflict reconstruction. Building off the initial pilot, the Benadir administration launched a citywide street naming, house numbering and postal codes project. Officially called the House Numbering and Post Code System, it is a joint initiative of the municipal authorities and Somali business community representatives. According to Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership disputes. , there are postal codes for 156 localities and sub-localities, including the Mogadishu metropolitan area.

The Government of Somalia has its seat in Mogadishu, the nation&#x27;s capital. The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the internationally recognized central government of Somalia between 2004 and 2012. Based in Mogadishu, it constituted the executive branch of government.

The Federal Government of Somalia was established on 20 August 2012 at the end of the TFG&#x27;s interim mandate. It represented the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war. The Federal Parliament of Somalia serves as the government&#x27;s legislative branch.

===Municipal===

Mogadishu&#x27;s municipal government is led by Omar Mohamud Mohamed (Finnish), who succeeded the late mayor Abdirahman Omar Osman (Yariisow) in August 2019 after Osman was killed in a suicide bomb attack that targeted his office.

Among the administration&#x27;s development initiatives are a US$100 million urban renewal project, the creation of garbage disposal and incineration plants, the launch of a citywide cleanup project, the creation of asphalt and cement plants, rehabilitation of the Town Hall and parliament buildings, reconstruction of the former Defence Ministry offices, reconstruction of correctional facilities, rehabilitation and construction of health facilities, establishment of a Police Training Center and a permanent base in Jasiira for the new Somali Armed Forces, rebuilding of the Somali Postal Service headquarters, and rehabilitation of public playgrounds in several districts.

In addition, the municipal authorities started renovating important local government centers in September 2014, including the capital&#x27;s former Fisho Guverno compound. In January 2015, the Benadir administration also opened a new Health &amp; Safety Office to supervise health and safety practices in the city, and launched a municipal beautification campaign ahead of various international conferences that are slated to be held there.

In March 2015, the Benadir administration completed the SECIL project in conjunction with the EU and UN–Habitat.

He indicated that although there was no set timetable for the premises&#x27; relaunch, the US government had immediately begun upgrading its diplomatic representation in the country. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke also presented to Kerry the real estate deed for land reserved for the new US embassy compound. Mohamud concurrently signed an Establishment Agreement with the EU Head of Delegation in Somalia Michele Cervone d’Urso, which facilitates the opening of more embassies in Mogadishu by European Union member states.

In February 2014, Somalia&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Abdirahman Duale Beyle announced that the federal government was slated to reopen the former Institute of Diplomacy in Mogadishu. The centre historically served as one of the most important national institutions for diplomacy and international relations. Beyle also pledged to reestablish the institute&#x27;s diplomacy department, its information and broadcasting department, as well as its library.

==Economy==

Mogadishu traditionally served as a commercial and financial centre. Before the importation of mass-produced cloth from Europe and America, the city&#x27;s textiles were forwarded throughout the interior of the continent, as well as to the Arabian Peninsula and as far as the Persian coast.

Mogadishu&#x27;s economy has grown rapidly since the city&#x27;s pacification in mid-2011. The SomalFruit processing factory was reopened once again, as well as the local Coca-Cola factory, which was also refurbished. In May 2012, the First Somali Bank was established in the capital, representing the first commercial bank to open in southern Somalia since 1991. The Somali civil engineer and entrepreneur Nasra Agil opened the city&#x27;s first Dollar store. The Historic Central Bank was regenerated, with the Moumin Business Centre likewise under construction.

The galvanization of Mogadishu&#x27;s real estate sector was in part facilitated by the establishment of a local construction yard in November 2012 by the Municipality of Istanbul and the Turkish Red Crescent. 50 construction trucks and machines were imported from Turkey. The yard produces concrete, asphalt and paving stones for building projects and entrepreneurs. The Istanbul Municipality was also scheduled to bring in 100 specialists to accelerate the construction initiative which ultimately aims to modernize the capital&#x27;s infrastructure.

In mid-2012, Mogadishu held its first ever Technology, Entertainment, Design (TEDx) conference. The event was organized by the FirstSomali Bank to showcase improvements in business, development and security to potential Somali and international investors. A second consecutive TEDx entrepreneurial conference was held the following year in the capital, highlighting new enterprises and commercial opportunities, including the establishment of the city&#x27;s first dry cleaning business in several years.
A number of large firms have their headquarters in Mogadishu. Among these is the Trans-National Industrial Electricity and Gas Company, an energy conglomerate founded in 2010 that unites five major Somali companies from the trade, finance, security and telecommunications sectors.

==Demographics==
Mogadishu is inhabited by All Somali clan-families, with the most dominated being the Abgaal and Murusade clans. Apart from the Somalis that have inhabited the city since the beginning, several minorities have also historically lived in the city. With the beginning of Islam, Arab and Persian migrants began to settle during the medieval period. Centuries of intermarriage between the various ethnic groups, which also include Bantus, produced a minority people called Benadiris, or ‘Ad’ad (), who mainly inhabit the oldest districts of Mogadishu. In the colonial period, European expatriates, primarily Italians, would also contribute to the city&#x27;s cosmopolitan populace.

Following a greatly improved security situation in the city in 2012, Somali expatriates and many of the diaspora began returning to Mogadishu for investment opportunities and to take part in the post-conflict reconstruction. Through both private efforts and public initiatives like the Somali Diaspora Corps, they have participated in the renovation of schools, hospitals, banks and other infrastructure. They have also helped to propel the local real estate market. Since 2015, Mogadishu and many parts of the north of the country have seen a rise in refugees and migrants mainly those who are returning from Yemen or are from war torn Arab countries particularly those who are Yemenis and Syrians who are fleeing conflict.

==Landmarks==

===Places of worship===

Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.

Arba&#x27;a Rukun Mosque is one of the oldest Islamic places of worship in the capital. It was built circa 667 (1268–9 AD) along with the Fakr ad-Din Mosque. Arba&#x27;a Rukun&#x27;s mihrab contains an inscription dated from the same year, which commemorates the masjid&#x27;s late founder, Khusra ibn Mubarak al-Shirazi (Khusrau ibn Muhammed).

The Mosque of Islamic Solidarity was constructed in 1987 with financial support from the Saudi Fahd bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud Foundation. It is the main mosque in the city, and an iconic building in Somali society. With a capacity of up to 10,000 worshippers, it is the single largest masjid in the Horn region. In 2015, the federal authorities completed formal refurbishments on the mosque&#x27;s infrastructure. The upgrades are part of a larger governmental renovation campaign aimed at all of the masjids in Mogadishu. To this end, the municipal authority is refurbishing the historic Central Mosque, situated downtown.

The Mogadishu Cathedral was built in 1928 by the colonial authorities in Italian Somaliland. Known as the &quot;Cattedrale di Mogadiscio&quot;, it was constructed in a Norman Gothic style, based on the Cefalù Cathedral in Cefalù, Sicily. The church served as the traditional seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio. It later incurred significant damage during the civil war. In April 2013, after a visit to the site to inspect its condition, the Diocese of Mogadiscio announced plans to refurbish the building.

===Palaces===

As of January 2014, it holds many culturally important artefacts, including old coins, bartering tools, traditional artwork, ancient weaponry and pottery items.

The National Library of Somalia was established in 1975, and came under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Higher Education. In 1983, it held approximately 7,000 books, little in the way of historical and cultural archival material, and was open to the general public. The National Library later closed down in the 1990s. In June 2013, the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies organized a shipment of 22,000 books from the United States to Somalia as part of an initiative to restock the library. In December of the year, the Somali authorities officially launched a major project to rebuild the National Library. With Zainab Hassan serving as Director, the $1 million federal government-funded initiative will see a new library complex built in the capital within six months. In preparation for the relaunch, 60,000 additional books from other Arab League states are expected to arrive.

The National Theatre of Somalia opened in 1967 as an important cultural landmark in the national capital. It closed down after the start of the civil war in the early 1990s but reopened in March 2012 after reconstruction. In September 2013, the Somali federal government and its Chinese counterpart signed an official cooperation agreement in Mogadishu as part of a five-year national recovery plan in Somalia. The pact will see the Chinese authorities reconstruct the National Theatre of Somalia in addition to several other major infrastructural landmarks. A large part of Somalia&#x27;s rich history remains at risk of disappearance with the lack of proper storage and archival system. At Radio Mogadishu, for example, over 200,000 tapes of records are dumped in a storeroom. If these analogue tapes are not digitized, they could be damaged to the point when it is impossible to recover them.

===Markets===

Bakaara Market was created in late 1972 by the Barre administration. It served as an open market for the sale of goods and services, including produce and clothing. After the start of the civil war, the market was controlled by militant groups, who used it as a base for their operations. Following Mogadishu&#x27;s pacification in 2011, renovations resumed at the market. Shops were rehabilitated, selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials. As in the rest of the city, Barkaara Market&#x27;s real estate values have also risen considerably. , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse at the market for $2,000 per month.

In February 2014, the Benadir administration began renovations at the Ansaloti Market in the Hamar Jajab district. It was one of the largest markets in the city before closing down operations in the early 1990s. In September 2014, the municipal authorities reopened the Ansaloti to the public, with officials supervising all parts of the market. According to the Benadir Political Affairs Vice Chairman Mohamed Adan &quot;Anagel&quot;, the facility is now open for business and will compete with other regional markets.

The Regional Somali Language Academy is an intergovernmental regulating body for the Somali language in the Horn region. In January 2015, President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud announced that the institute was slated to be finalized in conjunction with the governments of Djibouti and Ethiopia. Among the scheduled projects was the construction of a new headquarters for the academy in Mogadishu, in recognition of Somalia&#x27;s traditional position as the centre for the development and promotion of the Somali language. In February 2015, the foundation stone for the new Regional Somali Language Academy was officially laid at an inauguration ceremony in the city.

To meet the growing demand, hotel representatives have also begun participating in international industry conferences, such as the Africa Hotel Investment Forum.

Among the new hotels is the six-floor Jazeera Palace Hotel. It was built in 2010 and opened in 2012. Situated within 300m of the Aden Adde International Airport, it has a 70-room capacity with a 70% occupancy rate.

In October 2013, major construction began on the 23-kilometer road leading to the airport. Overseen by Somali and Turkish engineers, the upgrade was completed in November and included lane demarcation. The road construction initiative was part of a larger agreement signed by the Somali and Turkish governments to establish Mogadishu and Istanbul as sister cities, and in the process bring all of Mogadishu&#x27;s roads up to modern standards. Following the treaty, the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA) launched a citywide cleaning project in conjunction with the municipal cleaning department. The initiative saw around 100 rubbish collection vehicles and other equipment operated by TIKA clean the city&#x27;s roads, with the Benadir municipality taking over operation of the cleaning project in March 2015.

In 2012–2013, Mogadishu&#x27;s municipal authority in conjunction with the British and Norwegian governments began a project to install solar-powered street lights on all of the capital&#x27;s major roads. With equipment imported from Norway, the initiative cost around $140,000 and lasted several months. The solar panels have helped to improve night-time visibility and enhance the city&#x27;s overall aesthetic appeal.

Minibuses are the most common type of public transportation in Mogadishu. The next most frequently used public vehicles in the city are auto rickshaws (&quot;bajaj&quot;). They number around 3,000 units and come in various designs. The auto-rickshaws represent a lower cost alternative to taxis and minibuses, typically charging half the price for the same distance, with flexible rates. Due to their affordability, capacity to negotiate narrow lanes and low fuel consumption, the three-wheeled vehicles are often appealing investment opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs. They are generally preferred for shorter commutes. In June 2013, two new taxi companies also started offering road transportation to residents. Part of a fleet of over 100 vehicles, Mogadishu Taxi&#x27;s trademark yellow cabs offer rides throughout the city at flat rates of $5. City Taxi, the firm&#x27;s nearest competitor, charges the same flat rate, with plans to add new cabs to its fleet.

In January 2014, the Benadir administration launched a citywide street naming, house numbering and postal codes project. Officially called the House Numbering and Post Code System, it is a joint initiative of the municipal authorities and Somali business community representatives. According to former Mayor Mohamed Ahmed Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership disputes. In March 2015, the Benadir administration likewise launched a renovation project on the Hawo Asir-Fagah major road in Mogadishu. The government-public partnership aims to facilitate vehicle access in the area. According to Karaan district commissioner Ahmed Hassan Yalah&#x27;ow, the reconstruction initiative will also make the road all-weather resistant and is slated to be completed shortly.

===Air===
During the post-independence period, Mogadishu International Airport offered flights to numerous global destinations. In the mid-1960s, the airport was enlarged to accommodate more international carriers, with the state-owned Somali Airlines providing regular trips to many major cities. By 1969, the airport&#x27;s many landing grounds could also host small jets and DC 6B-type aircraft.

The facility grew considerably in size in the post-independence period after successive renovation projects. With the outbreak of the civil war in the early 1990s, Mogadishu International Airport&#x27;s flight services experienced routine disruptions and its grounds and equipment were largely destroyed. In the late 2000s, the K50 Airport, situated 50 kilometers to the south, served as the capital&#x27;s main airport while Mogadishu International Airport, now renamed Aden Adde International Airport, briefly shut down. However, in late 2010, the security situation in Mogadishu had significantly improved, with the federal government eventually managing to assume full control of the city by August 2011.

In May 2011, the Ministry of Transport announced that SKA-Somalia had been contracted to manage operations at the re-opened Aden Adde International Airport over a period of ten years. Among its first initiatives, worth an estimated $6 million, SKA invested in new airport equipment and expanded support services by hiring, training and equipping 200 local workers to meet international airport standards. The company also assisted in comprehensive infrastructure renovations, restored a dependable supply of electricity, revamped the baggage handling facilities as well as the arrival and departure lounges, put into place electronic check-in systems, and firmed up on security and work-flow. Additionally, SKA connected the grounds&#x27; Somali Civil Aviation and Meteorological Agency (SCAMA) and immigration, customs, commercial airlines and Somali Police Force officials to the internet. By January 2013, the firm had introduced shuttle buses to ferry travelers to and from the passenger terminal.

In December 2011, the Turkish government unveiled plans to further modernize the airport as part of Turkey&#x27;s broader engagement in the local post-conflict reconstruction process. Among the scheduled renovations were new systems and infrastructure, including a modern control tower to monitor the airspace. In September 2013, the Turkish company Favori LLC began operations at the airport. The firm announced plans to renovate the aviation building and construct a new one, as well as upgrade other modern service structures. A $10 million project, it will increase the airport&#x27;s existing 15 aircraft capacity to 60. In January 2015, a new, state-of-the-art terminal was opened at the airport. Featuring modern passenger facilities and a glass façade, it will enable the airport to double its number of daily commercial flights to 60, with a throughput of around 1,000 passengers per hour.

As of January 2015, the largest airline services using Aden Adde International Airport include the Somali-owned private carriers Jubba Airways, Daallo Airlines, and African Express Airways, in addition to UN charter planes, Turkish Airlines, The airport also offers flights to other cities in Somalia, such as Galkayo, Berbera and Hargeisa, as well as to international destinations like Djibouti, Jeddah, and Istanbul.

In July 2012, Mohammed Osman Ali (Dhagah-tur), the General Director of the Ministry of Aviation and Transport, also announced that the Somali government had begun preparations to revive the Mogadishu-based national carrier, Somali Airlines. The first new aircraft were scheduled for delivery in December 2013.

===Sea===

The Port of Mogadishu, also known as the Mogadishu International Port, is the official seaport of Mogadishu. Classified as a major class port, it is the largest harbour in the country.

After incurring some damage during the civil war, the federal government launched the Mogadishu Port Rehabilitation Project, an initiative to rebuild, develop and modernize the port. The renovations included the installation of Alpha Logistics technology. A joint international delegation consisting of the Director of the Port of Djibouti and Chinese officials specializing in infrastructure reconstruction visited the facility in June 2013. According to Mogadishu Port manager Abdullahi Ali Nur, the delegates along with local Somali officials received reports on the port&#x27;s functions as part of the rebuilding project&#x27;s planning stages.

In 2013, the Port of Mogadishu&#x27;s management reportedly reached an agreement with representatives of the Iranian company Simatech Shipping LLC to handle vital operations at the seaport. Under the name Mogadishu Port Container Terminal, the firm is slated to handle all of the port&#x27;s technical and operational functions.

In October 2013, the federal Cabinet endorsed an agreement with the Turkish firm Al-Bayrak to manage the Port of Mogadishu for a 20-year period. The deal was secured by the Ministry of Ports and Public Works, and also assigns Al-Bayrak responsibility for rebuilding and modernizing the seaport. In September 2014, the federal government officially delegated management of the Mogadishu Port to Al-Bayrak. The firm&#x27;s modernization project will cost $80 million.

===Railway===
There were projects during the 1980s to reactivate the railway between Mogadishu and Jowhar, built by the Italians in 1926 but dismantled in World War II by British troops. It was originally intended that this railway would reach Addis Ababa. Only a few remaining tracks inside Mogadishu&#x27;s harbour area are still used.

==Media==

Mogadishu has historically served as a media hub. In 1975, the Somali Film Agency (SFA), the nation&#x27;s film regulatory body, was established in Mogadishu. The SFA also organized the annual Mogadishu Pan-African and Arab Film Symposium (Mogpaafis), which brought together an array of filmmakers and movie experts from across the globe, including other parts of Northeast Africa and the Arab world, as well as Asia and Europe.

In addition, there are a number of radio news agencies based in Mogadishu. Radio Mogadishu is the federal government-run public broadcaster. Established in 1951 in Italian Somaliland, it initially aired news items in both Somali and Italian. The station was modernized with Russian assistance following independence in 1960, and began offering home service in Somali, Amharic and Oromo. After closing down operations in the early 1990s due to the civil war, the broadcaster was officially re-opened in the early 2000s by the Transitional National Government. Other radio stations headquartered in the city include Mustaqbal Radio, Radio Shabelle, Radio Bar-Kulan, Radio Kulmiye, Radio Dannan, Radio Dalsan, Radio Banadir, Radio Maanta, Gool FM, Radio Xurmo, and Radio Xamar, also known as Voice of Democracy.

The Mogadishu-based Somali National Television (SNTV) is the central government-owned broadcaster. On 4 April 2011, the Ministry of Information of the Transitional Federal Government officially re-launched the station as part of an initiative to develop the national telecommunications sector. SNTV broadcasts 24 hours a day, and can be viewed both within Somalia and abroad via terrestrial and satellite platforms.

Somali popular music enjoys a large audience in Mogadishu, and was widely sold prior to the civil war. With the government managing to secure the city in mid-2011, radios once again play music. On 19 March 2012, an open concert was held in the city, which was broadcast live on local television. In April 2013, the Waayaha Cusub ensemble also organized the Reconciliation Music Festival, the first international music festival to be held in Mogadishu in two decades. Mogadiscio also includes the headquarters of &quot;Bilan Media&quot;, a Somali newspaper composed exclusively of women, founded in 2020 with the support of the United Nations Development Programme.

<text>She Done Him Wrong is a 1933 pre-Code American crime/comedy film starring Mae West and Cary Grant, directed by Lowell Sherman. The plot includes melodramatic and musical elements, with a supporting cast featuring Owen Moore, Gilbert Roland, Noah Beery Sr., Rochelle Hudson, and Louise Beavers. The film was adapted from the successful 1928 Broadway play &quot;Diamond Lil&quot; by Mae West. The film is famous for West&#x27;s many double entendres and quips, including her best-known &quot;Why don&#x27;t you come up sometime and see me?&quot;. &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; was a box-office success and the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In 1996, &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
The story is set in New York City in the 1890s. A bawdy singer, Lady Lou, works in the Bowery barroom saloon of her boss and benefactor, Gus Jordan, who has given her many diamonds. But Lou is a lady with more men friends than anyone might imagine.

What she does not know is that Gus traffics in prostitution and runs a counterfeiting ring to help finance her expensive diamonds. He also sends young women to San Francisco to be pickpockets. Gus works with two other crooked entertainer-assistants, Russian Rita and Rita&#x27;s lover, the suave Sergei Stanieff. One of Gus&#x27;s rivals and former &quot;friend&quot; of Lou&#x27;s, named Dan Flynn, spends most of the movie dropping hints to Lou that Gus is up to no good, promising to look after her once Gus is in jail. Lou leads him on, hinting at times that she will return to him, but eventually he loses patience and implies he&#x27;ll see her jailed if she doesn&#x27;t submit to him.

A city mission is located next door to the bar. Its young director, Captain Cummings, is in reality an undercover federal agent working to infiltrate and expose the illegal activities in the bar. Gus suspects nothing; he worries only that Cummings will reform his bar and scare away his customers.

Lou&#x27;s former boyfriend, Chick Clark, is a vicious criminal who was convicted of robbery and sent to prison for trying to steal diamonds for her. In his absence, she becomes attracted to the handsome young psalm-singing reformer.

Warned that Chick thinks she&#x27;s betrayed him, she goes to the prison to try to reassure him. All the inmates greet her warmly and familiarly as she walks down the cellblock. Chick becomes angry and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses or two-times him before he gets out. She lies and claims she has been true to him. Gus gives counterfeit money to Rita and Sergei to spend. Chick escapes from jail, and police search for him in the bar. He comes into Lou&#x27;s room and starts to strangle her, breaking off only because he still loves her and cannot harm her. Lou calms him down by promising that she will go with him when she finishes her next number.

After Sergei gives Lou a diamond pin belonging to Rita, Rita starts a fight with Lou, who accidentally stabs her to death. Lou calmly combs the dead woman&#x27;s long hair to hide the fact Rita is dead while the police search the room for Chick Clark. She has her bodyguard Spider, who &quot;would do anything for you, Lou&quot; dispose of Rita&#x27;s body. She then tells Spider to bring Chick, who&#x27;s hiding in an alley, back to her room upstairs. Then, while she sings &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;, she silently signals to Dan Flynn that he should go to her room to wait for her, even though she knows Chick is in there with a gun. Chick shoots Dan dead and the gunfire draws a police raid. Cummings shows his badge and reveals himself as &quot;The Hawk&quot;, a well-known Federal agent, as he arrests Gus and Sergei. Chick, still lurking in Lou&#x27;s room, is about to kill Lou for double-crossing him, when Cummings also apprehends him.

Cummings then takes Lou away in an open horse-drawn carriage instead of the paddywagon into which all the other criminals have been loaded. He tells her she doesn&#x27;t belong in jail and removes all her other rings and slips a diamond engagement ring onto her left ring finger.

== Cast==
* Mae West as Lady Lou
* Cary Grant as Capt. Cummings
* Owen Moore as Chick Clark
* Gilbert Roland as Sergei Stanieff
* Noah Beery Sr. as Gus Jordan
* David Landau as Dan Flynn
* Rafaela Ottiano as Russian Rita
* Dewey Robinson as Spider Kane
* Rochelle Hudson as Sally
* Tammany Young as Chuck Connors
* Fuzzy Knight as Ragtime Kelly
* Grace La Rue as Frances Kelly
* Robert Homans as Doheney
* Louise Beavers as Pearl (Lou&#x27;s maid)
==Production==
The film was directed by Lowell Sherman and produced by William LeBaron. The script was adapted by Harvey F. Thew and John Bright. Original music was composed by Ralph Rainger, John Leipold and Stephan Pasternacki. Charles Lang was responsible for the cinematography, and the costumes were designed by Edith Head.

&quot;Blonde Venus&quot; (with Marlene Dietrich) and &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; (with Sylvia Sidney), both predate &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; but West always claimed to have discovered Grant for her film, claiming that until then Grant had only made &quot;some tests with starlets&quot;.

The Hays Code declared the play &quot;Diamond Lil&quot; banned from the screen and repeatedly demanded changes to remove associations with or elements from the play, including suggested titles with the word &quot;diamond&quot;. The adaption was finally allowed under the condition that the play not be referred to in publicity or advertising. Joseph Breen, who oversaw the more effectual enforcement of the Code beginning in 1934, blocked &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; from being rereleased in 1935 and again in 1949.

Rafaela Ottiano, who portrayed Russian Rita in the Broadway version, was cast on West&#x27;s recommendation in the same role, which led to work with West throughout her career.

Louise Beavers was the only African-American actress to be brought onto the film by West personally. She wanted a black woman to appear with her. When she did stage and screen work, West made it a point to act with black American actors and actresses, helping to break racial discrimination in entertainment. West&#x27;s stage shows resulted in her arrest for saucy material and her having black actors on stage was extremely controversial. With this film, she and her Paramount bosses called the shots: Black stars appeared in a few of her films after this one.

==Reception==
The film was a box-office success, grossing $2,000,000 domestically with a budget of $200,000. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Bige&quot; gave &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; a negative review, stating that Paramount was attempting to rush Mae West to stardom by giving her her own film and top billing, and that the film was not very good without known actors and an entertaining story, despite the presence of extremely well-known actors Noah Beery Sr. and Owen Moore, not to mention up-and-comer Cary Grant.

&quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Outstanding Production, now known as Best Picture. At 66 minutes, it is the shortest film to be so honored.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 1998: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies – Nominated
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #75
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; – Nominated
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** Lady Lou: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you come up sometime and see me?&quot; – #26
* 2007: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – Nominated

==Note==
West&#x27;s famous line to Cary Grant is &quot;Why don&#x27;t you come up some time and see me?&quot; in &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;. She changed it to &quot;Come up and see me sometime&quot; in her next movie &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot;, released the same year and co-starring Grant.

&quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; bears some resemblances to &quot;The Bowery&quot;, a film released later the same year by United Artists starring Noah Beery&#x27;s brother Wallace. The two films each include a saloon owner named Chuck Conners as a main character (played by Wallace Beery) in &quot;The Bowery&quot; and a smaller role (played by Tammany Young) in &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;.

The animated cartoon short &quot;She Done Him Right&quot; followed in 1933 as a parody spinoff of &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;.

Universal Pictures, through its EMKA division, currently handles distribution of the film.

<text>A state fair is an annual competitive and recreational gathering of a U.S. state&#x27;s population, usually held in late summer or early fall. It is a larger version of a county fair, often including only exhibits or competitors that have won in their categories at the more-local county fairs.

State fairs began in the nineteenth century for the purpose of promoting state agriculture, through competitive exhibitions of livestock and display of farm products. As the U.S. evolved from a predominantly agrarian to an industrial society in the twentieth century, and the more service economy of the 21st century, modern state fairs have expanded to include carnival amusement rides and games, display of industrial products, automobile racing, and entertainment such as musical concerts. Large fairs can admit more than a million visitors over the course of a week or two. The oldest state fair is that of The Fredericksburg Agricultural Fair, established in 1738, and is the oldest fair in Virginia and the United States. The first U.S. state fair was the New York, held in 1841 in Syracuse, and has been held annually since. The second state fair was in Detroit, Michigan, which ran from 1849 to 2009. The fair was revived in 2013 and has been held at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi, Michigan ever since.

Events similar to state fairs are also held annually in each state capital in Australia, known as royal shows. Australian royal shows are organized by state agricultural and horticultural societies, and are described further in the agricultural show article.

==List of state fairs==

;Notes
===State fair police departments===
Several state fairs maintain their own police departments, including:
*California Exposition and State Fair Police
*Iowa State Fair Police
*Minnesota State Fair Police Department
*Wisconsin State Fair Park Police Department

==Provincial exhibitions in Canada==

A few annual exhibitions in the summer in Canada are similar to state fairs in the United States:

==Awards==
State and county fairs are famous for a variety of competitions that award &quot;ribbons&quot;. Awards are generally given according to the following scale:
* First place – blue ribbon
* Second place – red ribbon
* Third place – white ribbon
* Fourth place – yellow ribbon
* Fifth place – green ribbon
* Sixth place – orange ribbon
*Seventh place – purple ribbon
*Eighth place – brown ribbon

==Attendance==
As of 2019, the largest attendance at a state fair in the US is in Texas with the fair having attracted 2,514,637 visitors. Even though it is longer than an average state fair, any advantage is negated by the size of the physical state since those days would be required for the states citizens to have equal opportunity to attend.

The largest average per day attendance is at the Minnesota State Fair averaging just under 200,000 people per day.

<doc id="60157" wikidata="Q612540" url="?curid=60157" title="The Good Earth (film)">
<text>The Good Earth is a 1937 American drama film about Chinese farmers who struggle to survive. It was adapted by Talbot Jennings, Tess Slesinger, and Claudine West from the 1932 play by Owen Davis and Donald Davis, which was in itself based on the 1931 novel of the same name by Nobel Prize-winning author Pearl S. Buck. The film was directed by Sidney Franklin, with uncredited contributions by Victor Fleming and Gustav Machaty.

The film stars Paul Muni as Wang Lung. For her role as his wife O-Lan, Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for Best Actress. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for Karl Freund. It was nominated for Best Director, Best Film Editing, and Best Picture. Its world premiere was at the elegant Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles.

==Plot==
In pre-World War I English-speaking northern China, young farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni) marries O-Lan (Luise Rainer), a slave at the Great House, the residence of the most powerful family in their village. O-Lan proves to be an excellent wife, hard working and uncomplaining. Wang Lung prospers. He buys more land, and O-Lan gives birth to two sons and a daughter. Meanwhile, the Great House begins to decline.

All is well until a drought and the resulting famine drive the family to the brink. O-Lan gives birth to a second daughter but kills her shortly after birth to spare her from starvation. Desperate, Wang Lung considers the advice of his pessimistic, worthless uncle (Walter Connolly) to sell his land for food, but O-Lan opposes it. Instead, they travel south to a city in search of work. The family survives by begging and stealing. When a revolutionary gives a speech to try to drum up support for the army approaching despite rain in the north, Wang Lung and O-Lan realize the drought is over. They long to return to their farm, but they have no money for an ox, seed, and food.

The city changes hands, and O-Lan joins a mob looting a mansion. However, she is knocked down and trampled upon. When she comes to, she finds a bag of jewels overlooked in the confusion. This windfall allows the family to go home and prosper once more. O-Lan asks only to keep two pearls for herself.

Years pass. Wang Lung&#x27;s sons grow up into educated young men, and he has grown so wealthy that he purchases the Great House. Then, Wang Lung becomes besotted with Lotus (Tilly Losch), a pretty, young dancer at the local tea house, and makes her his second wife. He begins to find fault with the worn-out O-Lan. Desperate to gain affection from Lotus, he gives O-Lan&#x27;s pearls to Lotus.

When Wang Lung discovers that Lotus has seduced Younger Son (Roland Lui), he orders his son to leave. Then a swarm of locusts threatens the entire village. Using a strategy devised by Elder Son (Keye Luke), everyone unites to try to save the crops. Just when all seems lost, the wind shifts direction, taking the danger away. The near-disaster brings Wang Lung back to his senses. He reconciles with Younger Son. On the latter&#x27;s wedding day, Wang Lung returns the pearls to O-Lan before she dies, completely exhausted by a hard life. Without disturbing the wedding festivities, Wang Lung quietly exits the house and regards a flowering peach tree planted by O-Lan on their marriage day. Reverently he murmurs, &quot;O-Lan, you are the earth.&quot;

==Production==
The film&#x27;s budget was $2.8 million, a small fortune at the time, and took three years to make. A five-hundred-acre farm in Porter Ranch, California, was transformed into a replica of Chinese farmland for this film.

The movie script was more sympathetic to China than the novel had been. Wang Lung&#x27;s son was now a representative of modern China who goes to university and leads the villagers. The family is a wholesome affectionate unit, even the uncle who in the novel exploits Wang Lung, and the sexual aspect of Lotus is played down. The Hays office, which supervised each Hollywood script, demanded more than twenty rewrites to eliminate what it found offensive. Before Herbert Stothart and Edward Ward were engaged to provide the music, negotiations took place with Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg, who is known to have made some musical sketches for the score before the plan fell through.

Pearl Buck intended the film to be cast with all Chinese or Chinese-American actors. Irving Thalberg also envisioned casting only Chinese actors, but had to concede that American audiences were not ready for such a film. According to Variety, Anna May Wong had been suggested for the role of O-Lan, but the Hays Code anti-miscegenation rules required Paul Muni&#x27;s character&#x27;s wife to be played by a white actress. Some confusion has resulted because the Production Code of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Inc., 1930–1934 stated only that &quot;miscegenation (sex relationship between the white and black races) is forbidden&quot;. Chinese-American actress Soo Yong, in fact, was cast as the Chinese aunt who was married to the uncle played by Caucasian actor Walter Connolly. MGM offered Wong the role of Lotus, but she refused, stating, &quot;You&#x27;re asking me – with Chinese blood – to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese characters.&quot; Many of the characters were played by white actors made to look Asian through yellowface, make-up techniques developed by Jack Dawn and used for the first time in this film. Others in the supporting cast were Chinese American actors.

When MGM inquired into the possibility of making the film in China, the Chinese government was divided on how to respond. Initial hostility derived from resentment of the novel, which critics charged focused only on the perceived backwardness of the country, while some government officials hoped to have control which would be gone if the film work was done outside China. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek himself intervened, perhaps at the behest of his wife, Mme. Chiang, whose American education made her an advocate for cooperation. Permission was granted on condition that the view of China be favorable, that the Chinese government would supervise and have control of shots done in China, and the unenforced stipulation that the entire cast be Chinese. The government in Nanjing did not foresee the sympathy the film would create and when MGM decided to shoot on location in China officials took extraordinary steps to control the production, forcing the studio to hire a Nationalist general to advise them on authentic settings and costumes (most of this footage was mysteriously lost when it was shipped home and had to be re-shot in California). There were reports that MGM distributed a different version of the film in China.

The film&#x27;s 1936 production lasted from February 28 to July 23. Thalberg died on September 14, four-and-a-half months before its Los Angeles premiere on January 29, 1937. The film credits stated that this was his &quot;last great achievement&quot;. Original prints of the film were presented in sepiatone.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were positive. Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;a superb translation of a literary classic ... one of the finest things Hollywood has done this season or any other. While it has taken some liberties with the novel&#x27;s text, it has taken none with its quality or spirit.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; declared it &quot;a remarkable screen production&quot; and called Muni&#x27;s performance &quot;splendid&quot;, but questioned whether the subject matter would make for good box office. &quot;Film Daily&quot; raved, &quot;A &#x27;must see&#x27; picture, possessing absorbing drama, passionate sincerity and brilliant performance.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a vast and rich film.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; described it as &quot;a highly artistic piece of work,&quot; and while not exactly an entertaining picture, &quot;those who see it will undoubtedly be awed by its magnificence.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in the UK, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed good review, characterizing the first half of the film as &quot;simple and direct and true&quot;, but complaining that the second half displays &quot;a little less than life&quot; and that the last hour was permeated by &quot;banality and ennui&quot;. Discussing the actors, Greene praised Rainer for a &quot;beautiful performance&quot; that &quot;carries the film&quot;, and criticized Muni&#x27;s performance as exaggerated and &quot;not of the same quality&quot; as Rainer&#x27;s.

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $2,002,000 in the US and Canada and $1,555,000 elsewhere but because of its high cost incurred an ultimate loss of $96,000.

<doc id="60161" wikidata="Q870551" url="?curid=60161" title="The Maltese Falcon (novel)">
<text>The Maltese Falcon is a 1930 detective novel by American writer Dashiell Hammett, originally serialized in the magazine &quot;Black Mask&quot; beginning with the September 1929 issue. The story is told entirely in external third-person narrative; there is no description whatsoever of any character&#x27;s thoughts or feelings, only what they say and do, and how they look. The novel has been adapted several times for the cinema. It is considered part of the hardboiled genre, which Hammett played a major part in popularizing.

The main character, Sam Spade (who also appeared later in some lesser-known short stories), was a departure from Hammett&#x27;s nameless detective, The Continental Op. Spade combined several features of previous detectives, notably his cold detachment, keen eye for detail, unflinching and sometimes ruthless determination to achieve his own form of justice, and a complete lack of sentimentality. In 1990 the novel ranked 10th in Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list by the Crime Writers&#x27; Association. Five years later, in a similar list by Mystery Writers of America, the novel was ranked third.

==Plot==

Sam Spade is a private detective in San Francisco, in partnership with Miles Archer. The beautiful &quot;Miss Wonderley&quot; hires them to follow Floyd Thursby, who she claims has run off with her sister. Archer takes the first stint but is found shot dead that night. Thursby is also killed later and Spade is a suspect. The next morning, Spade coolly tells his office secretary, Effie Perine, to have the office door repainted to read simply &quot;Samuel Spade&quot;.

&quot;Miss Wonderley&quot; is soon revealed to be an acquisitive adventuress named Brigid O&#x27;Shaughnessy, who is involved in the search for a black statuette of unknown but substantial value. Others are after this falcon, including Joel Cairo, an effeminate criminal, and Casper Gutman, a fat man accompanied by a vicious young gunman, Wilmer Cook. O&#x27;Shaughnessy begs for Spade&#x27;s protection while telling him as little as possible. They meet with Cairo at Spade&#x27;s apartment, and Spade again presses O&#x27;Shaughnessy for details; again she stalls but kisses Spade. The next morning, she is asleep in his bed. Leaving her there, Spade slips out to search her apartment. 
Effie believes O&#x27;Shaughnessy &quot;is all right&quot; and Spade should help her. Effie agrees to hide her at her own home, but O&#x27;Shaughnessy disappears again. When Spade meets Gutman in his hotel room, neither will tell what he knows. Spade implies he is looking out for himself, not O&#x27;Shaughnessy. Red herrings abound. The police suspect Spade in the shootings: he was sleeping with Archer&#x27;s wife, Iva. The District Attorney ties the shootings to Dixie Monahan, a Chicago gambler who had employed Thursby as a bodyguard in the Far East.

At a second meeting, Gutman tells Spade the history of the tribute of the Maltese Falcon. It was made of gold and jewels by the 16th-century Knights of Malta as a gift to the King of Spain but was captured by pirates. After passing from owner to owner, at some time it was coated with black enamel to conceal its value. Gutman traced the falcon to General Kemidov, a Russian exile in Constantinople and hired O&#x27;Shaughnessy to get it; she brought in Cairo to help. O&#x27;Shaughnessy and Thursby fled with the falcon to Hong Kong and from there to San Francisco. During this conversation, Gutman drugs Spade, who passes out on the floor.

Spade awakens alone and returns to his office where a wounded ship&#x27;s captain staggers in with a package containing the falcon and dies. O&#x27;Shaughnessy calls the office, begs for Spade&#x27;s help, but sends him on a wild goose chase. When he returns, O&#x27;Shaughnessy is waiting in front of Spade&#x27;s apartment building. Inside Spade&#x27;s apartment they find Gutman, Wilmer, and Cairo in wait with guns drawn. Gutman presents $10,000 in cash for the falcon, but Spade argues that the police must arrest someone for the murders. During a fight, Spade knocks Wilmer out, and Gutman agrees to give Wilmer to the police.

Spade has Effie fetch the falcon, but Gutman discovers it is a fake (a decoy made by General Kemidov, or possibly the falcon of legend was never real). During the excitement, Wilmer escapes. Gutman decides to go to Constantinople for the real falcon; Cairo joins him and they leave. Spade then calls the police and tells them the story, adding that he has Wilmer&#x27;s guns and other evidence. While they are waiting, he bullies O&#x27;Shaughnessy into confessing her real role. 

Archer was shot with Thursby&#x27;s gun, but by her. She has lied to him and double-crossed him. O&#x27;Shaughnessy admits all this, but pleads that she is in love with Spade. Maybe he does care for her, Spade admits, but tells her, &quot;I won&#x27;t play the sap for you&quot;for personal reasons as well as needing justice for his dead partner; if she can get off with a long prison term, he&#x27;ll wait for her, but if she hangs, he&#x27;ll always remember her. When the police arrive, he turns her in, and the police tell him Wilmer has just shot Gutman dead.

==Background==

Although Hammett himself worked for a time as a private detective for the Pinkerton Detective Agency in San Francisco (and used his given name, Samuel, for the story&#x27;s protagonist), Hammett asserted that &quot;Spade has no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been, and, in their cockier moments, thought they approached.&quot;

Hammett reportedly drew upon his years as a detective in creating many of the other characters for &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, which reworks elements from some of his stories published in &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine in 1925, &quot;The Whosis Kid&quot; and &quot;The Gutting of Couffignal&quot;. The novel was serialized in five parts in &quot;Black Mask&quot; in 1929 and 1930 before being published in book form in 1930 by Alfred A. Knopf.

==Adaptations==

The novel has been adapted for film four times, twice under its original title: 
*&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1931), the first version, a pre-Code production starring Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade and Bebe Daniels as Brigid O&#x27;Shaughnessy. In 1936, Warner Brothers attempted to re-release the film but was denied approval by the Hays Production Code censors because of its &quot;lewd&quot; content; this led to the production of the 1936 adaptation. It was not until after 1966 that unedited copies of the 1931 film could be shown in the United States. 
*&quot;Satan Met a Lady&quot; (1936), a comedic adaptation starring Bette Davis and Warren William, with Sam Spade becoming &quot;Ted Shane&quot;. The film received poor reviews, and Davis later referred to the film as &quot;junk&quot;.
*&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), the third and best-known version, considered to be a &quot;film noir&quot; classic. This version dropped much of the suggestive content in the 1931 version. The film stars Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Gladys George.
*&quot;The Black Bird&quot; (1975), a spoof sequel, featuring George Segal as Sam Spade Jr. (Elisha Cook Jr. and Lee Patrick reprised their roles from the 1941 film.)

There have been two audio adaptations of the novel:
*&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1984), a full-cast dramatization by BBC Radio 4, featuring Jane Lapotaire and Tom Wilkinson.
*&quot;Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s The Maltese Falcon&quot; (2008), an audio dramatization by the Hollywood Theater of the Ear.

There have also been US stage adaptations:
*&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; was produced by The Long Beach Shakespeare Company and premiered on April 29, 2005, when Hammett&#x27;s book was adapted and directed by Martin Pope. Two years later the same company mounted a second adaptation, this one by Helen Borgers, the company&#x27;s artistic director.
*&quot;The Maltese Murder&quot; (2008), by playwright Bryan Colley, commissioned by the Johnson County Library in Kansas as part of the National Endowment for the Arts Big Read.

<text>Tidal locking between a pair of co-orbiting astronomical bodies occurs when one of the objects reaches a state where there is no longer any net change in its rotation rate over the course of a complete orbit. In the case where a tidally locked body possesses synchronous rotation, the object takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner. For example, the same side of the Moon always faces Earth, although there is some variability because the Moon&#x27;s orbit is not perfectly circular. Usually, only the satellite is tidally locked to the larger body. However, if both the difference in mass between the two bodies and the distance between them are relatively small, each may be tidally locked to the other; this is the case for Pluto and Charon, and for Eris and Dysnomia. Alternative names for the tidal locking process are gravitational locking, captured rotation, and spin–orbit locking. 

The effect arises between two bodies when their gravitational interaction slows a body&#x27;s rotation until it becomes tidally locked. Over many millions of years, the interaction forces changes to their orbits and rotation rates as a result of energy exchange and heat dissipation. When one of the bodies reaches a state where there is no longer any net change in its rotation rate over the course of a complete orbit, it is said to be tidally locked. The object tends to stay in this state because leaving it would require adding energy back into the system. The object&#x27;s orbit may migrate over time so as to undo the tidal lock, for example, if a giant planet perturbs the object.

There is ambiguity in the use of the terms &#x27;tidally locked&#x27; and &#x27;tidal locking&#x27;, in that some scientific sources use it to refer exclusively to 1:1 synchronous rotation (e.g. the Moon), while others include non-synchronous orbital resonances in which there is no further transfer of angular momentum over the course of one orbit (e.g. Mercury). In Mercury&#x27;s case, the planet completes three rotations for every two revolutions around the Sun, a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance. In the special case where an orbit is nearly circular and the body&#x27;s rotation axis is not significantly tilted, such as the Moon, tidal locking results in the same hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner.
Regardless of which definition of tidal locking is used, the hemisphere that is visible changes slightly due to variations in the locked body&#x27;s orbital velocity and the inclination of its rotation axis over time.

==Mechanism==


Consider a pair of co-orbiting objects, A and B. The change in rotation rate necessary to tidally lock body B to the larger body A is caused by the torque applied by A&#x27;s gravity on bulges it has induced on B by tidal forces.

The gravitational force from object A upon B will vary with distance, being greatest at the nearest surface to A and least at the most distant. This creates a gravitational gradient across object B that will distort its equilibrium shape slightly. The body of object B will become elongated along the axis oriented toward A, and conversely, slightly reduced in dimension in directions orthogonal to this axis. The elongated distortions are known as tidal bulges. (For the solid Earth, these bulges can reach displacements of up to around .) When B is not yet tidally locked, the bulges travel over its surface due to orbital motions, with one of the two &quot;high&quot; tidal bulges traveling close to the point where body A is overhead. For large astronomical bodies that are nearly spherical due to self-gravitation, the tidal distortion produces a slightly prolate spheroid, i.e. an axially symmetric ellipsoid that is elongated along its major axis. Smaller bodies also experience distortion, but this distortion is less regular.

The material of B exerts resistance to this periodic reshaping caused by the tidal force. In effect, some time is required to reshape B to the gravitational equilibrium shape, by which time the forming bulges have already been carried some distance away from the A–B axis by B&#x27;s rotation. Seen from a vantage point in space, the points of maximum bulge extension are displaced from the axis oriented toward A. If B&#x27;s rotation period is shorter than its orbital period, the bulges are carried forward of the axis oriented toward A in the direction of rotation, whereas if B&#x27;s rotation period is longer, the bulges instead lag behind.

Because the bulges are now displaced from the A–B axis, A&#x27;s gravitational pull on the mass in them exerts a torque on B. The torque on the A-facing bulge acts to bring B&#x27;s rotation in line with its orbital period, whereas the &quot;back&quot; bulge, which faces away from A, acts in the opposite sense. However, the bulge on the A-facing side is closer to A than the back bulge by a distance of approximately B&#x27;s diameter, and so experiences a slightly stronger gravitational force and torque. The net resulting torque from both bulges, then, is always in the direction that acts to synchronize B&#x27;s rotation with its orbital period, leading eventually to tidal locking.

===Orbital changes===
The angular momentum of the whole A–B system is conserved in this process, so that when B slows down and loses rotational angular momentum, its &quot;orbital&quot; angular momentum is boosted by a similar amount (there are also some smaller effects on A&#x27;s rotation). This results in a raising of B&#x27;s orbit about A in tandem with its rotational slowdown. For the other case where B starts off rotating too slowly, tidal locking both speeds up its rotation, and &quot;lowers&quot; its orbit.

===Locking of the larger body===

The tidal locking effect is also experienced by the larger body A, but at a slower rate because B&#x27;s gravitational effect is weaker due to B&#x27;s smaller mass. For example, Earth&#x27;s rotation is gradually being slowed by the Moon, by an amount that becomes noticeable over geological time as revealed in the fossil record. Current estimations are that this (together with the tidal influence of the Sun) has helped lengthen the Earth day from about 6 hours to the current 24 hours (over about 4.5 billion years). Currently, atomic clocks show that Earth&#x27;s day lengthens, on average, by about 2.3 milliseconds per century. Given enough time, this would create a mutual tidal locking between Earth and the Moon. The length of Earth&#x27;s day would increase and the length of a lunar month would also increase. Earth&#x27;s sidereal day would eventually have the same length as the Moon&#x27;s orbital period, about 47 times the length of the Earth day at present. However, Earth is not expected to become tidally locked to the Moon before the Sun becomes a red giant and engulfs Earth and the Moon.

For bodies of similar size the effect may be of comparable size for both, and both may become tidally locked to each other on a much shorter timescale. An example is the dwarf planet Pluto and its satellite Charon. They have already reached a state where Charon is visible from only one hemisphere of Pluto and vice versa.

===Eccentric orbits===
For orbits that do not have an eccentricity close to zero, the rotation rate tends to become locked with the orbital speed when the body is at periapsis, which is the point of strongest tidal interaction between the two objects. If the orbiting object has a companion, this third body can cause the rotation rate of the parent object to vary in an oscillatory manner. This interaction can also drive an increase in orbital eccentricity of the orbiting object around the primary – an effect known as eccentricity pumping.

In some cases where the orbit is eccentric and the tidal effect is relatively weak, the smaller body may end up in a so-called spin–orbit resonance, rather than being tidally locked. Here, the ratio of the rotation period of a body to its own orbital period is some simple fraction different from 1:1. A well known case is the rotation of Mercury, which is locked to its own orbit around the Sun in a 3:2 resonance. This results in the rotation speed roughly matching the orbital speed around perihelion.

Many exoplanets (especially the close-in ones) are expected to be in spin–orbit resonances higher than 1:1. A Mercury-like terrestrial planet can, for example, become captured in a 3:2, 2:1, or 5:2 spin–orbit resonance, with the probability of each being dependent on the orbital eccentricity.

==Occurrence==

===Moons===

All twenty known moons in the Solar System that are large enough to be round are tidally locked with their primaries, because they orbit very closely and tidal force increases rapidly (as a cubic function) with decreasing distance. On the other hand, most of the irregular outer satellites of the giant planets (e.g. Phoebe), which orbit much farther away than the large well-known moons, are not tidally locked.

Pluto and Charon are an extreme example of a tidal lock. Charon is a relatively large moon in comparison to its primary and also has a very close orbit. This results in Pluto and Charon being mutually tidally locked. Pluto&#x27;s other moons are not tidally locked; Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra all rotate chaotically due to the influence of Charon. Similarly, and Dysnomia are mutually tidally locked. and Vanth might also be mutually tidally locked, but the data is not conclusive.

The tidal locking situation for asteroid moons is largely unknown, but closely orbiting binaries are expected to be tidally locked, as well as contact binaries.

====Earth&#x27;s Moon====

Earth&#x27;s Moon&#x27;s rotation and orbital periods are tidally locked with each other, so no matter when the Moon is observed from Earth, the same hemisphere of the Moon is always seen. Most of the far side of the Moon was not seen until 1959, when photographs of most of the far side were transmitted from the Soviet spacecraft &quot;Luna 3&quot;.

When Earth is observed from the Moon, Earth does not appear to move across the sky. It remains in the same place while showing nearly all its surface as it rotates on its axis.

Despite the Moon&#x27;s rotational and orbital periods being exactly locked, about 59 percent of the Moon&#x27;s total surface may be seen with repeated observations from Earth, due to the phenomena of libration and parallax. Librations are primarily caused by the Moon&#x27;s varying orbital speed due to the eccentricity of its orbit: this allows up to about 6° more along its perimeter to be seen from Earth. Parallax is a geometric effect: at the surface of Earth observers are offset from the line through the centers of Earth and Moon; this accounts for about a 1° difference in the Moon&#x27;s surface which can be seen around the sides of the Moon when comparing observations made during moonrise and moonset.

===Planets===
It was thought for some time that Mercury was in synchronous rotation with the Sun. This was because whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, the same side faced inward. Radar observations in 1965 demonstrated instead that Mercury has a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun, which results in the same positioning at those observation points. Modeling has demonstrated that Mercury was captured into the 3:2 spin–orbit state very early in its history, probably within 10–20 million years after its formation.

The 583.92-day interval between successive close approaches of Venus to Earth is equal to 5.001444 Venusian solar days, making approximately the same face visible from Earth at each close approach. Whether this relationship arose by chance or is the result of some kind of tidal locking with Earth is unknown.

The exoplanet Proxima Centauri b discovered in 2016 which orbits around Proxima Centauri, is almost certainly tidally locked, expressing either synchronized rotation or a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance like that of Mercury.

One form of hypothetical tidally locked exoplanets are eyeball planets, which in turn are divided into &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; eyeball planets.

===Stars===
Close binary stars throughout the universe are expected to be tidally locked with each other, and extrasolar planets that have been found to orbit their primaries extremely closely are also thought to be tidally locked to them. An unusual example, confirmed by MOST, may be Tau Boötis, a star that is probably tidally locked by its planet Tau Boötis b. If so, the tidal locking is almost certainly mutual.

==Timescale==
An estimate of the time for a body to become tidally locked can be obtained using the following formula:

:formula_1

where
* formula_2 is the initial spin rate expressed in radians per second,
* formula_3 is the semi-major axis of the motion of the satellite around the planet (given by the average of the periapsis and apoapsis distances),
* formula_4 formula_5 is the moment of inertia of the satellite, where formula_6 is the mass of the satellite and formula_7 is the mean radius of the satellite,
* formula_8 is the dissipation function of the satellite,
* formula_9 is the gravitational constant,
* formula_10 is the mass of the planet (i.e., the object being orbited), and
* formula_11 is the tidal Love number of the satellite.

formula_12 and formula_13 are generally very poorly known except for the Moon, which has formula_14. For a really rough estimate it is common to take formula_15 (perhaps conservatively, giving overestimated locking times), and
:formula_16
where
* formula_17 is the density of the satellite
* formula_18 is the surface gravity of the satellite
* formula_19 is the rigidity of the satellite. This can be roughly taken as 3 N/m2 for rocky objects and 4 N/m2 for icy ones.

Even knowing the size and density of the satellite leaves many parameters that must be estimated (especially &quot;ω&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, and &quot;μ&quot;), so that any calculated locking times obtained are expected to be inaccurate, even to factors of ten. Further, during the tidal locking phase the semi-major axis formula_20 may have been significantly different from that observed nowadays due to subsequent tidal acceleration, and the locking time is extremely sensitive to this value.

Because the uncertainty is so high, the above formulas can be simplified to give a somewhat less cumbersome one. By assuming that the satellite is spherical, formula_21, and it is sensible to guess one revolution every 12 hours in the initial non-locked state (most asteroids have rotational periods between about 2 hours and about 2 days)

:formula_22

with masses in kilograms, distances in meters, and formula_23 in newtons per meter squared; formula_23 can be roughly taken as 3 N/m2 for rocky objects and 4 N/m2 for icy ones.

There is an extremely strong dependence on semi-major axis formula_20.

For the locking of a primary body to its satellite as in the case of Pluto, the satellite and primary body parameters can be swapped.

One conclusion is that, &quot;other things being equal&quot; (such as formula_12 and formula_23), a large moon will lock faster than a smaller moon at the same orbital distance from the planet because formula_28 grows as the cube of the satellite radius formula_7. A possible example of this is in the Saturn system, where Hyperion is not tidally locked, whereas the larger Iapetus, which orbits at a greater distance, is. However, this is not clear cut because Hyperion also experiences strong driving from the nearby Titan, which forces its rotation to be chaotic.

The above formulae for the timescale of locking may be off by orders of magnitude, because they ignore the frequency dependence of formula_30. More importantly, they may be inapplicable to viscous binaries (double stars, or double asteroids that are rubble), because the spin–orbit dynamics of such bodies is defined mainly by their viscosity, not rigidity.

==List of known tidally locked bodies==

===Solar System===
All the bodies below are tidally locked, and all but Mercury are moreover in synchronous rotation. (Mercury is tidally locked, but not in synchronous rotation.)

===Extra-solar===
* The most successful detection methods of exoplanets (transits and radial velocities) suffer from a clear observational bias favoring the detection of planets near the star; thus, 85% of the exoplanets detected are inside the tidal locking zone, which makes it difficult to estimate the true incidence of this phenomenon. Tau Boötis is known to be locked to the close-orbiting giant planet Tau Boötis b.

==Bodies likely to be locked==

===Solar System===
Based on comparison between the likely time needed to lock a body to its primary, and the time it has been in its present orbit (comparable with the age of the Solar System for most planetary moons), a number of moons are thought to be locked. However their rotations are not known or not known enough. These are:

====Probably locked to Saturn====

* Daphnis
* Aegaeon
* Methone
* Anthe
* Pallene
* Helene
* Polydeuces
====Probably locked to Uranus====

* Cordelia
* Ophelia
* Bianca
* Cressida
* Desdemona
* Juliet
* Portia
* Rosalind
* Cupid
* Belinda
* Perdita
* Puck
* Mab
====Probably locked to Neptune====

* Naiad
* Thalassa
* Despina
* Galatea
* Larissa
====Probably mutually tidally locked====
*Orcus and Vanth

===Extrasolar===
* Gliese 581c, Gliese 581g, Gliese 581b, and Gliese 581e may be tidally locked to their parent star Gliese 581. Gliese 581d is almost certainly captured either into the 2:1 or the 3:2 spin–orbit resonance with the same star.
* All planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system are likely to be tidally locked.

<doc id="60164" wikidata="Q204191" url="?curid=60164" title="It's a Wonderful Life">
<text>It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life is a 1946 American Christmas fantasy drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra. It is based on the short story and booklet &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;, self-published by Philip Van Doren Stern in 1943, which itself is loosely based on the 1843 Charles Dickens novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has given up his personal dreams to help others in his community and whose thoughts of suicide on Christmas Eve bring about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody. Clarence shows George all the lives he touched and what the world would be like if he had not existed.

Although it was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; initially received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office. Theatrically, the film&#x27;s break-even point was $6.3 million, about twice the production cost, a figure it did not come close to achieving on its initial release. Because of the film&#x27;s disappointing sales, Capra was seen by some studios as having lost his ability to produce popular, financially successful films. Its copyright in the U.S. expired in 1974 following a lack of renewal and it entered the public domain, allowing it to be broadcast without licensing or royalty fees, at which point it became a Christmas classic.

&quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; is now considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and among the best Christmas films. It has been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made. It was no. 11 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 1998 greatest movie list, no. 20 on its 2007 greatest movie list, no. 8 on its list of greatest love stories, and no. 1 on its list of the most inspirational American films of all time. In 1990, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; became one of 25 films selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Capra revealed that it was his favorite among the films he directed and that he screened it for his family every Christmas season. It was one of Stewart&#x27;s favorite films. A modern remake of the film, written and directed by Kenya Barris, is in development at Paramount Pictures as of January 2024.

==Plot==

On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey contemplates suicide. The prayers of his family and friends reach Heaven, where guardian angel second class Clarence Odbody is assigned to save George in order to earn his wings. 

Clarence is shown flashbacks of George&#x27;s life. He watches 12-year-old George rescue his younger brother Harry from drowning in a frozen pond, leaving George with an ear infection and, subsequently, deafness in his left ear. George later saves the pharmacist, Mr. Gower, from accidentally poisoning a customer.

In 1928, George plans a world tour before college. He is reintroduced to Mary Hatch, who has loved him since childhood. When his father dies from a stroke, George postpones his travel to settle the family business, Bailey Brothers Building and Loan. 

Avaricious board member Henry Potter, who owns the bank and most of the town, seeks to dissolve the company, but the board of directors votes to keep it open if George runs it. George acquiesces and works alongside his uncle Billy, giving his tuition savings to Harry with the understanding that Harry will take over the company when he graduates.

Harry returns from college married and with a job offer from his father-in-law, and George resigns himself to running the building and loan. George and Mary rekindle their relationship and marry, but abandon their honeymoon to use their savings to keep the company solvent during a run on the bank. 

Under George, the company establishes Bailey Park, a housing development surpassing Potter&#x27;s overpriced slums. Potter entices George with a high-paying job, but George rebuffs him when he realizes that Potter&#x27;s true intention is to close the building and loan.

On Christmas Eve, the town prepares a hero&#x27;s welcome for Harry, a Navy fighter pilot awarded the Medal of Honor for preventing a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on a troopship. Billy goes to Potter&#x27;s bank to deposit $8,000 of the building and loan&#x27;s money. He taunts Potter with a newspaper headline about Harry, but absentmindedly wraps the cash in Potter&#x27;s newspaper. 

Potter keeps the money, while Billy cannot recall how he misplaced it. With a bank examiner reviewing the company&#x27;s records, George fruitlessly retraces Billy&#x27;s steps. Frustrated and angered by Billy&#x27;s blunder, which may lead to scandal and jail, George resents the sacrifices he has made and the family that has kept him trapped in Bedford Falls. He appeals to Potter for a loan, offering his meager life insurance policy as collateral. Potter scoffs that George is worth more dead than alive and phones the police.

George flees Potter&#x27;s office, gets drunk at a bar, and prays for help. Contemplating suicide, he goes to a bridge. Before George can jump, Clarence dives into the river and George rescues him. When George wishes he had never been born, Clarence shows George an alternate timeline in which he never existed. Bedford Falls is Pottersville, an unsavory town occupied by sleazy entertainment venues and callous people. Mr. Gower was jailed for manslaughter because George was not there to stop him from poisoning the customer. Uncle Billy was institutionalized after the building and loan failed. Bailey Park is a cemetery, where George discovers Harry&#x27;s grave: without George, Harry drowned as a child, and without Harry to save them, the troops aboard the transport ship were killed. George finds that Mary is an &quot;old maid&quot; librarian. When he grabs her and claims to be her husband, she screams and runs away.

George races back to the bridge and begs for his life back. With his wish granted, he rushes home to await his arrest. Mary and Billy have rallied the townspeople, who donate more than enough to replace the missing money. Harry arrives and toasts George as &quot;the richest man in town&quot;. Among the donations, George finds a copy of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,&quot; a gift from Clarence inscribed, &quot;Remember, no man is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings!&quot; When a bell on the Christmas tree rings, George&#x27;s youngest daughter, Zuzu, explains that, &quot;every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings&quot;, while all sing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.

==Production==
===Background===

The original story, &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;, was written by Philip Van Doren Stern in November 1939. After it was rejected by several publishers, he had it printed as a 24-page pamphlet and mailed to 200 family members and friends for Christmas 1943. The story came to the attention of either Cary Grant or RKO producer David Hempstead, who showed it to Grant&#x27;s agent. In April 1944, RKO Pictures bought the rights to the story for $10,000, hoping to turn it into a vehicle for Grant.

Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Marc Connelly each worked on versions of the screenplay before RKO shelved the project. In Trumbo&#x27;s draft, George Bailey is an idealistic politician who grows more cynical as the story progresses, then tries to end his life after losing an election. The angel shows him Bedford Falls not as it would be if he had never been born, but if he had gone into business instead of politics. Grant went on to make another Christmas movie staple, &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;.

RKO studio chief Charles Koerner urged Frank Capra to read &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;. Capra&#x27;s new production company, Liberty Films, had a nine-film distribution agreement with RKO. Capra immediately saw its potential, and wanted it for his first Hollywood film after making documentaries and training films during the war. RKO sold Capra the rights for $10,000 and threw in the three earlier scripts for free. (Capra claimed the rights and the scripts cost him $50,000.) Capra salvaged a few scenes from Odets&#x27; earlier screenplay and worked with writers Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, Jo Swerling, Michael Wilson, and Dorothy Parker (brought in to &quot;polish&quot; the script), on many drafts of the screenplay.

It was not a harmonious collaboration. Goodrich called Capra &quot;that horrid man&quot; and recalled, &quot;He couldn&#x27;t wait to get writing it himself.&quot; Her husband, Albert Hackett, said, &quot;We told him what we were going to do, and he said &#x27;That sounds fine.&#x27; We were trying to move the story along and work it out, and then somebody told us that [Capra] and Jo Swerling were working on it together, and that sort of took the guts out of it. Jo Swerling was a very close friend of ours, and when we heard he was doing this we felt rather bad about it. We were getting near the end and word came that Capra wanted to know how soon we&#x27;d be finished. So my wife said, &#x27;We&#x27;re finished right now.&#x27; We quickly wrote out the last scene and we never saw him again after that. He&#x27;s a very arrogant son of a bitch.&quot;

Later, a dispute ensued over the writing credits. The final screenplay, renamed by Capra &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, was credited to Goodrich, Hackett, and Capra, with &quot;additional scenes&quot; by Jo Swerling. Capra said, &quot;The Screen Writers&#x27; Arbitration committee decided that Hackett and Goodrich and I should get the credit for the writing. Jo Swerling hasn&#x27;t talked to me since. That was five years ago.&quot;

Some in Seneca Falls, New York, believe Capra was inspired to model Bedford Falls after the town following a visit in 1945. The town has an annual &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life Festival&quot; on the second weekend in December. On December 10, 2010, the &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; Museum opened in Seneca Falls, with Karolyn Grimes, who played Zuzu in the movie, cutting the ribbon. However, film historian Jeanine Basinger, curator of the Frank Capra archives at Wesleyan University and author of &quot;The &#x27;It&#x27;s A Wonderful Life&#x27; Book&quot;, has said no evidence exists for Seneca Falls&#x27; claim. &quot;I have been through every piece of paper in Frank Capra&#x27;s diaries, his archives, everything. There&#x27;s no evidence of any sort whatsoever to support this. That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t true, but no one is ever going to prove it.&quot; Basinger said that Capra always described Bedford Falls as an &quot;Everytown&quot;.

Philip Van Doren Stern said in a 1946 interview, &quot;Incidentally, the movie takes place in Westchester County. Actually, the town I had in mind was Califon, N.J.&quot; The historic iron bridge in Califon is similar to the bridge that George Bailey considered jumping from in the movie.

===Casting===
In his autobiography, Capra recalled: &quot;Of all actors&#x27; roles I believe the most difficult is the role of a Good Sam who doesn&#x27;t know that he is a Good Sam. I knew one man who could play it ... James Stewart. ... I spoke to Lew Wasserman, the MCA agent who handled Jimmy, told him I wanted to tell Jimmy the story. Wasserman said Stewart would gladly play the part without hearing the story.&quot; Stewart and Capra had previously collaborated on &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938) and &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939).

Henry Fonda, Stewart&#x27;s best friend, was also considered. Both actors had returned from the war with no employment prospects. Fonda, however, was cast in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), which was filmed at the same time that Capra shot &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life.&quot; For 17 supporting roles in the film, Capra considered more than 170 established actors.

Jean Arthur, Stewart&#x27;s co-star in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot; and &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,&quot; was first offered the role of Mary, but had recently dropped out of the Broadway show &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; from exhaustion shortly before its premiere. Capra next considered Olivia de Havilland, Martha Scott, Ann Dvorak, and Ginger Rogers before borrowing Donna Reed from MGM. Rogers turned it down because she considered it &quot;too bland.&quot; In chapter 26 of her autobiography &quot;Ginger: My Story,&quot; she questioned her decision by asking her readers: &quot;Foolish, you say?&quot;

 A long list of actors was considered for the role of Potter (originally named Herbert Potter): Edward Arnold, Charles Bickford, Edgar Buchanan, Louis Calhern, Victor Jory, Raymond Massey, Thomas Mitchell, and Vincent Price. Lionel Barrymore, who eventually was cast, was a famous Ebenezer Scrooge in radio dramatizations of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; at the time, and was a natural choice for the role. Barrymore had also worked with Capra and Stewart on Capra&#x27;s 1938 Best Picture Oscar winner, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You.&quot;

Before Capra decided on Ward Bond as Bert, he also considered Sam Levene, Barton MacLane, Robert Mitchum, John Alexander and Irving Bacon for the role.

Before Capra cast Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, he also considered Walter Brennan and W. C. Fields for the role.

H. B. Warner, who was cast as Mr. Gower, the pharmacist, had studied medicine before going into acting. He was also in some of Capra&#x27;s other films, including &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,&quot; &quot;Lost Horizon,&quot; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You,&quot; and &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.&quot; In the silent era, he had played the role of Jesus Christ in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The King of Kings&quot; (1927). The name Gower came from Capra&#x27;s employer Columbia Pictures, which had been located on Gower Street for many years. Also on Gower Street was a drugstore that was a favorite for the studio&#x27;s employees.

Charles Williams, who was cast as Eustace Bailey, and Mary Treen, who was cast as Matilda &quot;Tilly&quot; Bailey, were both B-list actors, having appeared in 90 films each before &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life.&quot;

Jimmy the raven (Uncle Billy&#x27;s pet) appeared in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; and each subsequent Capra film.

===Filming===

&quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; was shot at RKO Radio Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, and the 89-acre RKO movie ranch in Encino, where &quot;Bedford Falls&quot; was adapted from Oscar-winning sets originally designed by art director Max Ree for the 1931 epic film &quot;Cimarron.&quot; Covering 4 acres (1.6 ha), the town consisted of a main street stretching 300 yards (three city blocks) with 75 stores and buildings, and a residential neighborhood. Capra added a tree-lined center parkway, built a working bank set, and planted 20 full-grown oak trees. Pigeons, cats, and dogs were allowed to roam the mammoth set to give the &quot;town&quot; a lived-in feel.

Due to the requirements of filming in an &quot;alternate reality,&quot; as well as different seasons, the exterior set was extremely adaptable. RKO studio&#x27;s head of special effects, Russell Shearman, developed a new compound using water, soap flakes, foamite, and sugar to create &quot;chemical snow&quot; for the film. Before then, movie snow was usually made from untoasted cornflakes, which were so loud when stepped on that dialogue had to be redubbed afterwards.

Filming started on April 15, 1946, and wrapped on July 27, 1946, exactly on deadline for the 90-day principal photography schedule.

Only two locations from the film survive. The first, the swimming pool that was unveiled during the high-school dance sequence, is located in the gymnasium at Beverly Hills High School and is still in use . The second is the &quot;Martini home&quot; in La Cañada Flintridge, California. RKO&#x27;s movie ranch in Encino was razed in 1954.

The scene where young George saves his brother Harry from drowning was different in an early draft of the script. The boys play ice hockey on the river (which is on Potter&#x27;s property) as Potter watches with disdain. George shoots the puck, but it goes astray and breaks the &quot;No Trespassing&quot; sign and lands in Potter&#x27;s yard. Potter becomes irate and his gardener releases attack dogs, which cause the boys to flee. Harry falls in the ice and George saves him with the same results.

In another draft, after he unsuccessfully attempts to consult his father about Mr. Gower and the pills, George considers asking Uncle Billy, but he is on the phone with the bank examiner. Billy lights his cigar and throws his match in the wastebasket. George turns to Tilly (who, along with Eustace, are his cousins, although not Billy&#x27;s kids), but she is on the phone with her friend, Martha. She says, &quot;Potter&#x27;s here, the bank examiner&#x27;s coming. It&#x27;s a day of judgment.&quot; The wastebasket suddenly catches fire and Billy cries for help. Tilly runs in and puts the fire out with a pot of coffee. George decides to deal with the Gower situation by himself.

According to Bobbie Anderson, in the confrontation between Mr. Gower and young George, H. B. Warner, who was drunk at the time of the drug store scene, slapped him for real and made his ear bleed, reducing him to tears. Warner hugged him after the scene was shot.
Composer Dimitri Tiomkin had written &quot;Death Telegram&quot; and &quot;Gower&#x27;s Deliverance&quot; for the drugstore sequence, but Capra elected to forgo music in those scenes. Tiomkin had worked on many of Capra&#x27;s previous films, but those changes, and others, led to a falling out between the two men. Tiomkin felt as though his work was being seen as a mere suggestion. In his autobiography &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Hate Me,&quot; he called the incident, &quot;an all around scissors job.&quot;

In the scene where Uncle Billy gets drunk at Harry and Ruth&#x27;s welcome home/newlyweds&#x27; party and staggers away off camera, a crash is heard off screen. Mitchell, as Uncle Billy, yells, &quot;I&#x27;m all right! I&#x27;m all right!&quot;, implying that Uncle Billy had knocked into some trash cans. A technician had actually knocked over some equipment; Capra left in Mitchell&#x27;s impromptu ad lib and rewarded the technician with $10 (equal to $141.84 in 2021), thanking him for his &#x27;sound improvement.&#x27;

According to rare stills that have been unearthed, several sequences were filmed but subsequently cut. Alternative endings were also considered. Capra&#x27;s first script had Bailey fall to his knees to recite &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (the script also called for an opening scene with the townspeople in prayer). Feeling that an overly religious tone undermined the emotional impact of the family and friends rushing to George&#x27;s rescue, the closing scenes were rewritten.

Capra found the film&#x27;s original cinematographer Victor Milner slow and pretentious, and when Milner became ill, Capra borrowed Joseph Walker from Columbia. Walker had lensed 19 previous Capra films. But when Rosalind Russell demanded that Walker return to Columbia Pictures to shoot her next film, Walker trained veteran camera operator Joseph Biroc to be his replacement. Although working with three cinematographers was difficult for Capra, in Walker&#x27;s opinion it turned out very well because the scenes each cinematographer shot were so different that they did not have to match each other&#x27;s visual styles.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

According to a 2006 book, &quot;A spate of movies appeared just after the ending of the Second World War, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) and &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (1946), perhaps tapping into so many people&#x27;s experience of loss of loved ones and offering a kind of consolation.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; premiered at the Globe Theatre in New York City on December 20, 1946, to mixed reviews. While Capra thought the contemporary critical reviews were either universally negative, or at best dismissive, &quot;Time&quot; said, &quot;&quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; is a pretty wonderful movie. It has only one formidable rival (Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;) as Hollywood&#x27;s best picture of the year. Director Capra&#x27;s inventiveness, humor, and affection for human beings keep it glowing with life and excitement.&quot;

In his review for Variety, Bert Briller wrote, &quot;&quot;It’s a Wonderful Life&quot; will enjoy just that at the b.o. [box office], and eminently deserves to do so.&quot; He added: &quot;Capra may not have taken here the stride forward in film-making technique he achieved in “&quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, but no past Capra celluloid possessed any greater or more genuine qualities of effectiveness.&quot; Briller praised Reed&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;In femme lead, Donna Reed will reach full-fledged stardom with this effort.&quot;

Bosley Crowther, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, complimented some of the actors, including Stewart and Reed, but concluded, &quot;the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer&#x27;s point of view, is the sentimentality of it—its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra&#x27;s nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow, they all resemble theatrical attitudes, rather than average realities.&quot;

The film, which went into general release on January 7, 1947, placed 26th ($3.3 million) in box-office revenues for 1947 (out of more than 400 features released), one place ahead of another Christmas film, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. The film was supposed to be released in January 1947, but was moved up to December 1946 to make it eligible for the 19th Academy Awards held in March 1947. This move was seen as worse for the film, as 1947 did not have quite the stiff competition as 1946. If it had entered the 1947 awards, its strongest competitor would have been &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. The number-one grossing movie of 1947, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, made $11.5 million.

The film recorded a loss of $525,000 at the box office for RKO.

On May 26, 1947, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a memo stating, &quot;With regard to the picture &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, [redacted] stated in substance that the film represented rather obvious attempts to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a &#x27;scrooge-type&#x27; so that he would be the most hated man in the picture. This, according to these sources, is a common trick used by Communists. [In] addition, [redacted] stated that, in his opinion, this picture deliberately maligned the upper class, attempting to show the people who had money were mean and despicable characters.&quot; Film historian Andrew Sarris observed as &quot;curious&quot; that &quot;the censors never noticed that the villainous Mr. Potter gets away with robbery without being caught or punished in any way&quot;.
In 1990, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.

In 2002, Channel 4 in the United Kingdom ranked &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; as the seventh-greatest film ever made in its poll &quot;The 100 Greatest Films&quot;. The channel airs the film to British viewers annually on Christmas Eve.

In June 2008, AFI revealed its &quot;10 Top 10&quot;, the best 10 films in 10 &quot;classic&quot; American film genres, after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; was acknowledged as the third-best film in the fantasy genre.

Somewhat more iconoclastic views of the film and its contents are occasionally expressed. In his review for &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1947, film critic Manny Farber wrote, &quot;To make his points, [Capra] always takes an easy, simple-minded path that doesn&#x27;t give much credit to the intelligence of the audience&quot;, and adds that it has only a &quot;few unsentimental moments here and there&quot;. Wendell Jamieson, in a 2008 article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; which was generally positive in its analysis of the film, observed that far from being simply a sweetly sentimental tale, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; &quot;is a terrifying, asphyxiating story about growing up and relinquishing your dreams, of seeing your father driven to the grave before his time, of living among bitter, small-minded people. It is a story of being trapped, of compromising, of watching others move ahead and away, of becoming so filled with rage that you verbally abuse your children, their teacher, and your oppressively perfect wife.&quot;

In a 2010 essay for &quot;Salon&quot;, Richard Cohen described &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; as &quot;the most terrifying Hollywood film ever made&quot;. In the &quot;Pottersville&quot; sequence, he wrote, George Bailey is not seeing the world that would exist had he never been born, but rather &quot;the world as it does exist, in his time and also in our own&quot;. Nine years earlier, another &quot;Salon&quot; writer, Gary Kamiya, had expressed the opposing view that &quot;Pottersville &quot;rocks!&quot;&quot;, adding: &quot;The gauzy, Currier-and-Ives veil Capra drapes over Bedford Falls has prevented viewers from grasping what a tiresome and, frankly, toxic environment it is ... We all live in Pottersville now.&quot;

The film&#x27;s elevation to the status of a beloved classic came three decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in 1976. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. &quot;It&#x27;s the damnedest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, Capra told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1984. &quot;The film has a life of its own now, and I can look at it like I had nothing to do with it. I&#x27;m like a parent whose kid grows up to be President. I&#x27;m proud ... but it&#x27;s the kid who did the work. I didn&#x27;t even think of it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea.&quot; In a 1946 interview, Capra described the film&#x27;s theme as &quot;the individual&#x27;s belief in himself&quot; and that he made it &quot;to combat a modern trend toward atheism&quot;. It ranked 283rd among critics, and 107th among directors, in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made.

The film&#x27;s positive reception has continued. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 97 reviews, with an average rating of 9.0/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The holiday classic to define all holiday classics, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; is one of a handful of films worth an annual viewing.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a score 89 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Many filmmakers have praised the film, including Steven Spielberg, Akira Kurosawa, Frank Darabont, David Lynch, and Guillermo del Toro. Spielberg once said of the film: &quot;&quot;It’s a Wonderful Life&quot; shows that every human being on this Earth matters – and that’s a very powerful message.&quot; Orson Welles played Mr. Potter in the made-for-television remake &quot;It Happened One Christmas&quot;; when asked by Henry Jaglom what he thought of the movie, Welles said, &quot;There&#x27;s no way of hating that movie.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Prior to its Los Angeles release, Liberty Films mounted an extensive promotional campaign that included a daily advertisement highlighting one of the film&#x27;s players, along with comments from reviewers. Jimmy Starr wrote, &quot;If I were an Oscar, I&#x27;d elope with &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; lock, stock and barrel on the night of the Academy Awards&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily Times&quot; published an editorial that declared the film and James Stewart&#x27;s performance to be worthy of Academy Award consideration.

&quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; received five Academy Award nominations:

&quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, a drama about servicemen attempting to return to their pre-World War II lives, won most of the awards that year, including four of the five for which &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; was nominated. (The award for &quot;Best Sound Recording&quot; was won by &quot;The Jolson Story&quot;.) &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives,&quot; directed by William Wyler, Capra&#x27;s business partner along with George Stevens in Liberty Films, was also an outstanding commercial success, ultimately becoming the highest-grossing film of the decade, in contrast to the more modest initial box-office returns of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

&quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; received a Golden Globe Award for Capra as Best Motion Picture Director. He also won a &quot;CEC Award&quot; from the Cinema Writers Circle in Spain, for &quot;Mejor Película Extranjera&quot; (Best Foreign Film). Jimmy Hawkins won a &quot;Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; from the Young Artist Awards in 1994; the award recognized his role as Tommy Bailey as igniting his career, which lasted until the mid-1960s.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Values&quot;.

==Release==
===Ownership and copyright issues===

Liberty Films was purchased by Paramount Pictures, and remained a subsidiary until 1951. In 1955, M. &amp; A. Alexander purchased the movie. This included key rights to the original television syndication, the original nitrate film elements, the music score, and the film rights to the story on which the film is based, &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;. National Telefilm Associates (NTA) took over the rights to the film soon thereafter.

A clerical error at NTA prevented the copyright from being renewed properly in 1974. Despite the lapsed copyright, television stations that aired it still had to pay royalties because—though the film&#x27;s images had entered the public domain—the film&#x27;s story was still restricted as a derivative work of the published story &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;, the copyright of which Philip Van Doren Stern had renewed in 1971. The film became a perennial holiday favorite in the 1980s, possibly due to its repeated showings each holiday season on hundreds of local television stations. It was mentioned during the deliberations on the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998.

In 1993, Republic Pictures, which was the successor to NTA, relied on the 1990 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Stewart v. Abend&quot; (which involved another Stewart film, &quot;Rear Window&quot;) to enforce its claim to the copyright. While the film&#x27;s copyright had not been renewed, Republic still owned the film rights to &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;; thus, the plaintiffs were able to argue its status as a derivative work of a work still under copyright. That year, Republic made a deal with Turner Broadcasting System, authorizing only three airings of the movie, all on cable&#x27;s TNT and TBS. However, the studio&#x27;s attempt to reassert control was widely ignored since there were still some existing distribution deals that Republic had to honor.

In 1994, the studio sold exclusive television rights to NBC. &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled that we will have the opportunity to broadcast this picture,&quot; said NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield at the time. &quot;We will broadcast the original director&#x27;s cut in black and white, full-length, the way Frank Capra intended this picture to be seen.&quot;

NBC traditionally shows the film on Christmas Eve. It had, for a time in the late 1990s, aired the film on Thanksgiving but removed that airing due to low ratings and began airing the National Dog Show instead. Paramount (via parent company Viacom&#x27;s 1998 acquisition of Republic&#x27;s then-parent, Spelling Entertainment) once again has distribution rights for the first time since 1955.

===Colorization===
Capra met with Wilson Markle about having Colorization Inc. colorize &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; based on an enthusiastic response to the colorization of &quot;Topper&quot; from actor Cary Grant. The company&#x27;s art director, Brian Holmes, prepared 10 minutes of colorized footage from &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; for Capra to view, which resulted in Capra signing a contract with Colorization Inc., and his &quot;enthusiastic agree[ment] to pay half the $260,000 cost of colorizing the movie and to share any profits&quot; and giving &quot;preliminary approval to making similar color versions of two of his other black-and-white films, &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; (1941) and &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; (1933)&quot;.

However, the film was believed to be in the public domain at the time, and as a result, Markle and Holmes responded by returning Capra&#x27;s initial investment, eliminating his financial participation, and refusing outright to allow the director to exercise artistic control over the colorization of his films, leading Capra to join in the campaign against the process.

Three colorized versions have been produced. The first was released by Hal Roach Studios in 1986. The second was authorized and produced by the film&#x27;s permanent owner, Republic Pictures, in 1989. Both Capra and Stewart took a critical stand on the colorized editions. The Hal Roach color version was re-released in 1989 to VHS via Video Treasures. A third, computer-colorized version was produced by Legend Films in 2007 and has been released on DVD, Blu-ray, and streaming services.

==Home media==
===VHS===
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, when the film was still thought to be public domain, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; was released on VHS by a variety of home video companies. Among the companies that released the film on home video before Republic Pictures stepped in were Meda Video (which would later become Media Home Entertainment), Kartes Video Communications (under its Video Film Classics label), GoodTimes Home Video, and Video Treasures (now Anchor Bay Entertainment). After Republic reclaimed the rights to the film, all unofficial VHS copies of the film still in the hands of video distributors were supposed to have been destroyed.

Artisan Entertainment (under license from Republic) took over home video rights in the mid-1990s. Artisan was later sold to Lions Gate Entertainment, which continued to hold US home video rights until late 2005, when they reverted to Paramount, which also owns video rights throughout Region 4 (Latin America and Australia) and in France. Video rights in the rest of the world are held by different companies; for example, the UK rights were once with Universal Studios, but have since reverted to Paramount.

====Technological first: CD-ROM====
In 1993, due in part to the confusion of the ownership and copyright issues, Kinesoft Development, with the support of Republic Pictures, released &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; as one of the first commercial feature-length films on CD-ROM for the Windows PC (Windows 3.1). Antedating commercial DVDs by several years, it included such features as the ability to follow along with the complete shooting script as the film was playing.

Given the state of video playback on the PC at the time of its release, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; for Windows represented another milestone, as the longest-running video on a computer. Prior to its release, Windows could play back only about 32,000 frames of video, or about 35 minutes at 15 frames per second. Working with Microsoft, Kinesoft was able to enhance the video features of Windows to allow for the complete playback of the entire film—all of this on a PC with a 486SX processor and 8 MB of RAM.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said in April 1994, &quot;The picture quality still has a way to go before it reaches television standards&quot;, but was &quot;a noble effort&quot; that would &quot;please fans of the film&quot;.

===DVD and Blu-ray===
The film has seen multiple DVD releases since the availability of the format. In the autumn of 2001,in 2002 in Australia by magna pacific and mra entertainment in 2004,Republic issued the film twice, once in August, and again with different packaging in September of that same year. On October 31, 2006, Paramount released a newly remastered &quot;60th Anniversary Edition&quot;. On November 13, 2007, Paramount released a two-disc &quot;special edition&quot; DVD of the film that contained both the original theatrical black-and-white version, and a new, third colorized version, produced by Legend Films using the latest colorization technology. On November 3, 2009, Paramount re-released the previous DVD set as a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; and debuted a Blu-ray edition, also containing both versions of the film.

===Restoration===
In 2017, the film was restored in 4K resolution, available via streaming services and DCP.

===4K Ultra HD Blu-ray===
On October 29, 2019, the film was released for the first time on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, along with a digital copy featuring a new Dolby Vision transfer.

==Adaptations in other media==

The film was twice adapted for radio in 1947, first on &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; (March 10) and then on &quot;the Screen Guild Theater&quot; (December 29), then again on the &quot;Screen Guild Theater&quot; broadcast of March 15, 1951. James Stewart and Donna Reed reprised their roles for all three radio productions. Stewart also starred in the May 8, 1949, radio adaptation presented on the &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;.

A musical stage adaptation of the film, titled &quot;A Wonderful Life&quot;, was written by Sheldon Harnick and Joe Raposo. This version was first performed at the University of Michigan in 1986, but a planned professional production was stalled by legal wrangling with the estate of Philip Van Doren Stern. It was eventually performed in Washington, D.C., by Arena Stage in 1991, and had revivals in the 21st century, including a staged concert version in New York City in 2005 and several productions by regional theatres.

Another musical stage adaptation of the film, titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life – The Musical&quot;, was written by Bruce Greer and Keith Ferguson. This version premiered at the Majestic Theatre, Dallas, Texas, in 1998. It was an annual Christmas show at the theater for five years. It has since been performed at venues all around the United States.

In July 2019, it was revealed that another stage musical adaptation was in development with music and lyrics by Paul McCartney (making his musical theatre debut), lyrics and book by Lee Hall and produced by Bill Kenwright. The musical was set to debut late 2020, but is still yet to premiere.

In 1997, PBS aired &quot;Merry Christmas, George Bailey&quot;, taped from a live performance of the 1947 &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; script at the Pasadena Playhouse. The presentation, which benefited the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, featured an all-star cast, including Bill Pullman as George, Nathan Lane as Clarence, Martin Landau as Mr. Potter, Penelope Ann Miller as Mary, and Sally Field as Mother Bailey.

&quot;The Last Temptation of Clarence Odbody&quot; is a 2011 novel written by John Pierson. The novel imagines the future lives of various characters if George had not survived his jump into the river.

A new &quot;cinematic audio&quot; adaptation by David Ossman of the Firesign Theatre was produced and directed by Ossman and his wife Judith Walcutt of Otherworld Media in December 2019 at the Whidbey Island Center for the Arts. Their version combined elements of traditional and radio theatre, with costumes, sets, makeup, and lighting effects, as well as live music, live sound effects, and over 20 microphones.

===Remakes===
&quot;It Happened One Christmas&quot; was a 1977 television movie remake of the classic film, the screenplay of which Lionel Chetwynd based on both the original Van Doren Stern short story and the 1946 screenplay. This remake employed gender-reversal, with Marlo Thomas as the protagonist Mary Bailey, Wayne Rogers as George Hatch, and Cloris Leachman as the angel Clara Oddbody. Leachman received her tenth Emmy nomination for this role. Orson Welles was cast as Mr. Potter. Following initial positive reviews, the made-for-television film was rebroadcast twice in 1978 and 1979, but has not been shown since on national re-broadcasts or issued to home media.

&quot;Merry Christmas, George Bailey&quot; was a 1997 PBS television movie adaptation of the film directed by Matthew Diamond and starring Bill Pullman as George Bailey, Penelope Ann Miller as Mary, Nathan Lane as Clarence and Martin Landau as Potter.

&quot;The Christmas Spirit&quot; was a retelling of the movie starring Nicollette Sheridan as Charlotte Hart. This was a made-for-TV film aired on December 1, 2013, on the Hallmark Channel executive produced by Sheridan under her company, Wyke Lane Productions, and Brad Krevoy Television. The film was directed and written by Jack Angelo. &quot;Spirit&quot; was set in the present day, with the Hart character working to save a &quot;quiet New England town from a ruthless real estate developer&quot;. The film was planned to kick off a film series about the Hart character. The film had 3.372 million viewers overall.

===Parodies and references===
A 1986 skit on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; features William Shatner introducing the &quot;lost ending&quot; of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; in which George Bailey (Dana Carvey) and the citizens of Bedford Falls discover that Mr. Potter (Jon Lovitz) has stolen George&#x27;s money and take turns attacking him in his office.

In 1992, the final episode of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; parodied &quot;It&#x27;s A Wonderful Life&quot; entitled &quot;It&#x27;s A Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas&quot;. In it, Buster Bunny feels sad after the failure of his play and wishes he had never become a Tiny Toon, so a guardian angel shows Buster what life would have been like without him.

In 2002, the television film &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; premiered on NBC. The film is a homage to &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. In the film, Kermit the Frog wishes that he had never been born.

&quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;, the 2011 &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; season 3 Christmas episode, tells a similar story after agent Pete Lattimer touches Stern&#x27;s brush.

===Sequel===

In 1990, the made-for-television film &quot;Clarence&quot; stars Robert Carradine in a new tale of the helpful angel, Clarence Odbody.

===Cancelled sequel===
A purported sequel was in development for a 2015 release, and was to be called &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life: The Rest of the Story&quot;. It was to be written by Bob Farnsworth and Martha Bolton and follow the angel of George Bailey&#x27;s daughter Zuzu (played once again by Karolyn Grimes), as she teaches Bailey&#x27;s evil grandson how different the world would have been if he had never been born. Producers were considering directors and hoped to shoot the film with a $25–$35 million budget in Louisiana early in 2014.

The film had been announced as being produced by Star Partners and Hummingbird Productions, neither of which are affiliated with Paramount, owners of the original film (Farnsworth claimed that &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; was in the public domain). Later, a Paramount spokesperson claimed that they were not granting permission to make the film; &quot;To date, these individuals have not obtained any of the necessary rights, and we would take all appropriate steps to protect those rights&quot;, the spokesperson said.

===Modern remake===
On January 19, 2024, it was announced that Kenya Barris will write and direct a modern remake of the film for Paramount, with the intention to cast a person of color in the role of George Bailey. On the announcement, Barris remarked: &quot;I feel like Christmas movies are amazing and I think the idea of taking something that has that long of a history and a tale behind it and putting an amazing piece of talent to tell that story ... It&#x27;s a guy who’s trying to help out his community and things are going to turn around on him. I think that’s the perfect story to tell for a person of color — Black or brown — to get into that because our communities have some issues and someone trying to help that community out. I think that’s the perfect vehicle to tell that story from.&quot;

==&quot;Sesame Street&quot; urban legend==
It is commonly believed that the characters of Bert and Ernie on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; were named after Bert the cop and Ernie the cab driver. However, in a correction for the 1999 &quot;Annual Xmas Quiz&quot; in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, which made this claim, series writer Jerry Juhl confirmed that, per producer Jon Stone, the shared names were merely a coincidence. Despite this, the 1996 holiday special &quot;Elmo Saves Christmas&quot; references the rumor, during a scene where Bert and Ernie walk by a TV set, which is playing the movie. The pair are surprised by the line: &quot;Bert! Ernie! What&#x27;s the matter with you two guys? You were here on my wedding night!&quot;

==Stephan&#x27;s Quintet usage==
The angelic figures depicted at the beginning of the film is an image of Stephan&#x27;s Quintet, a group of five interacting galaxies.

<doc id="60167" wikidata="Q202785" url="?curid=60167" title="Average">
<text>In ordinary language, an average is a single number or value that best represents a set of data. The type of average taken as most typically representative of a list of numbers is the arithmetic mean the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are in the list. For example, the mean or average of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 (summing to 25) is 5. Depending on the context, the most representative statistic to be taken as the average might be another measure of central tendency, such as the mid-range, median, mode or geometric mean. For example, the average personal income is often given as the median the number below which are 50% of personal incomes and above which are 50% of personal incomes because the mean would be higher by including personal incomes from a few billionaires.

==General properties==
If all numbers in a list are the same number, then their average is also equal to this number. This property is shared by each of the many types of average.

Another universal property is monotonicity: if two lists of numbers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have the same length, and each entry of list &quot;A&quot; is at least as large as the corresponding entry on list &quot;B&quot;, then the average of list &quot;A&quot; is at least that of list &quot;B&quot;. Also, all averages satisfy linear homogeneity: if all numbers of a list are multiplied by the same positive number, then its average changes by the same factor.

In some types of average, the items in the list are assigned different weights before the average is determined. These include the weighted arithmetic mean, the weighted geometric mean and the weighted median. Also, for some types of moving average, the weight of an item depends on its position in the list. Most types of average, however, satisfy permutation-insensitivity: all items count equally in determining their average value and their positions in the list are irrelevant; the average of (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) is the same as that of (3, 2, 6, 4, 1).

==Pythagorean means==

The arithmetic mean, the geometric mean and the harmonic mean are known collectively as the &quot;Pythagorean means&quot;.

==Statistical location==
The mode, the median, and the mid-range are often used in addition to the mean as estimates of central tendency in descriptive statistics. These can all be seen as minimizing variation by some measure; see .

===Mode===

The most frequently occurring number in a list is called the mode. For example, the mode of the list (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4) is 3. It may happen that there are two or more numbers which occur equally often and more often than any other number. In this case there is no agreed definition of mode. Some authors say they are all modes and some say there is no mode.

===Median===
The median is the middle number of the group when they are ranked in order. (If there are an even number of numbers, the mean of the middle two is taken.)

Thus to find the median, order the list according to its elements&#x27; magnitude and then repeatedly remove the pair consisting of the highest and lowest values until either one or two values are left. If exactly one value is left, it is the median; if two values, the median is the arithmetic mean of these two. This method takes the list 1, 7, 3, 13 and orders it to read 1, 3, 7, 13. Then the 1 and 13 are removed to obtain the list 3, 7. Since there are two elements in this remaining list, the median is their arithmetic mean, (3 + 7)/2 = 5.

===Mid-range===
The mid-range is the arithmetic mean of the highest and lowest values of a set.

==Summary of types==


Even though perhaps not an average, the formula_1th quantile (another summary statistic that generalizes the median) can similarly be expressed as a solution to the optimization problem

:formula_2,

which aims to minimize the total tilted absolute value loss (or &quot;quantile&quot; loss or &quot;pinball&quot; loss).

The table of mathematical symbols explains the symbols used below.

==Miscellaneous types==
Other more sophisticated averages are: trimean, trimedian, and normalized mean, with their generalizations.

One can create one&#x27;s own average metric using the generalized &quot;f&quot;-mean:

: formula_3

where &quot;f&quot; is any invertible function. The harmonic mean is an example of this using &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1/&quot;x&quot;, and the geometric mean is another, using &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = log &quot;x&quot;.

However, this method for generating means is not general enough to capture all averages. A more general method for defining an average takes any function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) of a list of arguments that is continuous, strictly increasing in each argument, and symmetric (invariant under permutation of the arguments). The average &quot;y&quot; is then the value that, when replacing each member of the list, results in the same function value: . This most general definition still captures the important property of all averages that the average of a list of identical elements is that element itself. The function provides the arithmetic mean. The function (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the geometric mean. The function (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the harmonic mean.

===Average percentage return and CAGR===
A type of average used in finance is the average percentage return. It is an example of a geometric mean. When the returns are annual, it is called the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). For example, if we are considering a period of two years, and the investment return in the first year is −10% and the return in the second year is +60%, then the average percentage return or CAGR, &quot;R&quot;, can be obtained by solving the equation: . The value of &quot;R&quot; that makes this equation true is 0.2, or 20%. This means that the total return over the 2-year period is the same as if there had been 20% growth each year. The order of the years makes no difference – the average percentage returns of +60% and −10% is the same result as that for −10% and +60%.

This method can be generalized to examples in which the periods are not equal. For example, consider a period of a half of a year for which the return is −23% and a period of two and a half years for which the return is +13%. The average percentage return for the combined period is the single year return, &quot;R&quot;, that is the solution of the following equation: , giving an average return &quot;R&quot; of 0.0600 or 6.00%.

==Moving average==
Given a time series, such as daily stock market prices or yearly temperatures, people often want to create a smoother series. This helps to show underlying trends or perhaps periodic behavior. An easy way to do this is the &quot;moving average&quot;: one chooses a number &quot;n&quot; and creates a new series by taking the arithmetic mean of the first &quot;n&quot; values, then moving forward one place by dropping the oldest value and introducing a new value at the other end of the list, and so on. This is the simplest form of moving average. More complicated forms involve using a weighted average. The weighting can be used to enhance or suppress various periodic behavior and there is very extensive analysis of what weightings to use in the literature on filtering. In digital signal processing the term &quot;moving average&quot; is used even when the sum of the weights is not 1.0 (so the output series is a scaled version of the averages). The reason for this is that the analyst is usually interested only in the trend or the periodic behavior.

==History==

===Origin===
The first recorded time that the arithmetic mean was extended from 2 to n cases for the use of estimation was in the sixteenth century. From the late sixteenth century onwards, it gradually became a common method to use for reducing errors of measurement in various areas. At the time, astronomers wanted to know a real value from noisy measurement, such as the position of a planet or the diameter of the moon. Using the mean of several measured values, scientists assumed that the errors add up to a relatively small number when compared to the total of all measured values. The method of taking the mean for reducing observation errors was indeed mainly developed in astronomy. A possible precursor to the arithmetic mean is the mid-range (the mean of the two extreme values), used for example in Arabian astronomy of the ninth to eleventh centuries, but also in metallurgy and navigation.

However, there are various older vague references to the use of the arithmetic mean (which are not as clear, but might reasonably have to do with our modern definition of the mean). In a text from the 4th century, it was written that (text in square brackets is a possible missing text that might clarify the meaning):
: In the first place, we must set out in a row the sequence of numbers from the monad up to nine: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Then we must add up the amount of all of them together, and since the row contains nine terms, we must look for the ninth part of the total to see if it is already naturally present among the numbers in the row; and we will find that the property of being [one] ninth [of the sum] only belongs to the [arithmetic] mean itself...

Even older potential references exist. There are records that from about 700 BC, merchants and shippers agreed that damage to the cargo and ship (their &quot;contribution&quot; in case of damage by the sea) should be shared equally among themselves. This might have been calculated using the average, although there seem to be no direct record of the calculation.

===Etymology===
The root is found in Arabic as عوار &quot;ʿawār&quot;, a defect, or anything defective or damaged, including partially spoiled merchandise; and عواري &quot;ʿawārī&quot; (also عوارة &quot;ʿawāra&quot;) = &quot;of or relating to &quot;ʿawār&quot;, a state of partial damage&quot;. Within the Western languages the word&#x27;s history begins in medieval sea-commerce on the Mediterranean. 12th and 13th century Genoa Latin &quot;avaria&quot; meant &quot;damage, loss and non-normal expenses arising in connection with a merchant sea voyage&quot;; and the same meaning for &quot;avaria&quot; is in Marseille in 1210, Barcelona in 1258 and Florence in the late 13th. 15th-century French &quot;avarie&quot; had the same meaning, and it begot English &quot;averay&quot; (1491) and English &quot;average&quot; (1502) with the same meaning. Today, Italian &quot;avaria&quot;, Catalan &quot;avaria&quot; and French &quot;avarie&quot; still have the primary meaning of &quot;damage&quot;. The huge transformation of the meaning in English began with the practice in later medieval and early modern Western merchant-marine law contracts under which if the ship met a bad storm and some of the goods had to be thrown overboard to make the ship lighter and safer, then all merchants whose goods were on the ship were to suffer proportionately (and not whoever&#x27;s goods were thrown overboard); and more generally there was to be proportionate distribution of any &quot;avaria&quot;. From there the word was adopted by British insurers, creditors, and merchants for talking about their losses as being spread across their whole portfolio of assets and having a mean proportion. Today&#x27;s meaning developed out of that, and started in the mid-18th century, and started in English.

Marine damage is either &quot;particular average&quot;, which is borne only by the owner of the damaged property, or general average, where the owner can claim a proportional contribution from all the parties to the marine venture. The type of calculations used in adjusting general average gave rise to the use of &quot;average&quot; to mean &quot;arithmetic mean&quot;.

A second English usage, documented as early as 1674 and sometimes spelled &quot;averish&quot;, is as the residue and second growth of field crops, which were considered suited to consumption by draught animals (&quot;avers&quot;).

There is earlier (from at least the 11th century), unrelated use of the word. It appears to be an old legal term for a tenant&#x27;s day labour obligation to a sheriff, probably anglicised from &quot;avera&quot; found in the English Domesday Book (1085).

The Oxford English Dictionary, however, says that derivations from German &quot;hafen&quot; haven, and Arabic &quot;ʿawâr&quot; loss, damage, have been &quot;quite disposed of&quot; and the word has a Romance origin.

== Averages as a rhetorical tool ==
Due to the aforementioned colloquial nature of the term &quot;average&quot;, the term can be used to obfuscate the true meaning of data and suggest varying answers to questions based on the averaging method (most frequently arithmetic mean, median, or mode) used. In his article &quot;Framed for Lying: Statistics as In/Artistic Proof&quot;, University of Pittsburgh faculty member Daniel Libertz comments that statistical information is frequently dismissed from rhetorical arguments for this reason. However, due to their persuasive power, averages and other statistical values should not be discarded completely, but instead used and interpreted with caution. Libertz invites us to engage critically not only with statistical information such as averages, but also with the language used to describe the data and its uses, saying: &quot;If statistics rely on interpretation, rhetors should invite their audience to interpret rather than insist on an interpretation.&quot; In many cases, data and specific calculations are provided to help facilitate this audience-based interpretation.

<doc id="60169" wikidata="Q625780" url="?curid=60169" title="The Red Shoes (1948 film)">
<text>The Red Shoes is a 1948 British drama film written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. It follows Victoria Page (Moira Shearer), an aspiring ballerina who joins the world-renowned Ballet Lermontov, owned and operated by Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), who tests her dedication to the ballet by making her choose between her career and her romance with composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring).

It marked the feature film debut of Shearer, an established ballerina, and also features Robert Helpmann, Léonide Massine, and Ludmilla Tchérina, other renowned dancers from the ballet world. The plot is based on the 1845 fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen, and features a ballet within it by the same title, also adapted from the Andersen work.

&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; was filmmaking team Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s tenth collaboration and follow-up to 1947&#x27;s &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;. It had been conceived by Powell and producer Alexander Korda in the 1930s, from whom the duo purchased the rights in 1946. The majority of the cast were professional dancers. Filming of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; took place in mid-1946, primarily in France and England.

Upon release, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; received critical acclaim, especially in the United States, where it received a total of five Academy Award nominations, including a win for Best Original Score and Best Art Direction. It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and was named one of the Top 10 Films of the Year by the National Board of Review. Despite this, some dance critics gave the film unfavourable reviews as they felt its fantastical, impressionistic centrepiece sequence, influenced by German expressionistic cinema of the 1920s, depicted ballet in an unrealistic manner. The film proved a major financial success and was the first British film in history to gross over $5 million in theatrical rentals in the United States.

Retrospectively, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is regarded as one of the best films of Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s partnership and one of the greatest films of all time. It was voted the ninth greatest British film of all time by the British Film Institute in 1999. The film underwent an extensive digital restoration beginning in 2006 at the UCLA Film and Television Archive to correct significant damage to the original negatives. The restored version of the film screened at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and was subsequently issued on Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers, and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine saw it ranked the fifth best British film ever.

==Plot==
London music student Julian Craster attends a performance of the ballet &quot;Heart of Fire&quot;, performed by the eminent travelling ballet company Ballet Lermontov and scored by his professor. Also present are young dancer Victoria &#x27;Vicky&#x27; Page and her aunt Lady Neston. Julian furiously walks out after recognising that the professor has plagiarised his compositions.

Lady Neston hosts an after-party in honour of the Ballet Lermontov&#x27;s impresario, Boris Lermontov. After Vicky tells Boris that dancing is the most important thing in her life, Boris invites her to spend time with his ballet before it leaves for Paris. He hires Vicky full-time after watching her dance the lead in &quot;Swan Lake&quot; with Ballet Rambert at the Mercury Theatre.

Julian angrily writes a letter to Boris exposing his professor&#x27;s misconduct. He has a change of heart and visits Boris to take the letter back, but Boris has already read it and is sympathetic. Boris hires Julian as a répétiteur and assistant to the company&#x27;s conductor. He soon grows impressed with Julian&#x27;s artistic ambition.

In Paris, Ballet Lermontov&#x27;s principal dancer Irina Boronskaya is required to leave the company upon getting married, per company policy. Although Boris&#x27;s official rationale is that that love distracts from artistic excellence, the film also reveals that he takes his coworkers&#x27; emotional lives (which he lacks) as a personal slight, due to his jealousy of their happiness.

The company proceeds to Monaco. In Irina&#x27;s absence, Boris casts Vicky as the lead in a new ballet, &quot;The Ballet of the Red Shoes&quot; (based on the Andersen fairytale), and hires Julian to score it. In the ballet, a dancer acquires a pair of red ballet shoes which enable her to dance with superhuman skill, but at a price: she can never stop dancing until she dies. During rehearsals, Julian and Vicky&#x27;s ambition and pride lead them to clash at first—to Boris&#x27;s glee. However, they develop respect for each other as artists.

&quot;The Ballet of the Red Shoes&quot; is a resounding success. Boris revitalises the company&#x27;s repertoire with Vicky as the prima ballerina and Julian as the star composer. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian fall in love. Although Boris is not romantically attracted to Vicky, he is emotionally possessive of his new star. He tries to break up the relationship by telling them that their work is getting worse, but it is implied that he is projecting his own insecurities onto the relationship, as Boris&#x27;s choreographer is full of praise for Julian. Boris gives Julian an ultimatum to break up with Vicky or leave the company. Julian and Vicky move back to London together and get married. Boris breaks his no-marriage rule to rehire Irina, but cannot mentally let go of Vicky.

In London, Vicky and Julian&#x27;s careers go in different directions. Julian writes an opera that is set to open in Covent Garden, while Vicky&#x27;s ballet career stalls. Vicky goes on holiday to Cannes without Julian, who is focused on his work. Boris meets her there. He reminds Vicky that she is the one making all the sacrifices in her marriage, and persuades her to &quot;put on the red shoes again&quot;.

Coincidentally, the opening night of Julian&#x27;s opera in London falls on the same date as Vicky&#x27;s comeback performance in Monaco. Although Julian is supposed to conduct on opening night, he abruptly leaves for Monaco as a grand gesture for Vicky. In return, he insists that Vicky cancel her performance and leave Monaco and Boris immediately. After Julian and Boris have a heated argument about the value of art versus love, an anguished Vicky chooses to stay with Ballet Lermontov.

An attendant escorts Vicky to the stage. She is wearing the titular red shoes, and looks faint. She suddenly runs off and jumps in front of an oncoming train, paralleling her ill-fated character in the ballet. Julian tries to save her, but cannot. As Vicky dies, she asks Julian to remove the red shoes.

A shaken Boris announces to the audience that &quot;Miss Page is unable to dance tonight—nor indeed any other night&quot;. The company performs &quot;The Ballet of the Red Shoes&quot; with a spotlight on the empty space where Vicky would have been.

==Cast==

==Analysis==
===&quot;Art versus life&quot;===
A central theme to &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is a performer&#x27;s conflict between their art and personal life. Commenting on this theme, Powell himself stated that the film is &quot;about dying for art, that art is worth dying for.&quot; Film scholar Adrienne McLean, however, notes that Victoria&#x27;s final leap to her death does not adequately represent this idea. Rather, McLean states that Victoria &quot;seems pushed by those she loves who would rather possess her than support her,&quot; and that the film ultimately illustrates the impact that &quot;ruthless personalities&quot; can have on &quot;the weaker or more demure.&quot;

Scholar Peter Fraser, in &quot;Cinema Journal&quot;, observes of this tension between art and life that the film implodes its own &quot;narrative and lyrical worlds...  from the moment of recognition, when Vicky looks down at her red shoes and knows that she is then her lyrical persona, her two worlds collapse.&quot; He further states that the interpenetration of the lyrical upon the narrative &quot;alters the meaning of the fiction&quot; itself. This blurring of the lyrical and the narrative is represented at the end of the film, when Vicky jumps onto the train tracks; she is wearing the red shoes which she wore while preparing in her dressing room, despite the fact that in the performance her character does not put them on until part way through the ballet. Powell and Pressburger themselves discussed this idiosyncrasy and it has been subject to significant critical analysis since. Powell decided that it was artistically &quot;right&quot; for Vicky to be wearing the red shoes at that point because if she is not wearing them, it takes away the ambiguity over why she died.

===&quot;The Ballet of the Red Shoes&quot;===
&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is famous for featuring a 17-minute ballet sequence (of a ballet entitled &quot;The Ballet of the Red Shoes&quot;) as its centrepiece. The sequence uses a variety of filmic techniques to provide an &quot;impressionistic link&quot; to the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale on which it (and the ballet within the film) is based, as well as the personal struggles faced by the protagonist, Victoria Page, who is dancing the lead role. McLean notes that the ballet not only duplicates Victoria&#x27;s own story, but also foreshadows her love for Julian, the composer and conductor in the ballet&#x27;s orchestra, as well as the contemptuous jealousy of Lermontov, its director.

Throughout the ballet, visual metaphors and fantastical references to Victoria&#x27;s own life come alive on the screen, including a portion in which she dances with a floating newspaper that alternates in form between mere paper and the human form of Helpmann&#x27;s character; this is referential to a windblown newspaper that Victoria previously stepped on the night she discovered she had acquired the lead role in the ballet.

Unlike in conventional filmed theatrical ballet, the ballet sequence in &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is not one continuous, static shot, but instead employs a variety of editing techniques, close-ups, and special effects. As the ballet progresses, McLean notes that the action of the sequence &quot;rockets from stage right to stage left, a series of swiftly performed vignettes alternating with garishly decorated set pieces. Then, as Robert Helpmann, playing the girl&#x27;s lover, is borne away into the distance by a crowd, leaving the girl alone in her cursed red shoes, the action reverses...  into and through the ballerina&#x27;s subconscious mind.&quot; Because of its dynamic nature and excessive use of cinematic techniques, McLean contests that the ballet sequence is a &quot;greater, or more characteristic, film experience than a dance one.&quot;

===Genre===
The question of genre in relationship of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; has been a recurrent preoccupation of both critics and scholars, as it does not neatly fit within the confines of a single genre. While the film&#x27;s extended ballet sequences led some to characterise the film as a musical, McLean notes that the &quot;conventional signals that had allowed fantasy elements to occur in other [musical] films are missing in &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;.&quot; Fraser contests that the film is not emblematic of the standard musical as it has a tragic and violent resolution, and that it is best understood as a &quot;prototype of a generic variation&quot; emerging from the musical film tradition.

The 21st-century critic Peter Bradshaw identifies elements of horror in the film, particularly in its central, surreal ballet sequence, which he likens to &quot;the surface of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s looking-glass, through which the viewer is transported into a new world of amazement and occult horror.&quot;

==Production==
===Screenplay===
Producer Alexander Korda had conceived a ballet-themed film in 1934, which he intended to be a biopic about Vaslav Nijinsky. The project never came to fruition, but in 1937, Korda found himself again inspired to write a ballet-themed film as a vehicle for Merle Oberon, his future wife. Korda, along with filmmaker Michael Powell, fashioned a film based on Oberon&#x27;s looks, but, because she was not a skilled dancer, Korda knew he would need to use a double for any dance sequences. Korda eventually abandoned the project, instead shifting his focus to &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940).

In 1946, Powell and his filmmaking partner Emeric Pressburger bought the rights to the screenplay Powell had co-written with Korda for £9,000. According to Powell, the original screenplay contained significantly more dialogue and less story.

The character of Boris Lermontov was inspired in part by Sergei Diaghilev, the impresario who founded the Ballets Russes, although there are also aspects about him drawn from the personalities of producer J. Arthur Rank and even director Powell himself. The particular episode in Diaghilev&#x27;s life that is said to have inspired the characterisation is his seeing the 14-year-old Diana Gould partnering Frederick Ashton in the première of his first ballet, &quot;Leda and the Swan&quot;. On the basis of this, Diaghilev invited her to join his company, but he died before that plan could come about.

====Basis====
The Hans Christian Andersen story tells how the orphan Karen&#x27;s colour blind guardian buys her an inappropriate pair of red shoes for her church confirmation ceremony, but, when the mistake is discovered, forbids her to wear them. She disobeys. A crippled &quot;old soldier&quot; at the church door tells Karen they are dancing shoes. Later, she wears them to a ball, and cannot stop dancing. She dances day and night until an executioner, at her request, amputates her feet; the shoes dance away with them. She lives with a parson&#x27;s family after that, and she dies with a vision of finally being able to join the Sunday congregation. In this story, the shoes represent &quot;her sin&quot;, the vanity and worldly pleasures (implicitly, female sexuality) which distracted her from a life of generosity, piety, and community.

The ballet has three characters: the Girl, the Boy and the Shoemaker. The Boy, danced by Robert Helpmann, is at first the girl&#x27;s boyfriend; as she dances, he turns into a sketch on transparent cellophane. Later he appears as the living counterpart of the Press, with &quot;Le Jour&quot; written on his forehead (&quot;The Daily&quot;) and an alter ego made of folded newspapers, then as the prince in a triumphant Pas de deux/six. Finally, the Boy appears as the village parson; when he unties the red shoes, the girl dies in his arms. The Shoemaker, danced by Léonide Massine, is a diabolical figure far beyond the scope of the &quot;old soldier&quot;. Always dancing, he tempts the girl with the shoes, installs them by &quot;movie magic&quot; on her feet, partners her briefly, and generally gloats over her confusion and despair. At one point he leads a mob of &quot;primitive&quot; monsters who surround her, but they elevate her high in a triumphant ballerina pose. At the end, the shoemaker picks up the discarded shoes and offers them to the audience. In the context of the movie, the shoes represent the choice offered by Lermontov to become a great dancer, at the expense of normal human relationships.

===Casting===

Powell and Pressburger decided early on that they had to use dancers who could act rather than actors who could dance. To create a realistic feeling of a ballet company at work, and to be able to include a fifteen-minute ballet as the high point of the film, they created their own ballet company using many dancers from The Royal Ballet.

In casting the lead role of Victoria Page, Powell and Pressburger sought an experienced dancer who could also act. Scottish ballerina Moira Shearer was recommended by Robert Helpmann, who had been cast in the film as Ivan Boleslawsky, and was also appointed the choreographer of the central ballet sequence; Helpmann had worked with Shearer prior in a production of his ballet &quot;Miracle in the Gorbals&quot;. At the time, Shearer was beginning to ascend in her career with the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Dance Company, dancing under Ninette de Valois. Upon reading the screenplay, Shearer declined the offer, as she felt taking a film role would negatively impact her dancing career. She also felt that the screenplay presented a ballet company that was unrealistic, &quot;utterly unlike any ballet company that there had ever been anywhere.&quot; She recalled: &quot;&quot;Red Shoes&quot; was the last thing I wanted to do. I fought for a year to get away from that film, and I couldn&#x27;t shake the director off.&quot;

After Shearer&#x27;s refusal of the role, American ballerinas Nana Gollner and Edwina Seaver tested for the part, but their acting abilities proved unsatisfactory to Powell and Pressburger. Non-dancers Hazel Court and Ann Todd were briefly considered before Shearer changed her mind, and decided to accept the role with de Valois&#x27;s blessing. Shearer claimed that de Valois, exasperated by the ordeal, finally advised her to take the role. Powell alternately recounted that de Valois was &quot;more manipulative&quot; in the process, and would vacillate in regard to whether or not Shearer would have a place in the company to return to once filming was completed, accounting for Shearer&#x27;s alleged protracted contemplation of whether to take the part.

For the role of Julian Craster, the musician with whom Victoria falls in love, Marius Goring was cast. While Goring—at the time in his mid-30s—was slightly too old to play the role, Powell and Pressburger were impressed by his &quot;tact and unselfish approach to his craft.&quot; They cast Anton Walbrook in the part of Victoria&#x27;s domineering ballet director, Boris Lermontov, for similar reasons, as they felt he was a &quot;well-mannered and sensitive actor&quot; who could support Shearer through their emotional scenes together.

The other principal dancers cast in the film included Léonide Massine (who also served as a choreographer for his role as the shoemaker in &quot;The Ballet of the Red Shoes&quot;), portraying dancer Grischa Ljubov, and Ludmilla Tchérina as dancer Irina Boronskaya; the latter was cast by Powell, who was captivated by her unconventional beauty.

===Filming===
Filming of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; took place primarily in Paris, with principal photography beginning in June 1947. Jack Cardiff, who had shot Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;, served as cinematographer. The shooting schedule ran for approximately fifteen weeks, on a budget of . Filming also occurred on location in London, Monte Carlo, and the Côte d&#x27;Azur. Some sequences were filmed at Pinewood Studios, including the stage and orchestra pit sequences, which were sets constructed specifically for the film.
According to biographer Mark Connelly, the shoot was largely copacetic, with the cast and crew having a &quot;happy time&quot; on set. On the first day of the shoot, Powell addressed the cast and crew: &quot;We&#x27;ll be doing things that haven&#x27;t been done before, we&#x27;ll have to work very hard—but I know it&#x27;s going to be worth it.&quot; The shooting of the film&#x27;s central &quot;The Ballet of Red Shoes&quot; sequence took approximately six weeks, according to Shearer, who recalled that it was completed in the middle of the production. Powell disputed this, instead claiming that it was the last portion of the film to be shot. Filming the ballet proved difficult for experienced dancers, who were used to performing live ballet, as the filming process required them to spend hours preparing to shoot moments that lasted sometimes only a few seconds. Shearer recalled that the ballet sequence was &quot;so cinematically worked out that we were lucky if we ever danced for as long as one minute.&quot;

The shoot overran significantly, totalling twenty-four weeks rather than the planned fifteen, and the final budget ballooned to over £500,000. John Davis, the chief accountant of The Rank Organisation, forced a £10,000 cut to Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s salaries due to the film going over budget. Because the shoot was extended so far beyond schedule, Powell and Pressburger promised the cast and crew a fortnight&#x27;s holiday in September.

===Choreography and score===
Australian ballet star Robert Helpmann choreographed the ballet, played the role of the lead dancer of the Ballet Lermontov and danced the part of the boyfriend. Léonide Massine created his own choreography for his role as the Shoemaker. Brian Easdale composed the original music for the film, including the full ballet of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. Easdale conducted most of the music in the film, except for the &quot;Ballet of the Red Shoes&quot;, where Sir Thomas Beecham conducted the score and received prominent screen credit. Beecham&#x27;s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was the featured orchestra for the film. Hilda Gaunt, the long-term Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Royal Ballet pianist, performed as herself.

The score for &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; was written to &quot;fit the cinematic design,&quot; and completed in an unorthodox manner: Easdale composed the score for the film&#x27;s central ballet sequence based on cartoon drawings and storyboards approved by Helpmann, which were assembled in the correct sequence. A total of 120 drawings were provided to help guide Easdale in writing an appropriate musical accompaniment. As filming of the ballet sequence progressed, the hand drawings were replaced by the corresponding completed shots. Easdale received the 1948 Academy Award for Best Original Score, the first British film composer so honoured.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; had its premiere in London on 22 July 1948, and its general release in the United Kingdom was on 6 September 1948. Upon its initial release in the United Kingdom the film was a low-earning picture, as the Rank Organisation could not afford to spend much on promotion due to severe financial problems exacerbated by the expense of &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945). Also, according to Powell, the Rank Organisation did not understand the artistic merits of the film, and this strain in the relationship between The Archers and Rank led to the end of the partnership between them, with The Archers moving to work for Alexander Korda.

Despite a lack of advertising, the film went on to become the sixth most popular film at the British box office in 1948. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the &#x27;biggest winner&#x27; at the box office in 1948 Britain was &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; with &quot;Spring in Park Lane&quot; being the best British film and &quot;runners up&quot; being &quot;It Always Rains on Sunday&quot;, &quot;My Brother Jonathan&quot;, &quot;Road to Rio&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, &quot;The Naked City&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot;, &quot;Forever Amber&quot;, &quot;Life with Father&quot;, &quot;The Weaker Sex&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; and &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;.

The film premiered in the United States at New York City&#x27;s Bijou Theatre on 21 October 1948, distributed by Eagle-Lion Films. By the end of the year, it had earned in US rentals. It ended its run at this cinema on 13 November 1950, playing for a total of 107 weeks. The success of this run convinced Universal Pictures that &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; was a worthwhile film and they took over the US distribution in 1951. &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; went on to become one of the highest-earning British films of all time, with a record-breaking gross of over $5 million.

According to one account, producer&#x27;s receipts were £179,900 in the UK and £1,111,400 overseas. It made a reported profit of £785,700.

===Critical response===

Film scholar Mark Connelly notes that interpreting the contemporaneous critical response to &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is a &quot;complicated task, as there are no simple divisions between those who liked the film and those who did not.&quot; Connelly concludes that the reaction was notably &quot;complex and mixed.&quot; Adrienne McLean similarly states that the film received &quot;only mixed&quot; reviews from both cinema and ballet critics. Upon its release in the United Kingdom, the film received some criticism from the national press, particularly aimed at Powell and Pressburger for the perception that the feature was &quot;undisciplined and downright un-British.&quot;

While the film had its detractors in Britain, it was lauded by some national critics, such as Dilys Powell, who deemed it an &quot;extreme pleasure&quot; and &quot;brilliantly experimental.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, Marion Eames praised the performances of Shearer and Goring, as well as the score. &quot;The Daily Film Renter&quot; published a divisive review, noting that Powell and Pressburger &quot;have fumbled over a fine idea, and their opulent work trembles between the heights and the depths.&quot; Despite this, it was voted the third-best film of the year in a readers&#x27; poll by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, behind &quot;Spring in Park Lane&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

Initial reception proved more favourable in the United States, where the film went on to garner mainstream attention after it screened in the US arthouse circuit.

A main point of contention amongst both British and American critics was a perceived lack of realism concerning the ballet sequences. The focus of this criticism was the film&#x27;s central 17-minute ballet performance of &quot;The Ballet of the Red Shoes&quot;: Many dance critics felt the sequence&#x27;s impressionistic touches—which include abstract hallucinations and visual manifestations of Vicky&#x27;s mental state—detracted from the physical aspects of the ballet. British ballet critic Kathrine Sorley Walker also dismissed the sequence, commenting that it marked &quot;a departure from the illusion of stage ballet to the limitless and lush spaces reflecting the ballerina&#x27;s thought.&quot; Eames made similar criticism, condemning the subjective elements of the sequence as &quot;corrupting the integrity of the ballet,&quot; as well as the choreography. Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, however, praised the presentation of ballet in the film, deeming it &quot;the most ambitious—and probably the most dazzlingly successful—use of traditional-type ballet in any motion picture to date.&quot;

===Accolades===
===Home media and restoration===
The American home media company The Criterion Collection released &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; on laserdisc in 1994, and on DVD in 1999.
Efforts to restore &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; began in the early 2000s. With fundraising spearheaded by Martin Scorsese and his longtime editor (and Powell&#x27;s widow), Thelma Schoonmaker, Robert Gitt and Barbara Whitehead formally began the restoration in the fall of 2006 at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, along with the help of the United States Film Foundation. Gitt, the chief preservation officer of the UCLA Archive, supervised the restoration, assisting Whitehead in reviewing each individual frame of the film—192,960 in the print, 578,880 in the tripartite negative. The original negatives had suffered extensive harm, including shrinkage and mould damage. Because the damage to the negatives was so significant, digital restoration was the only viable method of rehabilitating the film. The 4K digital restoration was completed with the help of the Prasad Corporation and Warner Bros. Motion Picture Imaging to remove dirt, scratches, and other flaws. Digital methods were also used to remove pops, crackles and background hiss from the film&#x27;s original optical soundtrack.

The newly restored version of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; had its world premiere at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Several months later, in October 2009, ITV Films released the restored version on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom. On 20 July 2010, the Criterion Collection again reissued the film in its restored state on DVD and Blu-ray. Reviewing the Criterion Blu-ray, which includes an illustrative demonstration of the film&#x27;s restoration, Stuart Galbraith of DVD Talk referred to the &quot;before and after&quot; comparisons as &quot;shocking and heartening at once.&quot;

On 14 December 2021, Criterion released the 2009 restoration of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; in 4K, as part of their first six-film slate of 4K UHD disc releases.

==Works inspired by the film==
The 1952 film &quot;The Firebird&quot;, directed by Hasse Ekman, is largely an homage to &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;.

In the 1975 Broadway musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; and its 1985 film adaptation, several of the characters speak of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; inspiring their decision to become dancers.

Kate Bush&#x27;s 1993 song and album, &quot;The Red Shoes,&quot; was inspired by the film. The music was subsequently used in &quot;The Line, the Cross and the Curve&quot; (1993) a film referencing &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; written and directed by Bush. It stars Miranda Richardson and Lindsay Kemp.

The film was adapted by Jule Styne (music) and Marsha Norman (book and lyrics) into a Broadway musical, which was directed by Stanley Donen. &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; opened on 16 December 1993 at the Gershwin Theatre, with Steve Barton playing Boris Lermontov, Margaret Illmann playing Victoria Page, and Hugh Panaro playing Julian Craster. The choreography by Lar Lubovitch received the TDF&#x27;s Astaire Award, but the musical closed after 51 previews and only five performances.

In 1996, St Martin&#x27;s Press published &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, a novel &quot;...as memorable and enduring as the great film on which it is based&quot; written by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. 

In 2005, Ballet Ireland produced &quot;Diaghilev and the Red Shoes&quot;, a tribute to Sergei Diaghilev, the ballet impresario who founded Ballets Russes. consisting of excerpts from works made famous by that seminal company. An excerpt from &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; ballet was included, since Diaghilev was one inspiration for the character of Lermontov.

In 2013, Korean singer-songwriter IU released the album Modern Times, which featured the lead single &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, whose lyrics were inspired by the fairy tale, and whose music video was adapted from the film.

The film was adapted as a ballet choreographed by Matthew Bourne and premiered in December 2016 in London. The production used music adapted from film scores by Bernard Herrmann, including themes from &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1947) and &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), in place of Brian Easdale&#x27;s Oscar-winning score from the 1948 film.

In 2022, the award-winning short film &quot;Òran na h-Eala&quot; vividly explored Moira Shearer&#x27;s heart and mind just before and after she agreed to star in &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, a decision that would change her life forever. The film unfolds as a string of dreamlike sequences while Moira sits at a dressing room mirror, reflecting on her career choices.

==Legacy==
Retrospectively, it is regarded as one of the best films of Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s partnership, and in 1999, it was voted the ninth greatest British film of all time by the British Film Institute. In the intervening years, it has garnered status as a cult film and an archetypal dance film. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine saw it ranked the fifth best British film ever. Filmmakers such as Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg have named it one of their all-time favourite films, and Roger Ebert included it in his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot;.

The film is particularly known for its cinematography and especially the use of Technicolor. In the introduction for The Criterion Collection DVD of Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The River&quot;, Scorsese considers &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and &quot;The River&quot; to be the two most beautiful colour films.

<text>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre () is a 1927 adventure novel by German author B. Traven, whose identity remains unknown. In the book, two destitute American men in Mexico of the 1920s join an older American prospector in a search for gold. John Huston adapted the book as a 1948 film of the same name.

==Historical setting==
The novel is set in the decade following the global upheavals of the First World War and social revolutions in Russia and Mexico. The United States is an emerging economic and political power. European and US corporations are aggressively seeking foreign markets, natural resources and cheap labor. Elements within the Catholic Church are struggling to retain their religious freedom as anticlerical Mexican administrations institute social reforms, including an 8-hour day, literacy programs and health care. This is the context of the story.

==Plot==
The author employs a third person-omniscient in a dramatic-progressive structure, where Howard is the focal character. Three stories within a story provide historical and social significance for the outer narrative.

===Summary===
The story opens in the oil boomtown of Tampico, Mexico in the early 1920s. Dobbs, an expatriate who hails from “an industrial American city” is unemployed, penniless and reduced to bumming spare change from American tourists. Loitering on Tampico&#x27;s main plaza, he collects a number of generous handouts from well-to-do men who wear white suits. To Dobbs’ dismay, he discovers that he has been accosting the same individual repeatedly. The irate tourist at last upbraids the panhandler, dismissing him with a half-peso tip.

At the &quot;Hotel Oso Negro&quot; (the Black Bear Hotel), a vermin-infested flophouse, Dobbs pays for a cot and a cold shower at 50 centavos per night. The hotel clientele comprises both employed and unemployed international workers, as well as a number of gamblers, thieves and tramps. The &quot;Oso Negro&quot;, nevertheless, is operated efficiently by its sharp-eyed front desk clerks. The guests themselves collectively provide a degree of good order and security.

In a café, a young Mexican lottery vendor exhorts Dobbs to purchase a ticket. Dobbs insults the boy, but finally consents to risk his last 20 centavos on the drawing.

Dobbs lands a gig unloading agricultural machinery at four pesos per day. Desperate for better wages, he joins a rigging crew as a roughneck, run by American contractor Pat McCormick. A shrewd bidder on lucrative drilling projects, McCormick has a reputation for fast-paced operations and high productivity. He postures as an anti-capitalist and comrade to revolutionaries so as to win the loyalty of his newly arrived European laborers, who are sympathetic to Bolshevism. Americans are wise to his phony appeals to worker solidarity and McCormick avoids hiring them. The pay is $8 a day, less $1.80 for meals. The crews work 18-hour shifts, seven days a week for the duration of the project and no overtime pay. Mexican labor is never hired due to their national eight-hour day provision. When the rigging job is completed, the crew is sent back to Tampico to await payment. McCormick advances a few employees 5% of their pay. Dobbs argues for and gets 30% of his earning in cash.

Weeks pass while Dobbs, along with Californian co-worker named Curtin seek the evasive contractor. The men spot McCormick in the central plaza, promenading with his meretricious mistress. When they confront him, he invites the resentful Dobbs and Curtin into a &quot;cantina&quot; for a drink. Plying the men with liquor, McCormick pleads that he has not yet been reimbursed by the oil company. Curtin curses his lie, while Dobbs thrusts him against the bar, demanding their wages. McCormick, himself a brawler, and capable of beating up the men one-on-one, mentally calculates his losses if he ends up in a hospital after a desperate bar fight against both determined workers. He pulls out the cash he owes Dobbs and Curtin and throws it on the bar top. Vowing to never hire them again, he strides out of the &quot;cantina&quot;.

When Dobbs returns to the &quot;Oso Negro&quot;, he encounters the greying Howard, an old-timer who has travelled the world in search of gold. The loquacious old man is holding forth with his bunkmates on the perils of striking it rich. Discovered in quantity, he avers, gold distorts a man&#x27;s estimate of vice and virtue. Invariably he succumbs to greed, and no amount of gold will satisfy him. Overhearing this, Dobbs becomes agitated, swearing that he is immune to the sinister forces of gold, that he would be happy with a $20,000 fortune, no more. Howard quietly takes the measure of Dobbs with a long look, then returns to his sermon. He assures them that, though no longer in his prime, he is ready to share expenses on a gold-prospecting expedition. Dobbs and the others feel the powerful lure of the precious metal.

====Story within a story: The Legend of &quot;La Mina Agua Verde&quot;====

Dobbs shares the legend of the Green Water Mine with Curtin, and has a premonition that he may be subject to a gold curse. Curtin discounts any “curse” associated with gold and holds that a person&#x27;s character determines its effects; it may be used for bad or good.

With many oil fields beginning to shut down operation in Mexico and relocate to other countries, the two men are impelled to partner with Howard to seek gold. Curtin is skeptical as to the old man&#x27;s fitness, but Dobbs assures him that Howard is indispensable to the success of their venture, wondering if the old timer will even entertain shouldering two greenhorn prospectors. Howard gladly consents, and offers to invest the bulk of his savings, $200, towards the endeavor. Dobbs discovers that his lottery ticket has netted 100 pesos, and Curtin, in turn, collects an outstanding loan repayment with interest to the amount of $200. With about $600 in pooled funds, the trio depart immediately by train for the city of Durango, in the Mexican interior.

In Durango, Howard selects a promising region in the remote Sierra Madre Mountains to search for gold. Purchasing supplies and pack animals in local villages they begin their ascent. Dobbs and Curtin are staggered by the hardships they experience in wilderness travel. Several promising sites are tested, but show only traces of gold. The two inexperienced men begin to despair and consider quitting.

Howard suddenly begins to berate his companions, disparaging their pessimism and ignorance. The old man&#x27;s outburst is such that Dobbs and Curtin suspect he has gone mad. Listening to him, they begin to grasp what he is saying: the keen-eyed miner recognizes that the terrain is laden with placer gold.

An excavation site is selected and the base camp is situated over a mile away for security. The men intend to pose as professional game hunters seeking commercial hides. The approach to the diggings are carefully camouflaged with boulders and trunks. The local people take little interest in their activities and do not molest them. They establish a placer gold operation, using a sluice box, with the water hauled to the apparatus by burros from a nearby creek. Driven by entrepreneurial self-interest, Dobbs and Curtin work to the limits of their endurance. The gold accumulates slowly but surely.

As the fortune piles up, the prospectors&#x27; class identity shifts. With property to defend, they adopt a bourgeois outlook, suspicious of the have-nots. They cease to be proletariats. Even as the men share the same hardships, they do not forge friendships, merely alliances for profit. Their willingness to rescue a partner in distress is self-serving: the loss of one man to death or injury could cripple the profitable enterprise.

Months of hard labor and privations in the wilderness begins to show on the men. They are sick of the grub, the monotony of the work regimen and, especially, of one another. Howard has constantly to intervene to defuse fights between the younger men. In a number of violent confrontations, they pull their pistols and come close to shooting each other over trifles.

The miners begin to anticipate the end of the operation and a return to civil society. Curtin raises the question as to how much each gold share will bring in cash. Howard calculates this to be about $15,000 apiece. The claim is beginning to show signs of depletion and the men set a date of departure of 6–8 weeks. They collaborate in planning the safe transportation and conversion of their riches to currency. For the first time in months, they begin to think of their personal futures.

Curtin makes a final resupply trip to the local village. He takes a few hides as usual to sell at the dry goods store; this, to keep up the pretense he is a hunter. Curtin is accosted by a friendly American newcomer visiting the store. The man insinuates that there is much gold in the nearby mountains; Curtin emphatically denies it. The stranger guesses the significance of Curtin&#x27;s aloofness and trails him into the mountain wilderness.

Without warning, the intruder steps silently into their fire circle. The prospectors are momentarily taken off guard by his arrival. Dobbs recovers, and emphatically tells the man to clear out, but the stranger stands his ground. The miners cunningly ignore the unwelcome guest, and pretend to discuss “hunting” strategies. The stranger bluntly informs them the area is unfit for commercial hunting – rather, they are sitting on a gold field. The prospectors return to their tent intensely suspicious of the man&#x27;s purpose. They permit him to stay the night. The stranger introduces himself as Robert W. Lacaud of Phoenix, Arizona, “Tech, Pasadena”.

When Howard goes to check the burros, he spots mounted men in the distance approaching the encampment. They are not Mexican soldiers or police. Lacaud warns the miners that the horsemen are dangerous bandits, led by the notorious Gold Hat. Tipped off by locals, they are searching for the “hunter” (Curtin) to seize his guns and ammunition. Lacaud assures his companions that their lives are in imminent danger. As they anxiously watch the bandits slowly ascend the trail, Lacaud relates to them the story of Gold Hat, conveyed to him by a local nobleman, don Genaro Montereal, while visiting his estate the previous week.

====Story within a story: Lacaud’s narrative of an incident in the &quot;Viva Nuestro Rey Cristo&quot; Uprising====

The prospectors take up positions in a trench-like ravine with a view of the campsite, fortifying it like a military bunker. Howard assumes command with the consent of the others and holds a war council.

Gold Hat and his men dismount and enter the campsite on foot, expecting to encounter only a lone hunter. Failing to find him, they quarrel and consider returning to the village. The prospectors silently observe these developments from their hidden defenses. As the 20-man bandit group prepare to spend the night, one member explores the vicinity and discovers Curtin in the trench. Curtin warns him away, and the bandit alerts his companions.

Gold Hat approaches Curtin and identifies his cohorts as &quot;policia montada&quot; (mounted police), searching for outlaws who robbed a train. Curtin in turn demands that they show their police badges. Gold Hat, affronted, threatens Curtin with arrest for hunting without a license and possessing unregistered firearms. Curtin brandishes his rifle and the bandits determine to lay siege to his foxhole; they prefer to take him alive so as to torture him to death for entertainment. The methods they will use matches the iconography of Catholic Church and the practice of torture by the Inquisition. The bandits wear the icons of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph, believing they will protect them in their endeavors.

Gold Hat tries to lure Curtin from his foxhole with promises of a gold watch. Rebutted, the outlaws construct movable barriers to assault the trench. Before they can deploy them, a company of genuine mounted police, alerted by villagers, appear and pursue Gold Hat and his gang as they flee the encampment.

With the ordeal over, Howard, Dobbs and Curtin express a desire to terminate operations and return immediately to civilization, Howard confides to Dobbs and Curtin that Lacaud is an eccentric “eternal” – a prospector who becomes obsessed over a coveted diggings and will not abandoned even after decades of failure. They leave him to his fate. Howard directs the dismantling of their mine so as to leave no trace of its existence. Howard warns his cohorts that the next phase – transferring the gold dust back to civilization – may be the riskiest phase and they become preoccupied with its challenges. Howard illustrates these dangers in his tale of the Dona Maria Mine.

==== Story within a Story: Legend of Dona Catalina Maria de Rodriguez and the “Dona Maria” Mine. ====

Howard, Curtin, and Dobbs take leave of Lacaud and head for Durango. The threesome avoid populated areas and refrain from acting suspicious so as not to draw attention from locals. Passing through a tiny village, they are detained by Mexican officials. Expecting the worst – that they will be fined for operating an unregistered mine – the officials turn out to be medical technicians for the Health Commission vaccinating the residents for smallpox. The prospectors gladly submit to be inoculated and go their way.

Setting up camp, they are intercepted by a delegation of mounted &quot;indios&quot;. The farmers request that the American accompany them to their village: the son of one of the men has been pulled from a swimming hole unconscious and cannot be revived. Howard consents to accompany them to their village and examine the boy. There, he applies basic First Aid to the child and he recovers. The villagers regard Howard&#x27;s powers as those of a medicine-man or magician.

Howard rejoins Dobbs and Curtin and they resume their journey, but they are shortly overtaken by the father of the boy he saved. The man and his companions insist that Howard return to the village so they can pay back the debt – a matter of etiquette and honor. The prospectors recognize that the &quot;indios&quot; are in earnest, and Howard relents. He relinquishes his possessions – including his share of gold – to the care of Dobbs and Curtin. They promise to rendezvous with him in Durango. Howard is welcome as a hero by the villagers upon his return.

Dobbs and Curtin, struggling to cross the high Sierra Madre, begin to quarrel in the absence of Howard&#x27;s steadying influence. Dobbs, regretting having agreed to transport Howard&#x27;s gear, lashes out at Curtin. Curtin maintains his composure and shoulders most of the work. Despite this, the unstable Dobbs descends into a homicidal rage, which Curtin, though anxious, is slow to grasp. When Dobbs proposes that they abscond with Howard&#x27;s share, Curtin flatly vetoes the notion. Dobbs reacts to his comrade&#x27;s defense of Howard as a symptom of Bolshevism. Curtin does not deny being a socialist, but emphatically refuses to betray the old man. Though not above some unscrupulousness himself, his actions are directed toward those who have power and wealth, not against his companions. When Dobbs pulls his pistol, Curtin is thunderstruck; he realizes that Dobbs is a homicidal maniac. Curtin manages to disarm Dobbs, but cannot, on principle, bring himself to kill an unarmed man. Dobbs’ hatred and contempt for Curtin deepens when he interprets this restraint as “Bolshevik” in character.

The unarmed Dobbs bides his time in the ensuing days, taunting his bewildered companion. Curtin is forced to remain awake at night to fend off an assault by Dobbs. Exhausted, he finally slips into sleep. Dobbs instantly seizes his pistol and marches Curtin into the underbrush where he shoots him point blank. Returning minutes later to make sure the man is dead, he shoots into the prostrate body a second time.

In an attempt to rationalize his crime, Dobbs recalls that, while serving in the US military in Europe, he had killed German soldiers in combat. His conscience troubles him, but he finally falls into a deep sleep. He awakes and searches for Curtin&#x27;s body, but cannot find it. He begins to hallucinate as his alienation and guilt take hold of him.

He departs camp and makes good progress towards Durango, in possession of all the gold. When he spots a locomotive in the distant valley, his anxiety fades and he contemplates a trip to the British Isles, the home of his ancestors. His only concern is that his crime will be discovered before he can cash in and escape. In sight of Durango, he is reassured that the law and order that protects property in civilized areas will assert itself. Dobbs gloats over his presumed killing of Curtin and his double-dealing of Howard.

On the outskirts of Durango, Dobbs and his pack train stumble onto three Mestizo desperados – Miguel, Nacho, and Pablo – at a secluded site off the main road. Dobbs senses his life is in danger. The Mestizos begin to ransack the packs. Dobbs pulls his pistol, only to find it is unloaded. After one of the Mestizos knocks Dobbs to the ground with a rock to the head, Miguel, the leader of the gang, decapitates the stunned Dobbs with a machete. The men don his boots and pants but leave his bloody shirt behind, and escape with the pack train.

The outlaws, upon examining the contents of the pack, find only what appears to be sand in burlap bags. They guess that this is ballast placed in the packs to inflate the value by weight of commercial hides, or perhaps samples taken by a mining company engineer. They cannot fathom that it could be a fortune in placer gold. Frustrated at the paucity of loot, they slash the bags and contents pour out, swept away by the wind.

The desperados travel to a tiny village in the high Sierra Madre and offer the stolen burros for sale. The village elders casually examine the animals and the men&#x27;s outfits. The brands on the burros are recognized as those sold to three prospectors months before. The village mayor is sent for; he engages the three Mestizos in an unassuming, yet probing interrogation regarding their acquisition of the burros and packs. The thieves are equivocal. The mayor quietly assembles the men of the village. After further cross-examination and more inconsistences in the scenario, a posse is sent to locate Dobbs and discover his decapitated remains. The local military garrison is notified, and a captain arrives with a platoon of troopers to take the Mestizos into custody. While being marched back to the garrison, the accused murderers are shot to death while trying to “escape”. Their corpses are buried where they fell, with a cynical display of decorum.

Curtin, wounded and barely alive, is found crawling through the underbrush by a local woodsman. He takes Curtin to his home, and Howard is notified that a gringo needs medical care. When Howard arrives, Curtin relates his ordeal with Dobbs, and swears revenge. Howard, reflecting on the incident, and without exonerating Dobbs, does not consider him a natural killer. The old timer points to the temptation of $50,000 in gold, and declares that any person might be tempted to murder for it. The two men agree to pursue Dobbs and retrieve their fortunes – not yet knowing Dobbs’ fate.

While Curtin convalesces, Howard embarks for Durango, but he is intercepted by the mayor who presided over the interrogation of Dobbs’ murderers and tells him the story. Howard is informed that the gold has been lost. He returns to his village with the pack and relates the tragic news to Curtin. Grasping the enormity of the disaster, Howard roars with Homeric laughter. Curtin is at first offended, distraught at the loss of the fortune, but finally joins the old prospector in his ironic mirth. They then take a second look through the pack and find two small bags of gold after all, and briefly consider opening a store in the port town.

Howard decides he is content to remain in the village as a medicine-man and offers Curtin to accompany him as an apprentice doctor.

Howard remains enthusiastic about a life as an honored member of the Indio community. Curtin bids Howard farewell, and promises to visit his old comrade when he fully recovers. The fate of Lacaud is never mentioned.

== Adaptations ==

===Film===
* John Huston successfully adapted the book as a 1948 film of the same name.
* The 1984 made-for-television movie &quot;Wet Gold&quot; has been called an unofficial remake of &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, borrowing the basic storyline but set in the modern-day Caribbean and concerning a sunken treasure of gold bars.

===Television===
* Episode 3 of the first season of the 1955 TV series &quot;Cheyenne&quot; gives a writing credit (novel) to B. Traven, and contains the same basic plot as the novel, with the main character, Cheyenne, standing in the role of the old prospector, Howard, of the original story.

===Video games===
* The first DLC for the game &quot;&quot;, titled &quot;Dead Money&quot;, borrows from the basic themes of the novel, with some post-apocalyptic twists, replacing the Sierra Madre mountains with the ruins of a casino known as the Sierra Madre, and having the antagonist of the DLC &quot;solving&quot; the novel&#x27;s issue of greed by equipping the player character and all of the other NPCs in the DLC with bomb collars equipped with dead man&#x27;s switches, so that if one of the group dies, they all die.

<doc id="60173" wikidata="Q1618931" url="?curid=60173" title="State Fair (1933 film)">
<text>State Fair is a 1933 American pre-Code comedy-drama film directed by Henry King and starring Janet Gaynor, Will Rogers, and Lew Ayres. The film tells the story of a farm family&#x27;s multi-day visit to the Iowa State Fair, where the parents seek to win prizes in agricultural and cooking competitions, and their teenage daughter and son each find unexpected romance.

Based on the bestselling 1932 novel by Phil Stong, this was the first of three film adaptations of the novel; the others were &quot;State Fair&quot; (1945) starring Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews, and &quot;State Fair&quot; (1962) starring Ann-Margret and Pat Boone. The 1933 film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, losing to &quot;Cavalcade&quot; and &quot;Little Women&quot; respectively.

==Plot==
In the fictional town of Brunswick, Iowa, farmer Abel Frake prepares to transport his Hampshire pig, Blue Boy, to compete at the hog contest at the Iowa State Fair. Confident he will win the first-place prize, and nothing bad will happen, Abel bets five dollars against his neighbor Fred Cramer. Abel&#x27;s wife Melissa, is preparing pickles and mincemeat for the food competition. Against his wife&#x27;s insistence, Abel secretly adds apple brandy. Unsure about her chances of winning, Melissa adds the remaining brandy. Meanwhile, Abel&#x27;s daughter Margy reconnects with childhood friend Harry Ware. He is unable to attend the fair because he is preoccupied with his dairy farm. Margy&#x27;s brother, Wayne, arrives home from college to attend the fair.

After the Frakes arrive at the fair, Abel notices Blue Boy appears ill. At a carnival hoop toss game, Wayne throws the rings perfectly and meets Emily Joyce, a trapeze artist. Later that night, Wayne and Margy venture out to the circus fair. Wayne separates from his sister, and sees Emily perform a trapeze stunt. Meanwhile, Margy rides the roller coaster ride, seated next to Pat Gilbert, a newspaper reporter. When the roller coaster descends rapidly, Gilbert holds her tightly. After their ride together, the two bond over their connection to Brunswick, and have lemonade.

The next morning, Melissa notices how emotionally elevated her two children are. Abel inspects Blue Boy, in which the hog appears to be healthy again. Back at the circus, Pat reconnects with Margy, in which they decide to be friends rather than romantic lovers. They plan to meet again at Melissa&#x27;s competition, which Pat is covering for his newspaper. At the food competition, Melissa wins the first-place prize for both her pickles and mincemeat. Having fallen in love, Pat and Margy then watch a harness horse race and walk through the woods later that night.

Back at Emily&#x27;s place, she and Wayne share drinks. Emily changes into her nightgown, and the two sleep together. The next morning, Abel tries to wake up Blue Boy for the hog contest, succeeding at the last minute. The hog judges inspect Blue Boy and award Abel first prize. Later that night, Wayne apologizes to his father for missing the hog contest. Wayne and Margy both leave for their final night at the fair. Alone with Melissa, Abel reads in the newspaper that one of the food judges is sick from delirium after eating Melissa&#x27;s brandy-spiked mincemeat.

Despite their love, Emily decides not to marry Wayne. On their final night, Margy tells Pat about her feeling for Harry back home. Meanwhile, Abel and Melissa enjoy the amusement rides together. As the Frakes leave the state fair, Melissa notices her children&#x27;s despondent demeanor. Back home, Melissa confesses putting apple brandy in her mincemeat. Abel collects his five-dollar bet from Fred. Margy, still depressed, receives a phone call from Pat and runs out into a rainstorm to reunite with him.

==Production==
Though the adaptation deleted a storyline about a sexual relationship between the daughter and a journalist, it retained a similar storyline about the seduction of the son (Norman Foster) by a trapeze artist (Sally Eilers). This caused trouble with the Hays Commission when Fox re-released the film in 1935. The censors insisted on the deletion of a scene where Foster and Eilers are heard talking off screen while the camera shows a rumpled bed and a discarded negligee. The cut scene has never been restored.

<text>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is a 1954 American musical film, directed by Stanley Donen, with music by Gene de Paul, lyrics by Johnny Mercer, and choreography by Michael Kidd. The screenplay, by Albert Hackett, Frances Goodrich, and Dorothy Kingsley, is based on the short story &quot;The Sobbin&#x27; Women&quot; by Stephen Vincent Benét, which was based in turn on the ancient Roman legend of the Rape of the Sabine women. &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, which is set in Oregon in 1850, is particularly known for Kidd&#x27;s unusual choreography, which makes dance numbers out of such mundane frontier pursuits as chopping wood and raising a barn. Film critic Stephanie Zacharek has called the barn-raising sequence in &quot;Seven Brides&quot; &quot;one of the most rousing dance numbers ever put on screen.&quot; The film was photographed in Ansco Color in the CinemaScope format.

&quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture and was nominated for four additional awards, including Best Picture. In 2006, American Film Institute named &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; as one of the best American musical films ever made. In 2004, the same year Howard Keel died, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

In 1850, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee arrives at an Oregon Territory town to look for a bride and breaks into song about it. (&quot;Bless Your Beautiful Hide&quot;). He eventually meets Milly and proposes to her after seeing her strength, hardworking attitude, and the quality of her cooking. He is further pleased at Milly’s insistence on finishing her chores before she leaves with him. Despite not knowing him well, she accepts Adam’s proposal under the belief she will be taking care of only him and she sings about it (&quot;Wonderful, Wonderful Day&quot;).

When they arrive at his mountain cabin however, she is surprised to learn that he has six brothers – Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank, and Gideon – who all live uncouth lives with him. As Adam walks her through their house, he informs her she will be responsible for cleaning, laundering, and cooking for all of them, telling her to make dinner and leaving her alone in the kitchen. After a disastrous dinner, an angered Milly accuses Adam of manipulating her into becoming his servant, but he acknowledges that he wanted to marry someone strong and hardworking to work alongside him due to how difficult living in the backwoods is. Adam plans on sleeping outside to avoid losing face with his brothers after Milly refuses to share a bed with him. She eventually lets Adam back into the room upon seeing him climb up to sleep in a tree, explaining she had high hopes regarding marriage and love and decides to sing a song (&quot;When You&#x27;re in Love&quot;).

The next morning, Milly uses her cleverness, skills, and persuasion to begin teaching the Pontipee brothers cleanliness and proper manners. She is later surprised to learn that despite their handsomeness, Adam&#x27;s brothers have remained unmarried because they rarely see women and never learned how to interact with them. Despite initial difficulties in changing their &quot;mountain man&quot; ways, they realize they can find someone to marry if they follow Milly&#x27;s example. They then sing (&quot;Goin&#x27; Courtin&#x27;&quot;). At a barn-raising social gathering, the brothers meet townswomen Dorcas, Ruth, Martha, Liza, Sarah, and Alice, all of whom take a fancy to one of the brothers despite the women already having suitors, resulting in another song (&quot;Barn Dance&quot;). The suitors taunt and sneakily attack the Pontipees during the barn raising. The brothers resist the urge to fight at Milly&#x27;s previous request even after the suitors hit the brothers with the barn-raising tools and boards, but one suitor then attacks Adam, provoking Gideon to retaliate. A brawl ensues in which the physically superior Pontipees overpower the suitors, but the Pontipees anger the townspeople by ruining the barn raising and beating down their men.

As winter comes and the brothers pine for the women they fell in love with they sing (&quot;Lonesome Polecat&quot;), and Milly asks Adam to help them. He reads his brothers &quot;The Sobbin&#x27; Women&quot; and Milly&#x27;s Bible, telling them they should do whatever it takes to get their loves.

With Adam&#x27;s aid, the brothers kidnap the six women before causing an avalanche in Echo Pass to stop the pursuing townspeople. However, the Pontipees realize they forgot to kidnap a parson to conduct their weddings, and they will be snowed in at their homestead until spring. Furious at the Pontipees&#x27; actions, Milly forces the men to live in the barn while the women stay in the house with her, sleeping in the brothers&#x27; beds. In response, a similarly furious Adam leaves for the Pontipees&#x27; trapping cabin further up the mountain to spend the winter alone. Gideon tells Milly, but she refuses to stop Adam from leaving.

Over the winter, the women vent their frustrations by pranking the remaining Pontipees and muse upon their slowly softening feelings towards marriage and decide to sing (&quot;June Bride&quot;). Milly informs the women that she is pregnant with Adam’s child and will give birth in the spring. Spring arrives and the women and the Pontipees are paired off and happy in each other&#x27;s company prompting another song (&quot;Spring, Spring&quot;) until Milly announces she is having Adam&#x27;s baby, causing everyone present to come together to help her. She gives birth to a baby girl and Gideon leaves to tell Adam. Adam still refuses to return, despite learning that he has a child. He expresses anger that Milly has had a girl rather than a boy and accuses her of having a baby just to make him come home. Gideon rebukes him for his selfishness and punches him before leaving, stating that he is ashamed of Adam&#x27;s behavior towards Milly. Angered, Adam sends Gideon home. After the snow in Echo Pass melts, Adam returns, as he had said he would. He meets his daughter, and together, he and Milly choose a name for her: Hannah. Adam states that while he was in the hunting lodge after hearing about the birth of his daughter, he started to understand how the townspeople would feel having their daughters stolen away from them. He realizes how worried the townspeople must be over the missing women and tells his brothers they should return them. The brothers—although heartbroken—acquiesce, and attempt to bring their respective brides back to their families, but the women run and hide, refusing to go back to town. The brothers try to gather the women to bring them back to the town only to encounter the angry townspeople, who have come through the pass intending to hang them for kidnapping the girls.

Alice&#x27;s father, Reverend Elcott, hears Hannah crying as the townspeople sneak up onto the farm. Assuming the baby belongs to one of the six townswomen, he asks them whose child Hannah is. After they all answer &quot;mine&quot;, the fathers begrudgingly agree to give the six brothers and the six women a collective shotgun wedding.

===Brothers===
To perform the dance numbers and action sequences, choreographer Michael Kidd wanted dancers to portray all six of Adam Pontipee&#x27;s brothers. Kidd said that he &quot;had to find a way to have these backwoods men dance without looking ridiculous. I had to base it all around activities you would accept from such people – it couldn&#x27;t look like ballet. And it could only have been done by superbly trained dancers.&quot; However, he was able to integrate into the cast two non-dancer MGM contract players who were assigned to the film, Jeff Richards, who performed just the simpler dance numbers, and Russ Tamblyn, using him in the dance numbers by exploiting his talents as a gymnast and tumbler.

The other four brothers were portrayed by professional dancers – Matt Mattox, Marc Platt, Tommy Rall, and Jacques d&#x27;Amboise. All four balanced on a beam together during their barn-raising dance.

The wood-chopping scene in &quot;Lonesome Polecat&quot; was filmed in a single take.

* Adam (&quot;light green shirt&quot;): Howard Keel, a professional singer, appeared as the eldest of the seven brothers. He also appeared as &quot;Petruchio&quot; in the film version of &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;, and appeared in leading roles in other musical films including &quot;Calamity Jane&quot;, &quot;Rose Marie&quot; and &quot;Show Boat&quot;.
* Benjamin (&quot;orange shirt&quot;): Jeff Richards was a former professional baseball player who topped out at the AAA level of the minor leagues. Although obviously athletic, he is noticeably in the background, seated, or standing during the dance numbers so as to not expose his lesser dancing skills. This often relegated his partner, the classically trained ballet dancer Julie Newmar, to the background as well.
* Caleb (&quot;yellow shirt&quot;): Matt Mattox, a professional dancer, appeared on stage on Broadway and also danced in many Hollywood musical films. His singing voice for the film was dubbed by Bill Lee.
* Daniel (&quot;mauve shirt&quot;): Marc Platt, a professional dancer, danced the role of &quot;Chalmers / Dream Curly&quot; in the original 1943 Broadway production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. He also had a dancing/speaking role in the 1955 film version of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, as Curly&#x27;s friend who buys his saddle at the auction and complains about Ado Annie&#x27;s pie.
* Ephraim (&quot;dark green shirt&quot;): Jacques d&#x27;Amboise, a principal dancer with New York City Ballet, was given special leave for the filming of &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (although he was recalled before filming was completed). He also danced in other musical films, including the ballet role of the &quot;Starlight Carnival&quot; &quot;barker&quot; in the film &quot;Carousel&quot; (in which he partnered Susan Luckey in &quot;Louise&#x27;s ballet&quot;). D&#x27;Amboise&#x27;s work as a dance teacher for children was featured in the documentary film &quot;He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot;, which won an Academy Award and Tony Award.
* Frank (&quot;red shirt&quot;): Tommy Rall, a professional dancer and singer, appeared on stage on Broadway and in many musical films. His roles included Bill Calhoun (Lucentio) in the film version of &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;, and one of the Gallini brothers in the film &quot;Merry Andrew&quot; (in which he was one of the three featured acrobatic dancers in the circus engagement scene – Rall is the dancer in the center wearing the red shirt). He appeared in the film &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, as the Prince who partnered Barbra Streisand in a parody of the ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.
* Gideon (&quot;blue shirt&quot;): Russ Tamblyn was cast in the role of youngest brother Gideon. Tamblyn showcased his gymnastics training throughout the action sequences. He also had a starring role in the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; as Riff. As of 2021, following d&#x27;Amboise&#x27;s death, Tamblyn is the last surviving actor who played a brother.

===Brides===
Professional dancers played all seven of the brides.

The four girls whom Adam sees in the Bixby store when he first goes into town are Dorcas, Ruth, Liza and Sarah.

* Milly: Jane Powell channelled her experiences growing up in Oregon to create Milly. She and Howard Keel would later reprise their roles in a &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; stage adaptation. She also appeared in dancing and singing roles in many other musical films, including &quot;Royal Wedding&quot;, and &quot;Rich, Young and Pretty&quot; and also &quot;A Date with Judy&quot;. In the film, she marries Adam.
* Dorcas Gaylen: Julie Newmar (Newmeyer), wore a purple dress in the barn raising scene. Dorcas is one of the more confident girls, and has stated that she always wanted to be a June bride and have a baby right away. She is also the only girl shown to have a sibling, a younger sister. A classically trained ballerina, she would later rise to fame as Catwoman in the 1960s TV version of &quot;Batman&quot;. She also won a Supporting Actress Tony Award for &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; (starring Claudette Colbert). She appeared on her neighbor James Belushi&#x27;s sitcom &quot;According to Jim&quot; after the two settled a highly publicized lawsuit. Her singing voice for the film was dubbed by Betty Allen. She marries Benjamin.
* Ruth Jepson: Ruta Lee (Kilmonis) enjoyed a long stage and television career, appearing in dozens of films and TV series, working with Lucille Ball, Sammy Davis Jr., Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie Wood, and Frank Sinatra. Lee appeared in the sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; as the first girlfriend of Roseanne&#x27;s mother. Her singing parts for the film were dubbed in post-production by Betty Noyes. She is wearing a blue dress in the barn raising scene, and is shown to like baking pies. She marries Caleb.
* Martha: Norma Doggett performed in the 1940s-50s Broadway shows &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, &quot;Fanny&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Miss Liberty&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Her singing voice for the film was dubbed by Bobbie Canvin. She wears a green dress during the barn raising scene. She marries Daniel.
* Liza: Virginia Gibson was nominated for a Tony Award in 1957 and performed regularly, as singer and dancer, on the Johnny Carson show. She wears a pink checkered dress during the barn raising scene. She marries Ephraim.
* Sarah Kine: Betty Carr was also a Broadway veteran, dancing in &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, &quot;Happy Hunting&quot;, &quot;Mask and Gown&quot;, and &quot;Fanny&quot; (alongside Norma Doggett). Her singing voice for the film was dubbed by Norma Zimmer. She wears a yellow dress during the barn raising. She marries Frank.
* Alice Elcott: Nancy Kilgas made her film debut in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;. The youngest of the girls in the story, she is especially close with Milly and wears a peach colored dress in the barn raising scene. Her father is the town reverend. Gideon falls in love with her at first sight. She danced in the film versions of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Rock!&quot;, and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;. Her singing voice for the film was dubbed by Marie Greene. She marries Gideon.

===Townspeople===
* Reverend Elcott (Ian Wolfe) is the local preacher and father of Alice, one of the brides. He is the officiant in both wedding ceremonies in the movie. A longtime Hollywood character actor, he is perhaps best remembered for his roles as Carter, chief clerk to &quot;Wilfred the Fox&quot; (Sir Wilfred Roberts) in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, Mr. Atoz in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;, as Father Joseph the Abbot in &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot;, and as &quot;Hirsch&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Carlson&#x27;s&quot; butler on &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati.&quot;
* Pete Perkins (Howard Petrie) is a leading citizen of the town where the Pontipees do their trading. Another longtime Hollywood character actor, he is also known for his role as Tom Hendricks in &quot;Bend of the River&quot; and as Mr. Lattimore, the prosecuting attorney in the Randolph Scott movie &quot;Rage At Dawn&quot;.
* Mrs. Bixby (Marjorie Wood), co-owner of the general store in the town. Perhaps best known for playing Lady Lucas opposite Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, she was a Hollywood veteran of 34 films going back to the silent movie era. She died a year after shooting wrapped on the movie.
* Mr. Bixby (Russell Simpson), co-owner of the general store in the town. A longtime Hollywood actor with 244 movie and television credits to his name going well back into the silents in 1914, his best known roles are as Pa Joad in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, and Red Kelly in &quot;San Francisco&quot;.
* Harry (Earl Barton)
* Matt (Dante DiPaolo)
* Carl (Kelly Brown)
* Ruth&#x27;s Uncle (Matt Moore)
* Dorcas&#x27; Father (Dick Rich)

==Production==
According to Dore Schary, Joseph Losey recommended the Stephen Vincent Benet story “The Sobbin’ Women” as the basis for a musical film to Schary when the latter was head of production at RKO. Schary tried to get the rights but Joshua Logan had it under option for a stage production. When Logan dropped the option, Schary arranged for MGM to purchase the rights. Schary later said &quot;everything worked&quot; on the film.

Dorothy Kingsley was brought on to the film to replace Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett who she says &quot;didn&#x27;t get along with Stanley Donen. They were lovely people, darling . . . but the script just wasn&#x27;t coming out right, they were unhappy, and he was unhappy. They wanted to bow out. Stanley Donen called me in and I looked at the script and said, &quot;The big trouble in the original short story is that the Howard Keel character is the one that tries to get all of these boys married off, and that&#x27;s not right. The girl has nothing to do, and she&#x27;s got to be the one to engineer all this stuff.&quot; That was changed around and seemed to please everyone, and we went from there.&quot;

Choreographer Michael Kidd originally turned down the film, recalling in 1997: &quot;Here are these slobs living off in the woods. They have no schooling, they are uncouth, there&#x27;s manure on the floor, the cows come in and out – and they&#x27;re gonna get up and dance? We&#x27;d be laughed out of the house.&quot;

Lyricist Johnny Mercer said that the musical numbers were written at Kidd&#x27;s behest, as an example &quot;of how a songwriter sometimes has to take his cue from his collaborators.&quot; For example, Kidd explained to Mercer and dePaul his conception of the &quot;Lonesome Polecat&quot; number, the lament of the brothers for the women, and the two worked out the music and lyrics.

In his introduction to a showing on Turner Classic Movies on January 17, 2009, host Robert Osborne, as well as Jane Powell in her autobiography, &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;, both say MGM was much less interested in &quot;Seven Brides&quot; than it was in &quot;Brigadoon&quot; which was also filming at the time, even cutting its budget and transferring the money to the Lerner and Loewe vehicle.

Most of the movie was shot on the MGM sound stages. One exterior sequence not filmed at the studio was shot on location at Corral Creek Canyon in Sun Valley, Idaho. It was here that the escape following the brothers&#x27; kidnapping their future brides and the avalanche that closed the pass was filmed.

On the 2004 DVD commentary, Stanley Donen states that the film was originally shot in two versions, one in CinemaScope and another in normal ratio, because MGM was concerned that not all theaters had the capability to screen it. Despite the fact that it cost more than the widescreen version to make, he says, the other version was never used. However, both versions are available on the 1999 LaserDisc and 2004 DVD releases.

The dresses worn by the female cast were made from old quilts that costume designer Walter Plunkett found at the Salvation Army.

Howard Keel wrote in his memoirs &quot;Donen did a good job directing &quot;Seven Brides&quot;, but the real hero and brains behind it was Jack Cummings.&quot;

Donen later said making the film was &quot;a nightmare because it was a terrible struggle from the beginning of the picture until the end.&quot;

==Songs and music==
The &quot;Main Title&quot; is a medley of the songs &quot;Sobbin&#x27; Women&quot;, &quot;Bless Your Beautiful Hide&quot; and &quot;Wonderful, Wonderful Day&quot;.

In the film, Matt Mattox&#x27;s voice is dubbed in by Bill Lee on &quot;Lonesome Polecat&quot;. Mattox can be heard singing the song on the soundtrack album.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Contemporary reviews from critics were positive. When it premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a wholly engaging, bouncy, tuneful and panchromatic package ... Although the powers at M-G-M are deviating from the normal song-and-dance extravaganza in &#x27;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,&#x27; it is a gamble that is paying rich rewards.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;This is a happy, hand-clapping, foot-stomping, country type of musical with all the slickness of a Broadway show. It offers songs, dances and romancing in such a delightful package that word-of-mouth could talk it into solid business at the boxoffice.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared: &quot;Dandy dancing, singable songs and the ozone of originality make &#x27;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&#x27; the niftiest musical I&#x27;ve seen in months.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;A thoroughly delightful blend of songs, dances and romantic comedy&quot; with &quot;exceptionally good musical numbers.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the dances &quot;give the picture its remarkably spirited and exhilarating quality ... A minor weakness is the playing of Jane Powell, whose Milly is a somewhat colourless figure; Howard Keel, the brides and the brothers, however, are all admirable.&quot;

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; posted a dissenting negative review, writing that the film &quot;got on my nerves&quot; and &quot;struck me as desperately contrived and often witless&quot;, though he did concede that there were &quot;some fine dances&quot; in it.

===Box Office===
&quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; was the 5th most popular film at the British box office in 1955.

According to MGM records it made $5,526,000 in the US and Canada and $3,877,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $3,198,000.

===Legacy===
The film came in third in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Number One Essential Musicals&quot; and was listed as number eight in the &quot;Top 10 MGM musicals&quot; in the book &quot;Top 10 of Film&quot; by Russell Ash. In 2004, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; In 2006, it was ranked #21 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of best musicals. In 2008, the film was ranked number 464 in &quot;Empire&quot;{{&#x27;}}s list of the 500 greatest films of all time.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes awards &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; an 89% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The critics&#x27; consensus states: &quot;Buoyed by crowd-pleasing tunes and charming performances, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; makes a successful transition from Broadway to screen that&#x27;s sure to please the whole family.&quot;

<text>A most wanted list is a list of criminals and alleged criminals who are believed to be at large and are identified as a law enforcement agency&#x27;s highest priority for capture. The list can alert the public to be watchful, and generates publicity for the agency.

==History==
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was the first agency to create a most wanted list. The FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list was inaugurated on March 14, 1950, at the direction of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. The idea for the list came from a question asked by a reporter for the International News Service. The reporter asked the FBI to provide names and descriptions of the &quot;toughest guys&quot; that the agency wanted to capture. After observing the high level of public interest generated by the resulting news story, Hoover decided to publish a formal list.

==Context==

===Collective===
In the years following the creation of the American initial lists, other law enforcement agencies around the world, representing all jurisdictional levels, have issued their own lists of most wanted fugitives. 

Although lists often contain lone suspects, they sometimes contain individuals who form part of a larger network. Sometimes this can constitute a closely knit network as a gang, but can also constitute a loose-connected or a person within an umbrella agglomeration whose association to one another is negligible and may even have an international scope. 

In such collective scenarios, there is a common assumption that making it onto a fugitive-like list necessitates rendering such an individual as a leading figure within one&#x27;s field of turpitude. However ofttimes such an individual&#x27;s upturn in notability may largely stem from notoriety caused by mainstream media sensationalism or in international situations, due to a shared nationality between the suspect and the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency. 

List members generally are not ranked by priority. Historically, a higher proportion of suspected persons on such lists were often listed in accordance with deeds pertaining to betrayal, such as double agents, or purveyors of treason.

===Individuals===
There is no official worldwide list of most wanted fugitives. Interpol publishes a list of &quot;red notices&quot; identifying and describing fugitive persons who are wanted by a national jurisdiction and are being sought internationally for capture and extradition. This is, however, an inclusive list rather than a &quot;most wanted&quot; list. In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine published an informal list of the World&#x27;s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives, assembled after consulting with law enforcement agencies around the world. Candidates for the &quot;Forbes&quot; list were fugitives thought to be dangerous who had &quot;a long history of committing serious crimes&quot;, who had been indicted or charged with a crime in a national jurisdiction or by an international tribunal, and who were involved with a type of criminal activity &quot;with which legal institutions in diverse jurisdictions are grappling&quot;. The &quot;Forbes&quot; list has been updated and republished in subsequent years.

==Examples==
* &quot;Alcatrazlistan&quot;, organized crime list in Sweden named after the San Francisco prison
* EU Most Wanted
* FBI Most Wanted Terrorists
* FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives
* ICE Most Wanted
* List of Mexico&#x27;s 37 most-wanted drug lords
* List of most wanted fugitives in Italy
* NIA Most Wanted, most wanted in India
* Saudi list of most-wanted suspected terrorists
* U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis

<text>Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Nicknamed &quot;the Boss&quot;, he has released 21 studio albums spanning over six decades, most featuring the E Street Band, his backing band since 1972. Springsteen is a pioneer of heartland rock, combining commercially successful rock with poetic, socially conscious lyrics which reflect working class American life. He is known for his descriptive lyrics and energetic concerts, which sometimes last over four hours.

Springsteen released his first two albums, &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; and &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;, in 1973. Although both were well-received by critics, neither earned him a large audience. He changed his style and achieved worldwide popularity with &quot;Born to Run&quot; (1975). Springsteen followed with &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; (1978) and &quot;The River&quot; (1980), Springsteen&#x27;s first album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. After the solo acoustic album &quot;Nebraska&quot; (1982), he recorded &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (1984) with the E Street Band, which became his most commercially successful album and the 23rd-best selling album of all time as of 2024. All seven singles from &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; reached the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including the title track. Springsteen mostly hired session musicians for the recording of his next three albums, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; (1987), &quot;Human Touch&quot; (1992), and &quot;Lucky Town&quot; (1992). He reassembled the E Street Band for &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1995), and recorded the acoustic album &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; (1995) and the EP &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; (1996) solo.

Springsteen then released &quot;The Rising&quot; (2002), which was dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. He released two more folk albums, &quot;Devils &amp; Dust&quot; (2005) and &quot;We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions&quot; (2006), his first cover album. Springsteen followed with two more albums with the E Street Band, &quot;Magic&quot; (2007) and &quot;Working on a Dream&quot; (2009). His next albums, &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; (2012) and &quot;High Hopes&quot; (2014), topped album charts worldwide. In 2017, 2018 and 2021, Springsteen performed the critically acclaimed show &quot;Springsteen on Broadway&quot;, in which he performed songs and told stories from his 2016 autobiography; an album version from the Broadway performances was released in 2018. He released the solo &quot;Western Stars&quot; (2019), &quot;Letter to You&quot; (2020) with the E Street Band, and a solo covers album &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot; (2022). &quot;Letter to You&quot; reached No. 2 in the US, making Springsteen the first artist to release a top-five album across six consecutive decades.

One of the album era&#x27;s most prominent musicians, Springsteen has sold more than 71 million albums in the U.S. and over 140 million worldwide, making him the 27th-best-selling music artist of all time as of 2024. His accolades include 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, was named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 and the National Medal of Arts in 2023. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Springsteen 23rd on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, describing him as &quot;the embodiment of rock and roll&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Springsteen was born at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey, on September 23, 1949, to Douglas Frederick &quot;Dutch&quot; Springsteen (1924–1998) and his wife, Adele Ann (née Zerilli; 1925–2024). Springsteen&#x27;s father worked as a bus driver and other jobs. His father had mental health issues throughout his life, which worsened in his later life. His mother, who was originally from the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, worked as a legal secretary and was the family&#x27;s main breadwinner. He is of Dutch, Irish, and Italian descent, and grew up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey.

Springsteen&#x27;s paternal ancestors were among the early Dutch families who, in the 17th century, settled in colonial-era America, then part of the Dutch Republic known as New Netherland. Springsteen&#x27;s paternal ancestor, John Springsteen, was a patriot in the American Revolution, which evolved into the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The Springsteen surname originates in Groningen, a province in the Netherlands, and is topographic, translating to &quot;jump stone&quot; and meaning a used on unpaved streets or between two houses. Springsteen&#x27;s Italian maternal grandfather was born in Vico Equense and emigrated through Ellis Island. He arrived in the United States unable to read or write English, but went on to become a lawyer and impressed the young Springsteen as being &quot;larger than life&quot;.

Springsteen has two younger sisters, Virginia and Pamela (born 1962). Pamela Springsteen worked briefly as an actress and later as a photographer; she took photos for three Springsteen albums, &quot;Human Touch&quot;, &quot;Lucky Town&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;.

Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic School in Freehold, where he was at odds with the nuns and rebelled against the strictures imposed upon him, though some of his later music reflected a Catholic ethos and included Irish Catholic hymns with a rock music twist. In 2012, Springsteen said that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than his political ideology that most influenced his music. He said his faith gave him a &quot;very active spiritual life&quot; but joked that this &quot;made it very difficult sexually&quot; and added &quot;once a Catholic, always a Catholic&quot;. He grew up hearing fellow New Jersey singer Frank Sinatra on the radio, and became interested in being a musician by the age of seven after seeing Elvis Presley&#x27;s performances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1956 and 1957. Soon after, his mother rented him a guitar from Mike Diehl&#x27;s Music in Freehold for $6 a week, but it failed to provide him with the instant gratification he desired.

In ninth grade, Springsteen entered Freehold High School, a public high school, but did not fit in there either. A former teacher said Springsteen was a &quot;loner who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar&quot;. He graduated in 1967, but felt so alienated that he skipped his graduation ceremony. He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out. At age 19, Springsteen was drafted, but failed his physical examination because of a concussion he suffered in a motorcycle accident two years earlier combined with his behavior at induction, both of which reportedly made him unacceptable for military service. In failing his examination, Springsteen likely avoided conscripted service in the Vietnam War. In 1969, when he was 20 years old, Springsteen&#x27;s parents and sister Pamela moved to San Mateo, California; he and his sister Virginia, who was married and pregnant at the time, remained in Freehold.

==Career==
=== 1964–1972: Early career ===
In 1964, Springsteen saw the Beatles&#x27; televised appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Inspired, he bought his first guitar for $18.95 at the Western Auto appliance store. Thereafter, he started playing for audiences with a band called the Rogues at local venues, including Elks Lodge in Freehold. Later that year, his mother took out a loan to buy him a $60 Kent guitar, an act he later memorialized in his song &quot;The Wish&quot;. In 1965, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently one of the lead singers of the Castiles, a band that recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township and played a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion Vinyard said she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he would make it big. In the late 1960s, Springsteen performed briefly in a power trio known as Earth, who played in various clubs in New Jersey and at a major show at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City.

From 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed with the band Child, which later changed its name to Steel Mill and included Danny Federici, Vini Lopez, Vinnie Roslin, and later Steven Van Zandt and Robbin Thompson. Steel Mill performed at various Jersey Shore venues and also outside of New Jersey, in Richmond, Virginia, Nashville, Tennessee, and California, and gathered a cult following. In his January 1970 review of Steel Mill&#x27;s show at The Matrix, music critic Philip Elwood wrote in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; that he had &quot;never been so overwhelmed by a totally unknown talent&quot; and called Steel Mill &quot;the first big thing that&#x27;s happened to Asbury Park since the good ship &quot;Morro Castle&quot; burned to the waterline of that Jersey beach in &#x27;34&quot;. Elwood praised the band&#x27;s &quot;cohesive musicality&quot; and called Springsteen &quot;a most impressive composer&quot;. In San Mateo, Steel Mill recorded three original Springsteen songs at Pacific Recording.

As Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style, he performed with the bands Dr. Zoom &amp; the Sonic Boom from early-to-mid-1971, the Sundance Blues Band in mid-1971, and the Bruce Springsteen Band from mid-1971 to mid-1972. His songwriting ability included, as his future record label described it in early publicity campaigns, &quot;more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums&quot;. He brought his skills to the attention of several people who went on to prove influential to his career development, including managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, who in turn brought him to the attention of John Hammond, a talent scout at Columbia Records. In May 1972, Springsteen auditioned for Hammond.

In October 1972, Springsteen formed a new band for the recording of his debut album, &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; The band eventually became known as the E Street Band, although the name was not used until September 1974. Springsteen acquired the nickname &quot;the Boss&quot; during this period, since he took on the task of collecting his band&#x27;s nightly pay and distributing it among his bandmates. The nickname also reportedly sprang from games of &quot;Monopoly&quot;, which Springsteen played with other Jersey Shore musicians.

===1972–1974: Initial struggle===
Springsteen was signed to Columbia Records in 1972 by John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same label a decade earlier. Despite the expectations of Columbia Records&#x27; executives that Springsteen would record an acoustic album, he brought many of his New Jersey–based colleagues with him, who would later form the E Street Band, which the band formally named several months later. His debut album &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot;, was released in January 1973, and established him as a critical favorite, though sales were slow.

Because of Springsteen&#x27;s lyrical poeticism and folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and &quot;For You&quot;, and his connection with Hammond and Columbia Records, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. &quot;He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven&#x27;t heard since I was rocked by &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; magazine editor Peter Knobler wrote in a March 1973 profile of Springsteen&#x27;s that included photographs taken by Ed Gallucci. &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; was an early champion of Springsteen; Knobler profiled him in the magazine three times, in 1973, 1975, and 1978. In June 1976, Springsteen and the E Street Band acknowledged the magazine&#x27;s support by giving a private performance at the magazine&#x27;s 10th Anniversary Party in New York City.

Springsteen&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;, was released in November 1973, eleven months after &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park&quot;. Like Springsteen&#x27;s inaugural album, &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot; was met with critical acclaim but limited commercial success. Springsteen&#x27;s songs became grander in form and scope with the E Street Band providing a less folksy, more rhythm and blues vibe, and lyrics that romanticized teenage street life. &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; and &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; became fan favorites, while &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot; continues to rank among Springsteen&#x27;s most beloved concert numbers. &quot;Rosalita&quot; is the ninth-most played song in Springsteen&#x27;s concert catalog; as of June 2020, he has played it live 809 times.

In February 1974, The Stone Pony, a music venue and bar, opened on Ocean Avenue in Asbury Park, and Springsteen played there regularly. Several years later, in the early 1980s, prior to the start of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour in June 1984, Springsteen also met his second and current wife Patti Scialfa at The Stone Pony during her performance there. As a regular venue for Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Southside Johnny, and other local national acts, The Stone Pony has since been described as &quot;an integral part of music history for decades.&quot;

After seeing Springsteen&#x27;s performance at the Harvard Square Theater, music critic Jon Landau wrote in the May 22, 1974, issue of Boston&#x27;s &quot;The Real Paper&quot; that, &quot;I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen.&quot; Springsteen met Landau in Boston a month prior and the two became close friends; Landau subsequently became the co-producer of Springsteen&#x27;s next album, &quot;Born to Run&quot;, in February 1975. As Springsteen&#x27;s last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; production. When his manager, Mike Appel, orchestrated the release of an early mix of &quot;Born to Run&quot; to nearly a dozen radio stations, anticipation built toward the album&#x27;s release.

The album took over 14 months to record with six months spent recording &quot;Born to Run&quot; alone. E Street Band members David Sancious and Ernest Carter departed after &quot;Born to Run&quot; was completed, and were replaced by Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg on piano and drums, respectively. Springsteen battled with anger and frustration throughout the sessions, saying he heard &quot;sounds in [his] head&quot; that he could not explain to the others in the studio. He also dealt with two producers who had opposing views, which Springsteen had to meet in the middle of. During the recording of &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;, Steven Van Zandt conceived the horn parts for the horn players on the spot in the studio after Springsteen and Bittan had failed to write proper ones by the time the players arrived to record. He joined the E Street Band shortly after. Mixing for &quot;Born to Run&quot; lasted until July 20, 1975, just before a concert tour began.

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was mastered while the band was on the road. Springsteen was furious at the initial acetate, throwing it into the swimming pool of the hotel he was staying at. He contemplated scrapping the entire project and re-recording it live before he was stopped by Landau. Springsteen was sent multiple mixes as he was on the road and rejected all of them, approving the final one in early August.

===1975–1983: &quot;Born to Run&quot; and breakthrough success===
&quot;Born to Run&quot; was released in August 1975. It proved to be a breakthrough album that catapulted Springsteen to worldwide fame. The album peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, eventually going seven times platinum in the US. The album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; reached No. 23 and 83, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. According to author Louis Masur, the album&#x27;s success was tied to the fears of growing old held by a generation of late teenagers.

In October 1975, Springsteen appeared on the covers of both &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; in the same week, becoming the first artist to do so. The magazines&#x27; cover stories resulted in a media backlash, as critics began wondering if Springsteen was for real or the product of record company promotion. Springsteen was hurt by the backlash and disliked his newfound attention. When the E Street Band arrived in London for their first concerts outside North America, Springsteen personally tore down promotional posters in the lobby of the Hammersmith Odeon.
A legal battle with Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for nearly a year, during which time he kept the E Street Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. and continued writing new material. Reaching a settlement with Appel in May 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the subsequent nine-month recording sessions with the E Street Band produced &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;. The record stripped the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; production of &quot;Born to Run&quot; for a rawer hard rock sound. Its lyrics focus on ill-fortuned people who fight back against overwhelming odds.

Released in June 1978, &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; sold fewer copies than its predecessor, but remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for 167 weeks, selling three million copies in the U.S. Its three singles—&quot;Prove It All Night&quot;, &quot;Badlands&quot;, and &quot;The Promised Land&quot;—performed modestly. The supporting Darkness Tour was Springsteen&#x27;s largest up to that point and featured shows that lasted upwards of three hours in length. The staff of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; said the tour solidified Springsteen and the E Street Band as &quot;one of the most exciting live acts in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.
By the late 1970s, Springsteen earned a reputation as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band had achieved a U.S. No. 1 pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of &quot;Greetings&quot;″ &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; in early 1977. Patti Smith reached No. 13 with her version of Springsteen&#x27;s unreleased &quot;Because the Night&quot; with revised lyrics by Smith in 1978. The Pointer Sisters hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen&#x27;s then unreleased &quot;Fire&quot;. Between 1976 and 1978, Springsteen provided four compositions to Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, including &quot;The Fever&quot; and &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;, and collaborated on four more with Steven Van Zandt, producer of their first three albums.

In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent &quot;No Nukes&quot; live album, as well as the following summer&#x27;s &quot;No Nukes&quot; documentary film, represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen&#x27;s fabled live act and Springsteen&#x27;s first tentative dip into political involvement.

The recording sessions for Springsteen&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The River&quot;, lasted 18 months. The 20-track double album was an attempt at capturing the energy and feel of the E Street Band playing live on stage and featured a mix of party songs and introspective ballads. Released in October 1980, &quot;The River&quot; became Springsteen&#x27;s biggest and fastest-selling album yet, topping the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The single &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; became his first top ten single as a performer, reaching number five, while &quot;Fade Away&quot; reached No. 20.
Several songs on &quot;The River&quot; foreshadowed the direction of Springsteen&#x27;s next record, the minimalist, folk-inspired solo effort &quot;Nebraska&quot;, released in September 1982. Springsteen recorded the songs on the album as demo recordings at his home in Colts Neck, New Jersey, intending to re-record them with the E Street Band, but after poor test sessions he decided to release the recordings as is. The album chronicled dark hardships felt by everyday blue-collar workers, as well as bleak tales of criminals, cops, and gang wars. &quot;Nebraska&quot; sold minimally compared to Springsteen&#x27;s three previous albums, but reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Nevertheless, it surprised critics, who praised it as a brave artistic statement.

===1984–1986: &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; and cultural phenomenon===
In 1984, Springsteen released &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, which sold 30 million worldwide, and became one of the best-selling albums of all time, with seven singles hitting the top ten. The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans, some of whom were Springsteen&#x27;s friends. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics—except those in the chorus, which could be read many ways. The song made a huge political impact, as he was advocating for the rights of the common working-class man.
The song was widely misinterpreted as jingoistic, and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. In 1984, conservative columnist George Will attended a Springsteen concert and then wrote a column praising Springsteen&#x27;s work ethic. Six days after the column&#x27;s publication, then President Ronald Reagan, in a campaign rally in Hammonton, New Jersey, made brief mention of the song, saying, &quot;America&#x27;s future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire—New Jersey&#x27;s own, Bruce Springsteen.&quot; Two nights later, at a concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen told the crowd, &quot;Well, the president was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must&#x27;ve been, you know? I don&#x27;t think it was the &quot;Nebraska&quot; album. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s been listening to this one.&quot; He then began playing &quot;Johnny 99&quot;, with its allusions to closing factories and criminals.

&quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; was the biggest of seven hit singles from &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, peaking at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart. The video for the song showed a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen, which helped start the actress&#x27;s career. The song &quot;Cover Me&quot; was written by Springsteen for Donna Summer, but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A big fan of Summer&#x27;s work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, &quot;Protection&quot;. Videos for &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; were directed by Brian De Palma and John Sayles. Springsteen played on the &quot;We Are the World&quot; song and album in 1985. His live cover of the Jimmy Cliff song &quot;Trapped&quot; from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Rock Tracks chart.

The &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; period represented the height of Springsteen&#x27;s visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience he would ever reach (aided by the release of Arthur Baker&#x27;s dance mixes of three of the singles). From June 15 to August 10, 1985, all seven of his albums appeared on the UK Albums Chart: the first time an artist had charted their entire back catalogue simultaneously.

&quot;Live/1975–85&quot;, a five-record box set (also on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, ultimately selling 13 million units in the U.S. During the 1980s, several Springsteen fanzines were launched, including &quot;Backstreets&quot; magazine.

=== 1987–1991: &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; and activism ===
Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; in October 1987. The album is a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, and the full sound of the E Street Band is included only selectively. Although it sold less than &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, it was a commercial success, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.
On July 19, 1988, Springsteen&#x27;s concert in East Germany attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum called the concert &quot;the most important rock concert ever, anywhere&quot; in his 2013 book &quot;Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World&quot;. The concert had been conceived by the Socialist Unity Party&#x27;s youth wing in an attempt to placate the youth of East Germany, who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However, it is Kirschbaum&#x27;s opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in East Germany, and helped contribute to the fall of the Berlin Wall the following year.

Later in 1988, Springsteen headlined the worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. In October 1989, he dissolved the E Street Band.

===1992–1998: Academy award, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, and soundtracks===
In 1992, after risking fan accusations of &quot;going Hollywood&quot; by moving to Los Angeles and working with session musicians, Springsteen released two albums at once: &quot;Human Touch&quot; and &quot;Lucky Town&quot;.

An electric band appearance on the acoustic &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; television program (later released as &quot;In Concert/MTV Plugged&quot;) was poorly received and cemented fan dissatisfaction.

Springsteen won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. The video for the song shows Springsteen&#x27;s actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; video.

In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;), and also one show at Tramps in New York City, he released his second folk album, &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;. The album was inspired by John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and by &quot;Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass&quot;, a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson. The album was generally less well-received than the thematically similar &quot;Nebraska&quot; due to the minimal melody, twangy vocals, and political nature of most of the songs; however, some praised it for giving a voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed presented many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to &quot;shut the fuck up&quot; and not to clap during the performances.

Following that tour, Springsteen moved from California back to New Jersey with his family. In 1998, he released the sprawling, four-disc box set of outtakes, &quot;Tracks&quot;. Later, he would acknowledge that the 1990s were musically a &quot;lost period&quot; for him: &quot;I didn&#x27;t do a lot of work. Some people would say I didn&#x27;t do my best work.&quot;

===1999–2007: &quot;The Rising&quot;, &quot;Devils &amp; Dust&quot;, and other releases===
Springsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 by Bono (the lead singer of U2), a favor he returned in 2005.

In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band reunited and began their extensive Reunion Tour, which lasted over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey and a ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. A new song played at these shows, &quot;American Skin (41 Shots)&quot; (about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo), proved controversial.
In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, &quot;The Rising&quot;, produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien. The album, mostly a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular success. The title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen&#x27;s best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, The Rising Tour commenced; the band barnstormed through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe. Springsteen played an unprecedented 10 nights at Giants Stadium in New Jersey.

&quot;The Rising&quot; won the Grammy for Best Rock Album and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards in 2003. In addition, &quot;The Rising&quot; won the Grammy for Best Rock Song and for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, and nominated for Song of the Year. At the ceremony, Springsteen performed the Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt and No Doubt&#x27;s bassist, Tony Kanal, in tribute to Joe Strummer. In 2004, Springsteen and the E Street Band participated in the Vote for Change tour, with John Mellencamp, John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Bright Eyes, the Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, and other musicians.
The solo record &quot;Devils &amp; Dust&quot; was released in April 2005. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier, during or shortly after the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour; a few of the songs had been performed at that time but unreleased. The title track concerns an ordinary soldier&#x27;s feelings and fears during the Iraq War. The album topped the charts in ten countries. Springsteen began the solo Devils &amp; Dust Tour at the same time as the album&#x27;s release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and except in Europe tickets were easier to get than in the past.
In April 2006, Springsteen released &quot;We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions&quot;, an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. A tour began the same month, with the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed the Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to the Sessions Band). The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews, but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance.

Springsteen&#x27;s next album, &quot;Magic&quot;, was released in October 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it had 10 new Springsteen songs plus &quot;Long Walk Home&quot;, performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), &quot;Terry&#x27;s Song&quot;, a tribute to Springsteen&#x27;s long-time assistant Terry Magovern, who died in July 2007. &quot;Magic&quot; debuted at No. 1 in the U.S., Ireland and the UK. Springsteen supported the album on the Magic Tour, his first tour with the E Street Band since 2003. It was the final tour for longtime E Street member Danny Federici, who died in 2008.

===2008–2011: Political involvement, Super Bowl XLIII, and Kennedy Center Honors===

Springsteen supported Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. He gave solo acoustic performances in support of Obama&#x27;s campaign throughout 2008, culminating with a November 2 rally at which he debuted the song &quot;Working on a Dream&quot; in a duet with Scialfa. Following Obama&#x27;s electoral victory on November 4, Springsteen&#x27;s song &quot;The Rising&quot; was the first song played over the loudspeakers after Obama&#x27;s victory speech in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park. Springsteen was the musical opener for the Obama Inaugural Celebration on January 18, 2009, which was attended by over 400,000 people. He performed &quot;The Rising&quot; with an all-female choir. Later he performed Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; with Pete Seeger.

On January 11, 2009, Springsteen won the Golden Globe Award for Best Song for &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, from the Darren Aronofsky film by the same name. After receiving a heartfelt letter from lead actor Mickey Rourke, Springsteen supplied the song for the film for free.

Springsteen performed at the halftime show at Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, agreeing to perform after having declined on prior occasions. A few days before the game, Springsteen gave a rare press conference at which he promised a &quot;twelve-minute party.&quot; It has been reported that this press conference was Springsteen&#x27;s first press conference in more than 25 years. His 12-minute 45-second set, with the E Street Band and the Miami Horns, included abbreviated renditions of &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;, &quot;Born to Run&quot;, &quot;Working on a Dream&quot;, and &quot;Glory Days&quot;, the latter complete with football references in place of the original baseball-themed lyrics. The set of appearances and promotional activities led Springsteen to say, &quot;This has probably been the busiest month of my life.&quot;
&quot;Working on a Dream&quot;, dedicated to Federici, was released in late January 2009. The supporting Working on a Dream Tour ran from April to November 2009. The band performed five final shows at Giants Stadium, opening with a new song highlighting the historic stadium, and Springsteen&#x27;s Jersey roots, named &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;.

Springsteen received the Kennedy Center Honors on December 6, 2009. President Obama gave a speech in which he asserted that Springsteen had incorporated the lives of regular Americans into his expansive palette of songs. Obama added that Springsteen&#x27;s concerts were not just rock-and-roll concerts, but &quot;communions&quot;. The event included musical tributes from Melissa Etheridge, Ben Harper, John Mellencamp, Jennifer Nettles, Sting, and Eddie Vedder.

The 2000s ended with Springsteen named one of eight Artists of the Decade by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and with Springsteen&#x27;s tours ranking him fourth among artists in total concert grosses for the decade.

Clarence Clemons, the E Street Band&#x27;s saxophonist and founding member, died on June 18, 2011, of complications from a stroke.

It was announced on July 23, 2019, that Springsteen would premiere his film, &quot;Western Stars&quot;, at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2019. He co-directed the film along with longtime collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features Springsteen and his backing band performing the music from &quot;Western Stars&quot; to a live audience.

The event marked the first music performance without an in-person audience at a major U.S. arena, stadium or ballpark during the COVID-19 pandemic. The livestream attracted over 9 million viewers and raised over $700,000 through charitable donations.

Springsteen&#x27;s twentieth studio album, &quot;Letter to You&quot;, was released in October 2020. An accompanying documentary of the same name was released the same month. The documentary was shot exclusively in black and white and was directed by Thom Zimny. The album was supported by two singles, &quot;Letter to You&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot;, released in September. In November, Springsteen was featured as a guest singer for Bleachers&#x27; single, &quot;Chinatown&quot;.

Springsteen and the E Street Band were musical guests on the December 12, 2020, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where they performed &quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot;. This marked the band&#x27;s first performance since 2017 and their first to promote &quot;Letter to You&quot;. Garry Tallent and Soozie Tyrell opted to remain at home due to COVID-19 concerns; this was the first time Tallent had ever missed a performance with the band, and Jack Daley of the Disciples of Soul filled in for him.

In February 2021, it was announced that Springsteen was releasing an eight-part podcast on Spotify titled &quot;&quot; that would feature himself in conversation with Barack Obama discussing a wide range of topics including family, race, marriage, fatherhood, and the state of the U.S. Springsteen performed co-lead vocals and guitar on John Mellencamp&#x27;s song &quot;Wasted Days&quot;, released in September 2021.

On June 7, 2021, Springsteen announced that his &quot;Springsteen on Broadway&quot; shows would return for a limited run at Jujamcyn&#x27;s St. James Theatre beginning on June 26, 2021. In an interview with E Street Radio&#x27;s Jim Rotolo on June 10, 2021, Springsteen said that he did not plan on playing any shows in 2021 but was talked into the Broadway shows by a &quot;friend&quot;. During the same interview, Springsteen also announced an upcoming collaboration with the Killers. Later that day the Killers&#x27; social media announced the title of the song &quot;Dustland&quot; after a series of teases by the band throughout the day.

On September 11, 2021, Springsteen performed &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot; in tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks.

On December 13, 2021, Springsteen gave a surprise four song performance at the John Henry&#x27;s Friends benefit concert for children diagnosed with Autism where he was joined by Steve Earle and the Dukes as his backing band. On December 16, 2021, Springsteen sold the masters of his entire catalog and the coinciding music publishing rights to Sony Music for $500 million. This topped what Bob Dylan and Taylor Swift received for their catalogs by $200 million. This sale, along with his Broadway shows and projects with Obama, helped him top the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the highest-paid musicians of 2021.

===Since 2022: &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot;, collaborations, and touring===

On May 24, 2022, it was announced that he would be launching an international tour with the E Street Band in 2023, the first such since 2017. On September 29, Springsteen and Patti Scialfa performed at the inaugural Albie Awards at the New York Public Library. In November, Springsteen released his twenty-first studio album, &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot;, a covers album of classic soul music songs from the 1960s and 1970s. It was preceded by the singles &quot;Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)&quot;, &quot;Nightshift&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song&quot; and &quot;Turn Back the Hands of Time&quot;. To promote the album, Springsteen performed on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; on November 14, 15 and 16, 2022, along with a special Thanksgiving episode on November 24, 2022.

On February 1, 2023, Springsteen and the E Street band launched their first tour in six years, due to conclude in July 2025. On June 15, 2023, former E Street Band member David Sancious, who left the band in 1974, said that he is set to appear on a follow-up to &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot; and that Springsteen has completed 18 songs for the album. Sancious said he expects to tour with Springsteen to support the album in 2024. In a November 2022 interview, Springsteen confirmed that he planned a Volume 2 of the album; at the time, he said it was &quot;probably three-quarters recorded&quot;.

Springsteen provided vocals on the song &quot;History Books&quot; by the Gaslight Anthem, the title track on the band&#x27;s October 2023 album. The same month, he collaborated with Bryce Dessner on &quot;Addicted to Romance&quot;, an original song for the &quot;She Came to Me&quot; soundtrack album. In September, Springsteen announced the postponement of eight shows scheduled for September. Springsteen was undergoing treatment for peptic ulcer disease and doctors recommended he not perform live. A few days later, the remaining twelve shows scheduled for November through December 2023 were also postponed to dates in March and April, and between August and November 2024. In total, twenty-nine shows on the tour have been postponed due to Springsteen&#x27;s illness along with Springsteen and other members of the band having COVID-19.

In April 2024, 20th Century Studios announced a biographical film, &quot;Deliver Me from Nowhere&quot;, based on the 2023 book by Warren Zanes about the making of &quot;Nebraska&quot;. It is written and directed by Scott Cooper; Jeremy Allen White will play Springsteen and perform his own singing. That year, Springsteen contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. His eighth compilation album, &quot;Best of Bruce Springsteen&quot;, was released on April 19. In October, Disney+ and Hulu released a documentary about Springsteen&#x27;s 2023–2024 tour, &quot;Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band&quot;. The documentary made its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2024. In July 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that Springsteen had a net worth of more than $1.1 billion, thanks to his tours and the sale of his back catalogue in 2021, making him one of the richest celebrities and musicians. During his August 23, 2024, show in Philadelphia, Springsteen denounced rumors of a farewell tour.

==Artistry and legacy==
Widely regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Springsteen has been called a &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll poet&quot; who &quot;[radiates] working-class authenticity&quot;. He is a pioneer of heartland rock, a genre combining mainstream rock music with working class thematic concerns and socially conscious lyrics. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, his work &quot;epitomizes rock&#x27;s deepest values: desire, the need for freedom and the search to find yourself.&quot; Often described as cinematic in their scope, Springsteen&#x27;s lyrics frequently explore highly personal themes such as individual commitment, dissatisfaction and dismay with life in a context of everyday situations. Springsteen&#x27;s themes include social and political commentary and are rooted in the struggles faced by his own family of origin.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included &quot;Born to Run&quot; (18), &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (85), &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot; (132), &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; (151), &quot;Nebraska&quot; (224), &quot;The River&quot; (250), &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; (379), and &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; (475). In 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Born to Run&quot; (21), &quot;Thunder Road&quot; (86), and &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (275).

A shift in Springsteen&#x27;s lyrical approach began with the album &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;, in which he focused on the emotional struggles of working class life, alongside more typical rock and roll themes. Reviewing &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Debby Miller noted that &quot;Springsteen ignored the British Invasion and embraced instead the legacy of Phil Spector&#x27;s releases, the sort of soul that was coming from Atlantic Records, and especially the garage bands that had anomalous radio hits. He&#x27;s always chased the utopian feeling of that music&quot;.
Jon Pareles included Springsteen among the &quot;pantheon&quot; of artists of the album era. &quot;Springsteen is the quintessential album-era rock star,&quot; writes Ann Powers, who argues that while other acts like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Marvin Gaye probably made better individual works, &quot;none [had] used the long-player form itself more powerfully over the arc of a career, not only to establish a world through song, but to inhabit an enduring persona&quot;. He used it to lyricize &quot;America&#x27;s slide from industrial-era swagger into service-economy anomie&quot;. In her mind, Springsteen needed the &quot;track-by-track architecture of albums to flesh out characters, relate each to the other, extend metaphors and build a palpable, detail-strewn landscape through which they could travel&quot;. He simultaneously grew musically &quot;both with his stalwart E Street Band (a metaphor itself for the family connections and community spirit his songs celebrate or lament) and in more minimalist projects.&quot;

Springsteen and the E Street Band have frequently appeared in lists ranking the best live acts of all time. In &quot;Forbes&quot;, Steve Baltin wrote: &quot;There has never been a live experience in music that captures the feeling of liberation and optimism rock and roll is supposed to bring you more than a Springsteen and the E Street Band show.&quot; In January 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Springsteen the 77th-greatest singer of all time. In April 2023, the governor of New Jersey issued a proclamation announcing September 23 &quot;Bruce Springsteen Day&quot;.

Springsteen&#x27;s songs have been the subject of various scholarly articles analyzing his music and lyrics. The Bruce Springsteen Special Collection houses academic journals and papers on Springsteen published since the 1980s. Springsteen himself said in 2001: &quot;The Collection has almost 1,000 books and magazines on myself and the band–more stuff than every place except my mother&#x27;s basement!&quot;

==Personal life==
===Relationships===

Springsteen briefly dated artist Karon Bihari in the 1970s, who claimed the &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; song &quot;Candy&#x27;s Room&quot; was about her. He also had relationships with photographer Lynn Goldsmith, model Karen Darvin and, for four years in the 1980s, actress Joyce Hyser.

In the early 1980s, he met Patti Scialfa at The Stone Pony, a bar and music venue in Asbury Park, New Jersey, the evening she was performing alongside his friend Bobby Bandiera, with whom she wrote &quot;At Least We Got Shoes&quot; for Southside Johnny. Springsteen liked her voice and after the performance he introduced himself to her. They soon started spending time together and became friends.

Early in 1984, Springsteen asked Scialfa to join the E Street Band for the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, which began in June 1984. According to the book &quot;Bruce&quot; by Peter Ames Carlin, they seemed about to become a couple through the first leg of the tour, but Springsteen was introduced to actress Julianne Phillips and married her shortly after midnight on May 13, 1985, at Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Opposites in background, the two had an 11-year age difference and Springsteen&#x27;s traveling took its toll on their relationship. Many of the songs on &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; described the unhappiness he felt in his relationship with Phillips.

The Tunnel of Love Express Tour began in February 1988 and Springsteen convinced Scialfa to postpone her own solo record and join the tour. Scialfa moved in with Springsteen shortly after he separated from Phillips. On August 30, 1988, citing irreconcilable differences, Phillips filed for divorce in Los Angeles, and a settlement was reached in December and finalized on March 1, 1989. They had no children.

Springsteen received press criticism for the apparent haste in which he and Scialfa started their relationship. In a 1995 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, he told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received: &quot;It&#x27;s a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn&#x27;t. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, &#x27;Well, all I know is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going here in some fashion, but that&#x27;s life.&#x27;&quot; Years later, he reflected, &quot;&#x27;I didn&#x27;t protect Juli... some sort of public announcement would have been fair, but I felt overly concerned about my own privacy. I handled it badly, and I still feel badly about it. It was cruel for people to find out the way they did.&#x27;&quot;

Springsteen and Scialfa lived in New Jersey before moving to Los Angeles, where they decided to start a family. On July 25, 1990, Scialfa gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, Evan James Springsteen. On June 8, 1991, Springsteen and Scialfa married at their Los Angeles home in a private ceremony, only attended by family and close friends. Their second child, Jessica Rae Springsteen, was born on December 30, 1991. Their third child, Samuel Ryan Springsteen, was born on January 5, 1994. In a 1995 interview, Springsteen said, &quot;I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, &#x27;Hey, what does it matter?&#x27; But it does matter. It&#x27;s very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly—which is what you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals—is a part of your place in society and in some way part of society&#x27;s acceptance of you ... Patti and I both found that it did mean something.&quot;

When their children reached school age in the 1990s, Springsteen and Scialfa moved back to New Jersey to raise them away from paparazzi. The family owns and lives on a horse farm in Colts Neck Township and has a home in Rumson; they also own homes in Los Angeles and Wellington, Florida. Evan graduated from Boston College; he writes and performs his own songs and won the 2012 Singer/Songwriter Competition held during Boston College&#x27;s Arts Festival. Jessica graduated from Duke University and is a nationally ranked champion equestrian. She made her show-jumping debut with Team USA in August 2014. Sam is a firefighter in Jersey City. On July 17, 2022, Springsteen and Scialfa became grandparents when their son Sam and his fiancée had a daughter.

===Health===
Springsteen has avoided hard drugs his entire life. Van Zandt said in 2012, &quot;[Springsteen is] the only guy I know—I think the only guy I know at all—who never did drugs.&quot; He has spoken about his struggles with depression, which he began to address in his 30s after years of denial. During this time, he also became frustrated with being an underweight &quot;fast food junkie&quot; who had to be helped off the stage after a show due to his poor health. He later began following a mostly vegetarian diet while running up to six miles on a treadmill and lifting weights three times a week. A 2019 &quot;Consequence&quot; article celebrating his 70th birthday revealed that he still maintains this routine and diet. In September 2023, Springsteen announced the postponement of all his concerts in the US beginning in that month and through December, due to his ongoing treatment for peptic ulcer disease.

===Views===
While rejecting religion in his earlier years, Springsteen stated in his 2016 autobiography &quot;Born to Run&quot;, &quot;I have a personal relationship with Jesus. I believe in his power to save, love [...] but not to damn.&quot; In terms of his lapsed Catholicism, he said that he &quot;came to ruefully and bemusedly understand that once you&#x27;re a Catholic you&#x27;re always a Catholic ... I don&#x27;t participate in my religion but I know somewhere... deep inside... I&#x27;m still on the team.&quot;

In a 2017 interview with Tom Hanks, Springsteen admitted that he evaded taxes early in his career since the government had not paid attention to his taxes prior to his 1975 appearance on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. Most of his income over the next several years went towards paying back his taxes; by his 30th birthday, he had only $20,000, despite multiple bestselling records and tours.

==Political views and activism==

Springsteen supported Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign, announcing his endorsement in April 2008. He appeared at several rallies in support of Obama&#x27;s campaign throughout that year. At one such rally in Ohio, Springsteen discussed the importance of &quot;truth, transparency and integrity in government, the right of every American to have a job, a living wage, to be educated in a decent school, and a life filled with the dignity of work, the promise and the sanctity of home&quot;. Despite saying that he would sit out the 2012 presidential election, Springsteen campaigned for Obama&#x27;s re-election in Ohio, Iowa, Virginia, Pittsburgh, and Wisconsin. The Topps company marked Springsteen&#x27;s support of the 2008 campaign its Barack Obama commemorative trading card series, in which Springsteen makes an appearance on card #59, &quot;the &#x27;O&#x27; Street Band.&quot;

Springsteen supports LGBT rights and has spoken out in support of gay marriage. In an April 1996 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, an LGBT magazine, he said, &quot;You get your license, you do all the social rituals. It&#x27;s part of your place in society, and in some way part of society&#x27;s acceptance of you.&quot; In 2009, he posted the following statement on his website: &quot;I&#x27;ve long believed in and have always spoken out for the rights of same sex couples and fully agree with Governor Corzine when he writes that &#x27;The marriage-equality issue should be recognized for what it truly is—a civil rights issue that must be approved to assure that every citizen is treated equally under the law. In 2012, he lent his support to an ad campaign for gay marriage called &quot;The Four 2012&quot;. Springsteen noted in the ad, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t agree more with that statement and urge those who support equal treatment for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to let their voices be heard now.&quot; In April 2016, Springsteen cancelled a show in Greensboro, North Carolina, days before it was to take place to protest the state&#x27;s newly passed Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act, also referred to as the &quot;bathroom law&quot;, which dictates which restrooms transgender people are permitted to use and prevents LGBT citizens from suing over human rights violations in the workplace. Springsteen released an official statement on his website. The Human Rights Campaign celebrated Springsteen&#x27;s statement, and he has received praise and gratitude from the LGBT community.

During a 2017 show in Perth, Australia, Springsteen made a statement celebrating the post-inauguration Women&#x27;s March against the incoming Trump administration in cities worldwide: &quot;We&#x27;re a long way from home, and our hearts and spirits are with the hundreds of thousands of women and men that marched yesterday in every city in America, and in Melbourne ... [They] rallied against hate and division and in support of tolerance, inclusion, reproductive rights, civil rights, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, the environment, wage equality, gender equality, healthcare, and immigrant rights. We stand with you. We are the new American resistance.&quot;

Springsteen was a staunch critic of Donald Trump throughout his presidency. In October 2019, Springsteen said Trump &quot;doesn&#x27;t have a grasp of the deep meaning of what it means to be an American,&quot; and in June 2020 called him a &quot;threat to our democracy&quot;. Springsteen&#x27;s song &quot;The Rising&quot; was featured prominently in the 2020 Democratic National Convention in support of Joe Biden, accompanied with a new video and campaign slogan, #TheRising. On October 13, 2020, author Don Winslow released a video critical of Trump prior to his campaign event in Pennsylvania. The video features Springsteen&#x27;s song &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;. A few days prior to the 2020 United States presidential election, Springsteen provided narration for a campaign ad that spotlights Biden&#x27;s upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania with &quot;My Hometown&quot; playing throughout the ad. Biden used &quot;We Take Care of Our Own&quot; as one of his theme songs, as Obama had before him in 2012. On October 3, 2024, Springsteen endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election, and gave a speech at one of her campaign rallies on October 24.

== Achievements and awards ==

Springsteen has sold more than 140 million records worldwide and more than 71 million records in the United States, making him one of the world&#x27;s best-selling artists. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award (for &quot;Springsteen on Broadway&quot;). Springsteen was inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, was named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2016.

In May 2021, Springsteen became the eighth recipient of the Woody Guthrie Prize, a prize that honors an artist who speaks out for social justice and carries on the spirit of the folk singer. In March 2023, Springsteen was awarded the 2021 National Medal of Arts from President Joe Biden at the White House. Springsteen was supposed to receive the award in 2021 but the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the ceremonies.

In March 2024, it was announced that Springsteen would be named an Academy Fellow by The Ivors Academy in May 2024. On May 23, 2024, Springsteen became the first international songwriter that the Academy has inducted into the Fellowship in its 80-year history.

<text>The Karmapa [[Tulku]] lineage of the Gyalwa Karmapa is the oldest among the major incarnating lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, established in 1110 CE by the 1st Karmapa, Düsum Khyenpa.
Karmapa means “the one who carries out buddha-activity”, or “the embodiment of all the activities of the buddhas.” A total of 17 Karmapa manifestations have incarnated after their predecessors predict their own rebirths in detailed letters.

Their honorific titles include His Holiness the Gyalwa Karmapa (, and more formally as Gyalwang () The Karmapa is the head of the Karma Kagyu, the largest sub-school of the Kagyu school (), itself one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. 

The main seat of the four Tibetan seats of the Karmapas is the Tsurphu Monastery in U-Tsang, along the Tolung valley of central Tibet. The Karmapa&#x27;s seat built during the Tibetan diaspora is the Dharma Chakra Centre at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, India. The international monastic seats are Karma Triyana Dharmachakra in New York and Dhagpo Kagyu Ling in Dordogne, France, and in Dominica.

Born in 1985, it was a few years after the 17th Karmapa, Orgyen Trinley Dorje was located and then recognized in 1992 by the Dalai Lama, and by the Chinese Central Government, that another Karmapa was recognized by Shamar Rinpoche, Trinley Thaye Dorje. The identity of the current 17th Karmapa was resolved by the Karmapas themselves, Orgyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje, both of whom issued a joint statement on 04 December 2023.

==Origin of the lineage==
Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama (, 1110–1193), was a disciple of the Tibetan master Gampopa. A talented child who studied Buddhism with his father from an early age and who sought out great teachers in his twenties and thirties, he is said to have attained enlightenment at the age of fifty while practicing dream yoga. He was henceforth regarded by the contemporary highly respected masters Shakya Śri and Lama Shang as the Karmapa, a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara, whose coming was predicted in the &quot;Samadhiraja Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;.

The source of the oral lineage, traditionally traced back to the Buddha Vajradhara, was transmitted to the Indian master of mahamudra and tantra called Tilopa (989–1069), through Naropa (1016–1100) to Marpa Lotsawa and Milarepa. These forefathers of the Kagyu (Bka&#x27; brGyud) lineage are collectively called the &quot;Golden Rosary&quot;.

==Recognition of the Karmapa==

The Karmapa is a long line of consciously reborn lamas, and the second Karmapa, Karma Pakshi (1204–1283), is the first recognized tulku () in Tibetan Buddhism who predicted the circumstances of his rebirth.

A Karmapa&#x27;s identity is confirmed through a combination realized lineage teachers supernatural insight, prediction letters left by the previous Karmapa, and the young child&#x27;s own self-proclamation and ability to identify objects and people known to its previous incarnation.

===Conflicts in recognitions===

The 8th, 10th, and 12th incarnations, as well as the widely renowned 16th Karmapa, each faced conflicts during their recognition, which were ultimately resolved. There is currently a controversy over the enthronement of two 17th Karmapas.

==Black Crown==
The Karmapas are the holders of the Black Crown () and are thus sometimes known as &quot;the Black Hat Lamas&quot;. This crown ( &quot;self-arisen crown&quot;), is traditionally said to have been woven by the dakinis from their hair and given to the Karmapa in recognition of his spiritual realization. The physical crown displayed by the Karmapas was offered to Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama by the Yongle Emperor of China as a material representation of the spiritual one.

The crown was last known to be located at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, the last home of the 16th Karmapa, although that location has been subject to some upheaval since 1993 causing some to worry as to whether or not it is still there. An inventory of items remaining at Rumtek is purported to be something the Indian government is going to undertake in the near future.

<text>The Castle of Crossed Destinies () is a 1973 novel by Italian writer Italo Calvino.

==Background==
The novel is in two parts, each using a different style of tarot deck. The first part was published alone in 1969 as &quot;Tarocchi: Il mazzo visconteo di Bergamo e New York&quot; (Tarots: The Visconti Pack in Bergamo and New York). It contains allusions to Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. The second part, with the header &quot;The Tavern of Crossed Destinies&quot;, features the Tarot of Marseilles.

==Synopsis==
The narrative details a meeting among travelers who are inexplicably unable to speak after passing through a forest. The characters in the novel recount their tales via tarot cards, which are reconstructed by the narrator. The deck scatters at the end of the novel, as do the characters&#x27; identities.

==Themes==
The novel is an exploration of how meaning is created, whether that be written via words (by the author, via the book, since the characters in the book cannot speak to each other), or by images (the tarot cards—considered prophetic by some, and themselves open to many symbolic interpretations). It is, as often in Calvino&#x27;s works, multilayered, and several levels of interpretations and readings are possible, based on the author–narrator–character–reader relationship.

<doc id="60198" wikidata="Q1032190" url="?curid=60198" title="If on a winter's night a traveler">
<text>If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler () is a 1979 novel by the Italian writer Italo Calvino. The postmodernist narrative, in the form of a frame story, is about the reader trying to read a book called &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler&quot;. Each chapter is divided into two sections. The first section of each chapter is in second person, and describes the process the reader goes through to attempt to read the next chapter of the book they are reading. The second half is the first part of a new book that the reader (&quot;you&quot;) finds. The second half is always about something different from the previous ones. The book was published in an English translation by William Weaver in 1981.

== Structure ==

The book begins with a chapter on the art and nature of reading, and is subsequently divided into twenty-two passages. The odd-numbered passages and the final passage are narrated in the second person. That is, they concern events purportedly happening to the novel&#x27;s reader. (Some contain further discussions about whether the person narrated as &quot;you&quot; is the same as the &quot;you&quot; who is actually reading.) These chapters concern the reader&#x27;s adventures in reading Italo Calvino&#x27;s novel, &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler.&quot; Eventually the reader meets a woman named Ludmilla, who is also addressed in her own chapter, separately, and also in the second person.

Alternating between second-person narrative chapters of this story are the remaining (even) passages, each of which is a first chapter in ten different novels, of widely varying style, genre, and subject-matter. All are broken off, for various reasons explained in the interspersed passages, most of them at some moment of plot climax.

The second-person narrative passages develop into a fairly cohesive novel that puts its two protagonists on the track of an international book-fraud conspiracy, a mischievous translator, a reclusive novelist haunted by advertisers who wish to embed products in his stories and programmers who demand to let a computer generate the conclusion to his unfinished novels, a collapsing publishing house, and several repressive governments.

The chapters, which are the first chapters of different books, all push the narrative chapters along. Themes which are introduced in each of the first chapters will then exist in succeeding narrative chapters. For example, after reading the first chapter of a detective novel, the narrative story takes on a few common detective-style themes. There are also phrases and descriptions that are similar between the narrative and the new stories.

When the titles of the fragmentary fictions are read in order—as they are by a character near the end of the narrative—they form a sentence:

The theme of a writer&#x27;s objectivity appears also in Calvino&#x27;s novel &quot;Mr. Palomar&quot;, which explores if absolute objectivity is possible, or even agreeable. Other themes include the subjectivity of meaning, the relationship between fiction and life, what makes an ideal reader and author, and authorial originality.

=== Cimmeria ===

Cimmeria is a fictional country in the novel. The country is described as having existed as an independent state between World War I and World War II. The capital is Örkko, and its principal resources are peat and by-products, bituminous compounds. Cimmeria seems to have been located somewhere on the Gulf of Bothnia, a body of water between Sweden to the west and Finland to the east. The country has since been absorbed, and its people and language, of the &#x27;Bothno-Ugaric&#x27; group, have both disappeared. As Calvino concludes the alleged, fictional encyclopedia entry concerning Cimmeria: &quot;In successive territorial divisions between her powerful neighbors the young nation was soon erased from the map; the population was dispersed; Cimmerian language and culture had no development&quot;.

The pair of chapters following the two on Cimmeria and its literature are followed by one describing another fictional country called the Cimbrian People&#x27;s Republic, which allegedly absorbed Cimmeria after World War II.

== Characters ==

The main character in the first part of each chapter is you, the reader. The narrative starts out when you begin reading a book but then all of the pages are out of order. You then go to a bookstore to get a new copy of the book. When at the bookstore, you meet a girl, Ludmilla, who becomes an important character in the book. You think Ludmilla is beautiful, and you both share a love of books. Throughout the rest of the narrative, you and Ludmilla develop a relationship while on the quest for the rest of the book you had started reading. There are a number of minor characters that appear at various points in the story including Lotaria (Ludmilla&#x27;s sister), Ermes Marana (a translation scammer), and Silas Flannery (an author).

== Influences ==

In a 1985 interview with Gregory Lucente, Calvino stated &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler&quot; was &quot;clearly&quot; influenced by the writings of Vladimir Nabokov. The book was also influenced by the author&#x27;s membership in the literary group Oulipo. The structure of the text is said to be an adaptation of the structural semiology of A. J. Greimas.

In a letter written to critic Lucio Lombardo Radice dated November 13, 1979 (published in &quot;Italo Calvino: letters, 1941–1985&quot;), Calvino mentions Mikhail Bulgakov, Yasunari Kawabata, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, Juan Rulfo, José María Arguedas, Jorge Luis Borges and G. K. Chesterton as having influenced, in various ways, the narrative style of the ten stories that comprise the book.

== Legacy and opinion ==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #45, and declared it &quot;a splendidly batty book about books. [...] Offbeat and fun.&quot;

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; included the novel in 69th place in a list of &quot;100 novels everyone should read&quot; in 2009, describing it as a &quot;playful postmodernist puzzle&quot;.

Author David Mitchell described himself as being &quot;magnetised&quot; by the book from its start when he read it as an undergraduate, but on rereading it, felt it had aged and that he did not find it &quot;breathtakingly inventive&quot; as he had the first time, yet does stress that &quot;however breathtakingly inventive a book is, it is only breathtakingly inventive once&quot; – with once being better than never.

Novelist and lecturer Scarlett Thomas uses it to teach innovative contemporary fiction, as an example of different kinds of narrative techniques.

Sting named his 2009 album &quot;If on a Winter&#x27;s Night...&quot; after the book.

English musician and composer Bill Ryder-Jones released the album &quot;If...&quot; on 14 November 2011. The album is a musical adaptation of the book and serves as an &quot;imaginary film score&quot;.

The 2021 video game &quot;If on a Winter&#x27;s Night, Four Travelers&quot; was named after the book.

A radio adaptation of the book starring Toby Jones, Indira Varma and Tim Crouch was recorded as part of BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 years of Radio Drama Celebrations&quot; and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 24 Sep 2023.

In the version 2.0 of the game Wuthering Waves Carlotta Montelli&#x27;s companion quest &quot;If On A Rainy Night A Family&quot; references the book.

<doc id="60203" wikidata="Q5589" url="?curid=60203" title="Henri Matisse">
<text>Henri Émile Benoît Matisse (; 31 December 1869 – 3 November 1954) was a French visual artist, known for both his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. He was a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter.

Matisse is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso, as one of the artists who best helped to define the revolutionary developments in the visual arts throughout the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture.

The intense colourism of the works he painted between 1900 and 1905 brought him notoriety as one of the Fauves (French for &quot;wild beasts&quot;). Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so after 1906, when he developed a rigorous style that emphasized flattened forms and decorative pattern. In 1917, he relocated to a suburb of Nice on the French Riviera, and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting. After 1930, he adopted a bolder simplification of form. When ill health in his final years prevented him from painting, he created an important body of work in the medium of cut paper collage.

His mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in modern art.

==Early life and education==

Matisse was born in Le Cateau-Cambrésis, in the Nord department in Northern France on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1869, the oldest son of a wealthy grain merchant. He grew up in Bohain-en-Vermandois, Picardie. In 1887, he went to Paris to study law, working as a court administrator in Le Cateau-Cambrésis after gaining his qualification. He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of appendicitis. He discovered &quot;a kind of paradise&quot; as he later described it, and decided to become an artist, deeply disappointing his father.

In 1891, he returned to Paris to study art at the under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts under Gustave Moreau. Initially he painted still lifes and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency. Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, Nicolas Poussin, and Antoine Watteau, as well as by modern artists, such as Édouard Manet, and by Japanese art. Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin&#x27;s paintings in the Louvre.

In 1896, Matisse, an unknown art student at the time, visited the Australian painter John Russell on the island of Belle Île off the coast of Brittany. Russell introduced him to Impressionism and to the work of Vincent van Gogh—who had been a friend of Russell—and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Matisse&#x27;s style changed completely: abandoning his earth-coloured palette for bright colours. He later said Russell was his teacher, and that Russell had explained colour theory to him. The same year, Matisse exhibited five paintings in the salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, two of which were purchased by the state.With the model Caroline Joblau, he had a daughter, Marguerite, born in 1894. In 1898, he married Amélie Noellie Parayre; the two raised Marguerite together and had two sons, Jean (born 1899) and Pierre (born 1900). Marguerite and Amélie often served as models for Matisse.

In 1898, on the advice of Camille Pissarro, he went to London to study the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and then went on a trip to Corsica. Upon his return to Paris in February 1899, he worked beside Albert Marquet and met André Derain, Jean Puy, and Jules Flandrin. Matisse immersed himself in the work of others and went into debt from buying work from painters he admired. The work he hung and displayed in his home included a plaster bust by Rodin, a painting by Gauguin, a drawing by Van Gogh, and Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Three Bathers&quot;. In Cézanne&#x27;s sense of pictorial structure and colour, Matisse found his main inspiration.

Many of Matisse&#x27;s paintings from 1898 to 1901 make use of a Divisionist technique he adopted after reading Paul Signac&#x27;s essay, &quot;&quot;.

In May 1902, Amélie&#x27;s parents became ensnared in a major financial scandal, the Humbert Affair. Her mother (who was the Humbert family&#x27;s housekeeper) and father became scapegoats in the scandal, and her family was menaced by angry mobs of fraud victims. According to art historian Hilary Spurling, &quot;their public exposure, followed by the arrest of his father-in-law, left Matisse as the sole breadwinner for an extended family of seven.&quot; During 1902 to 1903, Matisse adopted a style of painting that was comparatively somber and concerned with form, a change possibly intended to produce saleable works during this time of material hardship. Having made his first attempt at sculpture, a copy after Antoine-Louis Barye, in 1899, he devoted much of his energy to working in clay, completing &quot;The Slave&quot; in 1903.

===Early paintings===
==Fauvism==
Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910. The movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were Matisse and André Derain. Matisse&#x27;s first solo exhibition was at Ambroise Vollard&#x27;s gallery in 1904, without much success. His fondness for bright and expressive colour became more pronounced after he spent the summer of 1904 painting in St. Tropez with the neo-Impressionists Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross. In that year, he painted the most important of his works in the neo-Impressionist style, &quot;Luxe, Calme et Volupté&quot;. In 1905, he travelled southwards again to work with André Derain at Collioure. His paintings of this period are characterised by flat shapes and controlled lines, using pointillism in a less rigorous way than before.

Matisse and a group of artists now known as &quot;Fauves&quot; exhibited together in a room at the Salon d&#x27;Automne in 1905. The paintings expressed emotion with wild, often dissonant colours, without regard for the subject&#x27;s natural colours. Matisse showed &quot;Open Window&quot; and &quot;Woman with the Hat&quot; at the Salon. Critic Louis Vauxcelles commented on a lone sculpture surrounded by an &quot;orgy of pure tones&quot; as &quot;Donatello chez les fauves&quot; (Donatello among the wild beasts), referring to a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them. His comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in &quot;Gil Blas&quot;, a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage. The exhibition garnered harsh criticism—&quot;A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public&quot;, said the critic Camille Mauclair—but also some favourable attention. When the painting that was singled out for special condemnation, Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Woman with a Hat&quot;, was bought by Gertrude and Leo Stein, the embattled artist&#x27;s morale improved considerably.

Matisse was recognised as a leader of the Fauves, along with André Derain; the two were friendly rivals, each with his own followers. Other members were Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, and Maurice de Vlaminck. The Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau (1826–1898) was the movement&#x27;s inspirational teacher. As a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.

In 1907, Guillaume Apollinaire, commenting about Matisse in an article published in &quot;La Falange&quot;, wrote, &quot;We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse&#x27;s art is eminently reasonable.&quot; But Matisse&#x27;s work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family. His painting &quot;Nu bleu&quot; (1907) was burned in effigy at the Armory Show in Chicago in 1913.

The decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in Montparnasse, even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict bourgeois work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to Algeria in 1906 studying African art and Primitivism. After viewing a large exhibition of Islamic art in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited Morocco in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in Tangier he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour. The effect on Matisse&#x27;s art was a new boldness in the use of intense, unmodulated colour, as in &quot;L&#x27;Atelier Rouge&quot; (1911).

Matisse had a long association with the Russian art collector Sergei Shchukin. He created one of his major works &quot;La Danse&quot; specially for Shchukin as part of a two painting commission, the other painting being &quot;Music&quot; (1910). An earlier version of &quot;La Danse&quot; (1909) is in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

==Gertrude Stein, Académie Matisse, and the Cone sisters==

Around April 1906, Matisse met Pablo Picasso, who was 11 years his junior. The two became lifelong friends as well as rivals and are often compared. One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and still lifes, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris salon of Gertrude Stein with her partner Alice B. Toklas. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris—Gertrude Stein, her brothers Leo Stein, Michael Stein, and Michael&#x27;s wife Sarah—were important collectors and supporters of Matisse&#x27;s paintings. In addition, Gertrude Stein&#x27;s two American friends from Baltimore, the Cone sisters Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the Baltimore Museum of Art.
While numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 rue de Fleurus. Where the works of Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso dominated Leo and Gertrude Stein&#x27;s collection, Sarah Stein&#x27;s collection particularly emphasised Matisse.

Contemporaries of Leo and Gertrude Stein, Matisse and Picasso became part of their social circle and routinely joined the gatherings that took place on Saturday evenings at 27 rue de Fleurus. Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking:

More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings—and the Cézannes: Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.

Among Pablo Picasso&#x27;s acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were Fernande Olivier (Picasso&#x27;s mistress), Georges Braque, André Derain, the poets Max Jacob and Guillaume Apollinaire, Marie Laurencin (Apollinaire&#x27;s mistress and an artist in her own right), and Henri Rousseau.

His friends organized and financed the &quot;Académie Matisse&quot; in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists. It operated from 1907 until 1911. The initiative for the academy came from the Steins and the Dômiers, with the involvement of Hans Purrmann, Patrick Henry Bruce, and Sarah Stein.

Matisse spent seven months in Morocco from 1912 to 1913, producing about 24 paintings and numerous drawings. His frequent orientalist topics of later paintings, such as odalisques, can be traced to this period. Goldfish in aquariums also became a frequently recurring theme in Matisse&#x27;s art following his trip to Morocco.

===Selected works: Paris, 1910–1917===
==After Paris==

In 1917, Matisse relocated to Cimiez on the French Riviera, a suburb of the city of Nice. His work of the decade or so following this relocation shows a relaxation and softening of his approach. This &quot;return to order&quot; is characteristic of much post-World War I art, and can be compared with the neoclassicism of Picasso and Stravinsky as well as the return to traditionalism of Derain.
Matisse&#x27;s orientalist odalisque paintings are characteristic of the period; while this work was popular, some contemporary critics found it shallow and decorative.

In the late 1920s, Matisse once again engaged in active collaborations with other artists. He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.

After 1930, a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector Albert C. Barnes convinced Matisse to produce a large mural for the Barnes Foundation, &quot;The Dance II&quot;, which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cut-out technique is also evident in his painting &quot;Large Reclining Nude&quot; (1935). Matisse worked on this painting for several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs, which he sent to Etta Cone.

==World War II years==
Matisse&#x27;s wife Amélie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion, Lydia Delectorskaya, ended their 41-year marriage in July 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them. Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio, and coordinating his business affairs.

Matisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940, but managed to make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to depart for Brazil to escape the occupation of France but changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France. In September 1940, he wrote Pierre: &quot;It seemed to me as if I would be deserting. If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?&quot; Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay.

While the Nazis occupied France from 1940 to 1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on &quot;degenerate art&quot; in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit, along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, although without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their &quot;Aryan&quot; status, including Matisse. He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the Mourlot Studios in Paris.

In 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died. Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.

That same year, a nursing student named Monique Bourgeois responded to an advertisement placed by Matisse for a nurse. A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a Dominican nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor.

Matisse remained, for the most part, isolated in southern France throughout the war, but his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, Pierre held an exhibition in New York, &quot;Artists in Exile&quot;, which was to become legendary. Matisse&#x27;s estranged wife, Amélie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months. Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the Résistance during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany. Marguerite managed to escape from the train to Ravensbrück, which was halted during an Allied air raid; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war until rescued by fellow resisters. Matisse&#x27;s student Rudolf Levy was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944.

==Final years==
===Cut-outs===
Diagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him reliant on a wheelchair and often bed bound. Painting and sculpture became physical challenges, so with the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or decoupage. He cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with gouache by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arranged them to form lively compositions. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity—an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture. His initial pieces were modest in size, but he eventually developed murals and room-sized works. He referred to his final years as his second life, because while his mobility was limited, he could wander through gardens in the form of his cut-outs. 

Although the paper cut-out was Matisse&#x27;s major medium in the final decade of his life, his first recorded use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the &quot;Le chant du rossignol&quot;, an opera composed by Igor Stravinsky. Albert C. Barnes arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.

He moved to the hilltop of Vence, France in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist&#x27;s book titled &quot;Jazz&quot;. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for &quot;Jazz&quot;. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting &quot;An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success…&quot;

The number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following &quot;Jazz&quot;, and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as &quot;Oceania the Sky&quot; and &quot;Oceania the Sea&quot; of 1946. Under Matisse&#x27;s direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room. The two Oceania pieces, his first cut-outs of this scale, evoked a trip to Tahiti he made years before.

In May 1954, his cut out &quot;The Sheaf&quot; was exhibited at the Salon de Mai and met with success. The artwork was a commission for American collectors Sidney and Frances Brody and the cut out was then adapted to a ceramic for their house in Los Angeles. It is now located in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

===Chapel and museum===
In 1948, Matisse began to prepare designs for the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence, which allowed him to expand this technique within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, chasubles, and tabernacle door—all planned using the cut-out method—had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper cut-out as his sole medium for expression up until his death.

This project was the result of the close friendship between Matisse and Bourgeois, now Sister Jacques-Marie, despite him being an atheist. They had met again in Vence and started the collaboration, a story related in her book &quot;Henri Matisse: La Chapelle de Vence&quot; (1992) and in the documentary &quot;A Model for Matisse&quot; (2003).

In 1952, Matisse established a museum dedicated to his work, the Matisse Museum in Le Cateau, and this museum is now the third-largest collection of Matisse works in France.

According to David Rockefeller, Matisse&#x27;s final work was the design for a stained-glass window installed at the Union Church of Pocantico Hills near the Rockefeller estate north of New York City: &quot;It was his final artistic creation; the maquette was on the wall of his bedroom when he died in November of 1954.&quot; Installation was completed in 1956.

==Death==
Matisse died of a heart attack at the age of 84 on 3 November 1954. He is buried in the cemetery of the Monastère Notre Dame de Cimiez, in the Cimiez neighbourhood of Nice.

==Legacy==

The first painting of Matisse acquired by a public collection was &quot;Still Life with Geraniums&quot; (1910), acquired in 1912 by the Pinakothek der Moderne.

Matisse&#x27;s son Pierre Matisse (1900–1989) opened a modern art gallery in New York City during the 1930s. The Pierre Matisse Gallery, which was active from 1931 until 1989, represented and exhibited many European artists and a few Americans and Canadians in New York often for the first time. He exhibited Joan Miró, Marc Chagall, Alberto Giacometti, Jean Dubuffet, André Derain, Yves Tanguy, Le Corbusier, Paul Delvaux, Wifredo Lam, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Balthus, Leonora Carrington, Zao Wou Ki, Sam Francis, and Simon Hantaï, sculptors Theodore Roszak, Raymond Mason, and Reg Butler, and several other important artists, including the work of Henri Matisse.

The Musée Matisse in Nice, a municipal museum, has one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of Matisse&#x27;s works, tracing his artistic beginnings and his evolution through to his last works. The museum, which opened in 1963, is located in the Villa des Arènes, a seventeenth-century villa in the neighbourhood of Cimiez.

A crater on the planet Mercury was named Matisse in his honor in 1976.

Matisse&#x27;s daughter Marguerite often aided Matisse scholars with insights about his working methods and his works. She died in 1982 while compiling a catalogue of her father&#x27;s work.

His &quot;The Plum Blossoms&quot; (1948) was purchased on 8 September 2005 for the Museum of Modern Art by Henry Kravis and the new president of the museum, Marie-Josée Drouin. Its estimated price was $25 million. Previously, it had not been seen by the public since 1970.

In 2025 all of Matisse’s work entered the public domain in the United States.

Henri Matisse&#x27;s grandson Paul Matisse is an artist and inventor living in Massachusetts. Matisse&#x27;s great-granddaughter Sophie Matisse is active as an artist.

== Nazi-looted art ==

Numerous artworks by Matisse were seized by the Nazis or looted from Jewish collectors or changed hands in forced sales during the Nazi years. In the past twenty years, several artworks by Matisse have been restituted to the heirs of their pre-Third Reich owners, including &quot;Le Mur Rose&quot;, from France&#x27;s Pompidou Museum to the heirs of Henry Fuld, &quot;&quot;Femme Assise&quot;,&quot; discovered in the stash of Hildebrand Gurlitt&#x27;s son in Munich, &quot;La vallée de la Stour,&quot; which had belonged to Anna Jaffé, found in the La Chaux-de-Fonds Museum and many others.

The German Lost Art Foundation lists 38 artworks by Matisse in the Lost Art Internet Database.

==Recent exhibitions==
&quot;Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs&quot; was exhibited at London&#x27;s Tate Modern, from April to September 2014. The show was the largest and most extensive of the cut-outs ever mounted, including approximately 100 paper maquettes—borrowed from international public and private collections—as well as a selection of related drawings, prints, illustrated books, stained glass, and textiles. In total, the retrospective featured 130 works encompassing his practice from 1937 to 1954. The Tate Modern show was the first in its history to attract more than half a million people.

The show was then moved to New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, where it was on display from October 12, 2014, until February 10, 2015. The newly conserved cut-out, &quot;The Swimming Pool&quot;, which had not been exhibited for more than 20 years, returned to the galleries as the centerpiece of the exhibition.

In 2018, Matisse&#x27;s work was exhibited alongside that of Joan Miró, Le Corbusier, Raymond Hains and Éric Sandillon at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in Riga, Latvia. This exhibition, titled &quot;&quot;Colour of Gobelins: Contemporary Gobelins from the &#x27;Mobilier national&#x27; collection in France&quot;,&quot; took place during the sixth edition of the Riga Textile Art.

From 1 May to 10 September 2022, the Museum of Modern Art exhibited Matisse&#x27;s painting &quot;The Red Studio&quot;, along with &quot;paintings and drawings closely related to &quot;The Red Studio&quot;&quot;.

<text>Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is the debut studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on June 12, 1985, by Combat Records. At the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. The band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album by themselves, after spending half of the album&#x27;s budget on drugs, alcohol, and food. Despite the poor production, the album was a well-received effort that obtained strong reviews in various music publications. &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; played an essential role in establishing thrash metal as an authentic subgenre of heavy metal music. It explores themes of death, occultism, and violence.

The album features the track &quot;Mechanix&quot;, a song that frontman Dave Mustaine would perform with Metallica during his tenure in the band, and a controversial cover of the 1965 song &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;. A deluxe edition, completely remixed and remastered with several bonus tracks, was released through Loud Records on February 5, 2002. It features vastly different artwork, with its cover based on the version originally designed by Mustaine in 1985. All songs from the album were performed frequently during Megadeth&#x27;s initial tour but have been steadily dropped from the setlist since, except for &quot;Mechanix&quot;. A new remastered version of the album called &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill&quot; was released on June 8, 2018, which includes a version of &quot;These Boots&quot; with re-recorded vocals, redone to match Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s version.

==Background==
Originally, Dave Mustaine was the lead guitarist for Metallica. However, due to drinking, substance abuse, violent behavior, and personality conflicts with bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, Mustaine was eventually fired from the band. Two months after being fired from Metallica, Mustaine met bassist David Ellefson and together they formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later recalled: &quot;After getting fired from Metallica, all I remember is that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them.&quot; Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth&#x27;s music in order to challenge his former band. He sped up existing songs such as &quot;Mechanix&quot;, which Metallica&#x27;s new line-up adapted into the slower paced &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;. Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to &quot;straighten Metallica up&quot;, as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk, and said that he could not play guitar.

After going through multiple vocalists, including Lor Kane, Billy Bonds and John Cyriis, Mustaine decided to handle the vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band&#x27;s primary lyricist, main songwriter, and co-lead and rhythm guitarist. Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape early in 1984 titled &quot;Last Rites&quot;, engineered by Karat Faye, and released it on March 9, 1984. On the strength of the demo, the band was asked to sign with the New York-based independent label Combat Records in November 1984. Early in 1985, Megadeth was given $8,000 ($23,323 in 2024) by Combat to record and produce its debut album. However, this proved not to be enough, and the band was given a further $4,000 ($11,661 in 2024). Instead, a majority of the budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, prompting the group to fire the original producer, and produce the record themselves. Poland has disputed this account. The album was successfully recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California.

==Music and lyrics==
According to writer Peter Buckley, the record presented a faster, &quot;thrashier kind of heavy metal&quot;. Steve Huey of AllMusic opined that the music on &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; is predominantly &quot;chaotic&quot;, accompanied by &quot;lightning-fast&quot; solo sections. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Mike Stagno said that the original pressing greatly suffered from the poor production, which made the record difficult to listen to. However, he noted that the music is performed at rapid speed, with precise riffing by both Poland and Mustaine. In his book &quot;Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal&quot;, editor Jeff Wagner wrote the album displayed unusual rhythms and unorthodox guitar riffs, which carried &quot;like a runaway train&quot;. Speaking about the intensity of the record, Ellefson said that &quot;extreme speed was deemed the cool factor in thrash metal back in those days&quot;. Although Ellefson considers the album as a solid debut release, he wanted some of the songs to be recorded in slower tempo.

The album explores gloomy lyrical subjects such as death, violence, and occultism. Speaking about the themes on the album, author Bob Larson asserted that Megadeth &quot;cranks out songs about spilling blood and stomping guts with venomous anger&quot;. The album&#x27;s title, as well as its lyrics, led to accusations whether the band was promoting Satanism. These allegations were rigidly denied by Mustaine, who said that the band consciously kept away from the Satanic image. &quot;I mean, it&#x27;s great to thrash and pound, cut yourself up, scream and have fun, but you don&#x27;t have to take out a Pagan attitude. Why support the Devil? He&#x27;s already there. I&#x27;d rather just fucking thrash and be a metalist and listen to whatever I want to than be forced to listen to one style of music.&quot;

==Songs==
The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Last Rites/Loved to Death&quot;, consists of two parts. The first part, &quot;Last Rites&quot;, is an instrumental featuring a piano intro, which is a reinterpretation of J.S. Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Mustaine explained that &quot;Loved to Death&quot; was his &quot;version of a love song&quot; to his girlfriend at the time. The title track was inspired by &quot;The Punisher&quot; comic book, and tells of a paid assassin. The song caused minor media controversy when a man posted an online request to a radio station to play the tune, saying it was &quot;good music to go postal and kill a bunch of people to&quot;. The man was later arrested under suspicion of commencing a potential shooting spree. &quot;The Skull Beneath the Skin&quot; was developed under the working title &quot;Self Destruct&quot;. The song graphically describes a horrendous human torture, while also probing into the occult and black magic. Mustaine pointed that the creation of Vic Rattlehead was explained throughout that track. &quot;Rattlehead&quot;, according to Dave Mustaine, was dedicated to the band&#x27;s mascot and their fans.

&quot;Looking Down the Cross&quot; was penned by Mustaine in 1983 under the working title &quot;Speak No Evil&quot;. The song tells about the temptation of Jesus Christ, using religious metaphors and imagery. &quot;Chosen Ones&quot; was partially inspired by Tim the Enchanter from the movie &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;. &quot;Mechanix&quot; was originally written by Mustaine before his tenure in Metallica. He would perform the song with them during his time in the band and, after his departure, the music and lyrics were modified to create &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;. Lyrically, &quot;Mechanix&quot; is about having sex at a gas station. 

The album features the first of many covers performed by Megadeth: a speed metal version of Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s classic &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;, with lyrics altered by Mustaine. This sparked controversy, as in 1995, the song&#x27;s original author, Lee Hazlewood, &quot;took offense&quot; at the rewritten lyrics and requested that the song be removed or else risk getting sued. The song was removed from all pressings released afterwards, and in 2002, the album was re-released with a modified version of the song: the altered lyrics were censored because Hazlewood had not given permission to the band to release the cover in its original version. 

In the liner notes of the album&#x27;s 2002 reissue, Mustaine was &quot;strongly critical of Hazlewood&quot;, noting that Hazlewood received royalties for a number of years before taking issue. In 2018, the song was released with the original Lee Hazlewood lyrics on the remixed and remastered version of &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot;

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s artwork, featuring a plastic skull with &quot;tinfoil and ketchup&quot;, was not intended to be the original artwork. The intended artwork was inspired by the Three wise monkeys; Mustaine drew the original sketch and asked his friend Peyton Tuttle to paint a version of it; this early version was used on Megadeth merchandise. Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat Records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included it on their list of &quot;50 most hilariously ugly rock and metal album covers ever&quot;.

==Promotional tour==
Megadeth began with live performances before the record was released. Although not a member of the band, Kerry King of Slayer played guitar for a short period because Mustaine had not recruited a full-time guitarist yet. In mid-1985, the group started a tour promoting the &quot;Killing Is My Business...&quot; album with the band Exciter. During the tour, guitarist Chris Poland abruptly left the band, and was replaced by guitarist Mike Albert. However, Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, and stayed with the band up after the tour of the next album.

==Release==
The album was released on June 12, 1985. To date it remains the only Megadeth album that did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, primarily because it was released through an independent label with little promotion. Nevertheless, the album still went on to become one of Combat Records&#x27; highest selling releases. Later that year, Capitol Records signed Megadeth as they began working on their second album, &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;, released the following year. 

A limited edition of &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; was released in 2002. This version&#x27;s cover is redesigned to match Mustaine&#x27;s original sketch, and the song &quot;These Boots&quot; was re-added, with extra &quot;bleeps&quot; in place of the rewritten sections. Over 254,000 copies of the album were sold in the United States since the beginning of the Nielsen SoundScan era. 

==2018 remaster==
In April 2018 it was announced that the album would once again be remixed and remastered, with Mark Lewis remixing the album and Ted Jensen remastering it. Titled &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill&quot;, the deluxe reissue features new album artwork, new mixes and masters of the original album, a new version of &quot;These Boots&quot; featuring Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s original lyrics, the original 1984 demos featured on the 2002 remix, and newly-discovered live tracks sourced from VHS tapes found in Dave Mustaine&#x27;s attic, as well as a previously undiscovered &quot;performance&quot; by Samuelson. The new remaster was released on June 8, 2018.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; received mostly positive reviews, not just from metal-oriented magazines, but from the mainstream press too. Colin Larkin, writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, called the album a &quot;ferocious blast of high-energy thrash metal&quot;, weakened by a thin production. Similarly, Steve Huey from AllMusic observed that the album is &quot;as raw as Megadeth gets&quot;. However, Huey noted that the riffs and compositions weren&#x27;t completely developed, and called Mustaine&#x27;s vocals &quot;amateurish at best&quot;. Chad Bowar from About.com said that Megadeth were still &quot;finding their way&quot; on their debut album, but remarked that the band showed great potential through angry and passionate musicianship.

Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; dismissed the original recording, but praised the re-release, writing that the album &quot;blazes on at a furious pace&quot;. According to him, the record greatly influenced the heavy metal genre in the upcoming two decades. Sputnikmusic staff member Mike Stagno agreed with the praise for the remaster, saying that the &quot;fuzzy&quot; sound of the original release was replaced with a clearer production. Even so, he opined that the album still retained the &quot;thrashy&quot; sound characteristic for the band during this period. Mike Marsh of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; recommended the music &quot;for people who want it loud, fast and brutal&quot;. In a retrospective review for KNAC, Frank Meyer said that the album put Megadeth at the forefront of heavy metal scene in the early 1980s and credited it for paving the way for thrash metal&#x27;s arrival. &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; praised Mustaine&#x27;s &quot;masterful&quot; wordplay and called the record a representative of &quot;the golden age of speed metal&quot;.

<text>Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying? is the second studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on September 25, 1986, through Capitol Records. The project was originally handled by Combat Records, resulting in the original mix of the album being co-produced by Randy Burns. Capitol Records then bought the rights to the album and hired another producer named Paul Lani to mix it himself. The recording of the album was difficult for the band, because of the ongoing drug issues the members had at the time. Drummer Gar Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland were fired shortly after the album&#x27;s promotional tour for drug abuse, making &quot;Peace Sells&quot; Samuelson&#x27;s last Megadeth album. Poland reappeared as a session musician on Megadeth&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;. The title track, noted for its politically conscious lyrics, was released as the album&#x27;s second single and was the band&#x27;s first music video. The album&#x27;s cover art, featuring the band&#x27;s mascot Vic Rattlehead in front of a desolated United Nations Headquarters, was created by Ed Repka.

&quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; is often regarded as a thrash metal classic and as an album that gave prominence to extreme metal. It has been featured in several publications&#x27; best album lists, including Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; and Martin Popoff&#x27;s &quot;Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The album has been reissued several times over the years. In 2004, the album was remixed and remastered by Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine, with extensive liner notes detailing the album&#x27;s background. In 2011, the three different versions were reissued as part of the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebration. All of them, with the exception of the 2004 mixes, feature new remastering.

==Background and recording==
In an interview for &quot;Metal Forces&quot; in December 1985, frontman Dave Mustaine revealed that the band had already started writing new material for the second album. He said that two songs (&quot;Black Friday&quot; and &quot;Bad Omen&quot;) were finished and described them as a &quot;total blur&quot;, being much faster than &quot;Rattlehead&quot; from their debut album, &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; Speaking about the lyrical content of &quot;Peace Sells...&quot;, Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson stated that they wanted to change the public perception of heavy metal by writing songs that contained socially aware lyrics. Mustaine further noted that the band was not unaware of the political situation at the time, and that some of his political beliefs were reflected in the songs. Professional rock critic Steve Huey noted the album&#x27;s combination of &quot;punkish political awareness with a dark, threatening, typically heavy metal worldview&quot;.

During the first two months of 1986, Megadeth commenced a brief tour of the East Coast of the United States. At the shows, which were practically a continuation of the Killing for a Living tour, the band performed a number of songs from its upcoming album. Following the conclusion of the tour, the band intended to start making the record at the Music Grinder studio on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. Mustaine lifted the title from an article in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, which was titled &quot;Peace Would Sell But No One Would Buy It&quot;. Their label at the time, Combat Records, provided a recording budget of $25,000 ($71,553 in 2024), which allowed the band to hire a freelance producer, Randy Burns. The recording of the album turned out to be very difficult for the band, because Mustaine and Ellefson were both homeless at the time. Furthermore, guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson would not show up for hours because of their heroin addiction. Shortly after the band finished the final recordings of the album for Combat, they were approached by Tim Carr, an A&amp;R representative of Capitol Records. After securing a contract with the group, Capitol hired producer Paul Lani to remix the original mixes done by Randy Burns, the previous producer.

Poland was the only member who had multiple instruments, as Ellefson and Mustaine only had one bass and guitar respectively. Unlike Mustaine&#x27;s previous band, both he and Poland laid down lead and rhythm tracks.

==Songs==
===Tracks 1–4===
&quot;Wake Up Dead&quot; features lyrics which describe a man who has been cheating on his wife or girlfriend and is sneaking into his house, knowing that if his wife finds out about his other lover, she will kill him. Mustaine said that &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot; was written about him cheating on a girl with whom he was living. He stayed with her because he was homeless at the time and needed a place to stay. Unfortunately, he was in love with another girl and thought the one he lived with would be mad because he was cheating on her. He had to leave her because he thought she had intentions to kill him. &quot;The Conjuring&quot;, according to evangelist Bob Larson, simulates a Satanic ceremony, and makes references about being the devil&#x27;s advocate and his salesman. Mustaine explained the song is about black magic and contains instructions for hexes. However, because the subject matter appears incompatible to his conversion to Christianity, the song had not been played live since 2001, until June 12, 2018, when Megadeth performed &quot;The Conjuring&quot; live for the first time in 17 years at the Home Monitoring Aréna in Plzeň, Czech Republic.

&quot;Peace Sells&quot; reflects Mustaine&#x27;s political and social beliefs. The lyrics are a disapproval of the American way and convey Mustaine&#x27;s wish for a new social structure. Ellefson has stated that during the tour prior to recording the album, the band could tell then that the song was going to be a hit. The video for the title track became an MTV mainstay and the opening bass line was used as introduction to MTV News. However, Mustaine proclaimed that they received no royalties because the song was excluded shortly before MTV would have to pay them for its use. &quot;Devils Island&quot; is a reference to a former French penal colony off the coast of French Guiana. The lyrics detail the thoughts of a condemned prisoner awaiting execution. He is spared by God, but must spend the rest of his life on the island.

===Tracks 5–8===
&quot;Good Mourning/Black Friday&quot; is a two-piece song, which begins with an instrumental section called &quot;Good Mourning&quot;. Lyrically, Mustaine has described &quot;Black Friday&quot; as being about &quot;a homicidal madman who goes on a killing spree&quot;. With an excessive use of gory language and violent imagery, the song chronicles the acts of a serial killer. It was inspired by Dijon Carruthers, who was briefly the band&#x27;s drummer prior to the hiring of Gar Samuelson. According to Mustaine, Carruthers was hanging out with people who were practicing occultism, and they inspired him to write songs based on spiritual themes.

&quot;Bad Omen&quot; explores the theme of occultism. Mustaine described &quot;Bad Omen&quot; like &quot;two happy campers who have stumbled onto a Satanic orgy in the middle of the woods&quot; and then &quot;they see these fools waiting around for Satan&#x27;s blessing&quot;. Asked whether the band members really believe in the subject matters they write, Mustaine responded: &quot;We&#x27;re aware of the subjects we write about—witchcraft, Satanic sacrifices and the like—but we&#x27;re not condoning them.&quot; &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Superstitious&quot; was written by Willie Dixon and originally recorded by Howlin&#x27; Wolf in 1961. However, Megadeth&#x27;s version is vastly different from the original. &quot;My Last Words&quot; is about a game of Russian roulette and the fear one goes through when playing the game. Despite being one of the lesser known tracks on the record, music journalist Martin Popoff said that the song was an example of the band&#x27;s &quot;fast thrashers&quot; and an evidence why Megadeth were dubbed as the &quot;fearless speed progenitors&quot;. Lars Ulrich, founding member of Metallica and former bandmate of Mustaine, has stated that &quot;My Last Words&quot; is his favorite Megadeth song.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; was released on September 25, 1986. The album&#x27;s artwork was designed by Ed Repka, who later did other artwork for the band. The cover art depicts the band&#x27;s mascot, Vic Rattlehead, in front of a ruined United Nations Headquarters. He is portrayed as a real estate agent, who is selling the devastated remains of the organization&#x27;s headquarters. Repka considers the art cover to be a &quot;significant milestone&quot; in his career.

The title track was released as a single, for which the band filmed its first video. In 1987, a video was made for the lead single, &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot;, which featured the band performing in a steel cage. Soon after the album&#x27;s release, Megadeth began a tour as a supporting band for Motörhead. The tour took place in California and the southwestern parts of the United States. However, due to disagreements between the managements of the two bands, Megadeth were pulled from the last three shows. Following the short stint with Motörhead, Megadeth were added as the opening act on Alice Cooper&#x27;s Constrictor tour, which took place at the beginning of 1987. Later in 1987, after the conclusion of the album&#x27;s promotional tour, Mustaine fired Poland and Samuelson due to their substance abuse issues.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; was well received by contemporary music critics. &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s critic Fred Goodman facetiously remarked that the album is an &quot;array of impressive tracks&quot; that he does not recommend for &quot;the weak-hearted&quot;. Colin Larkin, writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, viewed the album as a vast improvement over their previous record, from both technical and musical aspect. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; deemed &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; as the album that saw the inception of Megadeth&#x27;s always-distinctive sound. Writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, author Nathan Brackett said that Megadeth were representing &quot;the dark and nasty side&quot; of American thrash throughout the 1980s. However, he considered the album to be almost identical to the rest of their discography from this period.

===Legacy===
In retrospect, &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; has been regarded as a milestone of the American thrash metal movement. Along with Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, which were also released in 1986, &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; is considered pivotal in giving prominence to extreme metal. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey recognized the record as a notable achievement in the band&#x27;s history, and called it a &quot;classic of early thrash&quot;. Similarly, Chad Bowar of About.com said that the album captured Megadeth in their prime, and recommended it as a &quot;mandatory&quot; recording for the fans of this genre. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Mike Stagno named the album a &quot;bona-fide masterpiece&quot; and said it was the main reason why Megadeth became one of the leading acts of the underground scene. Joel McIver, writing in &quot;Record Collector&quot;, said that the album&#x27;s main strength was its fluidity, with all songs moving in a continuous, steady stream. According to him, the album was &quot;flip the bird&quot; to the critics who were hostile to this type of music at the time.

&quot;Pitchfork Media&quot;&#x27;s Jess Harvell said that thanks to this album, Megadeth developed a strong cult following. He viewed the record as a resistance against the glam metal acts from the day, because bands like Megadeth were more appealing to the &quot;dead-end kids&quot;. Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised the album for making strong impression both musically and visually. Although Begrand acknowledged that this was not Megadeth&#x27;s most technically proficient album, he explained that the unique combination of &quot;the extreme and the accessible&quot; is why this album remained a fan-favorite. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Mike Powell cited the record as an example of &quot;glossy hardcore&quot; with Satanic lyricism. Jeff Treppel from &quot;Decibel&quot; noted that the album exhibits a distinctive sound, which set Megadeth apart from their contemporaries: &quot;&quot;Peace Sells&quot; was a leaner, nastier predator. Megadeth preferred to kill with speed and precision instead of size and power.&quot; According to him, the album influenced countless heavy metal bands that followed, from Arch Enemy to DragonForce.

In addition to being critically acclaimed, the album received numerous accolades since its release. It has been featured in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, as well as in Martin Popoff&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. About.com ranked it third on their list of &quot;Essential Thrash Metal Albums&quot;, commenting that more than two decades after its release, the record holds a status as an undisputed classic. In 2017, it was ranked 8th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Reissues==
In 2003, Capitol Records re-released the album on DVD-Audio, with the original track list, in 96k/24-bit resolution for both surround and stereo mixes, and music videos for &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot; and &quot;Peace Sells&quot;. The album was remixed and remastered in 2004 along with the rest of the band&#x27;s Capitol Records albums. This reissue featured four alternate mixes of the album&#x27;s songs as bonus tracks.

On July 12, 2011, the band re-released the album in both a two-disc reissue and a special five-disc + three-LP box set, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the album. The reissue features liner notes written by Mustaine and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. The 25th anniversary re-release sold approximately 2,000 units in its first week of release.

The 25th Anniversary edition box set features five discs. Discs one–three all feature the original album, with disc one having the original mix (remastered version from 2011), disc two featuring the 2004 remix, and disc three featuring the Randy Burns mixes (four examples of which appear as bonus tracks on the album&#x27;s 2004 release). Disc four features the same 1987 show available on the two disc set. Disc five contains both the original album (again, remastered version from 2011), and the above listed 1987 show in hi-resolution audio. The 25th anniversary two CD edition features the original album on disc one and a previously unreleased 1987 concert on disc two.
