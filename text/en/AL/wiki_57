<text>Howard is an English-language given name originating from Old French Huard (or Houard) from a Germanic source similar to Old High German &quot;*Hugihard&quot; &quot;heart-brave&quot;, or &quot;*Hoh-ward&quot;, literally &quot;high defender; chief guardian&quot;. It is also probably in some cases a confusion with the Old Norse cognate &quot;Haward&quot; (&quot;Hávarðr&quot;), which means &quot;high guard&quot;, and as a surname also with the unrelated Hayward. In some rare cases it is from the Old English &quot;eowu hierde&quot; &quot;ewe herd&quot;. In Anglo-Norman the French digram &quot;-ou-&quot; was often rendered as &quot;-ow-&quot; such as &quot;tour&quot; → &quot;tower&quot;, &quot;flour&quot; (western variant form of &quot;fleur&quot;) → &quot;flower&quot;, etc. (with svarabakhti). A diminutive is &quot;Howie&quot; and its shortened form is &quot;Ward&quot; (most common in the 19th century). Between 1900 and 1960, Howard has ranked in the U.S. Top 200; between 1960 and 1990, it ranked in the U.S. Top 400; between 1990 and 2004, it ranked in the U.S. Top 600.

<doc id="61814" wikidata="Q379687" url="?curid=61814" title="List of Bulgarian monarchs">
<text>The monarchs of Bulgaria ruled Bulgaria during the medieval First ( 681–1018) and Second (1185–1422) Bulgarian empires, as well as during the modern Principality (1879–1908) and Kingdom (1908–1946) of Bulgaria. This list includes monarchs from the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire until modern times, omitting earlier mythical rulers as well as rulers of separate states such as Old Great Bulgaria and Volga Bulgaria.

Various titles have been used by the rulers of Bulgaria. The only recorded title, used before Bulgaria&#x27;s conversion to Christianity, is &quot;kanasubigi&quot;, likely meaning &quot;Khan, Lord of the Army&quot; or &quot;the sublime Khan&quot;. When Bulgaria converted to Christianity in the ninth century, the ruler Boris I (852–889) was using the title &quot;knyaz&quot; (prince). For much of its later history under the first and second empires, Bulgaria functioned as a multi-ethnic imperial state modelled on the neighbouring Byzantine Empire, which contributed to the adoption of the title of &quot;tsar&quot; (emperor) by Bulgarian monarchs beginning with Simeon I (893–927) in 913. Some powerful medieval Bulgarian rulers challenged Byzantine authority by proclaiming themselves as both Bulgarian and Roman emperors.

When Bulgaria re-emerged as a state in 1878 in the form of the Principality of Bulgaria, the rulers initially used the title &quot;knyaz&quot; since they were autonomous vassals of the Ottoman Empire and not fully independent. From Bulgaria&#x27;s complete independence from the Ottomans in 1908 until the abolition of the monarchy in 1946, Bulgarian monarchs once more used the title &quot;tsar&quot;, though this time generally translated internationally as &quot;king&quot; rather than &quot;emperor&quot;.

== Titles ==

=== Titles in the First Bulgarian Empire (681–1018) ===

Evidence concerning the titles used by the rulers of the First Bulgarian Empire (681–1018) prior to the conversion to Christianity in the 860s is scant. The only title known from contemporary sources is &quot;kanasubigi&quot;, recorded in ten Greek-language inscriptions (as ΚΑΝΑΣΥΒΙΓΙ) from the ninth century in reference to Omurtag (814–831) and his son Malamir (831–836). Two gold medallions struck for Omurtag also use the same title. 

Upon his conversion to Christianity in 864/865, Boris I (852–889) adopted the new ruling title &quot;knyaz&quot;, generally translated as &quot;prince&quot; (though sometimes alternatively as &quot;king&quot;). This title was used by the Bulgarian rulers until 913, when the &quot;knyaz&quot; Simeon I (893–927), Boris I&#x27;s son, invaded the Byzantine Empire. Simeon aspired to make Bulgaria into the new &quot;universal monarchy&quot; (a role the Byzantines viewed themselves as having) by absorbing and replacing the empire centered in Constantinople. Due to the threat presented by Simeon, who reached the walls of Constantinople, the Byzantines relented and the Patriarch of Constantinople, Nicholas Mystikos, granted him an imperial crown. The only other monarch recognized as a &quot;basileus&quot; (i.e. emperor) by the Byzantines was (at times) the Holy Roman emperor. The Byzantines did not consider Simeon as outranking their own emperors and designated him as the &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians&quot;. Simeon himself used the grander title &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans&quot;. The title of emperor was in Bulgarian translated as &quot;tsar&quot; (deriving from the Latin &quot;caesar&quot;), seen as equivalent to the Greek &quot;basileus&quot; or Latin &quot;imperator&quot;.

Bulgarian rulers from the death of Simeon I in 927 until the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018 used the simpler &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians&quot;, ceasing to claim Byzantium&#x27;s universal monarchy.

=== Titles in the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1422) ===

The first rulers of the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1422) revived the style used by Simeon I&#x27;s successors, &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians&quot;, rendered &quot;tsr’ Bl’garom&quot; in Bulgarian documents and &quot;imperator Bulgarorum&quot; in Latin. The second empire&#x27;s third ruler, Kaloyan (1196–1207), adopted the grander title &quot;Emperor of Bulgarians and Vlachs&quot; (&quot;imperator Bulgarorum et Blachorum&quot;). He unsuccessfully sought recognition of this title from the Papacy, though Pope Innocent III merely recognized him as &quot;King of the Bulgarians and Vlachs&quot; (&quot;rex Bulgarorum et Blachorum&quot;), not wishing to recognize any other emperor than the Holy Roman emperor.

The fifth ruler of the second empire, Ivan Asen II (1218–1241) after 1230 extended his original title &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians&quot; to the grander &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians and Greeks&quot; (&quot;tsr’ Bl’garom i Gr’kom&quot;, Latin: &quot;imperator Bulgarorum et Grecorum&quot;). This title was taken to reflect his extensive conquests in formerly Byzantine territory and was effectively a revival of Simeon I&#x27;s title since both &quot;Greeks&quot; and &quot;Romans&quot; were envisioned as referring to the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire. Ivan Asen II also introduced the element &quot;autocrat&quot; (Bulgarian: &quot;samodrzac&quot;, Latin: &quot;moderator&quot;) into the Bulgarian imperial title, modelled on its usage in the Byzantine imperial title, and eventually in full styled himself as the &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the Bulgarians and Greeks&quot; (Bulgarian: &quot;tsr’ i samodrzac Bl’garom i Gr’kom&quot;, Latin: &quot;imperator et moderator Bulgarorum et Grecorum&quot;).

Ivan Asen II&#x27;s successors kept &quot;autocrat&quot; in the title but returned to the simpler style &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the Bulgarians&quot;. His extended title was later revived by Ivan Alexander (1331–1371), who also proclaimed himself as the &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the Bulgarians and Greeks&quot; to challenge the authority of the then weakened Byzantine Empire. Ivan Alexander&#x27;s son Ivan Shishman (1371–1395) is also recorded to have used this extended imperial title.

=== Titles in modern Bulgaria (1878–1946) ===
The Tarnovo Constitution of the modern Principality of Bulgaria (1878–1908) stipulated that the monarch was to use the title &quot;&quot;Knyaz&quot; of Bulgaria&quot; (i.e. &quot;Prince of Bulgaria&quot;) rather than &quot;tsar&quot; due to the principality being an autonomous vassal state of the Ottoman Empire rather than a fully independent country.

When Bulgaria achieved complete independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1908, the former &quot;knyaz&quot; Ferdinand I (1887–1918) adopted the higher title of &quot;&quot;Tsar&quot; of the Bulgarians&quot;, as had been used by Bulgarian monarchs in the Middle Ages. The assumption of the title of &quot;tsar&quot; was met with opposition from both the Ottomans and the Russian Empire. Although &quot;tsar&quot; had been understood as equivalent to emperor in medieval times, the title of the new Bulgarian &quot;tsars&quot; was generally translated as &quot;King of the Bulgarians&quot; internationally.

== Names and regnal numbers ==
Regnal numbers for monarchs have only been officially used in Bulgaria in modern times, beginning with Alexander I in 1879. Modern historiography retroactively also assigns sequential regnal numbers to medieval Bulgarian rulers, even if they ruled different Bulgarian states and used different titles; Boris I (852–889) ruled the First Bulgarian Empire as a prince (&quot;knyaz&quot;), his great-grandson Boris II (967–977) ruled the same state as emperor, and Boris III (1918–1943) ruled the modern Kingdom of Bulgaria as &quot;tsar&quot; (king).

There were three different types of names used by medieval Bulgarian monarchs after Bulgaria converted to Christianity; names drawn from Bulgar or Slavic tradition (i.e. Boris, Boril, Vladimir, Presian), names drawn from Christian tradition (i.e. Michael, Simeon, Peter, Ivan, Samuel), or double names combining both (i.e. Ivan Vladislav, Gavril Radomir, Ivan Sratsimir, Theodore Svetoslav). When using a double name, the Christian name always preceded the name drawn from local tradition. Very rarely, Bulgarian rulers used double names combining two Christian names (i.e. Ivan Stephen, Ivan Alexander).

The use of double names by Bulgarian monarchs, sometimes not used consistently in contemporary sources, has in cases led to confusion and misunderstanding in modern efforts to assign regnal numbers. In particular, it has sometimes erroneously been assumed that the usage of double names indicated that the monarchs employed family names; this interpretation has in the past resulted in the use of names such as Ivan II Asen (for Ivan Asen II), George I Terter (for George Terter I) and Michael III Shishman (for Michael Asen III). Names of clans were prominently used in Bulgaria in pre-Christian times, though disappeared from usage sometime after the conversion to Christianity, despite family names being used in some of Bulgaria&#x27;s closest neighbours (such as the Byzantine Empire). Although names such as &quot;Asen&quot; or &quot;Terter&quot; could serve as genealogical and political markers to demonstrate a ruler&#x27;s position in an illustrious lineage they were also fully part of the ruler&#x27;s regnal names, as demonstrated by those rulers whose double names excluded genealogical connections (such as Ivan Alexander). Double names with genealogical connotations were at times also claimed by rulers not belonging to the same dynastic lineage, such as Mitso Asen (1256–1257; who married into the Asen dynasty). 

== First Bulgarian Empire (c. 680–1018) ==
=== Early Bulgarian rulers (c. 680–803) ===
The First Bulgarian Empire is regarded to have been established 680 when the Bulgarian ruler Asparuh crossed the Danube. Asparuh&#x27;s family, the Dulo clan, claimed descent from the Hunnic ruler Attila, through Attila&#x27;s son Ernak. References to political developments within Bulgaria prior to the reign of Krum (c. 803–814) are extremely scant, making the dates and family relationships of the rulers recorded in contemporary and later sources highly uncertain. The rulers below may all belong to the Dulo clan or might alternatively have belonged to various competing clans. Several alternate chronologies of early Bulgarian rulers have been proposed, with some presented below, with the names standardized across sources:
=== House of Krum (803–997) ===


=== House of Cometopuli (997–1018) ===


== Pretenders during Byzantine rule (1018–1185) ==
Various Byzantine military governors (with the title &quot;strategos&quot;) were appointed in formerly Bulgarian lands over the course of the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria, from the 970s onwards. Following the completion of the conquest of Bulgaria in 1018, Emperor Basil II organized much of the central Balkans into the Theme of Bulgaria, which was governed by an imperially appointed official titled (depending on the time) as the &quot;doux&quot; (duke) or &quot;katepano&quot; of Bulgaria. The capital of Byzantine Bulgaria was Skopion (modern-day Skopje). There were several attempts at restoring the Bulgarian Empire during the nearly two centuries of Byzantine rule.
== Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1422) ==
=== House of Asen (1185–1256) ===


=== Successors of the Asenids (1256–1280) ===
The end of the male line of the House of Asen plunged Bulgaria into a chaotic period of fragmentation and civil wars between numerous lines of claimants.

=== House of Terter (1280–1292, first time) ===

=== House of Smilets (1292–1299) ===

=== House of Borjigin (1299–1300) ===

=== House of Terter (1300–1323, second time) ===

=== House of Shishman (1323–1331) ===

=== House of Sratsimir (1331–1422) ===
The rulers of the House of Sratsimir, patrilineal descendants of the despot Sratsimir, are in lists of monarchs often designated as part of the Shishmanid dynasty, with which they only share matrilineal descent. Through their matrilineal descent from the House of Shishman, the rulers of the House of Sratsimir were also descendants of the House of Asen.

== Pretenders during Ottoman rule (1422–1878) ==
Following the gradual conquest of Bulgaria in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Ottomans incorporated the Bulgarian lands into the vast province of Rumelia. In the late 16th century, the new province of Silistra was created due to persistent northern attacks from the Cossacks. Later on, much of modern-day northern Bulgaria was organized into the Danube vilayet, which in terms of borders closely corresponded to the succeeding autonomous Principality of Bulgaria. Like under the period of Byzantine rule, the Ottoman authorities were sometimes faced with Bulgarian uprisings aimed at independence, at times also involving the proclamation of new Bulgarian monarchs.
== Principality (1878–1908) and Kingdom of Bulgaria (1908–1946) ==
=== House of Battenberg (1879–1886) ===

=== House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1887–1946) ===

<doc id="61820" wikidata="Q1659739" url="?curid=61820" title="Alistair MacLeod">
<text>Alistair MacLeod, (July 20, 1936 – April 20, 2014) was a Canadian novelist, short story writer and academic. His powerful and moving stories vividly evoke the beauty of Cape Breton Island&#x27;s rugged landscape and the resilient character of many of its inhabitants, the descendants of Scottish immigrants, who are haunted by ancestral memories and who struggle to reconcile the past and the present. MacLeod has been praised for his verbal precision, his lyric intensity and his use of simple, direct language that seems rooted in an oral tradition.

Although he is known as a master of the short story, MacLeod&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; was voted Atlantic Canada&#x27;s greatest book of all time. The novel also won several literary prizes including the 2001 International Dublin Literary Award.

In 2000, MacLeod&#x27;s two books of short stories, &quot;The Lost Salt Gift of Blood&quot; (1976) and &quot;As Birds Bring Forth the Sun and Other Stories&quot; (1986), were re-published in the volume &quot;Island: The Collected Stories&quot;. MacLeod compared his fiction writing to playing an accordion. &quot;When I pull it out like this,&quot; he explained, &quot;it becomes a novel, and when I compress it like this, it becomes this intense short story.&quot;

MacLeod taught English and creative writing for more than three decades at the University of Windsor, but returned every summer to the Cape Breton cabin on the MacLeod homestead where he did much of his writing. In the introduction to a book of essays on his work, editor Irene Guilford concluded: &quot;Alistair MacLeod&#x27;s birthplace is Canadian, his emotional heartland is Cape Breton, his heritage Scottish, but his writing is of the world.&quot;

==Early life and education==
MacLeod&#x27;s Scottish ancestors emigrated to Cumberland County, Nova Scotia from the Isle of Eigg in the 1790s. They settled at Cape d&#x27;Or on the Bay of Fundy where they appear to have leased farmland. In 1808, the parents with their seven daughters and two sons walked from Cape d&#x27;Or to Inverness County, Cape Breton, a distance of 362 kilometres, after hearing they could farm their own land there. An account of the journey, written by MacLeod himself, says the family took their possessions with them, six cows and a horse. He adds there were few roads at the time, so his great-great-great-grandparents followed the shoreline.

MacLeod was born in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. His parents, whose first language was Canadian Gaelic, had migrated to Saskatchewan from Cape Breton to homestead during the Great Depression. The family moved on to Edmonton when MacLeod was five and then to the town of Mercoal, Alberta where his father worked as a coal miner. However, the MacLeods suffered from homesickness and when Alistair was 10, they returned to Cape Breton and the farmhouse in Dunvegan, Inverness County, that his great-grandfather had built in the 1860s.

MacLeod enjoyed attending school and apparently did well there. He told a CBC Radio interviewer that as a student, he liked to read and write adding, &quot;I was the kind of person who won the English prize in grade twelve.&quot; After graduating from high school in 1954, MacLeod moved to Edmonton where he delivered milk for a year from a horse-drawn wagon.

In 1956, MacLeod furthered his education by attending the Nova Scotia Teachers College in Truro and then taught school for a year on Port Hood Island off Cape Breton&#x27;s west coast. To finance his university education, he worked summers drilling and blasting in mines in British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and, in the uranium mines of northern Ontario. At some point, he also worked at a logging camp on Vancouver Island rising rapidly through the ranks because he was physically able to climb the tallest trees and rig cables to their tops.

Between 1957 and 1960, MacLeod studied at St. Francis Xavier University earning a BA and B.Ed. He then went on to receive his MA in 1961 from the University of New Brunswick. He decided to study for a PhD at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana because Frank O&#x27;Malley taught creative writing there. MacLeod said he was used to analyzing the work of other authors, but wanted to start writing himself. That wouldn&#x27;t have happened, he added, if he had not attended such a &quot;creative, imaginative university.&quot;

He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the English novelist Thomas Hardy whom he admired. &quot;I especially liked the idea,&quot; he told an interviewer years later, &quot;that his novels were usually about people who lived outdoors and were greatly affected by the forces of nature.&quot; MacLeod was awarded his PhD in 1968, the same year he published &quot;The Boat&quot; in &quot;The Massachusetts Review&quot;. The story appeared in the 1969 edition of &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; along with ones by Andre Dubus, Bernard Malamud, Joyce Carol Oates and Isaac Bashevis Singer.

==Academic career==
A specialist in British literature of the 19th century, MacLeod taught English for three years at Indiana University before accepting a post in 1969 at the University of Windsor where he taught English and creative writing for more than three decades. A story published after his death in the student newspaper called him &quot;a dedicated professor, an approachable colleague, and an inspiration to young, local writers.&quot; It quoted Marty Gervais, one of his university colleagues, as saying that the door to MacLeod&#x27;s cluttered office was always open to students, faculty and even members of the public. &quot;It didn&#x27;t matter whether you were a good writer or a bad writer; he was open to talking with you, he would read your work, he would be honest with you, and he would be encouraging as well,&quot; Gervais added. &quot;He could talk your ear off with stories...but he was also a good listener.&quot;

Alan Cumyn, who studied creative writing at the University of Windsor, remembered MacLeod as a teacher who placed great emphasis on the fundamentals of good writing such as language and metaphor, character and conflict, narrative structure and form. He wrote that MacLeod read student work carefully and always began his critiques by pointing to the best things about a story before turning to its weaknesses. &quot;By the end,&quot; Cumyn wrote, &quot;a story might seem in tatters, but in the oddly inspiring way that gifted teachers and editors have, issues and directions were made much clearer, and many of us felt more confident and enthusiastic about our work than we had going in.&quot;

Another student, who attended an intensive writing workshop in Toronto, wrote that if something bothered MacLeod about a student story, he would simply say, &quot;I have a question about that, but not a big one.&quot; If he noticed a glaring inconsistency, MacLeod would say, &quot;Some words and phrases startle me.&quot; When a student asked how long a good short story should be, &quot;MacLeod clasped his hands and looked up toward the ceiling as if in prayer, then responded in a lyrical Cape Breton accent. &#x27;Well then. Well then. Just make your story as long as a piece of string, and it will work out just fine.&#x27;&quot;

MacLeod found that his university duties left little time for creative writing. &quot;One time correcting all my papers and putting circles around &quot;their&quot; and &quot;there&quot; and &quot;they&#x27;re&quot;,&quot; he told a radio interviewer, &quot;I began to think that maybe this wasn&#x27;t the most worthwhile thing I should be doing with my life and so I said...I&#x27;m going to try to write like imaginatively or creatively for two hours a day.&quot; The experiment failed, however, because MacLeod found that by the end of each day, he was too worn out from his academic work to produce stories that were any good. So, he did most of his writing during the summer breaks when his family lived on the MacLeod homestead at Dunvegan, Cape Breton. He would spend mornings there &quot;writing in a cliff-top cabin looking west towards Prince Edward Island.&quot;

==Published works and methods==
MacLeod published only one novel and fewer than 20 short stories during his lifetime. Writing in longhand, he worked slowly refining his sentences until he found what he felt were just the right words. &quot;I write a single sentence at a time,&quot; he once told an interviewer, &quot;and then I read it aloud.&quot;
 
Fellow Cape Breton writer Frank Macdonald described MacLeod as a perfectionist. &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t set a story free,&quot; Macdonald said, &quot;until he was convinced that it was ready.&quot; He added that MacLeod never rewrote a story. &quot;He wrote a sentence, and then waited, then wrote another sentence.&quot; During a CBC Radio interview in 2011, MacLeod spoke about how he shaped his work. He explained that halfway through a story, he would write the final sentence. &quot;I think of that as the last thing I&#x27;m going to say to the reader,&quot; he said. &quot;I write it down and it serves as a lighthouse on the rest of my journey through the story.&quot;

MacLeod&#x27;s published works include the 1976 short story collection &quot;The Lost Salt Gift of Blood&quot; and the 1986 &quot;As Birds Bring Forth the Sun and Other Stories&quot;. The 14 stories in these two volumes appear in &quot;Island: The Collected Short Stories of Alistair MacLeod&quot;. The book, which also contains two new stories, was released in 2000 the year after the publication of his successful first novel &quot;No Great Mischief&quot;. When asked why, as a master short story writer, he had suddenly turned to the novel, MacLeod smiled and replied: &quot;Well, nothing I do is very sudden. I think I just wanted more space. I needed a bus rather than a Volkswagen to put my people in.&quot;

In 2004 MacLeod published an illustrated edition of his story, &quot;To Everything There Is a Season&quot; with the new heading of: &quot;A Cape Breton Christmas Story&quot;.

In October 2012, &quot;Remembrance&quot;, a story commissioned by the Vancouver Writers Fest to mark its 25 anniversary, was published and sold there as a chapbook.

MacLeod&#x27;s books have been translated into 17 languages.

==Critical reaction==

===Short stories===
MacLeod&#x27;s short stories have generated much critical acclaim, especially from Canadian reviewers. In her review of &quot;Island&quot;, for example, Frances Itani calls the book of collected stories about miners, fishermen and Scottish Highlanders who came to Cape Breton &quot;simply stunning.&quot; She also praises the stories for their emotional impact. &quot;Whether you are reading his stories for the first or for the eighth time, they will make you wonder and they will make you weep. The quality of the writing matches the very best in the world.&quot; Itani describes &quot;The Boat&quot;, MacLeod&#x27;s first published story (1968) as possibly the most moving and powerful in Canadian literature. For her, all of the stories show a master craftsman at work. &quot;Every story is expertly paced. The internal rhythm has been so perfected, the stories appear to unfold by themselves. There are no tricks; there is no visible or superimposed planning or plotting. Events unfold as unpredictably as life itself.&quot; The essayist Joshua Bodwell wrote about discovering MacLeod while traveling in Cape Breton just months before his first child was born, and then later reading &quot;The Boat&quot; aloud to her near her tenth birthday in his piece &quot;The Great Salt Gift of Alistair MacLeod&#x27;s &quot;The Boat.&quot;&quot;

The English literary critic, James Wood, on the other hand, criticized what he saw as &quot;a certain simplicity, even sentimentalism&quot; in many of the stories in &quot;Island&quot;. He also found some of them overly melodramatic adding: &quot;Several of MacLeod&#x27;s stories have a quality of emotional genre-painting, and display a willingness to let the complexities of character die into stereotype. The men are white-haired and silent, the women dark-haired with sharp tongues.&quot; Although Wood conceded MacLeod&#x27;s status as a writer, he pointed to certain flaws. &quot;MacLeod is a distinguished writer, but his strengths are inseparable from his weaknesses: the sincerity that produces his sentimentality also stirs his work to a beautifully aroused plainness.&quot; Wood singles out one story, &quot;The Tuning of Perfection&quot;, however, for its &quot;complete lack of sentimentality.&quot; He writes that by delicately retrieving the past, MacLeod achieves a fineness removed from much contemporary North American fiction. He concludes that in this story, MacLeod &quot;becomes only himself, provokingly singular and rare, an island of richness.&quot;

===Novel===
MacLeod&#x27;s 1999 novel, &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; tells the story of the red-haired and dark-eyed MacDonald clan from 1779 when they left Scotland to settle in Cape Breton to more recent times. The judges, who awarded MacLeod the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2001, described the novel as &quot;a story of families, and of the ties that bind us to them. It is also a story of exile and of the ties that bind us, generations later, to the land from which our ancestors came.&quot; They went on to predict that the quality of MacLeod&#x27;s writing would soon make his name a household word. &quot;The music of the Cape Breton rings throughout this book, by turns joyful and sad but always haunting. Written in a hypnotic, stately prose where every word is perfectly placed, &#x27;No Great Mischief&#x27; has the same haunting effect, and shows why the master craftsman took more than ten years to write it.&quot;

Those observations were echoed by many reviewers. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for example, Thomas Mallon praised the book&#x27;s lyricism and reported that &quot;MacLeod&#x27;s world of Cape Breton – with its Scottish fishermen and their displaced heirs, the miners and young professionals it has mournfully sent to the rest of the nation – has become a permanent part of my own inner library.&quot; Mallon&#x27;s main criticism was that parts of the novel came across as heavy handed, lacking the deftness of MacLeod&#x27;s short fiction. He ended, however, by noting that MacLeod&#x27;s entire body of work would soon be published in the U.S. granting American readers &quot;a new land that their imaginations can seize like a manifest destiny.&quot;

In the British newspaper, &quot;The Observer&quot;, Stephanie Merritt pointed out that when it was first published, &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; drew &quot;unqualified praise&quot; from the critics. Her review of the paperback edition concluded: &quot;In its poetic and emotional range, this is one of the richest novels of recent years.&quot;

The &quot;Globe and Mail&#x27;s&quot; critic Kenneth J. Harvey heaped praise on both the book and its author: &quot;The book has it all: beauty,
tragedy, grittiness, humour, darkness, love, music, raunchiness, poetry and a glut of fully drawn, extraordinary characters whose words and deeds and circumstances compel the reader to laugh and blush and weep and swell with bighearted pride...MacLeod is MacLeod, the greatest living Canadian writer and one of the most distinguished writers in the world. No Great Mischief is the book of the year – and of this decade. It is a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece.&quot;

==Scholarly studies==
MacLeod&#x27;s fiction has been studied extensively by post-graduate students. Their master&#x27;s and doctoral theses explore many aspects of his work including issues concerning regional and ethnic identity; the influence of island boundaries; magical thinking; and, the traditional roles of men and women. MacLeod&#x27;s work has been compared and, in some cases contrasted, with other Canadian authors such as David Adams Richards, Alden Nowlan, Wayne Johnston, Margaret Laurence, Hugh MacLennan and Ann-Marie MacDonald.

==Family==
MacLeod was married for nearly 43 years to the former Anita MacLellan. She grew up in a house on Cape Breton Island that was just a couple of miles from his. They were married on September 4, 1971. They had seven children: six sons and a daughter, with one son dying in infancy. Their oldest son Alexander MacLeod is also a writer, whose debut short story collection &quot;Light Lifting&quot; was a Scotiabank Giller Prize finalist in 2010.

==Death==
MacLeod died on April 20, 2014, after suffering a stroke in January 2014. He was 77. His Requiem Mass was held at St. Margaret of Scotland Catholic Church, in Broad Cove, near his home in Dunvegan. He was laid to rest in the nearby graveyard where generations of MacLeods are buried.

==Film about MacLeod==
He was the subject of a documentary film by the National Film Board, &quot;Reading Alistair MacLeod&quot;, released in 2005. The 88-minute film, directed by Bill MacGillivray, includes interviews with MacLeod, his wife Anita and other family members. Prominent writers such as Russell Banks, Colm Tóibín and David Adams Richards read from and comment on MacLeod&#x27;s writing. The film also features excerpts from composer Christopher Donison&#x27;s opera &quot;Island&quot; based on one of MacLeod&#x27;s short stories.

==Awards and honours==
Macleod&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; won several awards including the International Dublin Literary Award, the Trillium Book Award, the Thomas Head Raddall Award, the Dartmouth Book &amp; Writing Award for Fiction, the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Awards for author of the year as well as fiction book of the year (2000) and the Atlantic Provinces Booksellers&#x27; Choice Award. In 2009, &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; was voted Atlantic Canada&#x27;s greatest book.

MacLeod won the Portia White Prize in 2001. The prize, awarded by the Province of Nova Scotia, honours artistic excellence and achievement.

In 2003, he won the Lannan Literary Award for fiction.

In 2008, MacLeod was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, the same year he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

In 2009, MacLeod received the PEN/Malamud Award for Short Fiction along with Amy Hempel.

MacLeod has been awarded more than a dozen honorary degrees including ones from his alma mater, St. Francis Xavier University, Cape Breton University, McGill University and the University of Prince Edward Island.

<text>Philip Michael Ondaatje (; born 12 September 1943) is a Sri Lankan-born Canadian poet, fiction writer and essayist.

Ondaatje&#x27;s literary career began with his poetry in 1967, publishing &quot;The Dainty Monsters&quot;, and then in 1970 the critically acclaimed &quot;The Collected Works of Billy the Kid.&quot; His novel &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1992), adapted into a film in 1996 and won the 1992 Golden Man Booker Prize.

Ondaatje has been &quot;fostering new Canadian writing&quot; with two decades commitment to Coach House Press (ca. 1970–1990), and his editorial credits include the journal &quot;Brick&quot;, and the &quot;Long Poem Anthology&quot; (1979), among others.

==Early life and education==

Ondaatje was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 1943, to Major Mervyn Ondaatje and Doris Gratiaen of Tamil and Burgher descent (Dutch and Sinhalese). In 1954, he re-joined his mother in England. where he attended Dulwich College. He emigrated to Montreal, Quebec, in 1962, studying at Bishop&#x27;s College School and Bishop&#x27;s University in Lennoxville, Quebec, for three years. He attended the University of Toronto receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965, followed by a Master of Arts from Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston.

The poet D. G. Jones noted his poetic ability.

Ondaatje began teaching English at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. In 1971, he taught English literature at Glendon College, York University.

==Work==

Ondaatje has published 13 books of poetry, and won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for &quot;The Collected Works of Billy the Kid&quot; (1970) and &quot;There&#x27;s a Trick With a Knife I&#x27;m Learning to Do: Poems 1973–1978&quot; (1979). Anil&#x27;s Ghost (2000) was the winner of the 2000 Giller Prize, the Prix Médicis, the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize, the 2001 Irish Times International Fiction Prize and Canada&#x27;s Governor General&#x27;s Award.

&quot;The English Patient&quot; (1992) won the Booker Prize, the Canada Australia Prize, and the Governor General&#x27;s Award. It was adapted as a motion picture, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture and multiple other awards.

&quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot; (1987), a novel about early immigrants in Toronto, was the winner of the 1988 City of Toronto Book Award, finalist for the 1987 Ritz Paris Hemingway Award for best novel of the year in English, and winner of the first Canada Reads competition in 2002. &quot;Coming Through Slaughter&quot; (1976), is a novel set in New Orleans, Louisiana, circa 1900, loosely based on the lives of jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden and photographer E. J. Bellocq. It was the winner of the 1976 Books in Canada First Novel Award. &quot;Running in the Family&quot; (1982) is a childhood memoir.

Ondaatje&#x27;s novel &quot;Divisadero&quot; won the 2007 Governor General&#x27;s Award. In 2011 Ondaatje worked with Daniel Brooks to create a play based on this novel.

In 2018, his novel &quot;Warlight&quot; was longlisted for the Booker Prize.

==Adaptations==

&quot;The Collected Works of Billy the Kid&quot;, &quot;Coming Through Slaughter&quot; and &quot;Divisadero&quot; have been adapted for the stage and produced in theatrical productions across North America and Europe. In addition to &quot;The English Patient&quot; adaptation, Ondaatje&#x27;s films include a documentary on poet B.P. Nichol, &quot;Sons of Captain Poetry&quot;, and &quot;The Clinton Special: A Film About The Farm Show&quot;, which chronicles a collaborative theatre experience led in 1971 by Paul Thompson of Theatre Passe Muraille.

In 2002, Ondaatje published a non-fiction book, &quot;The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film&quot;, which won special recognition at the 2003 American Cinema Editors Awards, as well as a Kraszna-Krausz Book Award for best book of the year on the moving image.

==Honours==

In 1988, Ondaatje was made an Officer of the Order of Canada which was later upgraded to grade of Companion in 2016, the highest level of the order and two years later a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

In 2005, he received Sri Lanka Ratna, the highest honour given by the Government of Sri Lanka for foreign nationals.

In 2008, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2016, a new species of spider, &quot;Brignolia ondaatjei&quot;, discovered in Sri Lanka, was named after him.

==Public stand==

In April 2015, Ondaatje was one of several members of PEN American Center who withdrew as literary host when the organization gave its annual Freedom of Expression Courage award to &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;. The award came in the wake of the shooting attack on the magazine&#x27;s Paris offices in January 2015. Ondaatje, along with 60 other writers, signed a letter to PEN expressing concern that the award valorized &quot;selectively offensive material: material that intensifies the anti-Islamic, anti-Maghreb, anti-Arab sentiments already prevalent in the Western world.&quot;

==Personal life==

Since the 1960s, Ondaatje has been a poetry editor for Toronto&#x27;s Coach House Books. Ondaatje and his wife, Linda Spalding, a novelist and academic, co-edit &quot;Brick, A Literary Journal&quot;, with Michael Redhill, Michael Helm, and Esta Spalding. Ondaatje served as a founding member of the board of trustees of the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry from 2000 to 2018. He established the Gratiaen Trust in Sri Lanka that annually awards the Gratiaen Prize.

Ondaatje has two children with his first wife, Canadian artist Kim Ondaatje. His brother Sir Christopher Ondaatje is a philanthropist, businessman and author. Ondaatje&#x27;s nephew David Ondaatje is a film director and screenwriter, who made the 2009 film &quot;The Lodger&quot;.

<doc id="61823" wikidata="Q487136" url="?curid=61823" title="Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling">
<text>The Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling is the Academy Award given to the best achievement in makeup and hairstyling for film. Traditionally, three films have been nominated each year with exceptions in the early 1980s and 2002 when there were only two nominees; in 1999, when there were four nominees. Beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards, five films were nominated.

The competitive category was created in 1981 as the Academy Award for Best Makeup, after the academy received complaints that the makeup work in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980) was not being honored. Although no award was given to &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, an entire category dedicated to honoring makeup effects in film was created for subsequent ceremonies. Previously, makeup artists were only eligible for special achievement awards for their work.

Ahead of nominations, a shortlist of titles is chosen by the makeup branch&#x27;s executive committee and clips are screened by the members of the branch at an annual &quot;bake-off.&quot; After only two films were shortlisted in 2002, rules were installed requiring that seven finalists be chosen each year with the top three becoming nominees. Beginning in 2020, the shortlist expanded from seven finalists to ten.

In 2012, the category was given its current name for use in the 85th Academy Awards and onward. Makeup artist Rick Baker holds the record for both most wins (7) and most nominations (11) for this award.

==Special Achievement Awards==
Before 1981, Special Achievement Oscars were twice awarded to makeup artists for their work on a specific film:

* 1964 – William J. Tuttle for &quot;7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot; 
* 1968 – John Chambers for &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; 

==Hairstylists==
Starting in 1993, the award is to be shared with hairstylists if hair effects &quot;contribute greatly to the appearance and effect of the characters&quot;.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Films in dark blue background have received a Special/Honorary Award; those in yellow background have won a regular Academy Award of Merit.

==Shortlisted finalists==
Finalists for Best Makeup &amp; Hairstyling are selected by the Makeup &amp; Hairstylists Branch. Ten films are shortlisted. Prior to the 92nd Academy Awards, up to seven films were shortlisted. The full membership of the Makeup &amp; Hairstylists Branch is invited to view excerpts and is provided with supporting information at a &quot;bake-off&quot; where balloting determines the five nominees. These are the additional films that presented at the bake-off.

<doc id="61827" wikidata="Q106301" url="?curid=61827" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">
<text>The Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It has been awarded since the 9th Academy Awards to an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a supporting role in a film released that year. The award is traditionally presented by the previous year&#x27;s Best Supporting Actor winner. However, in recent years, it has shifted towards being presented by previous years’ Best Supporting Actress winners instead. In lieu of the traditional Oscar statuette, supporting acting recipients were given plaques up until the 16th Academy Awards, when statuettes were awarded to each category instead.

The Best Supporting Actress award has been presented a total of 88 times, to 86 actresses. The first winner was Gale Sondergaard for her role in &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot;. The most recent winner is Da&#x27;Vine Joy Randolph for her role in &quot;The Holdovers&quot;. The record for most wins is two, held jointly by Dianne Wiest and Shelley Winters. Each other recipient has only won once, in this category. Thelma Ritter has received the most nominations in the category, with six—although she never won. Hattie McDaniel made history in 1940, when she became the first person of color to win an Oscar in any category.

== Nominations process ==
Nominees are currently determined by single transferable vote within the actors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the Academy.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County; the ceremonies are always held the following year. For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months, from August 1 to July 31. For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the extended eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933. Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature is an Academy Award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the best animated feature film. An animated feature is defined by the academy as a film with a running time of more than 40 minutes in which characters&#x27; performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique, a significant number of the major characters are animated, and animation figures in no less than 75 percent of the running time. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in 2002 for films released in 2001.

The entire AMPAS membership has been eligible to choose the winner since the award&#x27;s inception. If there are sixteen or more films submitted for the category, the winner is voted from a shortlist of five films, otherwise there will only be three films on the shortlist.

==History==
For much of the Academy Awards&#x27; history, the AMPAS was resistant to the idea of a regular award for animated features, considering there were simply too few produced to justify such consideration. Instead, the Academy occasionally bestowed special Oscars for exceptional productions, usually for Walt Disney Pictures, such as for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in 1938, and the Special Achievement Academy Award for the live action/animated hybrid &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Toy Story&quot; in 1996. In fact, prior to the award&#x27;s creation, only one animated film was nominated for Best Picture: 1991&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, also by Disney.

By 2001, the rise of sustained competitors to Disney in the feature animated film market, such as DreamWorks Animation (founded by former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg), created an increase of film releases of significant annual number enough for AMPAS to reconsider. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first given out at the 74th Academy Awards, held on March 24, 2002. The academy included a rule that stated that the award would not be presented in a year in which fewer than eight eligible films opened in theaters. It dropped the rule on April 23, 2019, to make voting for animated films more acceptable. People in the animation industry, as well as fans, expressed hope that the prestige from this award and the resulting boost to the box office would encourage the increased production of animated features.

In 2009, when the nominee slots for Best Picture were doubled to ten, &quot;Up&quot; was nominated for both Animated Feature and Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards, the first to do so since the inception of the Animated Feature category. This feat was repeated the following year by &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;. From 2010 onward, with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category, Pixar (a perennial nominee) did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box-office receipts, while Pixar&#x27;s sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards but in similar response due to rivalry between critically-acclaimed animation studios outside of Disney.

At the same year, the Academy enacted a new rule regarding the motion capture technique employed in films such as &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011), directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg respectively, and how they might not be eligible in this category in the future. The new rule now reads &quot;An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of greater than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters’ performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique. Motion capture by itself is not an animation technique. In addition, a significant number of the major characters must be animated, and animation must figure in no less than 75 percent of the picture’s running time.&quot; This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009).

In 2022, it was unclear whether &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On&quot; would be eligible for the award at the 95th Academy Awards due to being a live-action/stop-motion animated hybrid. Director Dean Fleischer Camp said that he and A24 had to submit documentation in order to prove the film had enough animation to meet the award&#x27;s minimum requirements. The AMPAS officially deemed the film eligible for consideration in the Animated Feature category and was eventually nominated for said category.

*2005 and 2011 are the only two-time years that Disney and Pixar films were completely shut out of the Best Animated Feature category.

=== People ===
*Pete Docter has the most wins of any individual (3), and is tied with Hayao Miyazaki and Chris Sanders for the most nominations (4). Additionally, Miyazaki has the most wins and nominations for a non-US individual.
*Hayao Miyazaki became the oldest winner in 2024 at the age of 83; he previously held the record between 2003 and 2023. Andrew Stanton is the youngest winner, having done so at the age of 38.
*Ron Clements, Dean DeBlois, Travis Knight, and Tomm Moore are tied for receiving the most nominations without winning, with three each.
*In diversity, Brenda Chapman was the first woman to win for &quot;Brave&quot;, Peter Ramsey was the first black director to win for &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, and Yvett Merino was the first woman of color to win for &quot;Encanto&quot;.
*Byron Howard was the first queer person to win the award, doing so in 2017 for &quot;Zootopia&quot; and again in 2022 for &quot;Encanto.&quot; This also makes him the only two-time queer winner.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film is an award given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) as part of the annual Academy Awards, or Oscars, since the 5th Academy Awards (with different names), covering the year 1931–32, to the present.

From 1932 until 1970, the category was known as Short Subjects, Cartoons; and from 1971 to 1973 as Short Subjects, Animated Films. The present title began with the 46th Awards in 1974. During the first 5 decades of the award&#x27;s existence, awards were presented to the producers of the shorts. Current Academy rules, however, call for the award to be presented to &quot;the individual person most directly responsible for the concept and the creative execution of the film.&quot; Moreover, &quot;[i]n the event that more than one individual has been directly and importantly involved in creative decisions, a second statuette may be awarded.&quot;

Only American films were nominated for the award until the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) was nominated for &quot;The Romance of Transportation in Canada&quot; in 1952. The first non-English-language international short to win was Zagreb Film&#x27;s &quot;Ersatz (The Substitute)&quot; in 1961.

The first film to win in this category was &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; by Walt Disney, who has since held the category&#x27;s record for most nominations (39) and most wins (12). MGM&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; (1940–67) is the category&#x27;s most lauded animated series over all, being nominated for a total of 13 Oscars and winning 7. Warner Bros.&#x27;s &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series also had a big amount of 16 Oscar nominations and winning 5. Among international studios, the NFB has the most wins in this category, with 6 Oscars. The biggest showing from Britain in this category is Nick Park, with three wins: 1 for &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; and 2 for the &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; series.

The Academy defines &quot;short&quot; as being &quot;not more than 40 minutes, including all credits.&quot; Fifteen films are shortlisted before nominations are announced. In the listings below, the title shown in boldface was the winner of the award in that given year, followed by the other nominees for that year.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film is an award presented at the annual Academy Awards ceremony. The award has existed, under numerous names, since 1957.

From 1936 until 1956 there were two separate awards, &quot;Best Short Subject, One-reel&quot; and &quot;Best Short Subject, Two-reel&quot;, referring to the running time of eligible short films: a standard reel of 35 mm film is 1000 feet, or about 11 minutes of run time. A third category &quot;Best Short Subject, color&quot; was used only for 1936 and 1937. From the initiation of short subject awards for 1932 until 1935 the terms were &quot;Best Short Subject, comedy&quot; and &quot;Best Short Subject, novelty&quot;.

These categories were merged starting with the 1957 awards, under the name &quot;Short Subjects, Live Action Subjects&quot;, which was used until 1970. For the next three years after that, it was known as &quot;Short Subjects, Live Action Films&quot;. The current name for the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film was introduced in 1974.

Current Academy rules call for the award to be presented to &quot;the individual person most directly responsible for the concept and the creative execution of the film. In the event that more than one individual has been directly and importantly involved in creative decisions, a second statuette may be awarded&quot;. The Academy defines &quot;short&quot; as being &quot;not more than 40 minutes, including all credits&quot;. Fifteen films are shortlisted before nominations are announced.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Cinematography is an Academy Award awarded each year to a cinematographer for work on one particular motion picture.

==History==
In its first film season, 1927–28, this award (like others such as the acting awards) was not tied to a specific film; all of the work by the nominated cinematographers during the qualifying period was listed after their names. The problem with this system became obvious the first year, since Karl Struss and Charles Rosher were nominated for their work together on &quot;.&quot; Still, three other films shot individually by either Rosher or Struss were also listed as part of the nomination. In the second year, 1929, there were no nominations at all, although the Academy has a list of unofficial titles that were under consideration by the Board of Judges. In the third year, 1930, films, not cinematographers, were nominated, and the final award did not show the cinematographer&#x27;s name.

Finally, for the 1931 awards, the modern system in which individuals are nominated for a single film was adopted in all profession-related categories. From 1939 to 1966 with the exception of 1957, there were also separate awards for color and black-and-white cinematography. After &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966), the most recent black-and-white films to win since then are &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), &quot;Roma&quot; (2018) and &quot;Mank&quot; (2020).

Floyd Crosby won the award for &quot;&quot; in 1931, which was the last silent film to win in this category. Hal Mohr won the only write-in Academy Award ever, in 1935 for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Mohr was also the first person to win for both black-and-white and color cinematography.

No winners are lost, although some of the earliest nominees (and of the unofficial nominees of 1928–29) are lost, including &quot;The Devil Dancer&quot; (1927), &quot;The Magic Flame&quot; (1927), and &quot;4 Devils&quot; (1928). &quot;The Right to Love&quot; (1930) is incomplete, and &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; (1927) is incomplete and partially reconstructed with stills.

David Lean holds the record for the director with the most films that won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the Oscars with five wins out of six nominations for &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

The first nominees shot primarily on digital video were &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; and &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; in 2009, with &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; being the first winner. The following year, &quot;Avatar&quot; was the first nominee and winner to be shot entirely on digital video.

In January 2017, Bradford Young became the first African-American cinematographer to be nominated for an Academy Award, for his work on &quot;Arrival&quot;.

In 2018, Rachel Morrison became the first woman to receive a nomination. Prior to that, it had been the last non-acting Academy Award category to never nominate a woman.

In 2019, Alfonso Cuarón became the first winner of this category to have also served as director on the film, for &quot;Roma&quot;. This followed a public dispute between Cuarón and the Academy over the Academy&#x27;s plan to shorten the Oscars broadcast by relegating four awards, including cinematography, to the commercial breaks in the show. Cuarón objected by saying, &quot;In the history of cinema, masterpieces have existed without sound, without color, without a story, without actors and without music. No single film has ever existed without cinematography ...&quot;

<text>Treponema pallidum, formerly known as &quot;Spirochaeta pallida&quot;, is a microaerophilic, gram-negative, spirochaete bacterium with subspecies that cause the diseases syphilis, bejel (also known as endemic syphilis), and yaws. It is known to be transmitted only among humans and baboons. &quot;T. pallidum&quot; can enter the host through mucosal membranes or open lesions in the skin and is primarily spread through sexual contact. It is a helically coiled microorganism usually 6–15 μm long and 0.1–0.2 μm wide. &quot;T. pallidum&quot;&#x27;s lack of both a tricarboxylic acid cycle and processes for oxidative phosphorylation results in minimal metabolic activity. As a chemoorganoheterotroph, &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; is an obligate parasite that acquires its glucose carbon source from its host. Glucose can be used not only as a primary carbon source but also in glycolytic mechanisms to generate ATP needed to power the bacterium given its minimal genome. The treponemes have cytoplasmic and outer membranes. Using light microscopy, treponemes are visible only by using dark-field illumination. &quot;T. pallidum&quot; consists of three subspecies, &quot;T. p. pallidum, T. p. endemicum,&quot; and &quot;T. p. pertenue,&quot; each of which has a distinct related disorder. The ability of &quot;T. pallidum&quot; to avoid host immune defenses has allowed for stealth pathogenicity. The unique outer membrane structure and minimal expression of surface proteins of &quot;T. pallidum&quot; has made vaccine development difficult. &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; can be treated with high efficacy by antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis such as the beta-lactam antimicrobial penicillin-G.

==Subspecies==
Three subspecies of &quot;T. pallidum&quot; are known:
* &quot;Treponema pallidum pallidum&quot;, which causes syphilis
* &quot;T. p. endemicum&quot;, which causes bejel or endemic syphilis
* &quot;T. p. pertenue&quot;, which causes yaws

The three subspecies causing yaws, bejel, and syphilis are morphologically and serologically indistinguishable. The three subspecies can be distinguished by genetics, using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), which utilizes techniques such as PCR, restriction digest and gel electrophoresis. Genes &quot;TprC&quot;, &quot;TprI&quot;, and the 5&#x27; flanking region of &quot;tpp15&quot; can be used to differentiate between the three subspecies based on DNA fragment lengths and location of bands in gel electrophoresis. These bacteria were originally classified as members of separate species, but DNA hybridization analysis indicates they are members of the same species. &quot;Treponema carateum&quot;, the cause of pinta, remains a separate species because no isolate is available for DNA analysis. Disease transmittance in subspecies &quot;T. p. endemicum&quot; and &quot;T. p. pertenue&quot; is considered non-venereal. &quot;T. p. pallidum&quot; is the most invasive pathogenic subspecies, while &quot;T. carateum&quot; is the least invasive of the species. &quot;T. p. endemicum&quot; and &quot;T. p. pertenue&quot; are intermediately invasive.

== Laboratory identification ==

&quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; was first microscopically identified in syphilitic chancres by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann at the Charité in Berlin in 1905. Historically, this bacterium was identified in the clinical laboratory through visualization in dark field microscopy. This bacterium can be detected with special stains, such as the Dieterle stain. &quot;T. pallidum&quot; is also detected by serology, including nontreponemal VDRL, rapid plasma reagin, treponemal antibody tests (FTA-ABS), &quot;T. pallidum&quot; immobilization reaction, and syphilis TPHA test.

== Microbiology ==
===Physiology===

&quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; is a helically shaped bacterium with high motility consisting of an outer membrane, peptidoglycan layer, inner membrane, protoplasmic cylinder, and periplasmic space. It is often described as gram-negative, but its outer membrane lacks lipopolysaccharide, which is found in the outer membrane of other gram-negative bacteria. It has an endoflagellum (periplasmic flagellum) consisting of four main polypeptides, a core structure, and a sheath. The flagellum is located within the periplasmic space and wraps around the protoplasmic cylinder. The peptidoglycan layer interacts with the endoflagellum which may aid in motility. &quot;T. pallidum&quot;&#x27;s outer membrane has the most contact with host cells and contains few transmembrane proteins, limiting antigenicity, while its cytoplasmic membrane is covered in lipoproteins. The outer membrane&#x27;s treponemal ligands&#x27; main function is attachment to host cells, with functional and antigenic relatedness between ligands. The genus &quot;Treponema&quot; has ribbons of cytoskeletal cytoplasmic filaments that run the length of the cell just underneath the cytoplasmic membrane.

==== Outer membrane ====
The outer membrane (OM) of &quot;T. pallidum&quot; has several features that have made it historically difficult to research. These include details such as its low protein content, its fragility, and that it contains fewer gene sequences related to other gram negative outer membranes. Progress has been made using genomic sequencing and advanced computational models. The treponemal outer membrane proteins are key factors for the bacterium&#x27;s pathogenesis, persistence, and immune evasion strategies. The relatively low protein content prevents antigen recognition by the immune system and the proteins that do exist protrude out of the OM, enabling its interaction with the host. &quot;Treponema&#x27;s&quot; reputation as a &quot;stealth pathogen&quot; is primarily due to this unique OM structure, which serves to evade immune detection.

=====TP0126=====

The TP0126 protein has been linked to the outer membrane protein family (OMP). This protein will sit in the outer membrane like a porin, which is supported by circular dichroism recombinant TP0126, and will increase the virulence factor. Researchers have classified the TP0126 protein in this class due to the homology between the protein and the porins of the OMPs. This protein is encoded by the tp0126 gene, which is conserved over all strains of &quot;T. pallidum.&quot; 

===== TP0326 =====
TP0326 is an ortholog of the β-barrel assembly machine Bam A. BamA apparatus inserts newly synthetized and exported outer membrane proteins into the outer membrane.

===== TP0453 =====
TP0453 is a 287 amino acid protein associated with the inner membrane of the microbe&#x27;s outer membrane. This protein lacks the extensive beta sheet structure that is characteristic of other membrane proteins, and does not traverse the outer membrane. This protein&#x27;s function has been hypothesized to be involved with control of nutrient uptake.

===== TP0624 =====
Outer Membrane Protein A (OmpA) domain-containing proteins are necessary for maintaining structural integrity in gram-negative bacteria. These domains contain peptidoglycan binding sites which creates a &quot;structural bridge between the peptidoglycan layer and the outer memebrane.&quot; The protein TP0624 found in &quot;T.&quot; &quot;pallidum&quot; has been proposed to facilitate this structural link, as well as interactions between outer membrane proteins and corresponding domains on the thin peptidoglycan layer.

=====TP0751=====

The TP0751 protein is a protein that is unique to &quot;T. pallidum&quot;, and it is thought to aid in attachment to the host&#x27;s extra cellular membrane. Since this protein aids in the attachment to the host, it sits on the surface of the cells, and in 2005, it was discovered that the TP0751 protein will attach to the laminin component in the host&#x27;s extracellular matrix. With that, it is thought that the TP0751 protein plays a key role in dissemination with the host.

===== TP0965 =====
TP0965 is a protein that is critical for membrane fusion in &quot;T. pallidum&quot;, and is located in the periplasm. TP0965 causes endothelial barrier dysfunction, a hallmark of late-stage pathogenesis of syphilis. It does this by reducing the expression of tight junction proteins, which in turn increases the expression of adhesion molecules and endothelial cell permeability, which eventually leads to disruption of the endothelial layer.

=== Treponema repeat family of proteins ===
The &quot;Treponema&quot; repeat family of proteins (Tpr) are proteins expressed during the infection process. Tprs are formed by a conserved N-terminal domain, an amino-terminal stretch of about 50 amino acids, a central variable region, and a conserved C-terminal domain. The many different types of Tpr include TprA, TprB, TprC, TprD, and TprE, but variability of TprK is the most relevant due to the immune escape characteristics it allows.

Antigen variation in TprK is regulated by gene conversion. In this way, fragments of the seven variable regions (V1–V7), by nonreciprocal recombination, present in TprK and the 53 donor sites of TprD can be combined to produce new structured sequences. TprK antigen variation can help &quot;T. pallidum&quot; to evade a strong host immune reaction and can also allow the reinfection of individuals. This is possible because the newly structured proteins can avoid antibody-specific recognition. This is possible because the newly structured proteins can avoid antibody-specific recognition. It is also suspected that the genes that encode for the TprK protein are essential in pathogenesis during the infection of syphilis.

To introduce more phenotypic diversity, &quot;T. pallidum&quot; may undergo phase variation. This process mainly happens in TprF, TprI, TprG, TprJ, and TprL, and it consists of a reversible expansion or contraction of polymeric repeats. These size variations can help the bacterium to quickly adapt to its microenvironment, dodge immune response, or even increase affinity to its host.

===Culture===
In the past century since its initial discovery, culturing the bacteria in vitro has been difficult. Without the ability to grow and maintain the bacteria in a laboratory setting, discoveries regarding its metabolism and antimicrobial sensitivity were greatly impaired. However, successful long-term cultivation of &quot;T.&quot; &quot;pallidum&quot; in vitro was reported in 2017. This was achieved using Sf1Ep epithelial cells from rabbits, which were a necessary condition for the continued multiplication and survival of the system. The medium TpCM-2 was used, an alteration of more simple media which previously only yielded a few weeks of culture growth. This success was the result of switching out minimal essential medium (MEM) with CMRL 1066, a complex tissue culture medium. With development, new discoveries about &quot;T.&quot; &quot;pallidum&quot;&#x27;s requirements for growth and gene expression may occur and in turn, yield research beneficial for the treatment and prevention of syphilis, outside of a host. However, continuous efforts to grow &quot;T. pallidum&quot; in axenic culture have been unsuccessful, indicating that it does not satisfy Koch&#x27;s postulates. The challenge likely stems from the organism&#x27;s strong adaptation to residing in mammalian tissue, resulting in a reduced genome and significant impairments in metabolic and biosynthetic functions.

==Genome==
The genome of &quot;T. pallidum&quot; was first sequenced in 1998. It is characterized by its helical, corkscrew-like shape. &quot;T. pallidum&quot; is not obtainable in a pure culture, meaning that this sequencing played an important role in filling gaps of understanding regarding the microbes&#x27; functions. The DNA sequences of &quot;T. pallidum&quot; species are more than 99.7% identical, and PCR-based assays are effective at differentiating these species. About 92.9% of DNA was determined to be open reading frames, 55% of which had predicted biological functions. &quot;T. pallidum&quot; was found to rely on its host for many molecules typically provided by biosynthetic pathways, and it is missing genes responsible for encoding key enzymes in oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The &quot;T. pallidum&quot; group and its reduced genome is likely the result of various adaptations, such that it no longer contains the ability to synthesize fatty acids, nucleic acids, and amino acids, instead relying on its mammalian hosts for these materials. The recent sequencing of the genomes of several spirochetes permits a thorough analysis of the similarities and differences within this bacterial phylum and within the species. The chromosomes of the &quot;T. pallidum&quot; species are small, about 1.14 Mbp. It has one of the smallest bacterial genomes and has limited metabolic capabilities, reflecting its adaptation through genome reduction to the rich environment of mammalian tissue. It conserves almost 99.8% of its small genome, and uses its constantly mutating protein TprK to avoid immune response from its host. To avoid antibodies attacking it, the cell has few proteins exposed on the outer membrane sheath. Its chromosome is about 1000 kilobase pairs and is circular with a 52.8% G + C average. Sequencing has revealed a bundle of 12 proteins and some putative hemolysins are potential virulence factors of &quot;T. pallidum.&quot; These virulence factors are thought to contribute to the bacterium&#x27;s ability to evade the immune system and cause disease.

==Clinical significance==
The clinical features of syphilis, yaws, and bejel occur in multiple stages that affect the skin. The skin lesions observed in the early stage last for weeks or months. The skin lesions are highly infectious, and the spirochetes in the lesions are transmitted by direct contact. The lesions regress as the immune response develops against &quot;T. pallidum&quot;. The latent stage that results can last a lifetime in many cases. In a few cases, the disease exits latency and enters a tertiary phase, in which destructive lesions of skin, bone, and cartilage ensue. Unlike yaws and bejels, syphilis in its tertiary stage often affects the heart, eyes, and nervous system, as well.

===Syphilis===

&quot;Treponema pallidum pallidum&quot; is a motile spirochete that is generally acquired by close sexual contact, entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar epithelium. The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by transplacental passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis. The helical structure of &quot;T. p. pallidum&quot; allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin. In women, the initial lesion is usually on the labia, the walls of the vagina, or the cervix; in men, it is on the shaft or glans of the penis. It gains access to the host&#x27;s blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucous membranes. In more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body.

The incubation period for a &quot;T. p. pallidum&quot; infection is usually around 21 days, but can range from 10 to 90 days.

=== Yaws ===

The causative agent of yaws is &quot;Treponema pallidum pertenue&quot;, which is transmissible by direct physical contact between infected people. Yaws is not sexually transmitted, and occurs in tropical, humid environments of Africa, Pacific Islands, Asia and South America. Unlike syphilis, which displays vertical transmission, one strain of &quot;T. p. pertenue&quot; researched was not vertically transmissible in a guinea pig model, and yaws cannot be spread from mother to offspring. Yaws appears as skin lesions, usually papules, commonly on the lower extremities, but present in other areas such as the arms, trunk and hands. Three stages of yaws disease have been documented: primary yaws which presents as inflamed sores on the lower body, secondary yaws which presents as a variety of skin abnormalities along with bone inflammation, and tertiary yaws, also referred to as latent yaws, which occurs when &quot;T. p. pertenue&quot; is serologically detected in the host but no clinical signs are displayed until relapse, which often occurs years later. Yaws is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin and benzathine penicillin-G.

=== Bejel ===
Bejel is caused by &quot;Treponema pallidum endemicum&quot; and is a disease is that endemic in hot and dry climates. The transmission path has not been fully mapped, however infections are thought to be transmitted via direct contact with lesion secretions or fomites rather than by sexual transmission. Bejel typically causes skin lesions, which first appear as small ulcers in the mouth, and secondary lesions that form in the oropharynx, or around the nipples of nursing women. Bejel can be treated with benzathine penicillin-G.

==Treatment==
During the early 1940s, rabbit models in combination with the drug penicillin allowed for a long-term drug treatment. These experiments established the groundwork that modern scientists use for syphilis therapy. Penicillin can inhibit &quot;T. pallidum&quot; in 6–8 hours, though the cells still remain in lymph nodes and regenerate. Penicillin is not the only drug that can be used to inhibit &quot;T. pallidum&quot;; any β-lactam antibiotics or macrolides can be used. The &quot;T. pallidum&quot; strain 14 has built-in resistance to some macrolides, including erythromycin and azithromycin. Resistance to macrolides in &quot;T. pallidum&quot; strain 14 is believed to derive from a single-point mutation that increased the organism&#x27;s livability. Many of the syphilis treatment therapies only lead to bacteriostatic results, unless larger concentrations of penicillin are used for bactericidal effects. Penicillin overall is the most recommended antibiotic by the Centers for Disease Control, as it shows the best results with prolonged use. It can inhibit and may even kill &quot;T. pallidum&quot; at low to high doses, with each increase in concentration being more effective. The Guideline Development Group has recommended the development of a new treatment, a short course treatment that is administered orally and can cross the placental barriers in pregnant women.

==Vaccine==
No vaccine for syphilis is available as of 2024, but doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis can be used to prevent infections. The outer membrane of &quot;T. pallidum&quot; has too few surface proteins for an antibody to be effective. Efforts to develop a safe and effective syphilis vaccine have been hindered by uncertainty about the relative importance of humoral and cellular mechanisms to protective immunity, and because &quot;T. pallidum&quot; outer membrane proteins have not been unambiguously identified. In contrast, some of the known antigens are intracellular, and antibodies are ineffective against them to clear the infection. In the last century, several prototypes have been developed, and while none of them provided protection from the infection, some prevented bacteria from disseminating to distal organs and promoted accelerated healing.

<text>Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as gonococcus (singular) or gonococci (plural), is a species of Gram-negative diplococci bacteria first isolated by Albert Neisser in 1879. An obligate human pathogen, it primarily colonizes the mucosal lining of the urogenital tract; however, it is also capable of adhering to the mucosa of the nose, pharynx, rectum, and conjunctiva. It causes the sexually transmitted genitourinary infection gonorrhea as well as other forms of gonococcal disease including disseminated gonococcemia, septic arthritis, and gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.

&quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is oxidase positive and a microaerophile that is capable of surviving phagocytosis and growing inside neutrophils. Culturing it requires carbon dioxide supplementation and enriched agar (chocolate agar) with various antibiotics (Thayer–Martin). It exhibits antigenic variation through genetic recombination of its pili and surface proteins that interact with the immune system.

Sexual transmission is through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Sexual transmission may be prevented through the use of barrier protection. Perinatal transmission may occur during childbirth, though it is preventable through antibiotic treatment of the mother before birth and application of antibiotic eye gel on the eyes of the newborn. Gonococcal infections do not result in protective immunity; therefore, individuals may be infected multiple times. Reinfection is possible due to &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&#x27;s&quot; ability to evade the immune system by varying its surface proteins.

Asymptomatic infection is common in both males and females. Untreated infection may spread to the rest of the body (disseminated gonorrhea infection), especially the joints (septic arthritis). Untreated infection in women may cause pelvic inflammatory disease and possible infertility due to the resulting scarring. Gonorrhoea is diagnosed through cultures, Gram staining, or nucleic acid tests (i.e. polymerase chain reaction) of urine samples, urethral swabs, or cervical swabs. Chlamydia co-testing and testing for other STIs is recommended due to high rates of co-infection.

Antibiotic resistance in &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is a growing public health concern, especially given its propensity to develop resistance easily. This ability of &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; to rapidly adapt to novel antimicrobial treatments has been seen several times since the 1930s, making numerous treatment plans obsolete. Some strains have exhibited resistance to the current ceftriaxone treatments.

== Microbiology ==

&quot;Neisseria&quot; species are fastidious, Gram-negative cocci (though some species are rod-shaped and occur in pairs or short chains) that require nutrient supplementation to grow in laboratory cultures. They are facultative intracellular pathogens, meaning they are able to persist and colonize within host cells but can also multiply outside the host cellular environment. They typically appear in pairs (diplococci), resembling the shape of coffee beans. Members of this genus do not form endospores and are nonmotile, with the exception of pathogenic species, which capable of moving using twitching motility; most are also obligate aerobes. Of the 17 species that colonize humans, only two are pathogenic: &quot;N. gonorrhoeae,&quot; which causes gonorrhea, and &quot;N. meningitidis&quot;, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis.

=== Culture and identification ===

&quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; can be isolated on Thayer–Martin agar (or VPN) agar in an atmosphere enriched with 3-7% carbon dioxide. Thayer–Martin agar is a chocolate agar plate (heated blood agar) containing nutrients and antimicrobials (vancomycin, colistin, nystatin, and trimethoprim). This agar preparation facilitates the growth of &quot;Neisseria&quot; species while inhibiting the growth of contaminating bacteria and fungi. Martin Lewis and New York City agar are other types of selective chocolate agar commonly used for &quot;Neisseria&quot; growth. &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is oxidase positive (possessing cytochrome c oxidase) and catalase positive (able to convert hydrogen peroxide to oxygen). When incubated with the carbohydrates lactose, maltose, sucrose, and glucose, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; will oxidize only the glucose.

== Metabolism ==

=== Carbon ===
Unlike other &quot;Neisseria&quot; species that can also metabolize maltose, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is capable of using only glucose, pyruvate, and lactate as central carbon sources, and glucose is catabolized via both the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) and pentose phosphate (PP) pathways,and the ED pathway is the primary oxidative method. Use of these pathways is necessary as &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is incapable of glucose catabolism via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway due its lack of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) gene; however, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase enzyme is present to allow for gluconeogenesis to occur.

Glucose is first metabolized through the ED pathway to produce pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the latter of which can then further metabolized by enzymes of the EMP pathway to yield another molecule of pyruvate. The resultant pyruvate molecules are then converted into acetyl-CoA, which can then be incorporated as a substrate for the citric acid cycle (CAC) to yield high-energy electron carriers that will be used by the electron transport chain (ETC) for ATP production; however, the CAC is largely used for generating biosynthetic precursors rather than for catabolic purposes. This is due in part to inhibited expression of several CAC enzymes in the presence of glucose, pyruvate, or lactate. These enzymes, namely citrate synthase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, are needed for the incorporation of acetate. Instead, a partial CAC has been observed, where α-ketoglutarate is formed by glutamate dehydrogenase or transamination of oxaloacetate and glutamate by aspartate aminotransferase (yielding aspartate and α-ketoglutarate). The CAC then continues from there to yield oxaloacetate, which is an important precursor molecule for a number of biosynthetic pathways. Another differentiating aspect of the gonococcal CAC is the lack of malate dehydrogenase, which is instead replaced by a membrane-bound malate:quinone-oxidoreductase that operates independently of NAD+ by directly transferring electrons to ubiquinone.

Conversely, acetyl-CoA that does not enter the CAC but enters the phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (PTA-AckA) pathway, where it can be converted into acetate by phosphorylation (to form acetyl phosphate and release coenzyme A) and dephosphorylation to form ATP. While this acetate can enter the CAC for further oxidation, this does not occur so long as other carbon sources such as glucose or lactate are present, in which case it is excreted from the cell or incorporated for lipid synthesis. &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; lack the glyoxylate shunt, preventing them from using acetate to form CAC intermediates to replenish the cycle.

A significant portion of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate formed in gonococci is recycled via the gluconeogenic pathway to reform glucose 6-phosphate, as well as the intermediate fructose 6-phosphate. Both of these can then be used for pentose synthesis in the PP pathway via the oxidative and non-oxidative pathways, respectively, for subsequent nucleotide formation as well as energy production.

&quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;, like other pathogenic members of the genus &quot;Neisseria&quot;, are capnophiles, meaning they require higher-than-normal concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) to grow , either in the form of CO2 or bicarbonate (HCO3−) depending on the bacterial strain. This requirement must be met exogenously during the lag and stationary growth phases, though it appears to be met through high metabolic CO2 productions in the exponential phase. Assimilation of this CO2 in &quot;Neisseria&quot; species is done by carbonic anhydrase and phosphoenolpyruvate enzymes in the periplasmic space and the cytoplasm, respectively.

Lactate catabolism is also of particular importance for gonococci, both for pathogenicity and for growth. External lactate is transported in to the cell via lactate permease (LctP). The &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; genome encodes for three lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes for that allow for metabolism of both &quot;L&quot;-lactate and &quot;D&quot;-lactate: a cytoplasmic NAD+-dependent &quot;D&quot;-lactate dehydrogenase (LdhA), which is responsible for and two membrane-bound LDHs, one specific to &quot;L&quot;-lactate (LldD) and the other specific to &quot;D&quot;-lactate (LdhD). The membrane-bound LDHs have been determined to be flavoprotein-containing respiratory enzymes that directly oxidize lactate to reduce ubiquinone. While these enzymes do not directly pump protons (H+ ions) into the periplasmic space, it is proposed that the reduction of ubiquinone by these enzymes is capable of feeding into the larger ETC.

=== Electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation ===
As an obligate human pathogen and a facultative anaerobic capnophile, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; typically colonize mucosal surfaces in microaerobic environments, such as those in the genitourinary tract. Growth in areas where oxygen concentrations are limited requires a terminal oxidase with a high affinity for oxygen; in gonococci, oxygen reduction is performed by a &quot;ccb3&quot; -type cytochrome oxidase. In addition to aerobic respiration, gonococci can also perform anaerobic respiration via the reduction of nitrite (NO2) to nitric oxide (NO) as well as reduction of NO to nitrous oxide (N2O).

There are several enzymes that contribute electrons to the intramembranous ubiquinone pool, the first step in the ETC. These include the membrane bound LDHs (LldD and LdhD), NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (aka NADH dehydrogenase; Nuo complex I), Na+-translocating NADH dehydrogenase (Nqr), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and the membrane-bound NAD+-independent malate:quinone-oxidoreductase (MqR).

Following the initial transfer of electrons to ubiquinone, proposed schematics for the organization of the gonococcal ETC suggest the electrons can be further passed down the chain by reduction of the cytochrome &quot;bc1&quot; complex or can be directly transferred to NO as a terminal electron acceptor by NO reductase (NorB). In the case of the former, electrons can then be passed from the &quot;bc1&quot; complex along two alternative pathways via the reduction of either cytochrome &quot;c4&quot; or &quot;c5&quot;. Both of these cytochromes transfer electrons to the terminal cytochrome &quot;ccb3&quot; oxidase for the reduction of O2 to form H2O under aerobic conditions.

Gonococci are also reduce NO2 via an inducible outer membrane-attached copper-containing nitrite reductase (AniA, a member of the NirK protein family) under anaerobic conditions, though this process has also been noted in microaerobic conditions as a means of supplementing growth. This leads to the formation of NO that is subsequently reduced to N2O in a partial denitrification pathway. The &quot;ccb3&quot; oxidase of &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;, dissimilarly to other members of the &quot;Neisseria&quot; genus, is a tri-heme protein that can transfer electrons not only to O2 (conserved across &quot;Neisseria&quot; species) but also to AniA for NO2 reduction. This is in addition to the typical process of receiving electrons transferred from cytochrome &quot;c5&quot;.

The general purpose of the ETC is the formation of the electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions (H+ or protons), resulting from concentration differences across the plasma membrane, needed to power ATP production in a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. In gonococci, movement of protons into the periplasmic space is accomplished by the Nuo complex I, the cytochrome &quot;bc1&quot; complex, and cytochrome &quot;ccb3&quot;. Subsequently, ATP synthesis is performed by the F1F0 ATP synthase, a two-part protein complex present in gonococci as well as numerous other species across phylogenetic domains. This complex couples proton translocation back into the cytoplasm along its gradient with mechanical rotation to generate ATP.

=== Iron ===
The general purpose of the ETC is the formation of the electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions (H+ or protons), resulting from concentration differences across the plasma membrane, needed to power ATP production in a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. In gonococci, movement of protons into the periplasmic space is accomplished by the Nuo complex I, the cytochrome &quot;bc1&quot; complex, and cytochrome &quot;ccb3&quot;. Subsequently, ATP synthesis is performed by the F1F0 ATP synthase, a two-part protein complex present in gonococci as well as numerous other species across phylogenetic domains. This complex couples proton translocation back into the cytoplasm along its gradient with mechanical rotation to generate ATP.

To acquire the necessary iron, gonococci produce TonB-dependent transporters (TDTs) on the surface of their outer membrane that are able to directly extract iron, along with other metals, from their respective carrier proteins. Some of these include transferrin binding proteins A (TbpA) and B (TbpB), lactoferrin-binding proteins A (LbpA) and B (LbpB), and hemoglobin/hemoglobin-haptoglobin binding proteins HpuB and HpuA. In addition to these proteins, gonococci are also capable of using siderophores, or compounds that are capable of chelating iron in the environment, that are produced by other bacteria; however, gonococcal cells are incapable of synthesizing siderophores themselves. These xenosiderophores are taken up by the TDT FetA through the outer membrane and then brought into the cell by the &quot;fetBCDEF&quot; transporter system.

Along with the sequestration defence that can be further upregulated by host inflammation, humans also produce siderocalins that are able to chelate siderophores to as a further method of inhibiting pathogenic bacterial growth. These are sometimes ineffective against &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;, which is able to colonize intracellularly, particularly in phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. Increases in host intracellular iron also down regulates some of the intracellular pathogen-killing mechanisms; coincidentally, pathogenic &quot;Neisseria&quot; are able to alter several host cell mechanisms that ultimately allow the pathogen to take most of the available iron away from the host immune cell.

=== Surface molecules ===
On its surface, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; bears hair-like pili, surface proteins with various functions, and sugars called lipooligosaccharide. The pili mediate adherence, movement, and DNA exchange. The opacity-associated (Opa) proteins interact with the immune system, as do the porins. Lipooligosaccharide is an endotoxin that provokes an immune response. All of these are antigenic and exhibit antigenic variation. The pili, Opa proteins, porins, and even the lipooligosaccharide have mechanisms to inhibit the immune response, making asymptomatic infection possible.

==== Opa proteins ====
Phase-variable opacity-associated (Opa) adhesin proteins are used by &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; as part of evading immune response in a host cell. At least 12 Opa proteins are known and the many variations of surface proteins make recognizing &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; and mounting a defense by immune cells more difficult. Opa proteins are in the outer membrane and facilitate a response when the bacteria interacts with a variety of host cells. These proteins bind to various epithelial cells, and allow &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; to increase the length of infection as well as increase the amount of invasion into other host cells.

==== Type IV pili ====

Dynamic polymeric protein filaments called type IV pili allow &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; to do many bacterial processes including adhesion to surfaces, transformation competence, twitching motility, and immune response evasions. To enter the host the bacteria uses the pili to adhere to and penetrate mucosal surfaces. The pili are a pivotal virulence factor for &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;; without them, the bacterium is unable to promote colonization. For motility, individual bacteria use their pili in a manner that resembles a grappling hook: first, they are extended from the cell surface and attach to a substrate. Subsequent pilus retraction drags the cell forward. The resulting movement is referred to as twitching motility. &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is able to pull 100,000 times its own weight, and the pili used to do so are amongst the strongest biological motors known to date, exerting one nanonewton. The PilF and PilT ATPase proteins are responsible for powering the extension and retraction of the type IV pilus, respectively. The adhesive functions of the gonococcal pilus play a role in microcolony aggregation and biofilm formation. These pili are also used to avoid immune responses from the cell they are invading by having their type IV pili antigenically vary. The main pilus filament is replaced by variable DNA sequences very frequently. By doing this process rapidly, they are able to create a diversity of pili on their surface and evade the host cell&#x27;s immune response.

==== Lipooligosaccharide ====
Lipooligosaccharide is a low-weight version of lipopolysaccharide present on the surfaces of most other Gram-negative bacteria. It is a sugar (saccharide) side chain attached to lipid A (thus &quot;lipo-&quot;) in the outer membrane coating the cell wall of the bacteria. The root &quot;oligo&quot; refers to the fact that it is a few sugars shorter than the typical lipopolysaccharide. As an endotoxin, it provokes inflammation. The shedding of lipooligosaccharide by the bacteria are sometimes responsible for issues associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Although it functions primarily as an endotoxin, lipooligosaccharide may disguise itself with host sialic acid and block initiation of the complement cascade.

=== Antigenic variation ===
&quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; evades the immune system through a process called antigenic variation. This process allows &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; to recombine its genes and alter the antigenic determinants that adorn its surface, such as the Type IV pili. Simply stated, the chemical composition of molecules are changed due to changes at the genetic level. &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is able to vary the composition of its pili and lipooligosaccharide. Of these, the pili exhibit the most antigenic variation due to chromosomal rearrangement. The &quot;pilS&quot; gene is an example of this ability to rearrange, as its combination with the &quot;pilE&quot; gene is estimated to produce over 100 variants of the PilE protein. These changes allow for adjustment to local environmental differences at the site of infection, evasion of recognition by targeted antibodies, and inhibit the formation of an effective vaccine.

In addition to gene rearrangement, it is also naturally competent, meaning it can acquire extracellular DNA from the environment via its type IV pilus, specifically proteins PilQ and PilT. These processes allow &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; to acquire and spread new genes, disguise itself with different surface proteins, and prevent the development of immunological memory – an ability which has contributed to antibiotic resistance and impeded vaccine development.

=== Phase variation ===
Phase variation is similar to antigenic variation, but instead of changes at the genetic level altering the composition of molecules, these genetic changes result in the activation or deactivation of a gene. Phase variation most often arises from a frameshift in the expressed gene. The Opa proteins of &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; rely strictly on phase variation. Every time the bacteria replicate, they may switch multiple Opa proteins on or off through slipped-strand mispairing. That is, the bacteria introduce frameshift mutations that bring genes in or out of frame. The result is that different Opa genes are translated every time. Pili are varied by antigenic variation, but also phase variation. Frameshifts occur in both the &quot;pilE&quot; and &quot;pilC&quot; genes, effectively turning off the expression of pili in situations when they are not needed, such as during intracellular colonization as opposed to extracellular mucosal cell surface adhesion.

===Survival of gonococci===
After gonococci invade and transcytose the host epithelial cells, they land in the submucosa, where neutrophils promptly consume them. The pili and Opa proteins on the surface may interfere with phagocytosis, but most gonococci end up in neutrophils. The exudates from infected individuals contain many neutrophils with ingested gonococci. Neutrophils release an oxidative burst of reactive oxygen species in their phagosomes to kill the gonococci. However, a significant fraction of the gonococci can resist killing through the action of their catalase which breaks down reactive oxygen species and is able to reproduce within the neutrophil phagosomes.

The bacterial RecA protein, which mediates repair of DNA damage, plays an important role in gonococcal survival. &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; may replace DNA damaged in neutrophil phagosomes with DNA from neighboring gonococci. The process in which recipient gonococci integrate DNA from neighboring gonococci into their genome is called transformation.
== Genome ==
The genomes of several strains of &quot;N&quot;. &quot;gonorrhoeae &quot;have been sequenced. Most of them are about 2.1 Mb in size and encode 2,100 to 2,600 proteins (although most seem to be in the lower range). For instance, strain NCCP11945 consists of one circular chromosome (2,232,025 bp) encoding 2,662 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) and one plasmid (4,153 bp) encoding 12 predicted ORFs. The estimated coding density over the entire genome is 87%, and the average G+C content is 52.4%, values that are similar to those of strain FA1090. The NCCP11945 genome encodes 54 tRNAs and four copies of 16S-23S-5S rRNA operons.

=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
Horizontal gene transfer, also termed lateral gene transfer, is the sharing of genetic information amongst living organisms. This transmission of information is a driving force of antibiotic resistance in &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;. Studies have identified that &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; has obtained methods of antimicrobial resistance by way of horizontal gene transfer from other &quot;Neisseria&quot; species including &quot;N.&quot; &quot;lactamica&quot;, &quot;N. macacae&quot;, and &quot;N. mucosa.&quot; 

Transformation in &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is performed by the type IV pilus, where the DNA is bound and brought into the cell, followed by processing and homologous recombination.

Found in some genomes of &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, the gonococcal genetic island (GGI), a genomic island (GI) specific to gonococci, has been identified as a mobile genetic element that is horizontally acquired. GGI is involved with antimicrobial resistance, transmission of genetic information, and iron acquisition. The genes within the gonococcal genetic island encode for the infamous type IV secretion system (T4SS), which is responsible for DNA secretion and is essential for biofilm formation.

In 2011, researchers at Northwestern University found evidence of a human DNA fragment in a &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; genome, the first example of horizontal gene transfer from humans to a bacterial pathogen.

== Disease ==
=== Symptoms ===
Symptoms of infection with &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; differ depending on the site of infection and many infections are asymptomatic independent of sex. Depending on the route of transmission, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; may cause infection of the throat (pharyngitis) or infection of the anus/rectum (proctitis).

Disseminated gonococcal infections can occur when &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; enters the bloodstream, often spreading to the joints and causing a rash (dermatitis-arthritis syndrome). Dermatitis-arthritis syndrome results in joint pain (arthritis), tendon inflammation (tenosynovitis), and painless non-pruritic (non-itchy) dermatitis. Disseminated infection and pelvic inflammatory disease in women tend to begin after menses due to reflux during menses, facilitating spread. In rare cases, disseminated infection may cause infection of the meninges of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or infection of the heart valves (endocarditis).

==== Male ====
In symptomatic men, the primary symptom of genitourinary infection is urethritis – burning with urination (dysuria), increased urge to urinate, and a pus-like (purulent) discharge from the penis. The discharge may be foul smelling. If untreated, scarring of the urethra may result in difficulty urinating. Infection may spread from the urethra in the penis to nearby structures, including the testicles (epididymitis/orchitis), or to the prostate (prostatitis).

==== Female ====
In symptomatic women, the primary symptoms of genitourinary infection are increased vaginal discharge, burning with urination (dysuria), increased urge to urinate, pain with intercourse, or menstrual abnormalities. Pelvic inflammatory disease results if &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; ascends into the pelvic peritoneum (via the cervix, endometrium, and fallopian tubes). The resulting inflammation and scarring of the fallopian tubes can lead to infertility and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease develops in 10 to 20% of the females infected with &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;.

==== Neonates (perinatal infection) ====
In perinatal infection, the primary manifestation is infection of the eye (neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum) when the newborn is exposed to &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; in the birth canal. The eye infection can lead to corneal scarring or perforation, ultimately resulting in blindness. If the newborn is exposed during birth, conjunctivitis occurs within 2–5 days after birth and is severe. Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, once common in newborns, is prevented by the application of erythromycin (antibiotic) gel to the eyes of babies at birth as a public health measure. Silver nitrate is no longer used in the United States.

===Transmission===
&quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is most often transmitted through vaginal, oral, or anal sex; nonsexual transmission is unlikely in adult infection. It can also be transmitted to a newborn during passage through the birth canal if the mother has an untreated genitourinary infection. Given the high rate of asymptomatic infection, it is recommended that pregnant women be tested for gonococcal infection prior to birth. Communal baths, shared towels or fabrics, rectal thermometers, and improper hand hygiene by caregivers have been identified as potential means of transmission in pediatric settings.

Traditionally, the bacterium was thought to move attached to spermatozoa, but this hypothesis did not explain female to male transmission of the disease. A recent study suggests that rather than &quot;surf&quot; on wiggling sperm, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; bacteria use pili to anchor onto proteins in the sperm and move through coital liquid.

=== Infection ===
Successful transmission is followed by adherence to the epithelial cells found at the infected mucosal site by the bacterium&#x27;s type IV pili. The pili&#x27;s ability to attach and subsequently retract pulls &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; towards the epithelial membrane at the surface of the mucosal cell. Post attachment, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; replicates its genome and divides to form microcolonies. Gonococcal infection is sometimes aided by the membrane cofactor protein, CD46, as it has been known to act as a receptor for gonococcal pilus. Additionally, interaction with pili has been shown to cause cytoskeletal rearrangement of the host cell, further demonstrating that gonococcal pili engagement disrupts the response of the host cell and increases the likelihood of successful infection. During growth and colonization, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from host immune cells that result in the recruitment of neutrophils to the area. These phagocytic cells typically take in foreign pathogens and destroy them, however, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;&#x27;s ability to manipulate the host cell response allows the pathogen to survive within these immune cells and evade elimination.

==== Laboratory diagnosis ====
The primary detection methods for &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; are nucleic acid amplification tests, which are the most sensitive techniques available. Other methods of detection include microscopy and culture.

=== Prevention ===
Transmission is reduced by using latex barriers (e.g. condoms or dental dams) during sex and by limiting sexual partners. Condoms and dental dams should be used during oral and anal sex as well. Spermicides, vaginal foams, and douches are not effective methods for transmission prevention.

==== Vaccine ====
A vaccine against &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is becoming more necessary due to the growing incidence of cases, increasing antimicrobial resistance, and its impact on reproductive health. There are problems that have hampered vaccine development including: the absence of immunity post-infection, exclusively human hosts, and antigenic and phase variation of potential vaccine targets. Currently, there are several &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; vaccines in development including an outer membrane vesicle vaccine. This includes the NGoXIM, the native OMV, and Bexsero/4CMenB vaccine candidates, which are all in the late clinical stages of development. The creation of a vaccine for &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; has several potential public health impacts. In one estimate, a vaccine for the heterosexual population given before sexual activity occurs showed that prevalence of &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; could be reduced by up to 90% after 20 years.

===Treatment===
Currently, the CDC recommends a single dose of the injectable cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, as the first line of defense against gonococcal infections. Individuals weighing less than 150 kg are typically prescribed a ceftriaxone concentration of 500 mg, while individuals who weigh over 150 kg are typically prescribed a dose of 1 g. Although ceftriaxone is not the only cephalosporin that has been effective at treating gonorrhoeae, it is the most advantageous. In the event of a cephalosporin allergy, the CDC recommends a dual treatment of gentamicin and azithromycin. Each drug should be administered as a single dose, with the gentamicin entering intramuscularly at a concentration of 240 mg, along with 2 g of azithromycin taken orally. If an individual is not allergic to cephalosporins but ceftriaxone is unavailable, an alternative treatment is a single dose of 800 mg cefixime consumed orally. In all of these cases, combination therapy and co-treatment for chlamydia is recommended, as simultaneous infections are common. 
==== Antibiotic resistance ====
Antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea was first identified in the 1940s. Gonorrhea was treated with penicillin, but doses had to be progressively increased to remain effective. By the 1970s, penicillin-and tetracycline-resistant gonorrhea emerged in the Pacific Basin. These resistant strains then spread to Hawaii, California, the rest of the United States, Australia and Europe. Fluoroquinolones were the next line of defense, but soon resistance to this antibiotic emerged, as well. Since 2007, standard treatment has been third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, which are considered to be our &quot;last line of defense&quot;. Recently, a high-level ceftriaxone-resistant strain of gonorrhea called H041 was discovered in Japan. Lab tests found it to be resistant to high concentrations of ceftriaxone, as well as most of the other antibiotics tested. Within &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;, genes exist that confer resistance to every single antibiotic used to cure gonorrhea, but thus far they do not coexist within a single gonococcus. However, because of &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;″s high affinity for horizontal gene transfer, antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea is seen as an emerging public health threat.

Prior to 2007, fluoroquinolones were a common treatment recommendation for gonorrhoeae. The CDC stopped suggesting these systemic bacterial agents once a resistant strain of &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; emerged in the United States. The removal of fluoroquinolones as a potential treatment left cephalosporins as the only viable antimicrobial option for gonorrhea treatment. Wary of further gonococcal resistance, the CDC&#x27;s recommendations shifted in 2010 to a dual therapy strategy—cephalosporin with either azithromycin or doxycycline. Despite these efforts, resistant &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; had been reported in five continents by 2011, further limiting treatment options and recommendations. Antimicrobial resistance is not universal and &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; strains in the United States continue to respond to a combination regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

=== Serum resistance ===
As a Gram negative bacterium, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; requires defense mechanisms to protect itself against the complement system (or complement cascade), whose components are found with human serum. There are three different pathways that activate this system however, they all result in the activation of complement protein 3 (C3). A cleaved portion of this protein, C3b, is deposited on pathogenic surfaces and results in opsonization as well as the downstream activation of the membrane attack complex. &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; has several mechanisms to avoid this action. As a whole, these mechanisms are referred to as serum resistance.

== History ==

=== Name origin ===
&quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; is named for Albert Neisser, who isolated it as the causative agent of the disease gonorrhea in 1878. Galen (130 AD) coined the term &quot;gonorrhea&quot; from the Greek &quot;gonos&quot; which means &quot;seed&quot; and &quot;rhoe&quot; which means &quot;flow&quot;. Thus, gonorrhea means &quot;flow of seed&quot;, a description referring to the white penile discharge, assumed to be semen, seen in male infection.

=== Discovery ===
In 1878, Albert Neisser isolated and visualized &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; diplococci in samples of pus from 35 men and women with the classic symptoms of genitourinary infection with gonorrhea – two of whom also had infections of the eyes. In 1882, Leistikow and Loeffler were able to grow the organism in culture. Then in 1883, Max Bockhart proved conclusively that the bacterium isolated by Albert Neisser was the causative agent of the disease known as gonorrhea by inoculating the penis of a healthy man with the bacteria. The man developed the classic symptoms of gonorrhea days after, satisfying the last of Koch&#x27;s postulates. Until this point, researchers debated whether syphilis and gonorrhea were manifestations of the same disease or two distinct entities. One such 18th-century researcher, John Hunter, tried to settle the debate in 1767 by inoculating a man with pus taken from a patient with gonorrhea. He erroneously concluded that syphilis and gonorrhea were indeed the same disease when the man developed the copper-colored rash that is classic for syphilis. Although many sources repeat that Hunter inoculated himself, others have argued that it was in fact another man. After Hunter&#x27;s experiment other scientists sought to disprove his conclusions by inoculating other male physicians, medical students, and incarcerated men with gonorrheal pus, who all developed the burning and discharge of gonorrhea. One researcher, Ricord, took the initiative to perform 667 inoculations of gonorrheal pus on patients of a mental hospital, with zero cases of syphilis. Notably, the advent of penicillin in the 1940s made effective treatments for gonorrhea available.

<text>Rohinton Mistry (born 1952) is an Indian-born Canadian writer. He has been the recipient of many awards including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 2012. Each of his first three novels was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. His novels to date have been set in India, told from the perspective of Parsis, and explore themes of family life, poverty, discrimination, and the corrupting influence of society.

==Early life and education==
Rohinton Mistry was born in Bombay, India, to a Parsi family. His brother is the playwright and author Cyrus Mistry. He earned a BA in Mathematics and Economics from St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Bombay.

He emigrated to Canada with his wife-to-be Freny Elavia in 1975 and they married shortly afterwards. He worked in a bank for a while, before returning to academia at the University of Toronto where he obtained a BA in English and Philosophy. 

==Career==

While attending the University of Toronto (Woodsworth College) he became the first to win two Hart House literary prizes for stories published in the &quot;Hart House Review&quot;, and &quot;Canadian Fiction Magazine&quot;″s annual Contributor&#x27;s Prize for 1985.

Three years later, Penguin Books Canada published his collection of 11 short stories, &quot;Tales from Firozsha Baag&quot;. It was later published in the United States as &quot;Swimming Lessons and Other Stories from Firozsha Baag&quot;. The book consists of 11 stories set within an apartment complex in modern-day Bombay. This volume contains the oft-anthologized story, &quot;Swimming Lessons&quot;.

His second book, the novel &quot;Such a Long Journey&quot;, was published in 1991. It won the Governor General&#x27;s Award, the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best Book, and the W.H. Smith/Books in Canada First Novel Award. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and for the Trillium Award. It has been translated into German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Japanese. It was adapted for the 1998 film &quot;Such a Long Journey&quot;. The content of the book caused controversy at Mumbai University in 2010 due to language used against Bal Thackeray, leader of Shiv Sena, a political party from Maharashtra, as well as some remarks about Maharashtrians. The book was prescribed for the second year Bachelor of Arts (English) in 2007–08 as an optional text, according to University sources. Later, Dr. Rajan Welukar, University of Mumbai&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor (V-C) used emergency powers in the Maharashtra Universities Act, 1994, to withdraw the book from the syllabus.

His third book, and second novel, &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; (1995), won the second annual Giller Prize in 1995, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize for Fiction in 1996. It was selected for Oprah&#x27;s Book Club in November 2001. It won the 1996 Commonwealth Writers Prize and was shortlisted for the 1996 Booker Prize.

&quot;Family Matters&quot; (2002) is a consideration of the difficulties that come with ageing, to which topic Mistry returned in 2008 with the short fiction &quot;The Scream&quot; (published as a separate volume, in support of World Literacy of Canada, with illustrations by Tony Urquhart). Mistry&#x27;s literary papers are housed at the Clara Thomas Archives at York University.

In 2002, Mistry cancelled his United States book tour for his novel &quot;Family Matters&quot; after he and his wife were targeted by security agents at every airport.

<doc id="61839" wikidata="Q1139583" url="?curid=61839" title="Inner automorphism">
<text>In abstract algebra, an inner automorphism is an automorphism of a group, ring, or algebra given by the conjugation action of a fixed element, called the &quot;conjugating element&quot;. They can be realized via operations from within the group itself, hence the adjective &quot;inner&quot;. These inner automorphisms form a subgroup of the automorphism group, and the quotient of the automorphism group by this subgroup is defined as the outer automorphism group.

==Definition==

If is a group and is an element of (alternatively, if is a ring, and is a unit), then the function

:formula_1

is called (right) conjugation by (see also conjugacy class). This function is an endomorphism of : for all formula_2

:formula_3

where the second equality is given by the insertion of the identity between formula_4 and formula_5 Furthermore, it has a left and right inverse, namely formula_6 Thus, formula_7 is both an monomorphism and epimorphism, and so an isomorphism of with itself, i.e. an automorphism. An inner automorphism is any automorphism that arises from conjugation. 

When discussing right conjugation, the expression formula_8 is often denoted exponentially by formula_9 This notation is used because composition of conjugations satisfies the identity: formula_10 for all formula_11 This shows that right conjugation gives a right action of on itself.

A common example is as follows: 

Describe a homomorphism formula_12 for which the image, formula_13, is a normal subgroup of inner automorphisms of a group formula_14; alternatively, describe a natural homomorphism of which the kernel of formula_12 is the center of formula_14 (all formula_17 for which conjugating by them returns the trivial automorphism), in other words, formula_18. There is always a natural homomorphism formula_19, which associates to every formula_17 an (inner) automorphism formula_21 in formula_22. Put identically, formula_23.

Let formula_24 as defined above. This requires demonstrating that (1) formula_21 is a homomorphism, (2) formula_21 is also a bijection, (3) formula_12 is a homomorphism. 

# formula_28
# The condition for bijectivity may be verified by simply presenting an inverse such that we can return to formula_29 from formula_30. In this case it is conjugation by formula_31denoted as formula_32. 
# formula_33 and formula_34

==Inner and outer automorphism groups==
The composition of two inner automorphisms is again an inner automorphism, and with this operation, the collection of all inner automorphisms of is a group, the inner automorphism group of denoted .

 is a normal subgroup of the full automorphism group of . The outer automorphism group, is the quotient group
:formula_35

The outer automorphism group measures, in a sense, how many automorphisms of are not inner. Every non-inner automorphism yields a non-trivial element of , but different non-inner automorphisms may yield the same element of .

Saying that conjugation of by leaves unchanged is equivalent to saying that and commute:
:formula_36

Therefore the existence and number of inner automorphisms that are not the identity mapping is a kind of measure of the failure of the commutative law in the group (or ring).

An automorphism of a group is inner if and only if it extends to every group containing .

By associating the element with the inner automorphism in as above, one obtains an isomorphism between the quotient group (where is the center of ) and the inner automorphism group:
:formula_37

This is a consequence of the first isomorphism theorem, because is precisely the set of those elements of that give the identity mapping as corresponding inner automorphism (conjugation changes nothing).

===Non-inner automorphisms of finite -groups===
A result of Wolfgang Gaschütz says that if is a finite non-abelian -group, then has an automorphism of -power order which is not inner.

It is an open problem whether every non-abelian -group has an automorphism of order . The latter question has positive answer whenever has one of the following conditions:
# is nilpotent of class 2
# is a regular -group
# is a powerful -group
# The centralizer in , , of the center, , of the Frattini subgroup, , of , , is not equal to 

===Types of groups===
The inner automorphism group of a group , , is trivial (i.e., consists only of the identity element) if and only if is abelian.

The group is cyclic only when it is trivial.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, the inner automorphisms may exhaust the entire automorphism group; a group whose automorphisms are all inner and whose center is trivial is called complete. This is the case for all of the symmetric groups on elements when is not 2 or 6. When , the symmetric group has a unique non-trivial class of non-inner automorphisms, and when , the symmetric group, despite having no non-inner automorphisms, is abelian, giving a non-trivial center, disqualifying it from being complete.

If the inner automorphism group of a perfect group is simple, then is called quasisimple.

==Lie algebra case==
An automorphism of a Lie algebra is called an inner automorphism if it is of the form , where is the adjoint map and is an element of a Lie group whose Lie algebra is . The notion of inner automorphism for Lie algebras is compatible with the notion for groups in the sense that an inner automorphism of a Lie group induces a unique inner automorphism of the corresponding Lie algebra.

==Extension==
If is the group of units of a ring, , then an inner automorphism on can be extended to a mapping on the projective line over by the group of units of the matrix ring, . In particular, the inner automorphisms of the classical groups can be extended in that way.

<text>Timothy Irving Frederick Findley (October 30, 1930 – June 20, 2002) was a Canadian novelist and playwright. He was also informally known by the nickname Tiff or Tiffy, an acronym of his initials.

==Biography==
===Early life===
One of three sons, Findley was born in Toronto, Ontario, to Allan Gilmour Findley, a stockbroker, and his wife, the former Margaret Maude Bull. His paternal grandfather was president of Massey-Harris, the farm-machinery company. He was raised in the upper class Rosedale district of the city, attending boarding school at St. Andrew&#x27;s College (although leaving during grade 10 for health reasons). He pursued a career in the arts, studying dance and acting, and had significant success as an actor before turning to writing. He was part of the original Stratford Festival company in the 1950s, acting alongside Alec Guinness, and appeared in the first production of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival. He also played Peter Pupkin in &quot;Sunshine Sketches&quot;, the CBC Television adaptation of Stephen Leacock&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot;.

===Career===
Though Findley had declared his homosexuality as a teenager, he married actress/photographer Janet Reid in 1959. The union lasted only three months and was dissolved by divorce or annulment two years later. He eventually became the domestic partner of writer Bill Whitehead, whom he met in 1962. Findley and Whitehead also collaborated on several documentary projects in the 1970s, including the television miniseries &quot;The National Dream&quot; and &quot;Dieppe 1942&quot;. Whitehead and Findley won the ACTRA Award for Best Writing in a Television Documentary at the 4th ACTRA Awards in 1975 for &quot;The National Dream&quot;.

Through Wilder, Findley became a close friend of actress Ruth Gordon, whose work as a screenwriter and playwright inspired Findley to consider writing as well. After Findley published his first short story in the &quot;Tamarack Review&quot;, Gordon encouraged him to pursue writing more actively, and he eventually left acting in the 1960s.

Findley&#x27;s first two novels, &quot;The Last of the Crazy People&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Butterfly Plague&quot; (1969), were originally published in Britain and the United States after having been rejected by Canadian publishers. Findley&#x27;s third novel, &quot;The Wars&quot;, was published to great acclaim in 1977 and went on to win the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language fiction. Director Robin Phillips subsequently adapted the novel into the 1983 theatrical film &quot;The Wars&quot;.

Findley received a Governor General&#x27;s Award, the Canadian Authors Association Award, an ACTRA Award, the Order of Ontario, the Trillium Book Award, and in 1985 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was a founding member and chair of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada, and a president of the Canadian chapter of PEN International.

His writing was typical of the Southern Ontario Gothic style – Findley, in fact, first invented its name — and was heavily influenced by Jungian psychology. Mental illness, gender and sexuality were frequent recurring themes in his work. Many of his novels centred on a protagonist who was struggling to find the moral and ethical and rational course of action in a situation that had spun wildly out of control. His characters often carried dark personal secrets, and were often conflicted – sometimes to the point of psychosis — by these burdens.

He publicly mentioned his homosexuality, passingly and perhaps for the first time, on a broadcast of the programme &quot;The Shulman File&quot; in the 1970s, taking host Morton Shulman completely by surprise.

Findley and Whitehead resided at Stone Orchard, a farm near Cannington, Ontario, and in the south of France. In 1996, Findley was honoured by the French government, who declared him a Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des arts et des lettres.

Findley was also the author of several dramas for television and stage. &quot;Elizabeth Rex&quot;, his most successful play, premiered at the Stratford Festival to rave reviews and won a Governor General&#x27;s award. His 1993 play &quot;The Stillborn Lover&quot; was adapted by Shaftesbury Films into the television film &quot;External Affairs&quot;, which aired on CBC Television in 1999. &quot;Shadows&quot;, first performed in 2001, was his last completed work. Findley was also an active mentor to a number of young Canadian writers, including Marnie Woodrow and Elizabeth Ruth.

In the final years of Findley&#x27;s life, declining health led him to move his Canadian residence to Stratford, Ontario, and Stone Orchard was purchased by Canadian dancer Rex Harrington.

In 2002, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

===Death===
Findley died on June 20, 2002, in Brignoles, France, not far from his house in Cotignac. &quot;Tiff: A Life of Timothy Findley&quot;, a biography by Sherrill Grace, was published in 2020.

Findley and the development of his theatrical play &quot;The Stillborn Lover&quot; were profiled by Terence Macartney-Filgate in the 1992 documentary film &quot;Timothy Findley: Anatomy of a Writer&quot;.

==Quotations==
* &quot;When we have stopped killing animals as though they were so much refuse, we will stop killing one another. But the highways show our indifference to death, so long as it is someone else&#x27;s. It is an attitude of the human mind I do not grasp. I have no point of connection with it. People drive in such a way that you think they do not believe in death. Their own lives are their business, but my life is not their business. I cannot refrain from terrific anger when I am threatened so casually by strangers on a public road.&quot; – from 1965 journal, at p. 16 of &quot;&quot;.
* &quot;A myth is not a lie, as such, but only the truth in size twelve shoes. Its gestures are wider—its voice is projected farther—its face has bolder features than reality would dare contrive.&quot; – from 1992 speech, reproduced at p. 75 of &quot;Journeyman: Travels of a Writer&quot;.

<text>Carol Ann Shields (née Warner; June 2, 1935 – July 16, 2003) was an American-born Canadian novelist and short story writer. She is best known for her 1993 novel &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot;, which won the U.S. Pulitzer Prize for Fiction as well as the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Canada.

==Early life and education==

Shields was born Carol Ann Warner in Oak Park, Illinois. She studied at Hanover College, in Indiana, where she received a BA in English in 1957, and became a member of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority. A United Nations scholarship encouraged Shields to spend a junior year abroad 1955–1956 at the University of Exeter in England. Shields did post-graduate work at the University of Ottawa, where she received an MA in 1975.

In 1955, while on British Council sponsored study week in Scotland, she met a Canadian engineering student, Donald Hugh Shields. The couple married in 1957 and moved to Canada, where they had a son and four daughters. Shields later became a Canadian citizen.

==Career==
In 1973, Shields became editorial assistant for the journal &quot;Canadian Slavonic Papers&quot; while living in Ottawa 1968–1978. Her first novel, &quot;Small Ceremonies&quot;, was published in 1976, followed by &quot;The Box Garden&quot; in 1977. That year she worked as a sessional lecturer in the English Department at the University of Ottawa. She taught Creative Writing at the University of British Columbia while living in Vancouver from 1978 to 1980.

Shields&#x27; third novel, &quot;Happenstance&quot;, was published in 1980; that year, she and her husband settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba, after he was hired to teach in the University of Manitoba&#x27;s Faculty of Engineering. It was here that Shields wrote her better-known books.

From the fall of 1982 onward, Shields taught in the English Department at the University of Manitoba, first as an Assistant Professor (1982–1992), then as an Associate Professor (1992–1995). She published the novel in 1987, and &quot;The Republic of Love&quot; in 1992. &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; (1993) won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 1993 Governor General&#x27;s Award, the only book to have ever received both awards. It won the U.S. National Book Critics Circle Award in 1994, and was nominated in 1993 for the Booker Prize. The Stone Diaries was named one of the best books of the year by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. It was also chosen as a &quot;Notable Book&quot; by &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, which wrote &quot;The Stone Diaries reminds us again why literature matters.&quot;

Shields was made Full Professor of English in 1995, and, in 1996, she became chancellor of the University of Winnipeg.

Shields was the author of several short story collections, including &quot;Various Miracles&quot; (1985), &quot;The Orange Fish&quot; (1989), and &quot;Dressing Up for the Carnival&quot; (2000). She was the recipient of a Canada Council Major Award, two National Magazine Awards, the 1990 Marian Engel Award, the Canadian Authors Award, and a CBC short story award. She was appointed as an officer of the Order of Canada in 1998 and was elevated to companion of the Order in 2002. Shields was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a member of the Order of Manitoba.

Carol Shields won the 1998 Orange Prize for Fiction for her 1997 novel &quot;Larry&#x27;s Party&quot;. Her last novel, &quot;Unless&quot; (2002), was nominated for the 2002 Giller Prize, the Governor General of Canada Literary Award, the Booker Prize and the 2003 Orange Prize for Fiction. It was awarded the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize.
On retirement in 2000, Shields became Professor Emerita at the University of Manitoba. That year, after Don&#x27;s retirement, the couple moved to Victoria, British Columbia.

Shields also studied the works of Jane Austen. She wrote the biography entitled &quot;Jane Austen&quot;, which won the $25,000 Charles Taylor Prize for literary non-fiction in April 2002, an award accepted by her daughter Meg on her behalf in Toronto, on April 22, 2002.

Her last novel, &quot;Unless&quot;, contains a passionate defense of female writers who write of &#x27;domestic&#x27; subjects.

Carol Shields wrote plays including &quot;Departures and Arrivals&quot; which has been performed hundreds of times by both amateur and professional theaters. Other celebrated plays include &quot;Thirteen Hand&quot; (1993), &quot;Fashion, Power, Guilt, and the Charity of Families&quot; (co-authored with daughter Catherine Shields)(1995), and &quot;Unless&quot; (with daughter Sara Cassidy) (2005). Collections of poems by Shields were published in 1972 &quot;Others&quot;, 1974 &quot;Intersect&quot;, and 1992 &quot;Coming to Canada&quot;.

Two collections of essays written by women about what they were not told became best sellers in Canada. &quot;Dropped Threads&quot; (2001) and &quot;Dropped Threads 2&quot; (2003) were edited by Shields and her friend and colleague Marjorie Anderson.

==Death and legacy==
Shields died in 2003 of breast cancer at age 68 in Victoria.

Following her death, six of her short stories were adapted by Shaftesbury Films into the dramatic anthology series &quot;The Shields Stories&quot;. Her earlier short story collections were republished as &quot;Collected Stories of Carol Shields&quot; in 2005. Films based on Carol Shields&#x27;s novels include &quot;Swann&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Republic of Love&quot; (2003). Her final novel, &quot;Unless&quot;, was adapted as a play in 2016 by Alan Gilsenan.

Shields&#x27; eldest daughter, Anne Giardini, is also a writer. Giardini has contributed to the &quot;National Post&quot; as a columnist, and has published her first novel, &quot;The Sad Truth About Happiness&quot;. Anne&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Advice for Italian Boys&quot;, was published in 2009. Giardini and her son, Nicholas, edited a book of Shields&#x27; thoughts and advice on writing, &quot;Startle and Illuminate&quot;, published in 2016.

Shields&#x27; youngest daughter, Sara Cassidy, has published many children&#x27;s books and young adult novels, including &quot;Slick&quot; (2010), &quot;Windfall&quot; (2011), A Boy Named Queen (2016), and Nevers (2019), which was nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for young people&#x27;s literature.

In 2020, the Carol Shields Prize for Fiction was announced as a new literary award to honor writing by Canadian and American women and non-binary authors.

In 2022, Shields was posthumously inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame for her contributions as an author.

<doc id="61843" wikidata="Q393686" url="?curid=61843" title="Academy Award for Best Visual Effects">
<text>The Academy Award for Best Visual Effects is presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the best achievement in visual effects. It has been handed to four members of the team directly responsible for creating the film&#x27;s visual effects since 1980.

==History==
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences first recognized the technical contributions of special effects to movies at its inaugural dinner in 1929, presenting a plaque for &quot;Best Engineering Effects&quot; to the first Best Picture Oscar winner, the World War I flying drama &quot;Wings&quot;.

Producer David O. Selznick, then production head at RKO Studios, petitioned the Academy Board of Governors to recognize the work of animator Willis O&#x27;Brien for his groundbreaking work on 1933&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot;. However, the Academy did not have a category to acknowledge its visual achievements at the time.

It was not until 1938 when a film was actually recognized for its effects work, when a &quot;Special Achievement Award for Special Effects&quot; was given to the Paramount film &quot;Spawn of the North&quot;. The following year, &quot;Best Special Effects&quot; became a recognized category, although on occasion the Academy has chosen to honor a single film outright rather than nominate two or more films. From 1939 to 1963, it was an award for a film&#x27;s visual effects as well as audio effects, so it was often given to two persons, although some years only one or the other type of effect was recognized. For the 22nd Academy Awards, RKO was nominated for the work done on &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949), and when they won, it was Willis H. O&#x27;Brien who went on stage to accept the statue. In 1964, it was given only for visual effects, and the following year the name of the category was changed to &quot;Best Special Visual Effects&quot;.

Honorees for this award have been bestowed several times as a Special Achievement Academy Award. In 1977, the category was given its current name &quot;Best Visual Effects.&quot; For decades, shortlisted finalists were selected by a steering committee. They are presently chosen by the visual effects branch executive committee. 1990 was the last year there were no official nominees. &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot; advanced to a second stage of voting, but only &quot;Total Recall&quot; received a requisite average and it was given a special achievement Oscar.

There have been three wholly animated films nominated in this category: &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; in 1993, &quot;Kubo and the Two Strings&quot; in 2016, and &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 2019. There have been three semi-animated films nominated, which also won: &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; in 1964, &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; in 1971, and &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; in 1988. In 2024, &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot; became the first non-English-language film ever to win in the category.

==Rules==
In 1979, there were five films nominated. For most of the next three decades, there were three nominees a year, although at some times there were two and at others, a single film was given the award outright.

In 2007, it was decided that a list of no more than 15 eligible films would be chosen, from which a maximum of seven would be shortlisted for further consideration. A vote would then proceed, with a maximum of three nominees. Since 2010, there are ten shortlisted finalists which, using a form of range voting, produce five nominees. No more than four people may be nominated for a single film.

According to the official Academy Award rules, the criteria are:

(a) consideration of the contribution the visual effects make to the overall production and
(b) the artistry, skill and fidelity with which the visual illusions are achieved.

==Filmmakers==
A number of filmmakers have had their movies honored for their achievements in visual effects; i.e., six by director James Cameron (who began his career in Hollywood as an effects technician), five films produced by George Pal, five by director/producer George Lucas, four by directors Richard Fleischer, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, three by directors Robert Zemeckis and Christopher Nolan, and two by directors Clarence Brown, Cecil B. DeMille, Mark Robson, Ridley Scott, Robert Stevenson and Denis Villeneuve.

Only two directors have won in the same category: Four time Best Director nominee Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s only Oscar win for 1968&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, and Japanese filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki&#x27;s first Oscar win for 2023&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;. The credits for &quot;2001&quot; list four effects contributors, including Douglas Trumbull. However, according to the rules of the Academy in effect at the time, only three persons could be nominated for their work on a single film, which would have resulted in the omission of either Trumbull, Tom Howard, Con Pederson or Wally Veevers. Ultimately, it was Kubrick&#x27;s name that was submitted as a nominee in this category, resulting in his winning the award, which many consider a slight to the four men whose work contributed to the film&#x27;s success.

==Shortlisted finalists==
Finalists for Best Visual Effects are selected by the Visual Effects Branch Executive Committee. Beginning with a long list of up to 20 titles, the committee then advances ten films to the shortlist. Prior to the 83rd Academy Awards, only fifteen films were long-listed, and only seven films were shortlisted. The full membership of the Visual Effects Branch is invited to view excerpts and is provided with supporting information at a &quot;bake-off&quot; where balloting determines the five nominees. These are the additional films that presented at the bake-off.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay is the Academy Award for the best screenplay adapted from previously established material. The most frequently adapted media are novels, but other adapted narrative formats include stage plays, musicals, short stories, TV series, and other films and film characters. All sequels are also considered adaptations by this standard, being based on the story and characters of the original film.

Prior to its current name, the award was known as the Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based On Material From Another Medium. The Best Adapted Screenplay category has been a part of the Academy Awards since their inception.

==Superlatives==
The first person to win twice in this category was Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who won the award in two consecutive years, 1949 and 1950. Others to win twice in this category include George Seaton, Robert Bolt (who also won in consecutive years), Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo, Alvin Sargent, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Michael Wilson, Alexander Payne and Christopher Hampton. Payne won both awards as part of a writing team, with Jim Taylor for &quot;Sideways&quot; and Jim Rash and Nat Faxon for &quot;The Descendants&quot;. Michael Wilson was blacklisted at the time of his second Oscar, so the award was given to a front (novelist Pierre Boulle). However, the Academy officially recognized him as the winner several years later.

Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, Paddy Chayefsky, Francis Ford Coppola, Horton Foote, William Goldman, Robert Benton, Bo Goldman, Waldo Salt, and the Coen brothers have won Oscars for both original and adapted screenplays.

Frances Marion (&quot;The Big House&quot;) was the first woman to win in any screenplay category, although she won for her original script for Best Writing, which then included both original and adapted screenplays before a separate award for Best Original Screenplay was introduced. Sarah Y. Mason (&quot;Little Women&quot;) was the first woman to win for adaptation from previously established material; she shared the award with her husband, Victor Heerman. They are also the first of two married couples to win in this category; Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh (&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;) are the others.

Pierre Collings and Sheridan Gibney (&quot;The Story of Louis Pasteur&quot;) were the first to win for adapting their own work.

Philip G. Epstein and Julius J. Epstein (&quot;Casablanca&quot;) are the first siblings to win in this category. James Goldman (&quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;) and William Goldman (&quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;) are the first siblings to win for separate films. Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (&quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;) are the third winning siblings.

Mario Puzo is the one of two writers whose work has been adapted and resulted in two wins. Puzo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Godfather&quot; resulted in wins in 1972 and 1974 for himself and Francis Ford Coppola. The other is E. M. Forster, whose novels &quot;A Room with a View&quot; and &quot;Howards End&quot; resulted in wins for Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.

Larry McMurtry is the only person who has won for adapting someone else&#x27;s work (&quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;), and whose own work has been adapted by someone else, resulting in a win (&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;.

William Monahan (&quot;The Departed&quot; and Sian Heder (&quot;CODA&quot;) are the only people who have won this award by using another full-length feature film as the credited source of the adaptation.

Geoffrey S. Fletcher (&quot;Precious&quot;), John Ridley (&quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;) and Cord Jefferson (&quot;American Fiction&quot;) are the only African-Americans to win solo in this category; Fletcher is also the first African-American to win in any writing category. Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney (&quot;Moonlight&quot; are the first African-American writing duo to win; Spike Lee and Kevin Willmott (&quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;) are the second, although their co-writers, David Rabinowitz and Charlie Wachtel, are both white.

James Ivory (&quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot;) is the oldest person to receive the award at age 89. Charlie Wachtel (&quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;) is the youngest at age 32.

Taika Waititi (&quot;Jojo Rabbit&quot; is the first person of Māori descent to receive the award.

Emma Thompson (&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;) is the only winner who has also won for acting. Winners Billy Bob Thornton (&quot;Sling Blade&quot;) and John Huston (&quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;) have been nominated for acting but not won.

Charles Schnee (&quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;, Billy Bob Thornton (&quot;Sling Blade&quot;), and Bill Condon (&quot;Gods and Monsters&quot;) are the only winners whose respective films were not nominated for Best Picture.

==Notable nominees==
Noted novelists and playwrights nominated in this category include: George Bernard Shaw (who shared an award for an adaptation of his play &quot;Pygmalion&quot;), Graham Greene, Tennessee Williams, Vladimir Nabokov, James Hilton, Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Lillian Hellman, Irwin Shaw, James Agee, Norman Corwin, S. J. Perelman, Terence Rattigan, John Osborne, Robert Bolt, Harold Pinter, David Mamet, Larry McMurtry, Arthur Miller, John Irving, David Hare, Tony Kushner, August Wilson, Florian Zeller and Kazuo Ishiguro.

Ted Elliott, Roger S. H. Schulman, Joe Stillman &amp; Terry Rossio, writers of &quot;Shrek&quot; and Michael Arndt, John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton &amp; Lee Unkrich, writers of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, are as of 2020, the only writers to be nominated for an animated film.

Scott Frank, James Mangold and Michael Green, writers of &quot;Logan&quot;, are the first writers to be nominated for a film based on superhero comic books (the X-Men).

<text>Dorking () is a market town in Surrey in South East England about south of London. It is in Mole Valley District and the council headquarters are to the east of the centre. The High Street runs roughly east–west, parallel to the Pipp Brook and along the northern face of an outcrop of Lower Greensand. The town is surrounded on three sides by the Surrey Hills National Landscape and is close to Box Hill and Leith Hill.

The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity is from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, and there are several Bronze Age bowl barrows in the local area. The town may have been the site of a staging post on Stane Street during Roman times, however the name &#x27;Dorking&#x27; suggests an Anglo-Saxon origin for the modern settlement. A market is thought to have been held at least weekly since early medieval times and was highly regarded for the poultry traded there. The Dorking breed of domestic chicken is named after the town.

The local economy thrived during Tudor times, but declined in the 17th century due to poor infrastructure and competition from neighbouring towns. During the early modern period many inhabitants were nonconformists, including the author, Daniel Defoe, who lived in Dorking as a child. Six of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims, including William Mullins and his daughter Priscilla, lived in the town before setting sail for the New World.

Dorking started to expand during the 18th and 19th centuries as transport links improved and farmland to the south of the centre was released for housebuilding. The new turnpike, and later the railways, facilitated the sale of lime produced in the town, but also attracted wealthier residents, who had had no previous connection to the area. Residential expansion continued in the first half of the 20th century, as the Deepdene and Denbies estates began to be broken up. Further development is now constrained by the Metropolitan Green Belt, which encircles the town.

==Toponymy==
The origins and meaning of the name Dorking are uncertain. Early spellings include &quot;Dorchinges&quot; (1086), &quot;Doreking&quot; (1138–47), &quot;Dorkinges&quot; (1180), and &quot;Dorkingg&quot; (1219). Both principal elements in the name are disputed. The first element may be from a personal name, &quot;Deorc&quot;, or some variant, of either Brittonic or Old English origin. Alternatively it may derive from the Brittonic words &quot;Dorce&quot;, a river name meaning &quot;clear, bright stream&quot;, or &quot;duro&quot;, meaning a &quot;fort&quot;, &quot;walled town&quot; or &quot;gated place&quot;. The second element, if originally plural (&quot;ingas&quot;), might mean &quot;(settlement belonging to the) followers of ...&quot;, but if singular (&quot;ing&quot;) might mean &quot;place&quot;, &quot;stream&quot;, &quot;wood&quot; or &quot;clump&quot;.

==Geography==
===Location and topography===

Dorking is in central Surrey, about south of London and east of Guildford. It is close to the intersection of two valleys – the north-south Mole Gap (where the River Mole cuts through the North Downs) and the west–east Vale of Holmesdale (a narrow strip of low-lying land between the North Downs and the Greensand Ridge). The highest point in the town is the Glory Wood, south east of the centre, where the summit () is marked by a Bronze Age bowl barrow.

The basic plan of the town centre has not changed since medieval times (and may be Anglo-Saxon in origin). The main streets (the High Street, West Street and South Street) meet at Pump Corner, forming a &quot; Y &quot; shape. Together, West Street and the High Street run approximately west–east, paralleling the Pipp Brook, a tributary of the Mole, which runs to the north of the centre.

The town is surrounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt (which also covers the Glory Wood) and is bordered on three sides by the Surrey Hills National Landscape. Several Sites of Special Scientific Interest are close by, including the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment, immediately to the north. The National Trust owns several properties in the area, including Box Hill, Leith Hill Tower and Polesden Lacey.

===Geology===
The rock strata on which Dorking sits, belong primarily to the Lower Greensand Group. This group is multilayered and includes the sandy Hythe Beds, the clayey Sandgate Beds and the quartz-rich Folkestone Beds. The lower greensand was deposited in the early Cretaceous, most likely in a shallow sea with low oxygen levels. Over the subsequent 50 million years, other strata were deposited on top of the Lower Greensand, including Gault clay, Upper Greensand and the chalk of the North and South Downs.

Following the Cretaceous, the sea covering the south of England began to retreat and the land was pushed higher. The Weald (the area covering modern-day south Surrey, south Kent, north Sussex and east Hampshire) was lifted by the same geological processes that created the Alps, resulting in an anticline which stretched across the English Channel to the Artois region of northern France. Initially an island, this dome-like structure was drained by the ancestors of the rivers which today cut through the North and South Downs, including the Mole. The dome was eroded away over the course of the Cenozoic, exposing the strata beneath and resulting in the escarpments of the Downs and the Greensand Ridge.

In Dorking, the dividing line between the Lower Greensand and Gault clay is marked by the course of the Pipp Brook. In the south of the town, the Hythe Beds take the form of iron-rich, soft, fine-grained sandstone, whereas the Sandgate Beds have a more loamy composition. The quartz-rich Folkestone Beds have a lower iron content, and contain veins of silver sand and rose-coloured ferruginous sand. Running along the north bank of the Pipp Brook (with a width of around ) is the outcrop of Gault, a blue-black shaly clay, beyond which is a narrow band of Upper Greensand, a hard, grey mica-rich sandstone. In the extreme north west of the town, the marly Lower Chalk was quarried for lime production until the early 20th century.

Ammonite fossils are found in the north of the town, including &quot;Stoliczkia&quot;, &quot;Callihoplites&quot;, &quot;Acanthoceras&quot; and &quot;Euomphaloceras&quot; species in the Lower Chalk and &quot;Puzosia&quot; species in the Upper Greensand. Foraminifera fossils have been found in the Hythe Beds adjacent to the Horsham road, to the west of Tower Hill.

==History and development==
===Pre-history===
The earliest evidence of human activity in Dorking comes from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods and includes flint tools and flakes found during construction development in South Street. During the rebuilding of the Waitrose supermarket in South Street in 2013, charred hazelnut shells, radiocarbon dated to between 8625 and 8465 BCE, were discovered. A ring ditch containing two ceramic urns, was also found. Other ditches identified during the same excavation may indicate the presence of a Bronze Age field system, although the date of these later earthworks is less certain. Bowl barrows from the same period have been found at the Glory Wood (to the south of the town centre), on Milton Heath (to the west) and on Box Hill (to the northeast).

===Roman and Saxon===
There is thought to have been a settlement at Dorking in Roman times, although its size and extent are unclear. Coins from the reigns of Hadrian (117–138 AD), Commodus (180–192) and Claudius Gothicus (214–270), as well as tiles and pottery fragments, have been found in the town. Stane Street, the Roman road linking London to Chichester, was constructed during the first century AD and is thought to have run through Dorking. The exact course through the town is not known and no definitive archaeological evidence has been discovered for the route in the gap between the crossing of the River Mole at the Burford Bridge and North Holmwood. A posting station is thought to have been located in the area and sites have been proposed in the town centre, at Pixham and at the Burford Bridge, where the road crossed the River Mole.

Although the name Dorking implies a settlement that was well established by the time of the Norman Conquest, archaeological evidence of Saxon activity in the town centre is limited to pottery sherds. Probable Saxon cemeteries have been found close to Yew Tree Road (to the north of the centre) and at Vincent Lane (to the west). In 1817, the so-called &quot;Dorking Hoard&quot; of around 700 silver pennies, dating from the mid-8th to the late-9th centuries, was found near the source of the Pipp Brook on the northern slopes of Leith Hill. In the late Saxon period, the manor and parish were administered as part of the Wotton Hundred and may have been part of a large royal estate centred on Leatherhead.

===Governance===
Dorking appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as the Manor of &quot;Dorchinges&quot;. It was held by William the Conqueror, who had assumed the lordship in 1075 on the death of Edith of Wessex, widow of Edward the Confessor. The settlement included one church, three mills worth 15s 4d, 16 ploughs, woodland and herbage for 88 hogs and of meadow. It rendered £18 per year in 1086. The residents included 38 villagers, 14 smallholders and 4 villeins, which placed it in the top 20% of settlements in England by population.

In around 1087, William II granted the manor of Dorking to Willam de Warenne, the first Earl of Surrey, whose descendants have held the lordship almost continuously until the present day. By the early 14th century, the manor had been divided for administrative purposes into four tithings: Eastburgh and Chippingburgh (corresponding respectively to the eastern and western halves of the modern town); Foreignburgh (the area covered by the Holmwoods) and Waldburgh (which would later be renamed Capel). On the death of the seventh Earl, John de Warenne, in 1347, the manor passed to his brother-in-law, Richard Fitzalan, the third Earl of Arundel. In 1580 both Earldoms passed through the female line to Phillip Howard, whose father, Thomas Howard, had forfeited the title of Duke of Norfolk and had been executed for his involvement in the Ridolfi plot to assassinate Elizabeth I. The dukedom was restored to the family in 1660, following the accession of Charles II.
As the status of the de Warennes and their descendants increased, they became less interested in the town. In the 14th and 15th centuries, prominent local families (including the Sondes and the Goodwyns) were able to buy the leases on some of the lordship lands. One such area was the Deepdene, first mentioned in a court roll of 1399. This woodland was held by several tenants, before being inherited in 1652 by Charles Howard, the fourth son of the 15th Earl of Arundel, in whose family it remained until 1790. The estate was expanded by successive owners, including the Anglo-Dutch banker Thomas Hope and his eldest son Henry Thomas Hope, who commissioned William Atkinson to remodel the main house as a &quot;sumptuous High Renaissance palazzo&quot;.

Unlike the neighbouring towns of Guildford and Reigate, Dorking was never granted a Borough Charter and remained under the control of the Lord of the Manor throughout the Middle Ages. Reforms during the Tudor period reduced the importance of manorial courts and the day-to-day administration of towns such as Dorking became the responsibility of the vestry of the parish church. There was little change in local government structure over the subsequent three centuries, until the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 transferred responsibility for poor relief to the Poor Law Commission, whose local powers were delegated to the newly formed poor law union in 1836. In 1841, the Dorking Union constructed a new workhouse, south of the town centre, designed by William Shearburn. The entrance block still stands and is now part of Dorking Hospital.

A local board of health (LBH) was established in Dorking in 1881 to administer infrastructure including roads, street lighting and drainage. The LBH organised the first regular domestic refuse collection and, by mid-1888, had created a new sewerage system (including a treatment works at Pixham). The Local Government Act 1888 transferred many administrative responsibilities to the newly formed Surrey County Council and was followed by an 1894 Act that created the Dorking Urban District Council (UDC). Initially the offices of the UDC were in South Street, but in 1931 the Council moved to Pippbrook House, a Gothic Revival country house to the north east of the town centre, designed as a private residence by George Gilbert Scott in 1856.

The Local Government Act 1972 created Mole Valley District Council (MVDC), by combining the UDCs of Dorking and Leatherhead with the majority of the Dorking and Horley Rural District. In 1984, the new council moved into purpose-built offices, designed by Michael Innes, at the east end of the town.

===Transport and communications===
Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, there appears to have been no systematic planning of transport infrastructure in the local area for over a millennium. During Saxon times, the section of Stane Street between Dorking and Ockley was bypassed by the longer route via Coldharbour and the upper surface of the Roman road was most likely quarried to provide stone for local building projects. Two routes linked the town to London, the first via the Mole crossing at Burford Bridge to Leatherhead and the second, the &quot;Winter Road&quot;, climbed the south-facing scarp slope of Box Hill from Boxhurst and ran northeastwards to meet the London-Brighton road at Tadworth.

The development of Guildford ( to the west) was stimulated by the construction of the Wey Navigation in the 1650s. In contrast, although several schemes were proposed to make the Mole navigable, none were enacted and transport links to Dorking remained poor. As a result, the local economy began to suffer and the town declined through the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

The turnpike road through Dorking was authorised by the Sussex and Surrey Roads Act 1755 (28 Geo. 2 c. 45). The new turnpike dramatically improved the accessibility of the town from the capital and a report from 1765 noted both that the Thursday grain market had increased in size and that the local flour mills were significantly busier. A mail coach operated return journeys between Dorking and London six days per week and several stagecoaches used the route daily until the mid-19th century. In contrast, the eastwest ReigateGuildford road remained the responsibility of the parishes through which it ran and only minimal improvements were made before the start of the 20th century.
The first railway line to reach Dorking was the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG&amp;RR), authorised by Acts of Parliament in 1846, 1847 and 1849. Dorking station (now ) was opened in 1849 northwest of the town, initially as a temporary terminus for trains from . Local residents had expressed a preference for the station to be sited closer to the town centre at Meadowbank, but since the line passed through a deep cutting at this point it was deemed impractical to provide the necessary freight facilities at this location. Two years later a second station, now known as , was opened on the same line.

The second railway line to serve the town was authorised by Acts of Parliament in 1862 and 1864 and was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1867. A west-south connecting spur to the RG&amp;RR was provided on opening, but was removed around 1900, before being briefly restored between 1941 and 1946 as a wartime resilience measure.

 was provided with extensive goods facilities, a locomotive yard and a turntable (later the site of the car park). It was built with two platforms, but a third was added in 1925, when the railway line was electrified from . The original building was demolished in 1980 and was replaced by a larger structure, designed by Gordon Lavington, which integrated the station with offices for Biwater.

In the late 1920s, improvements were made to the Dorking-Reigate road (now the A25), including the construction of Deepdene Bridge over the River Mole. The bypass road (now the A24) was opened in 1934 following considerable local opposition to the route, which cut through the Deepdene estate.

===Commerce and industry===
A market at Dorking is first recorded in 1240 and in 1278, the sixth Earl of Surrey, John de Warenne, claimed that it had been held twice weekly since &quot;time out of mind&quot;. The early medieval market was probably centred around Pump Corner and between South Street and West Street, but it appears to have moved east to the widest part of the High Street by the early 15th century.
In the century following the Norman conquest, agricultural activity was focused on the lordship lands, which lay to the north of the Pipp Brook. However, as the Middle Ages progressed, woodland to the south and west of the centre was cleared enabling farms owned by the Goodwyns, Stubbs and Sondes families to expand. By the start of the Tudor period, there were at least five watermills in Dorking – two at Pixham (one on the Pipp Brook, owned by the Sondes and one on the Mole, owned by the Brownes), two close to the town centre (both owned by the manor) and one at Milton, on the road to Westcott. There may also have been a windmill on Tower Hill.
The town flourished in Tudor times and, in the 1590s, a market house was built between what is now St Martin&#x27;s Walk and the White Horse Hotel. The antiquarian John Aubrey, who visited the town between 1673 and 1692, noted that the weekly market (which took place on Thursdays) was &quot;the greatest... for poultry in England&quot; and noted that &quot;Sussex wheat&quot; was also sold. The free-draining Lower Greensand found in the Dorking area is particularly suited for rearing chickens and the local soils provide grit to assist the birds&#x27; digestive systems. The Dorking fowl, which has five claws instead of the normal four, is named after the town. 

Wine made from the wild cherries that grew in the town was another local speciality. A &#x27;cherry fair&#x27; was held in July in the 17th and 18th centuries, and was revived in the 20th century at St Barnabas Church, Ranmore. Aubrey also recorded that an annual fair took place on Ascension Day.

Chalk and sand were quarried in Dorking until the early 20th century. Chalk was dug from a pit on Ranmore Road and heated in kilns to produce quicklime. In the medieval and early modern periods, the lime was used to fertilise local farm fields, but from the 18th century onwards (and especially after the construction of the turnpike to Epsom in 1755), it was transported to London for use in the construction industry. Sand from the Folkestone Beds was quarried from several sites in the town, including at two pits in Vincent Lane.

Caves and tunnels were also dug in the sandstone under several parts of the town. Many were used as cellars for storing wine bottles, but deeper workings followed seams of silver sand, which was used in glass making. Most of the surviving caves are privately owned and not accessible to the public. A well-known example is the cockpit beneath the former Wheatsheaf Inn in the High Street, in which fighting cocks were set against each other for sport. During the construction of the car park to the south of Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, the builders broke through into a large cavern of unknown date, the walls of which were painted with &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; pillars. Unfortunately, in order to complete the car park, it was necessary to fill in the cave with concrete. Guided tours of the caves in South Street are held on a regular basis and are organised by Dorking Museum.

By the start of the 19th century, increasing mechanisation of agriculture was leading to a local surplus of labour. The wages for unskilled farm workers were decreasing, exacerbated by a fall in produce prices following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Like many towns in the south of England, Dorking was affected by civil unrest among its poorest residents. In November 1830 a riot broke out and a mob of 80 attacked the Red Lion Inn in the High Street. A troop of soldiers from the Life Guards regiment was called in to restore order. In 1831 it was noted that the town (population 4711) had one of the highest rates of poor relief in Surrey.

In early 1832, the vestry devised a supported scheme to enable young unemployed, unskilled labourers to leave the town to settle in Upper Canada. The cost of the voyage from Portsmouth to Montreal for 61 recipients of poor relief was paid by private donations, however the emigrants also received an allowance for food and clothing from parish funds. Although many were young, single men aged 14–20, a few families also joined the group. Most appear to have settled in the Toronto area, but a few are recorded as living in Kingston, Ontario.

In 1911, the town was described in the Victoria County History as &quot;almost entirely residential and agricultural, with some lime works on the chalk, though not so extensive as those in neighbouring parishes, a little brick-making, watermills (corn) at Pixham Mill, and timber and saw-mills.&quot;

===Residential development===

Although the turnpike road through Dorking had been constructed in the 1750s, the built-up part of the town had changed little by the start of the 19th century. Most of the local professional class and wealthier tradesmen lived along the three main streets (the High Street, West Street and South Street), whilst the often crowded houses of artisans and labourers tended to be in the narrower lanes and alleys. Poor sanitation was still a major problem for the poorer residents and, in 1832, a cholera outbreak was recorded in Ebenezer Place (north of the High Street), where 46 people were crammed into nine cottages.

Nevertheless, Dorking was beginning to attract more affluent residents, many of whom had accumulated their wealth as businessmen in London. Charles Barclay (a Southwark brewery owner) and the bankers Joseph Denison and Thomas Hope (none of whom had any previous connection with the area) purchased the estates at Bury Hill, Denbies and Deepdene respectively. Higher-status individuals living closer to the town centre included William Crawford, the City of London MP, and Jane Leslie, the Dowager Countess of Rothes. Although the incoming landowners played little part in local commerce, they appear to have been the driving force behind schemes to pave streets and to provide gas lighting (both paid for by public subscription).
Rose Hill, the first planned residential estate in Dorking, was developed by William Newland, a wealthy Guildford surgeon, who also had interests in the Wey and Arun Canal. Newland purchased the &quot;Great House&quot; on Butter Hill and the surrounding of land in 1831, which he divided into plots for 24 houses, arranged around a central paddock, known as &quot;The Oval&quot;. The Great House was divided into two separate dwellings (Butter Hill House and Rose Hill House), adjacent to which a mock-Tudor arch was erected over the main carriageway entrance from South Street. Initially sales were slow, but the proposals for the building of the railway line from Redhill stimulated interest in the development in the late 1840s. Although most of the purchasers were private individuals (the majority of whom had been born outside of the local area), the Dorking Society of Friends bought one of the plots in 1845 for the construction of a meeting house. By 1861 the estate was complete.

The arrival of the railway in 1849 catalysed the expansion of the town to the south and west. Between 1850 and 1870, the National Freehold Land Society was responsible for housing developments in Arundel and Howard Roads, as well as around Tower Hill. Poorer quality houses were built along Falkland and Hampstead Roads (many of which were replaced in the 1960s and 1970s). Holloway Farm was sold in 1870 and the first houses in Knoll, Roman and Ridgeway Roads were constructed before 1880. Houses in Cliftonville (named after its promoter, Joseph Clift, a local chemist) were also built around the same time. To the north of the High Street, smaller semi-detached and terraced houses were constructed in the 1890s for artisans in Rothes Road, Ansell Road, Wathen Road, Hart Road and Jubilee Terrace.

No significant residential expansion took place in Dorking in the first two decades of the 20th century. In the 1920s and 1930s, the breakup of the Deepdene and Pippbrook estates (and the electrification of the railway line from Leatherhead) stimulated housebuilding to the north and east of the town, including Deepdene Vale and Deepdene Park. The sale of part of Bradley Farm (part of the Denbies estate) in the 1930s, enabled the building of Ashcombe, Keppel and Calvert Roads. The Dorking UDC intended to build housing on the rest of the farm (now Denbies Wine Estate), however their plans were interrupted by the outbreak of war and were ultimately prevented by the creation of the Metropolitan Green Belt.
The first council housing was built in Dorking by the UDC in Nower Road in 1920 and similar developments took place in Marlborough and Beresford Roads later the same decade. In 1936, the council obtained a Slum Clearance Order to demolish 81 properties in Church Street, North Street, Cotmandene and the surrounding areas. In total 217 residents were displaced, many of whom were rehoused by the UDC in the Fraser Gardens estate, designed by the architect George Grey Wornum. The Chart Downs estate to the southeast of the town was built between 1948 and 1952.

Controversially, in the late 1950s and 1960s, Dorking UDC constructed the Goodwyns estate on land compulsorily purchased from Howard Martineau, a major local benefactor to the town. The initial designs were by Clifford Culpin and the project was subsequently developed by William Ryder, who was responsible for the erection of the Wenlock Edge and Linden Lea tower blocks. Both the design of the buildings and the layout of the estate were praised in the early 1970s by architectural historians Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner.

===Religion===

The first mention of a church at Dorking occurs in Domesday Book of 1086. In around 1140, Isabel de Warenne, the widow of the second Earl of Surrey, granted the church and a tithe of the rents from the manor to Lewes Priory in Sussex. In the 1190s, the tithe was converted to a pension of £6, which was paid annually to the Priory until at least 1291. The Priory also acquired the right to appoint the town&#x27;s priest.
It is unclear where in the town the Domesday church was located. It appears to have been replaced at some point during the 12th century (possibly by Isabel de Warenne) by a large cruciform building with a central tower. A rededication from St Mary to St Martin may have taken place around the same time. In 1334 the church was granted to the Priory of the Holy Cross in Reigate. In the late 14th century a clerestory and two side aisles were added to the nave.

The so-called Intermediate Church was constructed in 1835–1837. It had a square tower, topped with an octagonal spire, and could seat around 1800 worshippers. Its floor level was approximately higher than that of the church it replaced, allowing the base of the medieval nave to become a crypt. In 1868–1877, the Intermediate Church was rebuilt into the present St Martin&#x27;s Church, designed in the Decorated Gothic style by the architect Henry Woodyer. The spire of the current church was dedicated as a memorial to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce (who had died in 1873) and in 1905–1911 the Lady chapel was added.

In order to accommodate the growing population in the south of the town, a second Anglican church, St Paul&#x27;s, was opened in 1857 on land donated by Henry Thomas Hope. Designed by the architect, Benjamin Ferrey, it was built of Bath stone in the Decorated Geometric style. A daughter church to St Martin&#x27;s, designed by Edwin Lutyens and dedicated to St Mary, was opened at Pixham in 1903.

In the two centuries following the passing of the 1558 Act of Uniformity, many inhabitants of Dorking embraced more extreme forms of protestantism and by 1676, the parish (which had a total population of around 1500) contained 200 nonconformists. In 1620, six residents, including Williams Mullins (a cobbler) and his daughter Priscilla, joined the &quot;Mayflower&quot; to establish a Separatist colony in the New World. During the Civil War, the townsfolk supported the Parliamentarians, but although some of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers were billeted in Dorking, no fighting took place nearby.
Christopher Feake, the Fifth Monarchist and independent minister, lived in the town (allegedly under a false identity) following The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. He may have incited some of the more radical residents to violence. Daniel Defoe, the author of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and a committed Presbyterian throughout his life, was educated in Dorking for five years, . He attended a school in Pixham Lane run by Revd James Fisher a non-conformist who had been ejected as Rector of Fetcham. In 1662 Fisher was involved in establishing Dorking Congregational Church, which by the 1690s was meeting in a barn on Butter Hill in South Street. The present United Reformed Church in West Street, designed by the architect William Hopperton, was built for the group by William Shearburn in 1834.

John Wesley visited Dorking a total of nineteen times between 1764 and 1789. He opened a Methodist chapel in the town in 1777. A new church with a spire was built in South Street in 1900, however this building was sold and demolished in 1974. Since 1973, Dorking Methodists have held services at St Martin&#x27;s.

Although England had become a predominantly Protestant country during the Reformation, the families of the Earls of Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk remained Catholic. The first Catholic church in Dorking was built in the early 1870s on land owned by the fifteenth Duke of Norfolk, Henry Fitzalan-Howard and was rebuilt into the present St Joseph&#x27;s Church in the mid-1890s, by the architect Frederick Walters.

A mosque was established in Hart Road in 2006. From 1984 the building had been used as a meeting room for the Plymouth Brethren and was a synagogue for a time, before being acquired by the Dorking Muslim Community Association.

===Dorking in the World Wars===
In late 1914, Dorking became a garrison town. Empty houses were requisitioned and from January 1915 around 4000 troops were accommodated including those from the London Scottish regiment, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen&#x27;s Westminster Rifles. Training took place in the fields to the west and north west of the town. Many local residents were recruited to the Surrey Yeomanry, which (until mid-1915) was stationed at Deepdene House and at the Public Hall in West Street. Although he was aged over 40 at the start of the war, the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps, one unit of which was based in the town.

Of the many soldiers from Dorking who died during World War I, the youngest was Valentine Strudwick. He was born in Falkland Road on 14 February 1900 and was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School. He enlisted in 1915 after concealing his true age and joined the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort&#x27;s Own). A year later, in January 1916 at the age of 15 years 11 months, he was killed in action at Boezinge, near Ypres. He is buried at Essex Farm Cemetery in Belgium.
Empty houses in the town also provided billets for soldiers during World War II and over 3000 school children were evacuated to the Dorking area in September 1939. A local refugee committee (led by Vaughan Williams and the novelist E. M. Forster) was established to find accommodation for refugees fleeing Nazi persecution and also to support long-resident German and Czech nationals in applications to Home Office tribunals to remain at liberty in the UK.

At the start of the war, the fortified GHQ Line B was constructed directly to the north of Dorking. This defensive line ran along the North Downs from Farnham via Guildford, before following the River Mole to Horley. The banks of the Mole were fortified with anti-tank obstacles, pillboxes and gun emplacements and an anti-tank ditch was dug from west to east across Bradley Farm (now Denbies Wine Estate). The town itself was a Class &quot;A&quot; nodal point and from August 1940 the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade (part of the VII Corps) was assigned to its defence. Pippbrook House (the then offices of the Dorking UDC) became a mobilisation centre and housed an ARP post as well as the local branch of the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service.

Over the course of the war, 77 high-explosive bombs and 60 incendiaries were dropped by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, however only one incident (in October 1940) resulted in fatalities in the town.

After the war, at least two Covenanter tanks were buried at Bradley Farm. The first was excavated and restored in 1977 and is now on display at The Tank Museum at Bovington in Dorset. A second was excavated in 2017 for the archaeology programme &quot;WW2 Treasure Hunters&quot;, presented by the musician Suggs on the TV channel HISTORY. The tank was displayed at the vineyard for six months, before being removed for restoration.

==Public services==
===Utilities===

Until the early 18th century, local residents obtained drinking water either directly from the Pipp Brook or from wells. In 1735, a pump was installed to lift water from a spring on the site of Archway Place, which was then distributed via wooden pipes made from bored tree trunks. Local dissatisfaction over the charges levied for the supply prompted the vestry to reopen a well in the town centre and to install a hand pump there in 1780. The Archway Place spring became polluted by sewage in the middle of the 19th century and the works closed.

The Dorking Water Company (DWC) was formally established in 1869, following the passing of the Dorking Water Act 1869. The company dug a well on Harrow Road East from where water was transferred by a steam-driven pump to a reservoir on Tower Hill. In 1902, a new pumping station was built on Station Road and, in 1919, the old one was converted to housing. The second pumphouse was replaced by a new works with boreholes on Beech Close in 1939. The DWC was absorbed by East Surrey Water in 1959.

The Local Board of Health created the first sewerage system in Dorking and opened the treatment works at Pixham on the River Mole in 1888. Four years later, some 1360 houses (around 92% of the town) had been connected, necessitating an extensive rebuilding of the works in 1893. The sewerage system became the responsibility of the Thames Water Authority under the Water Act 1989.

The town gasworks were built in 1834 by the Dorking Gas Light Company to supply gas for street lighting. From 1849, the coal required was delivered by train to Dorking West station and then transferred to the works by horse-drawn vehicle. The company was merged with that of Redhill in 1928 and became part of the East Surrey Gas Company when the industry was nationalised in 1948. After gas production ceased in 1956, the site of the works became part of the Dorking Business Park on Station Road.

An electricity generating station was opened in 1903 in Station Road, close to the town gasworks. Initially it was capable of generating 180 kW of power, but by the time of its closure in 1939, its installed capacity was 1 MW. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, Dorking was connected to the National Grid, initially to a 33 kV supply ring, which linked the town to Croydon, Epsom, Leatherhead and Reigate. In 1939, the ring was connected to the Wimbledon-Woking main via a 132 kV substation at Leatherhead.

===Emergency services and justice===

A nightly patrol was established in Dorking in 1825 and in 1838 a small police force, initially with just three officers, was established under the Lighting and Watching Act 1833. This force became part of the Surrey Constabulary on its creation in 1851. A combined police station and magistrates&#x27; court complex was opened at the east end of the High Street in 1894 and the police station relocated to Moores Road in 1938. Purpose-built magistrates courts were opened adjacent to Pippbrook House in 1979 and closed in 2010.
A volunteer fire brigade was formed in 1870. Initially based at South Street, it moved to the Public Hall at the west end of West Street in 1881. The brigade became full time in 1912 and, in 1971, it moved to a new fire station adjacent to the newly built ambulance station at North Holmwood. In 2021, the fire authority for Dorking is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. Dorking Ambulance Station is run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service.

===Healthcare===

Dorking Cottage Hospital, opened in 1871 in South Terrace, was the first hospital in the town. It was merged in 1948 with the adjacent County Hospital, which had evolved from the Union Workhouse and Poor Law Infirmary, to form Dorking General Hospital. Since 2004, Dorking Hospital has been run as a community hospital by a consortium of local GP groups that provides Outpatient Services for the local area. The nearest accident &amp; emergency departments are at Epsom Hospital () and East Surrey Hospital (). As of 2020, there are GP practices on Reigate Road and South Street.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The A24 London-Worthing and the A25 Guildford-Sevenoaks roads intersect at Deepdene Roundabout on the eastern side of Dorking. The one-way system in the town centre was introduced in 1968.

===Railways===

The Epsom-Horsham and Guildford-Reigate railway lines cross to the northeast of Dorking, but there is now no physical connection between the two. The town is served by three railway stations. is managed by Southern and is served by trains to via , to via and to . and stations are managed by Great Western Railway and are served by trains to via and to via .

===Buses===

Route 32 from Dorking to Guildford via Shere and to Redhill via Earlswood is run by Compass Bus.
Route 93 from Dorking to Horsham via Goodwyns and Holmwood Park is run by Metrobus on behalf of Surrey County Council.
Route 465 from Dorking to Kingston upon Thames via Leatherhead is run by London United.
Routes 21 (Epsom – Dorking – Crawley) and 22 (Shere – Dorking – Crawley) are run by Metrobus.

===Cycle routes===

National Cycle Route 22 passes through the town centre and the Surrey Cycleway runs to the east.

===Long distance footpaths===
The Greensand Way, a long-distance footpath from Haslemere, Surrey to Hamstreet, Kent, passes through the south of Dorking. The route approaches the town centre from the east, passing over The Nower, then crossing the junction between South Street and Horsham Road. It climbs through the Glory Wood, before crossing Deepdene Terrace. The North Downs Way, between Farnham and Dover, passes approximately to the north of Dorking. Dorking station is the southern terminus of the Mole Gap Trail, which starts at .

==Education==
===Primary schools===
There are five primary schools in Dorking, the oldest of which is Powell Corderoy School. It was founded in 1816 as The Dorking British School, and its original premises were in West Street; but twenty years later it moved to North Street. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the school had expanded and the funds for a new building in Norfolk Road were raised by Edith Corderoy and Mr T. Powell. The new site was opened in 1898 and the school adopted its present name in 1906. The school moved to its current location in Longfield Road in 1968.

St Martin&#x27;s Primary School was founded as a National School by the vestry in the 1830s, however there is thought to have been a school located in the transepts of the parish church as early as the 17th century. The National School was moved from the grounds of the church to West Street in 1862. The Middle School relocated to Ranmore Road in 1969 and was joined by the First School in 1985. The Pixham First School was founded in 1880 by Mary Mayo and was built to a design by Gilbert Redgrave. St Paul&#x27;s Primary School was founded in 1860.

St Paul&#x27;s School was designed by the architect, Thomas Allom, and admitted its first pupils in March 1860. The infants department opened in 1872 and, from that year, the school educated children aged from 5 to 13. Today, St Paul&#x27;s is a Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School and educates children from the ages of 5 to 11.
St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School was founded in 1873 by Augusta Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk. The first premises were in Falkland Grove adjacent to St Joseph&#x27;s Church. The school was run by nuns of the Servite Order from 1887 to 1970, when it moved to its present site in Norfolk Road, which had been vacated by Powell Corderoy School.

St John&#x27;s Primary School was founded in 1955 on the Goodwyns housing estate to the south of the town. It was known as The Redlands Junior School until August 1999.

New Lodge School, a private prep school formed in 2002 from the merger of Stanway School and Nower Lodge School, closed in 2007.

===Secondary schools===
The Ashcombe School is a coeducational secondary school, north of the town centre. It traces its origins to the Dorking High School for Boys, founded in 1884, and the St Martin&#x27;s High School for Girls, opened in 1903. In 1931, the two schools were merged to become the Dorking County School and moved to a new site in Ashcombe Road. In 1959 the Mowbray County Secondary Modern for girls was opened on an adjacent site. The two schools were combined to create the Ashcombe School in 1975.

The Priory School opened as the County Secondary Modern Mixed School in September 1949. It was initially based at the Dene Street Institute, but moved to its present location in West Bank within a few years. In 1959, the girls were transferred to the Mowbray School in the Ashcombe Road, and Sondes Place continued as a boys-only school. In 1976 it became a mixed comprehensive school and was renamed the Priory School in 1996.

==Culture==
===Art===

The Dorking Group of Artists, established in 1947, exhibits locally twice a year, in Betchworth and at Denbies. The Arts Society Dorking promotes local art appreciation and the preservation of the town&#x27;s artistic heritage.

===Leith Hill Musical Festival===
The three-day Leith Hill Musical Festival for local, amateur choral societies, founded in 1905, takes place at the Dorking Halls each year. Ralph Vaughan Williams was the Festival Conductor until 1953, a post currently held by Jonathan Willcocks.

Each day features a different group (or division) of choirs, which compete against each other in the morning and then combine to give a concert in the evening. Following the tradition established by Vaughan Williams, the &quot;Messiah&quot; by Handel and the &quot;St Matthew&quot; and &quot;St John Passions&quot; by J. S. Bach are frequently performed.

After the death of Vaughan Williams in 1958, the festival committee commissioned David McFall to design a bronze bas relief likeness of the composer: one cast was placed in St Martin&#x27;s Church and another in the Dorking Halls.

===Recording studios===
Strawberry Studios South was opened in 1976, in a former cinema in South Street, by Graham Gouldman and Eric Stewart of the band 10cc. They recorded the album, &quot;Deceptive Bends&quot; there. Other artists also worked at the Studios, including Paul McCartney, who recorded part of &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot; (a duet with Stevie Wonder) there. The English rock band, The Cure, recorded at Rhino Studios at Pippbrook Mill.

===Literature===
&quot;The Battle of Dorking&quot;, a novella written by Lt. Col. Sir George Tomkyns Chesney in 1871, was set in the town. Describing a fictional invasion and conquest of Britain by a German-speaking country, it triggered an explosion of what came to be known as invasion literature.
Benjamin Disraeli wrote part of his political novel &quot;Coningsby&quot; while staying at Deepdene between 1841 and 1844. The novel was subsequently dedicated to his host, Henry Thomas Hope. The fourth chapter of &quot;A Fool&#x27;s Alphabet&quot; by novelist Sebastian Faulks, published in 1992, is set in the town.

==Sport==
===Shrove Tuesday football===
A football game was played annually in Dorking on Shrove Tuesday between two teams representing the eastern and western halves of the town. The match began at 2pm outside the gates to St Martin&#x27;s Church and lasted until 6pm. After a particularly riotous game in 1897, the local magistrates declared that the tradition was in breach of the Highway Act 1835 and 50 participants were fined. Arrests were also made after local townsfolk attempted to stage the match in 1898, 1899 and 1903. The local newspaper declared the custom extinct in 1907.

===Association football===

Dorking F.C. was formed in 1880 and moved to Meadowbank in 1956. The stadium was condemned as unsafe in 2013 and for the next three years, the club shared grounds, first at Horley and then Westhumble. Dorking F.C. closed in 2017.

Dorking Wanderers F.C. was founded in 1999. The team played its home games at Westhumble for ten seasons from 2007, before moving to the refurbished Meadowbank Stadium in July 2018.

===Rugby===
Dorking rugby football club was founded in 1921. Initially its home matches were played at Meadowbank, but it moved the following year to Pixham. In 1972 the club relocated to the Big Field at Brockham as tenants of the National Trust, which had acquired the field in 1966. In the 2019–20 season, the 1st XV played in the London and South East Premier division. Notable former players include Elliot Daly, George Kruis and Kay Wilson.

===Motor racing===

Rob Walker&#x27;s privateer racing team was based at Pippbrook Garage in London Road from 1947 to 1970. The team won nine Grands Prix and their drivers included Stirling Moss (1958–1961) and Graham Hill (1970). Walker&#x27;s contribution to motorsport and to Dorking was celebrated on the centenary of his birth in October 2018 with a parade of classic cars through the town centre.

===Cycling===
Dorking Cycling Club was founded in 1877 and by the 1890s was organising camps for amateur cyclists from across the south east of England. The club was refounded in 2011 and organises a programme of weekly rides for members. The 2012 Summer Olympic cycling road races passed through Dorking en route to Box Hill.

===Running===
Dorking and Mole Valley Athletics Club is based at Pixham Sports Ground. They host the annual &quot;Dorking Ten&quot; road race starting from Brockham Green.

The weekly Mole Valley Parkrun has taken place at Denbies Wine Estate since March 2018. The vineyard also hosts the annual Run Bacchus marathon. The annual UK Wife-Carrying Race takes place at The Nower.

==Tourist attractions==
===Denbies Wine Estate===

Denbies Wine Estate, to the north of Dorking, is one of the largest wine producers in the UK. The vineyard, which covers some , was first planted in 1986 on the site of Bradley Farm, part of the Denbies estate. The winery and visitor centre were opened in 1993.

===Dorking Museum===
Dorking Museum was opened in West Street in January 1976. The building had previously been an iron foundry, which had opened in the 1820s and closed after World War II. The museum houses a wide range of historical artefacts, as well as fossils and mineral samples from the Dorking area. Permanent displays explain the history of the town from prehistoric times to the present day, and the building also hosts temporary exhibitions, often connected with significant anniversaries of events such as World War I.

The museum was fully refurbished between 2008 and 2012 and was short-listed for the Museums Heritage Awards in 2013.

===South Street Caves===

The caves in South Street are thought to have been excavated in four distinct phases. Firstly, three wells, the largest of which has the date 1672 inscribed on its wall, were sunk vertically from Butter Hill above. The upper level, a network of four caverns which intersects the wells, was dug in the late 17th or early 18th centuries. These caves are linked by a staircase to the lowest level, a circular chamber which may have been used by religious dissenters, approximately below ground level. In Victorian times, the larger caverns were adapted for use as wine cellars. The current entrance to the caves dates from 1921.

The South Street caves were sold to Dorking UDC in 1921 and were leased by the council to various local wine merchants until the 1960s. The Dorking and Leith Hill Preservation Society first opened the caves for public tours in the 1970s. Dorking Museum assumed responsibility for running tours in May 2015. Prince Edward visited the caves in March of the same year.

===Other nearby attractions===

Several National Trust properties are close to Dorking, including Box Hill, Leith Hill, Polesden Lacey and Ranmore Common.

==Parks and open spaces==
===Cotmandene===
Cotmandene is a area of common land to the east of the town centre (the name is thought to mean &quot;the heath of the poor cottages&quot;). During the Middle Ages it was used by commoners to graze pigs. The first almshouses on the north side of Cotmandene were built in 1677 and were given endowments in 1718 and 1831. They were rebuilt in 1848 and again in 1961.

Cricket matches were played on the heath during the 18th century and are recorded in Edward Beavan&#x27;s 1777 poem &quot;Box Hill&quot;. A painting entitled &quot;A Cricket Match on Cotmandene, Dorking&quot; by the artist James Canter, dating to around 1770, is now held by the Marylebone Cricket Club. In the 19th century, a funfair took place at the same time as the Ascension Day livestock fair in the town centre. In 1897, to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk (who was lord of the manor of Dorking) gave Cotmandene to the Urban District Council (UDC) on the condition that it was &quot;to remain a perpetual ornament and pleasure to the town&quot;.

===Deepdene Terrace and Gardens===
Deepdene was a country house to the south-east of Dorking. Its name derives from the narrow natural amphitheatre in the former grounds, most likely formed by erosion of the sandstone hillside by spring water. The gardens were first laid out by Charles Howard in the 1650s and both the diarist, John Evelyn, and John Aubrey recorded visits there in the second half of the 17th century. The grounds include a mausoleum in which owners Thomas Hope and Henry Thomas Hope are buried.

In the late 19th century, the property began a period of decline accelerated by the bankruptcy of the owner, Lord Francis Hope, in 1896. Much of the estate was sold for housebuilding in the early 20th century. In 1943, the terrace and garden were purchased by the Dorking and Leith Hill Preservation Society (chaired by Ralph Vaughan Williams) and transferred to the UDC, however the house was demolished in 1969. In the mid-2010s, the garden was restored and was reopened to the public as the &quot;Deepdene Trail&quot;.

===Glory Wood===
The Glory Wood (the highest point in Dorking) is an area of primarily deciduous woodland to the southeast of the town centre. The southern part is known as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Den&quot; and contains mainly oak with an area of coppiced sweet chestnut.

The Glory Wood was promised to the town in 1927 by Lord Francis Hope, on the condition that it was not to be built upon. The land was to have been transferred to the UDC in July 1929, however Hope withheld the gift until 1934, in protest at the published route of the Dorking Bypass through the Deepdene estate.

===Meadowbank===

Meadowbank is a park on the north side of the Pipp Brook. In medieval times, it was part of the lordship lands and later became part of the Denbies estate. By the start of the 20th century, it was the grounds of large private house (also called &quot;Meadowbank&quot;). The house and grounds were purchased by Dorking UDC in 1926, with the intention of building 150 council houses, however owing to financial constraints, the Council instead decided to sell the western third for development. The Parkway estate was completed in 1935.

The park was landscaped in the decade before World War II and included the Pippbrook Mill mill pond, which was given to the town in 1934. From 1954, Meadowbank became the permanent home of Dorking Football Club until 2014. Dorking Wanderers F.C. moved to the refurbished ground in 2018.

===The Nower===

The Nower is an area of open grassland, which rises above Dorking to the west of the town centre. Together with the adjacent Milton Heath, it forms a nature reserve owned by Mole Valley District Council and is managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust.

The Nower was given to the town in 1931 by Charles Barclay, the owner of the Bury Hill estate, although it had been accessible to visitors since Victorian times. Views over Dorking may be enjoyed from &quot;The Temple&quot;, which dates from the early 19th century.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
===Dorking Cemetery===
Dorking Cemetery was opened in 1855 on farmland that had been purchased from the Deepdene estate. Two chapels were built for funeral services, one for Anglicans (with a rectangular floor plan) and one (with an octagonal floor plan) for non-conformists. Both were designed by Henry Clutton and were constructed from flint with stone dressings. An entrance lodge on Reigate Road was also provided. Originally the area of the cemetery was , but was enlarged to between 1884 and 1923.

The English novelist George Meredith and Victoria Cross recipient Charles Graham Robertson are among those buried there. The cemetery also contains 61 Commonwealth war graves of military personnel from the First and Second World Wars.

===Dorking Halls===

The Art Deco Dorking Halls building, designed by the architect Percy W. Meredith for the Leith Hill Musical Festival (LHMF), was opened in 1931. The Grand Hall was intended to be used for performances of the Passions by J. S. Bach, but two smaller halls (the Masonic and Martineau) were also constructed as part of the same complex. During World War II, the building was used by the Meat Marketing Board and the Army, and it was then sold to Dorking UDC. A major refurbishment was undertaken by Mole Valley District Council between 1994 and 1997. The Martineau Hall houses the Premier Cinema.

===Pippbrook House===

Pippbrook House, a Gothic country house to the north east of the town centre, was designed as a private residence for William Henry Forman by George Gilbert Scott in 1856. The house and surrounding were bought by the UDC in December 1930, for use as administrative offices. The UDC&#x27;s successor, MVDC, opened purpose-built offices in the grounds in 1984, which enabled the local public library to move into the space vacated. The library relocated to St Martin&#x27;s Walk in the town centre in 2012. In 2020, MVDC announced plans to develop Pippbrook House as a &quot;community hub and start-up business centre&quot;.

===White Horse Hotel===

The first building to be recorded on the site of the White Horse Hotel was granted to the Knights Templar by John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, in around 1287. When the Templars were suppressed in 1308 by order of Pope Clement V, the property was confiscated and passed to the Knights of the Order of St John. For much of the late medieval period, it was known as the &quot;Cross House&quot; and in the 16th century it was the residence of the parish priest.

The property became an inn around 1750 (by which time it was known as &quot;The White Horse&quot;), a few years before the opening of the Epsom to Horsham turnpike road. Most of the current hotel was built during the 18th century (including the timber-framed frontage which faces the High Street), however some parts date from the 15th and 16th centuries. Famous guests have included Charles Dickens who wrote his novel The Pickwick Papers, whilst resident in the mid-1830s. Further additions were made to the hotel in the 19th century, which is protected today by a Grade II listing.

===Statues and sculptures===

The galvanised metal sculpture of a Dorking cockerel by the artist Peter Parkinson was erected on the Deepdene roundabout in 2007. The statue pays homage to the historical importance of the town&#x27;s poultry market. The cockerel is a frequent target of yarn bombing and can be seen dressed in hats, scarves and other items of clothing.

The two statues outside the Dorking Halls were designed by William Fawke. The statue of architect and master builder Thomas Cubitt was installed in 1995. The statue of Ralph Vaughan Williams was donated by Sir Adrian White and was unveiled in 2001.

The sculpture of two cyclists at the Pixham End roundabout was unveiled in July 2012, less than two weeks before the Olympic road race events were routed through Dorking. The installation was designed by the artist Heather Burrell, and just over half of the cost was donated by members of the public, each of whom is represented by an oak leaf on either the cyclists&#x27; torsos or the bicycle wheels.

There are two sculptures by the artist Lucy Quinnell in the town: the first, a metal arch commemorating the writer and philosopher Grant Allen, was installed at the entrance to Allen Court in 2013; the second, depicting the &quot;Mayflower&quot; sailing westwards towards the New World, was commissioned by Mole Valley District Council and was unveiled in West Street in 2021.

===War memorial===

The town war memorial, in South Street, was dedicated in 1921 &quot;in memory of Dorking men who fell in the Great War&quot;. Designed by the architect Thomas Braddock, it was constructed from dressed Portland stone. The memorial was modified in 1945 to commemorate those who had died in World War II, with the addition of the wings at each side. At the base, a verse from 1 Samuel is inscribed: &quot;They were a wall unto us both by night and by day.&quot; The names of 264 people who died in the two conflicts (both military personnel and civilians) are recorded, including seven women. The memorial is protected by a Grade II listing.

<doc id="61850" wikidata="Q363832" url="?curid=61850" title="Conon">
<text>Conon () (before 443 BC – ) was an Athenian general at the end of the Peloponnesian War, who led the Athenian naval forces when they were defeated by a Peloponnesian fleet in the crucial Battle of Aegospotami; later he contributed significantly to the restoration of Athens&#x27; political and military power.

==Commanding the Athenian fleet==
Shortly after the Battle of Notium, Conon took over command of the Athenian fleet from Alcibiades, who had fled to Thrace. When the new Spartan navarch (commander-in-chief of the fleet) Callicratidas took over command from Lysander, he started an aggressive campaign against the Athenians in the Aegean. After taking Methymna in Lesbos, he sent a message to Conon, declaring that he would put an end to Conon&#x27;s command of the sea. Soon thereafter, Callicratidas caught Conon&#x27;s fleet of seventy ships at sea and pursued him towards Mytilene Harbor on Lesbos, where in the ensuing battle, Conon lost thirty ships. Conon drew the remaining forty ships up onto the beach, but while blockading him from sea, Callicratidas also surrounded him on land, having transported land forces from Chios and gaining the aid of the Methymnaeans.

Besieged by land and sea, Conon was unable to break out from the vastly superior forces that surrounded him and only barely slipped a messenger ship out to Athens. After some initial panic, Athens sent a sizable force sent out to raise the siege. Callicraditas met this force at the Battle of Arginusae. His force was soundly defeated, and Callicratidas himself was killed. After his death, Lysander returned from Sparta to take command of Sparta&#x27;s naval efforts in the Aegean.

==Defeat at Aegospotami==
Conon had been sent out to lead the Athenian forces following the recall of Alcibiades in 406 BC, and in 405 BC pursued the Peloponnesian fleet under Lysander to the Hellespont. Once there, the Peloponnesian took up a strong defensive position at Lampsacus and as they could not lure them out, the Athenians retreated to Aegospotami. Alcibiades came to warn them of the danger of their position, as they were based on an open beach without harbours, and advised them to move to Sestos about two miles away from where they were retrieving supplies. It seems that Alcibiades&#x27; advice was ignored and perhaps ridiculed.

On the fifth day of the stand-off, Lysander sent out scouts to spy on the Athenians. They signalled the main army once the Athenian crews had disembarked to take their meals. Thus when Lysander attacked almost the entire Athenian navy was caught unprepared and captured without resistance, and all the men taken were put to death. It was generally believed that some kind of treachery was involved, but Conon himself was never implicated. His ship was one of nine which escaped the disaster, boldly rushing to Lampsacus where the Spartans had left their fleet&#x27;s sails (as was typical before a naval battle) and so preventing any effective means of pursuit. One of the nine Athenian ships to escape, the Paralus, returned to Athens, while Conon, with the other eight ships, fled to Evagoras of Cyprus, fearing the judgement of the Athenian people.

==Aftermath and later career==

As a result of this victory, Sparta defeated the Athenians and so attempted to carve out her own empire in the Aegean. Her relationship with Persia deteriorated, and she began raiding the satrapies of Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes in Anatolia. By 397 BC, Pharnabazus had persuaded the Persian king Artaxerxes to prosecute the war by sea, and raised a fleet of 300 Phoenician and Cypriot ships. In sheer numbers they would be overwhelming, but they needed an experienced commander, and so they found Conon at Cyprus, who was only too happy for a chance to take revenge upon the Peloponnesians.

First Conon moved up to Caria with a small portion of the fleet, where he was for a time blocked but then rescued by Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes. He then proceeded to Rhodes, where the pro-Spartan oligarchy was replaced by a democracy, and managed to capture food supplies being sent up from Egypt. In response to this, the Spartans decided to send out their navy, but made the mistake of entrusting it to Peisander, who had no experience. The battle took place at Cnidus in 394 BC, and was an easy and overwhelming Persian success. The Aegean cities expelled the Spartan garrisons and accepted Persian rule.

After this success, Conon felt it was safe for him to return to Athens. Pharnabazus allowed him to retain part of the fleet, and supplied money for the fortification of Piraeus and the reconstruction of the long walls joining it to Athens. These actions meant that some of the main results of the Peloponnesian War were undone - Athens regained her position as a major power in Greece, and though she had still lost her empire, Sparta had been prevented from taking it over.

The next year the Spartans had opened negotiations with the Persians, and in order to secure their position in Greece offered to hand over all the cities in Anatolia to them. The Athenians sent delegates (including Conon) to announce this as unacceptable, which Tiribazus understood to mean that they still hoped to recover their empire and, outraged by this about-face, threw them in prison, Conon among them. Ancient writers give conflicting accounts of his end: some claim that he was sent into the interior of Asia and put to death; other accounts, probably more likely, record that he retired to Cyprus and died there. His son Timotheus later became another prominent general.

<text>Thomas Earl Petty (October 20, 1950October 2, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He was the leader and frontman of the rock bands Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Mudcrutch and a member of the late 1980s supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. He was also a successful solo artist.

Over the course of his career, Petty sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. His hit singles with the Heartbreakers include &quot;American Girl&quot; (1976), &quot;Don&#x27;t Do Me Like That&quot; (1979), &quot;Refugee&quot; (1980), &quot;The Waiting&quot; (1981), &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Here No More&quot; (1985) and &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; (1991). Petty&#x27;s solo hits include &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot; (1989), &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot; (1989), and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know How It Feels&quot; (1994).

Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Petty was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year in February 2017 for his contributions to music and for his philanthropy. He also acted; he had a recurring role as the voice of Lucky Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series &quot;King of the Hill&quot; from 2004 to the show&#x27;s conclusion in 2009.

Petty died of an accidental drug overdose in 2017 at the age of 66, one week after the end of the Heartbreakers&#x27; 40th Anniversary Tour.

==Early life and education==
Petty was born on October 20, 1950, in Gainesville, Florida, the first of two sons of Kitty Petty (née Avery), a local tax office worker, and Earl Petty, a traveling salesman. His brother, Bruce, was seven years younger.

Petty grew up in the Northeast Gainesville Residential District, known locally as the Duckpond. After his death, a historical marker was placed in the neighborhood and a nearby park was renamed to Tom Petty Park.

Petty attended Howard Bishop Middle School, where he played Little League baseball and basketball. He then attended Gainesville High School, where he graduated in 1968.

==Career==
Petty&#x27;s interest in rock and roll music began at age ten when he had an opportunity to meet Elvis Presley. In the summer of 1961, his uncle was working on the set of Presley&#x27;s film &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;, in nearby Ocala, and invited Petty to watch the movie&#x27;s filming.

Petty instantly became a Presley fan. When he returned that Saturday, he was greeted by his friend Keith Harben, and soon traded his Wham-O slingshot for a collection of Elvis 45s. Of that meeting with Presley, Petty said, &quot;Elvis glowed.&quot;

In 2006, Petty said he knew he wanted to be in a band the moment he saw the Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. &quot;The minute I saw the Beatles on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;—and it&#x27;s true of thousands of guys—there was the way out. There was a way to do it. You get your friends and you&#x27;re a self-contained unit. And you make the music. And it looked like so much fun. It was something I identified with. I had never been hugely into sports. ... I had been a big fan of Elvis. But I really saw in the Beatles that here&#x27;s something I could do. I knew I could do it. It wasn&#x27;t long before there were groups springing up in garages all over the place.&quot; He later said that the Rolling Stones inspired him by demonstrating that he and musicians like him could make it in rock and roll.

Don Felder, a fellow Gainesville resident who later joined the Eagles, wrote in his autobiography that he was one of Petty&#x27;s first guitar teachers although Petty said that Felder taught him to play piano instead.

As a young man, Petty worked briefly on the grounds crew of the University of Florida, but never attended as a student. An Ogeechee lime tree that he purportedly planted while employed at the university is now called the Tom Petty tree, though Petty said he did not recall planting any trees. He also worked briefly as a gravedigger.

===1976–1987: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers===
Shortly after embracing his musical aspirations, Petty started a band known as the Epics, which later evolved into Mudcrutch. The band included future Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench and was popular in Gainesville, but their recordings went unnoticed by a mainstream audience. They recorded at The Church Studio in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Their only single, &quot;Depot Street&quot;, released in 1975 by Shelter Records, failed to chart.

After Mudcrutch split up, Petty reluctantly agreed to pursue a solo career. Tench decided to form his own group, whose sound Petty appreciated. Eventually, Petty and Campbell collaborated with Tench, Ron Blair and Stan Lynch, forming the first lineup of the Heartbreakers. Their eponymous debut album gained little popularity among American audiences, achieving greater success in Britain. The singles &quot;American Girl&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; (re-released in 1977) peaked at after the band toured in the United Kingdom in support of Nils Lofgren. The debut album was released by Shelter Records, which at that time was distributed by ABC Records.

Their second album, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get It!&quot;, was the band&#x27;s first Top 40 album, featuring the singles &quot;I Need to Know&quot; and &quot;Listen to Her Heart&quot;. Their third album, &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot;, quickly went platinum, selling nearly two million copies; it includes their breakthrough singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Do Me Like That&quot;, &quot;Here Comes My Girl&quot;, &quot;Even the Losers&quot; and &quot;Refugee&quot;.

In September 1979, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed at a Musicians United for Safe Energy concert at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Their rendition of &quot;Cry to Me&quot; was featured on the resulting album, &quot;No Nukes&quot;.

Their fourth album, &quot;Hard Promises&quot;, released in 1981, became a top-ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single &quot;The Waiting&quot;. The album also featured Petty&#x27;s first duet, &quot;Insider&quot; with Stevie Nicks.

Bass player Ron Blair quit the group and was replaced on the fifth album, &quot;Long After Dark&quot; (1982), by Howie Epstein; the resulting lineup lasted until 1994. The album contained the hit &quot;You Got Lucky&quot;.

In 1985, the band participated in Live Aid, playing four songs at John F. Kennedy Stadium, in Philadelphia before a crowd of 89,484 people.

The band&#x27;s album, &quot;Southern Accents&quot;, was also released in 1985. It included the hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Here No More&quot;, produced by Dave Stewart. The song&#x27;s video featured Petty dressed as the Mad Hatter, mocking and chasing Alice from the book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, then cutting and eating her as if she were a cake. The ensuing tour led to the live album &quot;Pack Up the Plantation: Live!&quot; and an invitation from Bob Dylan to join Dylan on his 60-date True Confessions Tour through Asia, Oceania, and North America.

In 1986 and 1987, they played some dates with the Grateful Dead. Also in 1987, the group released &quot;Let Me Up (I&#x27;ve Had Enough)&quot; which includes &quot;Jammin&#x27; Me&quot; which Petty wrote with Dylan.

===1988–1991: Traveling Wilburys and solo career===

In 1988, Petty, along with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne, was a founding member of the Traveling Wilburys. The band&#x27;s first song, &quot;Handle with Care&quot;, was intended as a B-side of one of Harrison&#x27;s singles, but was judged too good for that purpose and the group decided to record a full album, &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot;. A second Wilburys album, mischievously titled &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3&quot; and recorded without the recently deceased Orbison, followed in 1990. The album was named &quot;Vol. 3&quot; as a response to a series of bootlegged studio sessions being sold as &quot;Travelling Wilburys Vol. 2&quot;. Petty incorporated Traveling Wilburys songs into his live shows, consistently playing &quot;Handle with Care&quot; in shows from 2003 to 2006, and for his 2008 tour adding &quot;surprises&quot; such as &quot;End of the Line&quot; to the set list.

In 1989, Petty released &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot;, which featured hits &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot;. It was nominally his first solo album, although several Heartbreakers and other well-known musicians participated: Mike Campbell co-produced the album with Petty and Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, and backing musicians included Campbell, Lynne, and fellow Wilburys Roy Orbison and George Harrison (Ringo Starr appears on drums in the video for &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, but they were actually performed by Phil Jones).

Petty and the Heartbreakers reformed in 1991 and released &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot;, which was co-produced by Lynne and included the hit singles &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; and &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot;, the latter featuring Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway in the music video.

Before leaving MCA Records, Petty and the Heartbreakers got together to record, live in the studio, two new songs for a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package: &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Last Dance&quot; and Thunderclap Newman&#x27;s &quot;Something in the Air&quot;. This was Stan Lynch&#x27;s last recorded performance with the Heartbreakers. Petty commented &quot;He left right after the session without really saying goodbye.&quot; The package went on to sell over ten million copies, therefore receiving diamond certification by the RIAA.

===1991–2017: Move to Warner Bros. Records===

In 1989, while still under contract to MCA, Petty secretly signed a lucrative deal with Warner Bros. Records, to which the Traveling Wilburys had been signed. His first album on his new label, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, Petty&#x27;s second of three solo albums, included the highly beloved title track, as well as the singles &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know How It Feels&quot;, &quot;You Wreck Me&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Good to Be King&quot;, and &quot;A Higher Place&quot;. The album, produced by Rick Rubin, sold over three million copies in the United States.

In 1996, Petty, with the Heartbreakers, released a soundtrack to the movie &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, starring Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston (see &quot;Songs and Music from &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;&quot;). The album&#x27;s singles were &quot;Walls (Circus)&quot; featuring Lindsey Buckingham, &quot;Climb that Hill&quot;, and a song written by Lucinda Williams, &quot;Change the Locks&quot;. The album also included a cover of &quot;Asshole&quot;, a song by Beck. The same year, the band accompanied Johnny Cash on &quot;Unchained&quot;, provisionally titled &quot;Petty Cash&quot;, for which Cash won a Grammy for Best Country Album. Cash later covered Petty&#x27;s &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot; on &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot;.

In 1999, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released their last album with Rubin at the helm, &quot;Echo&quot;. Two songs were released as singles in the US, &quot;Room at the Top&quot; and &quot;Free Girl Now&quot;. The album reached number 10 on the US album charts.

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers played &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot; at the benefit concert for victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The following year, they played &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Handle with Care&quot; (joined for the last by Jeff Lynne, Dhani Harrison, and Jim Keltner) at the &quot;Concert for George&quot; in honor of Petty&#x27;s friend and former bandmate George Harrison.

Petty&#x27;s 2002 release, &quot;The Last DJ&quot;, was an album-length critique of practices within the music industry. The title track, inspired by Los Angeles radio personality Jim Ladd, bemoaned the end of the freedom that radio DJs once had to personally select songs for their station&#x27;s playlists. The album peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in the United States.

In 2005, Petty began hosting his own show &quot;Buried Treasure&quot; on XM Satellite Radio, on which he shared selections from his personal record collection.

In 2006, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers headlined the fifth annual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival as part of their &quot;30th Anniversary Tour&quot;. Special guests included Stevie Nicks, Pearl Jam, the Allman Brothers Band, Trey Anastasio, the Derek Trucks Band, and the Black Crowes. Nicks joined Petty and the Heartbreakers on stage for several songs including &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Heart Around&quot;.

In July 2006, Petty released a solo album titled &quot;Highway Companion&quot;, which included the hit &quot;Saving Grace&quot;. It debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, which was Petty&#x27;s highest chart position since the introduction of the Nielsen SoundScan system for tracking album sales in 1991. &quot;Highway Companion&quot; was briefly promoted on the tour with the Heartbreakers in 2006, with performances of &quot;Saving Grace&quot;, &quot;Square One&quot;, &quot;Down South&quot; and &quot;Flirting with Time&quot;.

During the summer of 2007, Petty reunited with his old bandmates Tom Leadon and Randall Marsh, along with Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell, to reform his pre-Heartbreakers band Mudcrutch. The quintet recorded an album of 14 songs that was released on April 29, 2008 (on iTunes, an additional song &quot;Special Place&quot; was available if the album was pre-ordered). The band supported the album with a brief tour of California in the spring of 2008.

In 2007, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers contributed a cover of &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot; to the album &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot;. The album&#x27;s sales helped buy instruments for students in New Orleans public schools and contributed to the building of a community center in the city&#x27;s Hurricane Katrina-damaged Ninth Ward.

On February 3, 2008, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed during the halftime-show of Super Bowl XLII at the University of Phoenix Stadium. They played &quot;American Girl&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, &quot;Free Fallin&quot; and &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot;. That summer, the band toured North America with Steve Winwood as the opening act. Winwood joined Petty and the Heartbreakers on stage at select shows and performed his Spencer Davis Group hit &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot;, and occasionally he performed his Blind Faith hit &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home&quot;. In November 2009 the boxed set &quot;The Live Anthology&quot;, a compilation of live recordings from 1978 to 2006, was released.

The band&#x27;s twelfth album &quot;Mojo&quot; was released on June 15, 2010, and reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. Petty described the album as &quot;Blues-based. Some of the tunes are longer, more jam-y kind of music. A couple of tracks really sound like the Allman Brothers—not the songs but the atmosphere of the band.&quot; To promote the record, the band appeared as the musical guests on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on May 17, 2010. The release of &quot;Mojo&quot; was followed by a North American summer tour. Prior to the tour, five of the band&#x27;s guitars, including two owned by Petty, were stolen from their practice space in Culver City, California in April 2010. The items were recovered by Los Angeles police the next week.

In 2012, the band went on a world tour that included their first European dates in 20 years and their first ever concerts in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.

On July 28, 2014, Reprise Records released Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&#x27; thirteenth studio album, &quot;Hypnotic Eye&quot;. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the band&#x27;s first album to top the chart. On November 20, 2015, the Tom Petty Radio channel debuted on SiriusXM.

In 2017, the Heartbreakers embarked on a 40th Anniversary Tour of the United States. The tour began on April 20 in Oklahoma City and ended on September 25 with a performance at the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood, California. The Hollywood Bowl concert, which would ultimately be the Heartbreakers&#x27; final show, ended with a performance of &quot;American Girl&quot;.

On September 28, 2018, Reprise Records released &quot;An American Treasure&quot;, a 60-track career-spanning box set featuring dozens of previously unreleased recordings, alternate versions of classic songs, rarities, historic live performances and deep tracks. The box set was preceded by the first single, &quot;Keep A Little Soul&quot;, in July 2018. The song is an unreleased outtake originally recorded in 1982 during the &quot;Long After Dark&quot; sessions.

In 2024, he posthumously appeared on rapper Snoop Dogg&#x27;s twentieth studio album &quot;Missionary&quot;, on the track &quot;Last Dance with Mary Jane&quot;, also featuring fellow singer Jelly Roll.

===Acting===
Petty&#x27;s first appearance in film took place in 1978, when he had a cameo in &quot;FM&quot;. He later had a small part in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; and appeared in several episodes of &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; between 1987 and 1990, playing himself as one of Garry Shandling&#x27;s neighbors. Petty was also featured in Shandling&#x27;s other show, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, as one of the story within a story final guests. In the episode, Petty gets bumped from the show and nearly comes to blows with Greg Kinnear.

Petty appeared in the 1997 film &quot;The Postman&quot;, directed by and starring Kevin Costner, as the Bridge City Mayor (from the dialogue it is implied that he is playing a future history version of himself). In 2002, he appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;How I Spent My Strummer Vacation&quot;, along with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Lenny Kravitz, Elvis Costello, and Brian Setzer. In it, Petty spoofed himself as a tutor to Homer Simpson on the art of lyric writing, composing a brief song about a drunk girl driving down the road while concerned with the state of public schools. Later in the episode, he loses a toe during a riot.

Petty had a recurring role as the voice of Elroy &quot;Lucky&quot; Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series &quot;King of the Hill&quot; from 2004 to 2009. In 2010, Petty made a five-second cameo appearance with comedian Andy Samberg in a musical video titled &quot;Great Day&quot; featured on the bonus DVD as part of The Lonely Island&#x27;s new album &quot;Turtleneck &amp; Chain&quot;.

==Views on artistic control==
Petty was known as a staunch guardian of his artistic control and artistic freedom. In 1979, he was involved in a legal dispute when ABC Records was sold to MCA Records. He refused to be transferred to another record label without his consent. In May 1979, he filed for bankruptcy and was signed to the new MCA subsidiary Backstreet Records.

In early 1981, the upcoming Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album, which would become &quot;Hard Promises&quot;, was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Gaucho&quot; and the Olivia Newton-John/Electric Light Orchestra &quot;Xanadu&quot; soundtrack. This so-called &quot;superstar pricing&quot; was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98. Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album and naming it &quot;Eight Ninety-Eight&quot; were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase.

In 1987, Petty sued tire company B.F. Goodrich for $1 million for using a song very similar to his song &quot;Mary&#x27;s New Car&quot; in a TV commercial. The ad agency that produced the commercial had previously sought permission to use Petty&#x27;s song but was refused. A judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting further use of the ad and the suit was later settled out of court. Petty also disallowed George W. Bush from using &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot; for his 2000 presidential campaign. His family would do the same for Donald Trump in 2020, stating &quot;Tom Petty would never want a song of his used for a campaign of hate.&quot;

Some outlets have claimed that the Red Hot Chili Peppers single &quot;Dani California&quot;, released in May 2006, bears a close musical similarity to Petty&#x27;s &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Last Dance&quot;. Petty told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;I seriously doubt that there is any negative intent there. And a lot of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs sound alike. Ask Chuck Berry. The Strokes took &#x27;American Girl&#x27; for their song &#x27;Last Nite&#x27;, and I saw an interview with them where they actually admitted it. That made me laugh out loud. I was like, &#x27;OK, good for you&#x27; ... If someone took my song note for note and stole it maliciously, then maybe [I&#x27;d sue]. But I don&#x27;t believe in lawsuits much. I think there are enough frivolous lawsuits in this country without people fighting over pop songs.&quot;

In January 2015, it was revealed that Petty and Jeff Lynne would receive royalties from Sam Smith&#x27;s song &quot;Stay with Me&quot; after its writers acknowledged similarities between it and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;. Petty and co-composer Lynne were each awarded 12.5% of the royalties from &quot;Stay with Me&quot;, and their names were added to the ASCAP song credit. Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying, &quot;All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam&#x27;s people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement&quot;.

==Personal life==
Petty overcame a difficult relationship with his father. He said his father found it difficult to accept that Petty was &quot;a mild-mannered kid who was interested in the arts&quot; and subjected him to verbal and physical abuse on a regular basis. Petty described his father as a &quot;wild, gambling drinker guy&quot;. He was close to his mother and his brother, Bruce.

Petty married Jane Benyo in 1974. They had two daughters: Adria, a director, and Annakim, an artist. Benyo told mutual friend Stevie Nicks that she met Petty at &quot;the age of seventeen&quot;. Nicks misheard Benyo&#x27;s North Florida accent, inspiring the title of her song &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;. Petty and Benyo divorced in 1996.

On May 17, 1987, an arsonist set fire to Petty&#x27;s house in Encino, California. Firefighters were able to salvage the basement recording studio and the original tapes stored there, as well as his Gibson Dove acoustic guitar. His signature gray top hat was destroyed. The perpetrator was never caught.

Petty struggled with heroin addiction following his divorce from Benyo. He cited the emotional pain of the divorce as a cause. He got clean after going to rehab in 1999, crediting his then-girlfriend Dana York with saving his life by helping him seek treatment.

On June 3, 2001, Petty and York were married in Las Vegas. They married again at their home in Malibu on June 21. Little Richard officiated the wedding, and an all-female mariachi band performed. York had a son from a previous marriage, Dylan.

Petty spoke in 2014 of the benefits from his practice of Transcendental Meditation.

==Death==

On October 1, 2017, Petty&#x27;s wife Dana York found him not breathing and in cardiac arrest at their home. He was resuscitated and taken to the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, where he was put on life support. He died at 8:40p.m. PDT on October 2. There were premature reports of his death throughout the day.

A memorial service for Petty was held at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, on October 16, 2017.

On January 19, 2018, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner announced that Petty&#x27;s death was due to an &quot;accidental overdose&quot; stating &quot;multisystem organ failure due to resuscitated cardiopulmonary arrest due to mixed drug toxicity&quot;, a combination of fentanyl, oxycodone, acetylfentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl (all opioids); temazepam and alprazolam (both benzodiazepines); and citalopram (an antidepressant). In a statement on his website, Petty&#x27;s wife and daughter said he had a number of medical problems, including emphysema, knee difficulties &quot;and most significantly a fractured hip&quot;. He was prescribed pain medication for these problems and informed on the day of his death that his hip injury had worsened. The statement read, &quot;[it] is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his overuse of medication.[..] We feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident.&quot;

On September 23, 2018, Petty&#x27;s widow Dana gave an interview to &quot;Billboard&quot; saying that Petty put off hip surgery his doctors had recommended for some time. &quot;He&#x27;d had it in mind it was his last tour and he owed it to his long-time crew, from decades some of them, and his fans.&quot; Dana said that Petty was in a good mood the day before his death: &quot;He had those three shows in L.A. Never had he been so proud of himself, so happy, so looking forward to the future—and then he&#x27;s gone.&quot;

==Equipment==
Petty owned and used a number of guitars over the years. He also used Rickenbacker guitars from 1979 onwards. The Rickenbacker 660/12TP neck was designed by Petty and featured his signature from 1991 to 1997. He also extensively played several Fender Telecasters and a Guild D25 12-string acoustic.

Petty&#x27;s later amplifier setup featured two Fender Vibro-King 60-watt combos.

==Awards and honors==

In October 1981, and again in September 2006, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers received the keys to the city of Gainesville, Florida, where he and his bandmates either lived or grew up.

In 1994, &quot;You Got Lucky&quot;, a Petty tribute album featuring such bands as Everclear and Silkworm was released.

In April 1996, Petty received UCLA&#x27;s George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement. The next month, Petty won the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers&#x27; Golden Note Award.

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999, for their contribution to the recording industry.

In December 2001, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which further honored Petty with an exhibit of his items from July 2006 until 2007.

He is ranked 91st on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of the Greatest Artists of All Time.

Petty received the &quot;Billboard&quot; Century Award, the organization&#x27;s highest honor for creative achievement on December 6, 2005.

Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s documentary film on Petty&#x27;s career titled &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot; premiered at the New York Film Festival in October 2007.

Petty was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year in February 2017 for his contributions to music and for his philanthropy.

A week after his death in 2017, a tribute to Petty was painted on Gainesville&#x27;s Southwest 34th Street Wall. It reads &quot;Love you always, Gainesville No. 1 Son, Thanks, Tommy&quot;.

In October 2018, on what would have been the singer&#x27;s 68th birthday, the city of Gainesville renamed the former Northeast Park, a park where a young Petty had often visited, as Tom Petty Park.

In December 2021, the University of Florida board of trustees unanimously voted to posthumously award Petty with an honorary PhD from the school.

He has three albums, &quot;Wildflowers&quot; (No. 214), &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot; (No. 231), and &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; (No. 298) on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. He has two songs on the same magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. &quot;American Girl&quot; (No. 169), and &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot; (No. 219).

In October 2022, the University of Florida&#x27;s &quot;Pride of the Sunshine&quot; dedicated their halftime show to Tom Petty&#x27;s music as part of the university&#x27;s inaugural Tom Petty Day. The band would continue to tribute their performances to Tom Petty during halftime in several other games throughout the 2022-23 football season.

In December 2023, Petty&#x27;s song &quot;Love Is a Long Road&quot; was used in the first trailer for &quot;Grand Theft Auto VI&quot;, which is considered one of the most anticipated video games ever made. This trailer gained over 90 million YouTube views within the first 24 hours. Because of this immense bump in popularity, the song itself gained nearly 1 million YouTube views in the same time span, gained a 36,979% increase on Spotify, had almost 250,000 searches on Shazam, and ranked second on the worldwide iTunes chart.

<text>McKinley Morganfield (April 4, 1914April 30, 1983), better known as Muddy Waters was an American blues singer-songwriter and musician who was an important figure in the post-World War II blues scene, and is often cited as the &quot;father of modern Chicago blues&quot;. His style of playing has been described as &quot;raining down Delta beatitude&quot;.

Muddy Waters grew up on Stovall Plantation near Clarksdale, Mississippi, and by age 17 was playing the guitar and the harmonica, copying local blues artists Son House and Robert Johnson. In 1941, Alan Lomax and Professor John W. Work III of Fisk University recorded him in Mississippi for the Library of Congress. In 1943, he moved to Chicago to become a full-time professional musician. In 1946, he recorded his first records for Columbia Records and then for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess.

In the early 1950s, Muddy Waters and his band—Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums and Otis Spann on piano—recorded several songs that became blues classics, some with the bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon. These songs included &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man,&quot; &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;. In 1958, he traveled to England, laying the foundations of the resurgence of interest in the blues there. His performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960 was recorded and released as his first live album, &quot;At Newport 1960&quot;.

Muddy Waters&#x27; music has influenced various American music genres, including rock and roll and subsequently rock.

==Early life==
Muddy Waters&#x27; place and date of birth are not conclusively known. He stated that he was born in 1915 at Rolling Fork in Sharkey County, Mississippi, but other evidence suggests that he was born in the unincorporated community of Jug&#x27;s Corner, in neighboring Issaquena County, in 1913. In the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians&#x27; union card. A 1955 interview in the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; is the earliest in which he stated 1915 as the year of his birth, and he continued to state that year in interviews from that point onward. The 1920 census lists him as five years old as of March 6, 1920. The Social Security Death Index, relying on the Social Security card application submitted after his move to Chicago in the mid-1940s, lists him as being born April 4, 1913. His gravestone gives his birth year as 1915.

His grandmother, Della Grant, raised him after his mother died shortly after his birth. Grant gave him the nickname &quot;Muddy&quot; at an early age because he loved to play in the muddy water of nearby Deer Creek. &quot;Waters&quot; was added years later, as he began to play harmonica and perform locally in his early teens. He taught himself to play harmonica. The remains of the cabin on Stovall Plantation where he lived in his youth are now at the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale, Mississippi.

He had his first introduction to music in church: &quot;I used to belong to church. I was a good Baptist, singing in the church. So I got all of my good moaning and trembling going on for me right out of church,&quot; he recalled. By the time he was 17, he had purchased his first guitar. &quot;I sold the last horse that we had. Made about fifteen dollars for him, gave my grandmother seven dollars and fifty cents, I kept seven-fifty and paid about two-fifty for that guitar. It was a Stella. The people ordered them from Sears-Roebuck in Chicago.&quot; He started playing his songs in joints near his hometown, mostly on a plantation owned by Colonel William Howard Stovall.

==Career==
===Early career, 1930s–1948===
In the early 1930s, he accompanied Big Joe Williams on tours of the Delta, playing harmonica. Williams recounted to Blewett Thomas that he eventually dropped Muddy &quot;because he was takin&#x27; away my women [fans]&quot;.

In August 1941, Alan Lomax went to Stovall, Mississippi, on behalf of the Library of Congress to record various country blues musicians. &quot;He brought his stuff down and recorded me right in my house,&quot; Muddy told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, &quot;and when he played back the first song I sounded just like anybody&#x27;s records. Man, you don&#x27;t know how I felt that Saturday afternoon when I heard that voice and it was my own voice. Later on he sent me two copies of the pressing and a check for twenty bucks, and I carried that record up to the corner and put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, &#x27;I can do it, I can do it&#x27;.&quot; Lomax came back in July 1942 to record him again. Both sessions were eventually released by Testament Records as &quot;Down on Stovall&#x27;s Plantation&quot;. The complete recordings were reissued by Chess Records on CD as &quot;Muddy Waters: The Complete Plantation Recordings. The Historic 1941–42 Library of Congress Field Recordings&quot; in 1993 and remastered in 1997.

In 1943, he headed to Chicago with the hope of becoming a full-time professional musician. He recalled arriving in Chicago as the single most momentous event in his life. He lived with a relative for a short period while driving a truck and working in a factory by day and performing at night. Big Bill Broonzy, then one of the leading bluesmen in Chicago, had Muddy open his shows in the rowdy clubs where Broonzy played. This gave him the opportunity to play in front of a large audience. In 1944, he bought his first electric guitar and then formed his first electric combo. He felt obliged to electrify his sound in Chicago because, he said, &quot;When I went into the clubs, the first thing I wanted was an amplifier. Couldn&#x27;t nobody hear you with an acoustic.&quot; His sound reflected the optimism of postwar African Americans. Willie Dixon said that &quot;There was quite a few people around singing the blues but most of them was singing all sad blues. Muddy was giving his blues a little pep.&quot;

In 1946, he recorded some songs for Mayo Williams at Columbia Records, with an old-fashioned combo consisting of clarinet, saxophone and piano; they were released a year later with Ivan Ballen&#x27;s Philadelphia-based 20th Century label, billed as James &quot;Sweet Lucy&quot; Carter and his Orchestra – Muddy Waters&#x27; name was not mentioned on the label. Later that year, he began recording for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by the brothers Leonard and Phil Chess. In 1947, he played guitar with Sunnyland Slim on piano on the cuts &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; and &quot;Little Anna Mae&quot;. These were also shelved, but in 1948, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be Satisfied&quot; and &quot;I Feel Like Going Home&quot; became hits, and his popularity in clubs began to take off. Soon after, Aristocrat changed its name to Chess Records. His signature tune &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; also became a hit that year.

=== Commercial success, 1948–1957 ===
Initially, the Chess brothers would not allow Muddy Waters to use his working band in the recording studio; instead, they provided him with bass backing by Ernest &quot;Big&quot; Crawford or by musicians assembled specifically for the recording session, including &quot;Baby Face&quot; Leroy Foster and Johnny Jones. Gradually, Chess relented, and by September 1953 he was recording with one of the most acclaimed blues groups in history: Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums, Otis Spann on piano and sometimes, bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon. The band recorded a number of blues songs which have become classics including &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;.

His band became a proving ground for some of the city&#x27;s best blues talent, with members of the ensemble going on to successful careers of their own. In 1952, Little Walter left when his single &quot;Juke&quot; became a hit, although he continued working with Muddy long after he left the band, appearing on most of the Muddy&#x27;s classic recordings in the 1950s. In 1954, Howlin&#x27; Wolf moved to Chicago with money that he earned through the success of the singles he recorded at Sun Records which Chess released, and the legendary rivalry with Muddy began. The rivalry was, in part, stoked by Willie Dixon providing songs to both artists, with Wolf suspecting that Muddy was getting Dixon&#x27;s best songs. In 1955, Jimmy Rogers left to work exclusively with his own band which had been a sideline until that time.

In the mid-1950s, his singles were frequently on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s various Rhythm &amp; Blues charts including &quot;Sugar Sweet&quot; in 1955 and &quot;Trouble No More&quot;, &quot;Forty Days and Forty Nights&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go No Farther&quot; in 1956. 1956 also saw the release of one of his best-known numbers, &quot;Got My Mojo Working&quot;, although it did not appear on the charts. However, by the late 1950s, his singles success had come to an end, with only &quot;Close to You&quot; reaching the chart in 1958. Also in 1958, Chess released his first compilation album, &quot;The Best of Muddy Waters&quot;, which collected twelve of his singles up to 1956.

=== Performances and crossover, 1958–1970 ===
Muddy toured England with Spann in 1958 where they were backed by local Dixieland-style or &quot;trad jazz&quot; musicians, including Chris Barber and members of his band. At the time, English audiences had only been exposed to acoustic folk blues, as performed by artists such as Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, and Big Bill Broonzy. Both the musicians and audiences were unprepared for his performance, which included electric slide guitar playing. He recalled:

Although his performances alienated the old guard, some younger musicians, including Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies from Barber&#x27;s band, were inspired to go in the more modern, electric blues direction. Korner and Davies&#x27; own groups included musicians who would later form the Rolling Stones (named after Waters&#x27;s 1950 hit &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;), Cream, and the original Fleetwood Mac.

In the 1960s, his performances continued to introduce a new generation to Chicago blues. At the Newport Jazz Festival, he recorded one of the first live blues albums, &quot;At Newport 1960&quot;, and his performance of &quot;Got My Mojo Working&quot; was nominated for a Grammy award. In September 1963, in Chess&#x27; attempt to connect with folk music audiences, he recorded &quot;Folk Singer&quot;, which replaced his trademark electric guitar sound with an acoustic band, including a then-unknown Buddy Guy on acoustic guitar. &quot;Folk Singer&quot; was not a commercial success, but it was lauded by critic Joe Kane, and in 2003 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed it at number 280 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In October 1963, Waters participated in the first of several annual European tours, organized as the American Folk Blues Festival, during which he also performed more acoustic-oriented numbers.

In 1967, he re-recorded several blues standards with Bo Diddley, Little Walter, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf, which were marketed as &quot;Super Blues&quot; and &quot;The Super Super Blues Band&quot; albums in Chess&#x27; attempt to reach a rock audience. &quot;The Super Super Blues Band&quot; united Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Muddy Waters, who had a long-standing rivalry. It was, as Ken Chang wrote in his AllMusic review, flooded with &quot;contentious studio banter [...] more entertaining than the otherwise unmemorable music from this stylistic train wreck&quot;. In 1968, at the insistance of Marshall Chess, he recorded &quot;Electric Mud&quot;, an album intended to revive his career by backing him with Rotary Connection, a psychedelic soul band that Chess had put together. The album proved controversial; although it reached number 127 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, it was scorned by many critics, and eventually disowned by Muddy himself:

Nonetheless, six months later he recorded a follow-up album, &quot;After the Rain&quot;, which had a similar sound and featured many of the same musicians.

Later in 1969, he recorded and released the album &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;, where he returned to his classic Chicago sound. &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; had an all-star backing band that included Michael Bloomfield and Paul Butterfield, longtime fans whose desire to play with him was the impetus for the album. It was the most successful album of Muddy Waters&#x27; career, reaching number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===Resurgence and later career, 1971–1982===

In 1971, Chess recorded a show at Mister Kelly&#x27;s, an upscale Chicago nightclub. The album signaled Muddy&#x27;s return to form and cemented his appeal with white audiences.

In 1972, he won his first Grammy Award, for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording for &quot;They Call Me Muddy Waters&quot;, a 1971 album of old but previously unreleased recordings.

Later in 1972, he flew to England to record the album &quot;The London Muddy Waters Sessions&quot;. The album was a follow-up to the previous year&#x27;s &quot;The London Howlin&#x27; Wolf Sessions&quot;. Both albums were the brainchild of Chess Records producer Norman Dayron, and were intended to showcase Chicago blues musicians playing with the younger British rock musicians whom they had inspired. He brought with him two American musicians, harmonica player Carey Bell and guitarist Sammy Lawhorn. The British and Irish musicians who played on the album included Rory Gallagher, Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, and Mitch Mitchell. Muddy was dissatisfied by the results, due to the British musicians&#x27; more rock-oriented sound. &quot;These boys are top musicians. They can play with me, put the book before &#x27;em and play it, you know,&quot; he told Guralnick. &quot;But that ain&#x27;t what I need to sell my people. It ain&#x27;t the Muddy Waters sound. An&#x27; if you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man.&quot; He stated, &quot;My blues look so simple, so easy to do, but it&#x27;s not. They say my blues is the hardest blues in the world to play.&quot; Nevertheless, the album won another Grammy, again for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording.

He won another Grammy for his last LP on Chess, &quot;The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album&quot;, recorded in 1975 with a new band, guitarist Bob Margolin; pianist Pinetop Perkins and Paul Butterfield on harmonica with Levon Helm and Garth Hudson of the Band on drums, organ, accordion and saxophone. In November 1976, he appeared as a featured special guest at the Band&#x27;s Last Waltz farewell concert, and in the subsequent 1978 feature film documentary of the event.

He performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1972, 1974 and 1977. An album, CD, and streaming release featuring many of his best known songs from these performances was compiled in 2021 as &quot;Muddy Waters: The Montreux Years&quot;. In 1974, his backing musicians in Montreux included Buddy Guy, Pinetop Perkins, Junior Wells, and Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman. Wyman and Perkins also performed with him in 1977.

From 1977 to 1981, blues musician Johnny Winter, who idolized Muddy since childhood and who had become a friend, produced four albums for him, all on the Blue Sky Records label: the studio albums &quot;Hard Again&quot; (1977), &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot; (1978) and &quot;King Bee&quot; (1981), and the live album, &quot;Muddy &quot;Mississippi&quot; Waters – Live&quot; (1979). The albums were critical and commercial successes, with all but &quot;King Bee&quot; winning a Grammy. &quot;Hard Again&quot; has been especially praised by critics, who have tended to describe it as his comeback album.

In 1981, he was invited to perform at Chicago Fest, the city&#x27;s top outdoor music festival. He was joined onstage by Johnny Winter and Buddy Miles, and played classics like &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;, &quot;Trouble No More&quot;, and &quot;Mojo Working&quot; to a new generation of fans. Shout! Factory made the performances available on DVD in 2009. On November 22, he performed live with three members of the Rolling Stones (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood) at the Checkerboard Lounge, a blues club in Bronzeville, on the South Side of Chicago, which Buddy Guy and L.C. Thurman opened in 1972. A DVD of the performance, &quot;Live at the Checkerboard Lounge, Chicago 1981&quot;, was released in 2012.

In 1982, he cut way back on performing due to declining health. His last public performance took place when he sat in with Eric Clapton&#x27;s band at a concert in Florida in the summer of 1982.

==Personal life, death and estate==

Muddy Waters was married to his first wife, Mabel Berry, from 1932 to 1935. 

Muddy Waters&#x27; second wife, whom he married in the 1940s, Geneva Wade, died of cancer on March 15, 1973. Gaining custody of three of his children, Joseph, Renee, and Rosalind, he moved them into his home, eventually buying a new house in Westmont, Illinois. In 1977, he met Marva Jean Brooks, whom he nicknamed &quot;Sunshine&quot;, at a Florida hotel; Eric Clapton served as best man at their wedding in 1979.

He had at least six children, including illegitimate children.

Two of his sons Larry &quot;Mud&quot; Morganfield and Big Bill Morganfield are also blues singers and musicians. In 2017, his youngest son, Joseph &quot;Mojo&quot; Morganfield, began publicly performing the blues, and played occasionally with his brothers; he died in 2020 at the age of 56.

Muddy Waters died in his sleep at his home in Westmont, Illinois, on April 30, 1983 from heart failure and cancer-related complications. He was taken from his Westmont home, where he lived for the last decade of his life, to Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove, Illinois, where he was pronounced dead. His funeral was held on May 4, 1983. Throngs of blues musicians and fans attended his funeral at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. He is buried next to his wife, Geneva.

After his death, a decades-long court battle ensued between his heirs and Scott Cameron, his manager at the time. In 2010, his heirs were petitioning the courts to appoint Mercy Morganfield, his daughter, as administrator who would then control the assets of his estate which were mainly copyrights to his music. The petition to reopen the estate was successful. Following Cameron&#x27;s death, the heirs&#x27; lawyers, in May 2018, sought to hold Scott Cameron&#x27;s wife in contempt for allegedly diverting royalty income. The heirs, however, asked for that citation not to be pursued. The last court date was held on July 10, 2018, and, as of 2023, the disputed arrangement remained unchanged.

==Legacy==
Two years after his death, the city of Chicago paid tribute to him by designating the one-block section between 900 and 1000 East 43rd Street near his former home on the south side &quot;Honorary Muddy Waters Drive&quot;. In 2017, a ten stories-mural commissioned as a part of the Chicago Blues Festival and designed by Brazilian artist Eduardo Kobra was painted on the side of the building at 17 North State Street, at the corner of State and Washington Streets. The Chicago suburb of Westmont, where he lived the last decade of his life, named a section of Cass Avenue near his home &quot;Honorary Muddy Waters Way&quot;.

In 2008, the Mississippi Blues Commission marked the site of his cabin with a marker as part of the Mississippi Blues Trail in Clarksdale, Mississippi. He also received a plaque on the Clarksdale Walk of Fame.

Muddy Waters&#x27; Chicago Home in the Kenwood neighborhood is in the process of being named a Chicago Landmark.

A crater on Mercury was named in his honor in 2016 by the IAU.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him at number 72 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Influence==
The British band The Rolling Stones named themselves after Muddy Waters&#x27; 1950 song, &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;. Jimi Hendrix recalled that &quot;I first heard him as a little boy and it scared me to death&quot;. Eric Clapton was a big fan of Muddy Waters growing up and his band Cream covered &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27;&quot; on their 1966 debut album, &quot;Fresh Cream&quot;. Canned Heat also covered the song at the Monterey Pop Festival and later Bob Dylan played it on his album &quot;Modern Times&quot;. Many bands recorded &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; including The Allman Brothers Band, Humble Pie, Steppenwolf, Supertramp and Fear. The Led Zeppelin hit &quot;Whole Lotta Love has lyrics and a melody heavily influenced by the Muddy Waters hit &quot;You Need Love&quot; (written by Willie Dixon). Angus Young has cited Muddy as an influences and the AC/DC song &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; came from lyrics of his song &quot;You Shook Me&quot;, written by Dixon and J. B. Lenoir.

In 1981 ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons went to visit the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale with &quot;The Blues&quot; magazine founder, Jim O&#x27;Neal. The museum&#x27;s director, Sid Graves, brought Gibbons to visit Muddy&#x27;s original house, and encouraged him to pick up a piece of scrap lumber that was originally part of the roof. Gibbons eventually converted the wood into a guitar. Named Muddywood, the instrument is now exhibited at the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale. In 1993, Paul Rodgers released the album &quot;Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters&quot;, on which he covered a number of his songs, including &quot;Louisiana Blues&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot; in collaboration with guitarists Gary Moore, Brian May and Jeff Beck.

Following Muddy&#x27;s death, fellow blues musician B.B. King told &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be years and years before most people realize how greatly he contributed to American music.&quot; The bluesman John Hammond told &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;Muddy was a master of just the right notes. It was profound guitar playing, deep and simple ... more country blues transposed to the electric guitar, the kind of playing that enhanced the lyrics, gave profundity to the words themselves.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;The Anthology: 1947-1972&quot; on its list of greatest albums. They ranked him seventeenth on their list of the greatest artists of all time. Gibbons wrote: It was all supposed to be disposable. Just noise on a shellac disc. And here we are in the 21st century still trying to figure out how such a simple art form could be so complicated and subtle. It&#x27;s still firing brain synapses around the world. You&#x27;ve got the Japanese Muddy Waters Society corresponding with fans in Sweden and England, and his music can still propel a party in the U.S. He made three chords sound deep, and they are.

==In film==
Muddy Waters&#x27; songs have been featured in long-time fan Martin Scorsese&#x27;s movies, including &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, and &quot;Casino&quot;. A 1970s recording of &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; was used in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, &quot;Risky Business&quot;, and the rockumentary &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. In 1988 &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; was also used in a Levi&#x27;s 501 commercial and re-released in Europe as a single with &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; on the flip side.

Waters is a central character in the 2008 American biographical drama film 
&quot;Cadillac Records&quot;. The role of Muddy Waters is played by Jeffrey Wright. Wright recorded &quot;(I&#x27;m Your) Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; for the movie soundtrack.

<text>Stephen I of Constantinople (, &quot;Stefanos&quot;; November 867 – 18 May 893) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 886 to 893.

Born at Constantinople, Stephen was the son of Eudokia Ingerina and, officially, Emperor Basil I. However, at the time when he was conceived, Eudokia was the mistress of Emperor Michael III. Consequently, it is most probable that like his older brother Leo VI the Wise, Stephen was Michael&#x27;s son.

Castrated by Basil I, Stephen became a monk and was designated for a career in the church since his childhood. In 886, his brother, the new Emperor Leo VI, dismissed the Photius I of Constantinople and appointed the 19-year-old Stephen as patriarch in his stead.

As patriarch, Stephen I participated in the ceremonial reburial of Michael III by Leo VI in the imperial mausoleum attached to the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. There are no important events associated with Stephen I&#x27;s patriarchate and the patriarch, who acquired a reputation for piety, died in May 893 at the age of 25. His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is on 18 May.

<text>Nicholas I of Constantinople (&quot;Nicholas I Mystikos&quot; or &quot;Nicholas I Mysticus&quot;) (, &quot;Nikolaos I Mystikos&quot;; 852 – 15 May 925) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1 March 901 to 1 February 907 and from 15 May 912 to his death on 15 May 925. His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is 16 May.

Nicholas was born in the Italian Peninsula and had become a friend of the Patriarch Photius I. He fell into disfavor after Photius I&#x27;s dismissal in 886 and retired to a monastery. Emperor Leo VI the Wise retrieved him from the monastery and made him &quot;mystikos&quot;, a dignity designating either the imperial secretary or a judicial official.

On 1 March 901, Nicholas was appointed patriarch. However, he fell out with Leo VI over the latter&#x27;s fourth marriage to his mistress Zoe Karbonopsina. Although he reluctantly baptised the fruit of this relationship, the future Emperor Constantine VII, Nicholas I forbade the emperor from entering the church and may have become involved in the revolt of Andronikos Doukas. He was deposed as patriarch on 1 February 907 and replaced by Euthymius. Exiled to his own monastery, Nicholas I regarded his deposition as unjustified and involved Pope Sergius III in the dispute.

About the time of the accession of Leo VI&#x27;s brother Alexander to the throne on 11 May 912, Nicholas I was restored to the patriarchate. A protracted struggle with the supporters of Euthymius I followed, which did not end until the new Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos promulgated the &quot;Tomos of Union&quot; in 920. In the meantime, Alexander had died in 913 after provoking a war with Bulgaria, and the underage Constantine VII succeeded to the throne. Nicholas Mystikos became the leading member of the seven-man regency for the young emperor, and as such had to face the advance of Simeon I of Bulgaria on Constantinople. Nicholas I negotiated a peaceful settlement, crowned Simeon emperor of the Bulgarians in a makeshift ceremony outside Constantinople, and arranged for the marriage of Simeon&#x27;s daughter to Constantine VII.

This unpopular concession undermined his position, and by March 914, with the support of the &quot;magistros&quot; John Eladas, Zoe Karbonopsina overthrew Nicholas I and replaced him as foremost regent. She revoked the agreement with Simeon I, prompting the renewal of hostilities with Bulgaria. With her main supporter Leo Phokas the Elder crushingly defeated by the Bulgarians at the battle of Achelous in 917, Zoe started to lose ground. Embarrassed by further failures, she and her supporters were supplanted in 919 by the admiral Romanos Lekapenos, who married his daughter Helena Lekapene to Constantine VII and finally advanced to the imperial throne in 920. The Patriarch Nicholas I came to be one of the strongest supporters of the new emperor and took the brunt of renewed negotiations with the Bulgarians until his death in 925.

In addition to his numerous letters to various notables and foreign rulers (including Simeon I of Bulgaria), Nicholas Mystikos wrote a homily on the sack of Thessalonica by the Arabs in 904. He was a critical thinker who went as far as to question the authority of Old Testament quotations and the notion that the emperor&#x27;s command was unwritten law.

<text>Year 225 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Papus and Regulus (or, less frequently, year 529 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 225 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Roman Republic ====
* A coalition of Cisalpine Gallic tribes (Taurini, Taurisces, Insubres, Lingones, Salasses, Agones, and Boii), reinforced by large numbers of Transalpine adventurers called Gaesatae (Gaesati), invade Italy. Avoiding the Romans at Ariminum, the Gauls cross the Apennines into Etruria and plunder the country.
* To meet this invasion, the Romans call on the Insubres&#x27; enemies, the Adriatic Veneti, the Patavini, and the Cenomani, who rapidly mobilise defensive forces. These armies are placed under the command of consuls Lucius Aemilius Papus and Gaius Atilius Regulus. After the Battle of Faesulae (near Montepulciano) between the Gauls and a Roman army in which the Romans lose many men, the combined Roman forces succeed in outmaneuvering the Gauls and force the invaders towards the coast of Tuscany. Papus pursued and harassed their rear but did not risk a pitched battle. The other Consul, Regulus, had crossed from Sardinia, landed at Pisa, and was marching towards Rome. His scouts met the Celts&#x27; advance guard head on near Telamon (modern Talamone), in an area called &quot;Campo Regio&quot;.
* Battle of Telamon: The Romans, led by the consuls Gaius Atilius Regulus and Lucius Aemilius Papus, defeated the Celts led by the Gaesatae kings Concolitanus and Aneroëstes.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Seleucus III Ceraunus succeeds his father Seleucus II Callinicus as ruler of the Seleucid dynasty, and takes up the task of reconquering Pergamum in Anatolia from Attalus. However, Andromachus, the first general whom he sends, is decisively defeated and captured by Attalus.

==== China ====
* The state of Qin, its armies led by Wang Ben, conquers the state of Wei.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Seleucus II Callinicus, king of the Seleucid Empire (246-225 BC)
* Gaius Atilius Regulus, consul of the Roman Republic (Battle of Telamon).

<doc id="61861" wikidata="Q1100725" url="?curid=61861" title="Theophylact of Constantinople">
<text>Theophylact of Constantinople (or &quot;Lecapenus&quot;; , &quot;Theophylact Lekapenos&quot;; 917 – 27 February 956) was Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 2 February 933 to his death in 956.

Theophylact was the youngest son of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos and his wife Theodora. Romanos I planned to make his son patriarch as soon as Patriarch Nicholas I died in 925, but two minor patriarchates and a two-year vacancy passed before Theophylact was considered old enough to discharge his duties as patriarch (as he was still only sixteen years old). At this time, or before, he was castrated to help his career in the church. Theophylact was the third patriarch of Constantinople to be the son of an emperor and the only one to have become patriarch during the reign of his father. His patriarchate of just over twenty-three years was unusually long, and his father had secured the support of Pope John XI for his elevation to the patriarchate. Apart from the bastard eunuch Basil Lekapenos, who was appointed &quot;parakoimomenos&quot;, Theophylact was the only son of Romanos I to retain his high office after the family&#x27;s fall from power in 945.

Theophylact supported his father&#x27;s policies and pursued ecclesiastical ecumenicism, keeping in close contact with the Greek patriarchates of Alexandria and Antioch. He sent missionaries to the Magyars, trying to help the efforts of imperial diplomacy in the late 940s. At about the same time, Theophylact advised his nephew-in-law Emperor Peter I of Bulgaria on the new Bogomil heresy. Theophylact introduced theatrical elements to the Byzantine liturgy, something which was not universally supported by the conservative clergy around him.

Theophylact&#x27;s detractors describe him as an irreverent man primarily interested in his huge stable of horses, who was ready to abandon the celebration of Divine Liturgy in the Hagia Sophia to be present at the foaling of his favorite mare. Theophylact died after falling from a horse in 956.

<doc id="61865" wikidata="Q3568667" url="?curid=61865" title="William Grant Stairs">
<text>William Grant Stairs (1 July 1863 – 9 June 1892) was a Canadian-British explorer, soldier, and adventurer who had a leading role in two of the most controversial expeditions in the Scramble for Africa.

==Education==
Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the sixth child and third son of John Stairs and Mary Morrow, he attended school at Fort Massey Academy in Halifax, Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, as Student #52.

==Career==
After graduating as a trained engineer, Stairs spent three years working for the New Zealand Trigonometrical Survey in northern New Zealand. In 1885, he accepted the offer of a commission in the British Royal Engineers and trained in Chatham, England. In 1891 he transferred to the Welsh Regiment.

===Emin Pasha Relief Expedition===

Captain Stairs was appointed to the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition led by Henry Morton Stanley, at the time the most celebrated living explorer of Africa. Stairs sailed from London on 20 January 1887 and met Stanley in Suez on 6 February. Their expedition started from Banana at the mouth of the Congo River on 19 March and ended in Bagamoyo, Tanzania on 5 December 1889. Stairs was appointed second-in-command after Captain Barttelot was shot on 19 July 1888.

During the 5000 km journey across Africa through some of its most difficult country consisting of almost impenetrable rainforest and swamps, Stairs and colleagues suffered frequently from malaria and dysentery. Stairs had endurance, toughness and perseverance. He discovered one source of the Nile, the Semliki River, and became the first non-African to ever climb in the Ruwenzoris, reaching 10,677 ft before having to turn around. He was seriously wounded in the chest by a poisonous arrow during an attack by natives. Stairs recovered from his wound to continue the journey. In Dublin, Ireland there is a bronze plaque depicting this 13 August 1887 event on the statue of expedition Surgeon Major Thomas Heazle Parke who removed the arrow and sucked the poison from the wound.

The expedition was lauded in Europe and North America for exploits seen as heroic. On his return to England Captain Stairs was named a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1890.

He described the population as &quot;unfortunate blacks who, very often, are incapable of managing their own affairs.&quot;

==The Stairs Expedition to Katanga==

In 1891 on Stanley&#x27;s recommendation, Stairs was appointed by King Leopold II of Belgium to command a mission to take Katanga also known as Garanganze with or without the consent of its powerful king, Msiri. Leopold had used Stanley&#x27;s services before and agreed with his use of force and understood Stairs to be in the same mould, and he had a reputation for carrying out orders completely and without hesitation.

The Stairs Expedition was a military mission of 400 men under the Congo Free State flag, armed with 200 modern rifles. (Msiri&#x27;s men had muzzle-loading muskets). Stairs ran a well-organised expedition and won the loyalty of his officers and chiefs (Zanzibari supervisors). It was smaller and lighter than his previous expedition, with only two other military officers. They were in a race against Cecil Rhodes&#x27; British South Africa Company expanding from the south, which had already sent two failed expeditions to Msiri. Stairs and Joseph Moloney, the expedition&#x27;s British medical officer, were aware that they could potentially come into armed conflict with a British expedition, and agreed they would nevertheless discharge their duties to their employer, Leopold.

The Stairs Expedition became notorious for the fate of Msiri. After three days of negotiations without progress, Stairs gave Msiri an ultimatum to sign the treaty the next day, 20 December 1891. When Msiri did not appear, he sent his second-in-command, Captain Bodson to arrest Msiri, who stood his ground. Bodson shot him dead, and a fight broke out. The expedition took their wounded and Msiri&#x27;s body back to their camp where Stairs was waiting, and there they cut off Msiri&#x27;s head and hoisted it on a pole in plain view as a &#x27;barbaric lesson&#x27; to his people. Some of the Garanganze were massacred by the expedition&#x27;s askaris, and most of the rest fled into the bush.

Stairs handed over Msiri&#x27;s body to his two brothers and an adopted son, Makanda Bantu, whom Stairs installed as chief to replace Msiri, and who signed the treaty acknowledging Leopold as sovereign. The two brothers refused to do so until Stairs sent Moloney to threaten them with the same fate as Msiri.

Oral histories of the Garanganze people say that the expedition kept Msiri&#x27;s head – by some accounts in a can of kerosene – but it cursed and killed everyone who carried it and eventually, this included Stairs. He was ill with malaria throughout January 1892. After being relieved by another expedition, the Stairs Expedition set out on the long return journey to Zanzibar. Stairs was frequently sick but by May 1892 had recovered. On a steamer down the lower Zambezi he had another attack of malaria which killed him on 9 June 1892. He is buried in the European Cemetery in Chinde, Mozambique at the mouth of the Zambezi River.

Only 189 of the 400 men on the expedition made it back to Zanzibar, a year after they had left, most of the rest died and few deserted. Katanga became part of the Congo Free State, which was annexed by Belgium in 1908 after an international outcry over the killings, brutality and slavery by Leopold&#x27;s regime. In the early 20th century as Katanga&#x27;s mining industries developed, some British in Northern Rhodesia, representing the losers in the scramble for Katanga, thought of Stairs as a mercenary and traitor to the British Empire.

==Commemoration==

Captain Stairs is commemorated with three identical tablets (c. 1902) in the vestibule of Mackenzie Building at Royal Military College of Canada, St. George&#x27;s Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario) and in Rochester Cathedral near Chatham, England.
* &quot;William Grant Stairs, Captain the Welsh Regiment. Born at Halifax Nova Scotia 1 July 1863. Lieutenant Royal Engineers 1885–91. Served on the staff of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition 1887 under the leadership of H.M. Stanley and exhibited great courage and devotion to duty. Died of fever on 9 June 1892 at Chinde on the Zambesi whilst in command of the Katanga Expedition sent out by the King of the Belgians.&quot;
* A tablet at the Royal Military College of Canada Memorial Arch erected in 1932 &quot;The Emin Pasha Relief Expedition 1887–1890 52 Captain W.G. Stairs&quot;

A collection of artefacts from his African expeditions are at Fort Frederick (Kingston) and some his diaries are preserved in the Public Archives of Nova Scotia; others are lost.

Stairs Island, Parry Sound, Ontario was named in his honour.

Both Stairs Street and Stairs Place in Halifax, Nova Scotia, bear his name.

<doc id="61866" wikidata="Q58978" url="?curid=61866" title="Max Born">
<text>Max Born (; 11 December 1882 – 5 January 1970) was a German-British theoretical physicist who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his &quot;fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function&quot;.

Born entered the University of Göttingen in 1904, where he met the three renowned mathematicians Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann Minkowski. He wrote his PhD thesis on the subject of the stability of elastic wires and tapes, winning the university&#x27;s Philosophy Faculty Prize. In 1905, he began researching special relativity with Minkowski, and subsequently wrote his habilitation thesis on the Thomson model of the atom. A chance meeting with Fritz Haber in Berlin in 1918 led to discussion of how an ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen, which is today known as the Born–Haber cycle.

In World War I he was originally placed as a radio operator, but his specialist knowledge led to his being moved to research duties on sound ranging. In 1921 Born returned to Göttingen, where he arranged another chair for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck. Under Born, Göttingen became one of the world&#x27;s foremost centres for physics. In 1925 Born and Werner Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. The following year, he formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. His influence extended far beyond his own research. Max Delbrück, Siegfried Flügge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf all received their PhD degrees under Born at Göttingen, and his assistants included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Wolfgang Pauli, Léon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner.

In January 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, and Born, who was Jewish, was suspended from his professorship at the University of Göttingen. He emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he took a job at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and wrote a popular science book, &quot;The Restless Universe&quot;, as well as &quot;Atomic Physics&quot;, which soon became a standard textbook. In October 1936, he became the Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, where, working with German-born assistants E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, he continued his research into physics. Born became a naturalised British subject on 31 August 1939, one day before World War II broke out in Europe. He remained in Edinburgh until 1952. He retired to Bad Pyrmont, in West Germany, and died in a hospital in Göttingen on 5 January 1970.

==Early life==
Max Born was born on 11 December 1882 in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), which at the time of Born&#x27;s birth was part of the Prussian Province of Silesia in the German Empire, to a family of Jewish descent. He was one of two children born to Gustav Born, an anatomist and embryologist, who was a professor of embryology at the University of Breslau, and his wife Margarethe (Gretchen) née Kauffmann, from a Silesian family of industrialists. She died when Max was four years old, on 29 August 1886. Max had a sister, Käthe, who was born in 1884, and a half-brother, Wolfgang, from his father&#x27;s second marriage, to Bertha Lipstein. Wolfgang later became Professor of Art History at the City College of New York.

Initially educated at the König-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Breslau, Born entered the University of Breslau in 1901. The German university system allowed students to move easily from one university to another, so he spent summer semesters at Heidelberg University in 1902 and the University of Zurich in 1903. Fellow students at Breslau, Otto Toeplitz and Ernst Hellinger, told Born about the University of Göttingen, and Born went there in April 1904. At Göttingen he found three renowned mathematicians: Felix Klein, David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski. Very soon after his arrival, Born formed close ties to the latter two men. From the first class he took with Hilbert, Hilbert identified Born as having exceptional abilities and selected him as the lecture scribe, whose function was to write up the class notes for the students&#x27; mathematics reading room at the University of Göttingen. Being class scribe put Born into regular, invaluable contact with Hilbert. Hilbert became Born&#x27;s mentor after selecting him to be the first to hold the unpaid, semi-official position of assistant. Born&#x27;s introduction to Minkowski came through Born&#x27;s stepmother, Bertha, as she knew Minkowski from dancing classes in Königsberg. The introduction netted Born invitations to the Minkowski household for Sunday dinners. In addition, while performing his duties as scribe and assistant, Born often saw Minkowski at Hilbert&#x27;s house.

Born&#x27;s relationship with Klein was more problematic. Born attended a seminar conducted by Klein and professors of applied mathematics, Carl Runge and Ludwig Prandtl, on the subject of elasticity. Although not particularly interested in the subject, Born was obliged to present a paper. He presented one in which, taking the simple case of a curved wire with both ends fixed, he used Hilbert&#x27;s calculus of variations to determine the configuration that would minimise potential energy and therefore be the most stable. Klein was impressed, and invited Born to submit a thesis on the subject of &quot;Stability of Elastica in a Plane and Space&quot; – a subject near and dear to Klein – which Klein had arranged to be the subject for the prestigious annual Philosophy Faculty Prize offered by the university. Entries could also qualify as doctoral dissertations. Born responded by turning down the offer, as applied mathematics was not his preferred area of study. Klein was greatly offended.

Klein had the power to make or break academic careers, so Born felt compelled to atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became more interested in the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

On graduation, Born was obliged to perform his military service, which he had deferred while a student. He found himself drafted into the German army, and posted to the 2nd Guards Dragoons &quot;Empress Alexandra of Russia&quot;, which was stationed in Berlin. His service was brief, as he was discharged early after an asthma attack in January 1907. He then travelled to England, where he was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and studied physics for six months at the Cavendish Laboratory under J. J. Thomson, George Searle and Joseph Larmor. After Born returned to Germany, the Army re-inducted him, and he served with the elite 1st (Silesian) Life Cuirassiers &quot;Great Elector&quot; until he was again medically discharged after just six weeks&#x27; service. He then returned to Breslau, where he worked under the supervision of Otto Lummer and Ernst Pringsheim, hoping to do his habilitation in physics. A minor accident involving Born&#x27;s black body experiment, a ruptured cooling water hose, and a flooded laboratory, led to Lummer telling him that he would never become a physicist.

In 1905, Albert Einstein published his paper &quot;On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot; about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated to discover that Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked him to return to Göttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter&#x27;s project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.

A few weeks later, Born attempted to present their results at a meeting of the Göttingen Mathematics Society. He did not get far before he was publicly challenged by Klein and Max Abraham, who rejected relativity, forcing him to terminate the lecture. However, Hilbert and Runge were interested in Born&#x27;s work, and, after some discussion with Born, they became convinced of the veracity of his results and persuaded him to give the lecture again. This time he was not interrupted, and Voigt offered to sponsor Born&#x27;s habilitation thesis. Born subsequently published his talk as an article on &quot;The Theory of the Rigid Electron in the Kinematics of the Principle of Relativity&quot; (), which introduced the concept of Born rigidity. On 23 October Born presented his habilitation lecture on the Thomson model of the atom.

==Career==
===Berlin and Frankfurt===
Born settled in as a young academic at Göttingen as a . In Göttingen, Born stayed at a boarding house run by Sister Annie at Dahlmannstraße 17, known as El BoKaReBo. The name was derived from the first letters of the last names of its boarders: &quot;El&quot; for Ella Philipson (a medical student), &quot;Bo&quot; for Born and Hans Bolza (a physics student), &quot;Ka&quot; for Theodore von Kármán (a ), and &quot;Re&quot; for Albrecht Renner (another medical student). A frequent visitor to the boarding house was Paul Peter Ewald, a doctoral student of Arnold Sommerfeld on loan to Hilbert at Göttingen as a special assistant for physics. Richard Courant, a mathematician and , called these people the &quot;in group&quot;.

In 1912, Born met Hedwig (Hedi) Ehrenberg, the daughter of a Leipzig University law professor, and a friend of Carl Runge&#x27;s daughter Iris. She was of Jewish background on her father&#x27;s side, although he had become a practising Lutheran when he got married, as did Max&#x27;s sister Käthe. Despite never practising his religion, Born refused to convert, and his wedding on 2 August 1913 was a garden ceremony. However, he was baptised as a Lutheran in March 1914 by the same pastor who had performed his wedding ceremony. Born regarded &quot;religious professions and churches as a matter of no importance&quot;. His decision to be baptised was made partly in deference to his wife, and partly due to his desire to assimilate into German society. The marriage produced three children: two daughters, Irene, born in 1914, and Margarethe (Gritli), born in 1915, and a son, Gustav, born in 1921. Through marriage, Born is related to jurists Victor Ehrenberg, his father-in-law, and Rudolf von Jhering, his wife&#x27;s maternal grandfather, as well as to philosopher and theologian Hans Ehrenberg, and is a great uncle of British comedian Ben Elton.

By the end of 1913, Born had published 27 papers, including important work on relativity and the dynamics of crystal lattices (3 with Theodore von Karman), which became a book. In 1914, he received a letter from Max Planck explaining that a new professor extraordinarius chair of theoretical physics had been created at the University of Berlin. The chair had been offered to Max von Laue, but he had turned it down. Born accepted. The First World War was now raging. Soon after arriving in Berlin in 1915, he enlisted in an Army signals unit. In October, he joined the Artillerie Prüfungskommission, the Army&#x27;s Berlin-based artillery research and development organisation, under Rudolf Ladenburg, who had established a special unit dedicated to the new technology of sound ranging. In Berlin, Born formed a lifelong friendship with Einstein, who became a frequent visitor to Born&#x27;s home. Within days of the armistice in November 1918, Planck had the Army release Born. A chance meeting with Fritz Haber that month led to discussion of the manner in which an ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen, which is today known as the Born–Haber cycle.

Even before Born had taken up the chair in Berlin, von Laue had changed his mind, and decided that he wanted it after all. He arranged with Born and the faculties concerned for them to exchange jobs. In April 1919, Born became professor ordinarius and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics on the science faculty at the University of Frankfurt am Main. While there, he was approached by the University of Göttingen, which was looking for a replacement for Peter Debye as Director of the Physical Institute. &quot;Theoretical physics,&quot; Einstein advised him, &quot;will flourish wherever &quot;you&quot; happen to be; there is no other Born to be found in Germany today.&quot; In negotiating for the position with the education ministry, Born arranged for another chair, of experimental physics, at Göttingen for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck.

In 1919 Elisabeth Bormann joined the Institut für Theoretische Physik as his assistant. She developed the first atomic beams. Working with Born, Bormann was the first to measure the free path of atoms in gases and the size of molecules.

===Göttingen===
For the 12 years Born and Franck were at the University of Göttingen (1921 to 1933), Born had a collaborator with shared views on basic scientific concepts—a benefit for teaching and research. Born&#x27;s collaborative approach with experimental physicists was similar to that of Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich, who was ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics—also a prime mover in the development of quantum theory. Born and Sommerfeld collaborated with experimental physicists to test and advance their theories. In 1922, when lecturing in the United States at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Sommerfeld sent his student Werner Heisenberg to be Born&#x27;s assistant. Heisenberg returned to Göttingen in 1923, where he completed his habilitation under Born in 1924, and became a at Göttingen.

In 1919 and 1920, Max Born became displeased about the large number of objections against Einstein&#x27;s relativity, and gave speeches in the winter of 1919 in support of Einstein. Born received pay for his relativity speeches which helped with expenses through the year of rapid inflation. The speeches in German language became a book published in 1920 of which Einstein received the proofs before publication. A third edition was published in 1922 and an English translation was published in 1924. Born represented light speed as a function of curvature, &quot;the velocity of light is much greater for some directions of the light ray than its ordinary value c, and other bodies can also attain much greater velocities.&quot;

In 1925, Born and Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled &quot;Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen&quot; (&quot;Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations&quot;) to review, and submit for publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes corresponding to the initial and final states. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.

Up until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics. Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912, and Born had used them in his work on the lattices theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. With the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan, Born began immediately to make a transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg&#x27;s paper. A follow-on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors. The result was a surprising formulation:

:formula_1

where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; were matrices for location and momentum, and &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix. The left hand side of the equation is not zero because matrix multiplication is not commutative. This formulation was entirely attributable to Born, who also established that all the elements not on the diagonal of the matrix were zero. Born considered that his paper with Jordan contained &quot;the most important principles of quantum mechanics including its extension to electrodynamics.&quot; The paper put Heisenberg&#x27;s approach on a solid mathematical basis.

Born was surprised to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon, Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This had a great deal of appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.

In a letter to Born on 4 December 1926, Einstein made his famous remark regarding quantum mechanics: 
This quotation is often paraphrased as &#x27;God does not play dice&#x27;.

In 1928, Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics, but Heisenberg alone won the 1932 Prize &quot;for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen&quot;, while Schrödinger and Dirac shared the 1933 Prize &quot;for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory&quot;. On 25 November 1933, Born received a letter from Heisenberg in which he said he had been delayed in writing due to a &quot;bad conscience&quot; that he alone had received the Prize &quot;for work done in Göttingen in collaboration—you, Jordan and I.&quot; Heisenberg went on to say that Born and Jordan&#x27;s contribution to quantum mechanics cannot be changed by &quot;a wrong decision from the outside.&quot; In 1954, Heisenberg wrote an article honouring Planck for his insight in 1900, in which he credited Born and Jordan for the final mathematical formulation of matrix mechanics and Heisenberg went on to stress how great their contributions were to quantum mechanics, which were not &quot;adequately acknowledged in the public eye.&quot;

Those who received their PhD degrees under Born at Göttingen included Max Delbrück, Siegfried Flügge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf. Born&#x27;s assistants at the University of Göttingen&#x27;s Institute for Theoretical Physics included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Léon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner. Walter Heitler became an assistant to Born in 1928, and completed his habilitation under him in 1929. Born not only recognised talent to work with him, but he &quot;let his superstars stretch past him; to those less gifted, he patiently handed out respectable but doable assignments.&quot; Delbrück, and Goeppert-Mayer went on to be awarded Nobel Prizes.

==Later life==
In January 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. In May, Born became one of six Jewish professors at Göttingen who were suspended with pay; Franck had already resigned. In twelve years they had built Göttingen into one of the world&#x27;s foremost centres for physics. Born began looking for a new job, writing to Maria Göppert-Mayer at Johns Hopkins University and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University. He accepted an offer from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he wrote a popular science book, &quot;The Restless Universe&quot;, and a textbook, &quot;Atomic Physics&quot;, that soon became a standard text, going through seven editions. His family soon settled into life in England, with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley (Bryn) Newton-John and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively. Born&#x27;s granddaughter Olivia Newton-John was the daughter of Irene.

Born&#x27;s position at Cambridge was only a temporary one, and his tenure at Göttingen was terminated in May 1935. He therefore accepted an offer from C. V. Raman to go to Bangalore in 1935. Born considered taking a permanent position there, but the Indian Institute of Science did not create an additional chair for him. In November 1935, the Born family had their German citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless. A few weeks later Göttingen cancelled Born&#x27;s doctorate. Born considered an offer from Pyotr Kapitsa in Moscow, and started taking Russian lessons from Rudolf Peierls&#x27;s Russian-born wife Genia. But then Charles Galton Darwin asked Born if he would consider becoming his successor as Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, an offer that Born promptly accepted, assuming the chair in October 1936.

In Edinburgh, Born promoted the teaching of mathematical physics. He had two German assistants, E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, and one Scottish assistant, Robert Schlapp, and together they continued to investigate the mysterious behaviour of electrons. Born became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937, and of the Royal Society of London in March 1939. During 1939, he got as many of his remaining friends and relatives still in Germany as he could out of the country, including his sister Käthe, in-laws Kurt and Marga, and the daughters of his friend Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg. Hedi ran a domestic bureau, placing young Jewish women in jobs. Born received his certificate of naturalisation as a British subject on 31 August 1939, one day before the Second World War broke out in Europe.

Born remained at Edinburgh until he reached the retirement age of 70 in 1952. He retired to Bad Pyrmont, in West Germany, in 1954. In October, he received word that he was being awarded the Nobel Prize. His fellow physicists had never stopped nominating him. Franck and Fermi had nominated him in 1947 and 1948 for his work on crystal lattices, and over the years, he had also been nominated for his work on solid state physics, quantum mechanics and other topics. In 1954, he received the prize for &quot;fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function&quot;—something that he had worked on alone. In his Nobel lecture he reflected on the philosophical implications of his work:

In retirement, he continued scientific work, and produced new editions of his books. In 1955 he became one of signatories to the Russell-Einstein Manifesto. He died at age 87 in hospital in Göttingen on 5 January 1970, and is buried in the &quot;Stadtfriedhof&quot; there, in the same cemetery as Walther Nernst, Wilhelm Weber, Max von Laue, Otto Hahn, Max Planck, and David Hilbert.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Personal life ==
Born&#x27;s wife Hedwig (Hedi) Martha Ehrenberg (1891–1972) was a daughter of the jurist Victor Ehrenberg and Elise von Jhering (a daughter of the jurist Rudolf von Jhering). Born was survived by his wife Hedi and their children Irene, Gritli and Gustav. Singer and actress Olivia Newton-John was a daughter of Irene (1914–2003), while Gustav is the father of musician and academic Georgina Born and actor Max Born (&quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot;) who are thus also Max&#x27;s grandchildren. His great-grandchildren include songwriter Brett Goldsmith, singer Tottie Goldsmith, racing car driver Emerson Newton-John, and singer Chloe Rose Lattanzi. Born helped his nephew, architect, Otto Königsberger (1908–1999) obtain commission in the Mysore State.

==Bibliography==

During his life, Born wrote several semi-popular and technical books. His volumes on topics like atomic physics and optics were very well received. They are considered classics in their fields, and are still in print. The following is a chronological listing of his major works:

*&quot;Über das Thomson&#x27;sche Atommodell&quot; Habilitations-Vortrag (FAM, 1909) – The Habilitation was done at the University of Göttingen, on 23 October 1909.
* – Based on Born&#x27;s lectures at the University of Frankfurt am Main.
**Available in English under the title .
*&quot;Dynamik der Kristallgitter&quot; (Teubner, 1915) – After its publication, the physicist Arnold Sommerfeld asked Born to write an article based on it for the 5th volume of the &quot;Mathematical Encyclopedia&quot;. The First World War delayed the start of work on this article, but it was taken up in 1919 and finished in 1922. It was published as a revised edition under the title &quot;Atomic Theory of Solid States&quot;.
*&quot;Vorlesungen über Atommechanik&quot; (Springer, 1925)
*&quot;Problems of Atomic Dynamics&quot; (MIT Press, 1926) – A first account of matrix mechanics being developed in Germany, based on two series of lectures given at MIT, over three months, in late 1925 and early 1926.
*&quot;Mechanics of the Atom&quot; (George Bell &amp; Sons, 1927) – Translated by J. W. Fisher and revised by D. R. Hartree.
* &quot;Elementare Quantenmechanik (Zweiter Band der Vorlesungen über Atommechanik)&quot;, with Pascual Jordan. (Springer, 1930) – This was the first volume of what was intended as a two-volume work. This volume was limited to the work Born did with Jordan on matrix mechanics. The second volume was to deal with Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s wave mechanics. However, the second volume was not even started by Born, as he believed his friend and colleague Hermann Weyl had written it before he could do so.
*&quot;Optik: Ein Lehrbuch der elektromagnetische Lichttheorie&quot; (Springer, 1933) – The book was released just as the Borns were emigrating to England.
*&quot;Moderne Physik&quot; (1933) – Based on seven lectures given at the Technischen Hochschule Berlin.
*&quot;Atomic Physics&quot; (Blackie, London, 1935) – Authorized translation of &quot;Moderne Physik&quot; by John Dougall, with updates.
*&quot;The Restless Universe&quot; (Blackie and Son Limited, 1935) – A popularised rendition of the workshop of nature, translated by Winifred Margaret Deans. Born&#x27;s nephew, Otto Königsberger, whose successful career as an architect in Berlin was brought to an end when the Nazis took over, was temporarily brought to England to illustrate the book.
*&quot;Experiment and Theory in Physics&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1943) – The address given King&#x27;s College, Newcastle upon Tyne, at the request of the Durham Philosophical Society and the Pure Science Society. An expanded version of the lecture appeared in a 1956 Dover Publications edition.
*&quot;Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1949) – Based on Born&#x27;s 1948 Waynflete lectures, given at the College of St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford University. A later edition (Dover, 1964) included two appendices: &quot;Symbol and Reality&quot; and Born&#x27;s lecture given at the Nobel laureates 1964 meeting in Landau, Germany.
*&quot;A General Kinetic Theory of Liquids&quot; with H. S. Green (Cambridge University Press, 1949) – The six papers in this book were reproduced with permission from the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot;.
*&quot;Natural Philosophy Of Cause And Chance&quot;, Oxford 1949
*&quot;Dynamical Theory of Crystal Lattices&quot;, with Kun Huang. (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1954)
* Max Born &quot;The statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics&quot;. Nobel Lecture – 11 December 1954.
*&quot;Physics in My Generation: A Selection of Papers&quot; (Pergamon, 1956)
*&quot;Physik im Wandel meiner Zeit&quot; (Vieweg, 1957)
*&quot;Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light&quot;, with Emil Wolf. (Pergamon, 1959) – This book is not an English translation of &quot;Optik&quot;, but rather a substantially new book. Shortly after World War II, a number of scientists suggested that Born update and translate his work into English. Since there had been many advances in optics in the intervening years, updating was warranted. In 1951, Wolf began as Born&#x27;s private assistant on the book; it was eventually published in 1959 by Robert Maxwell&#x27;s Pergamon Press. – the delay being due to the lengthy time needed &quot;to resolve all the financial and publishing tricks created by Maxwell.&quot;
*&quot;Physik und Politik&quot; (VandenHoeck und Ruprecht, 1960)
*&quot;Zur Begründung der Matrizenmechanik&quot;, with Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan (Battenberg, 1962) – Published in honor of Max Born&#x27;s 80th birthday. This edition reprinted the authors&#x27; articles on matrix mechanics published in &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot;, Volumes 26 and 33–35, 1924–1926.
*&quot;My Life and My Views: A Nobel Prize Winner in Physics Writes Provocatively on a Wide Range of Subjects&quot; (Scribner, 1968) – Part II (pp. 63–206) is a translation of &quot;Von der Verantwortung des Naturwissenschaftlers&quot;.
*&quot;Briefwechsel 1916–1955, kommentiert von Max Born&quot; with Hedwig Born and Albert Einstein (Nymphenburger, 1969)
*&quot;The Born–Einstein Letters: Correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born from 1916–1955, with commentaries by Max Born&quot; (Macmillan, 1971).

<text>A Trombe wall is a massive equator-facing wall that is painted a dark color in order to absorb thermal energy from incident sunlight and covered with a glass on the outside with an insulating air-gap between the wall and the glaze. A Trombe wall is a passive solar building design strategy that adopts the concept of indirect-gain, where sunlight first strikes a solar energy collection surface in contact with a thermal mass of air. The sunlight absorbed by the mass is converted to thermal energy (heat) and then transferred into the living space.

Trombe walls may also be referred to as a mass wall, solar wall, or thermal storage wall. However, due to the extensive work of professor and architect Félix Trombe in the design of passively heated and cooled solar structure, they are often called Trombe Walls.

This system is similar to the air heater (as a simple glazed box on the south wall with a dark absorber, air space, and two sets of vents at top and bottom) created by professor Edward S. Morse a hundred years ago.

== History of passive solar systems and evolution of Trombe walls ==
In 1920s, the idea of solar heating began in Europe. In Germany, housing projects were designed to take advantage of the sun. The research and accumulated solar design experience was then spread across the Atlantic by architects such as Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Apart from these early examples, heating homes with the sun made slow progress until the 1930s, when several different American architects started to explore the potential of solar heating. The pioneering work of these American architects, the influence of immigrant Europeans, and the memory of wartime fuel shortages made solar heating very popular during the initial housing boom at the end of World War II.

Later in the 1970s, before and after the international oil crisis of 1973, some European architectural periodicals were critical of standard construction methods and architecture of the time. They described how architects and engineers reacted to the crisis, proposing new techniques and projects in order to intervene innovatively in the built environment, using energy and natural resources more efficiently.
Moreover, the depletion of natural resources generated interest in renewable energy sources, such as solar energy. 

Parallel to global population growth, energy consumption and environmental issues have become a global concern - especially while the building sector is consuming the highest energy in the world and most of the energy is used for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.

For these reasons, today&#x27;s buildings are expected to achieve both energy efficiency and environmental-friendly design through the use of renewable energy partly or completely instead of fossil energy for heating and cooling. In this direction, the integration of passive solar systems in buildings is one strategy for sustainable development and increasingly encouraged by international regulations.

Today&#x27;s low-energy buildings with Trombe walls often improve on an ancient technique that incorporates a thermal storage and delivery system people have already used: thick walls of adobe or stone to trap the sun&#x27;s heat during the day and release it slowly and evenly at night to heat their building. Today, the Trombe wall continues to serve as an effective strategy of passive solar design.

The first well-known example of a Trombe wall system was used in the Trombe house of Odeillo, France in 1967. The black painted wall is constructed of approximately 2 foot thick concrete with an air space and a double glazing on its exterior side. The house is primarily heated by radiation and convection from the inner surface of the concrete wall and the results from studies show that 70% of this building&#x27;s yearly heating needs are supplied by solar energy. Therefore, the efficiency of the system is comparable to a good active solar heating system. PV, Photovoltaic for electrical production converts 15%-20% radiation to energy. Meaning its energy efficiency is low - 85% of the sun&#x27;s radiation is lost. Whereas the solar thermal collector, Trombe Wall is able to convert 70%-80% of the suns radiation to heat, meaning, it is far more energy efficient and its heat production is powerful.

Another passive collector-distributor Trombe Wall system was built in 1970, in Montmedy, France. The house with living space required 7000 kWh for space heating annually. At Montmedy-between 49° and 50° North latitude-5400 kWh were supplied by solar heating and the remainder from an auxiliary electrical system. The annual heating cost for electricity was approximately $225 when compared to an estimated $750 for a home entirely heated by electricity in the same area. This yields to a 77% reduction in heating load and a 70% reduction in the cost for winter heating requirements.

In 1974, the first example of Trombe wall system was used in the Kelbaugh House in Princeton, New Jersey. The house is located along the northern boundary of the site to maximize the unshaded access to available sunlight. The two-story building has of thermal storage wall which is constructed of concrete and painted with a selective black paint over a masonry sealer. Although the main heating is accomplished by radiation and convection from the inner face of the wall, two vents in the wall also allow daytime heating by the natural convection loop. According to data collected in the winters of 1975-1976 and 1976–1977, the Trombe wall system reduced the heating costs respectively by 76% and 84%.

== How Trombe walls work ==
Unlike an active solar system that employs hardware and mechanical equipment to collect or transport heat, a Trombe wall is a passive solar-heating system where the thermal energy flows in the system by natural means such as radiation, conduction, and natural convection. As a consequence, the wall works by absorbing sunlight on its outer face and then transferring this heat through the wall by conduction. Heat conducted through the wall is then distributed to the living space by radiation, and to some degree by convection, from the wall&#x27;s inner surface.

The greenhouse effect helps this system by trapping the solar radiation between the glazing and the thermal mass. Heat from the sun, in the form of shorter-wavelength radiation, passes through the glazing largely unimpeded. When this radiation strikes the dark colored surface of the thermal mass facing the sun, the energy is absorbed and then re-emitted in the form of longer-wavelength radiation that cannot pass through the glazing as readily. Hence heat becomes trapped and builds up in the air space between the high heat capacity thermal mass and the glazing that faces the sun.

Another phenomenon that plays a role in the Trombe wall&#x27;s operation is the time lag caused by the heat capacity of the materials. Since Trombe walls are quite thick and made of high heat capacity materials, the heat-flow from the warmer outer surface to the cooler inner surface is slower than other materials with less heat capacity. This delayed heat-flow phenomenon is known as time lag and it causes the heat gained during the day to reach the interior surface of the thermal mass later. This property of the mass helps to heat the living space in the evenings as well. So, if there is enough mass, the wall can act as a radiant heater all night long. On the other hand, if the mass is too thick, it takes too long to transmit the thermal energy it collects, thus, the living space does not receive enough heat during the evening hours when it is needed the most. Likewise, if the thermal mass is too thin, it transmits the heat too quickly, resulting in overheating of the living space during the day and little energy left for the evening. Also, Trombe walls using water as a thermal mass collect and distribute heat to a space in the same way, but they transfer the heat through the wall components (tubes, bottles, barrels, drums, etc.) by convection rather than by conduction and the convection performance of the water walls differs according to their different heat capacities. Larger storage volumes provide a greater and longer-term heat storage capacity, while smaller contained volumes provide greater heat exchange surfaces and thus faster distribution.

== Design and construction ==
Trombe walls are often designed to serve as a load-bearing function as well as to collect and store the sun&#x27;s energy and to help enclose the building&#x27;s interior spaces. The requirements of a Trombe Wall are glazing areas faced toward the equator for maximum winter solar gain and a thermal mass, located 4 inches or more directly behind the glass, which serves for heat storage and distribution. Also, there are many factors, such as color, thickness, or additional thermal control devices that have an impact on the design and the effectiveness of Trombe Walls. Equatorial, which is Southward in the Northern Hemisphere and Northward in the Southern Hemisphere, is the best rotation for passive solar strategies because they collect much more sun during the day than they lose during the night, and collect much more sun in the winter than in the summer.
The first design strategy to increase the effectiveness of Trombe Walls is painting the outside surface of the wall to black (or a dark color) for the best possible absorption of sunlight. Moreover, a selective coating to a Trombe wall improves its performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass. The selective surface consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall and it absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range. High absorbency turns the sunlight into heat at the wall&#x27;s surface, and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass.

Although the Trombe walls are usually made of solid materials, such as concrete, brick, stone, or adobe, they can also be made of water. The advantage of using water as a thermal mass is that water stores considerably more heat per volume (has a greater heat capacity) than masonry. The developer of this water wall, Steve Baer, names this system “Drum Wall”. He painted the steel containers similar to oil drums and filled them almost full of water, leaving some room for the thermal expansion. Then stacked the containers horizontally behind an equator-facing double glazing with the blackened bottoms facing outside. This water wall involves the same principles as the Trombe walls but employs a different storage material and different methods of containing that material. Like the dark colored thermal mass of the Trombe walls, the containers that store the water are also frequently painted with dark colors to increase their absorptivity, but it is also common to leave them transparent or translucent to allow some daylight to pass through.

Another critical part of Trombe wall design is choosing the proper thermal mass material and thickness. The optimum thickness of the thermal mass is dependent on the heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of the material used. There are some rules to follow while sizing the thermal mass.

The optimum thickness of a masonry wall increases as the thermal conductivity of the wall material increases. For instance, to compensate for a rapid heat transfer through a highly conductive material, the wall needs to be thicker.

Accordingly, since the thicker wall absorbs and stores more heat to use at night, the efficiency of the wall increases as the conductivity and thickness of the wall increase.

There is an optimum thickness range for the masonry materials.

The efficiency of the water wall increases as the thickness of the wall increases. However, it is hard to notice a considerable performance increase as the walls get thicker than 6 inches. Likely, a water wall thinner than 6 inches is also not enough to act as a proper thermal mass that stores the heat during the day.

In the early Trombe wall design, there are vents on the walls to distribute the heat by natural convection (thermocirculation) from the exterior face of the wall, but only during the daytime and early evening. Solar radiation passing through the glass is absorbed by the wall heating its surface to temperature as high as . This heat is transferred to the air in the air space between the wall and the glass. Through openings or vents located at the top of the wall, warm air rising in the air space enters the room while simultaneously drawing cool room air through the low vents in the wall. In this way additional heat can be supplied to the living space during periods of sunny weather. However, it is now clear that the vents do not work well in either summer or winter. It becomes more common to design a half Trombe Wall then combine it with a direct gain system. The direct gain part delivers heat early in the day while the Trombe wall stores heat for the nighttime use. Moreover, unlike a full Trombe wall, the direct gain part allows views and the delight of winter sunshine.

To minimize the possible drawbacks of the Trombe wall system, there are additional thermal control strategies to employ to the wall design. For instance, the minimum 4-inch distance between the glass and the mass allows cleaning the glazing and the insertion of a roll-down radiant barrier as needed. Adding a radiant barrier or night insulation between the glazing and the thermal mass reduces nighttime heat losses and summer daytime heat gains. However, to prevent overheating in summers, combining this strategy with an outdoor shading device like shutter, a roof overhang, or an interior shading to block excessive solar radiation from heating the Trombe wall would be the best. Another strategy helps to benefit from the solar collection without some of the drawbacks of the Trombe walls is to use exterior mirror-like reflectors. The additional reflected area helps Trombe walls to benefit more from the sunlight with the flexibility of removing or rotating the reflector device if the solar collection is undesired.

When three different Trombe wall facades with single glass, double glass, and an integrated semi-transparent PV module are compared in hot and humid climate, the single glass provides the highest solar radiation gain due to its higher solar heat gain efficiency. However, it is recommended to use the single glass with a shutter for the evening and night times, to offset its heat losses. High transmission glazing maximizes solar gains of the Trombe wall while allowing to recognize the dark brick, natural stones, water containers, or another attractive thermal mass system behind the glazing as well. However, from an aesthetics perspective, sometimes it is not desirable to distinguish the black thermal mass. As an architectural detail, patterned glass can be used to limit the exterior visibility of the dark wall without sacrificing transmissivity.
The largest Trombe wall in the Northeastern United States is located in NJIT’s Mechanical Engineering Building, at 200 Central Avenue, Newark, NJ.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
=== Advantages ===
* Indoor temperature swings are 10 °F to 15 °F less with indirect-gain systems than with direct-gain systems. Trombe walls perform better at maintaining a steady indoor temperature than other indirect-gain heating systems.
* Among the passive solar heating strategies, Trombe walls can harmonize the relationship between humans and the natural environment and are widely used because of advantages such as simple configuration, high efficiency, zero running cost and so on.
* While passive solar techniques can reduce annual heating demand up to 25%, specifically using a Trombe wall in building can reduce a building&#x27;s energy consumption up to 30% in addition to being environmentally friendly.
* Similarly, the energy heating savings of 16.36% can be achieved if a Trombe wall was added to the building envelope.
* Glare, ultraviolet degradation, or reduction of night time privacy are not problems with a full-height Trombe wall system.
* As seen in the Trombe wall design and construction section, the performance of the Trombe walls is well characterized for a variety of design and climate parameters. Possible other modifications can be adding a rigid insulation board to the foundation area and insulation curtains between the glass and thermal mass to avoid heat transfer into the building during undesired periods or heat loss from the Trombe wall to the foundation, or adding a ventilation system into the wall system (if the wall has upper and lower vents) to provide an additional heat transfer by air convection which is desirable to circulate the air evenly.
* Energy delivery to a living space is more controllable than for a direct-gain system. It can be immediate through convection to satisfy daytime loads or delayed through conduction and re-radiation from the thermal mass’ inside surface to meet the nighttime loads.
* Multiple uses of solar energy components help greatly to reduce the overall labor and material cost of constructing a passively heated building.
* Roof ponds, as another passive solar heating strategy, do not work well with multistory buildings since only the top floor is in direct thermal contact with the roof. However, the Trombe walls can be the load-bearing structure of the buildings, so each floor&#x27;s equator-facing facade can take the advantage of the Trombe wall system.
* Compared to other passive solar systems, using the Trombe walls in commercial buildings with significant internal loads (people and electronic equipment) is useful because of the time lag involved in the transfer of energy through the wall into the space. Since the thermal mass reaches its capacity and becomes able to conduct heat in the evening hours, the space will benefit most by not causing potential overheating problems during occupied hours yet have little effect on heating costs if the building is not occupied after sundown.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Since the Trombe wall is consolidated in one building element - only the equator-facing facade - its impact on the overall building design is limited when compared to roof ponds or direct-gain systems.
* Natural daylight is lost in the full-height Trombe walls unless the system is combined with a direct-gain system or windows are introduced.
* Wall hangings or other type of coverings are not allowed on Trombe walls as they block the radiation emitted from the interior surface of the wall at night.
* The living spaces behind the Trombe walls need alternative access to natural daylight to prevent these spaces from being claustrophobic.
* If a Trombe wall is constructed with upper and lower vents, the upper vent on the thermal mass can suck the heated air from the warmer indoor spaces to the cooler air space between the mass and the glazing (reverse-siphon) at night. To avoid this, it is necessary to use back-draft dampers.
* In regions closer to the equator, although summer ventilation can help to ameliorate overheating, insulating and shading the Trombe wall can minimize this overheating during the hot season.
* It is a very climate-dependent system and external temperature and incident solar radiation levels have a significant role in the energy savings and emission reductions of Trombe walls. Even though Trombe walls built in hot-summer and warm-winter zones provide more energy savings per unit wall area compared to a conventional wall, they display a poorer economic performance if solar radiation is low during the heating season.
* The system requires user action to operate movable insulation or shutters, often on a daily basis.
* In regions where the local users are not familiar with the system, to get the maximum performance from the Trombe wall system, users can be given guidance either by modeling a prototype or providing a user-friendly operation manual for the wall during different seasons or days. This participation can lead to post-project acceptance of the Trombe wall idea and make it easier for locals to reproduce it locally.

=== Mitigating design variations ===
The Kachadorian floor overcomes the disadvantages of the Trombe wall by orienting it horizontally instead of vertically. The Barra system combines actual Trombe walls with a ventilated slab like the Kachadorian floor.

<doc id="61869" wikidata="Q132118" url="?curid=61869" title="Thiomargarita namibiensis">
<text>Thiomargarita namibiensis is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, coccoid bacterium found in South America&#x27;s ocean sediments of the continental shelf of Namibia. The genus name &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; means &quot;sulfur pearl.&quot; This refers to the cells&#x27; appearance as they contain microscopic elemental sulfur granules just below the cell wall that refract light creating a pearly iridescent luster. The cells are each covered in a mucus sheath aligned in a chain, resembling loose strings of pearls. The species name &quot;namibiensis&quot; means &quot;of Namibia&quot;. 

It is the second largest bacterium ever discovered, at in diameter on average, but can attain up to , making it large enough to be visible to the naked eye. &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; is nonpathogenic. 

&quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; is categorized as a mesophile because it prefers moderate temperatures, which typically range between 20-45 degrees Celsius. The organism shows neutrophilic characteristics by favoring environments with neutral pH levels like 6.5-7.5.

== Discovery ==
The species &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; was collected in 1997 and discovered in 1999 by Heide N. Schulz and her colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology. It was discovered in coastal sediments on the Namibian coast of West Africa. Schulz and her colleagues were off the coast of Namibia in search of &quot;Beggiatoa&quot; and &quot;Thioploca&quot;, two microbes which had previously been discovered off the South American Pacific coast in 1842 and 1906, respectively. They chose to conduct further research off the Namibian coast due to the similar hydrography of these coasts; both have strong and deep ocean currents which can stir-up various nutrients for the deep sea organisms to feast. Schulz&#x27;s team found small quantities of &quot;Beggiatoa&quot; and &quot;Thioploca&quot; in sediment samples, but large quantities of the previously undiscovered &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot;. Researchers suggested the species be named &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot;, which means &quot;sulfur pearl of Namibia&quot;, which was fitting as the bacteria appeared a blue-green, white color, as well as spheres strung together. The previously largest known bacterium was &quot;Epulopiscium fishelsoni&quot;, at 0.5 mm long. The current largest known bacterium is &quot;Thiomargarita magnifica,&quot; described in 2022, at an average length of 10 mm.

In 2002 a strain exhibiting 99% identity with &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; was found in sediment cores taken from the Gulf of Mexico during a research expedition. This similar strain either occurs in single cells or clusters of 2, 4, and 8 cells, as opposed to the Namibian strain which occurs in single chains of cells separated by a thin mucus sheath.

== Occurrence ==
&quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; was found in the continental shelf off the coast of Namibia, an area with high plankton productivity and low oxygen concentrations between 0-3 μM, and nitrate concentrations of 5-28 μM. &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; is most prevalent in the Walvis Bay area at 300 feet deep, but they are distributed along the coast of Namibia from Palgrave Point to Lüderitzbucht. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; is not found across the entire shelf, it is only found within a specific sediment type, diatomaceous mud, which is composed mainly of dead diatoms. Diatomaceous mud has high sulfate reduction rates and high levels of organic material. The most bacteria were obtained from the upper 3cm of sediment in the sample, with concentrations decreasing exponentially past this point. Here, &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; is easily suspended in moving ocean currents due to the sheath around the cells, which makes it easy for the bacteria to passively float. In this section of sediment, there were sulfide concentrations of 100-800 μM.

Although previously undiscovered, &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; is not uncommon in its environment. It is by far the most common benthos bacterium of the Namibian shelf, comprising almost 0.8% of the sediment volume. About 8% of the shelf with diatomaceous mud has free gases are present in shallow depths. When the gas is released from the sediment, sulfide is released into the water column. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; is more prevalent in areas with free gas, suggesting that the presence of suspended sulfide is beneficial to the bacteria. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; will oxidize the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from the sediment into sulfur and sulfide, thus allowing less sulfide into the water column and detoxifying the water. However, the supply of sulfide produced by the underlying sediment can be too much for the cell to oxidize all of it, and sulfide still enters the water column. The Namibian coastal environmental experiences strong upwelling, resulting in low oxygen levels with large amounts of plankton. The lower waters lack oxygen due to the multitude of microorganisms releasing carbon dioxide while they perform heterotrophic respiration to generate energy.

Since the &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; are immobile, they are unable to seek a more ideal environment when sulfide and nitrate levels are low in this environment. They simply remain in position and wait for levels to increase once again so that they can undergo respiration and other processes. This is possible because &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; have the ability to store large supplies of sulfur and nitrate. The organism also has a direct impact on its environment. Apatite, a mineral high in phosphorite, is correlated with the abundance of &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; through phosphogenesis. Internal polyphosphate and nitrate are used as external electron acceptors in the presence of acetate, releasing enough phosphate to cause precipitation. While the amount directly created by &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; cannot be calculated, it is a significant contribution to the large amounts of hydroxyapatite in solid-phase shelf sediment. The Mexican strain was primarily found in the top centimeter of sediment sampled from cold seeps in the Gulf of Mexico. The top 3cm of sediment from the Gulf of Mexico locations contained sulfide concentrations of 200-1900 μM.

== Physiology ==

=== Morphology ===
Although &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; are closely related to &quot;Thioploca&quot; and &quot;Beggiatoa&quot; in function, their structures are different. &quot;Thioploca&quot; and &quot;Beggiatoa&quot; cells are much smaller and grow tightly stacked on each other in long filaments. Their shape is necessary for them to shuttle down into the ocean sediments to find more sulfide and nitrate. In contrast, &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; grow in rows of separate single spherical cells, so they lack the range of motility that &quot;Thioploca&quot; and &quot;Beggiota&quot; have. &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; can also grow in barrel-like shapes. The cocci shaped &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; can join together to create chains of 4-20 cells, while the bacillus shaped &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; can form chains of more than 50 cells. These chains are not linked together by filaments, but connected by a mucus sheath. Each cell appears reflective and white as a result of their sulfur content.

Scientists did not previously believe these large bacteria could exist because bacteria rely on chemiosmosis and cellular transport processes across their membranes to make ATP. As the cell size increases, they make proportionately less ATP, thus energy production limits their size. &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; are an exception to this size constraint, as their cytoplasm forms along the periphery of the cell, while the nitrate-storing vacuoles occupy the center of the cell. These vacuoles make up most of the cell. As these vacuoles swell, the cell grows considerably which is the primary factor contributing to the record sizes of &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; cells. &quot;T.&quot; &quot;namibiensis&quot; holds the record for the world&#x27;s second largest bacterium, with a volume three million times more than that of average bacteria.

=== Motility ===
With their lack of movement, &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; have adapted by evolving the very large nitrate-storing bubbles vacuoles, allowing them to survive long periods of nitrate and sulfide starvation. Studies have shown that although there are no present motility features, the individual spherical cells can move slightly in a “slow jerky rolling motion,” but this does not give them the range of motion traditional motility features would. Other large sulfur bacteria found in the same sediment samples as &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; with different structures, such as &quot;Thioploca&quot; and &quot;Beggiota,&quot; have gliding motility. However, &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; cells do not have gliding motility due to their shape. The vacuoles give &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; cells the ability to stay immobile, waiting for nitrate-rich waters to sweep over them once again. These vacuoles are what account for the size that scientists had previously thought impossible, and account for roughly 98% of the cell volume. Because of the vast size of the liquid central vacuole, the cytoplasm separating the vacuole and the cell membrane is a very thin layer reported to be around 0.5-2 micrometers thick. This cytoplasm, however, is non-homogenous. The cytoplasm contains small bubbles of sulfur, polyphosphate, and glycogen. These bubbles give the cytoplasm a “sponge-like” resemblance.

As areas of nitrate and hydrogen sulfide do not mix together and &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; cells are immobile, the storage vacuoles in the cell provide a solution to this problem. Because of these storage vacuoles, cells are able to stay viable without growing (or dividing), with low relative amounts of cellular protein, and large amounts of nitrogen in the vacuoles. The storage vacuoles provide a novel solution which allows cells to wait for changing conditions while staying alive. These vacuoles are packed with sulfur granules that can be used for energy and contribute to their chemolithotrophic metabolism. The vacuoles of &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; contribute to their gigantism, allowing them to store nutrients for asexual reproduction of their complex genome.

== Size Adaption ==
Bacteria, on average, are significantly smaller in size than &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis.&quot; The smaller the size of a cell, the quicker it can reproduce and diffuse nutrients, and the higher the likelihood the biomolecule will almost immediately reach its site of activity. Despite the large size of &quot;T. namibiensis,&quot; its primary mechanism for nutrient uptake is still through normal diffusion. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; can perform normal diffusion due to the reduced amount of cytoplasm as a result of its large vacuoles. These large central vacuoles, which act as reserves, are the source of the large size of &quot;T. namibiensis&quot;. Because of its reserves, &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; can survive in its environment where nutrients are infrequently available. The reserves allow &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; to store the required nutrients to sustain the cell for extended periods of nutrient deficiency in its environment. Another adaptation advanced by the large size of &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; is its ability to survive without growing. Collected and stored sediment samples were found to have surviving &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; cells after over two years. The cells had no access to any added sulfide or nitrate during this time. In the surviving cells, there was a notable size decrease. To survive without growing the cells depended on the nutrient stores of the central vacuoles. The consistent reliance on the nutrient stores without replenishment caused the cells to lose size; however, the cells were able to continue surviving. The displayed durability of these cells reveals the impressive functionality of the large vacuoles in &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; cells. The storage capacity of these vacuoles can allow &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; cells to survive for prolonged lengths of time without access to nutrients.

== Metabolism ==
&quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; is chemolithotrophic and is capable of using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. Chemo refers to the way the microbe obtains its energy, which is done by using oxidation-reduction reactions of organic material. Litho defines an organism&#x27;s way of getting energy, which is done by using inorganic molecules as a source of electrons. This would be useful in an environment deficient in nutrients, such as soil or in an area with lots of sulfur. The final part of this metabolism characterization is how the bacterium obtains carbon, which in this case is done so in an autotrophic way. This means the organism uses carbon dioxide (CO2) from its environment as a carbon source and then synthesizes organic compounds from it. &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; uses what is known as the reverse or reductive TCA cycle to convert CO2 into usable energy. This adaptation shows how the bacterium has learned to survive in specific environments where usual metabolic pathways might not work well enough. There is still much unknown about the metabolism and phylogeny of the sulfur bacteria.

The bacterium is facultatively anaerobic rather than obligately anaerobic, and thus capable of respiring with oxygen if it is plentiful and without oxygen when it is minimal or absent. While not much is known about the exact metabolism the bacterium performs, it is known to exist in environments of high sulfur and little to no oxygen present. This bacterium often uses anaerobic respiration due to its environment not supplying ample oxygen. 

Sulfur oxidation is the main energy source for &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot;. Sulfide is the electron donor for this bacterium. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; will oxidize hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into elemental sulfur (S). This is deposited as granules in its periplasm. Nitrate is the electron acceptor in this oxidation-reduction reaction. Large amounts of nitrogen must be stored as a terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. The large vacuole mainly stores nitrate for sulfur oxidation. Because of this and the organism&#x27;s size, large amounts of sulfur are required which are stored as cyclooctasulfur. Both sulfide and nitrate are essential to the function of energy production in this bacterium.

Studies show that in some cases &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; can use oxygen as the electron acceptor in the oxidation of sulfur. However, this bacterium is predominantly located in environments of very minimal to no oxygen availability; therefore, nitrate will be the standard electron acceptor for the oxidation-reduction reaction. However, when oxygen is available in its environment &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; is able to utilize it as the electron acceptor in place of nitrate.

While sulfide is available in the surrounding sediment, produced by other bacteria from dead microalgae that sank down to the sea bottom, the nitrate comes from the above seawater. Since the bacterium is sessile, and the concentration of available nitrate fluctuates considerably over time, it stores nitrate at high concentration (up to 0.8 molar) in a large vacuole, which is responsible for about 80% of its size. When nitrate concentrations in the environment are low, &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; uses the contents of its vacuole for respiration. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; cells possess elevated nitrate concentrations giving them the capacity to absorb oxygen both when nitrate is present and when it is not. Thus, the presence of a central vacuole in its cells enables a prolonged survival in sulfidic sediments and nitrate starvation. This allows the bacteria cells to safely wait for shifts in environmental conditions. The non-motility of &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; cells is compensated by its large cellular size. This immobility suggests that they rely on shifting chemical conditions.

Cyclooctasulfur is stored in the globules of sulfur in the vacuoles of &quot;T. namibiensis&quot;, aiding in their metabolism. After the oxidation of sulfide, &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; stores sulfur as cyclooctasulfur, the most thermodynamically stable form of sulfur at standard temperature and pressure. With these sulfur globules in the cell, the organism uses it as storage of elemental sulfur in usually anoxic conditions to reduce the toxicity of various sulfur compounds (can also survive in atmospheric oxygen conditions as it is not toxic). The sulfur globules are stored in the thin outer layer of the cytoplasm, presumably after their use as a source of electrons in the electron transport chain through oxidation of sulfide. The ability to oxidize hydrogen sulfide provides nutrients to other organisms living near it.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; has an ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments due to stored nitrate and sulfur, which enables the cells to stay alive without reproducing. When the cells are unable to reproduce, most cells shorten to cocci or diplococcus arrangement. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; reproduces mainly through binary fission. Reproduction of &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; occurs on a single plane; the cocci (a spherical bacterial cell) divide into a diplococcus or streptococcus arrangement. A diplococcus is a pair of cocci cells that can form chains, and streptococcus is a grape-like cluster of cells. In the case of &quot;T. namibiensis&quot;, a diplococci structure is observed. Despite this, its cells remain connected, forming chains within a common mucus matrix. In addition to helping with essential functions including food exchange and cell-to-cell communication, this matrix can give the bacteria protection and structural support. During the process of binary fission, a single bacterial cell divides into two identical daughter cells, representing a comparatively basic form of asexual reproduction. The cells that make up the filamentous chain may then separate into smaller segments, and each of those segments may go on to produce a new filament. In a laboratory setting, the number of cells doubled over a period of 1 to 2 weeks when both nitrate and sulfide were available.

== Genome ==
&quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot; has a distinct genetic architecture because of its remarkable cell size and environmental niche. The DNA of &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; is dispersed over nucleoid areas situated under the cell membrane, in contrast to normal bacteria, which have a concentrated nucleoid. This peripheral design provides efficient cellular activities by lowering the distance over which chemical signals and metabolites must travel despite the huge cell volume. A whole genome sequence of &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; is unavailable because it is difficult to culture and extract sufficient DNA. However, &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; is polyploid, which means many copies of the genome are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. This genetic redundancy helped its metabolic requirements and improved its capacity to repair damaged DNA by environmental stresses. &quot;T. namibiensis&#x27;s&quot; genomic architecture is like that of other big bacteria, such as Epulopiscium fishelsoni. Both species have DNA distributed around the cell periphery to promote localized gene expression and effective cellular responses in big cells. This structure helps to overcome the constraints based on their size, allowing them to adapt quickly to environmental changes. The &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; genome is important because it is involved in biogeochemical cycles including sulfur and nitrogen cycling. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; is found in sulfide-rich, oxygen-poor marine sediments because of its gene involved in sulfur oxidation and nitrate reduction. Single-cell genomic investigations revealed that it has identified genes that might provide adaptability to dynamic redox circumstances. 

== Significance ==
&quot;T. namibiensis&quot; plays a vital role in the sulfur and nitrogen cycles. In their sulfur rich environment, oxygen is scarcely available and cannot be used as an electron acceptor. In turn, &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; uses nitrate as the electron acceptor, which they consume at the sediment surface and condense in a vacuole. From this, they can oxidize the toxic hydrogen sulfide that inhabits the sediment into sulfide. Therefore, &quot;T. nambiensis&quot; acts as a detoxifier that removes poisonous gas from the water. This keeps the environment affable for fish and other marine living beings as well as providing sulfide, a crucial nutrient for marine organisms. These bacteria also play an essential role in the phosphorus cycle of the sediment. &quot;T. namibiensis&quot; can release phosphate in anoxic sediments at high rates which contribute to the spontaneous precipitation of phosphorus-containing material. This plays an important role in the removal of phosphorus in the biosphere.

<text>Year 226 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Messalla and Fullo (or, less frequently, year 528 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 226 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* An earthquake destroys the city of Camirus and the Colossus of Rhodes on the island of Rhodes.
* The Spartan King Cleomenes III captures Mantinea and defeats the Achaean League under Aratus of Sicyon at Hecatombaeum, near Dyme in north-eastern Elis.

==== Roman Republic ====
* A formidable host of Gauls, some of them from across the Alps, threaten Rome.
* The Greek merchants of Massilia, frightened by Carthaginian successes in Spain (including their exploitation of the Spanish silver mines), appeal to Rome. Rome makes an alliance with the independent Spanish port city of Saguntum south of the Ebro River.
* The Romans send an embassy to Hasdrubal and conclude the Ebro Treaty which prohibits him from waging war north of the river Ebro, but allowing him a free hand to the south even at the expense of the interests of the town of Massilia.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Antiochus Hierax, brother of the Seleucid King Seleucus II manages to escape from captivity in Thrace and flees to the mountains to raise an army, but he is killed by a band of Galatians.
* Seleucus II dies after a fall from his horse and is succeeded by his eldest son Seleucus III Soter. At the time of Seleucus II&#x27;s death, the empire of the Seleucids, with its capital at Antioch on the Orontes, stretches from the Aegean Sea to the borders of India and includes southern Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Persia, and northern Syria. Dynastic power is upheld by a mercenary army and by the loyalty of many Greek cities founded by Alexander the Great and his successors. The strength of the empire is already being sapped by repeated revolts in its eastern provinces and dissention amongst the members of the Seleucid dynasty.

==== China ====
* The Qin generals Wang Jian, Li Xin and Wang Ben conquer western Yan and its capital Ji. To secure peace, king Xi of Yan executes his son Crown Prince Dan, who is wanted for the attempted assassination of the king of Qin, Ying Zheng.
*Lord Changping defects from the State of Qin and returns to his motherland in Chu. 
*That same year, ex-Han nobility launched a failed rebellion against the Qin Forces. But in the end they were crushed.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Antiochus Hierax, younger brother of Seleucus II, who has fought with him over the control of the Seleucid dominions in the Middle East (b. c. 263 BC)
* Lydiadas of Megalopolis
* Seleucus II Callinicus, king of the Seleucid kingdom from 246 BC

<text>Victoria Wood (19 May 1953 – 20 April 2016) was an English comedian, actress, lyricist, singer, composer, pianist, screenwriter, producer and director. Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions which she performed at the piano. Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to activities, attitudes and products that are considered to exemplify Britain. She was noted for her skills in observational comedy and in satirising aspects of social class.

Wood started her career in 1974 by appearing on, and winning, the ATV talent show &quot;New Faces&quot;. She established herself as a comedy star in the 1980s, winning a BAFTA TV Award in 1986 for the sketch series &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; (1985–87), and became one of Britain&#x27;s most popular stand-up comics, winning a second BAFTA for &quot;An Audience with Victoria Wood&quot; (1988). In the 1990s, she wrote and co-starred in the television film &quot;Pat and Margaret&quot; (1994), and the sitcom &quot;dinnerladies&quot; (1998–2000), which she also produced. She won two more BAFTA TV Awards, including Best Actress, for her 2006 ITV1 television film, &quot;Housewife, 49&quot;. Her frequent long-term collaborators included Julie Walters, Celia Imrie, Duncan Preston, and Anne Reid. In 2006, Wood came tenth in ITV&#x27;s poll of the British public&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Stars.

==Early life==
Victoria Wood was the youngest child of Stanley and Ellen &quot;Nellie&quot; Wood (&quot;née&quot; Mape). Stanley worked as an insurance salesman, who also wrote songs for his company&#x27;s Christmas parties, was the author of the musical play &quot;Clogs&quot; (based in a Lancashire village in 1887) and wrote part-time for &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and others. She had three siblings: a brother, Chris, and two sisters, Penny and Rosalind.

Wood was born in Prestwich and brought up in nearby Bury. She was educated at Fairfield County Primary School and Bury Grammar School for Girls, where she immediately found herself out of her depth.

Wood developed eating disorders, but in 1968, her father gave her a piano for her 15th birthday. She later said of this unhappy time &quot;The good thing about being isolated is you get a good look at what goes on. I was reading, writing and working at the piano all the time. I was doing a lot of other things that helped me to perform&quot;. Later that year, she joined the Rochdale Youth Theatre Workshop, where she felt she was &quot;in the right place and knew what I was doing&quot; and she made an impression with her comic skill and skill in writing. She went on to study in the Department of Drama and Theatre Arts at the University of Birmingham.

==Career==
===1970s===
Wood began her show business career while an undergraduate, appearing on the TV talent show &quot;New Faces&quot; in 1974. It led to an appearance in a sketch show featuring the series&#x27; winners &quot;The Summer Show&quot;. A further break came as a novelty act on the BBC&#x27;s consumer affairs programme &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; in 1976. She had met long-term collaborator Julie Walters in 1971, when Wood applied to the Manchester School of Theatre, then part of Manchester Polytechnic. Coincidentally the pair met again when they appeared in the same theatre revue &quot;In at the Death&quot; in 1978 (for which Wood wrote a brief sketch). Its success led to the commissioning of Wood&#x27;s first play &quot;Talent&quot; (in 1978), starring Hazel Clyne (in a role originally written for Walters), for which Wood won an award for the Most Promising New Writer. Peter Eckersley, the head of drama at Granada Television, saw &quot;Talent&quot; and invited Wood to create a television adaptation. This time, Julie Walters took the lead role, while Wood reprised her stage role.

===1980–1988===
The success of the television version of &quot;Talent&quot; led to Wood writing the follow-up &quot;Nearly a Happy Ending&quot;. Shortly afterwards she wrote a third play for Granada, &quot;Happy Since I Met You&quot;, again with Walters alongside Duncan Preston as the male lead. In 1980 she wrote and starred in the stage play &quot;Good Fun&quot;.

Recognising her talent, Eckersley offered Wood a sketch show, although Wood was unsure of the project: she agreed to go ahead only if Walters received equal billing. Eckersley came up with an obvious title – &quot;Wood and Walters&quot;, and the pilot episode was recorded. It led to a full series, featuring Duncan Preston and a supporting cast. In the period between the completion of the pilot and the shooting of the series, Eckersley died. Wood credited him with giving her her first big break, and felt that &quot;Wood and Walters&quot; suffered due to his death. She was not impressed by Brian Armstrong, his fill-in, and was of the opinion that he hired unsuitable supporting actors.

Wood appeared alongside 
Peter Llewellyn-Jones as an actor/presenter in Yorkshire Television&#x27;s 1984 schools television programme for hearing-impaired children, &quot;Insight&quot; - a remake of the series originally presented by Derek Griffiths. In 1982 and 1983 she appeared as a panellist on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Just a Minute&quot;.

In October 1983 Wood performed her first solo stand-up show, &quot;Lucky Bag&quot;, in a five-week run at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre in Islington. The show transferred to the Ambassadors Theatre for a 12-night run in February 1984. &quot;Lucky Bag&quot; went on a short UK tour in November and December 1984 and was also released as a live album recorded at the Edinburgh Festival in 1983.

Wood left Granada in 1984 for the BBC, which promised her more creative control over projects. Later that year her sketch show &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; went into production. Wood chose the actors: her friend Julie Walters once again starred, as did Duncan Preston. Wood&#x27;s friends Celia Imrie, Susie Blake and Patricia Routledge were in the cast. &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; featured the &quot;Acorn Antiques&quot; series of sketches, parodying the low-budget soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and rumoured to be named after an antiques shop in her birthplace. &quot;Acorn Antiques&quot; is remembered for characters such as &quot;Mrs Overall&quot; (played by Walters), the deliberately bad camera angles and wobbling sets, and Celia Imrie&#x27;s sarcastic tone as &quot;Miss Babs&quot;. One of Wood&#x27;s most popular comic songs, &quot;The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let&#x27;s Do It)&quot;, originated on this show. It tells the story of Freda (a woman eager for sex) and Barry (an introverted man terrified of intimate relations), and makes clever use of allusions to a multitude of risqué activities while avoiding all taboo words.

Following the success of the first series of &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot;, Wood went on tour again with &quot;Lucky Bag&quot; in March 1985. &quot;Scene&quot;, a documentary for BBC2 later that year, showed footage of Wood preparing for the tour.

A second series of &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; was made in 1986. Before filming began in the summer, Wood went on a short 23 date tour of England and Scotland during March and April. A final &#x27;Special&#x27; 40-minute episode of &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; was made in 1987 and broadcast later that year.

During autumn 1987 Wood went on the road with what was to be her largest tour yet. The tour included a sell-out two-week run at the London Palladium, and had a second leg in the spring of 1988.

In 1988 she appeared in the BAFTA-winning &quot;An Audience with Victoria Wood&quot; for ITV. At the time of recording the show she was six months pregnant. The end of 1988 saw the release of her second live performance &quot;Victoria Wood Live&quot;, recorded at the Brighton Dome.

===1989–1999===
During this period Wood moved away from the sketch show format and into more self-contained works, often with a bittersweet flavour. &quot;Victoria Wood&quot; (six parts, 1989) featured Wood in several individual stories such as &quot;We&#x27;d Quite Like To Apologise&quot;, set in an airport departure lounge, and &quot;Over to Pam&quot;, set around a fictional talk show.

In May 1990, Wood began a large tour of the United Kingdom, which was followed by a ten-week run at the Strand Theatre in London titled &quot;Victoria Wood Up West&quot;. Wood took the show on the road again during March and April 1991, where it was recorded at the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton, and later released as &quot;Victoria Wood Sold Out&quot; in 1991.

In 1991, she appeared on the Comic Relief single performing &quot;The Smile Song&quot;, the flipside to &quot;The Stonk&quot; (a record by ITV comedians
Gareth Hale and Norman Pace with charity supergroup The Stonkers). 
A UK number-one single for one week on 23 March 1991, the record was the UK&#x27;s 22nd-best-selling single of the year. However, even though it was a joint-single (with &quot;The Smile Song&quot; credited on the front of the single cover and listed as track 2 on the seven-inch and CD single rather than being a B-side), the UK singles chart compilers (now the Official Charts Company) did not credit her with having number one hit, in a situation similar to the fate of BAD II&#x27;s &quot;Rush&quot;, the AA-side of the preceding number one, &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; by The Clash.

She briefly returned to sketches for the 1992 Christmas Day special &quot;Victoria Wood&#x27;s All Day Breakfast&quot;, and also branched out into children&#x27;s animation, voicing all the characters for the CBBC series &quot;Puppydog Tales&quot;.

In April 1993, Wood began a seven-month tour of the UK. The 104-date tour broke box office records, including 15 sell out shows at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, and played to residencies in Sheffield, Birmingham, Plymouth, Bristol, Nottingham, Manchester, Leicester, Liverpool, Bournemouth, Oxford, Southampton, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leeds and Hull.

The television film &quot;Pat and Margaret&quot; (1994), starring Wood and Julie Walters as long-lost sisters with very different lifestyles, continued her return to stand-alone plays with a poignant undercurrent to the comedy.

In 1994, Wood starred in the one-off BBC 50-minute programme based on her 1993/94 stage show &quot;Victoria Wood: Live in Your Own Home&quot;. The special featured stand-up routines, character monologues and songs. An extended 80 minute version was released on VHS.

Wood set out on a 68-date tour of the UK in May 1996, which played at venues in Leicester, Sheffield, Ipswich, Blackpool, Wolverhampton, Bradford, Newcastle, Bournemouth, Brighton, Nottingham, Oxford, Southend, Manchester and Cambridge. The tour culminated with another 15 sell-out shows at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in the autumn. The tour recommenced in April 1997 in Liverpool and then travelled to Australia and New Zealand during the summer. It was later released as &quot;Victoria Wood Live 1997&quot;.

In October 1997, Wood released a compilation of 14 of her songs titled &quot;Victoria Wood, Real Life The Songs&quot;.

Her first sitcom &quot;dinnerladies&quot; (1998), continued her now established milieu of mostly female, mostly middle-aged characters depicted vividly and amusingly, but with a counterpoint of sadder themes.

===2000–2005===
December 2000 saw the Christmas sketch show special &quot;Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings&quot;, featuring her regular troupe of actors as well as a string of special guest stars including Hugh Laurie, Angela Rippon, Bob Monkhouse, Bill Paterson, Delia Smith and Roger Moore.

2001 saw Wood embark on her final stand-up tour, &quot;Victoria Wood at It Again&quot; but was postponed slightly by Wood having to have an emergency hysterectomy shortly before the tour was due to begin. She re-wrote the entire first half of the show and incorporated the operation into her act. The 62-date tour included 12 nights at the Royal Albert Hall and had a further 23 dates in 2002.

During this period, Wood tended to move away from comedy to concentrate on drama. She continued to produce one-off specials including &quot;Victoria Wood&#x27;s Sketch Show Story&quot; (2002) and &quot;Victoria Wood&#x27;s Big Fat Documentary&quot; (2005).

Wood wrote her first musical, &quot;Acorn Antiques: The Musical!&quot;, which opened in 2005 at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, for a limited period, directed by Trevor Nunn. It starred several of the original cast, with Sally Ann Triplett playing Miss Berta (played in the series by Wood). Wood played Julie Walters&#x27; lead role of &quot;Mrs Overall&quot; for Monday and Wednesday matinee performances.

===2006–2010===
Wood wrote the one-off ITV serious drama &quot;Housewife, 49&quot; (2006), an adaptation of the diaries of Nella Last, and played the eponymous role of an introverted middle-aged character who discovers new confidence and friendships in Lancashire during the Second World War. &quot;Housewife, 49&quot; was critically acclaimed, and Wood won BAFTAs for both her acting and writing for this drama; a rare double. The film also starred Stephanie Cole and David Threlfall as well as, in a small role, Sue Wallace with whom Wood had worked before and studied alongside at Birmingham.

In November 2006, Wood directed a revival production of &quot;Acorn Antiques: The Musical!&quot; with a new cast. The musical opened at the Lowry in Salford in December and toured the United Kingdom from January to July 2007.

In January 2007, she appeared as herself in a series of advertisements featuring famous people working for the supermarket chain Asda. They featured Wood working in the bakery and introduced a catchphrase – &quot;there&#x27;s no place like ASDA&quot;. Wood was the subject of an episode of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; in March 2007, and is the only woman to be the subject of two &quot;South Bank&quot; programmes (the previous occasion was in September 1996).

Wood appeared in a three-part travel documentary on BBC One called &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Empire&quot;, in which she travelled around the world in search of the history, cultural impact and customs the British Empire placed on the parts of the world it ruled. She departed Victoria Station, London, for Calcutta, Hong Kong and Borneo in the first programme. In programme two she visited Ghana, Jamaica and Newfoundland and in the final programme, New Zealand, Australia and Zambia, finishing at the Victoria Falls.

In a tribute to Wood, the British television station UKTV Gold celebrated her work with a weekend marathon of programmes between 3 and 4 November 2007, featuring programmes such as &quot;Victoria Wood Live&quot; and &quot;Dinnerladies&quot; and &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; – its first screening on British television since 1995.

Wood returned to stand-up comedy, with a special performance for the celebratory show &quot;Happy Birthday BAFTA&quot; on 28 October 2007, alongside other household names. The programme was transmitted on ITV1 on Wednesday 7 November 2007. On Boxing Day 2007 she appeared as &quot;Nana&quot; in the Granada dramatisation of Noel Streatfeild&#x27;s novel &quot;Ballet Shoes&quot;.

In December 2007, when a guest on the radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, Wood said she was about to make her first foray into film, writing a script described as a contemporary comedy about a middle-aged person. On Thursday, 12 June 2008, Wood was a member of the celebrity guest panel on the series &quot;The Apprentice: You&#x27;re Fired!&quot; on BBC Two. In June 2009, she appeared as a panellist on the first two episodes of a series of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

In 2009, Wood provided the voice of God for &quot;Liberace, Live From Heaven&quot; by Julian Woolford at London&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre. Wood returned to television comedy for a one-off Christmas sketch-show special, her first for nine years, &quot;Victoria Wood&#x27;s Mid Life Christmas&quot;, transmitted on BBC One at 21:00 on Christmas Eve 2009. It reunited Wood with Julie Walters in &quot;Lark Pies to Cranchesterford&quot;, a spoof of BBC period dramas &quot;Lark Rise to Candleford&quot;, &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; and &quot;Cranford&quot;; a spoof documentary, &quot;Beyond the Marigolds&quot;, following &quot;Acorn Antiques&quot; star Bo Beaumont (Walters); highlights from the &quot;Mid Life Olympics 2009&quot; with Wood as the commentator; parodies of personal injury advertisements; and a reprise of Wood&#x27;s most famous song &quot;The Ballad of Barry and Freda&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot;), performed as a musical number with tap-dancers and a band. &quot;Victoria Wood: Seen On TV&quot;, a 90-minute documentary looking back on her career, was broadcast on BBC Two on 21 December, whilst a behind-the-scenes special programme about &quot;Midlife Christmas&quot;, &quot;Victoria Wood: What Larks!&quot;, was broadcast on BBC One on 30 December.

===2011–2016===
On New Year&#x27;s Day 2011, Wood appeared in a BBC drama &quot;Eric and Ernie&quot; as Eric Morecambe&#x27;s mother, Sadie Bartholomew.

For the 2011 Manchester International Festival, Wood wrote, composed and directed &quot;That Day We Sang&quot;, a musical set in 1969 with flashbacks to 1929. It tells the story of a middle-aged couple who find love after meeting on a TV programme about a choir they both sang in 40 years previously. Although the characters are imaginary, the choir sang with the Hallé Youth Orchestra in Manchester&#x27;s Free Trade Hall on a record that sold more than a million copies. Apart from the pieces on the 1929 recording (Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Nymphs and Shepherds&quot; and the Evening Benediction from &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;) the score for the musical was written by Wood. She also narrated the 2012 miniseries &quot;The Talent Show Story&quot;.

On 22 December 2012, Wood was a guest on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Saturday morning &quot;Graham Norton Show&quot;. On 23 December BBC One screened &quot;Loving Miss Hatto&quot;, a drama written by Wood about the life of concert pianist Joyce Hatto, the centre of a scandal over the authenticity of her recordings and her role in the hoax. In April 2013, Wood produced a documentary about the history of tea named &quot;Victoria Wood&#x27;s Nice Cup of Tea&quot;. In 2013 she played retired constable-turned-security-guard Tracy in BBC Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Case Histories&quot; starring Jason Isaacs. She appeared in an episode of &quot;QI&quot;, broadcast on 13 December 2013, and around the same time made two return appearances on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; during the show&#x27;s 60th series in which she joined in the game One song to the tune of Another, singing the &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; theme &quot;Can We Fix It?&quot; to the tune of &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot;. In March 2014, Wood voiced the TV advertisement for the tour of the old set of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. On 5 December 2014 Wood was a guest on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;. On 26 December 2014, a television movie adaptation of &quot;That Day We Sang&quot;, directed by Wood, starring Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton, was shown on BBC Two.

In early 2015, Wood took part in a celebrity version of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; for Comic Relief and was crowned Star Baker in her episode. She co-starred with Timothy Spall in Sky television&#x27;s three-part television adaptation of &quot;Fungus the Bogeyman&quot;, which was first shown on 27, 28 &amp; 29 December 2015, her final acting role.

===Collaborators===
Wood was known for using many of the same actors in her projects, which comedian Tiff Stevenson later described as &quot;this core of people who she knew she worked well with, and why would [she] want to walk away from that?&quot; Duncan Preston said of these recurring appearances, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say that we were her favourite actors; I think we were like a company that she had.&quot; Celia Imrie commented that Wood&#x27;s &quot;team&quot; approach &quot;meant that we could work together very fast.&quot; An overview of these recurring cast members is shown below:

==Awards and recognition==
In 1979, Wood received the Charles Wintour Award for Most Promising Playwright at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards for her play &quot;Talent&quot;.

In 1997, Wood was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1997 Birthday Honours. Earlier in 1994, she was made an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Sunderland. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

In 2003, she was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Funniest Acts in British Comedy&quot;. In the 2005 Channel 4 poll the &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;, she was voted 27th out of the top 50 comedy acts by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. She was the highest-ranked woman on the list, above French and Saunders (who paid tribute to her in their &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; spoof, where a map of Middle-Earth shows a forest called &#x27;Victoria Wood&#x27;), Joan Rivers and Joyce Grenfell.

Her sketch show &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; won BAFTA awards for its two series and Christmas Special. In 2007, she was nominated for and won the BAFTA awards for &quot;Best Actress&quot; and for &quot;Best Single Drama&quot; for her role in the British war-time drama &quot;Housewife, 49&quot;, in which she played the part of a housewife dominated by her moody husband. Wood&#x27;s character eventually stands up to him and helps the WRVS (Women&#x27;s Royal Voluntary Service) in their preparations for British soldiers.

Her popularity with the British public was confirmed when she won &#x27;Best Stand-Up&#x27; and &#x27;Best Sketch Show&#x27; by &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers in 2001. Wood was also voted &#x27;Funniest Comedian&#x27; by the readers of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in 2005 and came eighth in ITV&#x27;s poll of the public&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Stars&quot;, four places behind long term regular co-star Julie Walters.

Wood was the recipient of six British Comedy Awards: Best stand-up live comedy performer (1990); Best female comedy performer (1995); WGGB Writer of the year (2000); Best live stand-up (2001); Outstanding achievement award (jointly awarded to Julie Walters) (2005); Best female TV comic (2011). Wood was nominated for the 1991 Olivier Award for Best Entertainment for &quot;Victoria Wood Up West&quot;.

===BAFTA nominations===
Wood was a 14-time BAFTA TV Award nominee, winning four. She received a special BAFTA at a tribute evening in 2005.

* &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; won the BAFTA for Best Entertainment Programme in 1986, 1987 and 1988; these awards went to the producer, Geoff Posner.
* &quot;An Audience With Victoria Wood&quot; won the BAFTA for Best Entertainment Programme in 1989; this award went to David G. Hillier.

==Personal life==
Wood married the stage magician Geoffrey Durham in March 1980. They had two children: Grace, born 1 October 1988 and Henry, born 2 May 1992. The couple separated in October 2002 and divorced in 2005, but continued to live near one another and were on good terms. Henry made a cameo performance as a teenager in &quot;Victoria Wood&#x27;s Mid Life Christmas&quot;. He also appeared in the accompanying &#x27;behind the scenes&#x27; programme &quot;Victoria Wood: What Larks!&quot;. Both children had already made appearances as extras on &quot;Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings&quot; in 2000.

Wood attended Quaker meetings with her husband and was a vegetarian, once remarking, &quot;I&#x27;m all for killing animals and turning them into handbags; I just don&#x27;t want to have to eat them.&quot;

==Death==
Wood received a diagnosis of esophageal cancer in late 2015, but kept her illness largely private. She died on 20 April 2016 at her Highgate home, in the presence of her children and sister Rosalind. Her funeral was conducted by a humanist celebrant at Golders Green Crematorium on 4 May 2016. A memorial service was held at St James, Piccadilly on 4 July 2016.

==Tributes==

On 15 May 2016, ITV broadcast &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It: A Tribute to Victoria Wood&quot;. In 2017, Wood was the subject of a seven-part show dedicated mainly to extracts from her TV and live work. The main series, titled &quot;Our Friend Victoria&quot;, aired on BBC One between 11 April and 9 May and concluded later in the year with a Christmas special on 23 December 2017. The seven episodes were presented by Julie Walters, Richard E. Grant, Michael Ball, Maxine Peake, The League of Gentlemen, Daniel Rigby and Anne Reid. On 17 May 2019, a statue of Wood was unveiled in her home town of Bury in Lancashire.

<doc id="61876" wikidata="Q187925" url="?curid=61876" title="Caraș-Severin County">
<text>Caraș-Severin () is a county (județ) of Romania on the border with Serbia. The majority of its territory lies within the historical region of Banat, with a few northeastern villages considered part of Transylvania. The county seat is Reșița. The Caraș-Severin county is part of the Danube–Criș–Mureș–Tisa Euroregion.

== Name ==
In Serbo-Croatian, it is known as &quot;Karaš Severin&quot;/Караш Северин or &quot;Karaš-Severinska županija&quot;, in Hungarian as &quot;Krassó-Szörény megye&quot;, in German as &quot;Kreis Karasch-Severin&quot;, and in Bulgarian as Караш-Северин (translit. &quot;Karash-Severin&quot;).

== Geography ==

With 8,514 km2, it is the third largest county in Romania, after Timiș and Suceava counties. It is also the county through which the river Danube enters Romania.

The mountains make up 67% of the county&#x27;s surface, including the Southern Carpathians range, with Banat Mountains, Țarcu-Godeanu Mountains and Cernei Mountains and elevations between 600 and 2100 meters. Transition hills between mountains and the Banat Plain lie in the western side of the county.

The Danube enters Romania in the vicinity of Baziaș, bordering Serbia. Timiș, Cerna, Caraș and Nera cross the county, some of them through spectacular valleys and gorges.

=== Neighbours ===

* Hunedoara County and Gorj County to the east.
* Timiș County to the north.
* Mehedinți County to the southeast.
* Serbia to the southwest:
** Vojvodina Autonomous Province to the west – South Banat okrug.
** Bor District and Braničevo District to the south.

== History and economy ==
In 1718 the county was part of the Habsburg monarchy, part of the province of Banat. In 1771 the county seat, Reschitz (Reșița) became a modern industrial center under Austrian rule. The area received considerable attention due to its mining industry. In 1855, the entire Banat area, with its supplies of mineral deposits and timber, was transferred from the Austrian Treasury to a joint Austrian-French mining and railroad company named StEG. StEG built the Oravița-Baziaș line, Romania&#x27;s oldest railroad track.

After World War I, StEG, Banat and most Austro-Hungarian property were taken over by a company named UDR. During the last years of World War II, when Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany, a partisan group, led by Ștefan Plavăț, was active in the mountainous area of the county. The arrival of the communist regime in Romania after World War II and that regime&#x27;s campaign of nationalization of the mining industry brought tremendous social upheaval in the area.

== Tourism ==
Archaeological findings show the area has been populated since Paleolithic times. There is a County Museum of History in Reșița, displaying archeological artifacts, and, in the town of Ocna de Fier, the Constantin Gruiescu Mineralogical Collection. The county hosts the regional daffodil and lilac festivals in the Spring.

<text>Reșița (; ; ; ; ; ; ) is a city in western Romania and the capital of Caraș-Severin County. It is located in the Banat region. The city had a population of 58,393 in 2021. It administers six villages: Câlnic (&quot;Kölnök&quot;), Cuptoare (&quot;Kuptore&quot;), Doman (&quot;Domány&quot;), Moniom (&quot;Monyó&quot;), Secu (&quot;Székul&quot;; &quot;Sekul&quot;) and Țerova (&quot;Krassócser&quot;).

== Etymology ==
The name of &quot;Reșița&quot; might come from the Latin &quot;recitia&quot;, meaning &quot;cold spring&quot;, as the historian Nicolae Iorga once suggested, presuming that the Romans gave this name to Resita, from a water spring on the Doman valley. A much more plausibile version, according to Iorgu Iordan, would be that the name is actually coming from a Slavic word: people living in the neighbouring village of Carașova 15  km away, referring to this place, that in those days was a similar village to theirs, as being &quot;u rečice&quot; (at the creek). It can also be noted that almost all Slavic countries have places with the name of Rečice (pronounced Recițe in Romanian).&lt;ref name=&quot;Începuturile Reșiței/Beginnings of Resita&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Historically, the town has its origins in the 15th century under the name of &quot;Rechyoka&quot; and &quot;Rechycha&quot;. Archaeological research found traces of habitation going back to the Neolithic, Dacian and Roman eras. It was mentioned in 1673 under the name of &quot;Reszinitza&quot;, whose citizens paid taxes to Timișoara, and by the years 1690–1700, it was mentioned as being part of the District of Bocșa together with other towns in the Bârzava Valley. The town was referenced to in the conscription acts of 1717 under the name of &quot;Retziza&quot;. On 3 July 1771, it became an important metal-manufacturing center in the region. The foundation of the industrial Reșița was laid with the establishment of factories near the villages of &quot;Reșița Română&quot; (&quot;Reschiza Kamerală&quot; or &quot;Oláh Resitza&quot;) and &quot;Reșița Montană&quot; (&quot;Eisenwerk Reschitza&quot;, &quot;Német(h) Reschitza&quot; or &quot;Resiczbánya&quot;). Reșița Montană was at first inhabited by Romanians, and later, in 1776, 70 German families settled there. Between 1880 and 1941, Germans were the dominant population in the city, with as many as 12,096 residing there in 1941, as opposed to 9,453 Romanians, and 1,861 Hungarians living there in that year. Between 1910 and 1925, Reșița had the status of a rural area, and in 1925, it was declared a town thanks to its development into a powerful industrial location in modern Romania. In 1968, it became a municipality.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Reșița lost most of its importance and its economy faced a drawback, along with the Romanian economy. The population also suffered a decrease, dropping from 110,000 in 1989 to 86,000 in 2006. After the fall of communism, the Reșița Steelworks (&quot;Combinatul Siderurgic Reșița&quot;, CSR) was bought by an American investor who brought the factory just one step away from bankruptcy. Today the steelworks are run by TMK Europe GmbH, a German subsidiary of OAO TMK, Moscow, which has projects of modernization for the CSR.

==The city==
The city is situated along the Bârzava River, which meets the Doman River in the centre of town. Most of the urban area is concentrated along the Bârzava, with some development—mostly residential—in the surrounding hills.

It is made of three main areas, two former villages that were very close: Romanian Reșița ( or Olah Resitza) and Highland Reșița (, Eisenwerk Reschitza or Nemet Reschitza); a new area, recently built, made of tower blocks on a wide opened meadow, called Bârzava&#x27;s Meadow.

The Civic centre of the city has been partially renovated in 2006. An important point of attraction located in the City Centre is the impressive kinetic fountain designed by Constantin Lucaci, built in the communist era.

There are also important cultural points in Reșița that have been renewed in 2006, including the Concrete School (Școala de Beton), Downtown, and the Polyvalent Hall (Sala Polivalentă).

The Reșița Steam Locomotive Museum features Romania&#x27;s first locomotive built in Romania at Reșița in 1872, and is located in the open-air museum in the () neighborhood.

An important iron and steel center, Reșița is the site of blast furnaces, iron foundries, and plants producing electrical appliances, chemicals and machinery (&quot;see Reșița works&quot;).

The city is a hub for leisure locations all around. Locations near Reșița include the ski resort at Semenic, Lake Gozna, Lake Secu, the Trei Ape Lake (Three Rivers Lake), Gărâna, Brebu, and Văliug.

Reșița has long been considered as the second-largest industrial center of Romania. It is an important center in manufacturing steel and vehicle manufacturing. C.S.R. (Combinatul Siderurgic Reșița) and U.C.M.R., the first Romanian factory (Uzina Constructoare de Mașini Reșița). The two are called as Reșița works and are the factories which sustained the city&#x27;s life for more than 300 years. The first factories were built in 1771, during the reign of Maria Theresa. During the 19th century, the steelworks were known as StEG. After the end of World War I, when Banat became part of Romania, they changed their name again, this time to Uzinele și Domeniile Reșița or UDR (Reșița Works and Domains). Only later, under the Communist regime, did the UDR split into CSR and UCMR.

The economy of Reșița has faced a drawback since 1989, but began recovering as a result of increasing foreign and domestic investment, largely in industry.

* Industry: Automobile industry, Iron industry, texture industry, civilian constructions.

* Tourism: 2 tourism societies (Tourist Semenic SA and BIRTA SA).

==Transport==

===Public transport===


Reșița&#x27;s public transport relies on 6 bus lines and was operated by the now defunct Prescom company. It is now operated by Transport Urban Reșița (TUR).

====Buses====

Reșița&#x27;s bus fleet consists of about 25 buses running on 6 lines:
*1M/2: Marginea – Minda – Mol/Mopar/Molizilor
*4: Moroasa II – Lend/Baraj (dam of Secu Lake) – CET – Molizilor – Moroasa II
*8: Intim – Moniom – Intim
*9: Intim – Țerova – Intim
*10: Nera – Doman – Nera

Reșița&#x27;s bus fleet was to be upgraded sometime during 2009, and after in 2017 when the Resita municipality took over the management of public transport.

====Trams====
A tram system, consisting of two lines, operated between 1988 and 2011 and is being restored.

The 2 tram lines were the Renk–Muncitoresc line (0), and the Renk–Stavila line (DP) which was basically an expansion of the Renk-Muncitoresc line, but there were only 3 trams on this line. The tram fleet consisted of about 28 trams. The last trams were GT8 and N models imported from Germany (Dortmund and Frankfurt), and completely replaced the former pre-89 trams in 2002. In 2008, the new mayor announced his intention to decommission all trams and replace them with modern buses complying with EU standards.

Reintroduction of trams was announced in 2016 and the modernization and expansion of the tram system began in 2019. The first phase involves 3.7 km double-track route with seven stops and a depot, the second phase will extend the system by and nine stops. In spring 2021, reopening was planned for December 2022, but was subsequently delayed, and as of October 2022 the completion of construction is forecast for December 2023, with reopening in 2024.

<text>Euphorbia is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, commonly called spurge, in the family Euphorbiaceae.

Euphorbias range from tiny annual plants to large and long-lived trees, with perhaps the tallest being &quot;Euphorbia ampliphylla&quot; at or more. The genus has roughly 2,000 members, making it one of the largest genera of flowering plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1007/BF00986147&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It also has one of the largest ranges of chromosome counts, along with &quot;Rumex&quot; and &quot;Senecio&quot;. &quot;Euphorbia antiquorum&quot; is the type species for the genus &quot;Euphorbia&quot;. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;.

Some euphorbias are widely available commercially, such as poinsettias at Christmas. Some are commonly cultivated as ornamentals, or collected and highly valued for the aesthetic appearance of their unique floral structures, such as the crown of thorns plant (&quot;Euphorbia milii&quot;). Succulent euphorbias from the deserts of Southern Africa and Madagascar have evolved physical characteristics and forms similar to cacti of North and South America, so they are often incorrectly referred to as cacti. Some are used as ornamentals in landscaping, because of beautiful or striking overall forms, and drought and heat tolerance.

Euphorbia all share the feature of having a poisonous, latex-like sap and unique floral structures. When viewed as a whole, the head of flowers looks like a single flower (a pseudanthium). It has a unique kind of pseudanthium, called a cyathium, where each flower in the head is reduced to its barest essential part needed for sexual reproduction. The individual flowers are either male or female, with the male flowers reduced to only the stamen, and the females to the pistil. These flowers have no sepals, petals, or other parts that are typical of flowers in other kinds of plants. Structures supporting the flower head and other structures underneath have evolved to attract pollinators with nectar, and with shapes and colors that function in a way petals and other flower parts do in other flowers. It is the only genus of plants that has all three kinds of photosynthesis, CAM, C3 and C4.

==Etymology==
The common name &quot;spurge&quot; derives from the Middle English/Old French &quot;espurge&quot; (&quot;to purge&quot;), due to the use of the plant&#x27;s sap as a purgative. The botanical name &quot;Euphorbia&quot; derives from Euphorbos, the Greek physician of King Juba II of Numidia and Mauretania (52–50 BC – 23 AD), who married the daughter of Anthony and Cleopatra. Juba was a prolific writer on various subjects, including natural history. Euphorbos wrote that one of the cactus-like euphorbias (now called &quot;Euphorbia obtusifolia&quot; ssp. &quot;regis-jubae&quot;) was used as a powerful laxative. In 12 BC, Juba named this plant after his physician Euphorbos, as Augustus Caesar had dedicated a statue to the brother of Euphorbos, Antonius Musa, who was the personal physician of Augustus. In 1753, botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus assigned the name &quot;Euphorbia&quot; to the entire genus in the physician&#x27;s honor.

== Description ==
The plants are annual, biennial or perennial herbs, woody shrubs, or trees with a caustic, poisonous milky latex. The roots are fine or thick and fleshy or tuberous. Many species are more or less succulent, thorny, or unarmed. The main stem and mostly also the side arms of the succulent species are thick and fleshy, and often winged, tall. The succulent trees and large shrubs are mostly confined to southern and eastern Africa, but Euphorbia neutra is native to the Caatinga of Brazil and Euphorbia royleana is found in the Himalayan foothills. The deciduous leaves may be opposite, alternate, or in whorls. In succulent species, the leaves are mostly small and short-lived. The stipules are mostly small, partly transformed into spines or glands, or missing.

===Inflorescence and fruit===

Like all members of the family Euphorbiaceae, spurges have unisexual flowers.

In &quot;Euphorbia&quot;, flowers occur in a head, called the cyathium (plural cyathia). Each male or female flower in the cyathium head has only its essential sexual part, in males the stamen, and in females the pistil. The flowers do not have sepals, petals, or nectar to attract pollinators, although other nonflower parts of the plant have an appearance and nectar glands with similar roles. Euphorbias are the only plants known to have this kind of flower head.

Nectar glands and nectar that attract pollinators are held in the involucre, a cup-like part below and supporting the cyathium head. The &quot;involucre&quot; in the genus &quot;Euphorbia&quot; is not to be confused with the &quot;involucre&quot; in family Asteraceae members, which is a collection of bracts called phyllaries, which surround and encase the unopened flower head, then support the receptacle under it after the flower head opens.

The involucre is above and supported by bract-like modified leaf structures (usually in pairs) called cyathophylls&#x27;, or cyathial leaves. The cyathophyll often has a superficial appearance of being petals of a flower.

&quot;Euphorbia&quot; flowers are tiny, and the variation attracting different pollinators, with different forms and colors occurs, in the cyathium, involucre, cyathophyll, or additional parts such as glands that attached to these.

The collection of many flowers may be shaped and arranged to appear collectively as a single individual flower, sometimes called a pseudanthium in the Asteraceae, and also in &quot;Euphorbia&quot;.

The majority of species are monoecious (bearing male and female flowers on the same plant), although some are dioecious with male and female flowers occurring on different plants. It is not unusual for the central cyathia of a cyme to be purely male, and for lateral cyathia to carry both sexes. Sometimes, young plants or those growing under unfavorable conditions are male only, and only produce female flowers in the cyathia with maturity or as growing conditions improve.

The female flowers reduced to a single pistil usually split into three parts, often with two stigmas at each tip. Male flowers often have anthers in twos. Nectar glands usually occur in fives, may be as few as one, and may be fused into a &quot;U&quot; shape. The cyathophylls often occur in twos, are leaf-like, and may be showy and brightly coloured and attractive to pollinators, or be reduced to barely visible tiny scales.

The fruits are three- or rarely two-compartment capsules, sometimes fleshy, but almost always ripening to a woody container that then splits open, sometimes explosively. The seeds are four-angled, oval, or spherical, and some species have a caruncle.

===Xerophytes and succulents===
In the genus &quot;Euphorbia&quot;, succulence in the species has often evolved divergently and to differing degrees. Sometimes, it is difficult to decide, and is a question of interpretation, whether or not a species is really succulent or &quot;only&quot; xerophytic. In some cases, especially with geophytes, plants closely related to the succulents are normal herbs. About 850 species are succulent in the strictest sense. If one includes slightly succulent and xerophytic species, this figure rises to about 1000, representing about 45% of all &quot;Euphorbia&quot; species.

=== Irritants ===
The milky sap of spurges (called &quot;latex&quot;) evolved as a deterrent to herbivores. It is white, and transparent when dry, except in &quot;E. abdelkuri&quot;, where it is yellow. The pressurized sap seeps from the slightest wound and congeals after a few minutes in air. The skin-irritating and caustic effects are largely caused by varying amounts of diterpenes. Triterpenes such as betulin and corresponding esters are other major components of the latex. In contact with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth), the latex can produce extremely painful inflammation. The sap has also been known to cause mild to extreme Keratouveitis, which affects vision. Therefore, spurges should be handled with caution and kept away from children and pets. Wearing eye protection while working in close contact with &quot;Euphorbia&quot; is advised. Latex on skin should be washed off immediately and thoroughly. Congealed latex is insoluble in water, but can be removed with an emulsifier such as milk or soap. A physician should be consulted if inflammation occurs, as severe eye damage including permanent blindness may result from exposure to the sap.

The poisonous qualities were well known: in the Ethiopian &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;, the serpent king Arwe is killed with juice from the &quot;Euphorbia&quot;.

===Uses===

Several spurges are grown as garden plants, among them poinsettia (&quot;E. pulcherrima&quot;) and the succulent &quot;E. trigona&quot;. &quot;E. pekinensis&quot; () is used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is regarded as one of the 50 fundamental herbs. Several &quot;Euphorbia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), like the spurge hawkmoths (&quot;Hyles euphorbiae&quot; and &quot;Hyles tithymali&quot;), as well as the giant leopard moth.

Ingenol mebutate, a drug used to treat actinic keratosis, is a diterpenoid found in &quot;Euphorbia peplus&quot;.

Euphorbias are often used as hedging plants in many parts of Africa.

===Misidentification as cacti===

Among laypeople, &quot;Euphorbia&quot; species are among the plant taxa most commonly confused with cacti, especially the stem succulents. Euphorbias secrete a sticky, milky-white fluid with latex, but cacti do not. Individual flowers of euphorbias are usually tiny and nondescript (although structures around the individual flowers may not be), without petals and sepals, unlike cacti, which often have fantastically showy flowers.

== Systematics and taxonomy ==
The present taxon &quot;Euphorbia&quot; corresponds to its own former subtribe, the Euphorbiinae. It has over 2000 species. Morphological description using the presence of a cyathium (see section above) is consistent with nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence data in testing of about 10% of its members. This testing supports inclusion of formerly other genera as being best placed in this single genus, including &quot;Chamaesyce, Monadenium, Pedilanthus&quot;, and poinsettia (&quot;E. pulcherrima&quot;).

Genetic tests have shown that similar flower head structures or forms within the genus, might not mean close ancestry within the genus. The genetic data show that within the genus, convergent evolution of inflorescence structures may be from ancestral subunits that are not related. So using morphology within the genus becomes problematic for further subgeneric grouping. As stated on the Euphorbia Planetary Biodiversity Inventory project webpage:
According to a 2002 publication on studies of DNA sequence data, most of the smaller &quot;satellite genera&quot; around the huge genus &quot;Euphorbia&quot; nest deep within the latter. Consequently, these taxa, namely the never generally accepted genus &quot;Chamaesyce&quot;, as well as the smaller genera &quot;Cubanthus&quot;, &quot;Elaeophorbia&quot;, &quot;Endadenium&quot;, &quot;Monadenium&quot;, &quot;Synadenium&quot;,
and &quot;Pedilanthus&quot; were transferred to &quot;Euphorbia&quot;. The entire subtribe Euphorbiinae now consists solely of the genus &quot;Euphorbia&quot;.

===Hybrids===
&quot;Euphorbia&quot; has been extensively hybridised for garden use, with many cultivars available commercially. Moreover, some hybrid plants have been found growing in the wild, for instance &quot;E.&quot; × &quot;martini&quot; Rouy, a cross of &quot;E. amygdaloides&quot; × &quot;E. characias&quot; subsp. &quot;characias&quot;, found in southern France.

=== Subgenera ===
The genus &quot;Euphorbia&quot; is one of the largest and most complex genera of flowering plants, and several botanists have made unsuccessful attempts to subdivide the genus into numerous smaller genera. According to the recent phylogenetic studies, &quot;Euphorbia&quot; can be divided into four subgenera, each containing several sections and groups. Of these, subgenus &quot;Esula&quot; is the most basal. The subgenera &quot;Chamaesyce&quot; and &quot;Euphorbia&quot; are probably sister taxa, but very closely related to subgenus &quot;Rhizanthium&quot;. Extensive xeromorph adaptations in all probability evolved several times; it is not known if the common ancestor of the cactus-like &quot;Rhizanthium&quot; and &quot;Euphorbia&quot; lineages had been xeromorphic—in which case a more normal morphology would have re-evolved namely in &quot;Chamaesyce&quot;—or whether extensive xeromorphism is entirely polyphyletic even to the level of the subgenera.

<text>Louis XVII (born Louis Charles, Duke of Normandy; 27 March 1785 – 8 June 1795) was the younger son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. His older brother, Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. At his brother&#x27;s death he became the new Dauphin (heir apparent to the throne), a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the title of Prince Royal.

When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle period of the French Revolution, he automatically succeeded as King of France, Louis XVII, in the eyes of the royalists. France was by then a republic, and since Louis-Charles was imprisoned and died in captivity in June 1795, he never actually ruled. Nevertheless, in 1814 after the Bourbon Restoration, his uncle acceded to the throne and was proclaimed Louis XVIII.

==Biography==

Louis-Charles de France was born at the Palace of Versailles, the second son and third child of his parents, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. He was named after his father and his mother&#x27;s favourite sister Maria Carolina, Queen of Naples and Sicily, who was known as Charlotte in the family, Charles being the masculine version of her name. His younger sister, Sophie, was born a little over a year later. He became the Dauphin on the death of his elder brother, Louis Joseph, on 4 June 1789.

As customary in royal families, Louis-Charles was cared for by multiple people. Queen Marie Antoinette appointed governesses to look after all three of her children. Louis-Charles&#x27; original governess was Yolande de Polastron, Duchess of Polignac, who left France on the night of 16–17 July 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, at the urging of Louis XVI. She was replaced by the marquise Louise Élisabeth de Tourzel. Additionally, the queen selected Agathe de Rambaud to be the official nurse of Louis-Charles. Alain Decaux wrote: &quot;Madame de Rambaud was officially in charge of the care of the prince from the day of his birth until 10 August 1792; in other words, for seven years. During these seven years, she never left him, she cradled him, took care of him, dressed him, comforted him, and scolded him. Many times, more than Marie Antoinette, she was a true mother for him&quot;.

Some have suggested that Axel von Fersen, who was romantically linked with Marie Antoinette, was the father of her son. The fact that Louis Charles was born exactly nine months after he returned to court was noted, but this theory was debunked by most scholars, who reject it, observing that the time of his conception corresponded to a time that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had spent a lot of time together. The king wrote in his diary about the birth as &quot;when my son was born&quot;. Marie Antoinette reportedly retained her charisma after her pregnancies, cutting an imposing figure in her court. She was said to have many admirers, but remained a faithful, strong-willed wife and a stern but ultimately loving mother.

On 6 October 1789, the royal family was forced by a Parisian mob mostly composed of women to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they spent the next three years as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the National Guards who did not spare any humiliation to the family; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children.

The family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the prisoner. In 1790, the queen adopted a foster sibling for him, &quot;Zoë&quot; Jeanne Louise Victoire, as a playmate. On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in what is known as the Flight to Varennes, but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on 10 August 1792, the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.

On 13 August, the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the Temple. At first, their conditions were not extremely harsh, but they were prisoners and were re-styled as the &quot;Capets&quot; by the newborn Republic. On 11 December, at the beginning of his trial, Louis XVI was separated from his family.

===Naming===
At his birth, Louis-Charles, a &quot;Fils de France&quot; (&quot;Son of France&quot;), was given the title of Duke of Normandy, and, on 4 June 1789, when Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, his elder brother, died, the four-year-old became Dauphin of France, a title he held until September 1791, when France became a constitutional monarchy. Under the new constitution, the heir-apparent to the throne of France, formerly referred to as the &quot;Dauphin&quot;, was restyled the &quot;Prince Royal&quot;. Louis-Charles held that title until the fall of the monarchy on 21 September 1792. At the death of his father on 21 January 1793, royalists and foreign powers intent on restoring the monarchy held him to be the new king of France, with the title of Louis XVII. From his exile in Hamm, in today&#x27;s North Rhine-Westphalia, his uncle, the Count of Provence and future Louis XVIII, who had emigrated on 21 June 1791, appointed himself Regent for the young imprisoned king.

===Prison and rumours of escape===
====1793: In the care of Antoine Simon====

Immediately following Louis XVI&#x27;s execution, plots were hatched for the escape of the prisoners from the Temple, the chief of these plots were engineered by the , the Baron de Batz, and Lady Atkyns. Others said to be involved in his escape(s) are Paul Barras and Joséphine de Beauharnais.

On 3 July, Louis-Charles was separated from his mother and put in the care of Antoine Simon, a cobbler who had been named his guardian by the Committee of Public Safety. The tales told by royalist writers of the cruelty inflicted by Simon and his wife on the child have not been proved. Louis Charles&#x27; sister, Marie Thérèse, wrote in her memoires about the &quot;monster Simon&quot;, as did Alcide Beauchesne. Antoine Simon&#x27;s wife Marie-Jeanne, in fact, took great care of the child&#x27;s person. Stories survive narrating how he was encouraged to eat and drink to excess and learned the language of the gutter. The foreign secretaries of Britain and Spain also heard accounts from their spies that the boy was raped by prostitutes in order to infect him with venereal diseases to supply the Commune with manufactured &quot;evidence&quot; against the Queen. However, the scenes related by of the physical torment of the child are not supported by any testimony, though he was at this time seen by a great number of people.

On 6 October, Pache, Chaumette, Jacques Hébert and others visited the boy and secured his signature to charges of sexual molestation against his mother and his aunt. The next day he met his elder sister Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte for the last time.

====1794: Illness====
On 19 January 1794, the Simons left the Temple, after securing a receipt for the safe transfer of their ward, who was declared to be in good health. A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the Bourbon Restoration, making ascertaining of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room that was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal. The story recounts that food was passed through the bars to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.

Maximilien Robespierre visited Marie-Thérèse on 11 May, but no one, according to the legend, entered the boy&#x27;s room for six months until Paul Barras visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794). Barras&#x27;s account of the visit describes the child as suffering from extreme neglect, but conveys no idea of the alleged walling-in. The boy made no complaint to Barras of any ill treatment. He was then cleaned and re-clothed. His room was cleaned, and during the day he was visited by his new attendant, (1770–1807), a creole from Martinique. From 8 November onward, Laurent had assistance from a man named Gomin.
Louis-Charles was then taken out for fresh air and walks on the roof of the Tower. From about the time of Gomin&#x27;s arrival, he was inspected, not by delegates of the Commune, but by representatives of the civil committee of the 48 sections of Paris. From the end of October onward, the child maintained silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On 19 December 1794, he was visited by three commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety — , Jean-Baptiste Charles Matthieu and  — but they failed to get the boy to say anything at all.

====1795: Death====

On 31 March 1795, was appointed to be the child&#x27;s guardian in place of Laurent. In May that year the boy was seriously ill, and a doctor, P. J. Desault, who had visited him seven months earlier, was summoned. However, on 1 June, Desault himself died suddenly, not without suspicion of poison, and it was some days before doctors Philippe-Jean Pelletan and Jean-Baptiste Dumangin were called.

Louis-Charles died on 8 June 1795. The next day an autopsy was conducted by Pelletan. In the report it was stated that a child apparently about 10 years of age, &quot;which the commissioners told us was the late Louis Capet&#x27;s son&quot;, had died of a scrofulous infection of long standing. &quot;Scrofula&quot; as it was previously known, is nowadays called &quot;tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis&quot; referring to a lymphadenitis (chronic lymph node swelling or infection) of the neck (cervical lymph nodes) associated with tuberculosis. During the autopsy, the physician Dr. Pelletan was shocked to see the countless scars which covered the boy&#x27;s body, evidently the result of the physical mistreatment which the child had suffered while imprisoned in the Temple.

Louis-Charles was buried on 10 June in the Sainte Marguerite cemetery, but no stone was erected to mark the spot. A skull was found there in 1846 and identified as his, though later re-examination in 1893 showed it to be from a teenager and therefore unlikely to be his.

==== Heart of Louis-Charles ====

Following a tradition of preserving royal hearts, Louis-Charles&#x27;s heart was removed and smuggled out during the autopsy by the overseeing physician, Philippe-Jean Pelletan. Thus, Louis-Charles&#x27; heart was not interred with the rest of the body. Dr. Pelletan stored the smuggled heart in distilled wine in order to preserve it. However, after 8 to 10 years the distilled wine had evaporated, and the heart was from that time kept dry.

After the Restoration in 1815, Dr. Pelletan attempted to give the heart to Louis-Charles&#x27;s uncle, Louis XVIII; the latter refused because he could not bring himself to believe that it was the heart of his nephew. Dr. Pelletan then donated the heart to the Archbishop of Paris, Hyacinthe-Louis de Quélen. Following the Revolution of 1830, and the plundering of the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace of Paris, Pelletan&#x27;s son Philippe-Gabriel found the relic among the ruins and placed it in the crystal urn in which it is still kept today. After the younger Pelletan&#x27;s death in 1879, it passed to Édouard Dumont.

It was later offered to Carlos, Duke of Madrid in 1895, a pretender to the throne of France and Spain, nephew (both biological and in-law) of the Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este. The offer was accepted and the relic was held near Vienna at Schloss Frohsdorf. In 1909, Carlos&#x27;s son, Jaime, Duke of Madrid, inherited the heart, and gave it to his sister, Beatriz de Borbón (1874–1961), wife of Prince Fabrizio Massimo (1868–1944), and in 1938, to their daughter Maria della Neve, wife of Charles Piercy.

Finally Maria della Neve offered the heart to Jacques de Bauffremont, president of the Memorial of the Basilica of St Denis in Paris. He in turn put the heart and its crystal urn in the basilica&#x27;s necropolis of the Kings of France, the burial place of Louis-Charles&#x27;s parents and other members of the French royal family.
There it rested undisturbed until December 1999, when public notaries witnessed the removal of a section of the muscle of the heart&#x27;s aorta and its transfer into a sealed envelope, and subsequently the opening of the same sealed envelope in the laboratory for it to be tested.

It was in 2000 that the historian Philippe Delorme arranged for DNA testing of the heart as well as bone samples from one of the many historical claimants to Louis-Charles&#x27;s identity, namely Karl Wilhelm Naundorff, a German clockmaker. Ernst Brinkmann of Münster University and Belgian genetics professor Jean-Jacques Cassiman of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, conducted mitochondrial DNA tests using a strand of the hair of the boy&#x27;s mother, Marie Antoinette, and other samples from her sisters Maria Johanna Gabriela and Maria Josepha, their mother, Empress Maria Theresa, and two living direct descendants in the strict maternal line of Maria Theresa, namely Queen Anne of Romania and her brother, Prince André of Bourbon-Parma, maternal relatives of Louis XVII. The tests proved both that Naundorff was not the dauphin, and the heart was that of Louis-Charles.

Of these results, historian Jean Tulard wrote: &quot;This [mummified] heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII. We can never be 100 per cent sure but this is about as sure as it gets&quot;.

In the light of this conclusion, French Legitimists organized the heart&#x27;s solemn burial in the Basilica of St Denis on 8 June 2004. The burial took place in connection with a mass and during the ceremony 12-year-old Prince Amaury of Bourbon-Parma carried the heart and placed it in a niche beside the tombs of Louis-Charles&#x27; parents, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.
It was the first time in over a century that a royal ceremony had taken place in France, complete with the fleur-de-lis standard and a royal crown.

==Lost Dauphin claimants==

As rumors quickly spread that the body buried was not that of Louis-Charles and that he had been spirited away alive by sympathizers, the legend of the &quot;Lost Dauphin&quot; was born. When the Bourbon monarchy was restored in 1814, some one hundred claimants came forward. Would-be royal heirs continued to appear across Europe for decades afterward.

===Naundorff===
Karl Wilhelm Naundorff was a German clockmaker whose story rested on a series of complicated intrigues. According to him, Paul Barras determined to save the Dauphin in order to please Joséphine de Beauharnais, the future empress, having conceived the idea of using the Dauphin&#x27;s existence as a means of dominating the comte de Provence in the event of a restoration. The Dauphin was concealed in the fourth storey of the Tower, a wooden figure being substituted for him. Laurent, to protect himself from the consequences of the substitution, replaced the wooden figure with a deaf mute, who was presently exchanged for the scrofulous child of the death certificate. The deaf mute was also concealed in the Temple. It was not the dead child, but the Dauphin who left the prison in the coffin, to be retrieved by friends before it reached the cemetery.

Naundorff arrived in Berlin in 1810, with papers giving the name Karl Wilhelm Naundorff. He said he was escaping persecution and settled at Spandau in 1812 as a clockmaker, marrying Johanna Einert in 1818. In 1822 he removed to Brandenburg an der Havel, and in 1828 to Crossen, near Frankfurt (Oder). He was imprisoned from 1825 to 1828 for coining, though apparently on insufficient evidence, and in 1833 came to push his claims in Paris, where he was recognized as the Dauphin by many persons formerly connected with the court of Louis XVI. Expelled from France in 1836, the day after bringing a suit against Marie Thérèse, Duchess of Angoulême for the restitution of the Dauphin&#x27;s private property, he lived in exile until his death at Delft on 10 August 1845, and his tomb was inscribed &quot;Louis XVII., roi de France et de Navarre (Charles Louis, duc de Normandie)&quot;. The Dutch authorities who had inscribed on his death certificate the name of Charles Louis de Bourbon, duc de Normandie (Louis XVII) permitted his son to bear the name de Bourbon, and when the family appealed in 1850–51, and again in 1874, for the restitution of their civil rights as heirs of Louis XVI, no less an advocate than Jules Favre pled their cause.

However, DNA testing conducted in 1993 proved that Naundorff was not the Dauphin.

===Richemont===
Baron de Richemont&#x27;s tale that Jeanne Simon, who was genuinely attached to him, smuggled him out in a basket, is simple and more credible, and does not necessarily invalidate the story of the subsequent operations with the deaf mute and the scrofulous patient, Laurent in that case being deceived from the beginning, but it renders them extremely unlikely. Richemont, alias &quot;Henri Éthelbert-Louis-Hector Hébert&quot;, began to put forward his claims in Paris in 1828. He died in 1853.

===Williams===
Reverend Eleazer Williams was a Protestant missionary from Wisconsin of Mohawk Native American descent. While at the house Francis Vinton, William began shaking and trembling upon seeing a portrait of Antoine Simon, a member of the sans-culottes, saying of the portrait that it had &quot;haunted me, day, and night, as long as I can remember.&quot; Simon was rumored to have physically abused the Dauphin while he was imprisoned at the Temple. Francis Vinton was convinced by Eleazar William&#x27;s reaction that Williams was Louis-Charles. Williams claimed he had no recollection of how he escaped his imprisonment at the Temple, or of his early years in France.

Williams was a missionary to Native Americans when, according to him, the prince de Joinville, son of Louis-Philippe, met him, and after some conversation asked him to sign a document abdicating his rights in favor of Louis-Philippe, in return for which he, the Dauphin (alias Eleazar Williams), was to receive the private inheritance which was his. This Eleazar Williams refused. Williams&#x27;s story is generally regarded as false. However, other elements published in 1897 provide some grounds for doubt.
