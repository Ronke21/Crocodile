<text>Stagecoach is a 1939 American Western film directed by John Ford and starring Claire Trevor and John Wayne. The screenplay by Dudley Nichols is an adaptation of &quot;The Stage to Lordsburg&quot;, a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox. The film follows an eclectic group of travellers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory.

The film has long been recognized as an important work that transcends the Western genre. In 1995, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry. Still, &quot;Stagecoach&quot; has not avoided controversy. Like most Westerns of the era, its depiction of Native Americans as simplistic savages has been criticized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aleiss 2005 https://archive.org/details/makingwhitemansi00alei/page/60 60&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Stagecoach&quot; was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot in Monument Valley, on the Arizona–Utah border in the American Southwest. Some scenes blended shots of Monument Valley with those filmed on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, RKO Encino Ranch, and elsewhere, and as a result geographic incongruities appear.

==Plot==

In June 1880, stage driver Buck prepares a stagecoach from Tonto, Arizona Territory, to Lordsburg, New Mexico. Among the passengers are Dallas, a prostitute driven out of town by the &quot;Law and Order League&quot;; the alcoholic doctor Josiah Boone; snobbish belle Lucy Mallory, who is travelling to join her cavalry officer husband; and diminutive whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock.

Meanwhile, Henry the &quot;Ringo Kid&quot; has broken out of prison to avenge the murder of his father and brother by Luke Plummer, a dangerous gunslinger who is in Lordsburg with his two brothers. The Plummers also accused Ringo of killing their foreman, which led to Ringo&#x27;s conviction. Marshal Curley Wilcox decides to ride shotgun on the stage and find Ringo. U.S. Cavalry Lieutenant Blanchard announces that Geronimo and his Apache warriors are on the warpath, therefore Blanchard&#x27;s troop will provide a temporary escort to Dry Fork station. Hatfield, a chivalrous gambler and former Confederate Army officer, offers Mallory his protection and climbs aboard. Ellsworth H. Gatewood, an arrogant banker, also boards.

En route, the stage encounters Ringo, stranded after his horse went lame. Though Curley and Ringo are friends, Curley takes Ringo into custody. When they reach Dry Fork, they learn the expected cavalry detachment has gone on to Apache Wells station. Most of the party votes to proceed. The group is taken aback when Ringo, unaware of her profession, bonds with Dallas as the journey progresses.

At Apache Wells, Mallory learns that her husband was wounded in battle with the Apaches and rushed to Lordsburg. She faints, and stunning the group, goes into labor. Doc Boone sobers up and delivers the baby with Dallas assisting. Later that night, Ringo asks Dallas to marry him and live on a ranch he owns across the border in Mexico. Afraid to reveal her past, she is evasive. The next morning, she accepts with Boone&#x27;s encouragement, but is unwilling to leave Mallory and the newborn; instead, she encourages Ringo to escape, promising to meet him in Mexico later. Before Ringo can leave, he sees smoke signals heralding nearby Apache and returns to custody.

The stage reaches a ferry crossing, which the Apaches have murderously sacked. Curley uncuffs Ringo to help lash logs to the stagecoach and float it across the river. The Apache eventually attack and a long chase ensues, during which Buck and Peacock are wounded. Down to his last bullet, Hatfield prepares to humanely dispatch Mallory when he is mortally wounded. The stage is then rescued by the 6th Cavalry.

At Lordsburg, Gatewood is arrested for attempting to abscond with his bank&#x27;s funds. Mallory learns that her wounded husband will fully recover; she thanks Dallas, who gives Mallory her shawl. Peacock invites Dallas to visit his home in Kansas City, Kansas. Ringo escorts Dallas to her destination in a seedy part of town and finally learns who she is, but he reiterates his desire to marry her. 

Luke Plummer, who is playing poker in one of the saloons, hears of Ringo&#x27;s arrival and summons his brothers to join him in the showdown. Ringo guns down the Plummers in a shootout, then surrenders to Curley, expecting to go back to prison. As Ringo takes his seat on a buckboard, Curley invites Dallas to ride with them to the edge of town. But when she gets aboard, Curley and Boone stampede the horses, happily letting the couple speed off together towards Ringo&#x27;s ranch.

===Development===
The screenplay is an adaptation by Dudley Nichols of &quot;The Stage to Lordsburg,&quot; a short story by Ernest Haycox. The film rights to the work were bought by John Ford soon after it was published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine on April 10, 1937. According to Thomas Schatz, Ford claimed that his inspiration in expanding &quot;Stagecoach&quot; beyond the bare-bones plot created by Haycox was his familiarity with another short story, &quot;Boule de Suif&quot; by Guy de Maupassant, although Schatz believes &quot;this scarcely holds up to scrutiny&quot;. Ford&#x27;s statement also seems to be the basis for the claim that Haycox himself relied upon Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s story. However, according to a Haycox biographer, there is no direct evidence of Haycox being familiar with Maupassant’s tale, especially as he was documented as going out of his way to avoid reading the work of others that might unconsciously influence his writing, and he focused his personal reading in the area of history.
John Ford admitted that he took inspiration from a 1907 painting by Frederic Remington named &quot;Downing the Nigh Leader&quot; for the chase scene.

Before production, Ford shopped the project around to several Hollywood studios, all of which turned him down because big budget Westerns had been out of vogue since the silents, and because Ford insisted on using then-B-movie actor John Wayne in the key role in the film. Independent producer David O. Selznick finally agreed to produce it, but was frustrated by Ford&#x27;s indecision about when shooting would begin, and had his own doubts over the casting. Ford withdrew the film from Selznick&#x27;s company and approached independent producer Walter Wanger about the project. Wanger had the same reservations about producing an &quot;A&quot; Western and even more about one starring John Wayne. Ford had not directed a Western since the silent days. Wanger said he would not risk his money unless Ford replaced John Wayne with Gary Cooper and brought in Marlene Dietrich to play Dallas.

Ford refused to budge; it would be Wayne or no one. Eventually the pair compromised, with Wanger putting up $250,000, a little more than half of what Ford had been seeking, and Ford would give top billing to Claire Trevor, better known than John Wayne at the time.

===Filming===

The members of the production crew were billeted in Kayenta, in Northeastern Arizona, in an old CCC camp. Conditions were spartan, production hours long, and weather conditions at the elevation were extreme, with constant strong winds and low temperatures. Nonetheless, director John Ford was satisfied with the crew&#x27;s location work, which took place near Goulding&#x27;s Trading Post on the Utah border, about 25 miles from Kayenta. Additional scenes were filmed in Monument Valley locations, as well as the Iverson Movie Ranch and the RKO Encino Ranch. &quot;Stagecoach&quot; was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot using Monument Valley as a location, many of which also starred John Wayne. Anatopic incongruencies of landscape and vegetation are thus evident throughout the film, up to the closing scene of Ringo and Dallas departing Lordsburg, in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwestern New Mexico, by way of the unmistakable topography of Monument Valley&#x27;s Colorado Plateau location.

==Reception==
The film was released on March 2, 1939, and met with immediate critical and trade paper praise. The picture cemented John Wayne&#x27;s standing as an A-list leading man, and made a profit of $297,690. Cast member Louise Platt, in a letter recounting the experience of the film&#x27;s production, quoted Ford on saying of Wayne&#x27;s future in film: &quot;He&#x27;ll be the biggest star ever because he is the perfect &#x27;everyman&#x27;&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 9.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Typifying the best that the Western genre has to offer, Stagecoach is a rip-roaring adventure given dramatic heft by John Ford&#x27;s dynamic direction and John Wayne&#x27;s mesmerizing star turn.&quot;

&quot;Stagecoach&quot; has been lauded as one of the most influential films ever made. Orson Welles argued that it was a perfect textbook of filmmaking and claimed to have watched it more than 40 times in preparation for the making of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. In 1995, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry; it was also included in the Vatican&#x27;s list of films that year under the category of &quot;Art&quot;.

The film has been recognized as transcending the Western genre. Robert B. Pippin has observed that both the collection of characters and their journey &quot;are archetypal rather than merely individual&quot; and that the film is a &quot;mythic representation of the American aspiration toward a form of politically meaningful equality.&quot; Nevertheless, its depiction of Native Americans is not above criticism. Writing in 2011, Roger Ebert noted, &quot;The film&#x27;s attitudes toward Native Americans are unenlightened. The Apaches are seen simply as murderous savages; there is no suggestion the white men have invaded their land.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
===American Film Institute===
* In June 1998, the American Film Institute published its &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies&quot;—the 100 best American films, in the judgment of over 1,500 movie industry artists and leaders, who selected from a list of 400 nominated films. They ranked &quot;Stagecoach&quot; as #63 of the 100 best.
* In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American Western film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Stagecoach&quot; was acknowledged as the ninth best film in the Western genre.

==Re-releases and restoration==
The film was originally released through United Artists, but under the terms of its seven-year-rights rule, the company surrendered distribution rights to producer Walter Wanger in 1946. Numerous companies have held the rights to the picture in the years since. The film&#x27;s copyright (originally by Walter Wanger Productions) was renewed by 20th Century Fox, which produced a later 1966 remake of &quot;Stagecoach&quot;. The rights to the original 1939 film were subsequently acquired by Time-Life Films during the 1970s. The copyright has since been reassigned to Wanger Productions through the late producer&#x27;s family under the Caidin Trust/Caidin Film Company, the ancillary rights holder. However, distribution rights are now held by Shout! Factory, which in 2014 acquired Jumer Productions/Westchester Films (which in turn had bought the Caidin Film holdings after the folding of former distributor Castle Hill Productions). Warner Bros. Pictures handles sales and additional distribution.

The original negative of &quot;Stagecoach&quot; was either lost or destroyed. Wayne had one unscreened positive print that director Peter Bogdanovich noticed in Wayne&#x27;s garage while visiting. In 1970, Wayne allowed it to be used to produce a new negative, often seen at film festivals. UCLA fully restored the film in 1996 from surviving elements and premiered it on cable&#x27;s American Movie Classics network. The previous DVD releases by Warner Home Video did not contain the restored print but rather a video print held in the Castle Hill/Caidin Trust library. A digitally restored Blu-ray/DVD version was released in May 2010 via The Criterion Collection.

== Lone Ranger radio play ==
The theme of the movie has been reproduced as a Lone Ranger radio episode &quot;The Last Coach West&quot;, which played August 22, 1945. Most main characters in the movie had a counter-part in the radio play.

The plot of the radio play closely paralleled that of the movie in spite of the character changes, with exception of the Lone Ranger and Tonto heroically saving the stagecoach occupants from Geronimo&#x27;s warriors.
The radio play run time was only about 22 minutes, less than one quarter of the movie&#x27;s 96. Consequently, character and plot development had to be accelerated, which resulted in weakening the character&#x27;s motivation for certain actions (such as the Lone Ranger somehow managing to single out a solitary stagecoach amid a wide Indian uprising).

==Remakes==
===Radio===
* The May 4, 1946, radio episode of Academy Award Theater had Claire Trevor reprise her role alongside Randolph Scott.
* The December 7, 1946, radio episode of &quot;Hollywood Star Time&quot; presented &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, adapted by Milton Geiger.
* The January 9, 1949, radio episode of Screen Directors Playhouse had John Wayne and Claire Trevor both reprise their parts.

===Film===
* The 1966 remake of &quot;Stagecoach&quot; stars (in alphabetical order) Ann-Margret as Dallas, Red Buttons as the whiskey drummer, Mike Connors as the gambler, Alex Cord as the Ringo Kid, Bing Crosby as Doc Boone, Robert Cummings as the embezzler, Van Heflin as the Marshal, Slim Pickens as Buck, Stefanie Powers as Lucy, and Keenan Wynn as Luke Plummer.

===Television===
* A 1986 television version features Willie Nelson as Doc Holliday, Kris Kristofferson as the Ringo Kid, Johnny Cash as the Marshal, Waylon Jennings as Hatfield, Tony Franciosa as the embezzler, John Schneider as Buck, Anthony Newley as the whiskey drummer, Elizabeth Ashley as Dallas, Mary Crosby as Lucy, June Carter Cash as Mrs. Pickett, and Jessi Colter as Martha.

<text>Raymond William Stacy Burr (May 21, 1917September 12, 1993) was a Canadian actor who had a lengthy Hollywood film career and portrayed the title roles in the television dramas &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;Ironside&quot;.

Burr&#x27;s early acting career included roles on Broadway, radio, television, and film, usually as the villain. He portrayed the suspected murderer in the Alfred Hitchcock thriller &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), and he also had a role in the 1956 film &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot;, which he reprised in the 1985 film &quot;Godzilla 1985&quot;. He won Emmy Awards for acting in 1959 and 1961 for the role of Perry Mason, which he played for nine seasons (1957–1966) and reprised in a series of 26 &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV movies (1985–1993). His second TV series, &quot;Ironside,&quot; earned him six Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations.

Burr died due to liver cancer in 1993, and his personal life came into question, as many details of his biography appeared to be unverifiable. He was ranked number 44 of the 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time by &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine in 1996.

==Early life==
Raymond William Stacy Burr was born May 21, 1917, in New Westminster, British Columbia. His father William Johnston Burr (1889–1985) was a hardware salesman; his mother Minerva Annette (née Smith, 1892–1974) was a pianist and music teacher.

When Burr was six, his parents divorced. He moved to Vallejo, California, with his mother and younger siblings Geraldine and James, while his father remained in New Westminster. Burr briefly attended San Rafael Military Academy in San Rafael, California, and graduated from Berkeley High School.

In 1986, he told journalist Jane Ardmore that, when he was 12 years old, his mother sent him to New Mexico for a year to work as a ranch hand. (As with many of Burr&#x27;s self-reported autobiographical details about his early life, this is unverified and open to question). According to Burr&#x27;s story, he was already his full adult height and rather large and &quot;had fallen in with a group of college-aged kids who didn&#x27;t realize how young Raymond was, and they let him tag along with them in activities and situations far too sophisticated for him to handle.&quot; In the same article, Burr also stated he developed a passion for growing things and joined the Civilian Conservation Corps for a year in his teens. He did some acting in his teen years, making his stage debut at age 12 in a Vancouver stock company. The experiences Burr described when he was the age of 12 (working in radio in San Francisco, spending a year in New Mexico, appearing in Vancouver theatre, working for the Civilian Conservation Corps) are sometimes mutually contradictory; this would be a pattern that would recur in Burr&#x27;s autobiographical reminiscences about his pre-Perry Mason personal life. 

==Acting career==
===Theatre===
Burr grew up during the Great Depression and hoped to study acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, but he was unable to afford the tuition. By his own account, in 1934 he joined a repertory theatre company in Toronto that toured throughout Canada, then joined another company that toured India, Australia, and England. He briefly attended Long Beach Junior College and taught for a semester at San Jose Junior College, working nights as a radio actor and singer. Burr began his association with the Pasadena Playhouse in 1937.

Burr moved to New York in 1940 and made his first Broadway appearance in &quot;Crazy With the Heat&quot;, a two-act musical revue produced by Kurt Kasznar. Despite the veteran cast of stars Willie Howard, Luella Gear, and Gracie Barrie, the show folded after three months. Burr&#x27;s first starring role on the stage came in November 1942 when he was an emergency replacement in a Pasadena Playhouse production of &quot;Quiet Wedding&quot;. He became a member of the Pasadena Playhouse drama faculty for 18 months, and he performed in some 30 plays over the years. He returned to Broadway for Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;The Duke in Darkness&quot; (1944), a psychological drama set during the French Wars of Religion. His performance as the loyal friend of the imprisoned protagonist led to a contract with RKO Radio Pictures. In 1944, he performed in multiple plays during his summer residency at Elitch Gardens Theater in Denver Colorado.

===Film===

Burr appeared in more than 50 feature films between 1946 and 1957, creating an array of villains that established him as an icon of film noir. Film historian Alain Silver concluded that Burr&#x27;s most significant work in the genre is in ten films: &quot;Desperate&quot; (1947), &quot;Sleep, My Love&quot; (1948), &quot;Raw Deal&quot; (1948), &quot;Pitfall&quot; (1948), &quot;Abandoned&quot; (1949), &quot;Red Light&quot; (1949), &quot;M&quot; (1951), &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; (1951), &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot; (1953), and &quot;Crime of Passion&quot; (1957). Silver described Burr&#x27;s private detective in &quot;Pitfall&quot; as &quot;both reprehensible and pathetic,&quot; a characterization also cited by film historian Richard Schickel as a prototype of film noir, in contrast with the appealing television characters for which Burr later became famous. &quot;He tried to make you see the psychosis below the surface, even when the parts weren&#x27;t huge,&quot; said film historian James Ursini. &quot;He was able to bring such complexity and different levels to those characters, and create sympathy for his characters even though they were doing reprehensible things.&quot;

Other titles in Burr&#x27;s film noir legacy include &quot;Walk a Crooked Mile&quot; (1948), &quot;Borderline&quot; (1950), &quot;Unmasked&quot; (1950), &quot;The Whip Hand&quot; (1951), &quot;FBI Girl&quot; (1951), &quot;Meet Danny Wilson&quot; (1952), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), &quot;They Were So Young&quot; (1954), &quot;A Cry in the Night&quot; (1956), and &quot;Affair in Havana&quot; (1957). His villains were also seen in Westerns, period dramas, horror films, and adventure films.

&quot;I was just a fat heavy,&quot; Burr told journalist James Bawden. &quot;I split the heavy parts with Bill Conrad. We were both in our twenties playing much older men. I never got the girl but I once got the gorilla in a 3-D picture called &quot;Gorilla at Large&quot;. I menaced Claudette Colbert, Lizabeth Scott, Paulette Goddard, Anne Baxter, Barbara Stanwyck. Those girls would take one look at me and scream and can you blame them? I was drowned, beaten, stabbed and all for my art. But I knew I was horribly overweight. I lacked any kind of self esteem. At 25 I was playing the fathers of people older than me.&quot;

Burr&#x27;s occasional roles on the right side of the law include the aggressive prosecutor in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951). His courtroom performance in that film made an impression on Gail Patrick and her husband Cornwell Jackson, who had Burr in mind when they began casting the role of Los Angeles district attorney Hamilton Burger in the CBS-TV series &quot;Perry Mason&quot;.

===Radio===
By the age of 12, Burr was appearing in national radio dramas broadcasting in nearby San Francisco.

As a young man Burr weighed more than , which limited his on-screen roles. &quot;But in radio this presented no problems, given the magnificent quality of his voice&quot;, reported &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. &quot;He played romantic leads and menacing villains with equal authority, and he earned a steady and comfortable income.&quot;

Working steadily in radio since the 1940s, often uncredited, Burr was a leading player on the West Coast. He had a regular role in Jack Webb&#x27;s first radio show, &quot;Pat Novak for Hire&quot; (1949), and in &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1949–50) he played Joe Friday&#x27;s boss, Ed Backstrand, chief of detectives. Burr worked on other Los Angeles-based series including &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;, &quot;Family Theater&quot;, &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. He performed in five episodes of the experimental dramatic radio anthology series &quot;CBS Radio Workshop&quot;, and had what is arguably his best radio role in &quot;The Silent Witness&quot; (1957), in which his is the only voice.

From March 1951 through June 1952 Burr used the name of Ray Hartman approximately 30 times when appearing on radio, mostly on &quot;Dangerous Assignment&quot;, &quot;The Lineup&quot; and &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;. This was verified by perusing the scripts for both series.

In 1956, Burr was the star of CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Fort Laramie&quot;, an adult Western drama produced, written and directed by the creators of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He played the role of Lee Quince, captain of the cavalry, in the series set at a post-Civil War military post where disease, boredom, the elements and the uncharted terrain were the greatest enemies of &quot;ordinary men who lived in extraordinary times&quot;. The half-hour transcribed program aired Sundays at 5:30 pm. ET January 22 – October 28, 1956. Burr told columnist Sheilah Graham that he had received 1,500 fan letters after the first broadcasts, and he continued to receive letters praising the show&#x27;s authenticity and presentation of human dignity.

In August 1956, CBS announced that Burr would star in the television series &quot;Perry Mason&quot;. Although the network wanted Burr to continue work on &quot;Fort Laramie&quot; as well, the TV series required an extraordinary commitment and the radio show ended.

Known for his loyalty and consciousness of history, Burr went out of his way to employ his radio colleagues in his television programs. Some 180 radio celebrities appeared on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; during the first season alone.

===Television===
Burr emerged as a prolific television character actor in the 1950s. He made his television debut in 1951, appearing in episodes of &quot;Stars Over Hollywood&quot;, &quot;The Bigelow Theatre&quot;, &quot;Family Theater&quot; and the debut episode of &quot;Dragnet&quot;. He went on to appear in such programs as &quot;Gruen Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. North&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

===&quot;Perry Mason&quot;===
In 1956, Burr auditioned for &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, a new CBS-TV courtroom drama based on the highly successful novels by Erle Stanley Gardner. Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. had already been tentatively cast as Perry Mason. Burr told associate producer Sam White, &quot;If you don&#x27;t like me as Perry Mason, then I&#x27;ll go along and play the part of the district attorney, Hamilton Burger.&quot; Executive producer Gail Patrick Jackson had been impressed with Burr&#x27;s courtroom performance in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951), and she told Burr that he was perfect for Perry Mason but at least overweight. He went on a crash diet over the following month; he then tested as Perry Mason and was cast in the role. While Burr&#x27;s test was running, Gardner reportedly stood up, pointed at the screen, and said, &quot;That&#x27;s Perry Mason.&quot; William Hopper also auditioned as Mason, but he was cast instead as private detective Paul Drake. The series also starred Barbara Hale as Della Street, Mason&#x27;s secretary, William Talman as Hamilton Burger, the district attorney who loses nearly every case to Mason, and Ray Collins as homicide detective Lieutenant Arthur Tragg.

The series ran from 1957 to 1966 and made Burr a star. In the early 1960s, the show had 30 million viewers every Saturday night and Burr received 3,000 fan letters a week. Burr received three consecutive Emmy Award nominations and won the award in 1959 and 1961 for his performance as Perry Mason. The series has been rerun in syndication ever since, and was released on DVD between 2006 and 2013. Burr&#x27;s character is often said never to have lost a case, although he did lose two murder cases off-screen in early episodes of the series.
===&quot;Ironside&quot;===

Burr moved from CBS to Universal Studios, where he played the title role in the television drama &quot;Ironside&quot;, which ran on NBC from 1967 to 1975. In the pilot episode, San Francisco Chief of Detectives Robert T. Ironside is paralyzed by a sniper during an attempt on his life and, after his recovery, uses a wheelchair for mobility, in the first crime drama show to star a policeman with a disability. The show earned Burr six Emmy nominations—one for the pilot and five for his work in the series—and two Golden Globe nominations.

===Other series===

After &quot;Ironside&quot; went off the air, NBC failed in two attempts to launch Burr as the star of a new series. In a two-hour television movie format, &quot;Mallory: Circumstantial Evidence&quot; aired in February 1976 with Burr again in the role of the lawyer who outwits the district attorney. Despite good reviews for Burr, the critical reception was poor, and NBC decided against developing it into a series.

In 1977, Burr starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;&quot; as R.B. Kingston, a publishing magnate similar to William Randolph Hearst, owner of numerous newspapers and TV stations, who, in his spare time, solved crimes along with a group of employees. It was a critical failure that was scheduled opposite the extraordinarily popular &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. It was cancelled after 13 weeks.

Burr took on a shorter project next, playing an underworld boss in a six-hour miniseries, &quot;79 Park Avenue&quot;.

One last attempt to launch a series followed on CBS. The two-hour premiere of &quot;The Jordan Chance&quot; aroused little interest.

On January 20, 1987, Burr hosted the television special that later served as the pilot for the long-running series &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;.

===Television films===

In 1985, Burr was approached by producers Dean Hargrove and Fred Silverman to star in a made-for-TV movie, &quot;Perry Mason Returns&quot;. The same week, Burr recalled, he was asked to reprise the role he played in &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot; (1956), in a low-budget film that would be titled &quot;Godzilla 1985&quot;.

&quot;When they asked me to do it a second time, I said, &#x27;Certainly,&#x27; and everybody thought I was out of my mind,&quot; Burr told Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. &quot;But it wasn&#x27;t the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked &#x27;Godzilla,&#x27; and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them.&quot; Although Burr is best remembered for his role as Perry Mason, a devoted following continues to appreciate him as the actor that brought the Godzilla series to America.

He agreed to do the Mason movie if Barbara Hale returned to reprise her role as Della Street. Hale agreed, and when &quot;Perry Mason Returns&quot; aired in December 1985, her character became the defendant. The rest of the principal cast had died, but Hale&#x27;s real-life son William Katt played the role of Paul Drake Jr. The movie was so successful that Burr made a total of 26 Perry Mason television movies before his death. Many were filmed in and around Denver, Colorado.

After several of the TV movies, Burr&#x27;s age and health issues forced him to use a cane onscreen, which was jokingly explained as a &quot;skiing accident.&quot; By 1993, when Burr signed with NBC for another season of Mason films, he was using a wheelchair full-time because of his failing health. In his final Perry Mason movie, &quot;The Case of the Killer Kiss&quot;, he was shown either sitting or standing while leaning on a table, but only once standing unsupported for a few seconds. Twelve more Mason movies were scheduled before Burr&#x27;s death, including one scheduled to film the month he died.

As he had with the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV movies, Burr decided to do an &quot;Ironside&quot; reunion movie. &quot;The Return of Ironside&quot; aired in May 1993, reuniting the entire original cast of the 1967–75 series. Like many of the Mason movies, it was set and filmed in Denver.

==Personal life==
===Physical characteristics===
Burr said that he weighed 12.75 pounds (5.8 kg) at birth, and was chubby throughout his childhood. &quot;When you&#x27;re a little fat boy in public school, or any kind of school, you&#x27;re just persecuted something awful,&quot; he said. His weight was always an issue for him in getting roles, and it became a public relations problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson&#x27;s guest from then on, and told &quot;Us Weekly&quot; years later: &quot;I have been asked a number of times to do his show and I won&#x27;t do it. Because I like NBC. He&#x27;s doing an NBC show. If I went on I&#x27;d have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he&#x27;s done about me, but bad jokes he does about everybody who can&#x27;t fight back because they aren&#x27;t there. And that wouldn&#x27;t be good for NBC.&quot;

===Family life===
Burr married actress Isabella Ward (1919–2004) on January 10, 1948. They met in 1943 while she was a student at the Pasadena Playhouse where Burr was teaching. They met again in 1947 when she was in California with a theater company. They were married shortly before Burr began work on the 1948 film noir &quot;Pitfall&quot;. In May 1948, they appeared on stage together in a Pasadena Playhouse production based on the life of Paul Gauguin. They lived in the basement apartment of a large house in Hollywood that Burr shared with his mother and grandparents. The marriage ended within months, and Ward returned to her native Delaware. They divorced in 1952, and neither remarried.

In 1960, Burr met Robert Benevides, an actor and Korean War veteran, on the set of &quot;Perry Mason&quot;. Benevides gave up acting in 1963, and he became a production consultant for 21 of the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV movies. They owned and operated an orchid business and then a vineyard in California&#x27;s Dry Creek Valley. They were domestic partners until Burr&#x27;s death in 1993. Burr bequeathed his entire estate to Benevides, and Benevides renamed the Dry Creek property Raymond Burr Vineyards (reportedly against Burr&#x27;s wishes) and managed it as a commercial enterprise. In 2017, the property was sold.

Although Burr had not revealed that he was homosexual during his lifetime, it was reported in the press upon his death.

===Biographical contradictions===
At various times in his career, Burr and his managers and publicists offered spurious or unverifiable biographical details to the press and public. Burr&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that he entered the U.S. Navy in 1944, after &quot;The Duke in Darkness&quot;, and left in 1946, weighing almost . Although Burr may have served in the Coast Guard, reports of his service in the U.S. Navy are false, as apparently are his statements that he sustained battle injuries at Okinawa.

Other false biographical details include years of college education at a variety of institutions, being widowed twice, a son who died young, world travel, and success in high school athletics. Most of these claims were apparently accepted as fact by the press during Burr&#x27;s lifetime, up until his death and by his first biographer, Ona Hill.

Burr reportedly was married at the beginning of World War II to an actress named Annette Sutherland—killed, Burr said, in the same 1943 plane crash that claimed the life of actor Leslie Howard. However, multiple sources have reported that no one by that name appears on any of the published passenger manifests from the flight. A son supposedly born during this marriage, Michael Evan, was said to have died of leukemia in 1953 at the age of ten. Another marriage purportedly took place in the early 1950s to a Laura Andrina Morgan—who died of cancer, Burr said, in 1955. Yet no evidence exists of either marriage, nor of a son&#x27;s birth, other than Burr&#x27;s own claims. As late as 1991, Burr stood by the account of this son&#x27;s life and death. He told &quot;Parade&quot; that when he realized Michael was dying, he took him on a one-year tour of the United States. &quot;Before my boy left, before his time was gone,&quot; he said, &quot;I wanted him to see the beauty of his country and its people.&quot; After Burr&#x27;s death, his publicist confirmed that Burr worked steadily in Hollywood throughout 1952, the year that he was supposedly touring the country with his son.

In the late 1950s, Burr was rumored to be romantically involved with Natalie Wood. Wood&#x27;s agent sent her on public dates so she could be noticed by directors and producers, and so the men she dated could present themselves in public as heterosexuals. The dates helped to disguise Wood&#x27;s relationship with Robert Wagner, whom she later married. Burr reportedly resented Warner Bros.&#x27; decision to promote her attachment to another gay actor, Tab Hunter, rather than him. Robert Benevides later said, &quot;He was a little bitter about it. He was really in love with her, I guess.&quot;

Later accounts of Burr&#x27;s life say that he hid his homosexuality to protect his career. &quot;That was a time in Hollywood history when homosexuality was not countenanced&quot;, Associated Press reporter Bob Thomas recalled in a 2000 episode of &quot;Biography&quot;. &quot;Ray was not a romantic star by any means, but he was a very popular figure ... If it was revealed at that time in Hollywood history it would have been very difficult for him to continue.&quot;

Arthur Marks, a producer of &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, recalled Burr&#x27;s talk of wives and children: &quot;I know he was just putting on a show. ... That was my gut feeling. I think the wives and the loving women, the Natalie Wood thing, were a bit of a cover.&quot; Dean Hargrove, executive producer of the Perry Mason TV films, said in 2006, &quot;I had always assumed that Raymond was gay, because he had a relationship with Robert Benevides for a very long time. Whether or not he had relationships with women, I had no idea. I did know that I had trouble keeping track of whether he was married or not in these stories. Raymond had the ability to mythologize himself, to some extent, and some of his stories about his past ... tended to grow as time went by.&quot;

===Hobbies and businesses===
Burr had many hobbies over the course of his life: cultivating orchids and collecting wine, art, stamps, and seashells. He was very fond of cooking. He was interested in flying, sailing, and fishing. According to &quot;A&amp;E Biography&quot;, Burr was an avid reader with a retentive memory. He was also among the earliest importers and breeders of Portuguese water dogs in the United States.

Burr developed his interest in cultivating and hybridizing orchids into a business with Benevides. Over 20 years, their company, Sea God Nurseries, had nurseries in Fiji, Hawaii, the Azores, and California, and was responsible for adding more than 1,500 new orchids to the worldwide catalog. Burr named one of them the &quot;Barbara Hale Orchid&quot; after his &quot;Perry Mason&quot; costar. Burr and Benevides cultivated Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and grapes for Port wine, as well as orchids, at Burr&#x27;s farm/estate in Sonoma County, California.

In 1965, Burr purchased Naitauba, a island in Fiji, rich in seashells. There, he and Benevides oversaw the raising of copra (coconut meat) and cattle, as well as orchids. Burr planned to retire there permanently. However, medical problems made that impossible and he sold the property in 1983.

===Philanthropy===
Burr was a well-known philanthropist. He gave enormous sums of money, including his salaries from the Perry Mason movies, to charity. He was also known for sharing his wealth with friends. He sponsored 26 foster children through the Foster Parents&#x27; Plan or Save the Children, many with the greatest medical needs. He gave money and some of his &quot;Perry Mason&quot; scripts to the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.

Burr was an early supporter of the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum in Sanibel, Florida, raising funds and chairing its first capital campaign. He also donated to the museum a large collection of Fijian cowries and cones from his island in Fiji.

In 1993, Sonoma State University awarded Burr an honorary doctorate. He supported medical and educational institutions in Denver, and in 1993, the University of Colorado awarded him an honorary doctorate for his acting work. Burr also founded and financed the American Fijian Foundation that funded academic research, including efforts to develop a dictionary of the language.

Burr made repeated trips on behalf of the United Service Organizations (USO). He toured both Korea and Vietnam during wartime and once spent six months touring Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. He sometimes organized his own troupe and toured bases both in the U.S. and overseas, often small installations that the USO did not serve, like one tour of Greenland, Baffin Island, Newfoundland and Labrador. Returning from Vietnam in 1965, he made a speaking tour of the U.S. to advocate an intensified war effort. As the war became more controversial, he modified his tone, called for more attention to the sacrifice of the troops, and said, &quot;My only position on the war is that I wish it were over.&quot; In October 1967, NBC aired &quot;Raymond Burr Visits Vietnam&quot;, a documentary of one of his visits. The reception was mixed. &quot;The impressions he came up with are neither weighty nor particularly revealing&quot;, wrote the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said Burr&#x27;s questions were &quot;intelligent and elicited some interesting replies&quot;.

Burr had a reputation in Hollywood as a thoughtful, generous man years before much of his more-visible philanthropic work. In 1960, Ray Collins, who portrayed Lt. Arthur Tragg on the original &quot;Perry Mason&quot; series, and who was by that time often ill and unable to remember all the lines he was supposed to speak, stated, &quot;There is nothing but kindness from our star, Ray Burr. Part of his life is dedicated to us, and that&#x27;s no bull. If there&#x27;s anything the matter with any of us, he comes around before anyone else and does what he can to help. He&#x27;s a great star—in the old tradition.&quot;

===Illness and death===

During the filming of his last &quot;Perry Mason&quot; movie in the spring of 1993, Burr fell ill. A Viacom spokesman told the media that the illness might be related to the renal cell carcinoma (malignant kidney tumor) that had been removed from Burr that February. It was determined that the cancer had spread to his liver and was at that point inoperable. Burr threw several &quot;goodbye parties&quot; before his death on September 12, 1993, at his Sonoma County ranch near Healdsburg. He was 76 years old.

The day after Burr&#x27;s death, American Bar Association President R. William Ide III released a statement: &quot;Raymond Burr&#x27;s portrayals of Perry Mason represented lawyers in a professional and dignified manner. ... Mr. Burr strove for such authenticity in his courtroom characterizations that we regard his passing as though we lost one of our own.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Perry Mason had been named second—after F. Lee Bailey, and before Abraham Lincoln, Thurgood Marshall, Janet Reno, Ben Matlock and Hillary Clinton—in a 1993 &quot;National Law Journal&quot; poll that asked Americans to name the attorney, fictional or not, they most admired.

Burr was interred with his parents and sister Geraldine (1920-2001) at Fraser Cemetery, New Westminster, British Columbia. On October 1, 1993, about 600 family members and friends paid tribute to Burr at a private memorial service at the Pasadena Playhouse.

Burr bequeathed his estate to Robert Benevides, and excluded all relatives, including a sister, nieces, and nephews. His will was challenged, without success, by the two children of his late brother, James E. Burr. Benevides&#x27; attorney said that tabloid reports of an estate worth $32 million were an overestimate.

==Accolades==
For his work in the TV series &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, Burr received the Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Continuing Character) in a Dramatic Series at the 11th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1959. Nominated again in 1960, he received his second Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Series (Lead) at the 13th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1961. Burr was named Favorite Male Performer, for &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, in &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine&#x27;s inaugural &quot;TV Guide&quot; Award readers poll in 1960. He also received the second annual award in 1961.

In 1960, Burr was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6656 Hollywood Boulevard. Burr received six Emmy nominations (1968–72) for his work in the TV series &quot;Ironside&quot;. He was nominated twice, in 1969 and 1972, for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama. A benefactor of legal education, Burr was principal speaker at the founders&#x27; banquet of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan, in June 1973. The Raymond Burr Award for Excellence in Criminal Law was established in his honor.

Burr was ranked No. 44 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time in 1996. Completed in 1996, a circular garden at the entrance to the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum in Sanibel, Florida, honored Burr for his role in establishing the museum. Burr was a trustee and an early supporter who chaired the museum&#x27;s first capital campaign, and made direct contributions from his own shell collection. A display about Burr as an actor, benefactor and collector opened in the museum&#x27;s Great Hall of Shells in 2012.

From 2000 to 2006, the Raymond Burr Performing Arts Society leased the historic Columbia Theatre from the city of New Westminster, and renamed it the Raymond Burr Performing Arts Centre. Although the nonprofit organization hoped to raise funds to renovate and expand the venue, its contract was not renewed. The group was a failed bidder when the theater was sold in 2011.

In 2008, Canada Post issued a postage stamp in its &quot;Canadians in Hollywood&quot; series featuring Burr. Burr received the 2009 Canadian Legends Award and a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009. A 2014 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that examined how Netflix categorized nearly 77,000 different personalized genres found that Burr was rated as the favorite actor by Netflix users, with the greatest number of dedicated microgenres.

<text>Perry Mason is a fictional character, an American criminal defense lawyer who is the main character in works of detective fiction written by Erle Stanley Gardner. Perry Mason features in 82 novels and four short stories, all of which involve a client being charged with murder, usually involving a preliminary hearing or jury trial. Typically, Mason establishes his client&#x27;s innocence by finding the real murderer. The character was inspired by famed Los Angeles criminal defense attorney Earl Rogers.

The character of Perry Mason was adapted for motion pictures and a long-running radio series. These were followed by the best known adaptation, the CBS television series &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (1957–1966) starring Raymond Burr. A second television series, &quot;The New Perry Mason&quot; starring Monte Markham, ran from 1973 to 1974; and 30 Perry Mason television films ran from 1985 to 1995, with Burr reprising the role of Mason in 26 of them up to his death in 1993. A third television series, HBO&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot; starring Matthew Rhys, aired from 2020 to 2023.

The Perry Mason series ranks third in the top ten best selling book series. In 2015, the American Bar Association&#x27;s publishing imprint, Ankerwycke, began reissuing Gardner&#x27;s Perry Mason books, which had been out of print in the United States.

==Character==
As a child, Gardner read the magazine &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;, published by the Perry Mason Company - a name Gardner later borrowed for his fictional attorney. Gardner provided more information about Mason&#x27;s character in earlier novels while knowledge of his character is largely taken for granted in the later works, the television series and movies. In the first novel (&quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot;, 1933), Mason describes himself in the following way:

Gardner depicts Mason as a lawyer who fights hard for his clients and who enjoys unusual, difficult or nearly hopeless cases. He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In &quot;The Case of the Caretaker&#x27;s Cat&quot; (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: &quot;You&#x27;re a better detective than you are a lawyer. When you turn your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth.&quot; In &quot;The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink&quot; (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer&#x27;s unusual tactics says: &quot;Mr. Mason...from time to time you seem to find yourself in predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients&#x27; interests.&quot;

Another frequent antagonist, Lieutenant Arthur Tragg of the homicide squad, has a discussion with Mason about his approach to the law. Mason is recovering from having been poisoned, and Tragg is investigating. In &quot;The Case of the Drowsy Mosquito&quot; (1943) he says:

Other than what is learned of his character from the novels themselves, very little is known about Perry Mason. His family, personal life, background, and education are not depicted, although according to the first chapter of &quot;The Case of the Sleepwalker&#x27;s Niece&quot; (1935), his astrological sign was Leo. Mason has a professional relationship with Paul Drake. Della Street is Mason&#x27;s only evident (though not sharply delineated) romantic interest. It is known that he lives in an apartment because he is occasionally awakened from sleep to go to his office; he does not entertain anyone at home. His tastes in food are known because many scenes take place in restaurants, and that he is an excellent driver as shown by his participation in the occasional car chase. Other than those sketchy facts, there is so little physical description of him that the reader is not even sure what he looks like.

The 1930s films were not closely based on the character of Perry Mason as revealed in the books, and contain plot and character developments which are not accepted as canonical in the remainder of the books and adaptations. For instance, in one film, Mason marries his longtime secretary Della Street, while Paul Drake turns into comic sidekick Spudsy Drake.

Likewise the TV series diverges at times significantly from the books, which was a practical necessity considering that there were only about 80 Perry Mason novels written altogether and over 270 episodes of the TV series. Thus there was a need for a great deal of invented material, background, plots, and characters – none of which material Gardner incorporated into his ongoing series of Perry Mason novels. In fact, Gardner would write over 30 more Perry Mason novels from between 1957 when the TV series began up until his death in 1970.

The television series contains some hints of what Mason did in the past. In &quot;The Case of the Misguided Missile&quot;, he says that he served in the Navy on Ulithi atoll during World War II. In &quot;The Case of the Travelling Treasure&quot;, he says that he served aboard a minesweeper.

The HBO series presents him as being a private detective, becoming a lawyer by necessity in order to salvage the case he&#x27;s working on. In this series, he lives on what remains of a dairy farm which has been in his family for at least two prior generations. He is also a veteran of World War I, having been discharged with a &quot;blue ticket&quot; (i.e. with negative connotations), probably because he mercy-killed some comrades who were about to die from a poison gas attack which they were too severely wounded to escape. Episode 1 shows Mason with a tattoo of the Cross of Lorraine with the number 79 and the inscription &quot;infantry&quot;, indicating he was an infantryman in the 79th Division whose emblem of the cross signifies its service in France during the war. Mason is also an alcoholic, divorced father who is struggling to maintain ownership of his deceased parents&#x27; farm.

==Novels==

Julian Symons noted that Erle Stanley Gardner &quot;had spent more than twenty years practicing law in California, and the knowledge he gained was put to good use in the Perry Mason stories, which hinge on points of law, forensic medicine or science as clever as a watch mechanism … and also the total lack of characterization&quot;.

While the Mason novels were largely a form of pulp fiction of the sort that began Gardner&#x27;s writing career, they are unusual in that the whodunit mysteries usually involved two solutions: a very plausible but inaccurate one in which the authorities believed (wherein Mason&#x27;s client was guilty) and an entirely alternative (and true) explanation, wherein Mason&#x27;s client was innocent and another party had committed the crime. Almost always, the second half of each novel is devoted to a courtroom scene, during which Mason arrives at the alternative explanation and proves it to the satisfaction of the court. &quot;It is perfectly true that our author works to formula; in one sense, the plot never varies,&quot; wrote Jacques Barzun. &quot;Having said this, one must add that the variety of persons and circumstances and the ingenuity in contriving the details that Gardner dreamed up in his dozens of cases are astonishing and entrancing.&quot;

A hallmark of the stories is that as soon as Perry Mason (with the assistance of his secretary Della Street and private investigator Paul Drake) accepts a case, he will juggle the evidence using unusual (even bizarre) tactics to mislead the police – but (except for the very earliest novels) always in an ethical fashion:
The influence of the television series has given the general public the impression that Mason is highly ethical. In the earliest novels, however, Mason was not above skulduggery to win a case. In &quot;The Case of the Counterfeit Eye&quot; (1935) he breaks the law several times, including manufacturing false evidence (glass eyes). Mason manipulates evidence and witnesses, resulting in the acquittal of the murderer in &quot;The Case of the Howling Dog&quot; (1934). &quot;The Case of the Curious Bride&quot; (1934) is 

In the later novels, the only crime which he can be seen to commit might be illegal entry, when he and Paul Drake are searching for evidence. And even then, he would expect to put up a strong and effective defense leading to an acquittal. Hamilton Burger is constantly under the impression that Mason has done something illegal, but is never able to prove it. Gardner prefaced many of his later novels with tributes to coroners and forensic pathologists whose work was instrumental to solving cases. Gardner inserts his ideas about the importance of proper autopsies into many of his Mason novels. In &quot;The Case of the Fugitive Nurse,&quot; for instance, close scrutiny of dental records in the identification of burned bodies is a key point. In that same story, the possible use of additives to track illegal resale of medical narcotics is examined.

Critic Russel B. Nye saw a pattern in Gardner&#x27;s novels, calling them as formal as Japanese Noh drama. He described fairly rigid plot points:
* Attorney Perry Mason&#x27;s case is introduced.
* Mason and his crew investigate.
* Mason&#x27;s client is accused of a crime.
* Further investigations ensue.
* The trial begins.
* In a courtroom coup, Mason introduces new evidence and often elicits a confession from the lawbreaker.

The Perry Mason series ranks third in the top ten best selling book series, with sales of 300 million.

In June 2015, the American Bar Association announced that its new publishing imprint, Ankerwycke, would reissue Gardner&#x27;s Perry Mason novels. &quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Sulky Girl&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Lucky Legs&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Howling Dog&quot; and &quot;The Case of the Curious Bride&quot; were the first five novels announced for trade paperback release. The Perry Mason books had been out of print in the United States.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
Warner Bros. released a series of six Perry Mason films in the 1930s.
* &quot;The Case of the Howling Dog&quot; (1934), with Warren William as Perry Mason and Helen Trenholme as Della Street.
* &quot;The Case of the Curious Bride&quot; (1935), with Warren William and Claire Dodd as Della Street. Notable for the first-released American screen appearance of Errol Flynn as the corpse, who is seen alive but not speaking in a brief flashback.
* &quot;The Case of the Lucky Legs&quot; (1935), with Warren William and Genevieve Tobin as Della Street.
* &quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot; (1936), with Warren William and Claire Dodd as Della Street Mason.
* &quot;The Case of the Black Cat&quot; (1936) (from &quot;The Case of the Caretaker&#x27;s Cat&quot; [1935]), with Ricardo Cortez as Perry Mason and June Travis as Della Street.
* &quot;The Case of the Stuttering Bishop&quot; (1937), with Donald Woods as Perry Mason and Ann Dvorak as Della Street.

The six Perry Mason films are available on DVD as a single-set release from the Warner Bros. Archive Collection.

The 1940 Warner Bros. film, &quot;Granny Get Your Gun&quot;, was loosely based on the 1937 Perry Mason novel &quot;The Case of the Dangerous Dowager&quot;. May Robson stars as Minerva Hatton. The film does not include Perry Mason or any of the regular characters.

===Radio===

Perry Mason was adapted for radio as a 15-minute daily crime series that aired from 1943 to 1955 on CBS Radio. It had little in common with the usual portrayal of Mason, so much so that Gardner withdrew his support for a TV version of the daytime serial that began airing on CBS in 1956. The general theme of the radio series was continued, with a different title and characters, as &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;.

===Television===
====&quot;Perry Mason&quot; (1957–1966)====
The best-known incarnation of Perry Mason came in the form of a CBS TV series simply titled &quot;Perry Mason&quot; which ran from 1957 to 1966, with Raymond Burr in the title role. The series also featured Barbara Hale as Della Street, William Hopper as Paul Drake, William Talman as Hamilton Burger and Ray Collins as Lt. Tragg. The entire series has been released on DVD and reruns are a staple in syndication.

Paramount+ has made available most of the episodes from seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 on its website for streaming.

====&quot;The New Perry Mason&quot; (1973–1974)====

Several years after &quot;Perry Mason&quot; was cancelled, a new series, &quot;The New Perry Mason&quot;, aired in 1973 featuring Monte Markham in the title role. A total of 15 episodes aired before being cancelled halfway through its first season.

====Television films (1985–1995)====

American television producers Dean Hargrove and Fred Silverman resurrected the Perry Mason character in a series of television films for NBC beginning in 1985. The two surviving stars of the CBS-TV series, Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale, reprised their roles as Mason and Della Street. In the first telefilm, &quot;Perry Mason Returns&quot;, Mason is an appellate court judge who resigns his position to successfully defend his secretary Della on murder charges. William Katt, Hale&#x27;s son, was cast as Paul Drake, Jr. William Hopper, who played private investigator Paul Drake in the original TV series, had died years earlier; Hopper&#x27;s photograph appears on Paul Drake Jr.&#x27;s desk. In the later TV movies, Mason used the services of attorney Ken Malansky, played by William R. Moses.

The Perry Mason series of TV movies continued until Burr&#x27;s death from kidney cancer in 1993. &quot;The Case of the Killer Kiss&quot; was Burr&#x27;s final portrayal of Mason. The film aired after his death, and was dedicated to Burr&#x27;s memory. Thereafter, the title of the series was changed to &quot;A Perry Mason Mystery&quot; and starred either Paul Sorvino or Hal Holbrook as lawyers and friends of Mason. Hale and Moses continued in their roles; Mason was ostensibly out of town.

====&quot;Perry Mason&quot; (2020)====

In August 2016, HBO announced a potential new series. In August 2017 a change in the writing staff for the project was announced, with Rolin Jones and Ron Fitzgerald taking over for Nic Pizzolatto. In January 2019, Robert Downey Jr. announced on his Twitter page that Matthew Rhys would be portraying Perry Mason in the new production; Downey was originally going to portray Mason, but was forced to bow out due to scheduling conflicts. The HBO revival and reboot adapted its setting to Great Depression-era Los Angeles, some twenty years earlier than the CBS show (but in line with the earliest novels by Gardner). It features John Lithgow and Tatiana Maslany in additional roles.
This miniseries was created with a budget of around $74.3 million and released its first episode on June 21, 2020. In July 2020, HBO announced that the mini-series had been picked up for a second season, and that the show would become a regular series.

===Other adaptations===
The Perry Mason character has appeared in comic books and a short-lived (October 16, 1950– June 21, 1952) comic strip. He was also the inspiration for &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; (1986) by James Cummins, a book-length collection of sestinas.

In 2008, &quot;The Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air&quot; began producing a series of full-cast audio theater dramatizations of Gardner&#x27;s Perry Mason novels, adapted by M. J. Elliott.

==Regular characters==
Recurring characters in the Perry Mason stories include the following:
* Perry Mason: Los Angeles attorney introduced in the 1933 novel, &quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot;.
* Della Street: Mason&#x27;s confidential secretary introduced in the 1933 novel, &quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot;.

Holcomb in the novels is portrayed as a mean, derby-wearing, cigar-smoking thug. In at least one novel, it&#x27;s implied that Paul Drake has beaten him in a fistfight before, and is quite willing to do so again, making Holcomb tread carefully around him.

==Influence==
In her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2009, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor prefaced her remarks on the role of the prosecutor by saying that she was inspired by watching the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television series as a child:

I was influenced so greatly by a television show in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was &quot;Perry Mason&quot; … In one of the episodes, at the end of the episode … Perry said to the prosecutor, &quot;It must cause you some pain having expended all that effort in your case to have the charges dismissed.&quot; And the prosecutor looked up and said, &quot;No. My job as a prosecutor is do justice and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and when an innocent man is not.&quot; And I thought to myself that&#x27;s quite amazing to be able to serve that role …

The Perry Mason novels inspired Robert M. Bell, former Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals, to become a lawyer. &quot;I used to read those growing up,&quot; he recalled in 2012. &quot;I got the sense that a lawyer could do good things for folk and was important to our community. That’s what I wanted to do.&quot;

==Cultural references==
A British Solicitor references many Perry Mason novels in the BBC television show &#x27;May to December&#x27; 1989. He even has a picture of Raymond Burr in his office with whom he talks. Raymond Burr portrays Perry Mason in the 1957 television series.

<text>A private investigator (often abbreviated to PI and informally called a private eye), a private detective, an inquiry agent or informally a  is a person who can be hired by individuals or groups to undertake investigatory law services. Private investigators often work for attorneys in civil and criminal cases.

==History==

In 1833, Eugène François Vidocq, a French soldier, criminal, and privateer, founded the first known private detective agency, &quot;Le Bureau des Renseignements Universels pour le commerce et l&#x27;Industrie&quot; (&quot;The Office of Universal Information For Commerce and Industry&quot;) and hired ex-convicts. Much of what private investigators did in the early days was to act as the police in matters for which their clients felt the police were not equipped or willing to do. Official law enforcement tried many times to shut it down. In 1842, police arrested him in suspicion of unlawful imprisonment and taking money on false pretences after he had solved an embezzlement case. Vidocq later suspected that it had been a set-up. He was sentenced to five years and fined 3,000 francs, but the Court of Appeals released him. Vidocq is credited with having introduced record-keeping, criminology, and ballistics to criminal investigation. He made the first plaster casts of shoe impressions. He created indelible ink and unalterable bond paper with his printing company. His form of anthropometrics is still partially used by French police. He is also credited for philanthropic pursuits – he claimed he never informed on anyone who had stolen for real need.

In the United Kingdom, Charles Frederick Field set up an enquiry office upon his retirement from the Metropolitan Police in 1852. Field became a friend of Charles Dickens, and the latter wrote articles about him. In 1862, one of his employees, the Hungarian Ignatius Paul Pollaky, left him and set up a rival agency. Although little-remembered today, Pollaky&#x27;s fame at the time was such that he was mentioned in various books of the 1870s and immortalized as &quot;Paddington&quot; Pollaky for his &quot;keen penetration&quot; in the 1881 comic opera, &quot;Patience&quot;.
In the United States, Allan Pinkerton established the Pinkerton National Detective Agency – a private detective agency – in 1850. Pinkerton became famous when he foiled a plot to assassinate then President-elect Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Pinkerton&#x27;s agents performed services which ranged from undercover investigations and detection of crimes, to plant protection and armed security. At the height of its existence, the number of Pinkerton National Detective Agency active agents and reserves rivaled the number of active soldiers and reserves in the United States Army. Allan Pinkerton hired Kate Warne in 1856 as a private detective, making her the first female private detective in America.

A larger role for this new private investigative industry was to assist companies in labor disputes. Some early private investigators provided armed guards to act as a private militia. During the union unrest in the US in the late 19th century, industrialists would hire Pinkerton agents as undercover operatives to infiltrate and disrupt union activity or serve as armed guards for factories. In the aftermath of the Homestead Riot of 1892, several states passed so-called &quot;anti-Pinkerton&quot; laws restricting the importation of private security guards during union strikes. The federal Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893 continues to prohibit an &quot;individual employed by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, or similar organization&quot; from being employed by &quot;the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia.&quot;

Pinkerton agents were also hired to track western outlaws Jesse James, the Reno brothers, and the Wild Bunch, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
== Employment ==
Many private detectives/investigators with special academic and practical experience often work with defense attorneys on capital punishment and other criminal defense cases. Others are insurance investigators who investigate suspicious claims. Before the advent of no-fault divorce, many private investigators sought evidence of adultery or other conduct within marriage to establish grounds for a divorce. Despite the lack of legal necessity for such evidence in many jurisdictions, according to press reports, collecting evidence of spouses&#x27; and partners&#x27; adultery or other &quot;bad behaviour&quot; is still one of their most profitable undertakings, as the stakes being fought over now are child custody, alimony, or marital property disputes.

Private investigators can also perform due diligence for an investor considering investing with an investment group, fund manager, or other high-risk business or investment venture. This could help the prospective investor avoid being the victim of fraud. A licensed and experienced investigator could reveal the investment is risky and/or the investor has a suspicious background. This is called investigative due diligence, and is becoming more prevalent in the 21st century with the public reports of large-scale Ponzi schemes and other fraudulent investment vehicles.

There are also cases of corrupt private detectives who, at times, have been known to work for criminals such as stalkers and crime bosses to track down escaped victims, rival criminals and/or witnesses that have gone into hiding or to gather compromising evidence against witnesses, informants, prosecutors and/or police investigators that could be used in upcoming trials.

==Responsibilities==
Private investigators also engage in a variety of work not often associated with the industry in the mind of the public. For example, many are involved in process serving, the personal delivery of summons, subpoenas, and other legal documents to parties in a legal case. The tracing of absconding debtors can also form a large part of a PI&#x27;s work load. Many agencies specialize in a particular field of expertise. For example, some PI agencies deal only in tracing.

A handful of firms specialize in technical surveillance counter-measures, sometimes called electronic counter measures, which is the locating and dealing with unwanted forms of electronic surveillance (for example, a bugged boardroom for industrial espionage purposes). This niche service is typically conducted by those with backgrounds in intelligence/counterintelligence, executive protection, and a small number from law enforcement entities whose duties included the covert installation of eavesdropping devices as a tool in organized crime, terrorism and narco-trafficking investigations. 

Other PIs, also known as corporate investigators, specialize in corporate matters, including antifraud work, loss prevention, internal investigations of employee misconduct (such as Equal Employment Opportunities violations and sexual harassment), the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets, antipiracy, copyright infringement investigations, due diligence investigations, malware and cyber criminal activity, and computer forensics work. Some PIs act as professional witnesses where they observe situations with a view to reporting the actions or lack of them to a court or to gather evidence in antisocial behavior.

==Undercover investigator==
An undercover investigator, undercover detective, or undercover agent is a person who conducts investigations of suspected or confirmed criminal activity while impersonating a disinterested third party. Undercover investigators often infiltrate a suspected insurgent group, posing as a person interested in purchasing illegal goods or services with the ultimate aim of obtaining information about their assigned target.

Many undercover investigators carry hidden cameras and recorders strapped to their bodies to help them document their investigations. The period of the investigation could last for several months, or in some extreme cases, years. Due to the dangerous nature of the job, their real identities are typically kept secret throughout their active careers.
Economic investigations, business intelligence and information on competitors, security advice, special security services information, criminal investigation, investigations background, and profile polygraph tests are all typical examples of such a role.

Certain types of undercover investigators, depending on their employer, will investigate allegations of abuse of workman&#x27;s compensation. Those claiming to be injured are often investigated and recorded with a hidden camera/recorder. This is then presented in court or to the client who paid for the investigation.

== Around the world ==
Many jurisdictions require PIs to be licensed. Depending on local laws, they may or may not carry a firearm. Equipment can vary greatly, but generally involves a wide variety of surveillance equipment and recording devices. While PIs may investigate criminal matters, they typically do not hold any law enforcement authority by virtue of the position, regardless of licensure. Private investigators’ authority is usually identical to other citizens’ (off-duty or retired law enforcement officers serving as a PI may retain their police powers at all times, depending on the jurisdiction). They are expected to keep detailed notes and to be prepared to testify in court regarding any of their observations on behalf of their clients, irregular hours may also be required when performing surveillance work. Great care is required to remain within the scope of the law; otherwise, the private investigator may face criminal charges. However, there are also cases around the world, of corrupt or rogue private investigators who have obtained people&#x27;s private data and information through illegal means. These include phone hacking, pretexting, identity theft and other illegal means of accessing government, insurance and police databases to obtain highly sensitive private information on their targets.

=== Australia===
Private investigators in Australia must be licensed by the licensing authority relevant to the state where they are located. This applies to all states except the Australian Capital Territory. Companies offering investigation services must also hold a business licence and all their operatives must hold individual licences. Generally, the licences are administered and regulated by the state police; however, in some states, this can also be managed by other government agencies. The evidence collected by private investigators must adhere to strict rules of admissibility. If proper protocols are not followed during the investigation services, the evidence may be deemed inadmissible in the court of law.

To become registered in New South Wales requires a Class 2E licence, which can be applied for through the NSW Fair Trading website.
The Australian Capital Territory does not require PIs to be licensed, although they are still bound by legislation. PIs working in the ACT cannot enter the NSW area without a CAPI license, else they will be in breach of the law.
In Queensland, a private investigator need to be licensed under the Queensland Government and apply for a private investigator licence by completing an application for a security provider licence. Applicant will need to have a criminal history check and submit fingerprint.

===Canada===
Private investigators in Canada are licensed at the provincial level by the appropriate body. For instance, in the province of Ontario, private investigators are licensed and regulated by the Ministry of Community Safety &amp; Correctional Services (MCSCS). In the province of Alberta, private investigators are licensed and regulated by the Alberta Justice and Solicitor General. Similar licensing requirements apply in other provinces and territories of Canada. As per the Ontario text of the Private Security and Investigative Services Act of 2005, private investigators are forbidden from referring to themselves as detective or private detective. In order to become a licensed private investigator, you must be 18 years of age or older in Ontario (in other Provinces and territories of Canada the eligible age to work may be higher); have a clean criminal record or obtain a waiver; and submit a correctly completed application for a license. You are required to complete 50-hours of basic training with an accredited source such as a university, college, or through private agencies licensed to administer the course. Upon completion of basic training, individuals are required to write and pass the basic test to obtain a private investigator&#x27;s license

===UK===
In 2001, the Private Security Industry Act empowered the Security Industry Authority (SIA) to introduce licensing for private investigators in the United Kingdom. Although the SIA regulates various other sectors of the private security industry, the specific licensing framework for private investigators has never been fully implemented, and remains unimplemented as of January 2025. As a result, there is no government-backed licensing scheme for private investigators in the UK.

The SIA has periodically announced potential dates for when private investigator licensing might take effect, including a proposal for discussion in Parliament in May 2015. However, no formal scheme has emerged. In December 2014, Corporate Livewire published an article by a UK private investigator at BAR Investigations, discussing the implications of the unimplemented licensing regime and other industry concerns. The cost of hiring a private investigator in the UK varies according to the complexity of the inquiry and the investigator’s level of experience, with typical daily rates ranging from £200 to £500.

===United States===
Private investigators in the United States may or may not be licensed or registered by a government licensing authority or state police of the state where they are located. Licensing varies from state to state and can range from: a) no state license required; b) city or state business license required (such as in five states (Idaho, Alaska, Mississippi, South Dakota, and Wyoming); c) to needing several years of experience and licensing-related training classes and testing (as is the case with Virginia, West Virginia, and California). In some states (Indiana, Michigan, Rhode Island), work experience can be substituted with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in criminal justice. In many states, companies offering investigation services must hold an agency license, and all of their investigators or detectives must hold individual licenses or registrations; furthermore, certain states such as Washington have separate classes of licensing for roles such as trainers of private investigators, individual private investigators, and private investigative agencies. A few states require character references from people not related to the applicant by blood or marriage (3 in Massachusetts, 5 in Minnesota). A few reciprocity agreements allow a US private investigator working in one state to continue work in another for a limited time without getting a separate license, but not all states participate in these agreements.

In 1887, Colorado became the first state in the union to institute licensing requirements for private investigators. Section 12-21-101 of the 1973 edition of Colorado Revised Statutes mandated license for &quot;detective business&quot;, section 12-21-109 declared unlicensed operation a misdemeanor. However, on February 7, 1977, after El Paso County challenged a local security company Ro&#x27;Mar Investigation and Security, Inc.&#x27;s right to conduct investigations without a license, the Colorado Supreme Court deemed the law unconstitutional in People v. Ro&#x27;Mar, citing that the statute did not define a &quot;detective business&quot; and the Secretary of State lacked the ability to define it by rule. Following this, several private investigators formed Professional Private Investigators Association of Colorado (PPIAC) in order to try to get the licensing laws reinstated, but the bills died in the General Assembly. Four reviews carried out by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies in 1985, 1987, 2000 and 2006 recommended against state regulation due to the lack to harm to consumers. On June 10, 2011, Governor John Hickenlooper signed into law Colorado House Bill 1195, which reinstated licenses for private investigators on voluntary basis effective July 1, 2012. A license applicant would have to be of 21 years of age or older, hold United States citizenship and have at least 4,000 hours of work experience as an investigator or part of a local, state or federal law enforcement agency; or 2,000 hours with post-secondary education.

On June 6, 2014, Hickenlooper signed into law Senate Bill 133, which effective June 1, 2015, made licensure mandatory. This split the licenses into two categories: Class I, requiring the applicant to be 21 years of age or older, hold United States citizenship and pass the Colorado Jurisprudence Exam. Class II requires in addition to Class I requirements a minimum of 4,000 hours of work experience as an investigator or part of a local, state or federal law enforcement agency. In 2019, following a review, the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies&#x27; Office of Policy, Research and Regulatory Reform suggested licensure requirement elimination, predicting &quot;little to no consumer harm&quot;. In June 2020, Governor Jared Polis vetoed House Bill 1207 to keep licensure requirements, causing the licensure requirements to expire on August 31, 2021.

Florida has 3 types of licenses: Class CC for private investigator intern, C for private investigator, and MA for manager of a private investigative agency. As Class C license requires at least two years of experience, most applicants start with Class CC, which allows them to work under a sponsorship of a licensed Class C investigator.

For a Private Investigator License in New York, an investigator needs three years of verifiable experience, and to pass a NY State Department of State Division of licensing Services exam.

In 1893 a federal law was passed explicitly barring the government from employing the Pinkerton Detective Agency or a similar agency.

=== Vietnam ===
Current Vietnamese law stipulates that investigation is the authority of state agencies. According to the Investment Law and Decrees 108/2006/NĐ-CP and 52/2008/NĐ-CP, businesses providing security services are not allowed to conduct investigations or private detective activities in any form. However, due to social demand, private detective offices have rapidly developed.

Recently, private detective services have grown significantly, primarily in the form of information provision. Common services in Vietnam include information investigation, address finding, surveillance, phone number tracking, information verification, missing person searches, DNA testing, and counterfeit goods investigation. The cost of hiring a private investigator is around one million VND per day. For cases involving infidelity surveillance or searching for missing children, clients may pay tens of millions of VND per contract. Additionally, some internet service providers have shown signs of participating in this service. In general, Vietnam needs a clear legal framework for the private detective profession. In reality, many private detectives operate illegally, leading to calls for proper regulation of this profession.

==Fiction==

The PI genre in fiction dates to Edgar Allan Poe, who created the character C. Auguste Dupin in the 1840s. Dupin, an amateur crime-solver residing in Paris, appeared in three Poe stories. In addition, Sherlock Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1880s, is arguably the most prominent private investigator in fiction.

<doc id="62131" wikidata="Q41554" url="?curid=62131" title="Nicolas Poussin">
<text>Nicolas Poussin (, , ; June 1594 – 19 November 1665) was a French painter who was a leading painter of the classical French Baroque style, although he spent most of his working life in Rome. Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors. He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscape in his paintings. His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul Cézanne.

Details of Poussin&#x27;s artistic training are somewhat obscure. Around 1612 he traveled to Paris, where he studied under minor masters and completed his earliest surviving works. His enthusiasm for the Italian works he saw in the royal collections in Paris motivated him to travel to Rome in 1624, where he studied the works of Renaissance and Baroque painters—especially Raphael, who had a powerful influence on his style. He befriended a number of artists who shared his classicizing tendencies, and met important patrons, such as Cardinal Francesco Barberini and the antiquarian Cassiano dal Pozzo. The commissions Poussin received for modestly scaled paintings of religious, mythological, and historical subjects allowed him to develop his individual style in works such as &quot;The Death of Germanicus&quot;, &quot;The Massacre of the Innocents&quot;, and the first of his two series of the &quot;Seven Sacraments&quot;.

He was persuaded to return to France in 1640 to be First Painter to the King but, dissatisfied with the overwhelming workload and the court intrigues, returned permanently to Rome after a little more than a year. Among the important works from his later years are &quot;Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun&quot;, &quot;Landscape with Hercules and Cacus&quot;, and &quot;The Seasons&quot;.

==Biography==
=== Early years – Les Andelys and Paris ===
Nicolas Poussin&#x27;s early biographer was his friend Giovanni Pietro Bellori, who relates that Poussin was born near Les Andelys in Normandy and that he received an education that included some Latin, which would stand him in good stead. Another early friend and biographer, André Félibien, reported that &quot;He was busy without cease filling his sketchbooks with an infinite number of different figures which only his imagination could produce.&quot; His early sketches attracted the notice of Quentin Varin, who passed some time in Andelys, but there is no mention by his biographers that he had a formal training in Varin&#x27;s studio, though his later works showed the influence of Varin, particularly by their storytelling, accuracy of facial expression, finely painted drapery and rich colors. His parents apparently opposed a painting career for him, and In or around 1612, at the age of eighteen, he ran away to Paris.

He arrived in Paris during the regency of Marie de Medici, when art was flourishing as a result of the royal commissions given by Marie de Medici for the decoration of her palace, and by the rise of wealthy Paris merchants who bought art. There was also a substantial market for paintings in the redecoration of churches outside Paris destroyed during the French Wars of Religion, which had recently ended, and for the numerous convents in Paris and other cities. However, Poussin was not a member of the powerful guild of master painters and sculptors, which had a monopoly on most art commissions and brought lawsuits against outsiders like Poussin who tried to break into the profession.

His early sketches gained him a place in the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin. Afterward, he is thought to have studied for one month in the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand&#x27;s inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin. Moreover, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, in which several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the &quot;valet de chambre&quot; of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.

He first tried to travel to Rome in 1617 or 1618, but made it only as far as Florence, where, as his biographer Bellori reported, &quot;as a result of some sort of accident, he returned to France.&quot; On his return, he began making paintings for Paris churches and convents. In 1622 made another attempt to go to Rome, but went only as far as Lyon before returning. In the summer of the same year, he received his first important commission: the Order of Jesuits requested a series of six large paintings to honor the canonization of their founder, Saint Francis Xavier. The originality and energy of these paintings (since lost) brought him a series of important commissions.

Giambattista Marino, the court poet to Marie de Medici, employed him to make a series of fifteen drawings, eleven illustrating Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and four illustrating battle scenes from Roman history. The &quot;Marino drawings&quot;, now at Windsor Castle, are among the earliest identifiable works of Poussin. Marino&#x27;s influence led to a commission for some decoration of Marie de Medici&#x27;s residence, the Luxembourg Palace, then a commission from the first Archbishop of Paris, Jean-François de Gondi, for a painting of the death of the Virgin (since lost) for the Archbishop&#x27;s family chapel at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. Marino took him into his household, and, when he returned to Rome in 1623, invited Poussin to join him. Poussin remained in Paris to finish his earlier commissions, then arrived to Rome in the spring of 1624.

=== First residence in Rome (1624–1640) ===

Poussin was thirty when he arrived in Rome in 1624. The new Pope, Urban VIII, elected in 1623, was determined to maintain the position of Rome as the artistic capital of Europe, and artists from around the world gathered there. Poussin could visit the churches and convents to study the works of Raphael and other Renaissance painters, as well as the more recent works of Carracci, Guido Reni and Caravaggio (whose work Poussin detested, saying that Caravaggio was born to destroy painting). He studied the art of painting nudes at the Academy of Domenichino, and frequented the Academy of Saint Luke, which brought together the leading painters in Rome, and whose head in 1624 was another French painter, Simon Vouet, who offered lodging to Poussin.

Poussin became acquainted with other artists in Rome and tended to befriend those with classicizing artistic leanings: the French sculptor François Duquesnoy whom he lodged with in 1626 in via dei Maroniti; the French artist Jacques Stella; Claude Lorraine; Domenichino; Andrea Sacchi; and joined an informal academy of artists and patrons opposed to the current Baroque style that formed around Joachim von Sandrart. Rome also offered Poussin a flourishing art market and an introduction to an important number of art patrons. Through Marino, he was introduced to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the brother of the new Pope, and to Cassiano dal Pozzo, the Cardinal&#x27;s secretary and a passionate scholar of ancient Rome and Greece, who both later became his important patrons. The new art collectors demanded a different format of paintings; instead of large altarpieces and decoration for palaces, they wanted smaller-size religious paintings for private devotion or picturesque landscapes, mythological and history paintings.

The early years of Poussin in Rome were difficult. His patron Marino departed Rome for Naples in May 1624, shortly after Poussin arrived, and died there in 1625. His other major sponsor, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, was named a papal legate to Spain and also departed soon afterwards, taking Cassiano dal Pozzo with him. Poussin became ill with syphilis, but refused to go to the hospital, where the care was extremely poor, and he was unable to paint for months. He survived by selling the paintings he had for a few ecus. Thanks to the assistance of a chef, Jacques Dughet, whose family took him in and cared for him, he largely recovered by 1629, and on 1 September 1630 he married Anne-Marie Dughet, the daughter of Dughet. His two brothers-in-law were artists, and Gaspard Dughet later took Poussin&#x27;s surname.

Cardinal Barberini and Cassiano dal Pozzo returned to Rome in 1626, and by their patronage Poussin received two major commissions. In 1627, Poussin painted &quot;The Death of Germanicus&quot; (Minneapolis Institute of Arts) for Cardinal Barberini. The painting&#x27;s erudite use of ancient textual and visual sources (the &quot;Histories&quot; of Tacitus and the Meleager sarcophagus), stoic restraint and pictorial clarity established Poussin&#x27;s reputation as a major artist. In 1628, he was living on the via Paolino (Babuino) with Jean le Maire.

The success of the Germanicus led to an even more prestigious commission in 1628 for an altarpiece depicting the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Erasmus&quot;, for the Erasmus Chapel in the basilica of St. Peter&#x27;s (now in the Vatican Pinacoteca). The Fabricca di San Pietro had originally awarded the commission to Pietro da Cortona, who had produced only preliminary designs for the altarpiece when he was unexpectedly transferred to another project. Thanks to Cassiano dal Pozzo&#x27;s influence, Poussin was chosen to paint the Saint Erasmus altarpiece, following Pietro da Cortona&#x27;s original design.

With its plunging diagonal composition and high narrative drama, the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Erasmus&quot; is Poussin&#x27;s most overtly &quot;baroque&quot; work. Despite its adherence to the pictorial idiom of the day, for unknown reasons, the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Erasmus&quot; seems to have met with official displeasure and generated no further papal commissions. This disappointment, and the loss of a competition for a fresco cycle in San Luigi dei Francesi, convinced Poussin abandon the pursuit of large-scale, public commissions and the burdensome competitions, content restrictions, and political machinations they entailed. Instead, Poussin would re-orient his art towards private collectors, for whom he could work more slowly, with increasing control over subject matter and style.

Along with Cardinal Barberini and Cassiano dal Pozzo, for whom he painted the first &quot;Seven&quot; &quot;Sacraments&quot; series&quot;,&quot; Poussin&#x27;s early private patrons included the Chanoine Gian Maria Roscioli, who bought &quot;The Young Pyrrhus Saved&quot; and several other important works; Cardinal Rospigliosi, for whom he painted the second version of &quot;The Shepherds of Arcadia&quot;; and Cardinal Luigi Omodei, who received the &quot;Triumphs of Flora&quot; (–32, Louvre). He painted the &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; for the banker Vincenzo Giustiniani; the jewel thief and art swindler, Fabrizio Valguarnera, bought &quot;Plague of Ashdod&quot; and commissioned &quot;The Empire of Flora&quot;. He also received his first French commissions from the Marechal de Crequi, the French envoy to Italy, later, from Cardinal de Richelieu for a series of &quot;Bacchanales&quot;.

Buoyed by this commercial success, Poussin bought a life interest in a small house on Via Paolina (Babuino) for his wife and himself in 1632 and entered his most productive period. His house was at the foot of Trinité des Monts, near the city gate, where other foreigners and artists lived; its exact location is not known but it was opposite the church of Sant&#x27;Atanasio dei Greci.

=== Return to France (1641–42) ===

As the work of Poussin became well known in Rome, he received invitations to return to Paris for important royal commissions, proposed by Sublet de Noyers, the Superintendent of buildings for Louis XIII. When Poussin declined, Noyers sent his cousins, Roland Fréart de Chambray and Paul Fréart, to Rome to persuade Poussin to come home, offering him the title of First Painter to the King, plus a substantial residence at the Tuileries Palace. Poussin yielded, and in December 1640 he was back in Paris.

The correspondence of Poussin to Cassiano dal Pozzo and his other friends in Rome show that he was appreciative of the money and honors, but he was quickly overwhelmed by a large number of commissions, particularly since he had taken the habit of working slowly and carefully. His new projects included &quot;The Institution of the Eucharist&quot; for the chapel of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and &quot;The Miracle of Saint Francis-Xavier&quot; for the altar of the church of the novitiate of the Jesuits. In addition, he was asked to the ceilings and vaults for the Grand gallery of the Louvre, and to paint a large allegorical work for the study of Cardinal Richelieu, on the theme &quot;Time Defending Truth from the Attacks of Envy and Discord&quot;, with the figure of &quot;Truth&quot; clearly standing for Cardinal Richelieu. He was also expected to provide designs for royal tapestries and the front pieces for books from the royal printing house. He was also subjected to considerable criticism from the partisans of other French painters, including his old friend Simon Vouet. He completed a painting of the &quot;Last Supper&quot; (now in the Louvre), eight cartoons for the Gobelins tapestry manufactory, drawings for a proposed series of grisaille paintings of the &quot;Labors of Hercules&quot; for the Louvre, and a painting of the &quot;Triumph of Truth&quot; for Cardinal Richelieu (now in the Louvre). He was increasingly unhappy with the court intrigues and the overwhelming number of commissions. In the autumn of 1642, when the King and court were out of Paris in Languedoc, he found a pretext to leave Paris and to return permanently to Rome.

=== Final years in Rome (1642–1665) ===

When he returned to Rome in 1642, he found the art world was in transition. Pope Urban VIII died in 1644, and the new Pope, Innocent X, was less interested in art patronage, and preferred Spanish over French culture. Poussin&#x27;s great patrons, the Barberinis, departed Rome for France. He still had a few important patrons in Rome, including Cassiano dal Pozzo and the future Cardinal Camillo Massimi, but began to paint more frequently for the patrons he had found in Paris. Cardinal Richelieu died in 1642, and Louis XIII died in 1643, and Poussin&#x27;s Paris sponsor, Sublet de Noyer, lost his position, but Richelieu&#x27;s successor, Cardinal Mazarin, began to collect Poussin&#x27;s works. In October 1643, Poussin sold the furnishings of his house in the Tuileries in Paris, and settled for the rest of his life in Rome.

In 1647, André Félibien, the secretary of the French Embassy in Rome, became a friend and painting student of Poussin, and published the first book devoted entirely to his work. His growing number of French patrons included the Abbé Louis Fouquet, brother of Nicolas Fouquet, the celebrated superintendent of finances of the young Louis XIV. In 1655 Fouquet obtained for Poussin official recognition of his earlier title as First Painter of the King, along with payment for his past French commissions. To thank Fouquet, Poussin made designs for the baths Fouquet was constructing at his château at Vaux-le-Vicomte.

Another important French patron of Poussin in this period was Paul Fréart de Chantelou, who came to Rome in 1643 and stayed there for several months. He commissioned from Poussin some of his most important works, including the second series of the &quot;Seven Sacraments&quot;, painted between 1644 and 1648, and his &quot;Landscape with Diogenes&quot;. In 1649 he painted the &quot;Vision of St Paul&quot; for the comic poet Paul Scarron, and in 1651 the &quot;Holy Family&quot; for the duc de Créquy. Landscapes had been a secondary feature of his early work; in his later work nature and the landscape was frequently the central element of the painting.

He lived an austere and comfortable life, working slowly and apparently without assistants. The painter Charles Le Brun joined him in Rome for three years, and Poussin&#x27;s work had a major influence on Le Brun&#x27;s style. In 1647, his patrons Chantelou and Pointel requested portraits of Poussin. He responded by making two self-portraits, completed together in 1649.

He suffered from declining health after 1650, and was troubled by a worsening tremor in his hand, evidence of which is apparent in his late drawings. Nonetheless, in his final eight years he painted some of the most ambitious and celebrated of his works, including &quot;The Birth of Bacchus&quot;, &quot;Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun&quot;, &quot;Landscape with Hercules and Cacus&quot;, the four paintings of &quot;The Seasons&quot; and &quot;Apollo in love with Daphné&quot;.

His wife Anne-Marie died in 1664, and thereafter his own health sank rapidly. On 21 September he dictated his will, and he died in Rome on 19 November 1665 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina.

==Subjects==

Each of Poussin&#x27;s paintings told a story. Though he had little formal education, Poussin became very knowledgeable in the nuances of religious history, mythology and classical literature, and, usually after consulting with his clients, took his subjects from these topics. Many of his paintings combined several different incidents, occurring at different times, into the same painting, in order to tell the story, and the &quot;affetti&quot;, or facial expressions of the participants, showed their different reactions. Aside from his self-portraits, Poussin never painted contemporary subjects.

===Religion===

Religion was the most common subject of his paintings, as the church was the most important art patron in Rome and because there was a growing demand by wealthy patrons for devotional paintings at home. He took a large part of his themes from the Old Testament, which offered more variety and the stories were often more vague and gave him more freedom to invent. He painted different versions of the stories of Eliazer and Rebecca from the Book of Genesis and made three versions of &quot;Moses saved from the waters&quot;. The New Testament provided the subject of one of his most dramatic paintings, &quot;The Massacre of the Innocents&quot;, where the general slaughter was reduced to a single brutal incident. In his &quot;Judgement of Solomon&quot; (1649), the story can be read in the varied facial expressions of the participants.

His religious paintings were sometimes criticized by his rivals for their variation from tradition. His painting of Christ in the sky in his painting of Saint Francis-Xavier was criticized by partisans of Simon Vouet for having &quot;Too much pride, and resembling the god Jupiter more than a God of Mercy&quot;. Poussin responded that &quot;he could not and should not imagine a Christ, no matter what he is doing, looking like a gentle father, considering that, when he was on earth among men, it was difficult to look him in the face&quot;.

The most famous of his religious works were the two series called &quot;The Seven Sacraments&quot;, representing the meaning of the moral laws behind each of the principal ceremonies of the church, illustrated by incidents in the life of Christ. The first series was painted in Rome by his major early patron, Cassiano dal Pozzo, and was finished in 1642. It was viewed by his later patron, Paul Fréart de Chantelou, who asked for a copy. Instead of making copies, Poussin painted an entirely new series of paintings, which was finished by 1647. The new series had less of the freshness and originality of the first series, but was striking for its simplicity and austerity in achieving its effects; the second series illustrated his mastery of the balance of the figures, the variety of expressions, and the juxtaposition of colors.

===Mythology and classical literature===

Classical Greek and Roman mythology, history and literature provided the subjects for many of his paintings, particularly during his early years in Rome. His first successful painting in Rome, &quot;The Death of Germanicus&quot;, was based upon a story in the &quot;Annals&quot; of Tacitus. In his early years he devoted a series of paintings, full of color, movement and sensuality, to the Bacchanals, colorful portrayals of ceremonies devoted to the god of wine Bacchus, and celebrating the goddesses Venus and Flore. He also created &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (1635), telling the story of the Roman goddess through an elaborate composition full of dynamic figures for the French patron, Cardinal Richelieu, who had also commissioned the Bacchanals. Many of his mythological paintings featured gardens and floral themes; his first Roman patrons, the Barberini family, had one of largest and most famous gardens in Rome. Another of his early major themes was the Rape of the Sabine Women, recounting how the King of Rome, Romulus, wanting wives for his soldiers, invited the members of the neighboring Sabine tribe for a festival, and then, on his signal, kidnapped all of the women. He painted two versions, one in 1634, now in the Metropolitan Museum, and the other in 1637, now in the Louvre. He also painted two versions illustrating a story of Ovid in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; in which Venus mourning the death of Adonis after a hunting accident, transforms his blood into the color of the anemone flower.

Throughout his career, Poussin frequently achieved what the art historian Willibald Sauerländer terms a &quot;consonance ... between the pagan and the Christian world&quot;. An example is &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (1660–64), in which Christian and pagan themes are mingled: &quot;Spring&quot;, traditionally personified by the Roman goddess Flora, instead features Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden; &quot;Summer&quot; is symbolized not by Ceres but by the biblical Ruth.

In his later years, his mythological paintings became more somber, and often introduced the symbols of mortality and death. The last painting he was working on before his death was &quot;Apollo in love with Daphne&quot;, which he presented to his patron, the future Cardinal Massimi, in 1665. The figures on the left of the canvas, around Apollo, largely represented vitality and life, while those on the right, around Daphne, were symbols of sterility and death. He was unable to complete the painting because of the trembling of his hand, and the figures on the right are unfinished.

===Poetry and allegory===

Besides classical literature and myth, he drew often from works of the romantic and heroic literature of his own time, usually subjects decided in advance with his patrons. He painted scenes from the epic poem &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; by Torquato Tasso (1544–1595), published in 1581, and one of the most popular books in Poussin&#x27;s lifetime. His painting &quot;Renaud and Armide&quot; illustrated the death of the Christian knight Renaud at the hands of the magician Armide; who, when she saw his face, saw her hatred turn to love. Another poem by Tasso with a similar theme inspired &quot;Tancred and Hermiene&quot;; a woman finds a wounded knight on the road, breaks down in tears, then finds the strength through love to heal him.

Allegories of death are common in Poussin&#x27;s work. One of the best-known examples is &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot;, a subject he painted in about 1630 and again in the late 1630s. Idealized shepherds examine a tomb inscribed with the title phrase, &quot;Even in Arcadia I exist&quot;, reminding that death was ever-present.

A fertile source for Poussin was Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi, who wrote moralistic theatrical pieces which were staged at the Palace Barberini, his early patron. One of his most famous works, &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, was inspired by another Rospigliosi piece. According to his early biographers Bellori and Felibien, the four figures in the dance represent the stages of life: Poverty leads to Work, Work to Riches, and Riches to Luxury; then, following Christian doctrine, luxury leads back to poverty, and the cycle begins again. The three women and one man who dance represent the different stages and are distinguished by their different clothing and headdresses, ranging from plain to jeweled. In the sky over the dancing figures, the chariot of Apollo passes, accompanied by the Goddess Aurora and the Hours, a symbol of passing time.

===Landscapes and townscapes===

Poussin is an important figure in the development of landscape painting. In his early paintings the landscape usually forms a graceful background for a group of figures, but later the landscape played a larger and larger role and dominated the figures, illustrating stories, usually tragic, taken from the Bible, mythology, ancient history or literature. His landscapes were very carefully composed, with the vertical trees and classical columns carefully balanced by the horizontal bodies of water and flat building stones, all organized to lead the eye to the often tiny figures. The foliage in his trees and bushes is very carefully painted, often showing every leaf. His skies played a particularly important part, from the blue skies and gray clouds with bright sunlit borders (a sight often called in France &quot;a Poussin sky&quot;) to illustrate scenes of tranquility and the serenity of faith, such as the &quot;Landscape with Saint John on Patmos&quot;, painted in the late 1630s before his departure for Paris; or extremely dark, turbulent and threatening, as a setting for tragic events, as in his &quot;Landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; (1651). Many of his landscapes have enigmatic elements noticeable only with closer inspection; for example, in the center of the landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe, despite the storm in the sky, the surface of the lake is perfectly calm, reflecting the trees.

Between 1650 and 1655, Poussin also painted a series of paintings now often called &quot;townscapes&quot;, where classical architecture replaces trees and mountains in the background. The painting &quot;The Death of Saphire&quot; uses this setting to illustrate two stories simultaneously; in the foreground, the wife of a wealthy merchant dies after being chastised by St. Peter for not giving more money to the poor; while in the background another man, more generous, gives alms to a beggar.

==Style and method==
Throughout his life Poussin stood apart from the popular tendency toward the decorative in French art of his time. In Poussin&#x27;s works a survival of the impulses of the Renaissance is coupled with conscious reference to the art of classical antiquity as the standard of excellence. Rejecting the emotionalism of Baroque artists such as Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, he emphasized the cerebral. His goal was clarity of expression achieved by &quot;disegno&quot; or &#x27;nobility of design&#x27; in preference to &quot;colore&quot; or color.

During the late 1620s and 1630s, he experimented and formulated his own style. He studied the Antique as well as works such as Titian&#x27;s Bacchanals (&quot;The Bacchanal of the Andrians&quot;, &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot;, and &quot;The Worship of Venus&quot;) at the Casino Ludovisi and the paintings of Domenichino and Guido Reni.

In contrast to the warm and atmospheric style of his early paintings, Poussin by the 1630s developed a cooler palette, a drier touch, and a more stage-like presentation of figures dispersed within a well defined space. In &quot;The Triumph of David&quot; (–34; Dulwich Picture Gallery), the figures enacting the scene are arranged in rows that, like the architectural facade that serves as the background, are parallel to the picture plane. The violence of &quot;The Rape of the Sabine Women&quot; (; Louvre) has the same abstract, choreographed quality seen in &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot; (1639–40).

Contrary to the standard studio practice of his time, Poussin did not make detailed figure drawings as preparation for painting, and he seems not to have used assistants in the execution of his paintings. He produced few drawings as independent works, aside from the series of drawings illustrating Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; he made early in his career. His drawings, typically in pen and ink wash, include landscapes drawn from nature to be used as references for painting, and composition studies in which he blocked in his figures and their settings. To aid him in formulating his compositions he made miniature wax figures and arranged them in a box that was open on one side like a theatre stage, to serve as models for his composition sketches. Pierre Rosenberg described Poussin as &quot;not a brilliant, elegant, or seductive draughtsman. Far from it. His lack of virtuosity is, however, compensated for by uncompromising rigour: there is never an irrelevant mark or a superfluous line.&quot;

==Legacy==
In the years following Poussin&#x27;s death, his style had a strong influence on French art, thanks in particular to Charles Le Brun, who had studied briefly with Poussin in Rome, and who, like Poussin, became a court painter for the King and later the head of the French Academy in Rome. Poussin&#x27;s work had an important influence on the 17th-century paintings of Jacques Stella and Sébastien Bourdon, the Italian painter Pier Francesco Mola, and the Dutch painter Gerard de Lairesse.
A debate emerged in the art world between the advocates of Poussin&#x27;s style, who said the drawing was the most important element of a painting, and the advocates of Rubens, who placed color above the drawing. During the French Revolution, Poussin&#x27;s style was championed by Jacques-Louis David in part because the leaders of the Revolution looked to replace the frivolity of French court art with Republican severity and civic-mindedness. The influence of Poussin was evident in paintings such as &quot;Brutus&quot; and &quot;Death of Marat&quot;. Benjamin West, an American painter of the 18th century who worked in Britain, found inspiration for his canvas of &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; in Poussin&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Germanicus&quot;.

The 19th century brought a resurgence of enthusiasm for Poussin. French writers were seeking to create a national art movement and Poussin became one of their heroes: the founding father of the French School; he appears in plays, stories and novels as well as physiognomic studies. He also became the model for the myth of the child genius, who becomes the miserable artist rejected by society, as can be seen in Francois-Marius Granet&#x27;s painting of the death of Poussin. One of his greatest admirers was Ingres, who studied in Rome and became Director of the French Academy there. Ingres wrote, &quot;Only great painters of history can paint a beautiful landscape. He (Poussin) was the first, and only, to capture the nature of Italy. By the character and taste of his compositions, he proved that such nature belonged to him; so much so that when facing a beautiful site, one says, and says correctly, that it is &quot;Poussinesque&quot;. Another 19th-century admirer of Poussin was Ingres&#x27; great rival, Eugène Delacroix; he wrote in 1853: &quot;The life of Poussin is reflected in his works; it is in perfect harmony with the beauty and nobility of his inventions...Poussin was one of the greatest innovators found in the history of painting. He arrived in the middle of the school of mannerism, where the craft was preferred to the intellectual role of art. He broke with all of that falseness&quot;.

Cézanne appreciated Poussin&#x27;s version of classicism. &quot;Imagine how Poussin entirely redid nature, that is the classicism that I mean. What I don&#x27;t accept is the classicism that limits you. I want that a visit to a master will help me find myself. Every time I leave a Poussin, I know better who I am.&quot; Cézanne was described in 1907 by Maurice Denis as &quot;the Poussin of Impressionism&quot;. Georges Seurat was another Post-Impressionist artist who admired the formal qualities of Poussin&#x27;s work.

In the 20th century, some art critics suggested that the analytic Cubist experiments of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were also founded upon Poussin&#x27;s example. In 1963 Picasso based a series of paintings on Poussin&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Sabine Women&quot;. André Derain, Jean Hélion, Balthus, and Jean Hugo were other modern artists who acknowledged the influence of Poussin. Markus Lüpertz made a series of paintings in 1989–90 based on Poussin&#x27;s works.

The finest collection of Poussin&#x27;s paintings today is at the Louvre in Paris. Other significant collections are in the National Gallery in London; the National Gallery of Scotland; the Dulwich Picture Gallery; the Musée Condé, Chantilly; the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; and the Museo del Prado, Madrid.

<text>Jacint Rigau-Ros i Serra (; 18 July 1659 – 29 December 1743), known in French as Hyacinthe Rigaud (), was a Catalan-French baroque painter most famous for his portraits of Louis XIV and other members of the French nobility.

==Biography==

Rigaud was born in Perpignan, then part of the Crown of Aragon, a few months before Spain ceded the city to France under the Treaty of the Pyrenees (7 November 1659). His family, the &quot;Rigau&quot;, were Catalan; he was the son of a tailor, the grandson of painter-gilders from Roussillon, and the elder brother of another painter (Gaspard).

Rigaud was baptised with his Catalan name in the old Cathédrale Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Perpignan on 20 July 1659, two days after his birth at rue de la Porte-d&#x27;Assaut. His baptismal name was &quot;Jyacintho Rigau or Jacint Rigau i Ros&quot; This is sometimes transliterated as &quot;Híacint Francesc Honrat Mathias Pere Martyr Andreu Joan Rigau&quot; After the Roussillon and the Cerdanya were ceded to France the following 7 November owing to the Treaty of the Pyrenees, the Rigau remained in Roussillon, and became French subjects.

He was trained in tailoring in his father&#x27;s workshop, but perfected his skills as a painter under Antoine Ranc at Montpellier from 1671 onwards, before moving to Lyon four years later. It was in these cities that he became familiar with Flemish, Dutch and Italian painting, particularly that of Rubens, Van Dyck, Rembrandt and Titian, whose works he later collected. Arriving in Paris in 1681, he won the prestigious scholarship known as the prix de Rome in 1682, but on the advice of Charles Le Brun did not make the trip to Rome which was included in the scholarship. Rigaud was received into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1710, and he rose to the top of this institution before retiring from it in 1735.
Since Rigaud&#x27;s paintings captured very exact likenesses along with the subject&#x27;s costumes and background details, his paintings are considered precise records of contemporary fashions. 
==Family==
Hyacinthe&#x27;s father, Josep Matias Pere Ramon Rigau, was a tailor (&quot;sastre&quot; in Catalan) in the parish of Saint-Jean de Perpignan, &quot;as well as a painter&quot;, descended from a line of well-established artists in the Perpignanian basin who had been commissioned to decorate several tabernacles and other panels for liturgical use. Few of these have survived to the present (Palau-del-Vidre, Perpignan, Montalba-d&#x27;Amélie, Joch...). Hyacinthe&#x27;s grandfather, Jacinto &quot;major&quot;, and even more Jacinto&#x27;s father, Honorat &quot;minor&quot;, were heads of the family and the local art world from 1570 to 1630; probably as much as gilders as painters, since in their studios were to be found &quot;many prints and books treating on the art of painting, and other things, such as brushes and palettes for painting&quot;.

Working for the collège Saint-Éloi in his city since 1560, and acting as representative of its guild of painters and gilders, on 22 November 1630 Jacinto &quot;major&quot; and other gilders and colleagues participated in the development of the statutes and minutes of the city&#x27;s collège Saint-Luc
. Honorat &quot;minor&quot; is generally identified as the painter of &quot;The Canonisation of Saint Hyacinthe&quot;, formerly in Perpignan&#x27;s Dominican convent and now at Joch, the tabernacle of the church of Palau-del-Vidre (28 March 1609) and the retable at Montalba near Amélie-les-Bains. The father of Honorat &quot;minor&quot; is generally identified as the painter of the retable of Saint-Ferréol (1623) in the église Saint-Jacques de Perpignan and formerly in the couvent des Minimes, whilst Honorat &quot;major&quot; is usually identified as the painter of the paintings of the retable of the église Saint-Jean-l&#x27;Évangéliste at Peyrestortes.

On 13 March 1647, Hyacinthe&#x27;s father Matias &quot;Rigau&quot;, married Thérèse Faget (1634–1655), daughter of a carpenter. Widowed shortly after, he decided to speedily remarry, to Maria Serra, daughter of a Perpignan textile merchant (&quot;pentiner&quot; in Catalan), on 20 December 1655. In 1665, he acquired a house &quot;en lo carrer de las casas cremades&quot; (now rue de l&#x27;Incendie, near the cathedral) and received the income from a parcel of vineyards in the Bompas territory. By his second marriage, he also acquired a house on place de l&#x27;Huile, but he soon sold it.

===Journey to Lyon===

Little is known about Rigaud&#x27;s activities in Lyon, due to the lack of surviving documents. However, as per tradition, artists from Montpellier had strong ties with this city, as had, for example, Samuel Boissière who was trained in there, in Lyon. The identity of Rigaud&#x27;s future depicted models shows that he worked for the city&#x27;s cloth merchants, whose flourishing trade had long since given the city its profitable income.

Even if they had only been registered from 1681 onwards, the date when he moved to Paris, his &quot;youthful&quot; portraits were probably , like those of Antoine Domergue, the king&#x27;s councillor and provincial governor of Lyon, in 1686, and &quot;Mr Sarazin de Lion&quot;, of a famous dynasty of bankers of Swiss origins, in 1685. Rigaud&#x27;s portrait of Jean de Brunenc, painted in 1687, a silk merchant, banker and consul of Lyon, assembles all the ingredients for which the painter was later successful.

In her thesis on the engravers from the Drevet family, Gilberte Levallois-Clavel revealed certain aspects of the private relations between Rigaud and Pierre Drevet; their friendship came about at the beginning of the 1700s, after the painter produced a portrait of the engraver, in which he depicted himself as well.

In 1681, when Hyacinthe Rigaud decided to move to Paris, inspired by Drevet who was also attracted to the capital, he had already established a good reputation amongst the local clientele, from Switzerland to Aix-en-Provence.

Going back to the artist&#x27;s biography, Dezallier d&#x27;Argenville states that one of Rigaud&#x27;s main reasons for his 1695 voyage was to paint his mother&#x27;s portrait: &quot;He painted her from many angles, and had her marble bust made by the notable Coysevox, which was his cabinet&#x27;s ornament for the rest of his life&quot;. In his first will, dated 30 May 1707, the artist left the bust to the Grand Dauphin, Louis XIV&#x27;s son, though the sculpture would then be left to the Academy which explains its presence in the Louvre. Also in the document, Rigaud bequeathed the portrait containing the two profiles of Maria Serra to the elder son of his brother Gaspard, named Hyacinthe.

In reality, Rigaud painted a second painting, bearing the three stances presented to Coysevox: an oval painting kept in a private collection, copied by Géricault, in Dijon, and the subject of one of Drevet&#x27;s engravings. He also applied sketches of his sister Claire, accompanied by her husband and their first daughter, to the canvas.

The year 1695 also saw the production of two versions of &quot;Christ expiant sur la Croix&quot;, with a distinct Flemish influence, proof of Rigaud&#x27;s rare incursion into the domain of historical depictions or the &quot;great genre&quot;. He bequeathed his mother the first version which would then, at her death, be left to the Grands Augustins convent in Perpignan, and gave the second, in 1722, to the Dominican convent of his city of birth.

In spring 1696, Hyacinthe Rigaud returned to Paris, where he painted one of his most important portraits of the year. This was in fact solicited by the duke of Saint-Simon, to depict Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé, an abbot, using a skillful subterfuge that remains notable in the history of painting.

In 1709, he was made a noble by his hometown of Perpignan. In 1727, he was made a knight of the Order of Saint Michael.

Following the death of &quot;directeur&quot; Louis de Boullogne on 28 November 1733, Rigaud proposed that the four rectors of the Académie, Nicolas de Largillière, Claude-Guy Hallé, Guillaume Coustou, and himself, rotate the post. This oligarchy would persist until the election of Coustou as sole director on 5 February 1735.

Rigaud died in Paris on 29 December 1743 at the age of 84.

==Clientele==
 He was one of the most important portrait painters during the reign of King Louis XIV. His instinct for impressive poses and grand presentations precisely suited the tastes of the royal personages, ambassadors, clerics, courtiers, and financiers who sat for him. Rigaud owes his celebrity to the faithful support he received from the four generations of Bourbons whose portraits he painted; namely King Louis XIV, next his son Louis, Grand Dauphin, then the King&#x27;s grandson (the Grand Dauphin&#x27;s son) Louis, Duke of Burgundy (also called the Petit Dauphin), and finally the Grand Dauphin&#x27;s grandson (the Petit Dauphin&#x27;s son), who became the next king—Louis XV, who succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV in 1715. He garnered the core of his clientele among the richest circles as well as among the bourgeois, financiers, nobles, industrialists and government ministers, also courting all the major ambassadors of his time and several European monarchs. His œuvre reads as a near-complete portrait gallery of the chief movers in France from 1680 to 1740. Some of that œuvre (albeit a minority) also includes those of more humble origins – Rigaud&#x27;s friends, fellow artists or simple businessmen.

Rigaud is inseparable from his best-known work, a 1701 painting of Louis XIV in his coronation costume which today hangs in the Louvre in Paris, as well as the second copy also requested by Louis XIV that now hangs at the Palace of Versailles.
He is renowned for his portrait paintings of Louis XIV, the royalty and nobility of Europe, and members of their courts and considered one of the most notable French portraitists of the classical period. For Jacques Thuillier, professor at the Collège de France: 
According to the French art historian Louis Hourticq, 
True &quot;photographs&quot;, faces that Diderot called &quot;letters of recommendation written in the common language of all men&quot;, Rigaud&#x27;s works today populate the world&#x27;s major museums.

==Legacy==

Rigaud&#x27;s works today populate the world&#x27;s major museums. The exact number of paintings he produced remains in dispute, since he left a highly detailed catalogue but also more than a thousand different models which specialists agree he used. To these may be added the large number of copies in Rigaud&#x27;s , without even mentioning the hundreds of other paintings rediscovered since the accounts&#x27; publication in 1919. Rigaud painted many important figures in the world of art such as the sculptors Desjardins (to whom, as an old friend, he delivered three successive portraits), Girardon and Coysevox; the painters Joseph Parrocel, La Fosse and Mignard; the architects De Cotte, Hardouin-Mansart and Gabriel. He also painted portraits of poets such as La Fontaine or Boileau, as well as religious figures such as the cardinal de Fleury and Bossuet; many influential archbishops and bishops paid large sums of money for a portrait.

The , a museum dedicated to Rigaud&#x27;s artwork, opened in Perpignan in 1833. The museum has since expanded to include works by Aristide Maillol, Raoul Dufy, and other artists. It received over 65,000 visitors in 2017 following its renovation and a temporary exhibition dedicated to Picasso.

<text>Pierre Francis de Marigny Berton, CC, O.Ont. (July 12, 1920 – November 30, 2004) was a Canadian historian, writer, journalist and broadcaster. Berton wrote 50 best-selling books, mainly about Canadiana, Canadian history and popular culture. He also wrote critiques of mainstream religion, anthologies, children&#x27;s books and historical works for youth. He was a reporter and war correspondent, an editor at &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; and, for 39 years, a guest on Front Page Challenge. He was a founder of the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada, and won many honours and awards.

==Early years==
Berton was born on July 12, 1920, in Whitehorse, Yukon, where his father had moved for the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush. His family moved to Dawson City, Yukon in 1921. His mother, Laura Beatrice Berton (maiden name Laura Beatrice Thompson), was a schoolteacher in Toronto until she was offered a job as a teacher in Dawson City at the age of 29 in 1907. She met Frank Berton in the nearby mining town of Granville shortly after settling in Dawson and teaching kindergarten. Laura Beatrice Berton&#x27;s autobiography of life in the Yukon entitled &quot;I Married the Klondike&quot; was published in her later years and gave her what her son Pierre describes as &quot;a modicum of fame, which she thoroughly enjoyed.&quot; At the time, Dawson City was a highly remote place. After visiting Dawson City in the summer of 1939 to see some old friends, it took Berton a week to go from Dawson City to Whitehorse as the only means of a transport was an old paddle-wheeler named the &quot;Casca&quot; that moved slowly down the Yukon river. Growing up in Dawson City, which had briefly during the Klondike gold rush of the 1890s been one of Canada&#x27;s largest cities, left Berton with an eye for the colourful. During his childhood he encountered numerous eccentric people who had gone north during the gold rush and ended up staying in Dawson City after the gold rush ended.
Berton&#x27;s family moved to Victoria, British Columbia in 1932. At age 12, he joined the Scout Movement. Berton later wrote that &quot;The Scout Movement was the making of me&quot;. He credited Scouting with keeping him from becoming a juvenile delinquent. He started his journalism career in scouting and later wrote that &quot;the first newspaper I was ever associated with was a weekly typewritten publication issued by the Seagull Patrol of St. Mary’s Troop.&quot; He remained in scouting for seven years and wrote about his experiences in an article titled &quot;My Love Affair with the Scout Movement&quot;. Like his father, Pierre Berton worked in Klondike mining camps during his years as a history major at the University of British Columbia, where he also worked on the student paper &quot;The Ubyssey&quot;.

==War-time career==
He spent his early newspaper career in Vancouver, where at 21 he was the youngest city editor on any Canadian daily, at the Vancouver News-Herald, replacing editorial staff that had been called up to serve in the Second World War. On 7 December 1941, the Japanese Navy bombed the American naval base at Pearl Harbor while on the same day, the Japanese Army invaded the British colonies of Hong Kong and Malaya. The extent and rapidity of the Japanese victories in the winter of 1941-1942 came as a considerable surprise, and Berton stated that from his vantage in Vancouver that the war felt much closer than it had done before. In February 1942, he noted Japanese-Canadians being held in Vancouver&#x27;s Hastings Park prior to being sent to internment camps in the interior of the province. Meanwhile all over Greater Vancouver the businesses and homes of Japanese-Canadians were seized by the federal government, which proceeded to promptly auction off most of the assets it seized.

Berton himself was conscripted into the Canadian Army under the National Resources Mobilization Act in 1942 and attended basic training in British Columbia, nominally as a reinforcement soldier intended for The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Under the National Resources Mobilization Act, the government had the power to impose conscription for the defence of Canada and only volunteers were sent to fight overseas until late 1944. The men who were conscripted and chose to remain in Canada were popularly known as &quot;the Zombies&quot;, a term that was highly disparaging. Because the &quot;Zombies&quot; refused to fight overseas, in many quarters they were viewed as cowards. He elected to &quot;go Active&quot; (the euphemism for volunteering for overseas service). By 1942, the Axis powers were winning the war, and Berton came to feel that the two very different visions of the world offered up by the respective sides were such that he had to take a stand by &quot;going active&quot;, instead of remaining safely in Canada as a &quot;Zombie&quot;. His aptitude as a soldier was such that he was appointed Lance Corporal and attended NCO school, and became a basic training instructor in the rank of corporal. Due to a background in university Canadian Officers&#x27; Training Corps (COTC) and inspired by other citizen-soldiers who had been commissioned, he sought training as an officer.

Berton spent the next several years attending a variety of military courses, becoming, in his words, the most highly trained officer in the military. He was warned for overseas duty many times, and was granted embarkation leave many times, each time finding his overseas draft being cancelled. A coveted trainee slot with the Canadian Intelligence Corps saw Berton, now a Captain, trained to act as an Intelligence Officer (IO), and after a stint as an instructor at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, he finally went overseas in March 1945. In the UK, he was told that he would have to requalify as an IO because the syllabus in the UK was different from that in the intelligence school in Canada. By the time Berton had requalified, the war in Europe had ended. During his time in Britain, he dated a woman named Frances who informed him on V Day that she was pregnant with his child and did not want him involved, as told by Berton in his autobiography and retold in his Biography. Berton never knew his British child. He volunteered for the Canadian Army Pacific Force (CAPF), granted a final &quot;embarkation leave&quot;, and found himself no closer to combat employment by the time the Japanese surrendered in September 1945.

==Fame as a journalist==
In 1947 he went on an expedition to the Nahanni River with pilot Russ Baker. Berton&#x27;s account for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; was picked up by International News Service, making him a noted adventure-travel writer. On 1 February 1948, an article by Berton appeared in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; under the title &quot;They&#x27;re Only Japs&quot;, which was the first account of the internment of Japanese Canadians to appear in the Canadian media that provided interviews with some of the interned people. Most notably, Berton interviewed Marie Suzuki, a second-generation Japanese Canadian school-teacher whose career had been ruined by the internment. Berton was quite critical of the decision made by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to order the internment on 24 February 1942 that saw all Japanese Canadians interned, regardless if they were immigrants or Canadian-born, unlike the case-by-case policy with interning German Canadians and the partial internment of Italian Canadians that saw all Italian immigrants interned. Berton&#x27;s article was also the first to note that greed was a major factor behind the demand for the internment as many of the people in British Columbia who agitated for total internment of all Japanese Canadians were very interested in seizing their assets for themselves.

==War correspondent in Korea==
In 1951, Berton covered the Korean War as the war correspondent of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. To make up for not seeing action in World War Two, Berton was highly keen to work as a war correspondent and lobbied Ralph Allen, the editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, to go to Korea as soon as the Korean War started in 1950. In late 1950 Berton wrote profiles in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; of the two commanding officers of the all-volunteer Canadian Special Brigade, namely Brigadier John Meredith Rockingham and Colonel Jacques Dextraze, which were highly flattering to the subjects of his profiles and led the Canadian Army to expect that Berton would take a pro-war line in his reportage. In February 1951, Berton&#x27;s profile of Rockingham was published in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; under the title &quot;Rocky&quot; noted that Rockingham was a highly decorated Second World War veteran who had won the Distinguished Service Order at Dieppe in 1942 who was much liked and respected by the men who served under him. The arrival of Canadian Special Brigade at the front in February 1951 finally provided the occasion for him to work as a war correspondent. Berton arrived in South Korea in March 1951 at a critical moment as the Chinese had just taken Seoul and were preparing for a spring offensive that was launched in April 1951 that was aimed at winning the war by driving out United Nations forces of Korea. The Chinese Spring Offensive was launched, which saw the Anglo-Canadian-Australian-New Zealander 27th Infantry Commonwealth Brigade in the thick of the fighting. After the failure of the Chinese spring offensive, the United Nations launched a counter-offensive that saw Seoul retaken. By June 1951, the war had reached a stalemate and negotiations were opened for an armistice, which took two years to conclude with the armistice finally being signed on 27 July 1953.

During the stalemate phase of the war, both sides sought limited advantages to improve their bargaining positions in the armistice talks by capturing hills, which improved the tactical situation while having no impact on the wider strategical situation in Korea. Berton in his reportage noted that the Canadian soldiers were frustrated by the &quot;war of the hills&quot;, complaining that it seemed pointless to them to be used essentially as pawns to improve the bargaining positions in the armistice talks by fighting to capture or hold some barren hill in Korea. Berton reported that the average Canadian soldier in Korea hated their Chinese enemies, but had a grudging respect for their fighting abilities while holding their South Korean allies in complete and utter contempt as the South Koreans always broke under Chinese assaults. Berton also noted, but was prevented by censorship from saying that though the Canadian soldiers respected the British, Australians and New Zealand soldiers they served alongside, but held a lower opinion of the U.S. Army. The majority of American soldiers in Korea were teenage draftees, who generally came from the more poorer and less educated elements of American society, which led to morale problems. Berton&#x27;s experiences in Korea left him with a dislike for the U.S. Army, whose mostly white and middle-class officers he charged were callous in their treatment of their own soldiers, especially if they were black or Hispanic. Berton was to later to write in the 1990s that all of the problems that the U.S. Army had experienced during the Vietnam war such as morale issues, racial tensions, drug use, and a wide gap between officers and the other ranks he had seen first-hand in Korea, led to his conclusion that the U.S. Army had failed to learn anything from the Korean war.

Though most of the Canadians in Korea routinely referred to the Koreans as &quot;gooks&quot;, Berton&#x27;s articles often mentioned the suffering of Korean civilians such as one profile he did of a Mrs. Sook whose son was shot by the North Koreans in 1950 when he refused to join the North Korean People&#x27;s Army, leaving her broken and destitute. In another article entitled &quot;Seoul, the saddest city in the world&quot; Berton described the war devastated city of Seoul as being in ruins with the people living there reduced to begging to stay alive and that the deeply corrupt South Korean government of President Syngman Rhee had no interest in helping its own people. Berton complied with the requests of the military censors during his time in Korea, altering one story about the killing of 60 black American soldiers in a Chinese raid that began with the line &quot;Killed in their sleeping bags with their boots on&quot; to instead say that the 60 American soldiers were heroically killed in battle resisting the Chinese raid. Berton came to deeply dislike the censorship that he was faced during the Korean war, complaining that he was writing reports that were full of lies and half-truths. Despite agreeing to the requests of the censors, Berton&#x27;s reports focusing on the bleakness and savagery of the Korean War led to accusations that he was anti-war, and hence pro-Communist. Berton was later to write that though he had much respect for the Canadian veterans of Korea, he felt that Canada&#x27;s involvement in the Korean war was a major mistake.

==Editor in Toronto==
Berton moved to Toronto in 1947. At the age of 31 he was named managing editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. In the 1950s, he published a series of articles in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; that was later turned into his 1956 book &quot;The Mysterious North&quot;, which recounted his experiences in the far north of Canada in a highly romanticized way. The book had only modest sales, but it led to Berton being perceived within the Canadian media as an expert on the far north, causing him to appear on television as the resident northern expert. In 1957, he became a key member of the CBC&#x27;s public affairs flagship program, Close-Up, and a permanent panelist on the popular television show &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot;. That same year, he also narrated the Academy Award-nominated National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;City of Gold&quot;, exploring life in his hometown of Dawson City during the Klondike Gold Rush. He then released an album in conjunction with Folkways Records, entitled &quot;The Story of the Klondike: Stampede for Gold – The Golden Trail.&quot;

In 1958, he published his best-selling book &quot;Klondike The Last Great Gold Rush&quot;, a social history about the Klondike gold rush. Berton traced the appalling hardships faced by the thousands of people who came from around the world to seek their fortunes in the Klondike, the vast majority of whom failed to achieve their dreams of riches. Berton also covered the rise and fall of Dawson City, a boomtown that was full of bars, brothels and gambling halls that catered to the gold prospectors, giving it a disreputable reputation both at the time and since. The book&#x27;s hero was the tough and stern Colonel Sam Steele, the Yukon commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, a policeman with an almost legendary reputation who upheld law and order during the gold rush. Berton&#x27;s background as someone who grew up in the Yukon added to the book&#x27;s appeal as many reviewers praised &quot;Klondike The Last Great Gold Rush&quot; for its sense of &quot;authenticity&quot;.

Berton joined the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; as associate editor of the &quot;Star Weekly&quot; and columnist for the daily paper in 1958. In April 1959, Berton went to Cairo with a camera crew from the &quot;Close-Up&quot; television show with the aim of interviewing President Gamal Abdel Nasser who turned out to be unwilling to be interviewed. To relieve the boredom as he waited for an entire month to interview Nasser, Berton had the &quot;Close-Up&quot; camera crew make a documentary about life in Egypt, which he credited with broadening his perspective. Following the Sharpeville massacre of 21 March 1960, when the South African police opened fire on a crowd of black South Africans protesting apartheid, killing 69 people while wounding about 180 people, Berton was one of the speakers at a fundraiser at Massey Hall that sought to raise money to treat those wounded in the massacre. Greatly shaken by the massacre, Berton used his column to criticize the apartheid system in South Africa, writing: &quot;The time has come for this country to finally take a stand on South Africa&quot;. At the time, there was a split within the Commonwealth (considered more important at the time than today) between its predominately white members such as Britain, Australia, and New Zealand who wanted South Africa to stay vs. nonwhite members such as India, Pakistan, Ghana, and Malaya who were pressing to have South Africa expelled while Canada initially equivocated about where it stood. At the time, there were concerns that the question of South African membership might cause the break-up of the Commonwealth. Berton argued that Canada should side with the nonwhite bloc and use its influence to have South Africa expelled from the Commonwealth and not be permitted to return until apartheid ended.

In 1960, he performed an experiment, which demonstrated widespread anti-Semitism in the resort industry when he first mailed out a letter under the name Sol Cohen to 106 resorts in the Ontario countryside, asking to stay for two weeks, and the next day he mailed another set of letters to the same resorts under the name D.M. Douglas, again asking to stay for two weeks. The majority of the letters sent out under the name Cohen received the reply that the resorts were all booked up and there was no space or alternatively did not answer at all. By contrast, the majority of the letters sent out under the name Douglas all received the replies that he could stay for the requested two weeks. Berton compared the replies he received, noting there was a frosty tone to the replies to the Cohen letters while there was more warmth in the replies to the Douglas letters. Only the Green Gables lodge in Muskoka had been willing to allow Berton under the name Cohen to stay. In his column, Berton named all of the resorts that they were willing to rent to someone with the typically Scottish surname of Douglas while refusing to rent to someone with the typically Jewish surname of Cohen. The column provoked much discussion at the time, and led to demands to end the anti-Semitic policies of the resort owners.

In 1960, he visited Japan as part of his duties as a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; columnist to investigate Japan 15 years after the end of World War Two, where he was stunned by Japanese economic miracle as he noted all of the Japanese cities had been rebuilt after having bombed to utter ruin during the war. Berton visited Hiroshima and its Peace Memorial, where he found himself sickened by the photographs of the survivors of the atomic bombing of that city, writing that: &quot;for sheer horror it outdoes everything save the relics of Belsen and Buchenwald...I seemed to feel the little eyes of the Japanese boring into my back as I stared at those terrible pictures of heaped and peeling human bodies...The Germans, we are told, were stunned by motion pictures of the extermination camps. No sensitive Westerner can escape the same sense of guilt in the museum of Hiroshima. We roasted people to death over a slow fire. We tortured them just as surely as the Nazis tortured the Jews&quot;. The comparison of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima to the Holocaust provoked controversy. Berton expressed much sadness in his columns about the fading of traditional Japanese culture as he noted the most popular form of plastic surgery for Japanese women was making their eyes appear Western; that Western music was being played everywhere including Shinto shrines; and the &quot;this typical Japanese family [that he had stayed with] was about typical as John David Eaton&#x27;s would be in Toronto&quot;. By the early 1960s, Berton&#x27;s company, Pierre Berton Enterprises, was making an annual income of $37, 000 dollars at a time when the typical Canadian had an annual income of $5, 187 dollars, making him and his family comfortably upper middle-class.

As a columnist, he turned the beating of the gambler Maxie Bluestein by the gangster Johnny Papalia on 21 March 1961 who used a steel pipe to nearly beat Bluestein to death in public into a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;. Berton called the beating of Bluestein a &quot;semi-execution&quot; brazenly committed in the front lobby of the popular Town Tavern nightclub of Toronto, and demanded that the police bring Papalia to justice despite the unwillingness of nearly 100 witnesses to testify. Berton described the beating: &quot;...as terrible a beating as it is possible to give a man without killing him...Iron bars with ropes attached to them for greater leverage rained down on Bluestein&#x27;s head and across his forehead, eyes and cheekbones. His scalp was split seven or eight times. Knuckledusters were smashed into his eyes and a broken bottle was ground into his mouth. When Bluestein dropped to the floor, he was kicked in the face. His overcoat, torn and slashed, was literally drenched in his own blood... When I saw Bluestein, some 10 days after the affair, he looked like a piece of meat&quot;. Papalia finally turned himself in as the case was attracting too much media attention for the comfort of his underworld associates.

In 1961, Berton wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Secret World Of Og&quot; based on the whimsical stories he told his daughters in the 1950s. Berton&#x27;s publisher, Jack McClelland, was skeptical about the sales potential of &quot;The Secret World of Og&quot;, which he reluctantly published in the fall of 1961, apparently as a favor to Berton. The book turned out be very popular, selling out its first print run of 8,284 copies by the summer of 1962, and by the 1980s &quot;The Secret World of Og&quot; had sold 70,000 copies worldwide, making it into one of Berton&#x27;s most successful books. Berton always answered the fan mail he received from children who liked &quot;The Secret World of Og&quot; right up to his death, which was the only fan mail that he consistently answered.

==Public intellectual==
Berton left the &quot;Star&quot; in 1962 to commence &quot;The Pierre Berton Show&quot;, which ran until 1973. In January 1963, Berton started to work as a &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; columnist, where the other writers such as Robert Fulford and Peter Gzowski wanted to have him fired because the often frivolous and trivial nature of his columns were felt to be embarrassing. In May 1963, Berton was fired from &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; for a column he wrote entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Stop Hoaxing the Kids About Sex&quot;, where he wrote that he would not object if his teenage daughters engaged in premarital sex, saying he hoped that they had enough wisdom to use a comfortable bed instead of a dingy backseat of a car. The column, which was intended as a criticism of sexualized advertising as Berton contended that teenage sex was the logical consequence of sexualized marketing, provoked national outrage and led to calls for a boycott of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; if Berton continued to write. Berton always felt that being fired was unjustified, especially because the editors of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; had wanted him to write provocative columns about contemporary issues to boost circulation.

In 1963, Berton received death threats when an episode about the &quot;Front de libération du Québec&quot; (FLQ) aired on &quot;The Pierre Berton Show&quot;. The show featured an interview with Sergeant Walter &quot;Rocky&quot; Leja of the Canadian Army, who had been badly injured when he attempted to dismantle a bomb planted by the FLQ in Montreal. The same episode featured an interview with Pierre Trudeau, at the time a law professor at the Université de Montréal. In his interview with Berton, Trudeau stated that Quebec had received a &quot;raw deal&quot; from the rest of Canada, but went on to denounce Quebec separatism. Trudeau stated that the FLQ&#x27;s claims that Quebec&#x27;s situation was analogous to Algeria under French rule (with the FLQ playing the same role as the FLN) was nonsense; he said that French-Canadians like himself had nothing remotely like the status of Algerian Muslims under French rule. Trudeau stated that if Quebec became independent, it would be a &quot;banana republic&quot;. Berton&#x27;s interview with Trudeau is credited with first introducing him to an English-Canadian audience. Berton was able to persuade famous people to appear on his television show; in September 1964, during a visit to London, Berton interviewed the philosopher Bertrand Russell, the actress Vivien Leigh, the singer Noël Coward and the actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr.

In November 1964, Berton devoted an episode of his show to the youth culture of Britain, which had attracted worldwide attention following the success of the Beatles. In the episode, Berton unknowingly scored a scoop when he interviewed Mick Jagger and the other members of the newly formed Rolling Stones. When Berton asked Jagger about the charge that he was a bad influence on young people, he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel morally responsible for anyone&quot;. The episode was credited with helping to popularize hairstyles and clothing associated with the mods and rockers, the two major sub-cultures within British culture at the time. In 1964, an episode of &quot;The Pierre Berton Show&quot; attracted national controversy when Berton examined the subject of homosexuality, which was illegal in Canada at the time. Berton interviewed several American homosexuals (no Canadian gays were willing to appear on the show) about their lifestyles, but the CBC would not air the episode again after receiving a flood of complaints. Like many journalists, Berton was interested in the &quot;Banks affair&quot;, concerning an American gangster, Hal C. Banks, who, with the support of the Canadian government, had been allowed to take over the Communist-dominated Seafarers International Union in 1949. The way that Banks had operated as a sort of state-sanctioned criminal who had been allowed to engage in many acts of violence was immensely controversial. In an episode aired on 22 November 1964, Berton pressed Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson about the Banks affair, leading Pearson to admit that Banks had been a major campaign donor to the Liberal Party in the 1950s, which Pearson had denied up until that time. Starting in December 1964, Berton started to broadcast a Christmas special on his TV show from his home in Kleinburg, covering his family&#x27;s celebration of Christmas.

In 1965, Berton published a best-selling book, &quot;The Comfortable Pew&quot;, which was quite critical of the Anglican Church, whose teachings Berton condemned as sanctimonious, conformist, submissive to power, and hypocritical with respect to sexuality and other social issues. Within weeks of its publication, the book&#x27;s first print run of 100,000 copies sold out, making Berton about $25,000. At the time, the Church of England was one of the leading social institutions in English-Canadian society, and the book produced a storm of controversy as Berton urged church leaders to accept birth control, premarital sex and homosexuality. Berton called for the Anglican Church to accept what he called &quot;real Christian love, in all its flexibility, with all of its concern for real people rather than for any fixed set of principles&quot;.

The controversy caused by &quot;The Comfortable Pew&quot; made Berton an ubiquitous figure in Canadian media, leading the columnist Denis Braithwaite to complain in &quot;The Globe &amp; Mail&quot; that Canadians were now living in the &quot;Berton era&quot;. Braithwaite wrote: &quot;Virtually every media outlet is preoccupied with Pierre Berton and his new book. We get Berton in the morning and Berton at night. He is in the book section, the religion section, the TV section of our daily newspapers; he is the subject of feature articles and gossipy items in the national magazines; he is interviewed by every disc jockey, advice to the housewife dispenser, numerologist and pitchmen on every radio station in the land; he is on every television program, on every Canadian television channel, not just once in a while or two or three times a day, but all day, everyday-or so it seems. Our children lisp his name, our teenagers take his advice on sex; our wives curtsey to his image&quot;.

In the 1960s, Berton was a leading member of the Sordsmen&#x27;s Club , a group of Toronto intellectuals and businessmen who met for expensive lunches with women who were not their wives, and who were forbidden to attend its meetings unless their husband was not present. Other members included Jack McCllelland, John C. Parkin, Harold Town, George Fryer, Chuck Rathgreb, Arthur Hailey, and Ralph McCreath. Women who attended the lunches included the columnist Nancy Philips; the journalist Adrienne Clarkson; the singer Dinah Carroll; the journalist Barbara Moon; Joan Taylor, the wife of a sports journalist; the broadcaster Joan McCormack; and the art gallery owner Dorothy Cameron. About the club, Philips said in 1986: &quot;We had an idea that we shouldn&#x27;t go home alone, let&#x27;s put it that way&quot;. A later controversy developed when it emerged that at end of the lunches, which typically occurred on a Friday afternoon and lasted five hours, each man stood behind a woman of his choosing with whom he expected to have sex.

In 1968, Berton became concerned that his books dealing with contemporary issues would become dated and forgotten with the passage of time. He noted that &quot;Klondike&quot;, his account of the Klondike gold rush of the 1890s, had a more timeless quality since it covered a subject that would not become dated, and indeed was the subject of enduring popular fascination. At the same time, he noted that with the notable exceptions of Donald Creighton and W. L. Morton, Canada had no story-teller historians who wrote popular and accessible narratives of Canadian history. For reasons of pride and Canadian nationalism, Berton set out to become a story-teller historian who would write books for a mass audience. For his first book, his subject was the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the 19th century, which he intended as a national epic. Berton wanted to give the struggle to build the CPR a role analogous to that of the Revolutionary War in American memory, as the founding national epic. In this regard, Berton acknowledged the importance of Confederation in 1867, but argued that Canada did not truly become a nation until the CPR was completed in 1885. Berton defined the building of the railroad as a struggle of man against nature, seeing it as a triumph of human ingenuity and willpower, as the builders defeated the harsh landscape of northern Ontario, the seemingly endless Prairies, and the imposing Rocky Mountains. In the spring of 1968, Berton began his research for his railroad saga, which became &quot;The National Dream&quot; and &quot;The Last Spike&quot;. Before the 1960s, the major divisions in English-Canadian society were between continentalism (i.e., moving Canada closer to the United States), associated with the Liberal Party, and imperialism (which in a Canadian context meant closer ties with Great Britain), associated with the Conservative party. The 1960s saw the emergence of the &quot;new nationalism&quot; that rejected both continentalism and imperialism as options. Berton became one of the principle spokesmen for this new nationalism, as he argued that Canada could stand alone as a great nation.

&quot;The Pierre Berton Show&quot; was a popular television show owing to famous guests from Canada and around the world. In the 1968–1969 season, Berton interviewed from the United States the burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee, the actress Sharon Tate, the pornographer Bob Guccione, the &quot;playmate novelist&quot; Alice Denham, the actor Charlton Heston, and Rachel Jones (an airline stewardess who was presented at the time as one of the co-authors of the bestselling 1967 pseudo-memoir &quot;Coffee, Tea or Me?&quot; detailing her supposed erotic history). That season, Canadian guests included the singer Neil Young, Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau, the journalist Laurier LaPierre, the columnist Peter C. Newman and the feminist activist June Callwood. In early 1969, Berton&#x27;s show aired a five-part series called &quot;The Indian Revolution&quot;, about the emerging Red Power movement. One of the episodes, &quot;The Rape of the Languages&quot;, featured an early expose of the residential schools. Berton interviewed several First Nations people in support of his thesis that indigenous peoples had been &quot;beaten, starved, and otherwise punished by church and federal schools&quot;. The choice of guests and themes that season reflected what had become the show&#x27;s main focus, namely a mixture of &quot;celebrities, sex, and social justice&quot;. In July 1969, Berton had the telephone removed from his house in Kleinburg, and claimed he was leaving for Mexico. He spent the summer of 1969 writing his railroad epic, which came to be divided into two volumes owing to its length with his work finally being finished in December 1969.

In 1971 Berton interviewed Bruce Lee, the famous martial artist&#x27;s only surviving television interview. Berton&#x27;s television career included spots as host and writer on &quot;My Country&quot;, &quot;The Great Debate&quot;, &quot;Heritage Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; and &quot;The National Dream&quot;. From 1966 to 1984, Berton and long-time collaborator Charles Templeton made the daily syndicated radio debate show &quot;Dialogue&quot;, based first at CFRB and later at CKEY.

Berton came to be Canada&#x27;s best-known intellectual. His biographer, Brian McKillop wrote: &quot;No one in Canada or for that matter in North America, managed to take hold of the full range of the mainstream media with the same kind of commanding presence and authority. One searches in vain for an American or British equivalent. It is if he somehow carried the DNA of Edward R. Murrow and Jack Paar, Vance Packard and Michael Harrington, Bernard DeVoto and Studs Terkel, with more than a little Garrison Keillor in the mix. Each of these figures—a war correspondent who spoke truth to power; a host of the most watched and enduring television interview program of its era; a muckraking journalist in the age of the consumer; a left-wing critic of North American society; a popular and respected historian of nation and empire in North America; a collector of the kind of folklore that serves as the first draft of history; a folksy, story-telling humorist of nostalgic bent—was or is a man of exceptional accomplishment in his own area. The magnitude of Berton&#x27;s achievement was that he spanned them all and become more than their sum&quot;.

==Historian==
In 1970, book one of Berton&#x27;s epic about the building of the CPR, &quot;The National Dream&quot; was published, becoming a great critical and commercial success by 1971. Book two of the series, &quot;The Last Spike&quot;, was published in 1971 and was even more successful with the public. The success of &quot;The Last Spike&quot; transformed Berton into a sort of &quot;national institution&quot; as he become the popular story-teller historian that he set out to be. Such was the popularity of &quot;The Last Spike&quot; that in 1972 that stores sold mementoes related to the book, which was most unusual for a history book. In a review, the American historian Ralph Hidy wrote that Berton&#x27;s railroad saga was an &quot;essentially sound&quot; history that was relatively free of errors. Hidy stated that though Berton broke no new ground in his railroad saga, his work was very &quot;lively&quot; and carried &quot;the reader through one cliff-hanging situation after another&quot;. The sections dealing with the building of the Rocky mountains section of the CPR are generally considered to be the vivid and exciting part of Berton&#x27;s railroad epic. Berton described how the railroad builders had to quite literally blast and hack their way through the sheer granite of the Rocky mountains, which was an extremely difficult, dangerous and arduous task, given the technology of the time. Hidy wrote that as a work of narrative popular history, Berton succeeded admirably in telling the story of the construction of the CPR over daunting odds, and in impressing the reader as to why the building of the CPR, which was completed five years ahead of schedule, was considered one of the great engineering feats of the 19th century. However, other historians were more critical. Michael Bliss felt that Berton&#x27;s picture of the Prime Minister, Sir John A. MacDonald, was too colored by hero-worship as Bliss in a critical review stated that Berton went beyond even Creighton (whose two-volume biography of MacDonald was very sympathetic towards its subject) in portraying MacDonald as the heroic prime minister.

In common with many other Canadians, Berton found the 1970s to be an unpleasant decade as the recession caused by the Arab oil shock of 1973–74 put an end to the &quot;long summer&quot; of prosperity that had begun in 1945 while the election of the separatist PQ government in Quebec in 1976 led to doubts about whatever Canada would even last as a nation. By 1979, on the threshold of a new decade that seemed to promise only more trouble, Berton came to feel that Canada needed another national epic to give hope in dark and uncertain times. As the subject of his new national epic, Berton chose the War of 1812 with the first of his books, &quot;The Invasion of Canada&quot; dealing with the subject being published in 1980, and the second one, &quot;Flames Across the Border&quot; in 1981. Berton chose to interpret the War of 1812 as not a war between the United States and Great Britain which just happened to be fought in North America, but rather as the beginning of a Canadian national identity. Though Berton&#x27;s nationalist interpretation of the War of 1812 was not accepted by most historians it certainly appealed to the Canadian public and his books dealing with the War of 1812 sold very well.

In his 1984 book &quot;The Promised Land&quot;, he covered the settlement of the Prairie provinces in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Pierre set out to debunk the heroic image of the colonization of the West by focusing on the hardships and suffering of the farmers who could be easily ruined by crop failures. He focused instead on the tenacity and sheer determination of the settlers and provided a new heroic image of the settlement of the West. In 1986, he published &quot;Vimy&quot;, which was one of his more successful books dealing with the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917. Berton provoked much controversy that his thesis that Vimy may have been a great victory that saw all the four divisions of the Canadian corps fight together for the first time to achieve what had been considered an impossible task, namely to take the heavily fortified Vimy ridge that towered about the Douai plain, but the victory were not worth the sacrifices of thousands of young men who were either killed or wounded. Berton noted that 1 out of 10 Canadians who stormed up the heights of Vimy Ridge on 9 April 1917 were either killed or wounded, leading him to the conclusion that it would be better if the battle had not been fought at all.

==1990s-2000s==
In 1992, he published &quot;Niagara: A History&quot;, a social history dealing with the people associated with the Niagara Falls together with a follow-up picture book of Niagara falls in 1993. Unlike his other books, the Niagara books sold poorly, which marked the beginning of his decline from his position as Canada&#x27;s preeminent public intellectual. The decline of the appeal of his books was linked to the decline of the &quot;new nationalism&quot; he had been associated with. Berton almost seemed to acknowledge the decline of the &quot;new nationalism&quot; in his 1997 book &quot;1967 The Last Good Year&quot;, arguing that the Centennial year of 1967 was the highpoint of Canadian history and everything that had happened since 1967 had been a story of decline and decay. In a review of &quot;Onward to War&quot; in the &quot;Globe &amp; Mail&quot; in October 2001, the historian Modris Eksteins wrote: &quot;&#x27;Canada&#x27;s historian&#x27;, as his publishers are describing him in recent advertising, takes us with his usual narrative verve across sundry battlefields, of South Africa, northern Europe and Korea, but also Ottawa and other venues of our domestic political strife...is this kind of judgmental narrative what history should be in the 21st century? If the world changed in the last century as dramatically as Berton insists, can - or should - history be written in much the same way Carlyle and Macaulay presented it over a century ago? ...That vision of the past as an interconnected whole has shattered over the century about which Berton writes, as if hit by a mammoth artillery shell, but there&#x27;s no sign of this in his account.

==Honours==
Berton served as the chancellor of Yukon College and, along with numerous honorary degrees, received over 30 literary awards such as the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Creative Non-Fiction (three times), the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, and the Gabrielle Léger Award for Lifetime Achievement in Heritage Conservation in 1989. He is a member of Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, having been inducted in 1998. In The Greatest Canadian project, he was voted No. 31 in the list of great Canadians. Berton was named Toronto Humanist of the Year 2003 by the Humanist Association of Toronto. The honour is presented by H.A.T. to men and women who, in their actions and creative endeavours, exemplify the principles of Humanism: a commitment to reason, compassion, ethics and human dignity. In 1992, he was named a member of the Order of Ontario. In 1974, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada; in 1986, he was named a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada&#x27;s highest decoration.

==Retirement==
In 2004, Berton published his 50th book, &quot;Prisoners of the North&quot;, after which he announced in an interview with CanWest News Service that he was retiring from writing. On October 17, 2004, the CA$12.6-million Pierre Berton Resource Library, named in his honour, was opened in Vaughan, Ontario.

He had lived in nearby Kleinburg, Ontario, for about 50 years.

Berton attracted attention in October 2004 by discussing his 40 years of recreational use of marijuana on two CBC Television programs, &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;. On the latter show he gave a &quot;celebrity tip&quot; on how to roll a joint.

==Personal life==
Berton married Janet Walker in 1946. They had eight children. Berton was an atheist.

==Death==
Berton died at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, of heart failure, at the age of 84 on November 30, 2004. His cremated remains were scattered at his home in Kleinburg. He was survived by his wife and their eight children, along with 14 grandchildren.

==Legacy==
Established in 1994, the Pierre Berton Award is presented annually by Canada&#x27;s National History Society for distinguished achievement in presenting Canadian history in an informative and engaging manner. Berton was the first recipient and agreed to lend his name to future awards.

His childhood home in Dawson City, Yukon, now called Berton House, is currently used as a retreat for professional Canadian writers. Established authors apply for a three-month-long subsidized residency, adding to the area&#x27;s literary community with events such as local public readings. Previously, the Berton House Writers&#x27; Retreat was administered by the Berton House Writers&#x27; Retreat Society and Elsa Franklin, Pierre Berton&#x27;s long-time editor and agent. In October 2007, the deed to Berton House was passed to the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada; the literary organization now oversees the program as part of its roster of literary support.

A school in Vaughan, Ontario, was named for Pierre Berton in the York Region District School Board in September 2011. The Berton family visited and had an official opening of the school in front of the students.

<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 (; NATO reporting name: Fresco) is a high-subsonic fighter aircraft produced in the Soviet Union from 1952 and was operated by air forces internationally. The MiG-17 was license-built in China as the Shenyang J-5 and Poland as the PZL-Mielec Lim-6. The MiG-17 is still being used by the North Korean air force in the present day and has seen combat in the Middle East and Asia.

The MiG-17 was an advanced modification of the MiG-15 aircraft produced by the Soviet Union during the Korean War. Production of the MiG-17 was too late for use in that conflict and was first used in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958. While the MiG-17 was designed to shoot down slower American bombers, it showed surprising success when used by North Vietnamese pilots to combat American fighters and fighter-bombers during the Vietnam War, nearly a decade after its initial design. This was due to the MiG-17 being more agile and maneuverable than the American F-4 Phantom and F-105 Thunderchief, which were focused on speed and long range combat, as well as the fact that MiG-17 was armed with guns, which initial models of the F-4 Phantom lacked.

==Design and development==
While the MiG-15bis introduced swept wings to air combat over Korea, the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau had already begun work on its replacement in 1949 (originally the MiG-15bis45) in order to fix any problems found with the MiG-15 in combat. The result was one of the most successful transonic fighters introduced before the advent of true supersonic types such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 and North American F-100 Super Sabre. The design would ultimately still prove effective into the 1960s when pressed into subsonic dogfights over Vietnam against much faster planes that were not optimized for maneuvering in such slower speed, short-range engagements.

While the MiG-15 used a Mach sensor to deploy airbrakes because it could not safely exceed Mach 0.92, the MiG-17 was designed to be controllable at higher Mach numbers. Early versions that retained the original Soviet copy of the Rolls-Royce Nene engine, the Klimov VK-1, were heavier with equal thrust. Later MiG-17s would be the first Soviet fighter application of an afterburner, which burned extra fuel in the exhaust of the basic engine to give extra thrust at a high efficiency cost.

Though the MiG-17 looks very similar to the MiG-15, it had a new thinner and more highly swept wing and tailplane for speeds approaching Mach 1. While the F-86 introduced the &quot;all-flying&quot; tailplane, which made the aircraft more controllable near the speed of sound, this feature would not be adopted on MiG aircraft until the fully supersonic MiG-19. The wing sweep was 45° (like the U.S. F-100 Super Sabre) near the fuselage and 42° for the outboard part of the wing. The stiffer wing resisted the tendency to bend its wingtips and lose aerodynamic symmetry unexpectedly at high speeds and wing loads.

Other easily visible differences to its predecessor were the addition of a third wing fence on each wing, the addition of a ventral fin and a longer and less tapered rear fuselage that added about one meter in length. The MiG-17 shared the same Klimov VK-1 engine, and much of the rest of its construction such as the forward fuselage, landing gear and gun installation was carried over. The first prototype, designated I-330 &quot;SI&quot; by the construction bureau, was flown on 14 January 1950, piloted by Ivan Ivashchenko.

In the midst of testing, pilot Ivan Ivashchenko was killed when his aircraft developed flutter, which tore off his horizontal tail, causing a spin and crash on 17 March 1950. Lack of wing stiffness also resulted in aileron reversal which was discovered and fixed. Construction and tests of additional prototypes &quot;SI-2&quot; and experimental series aircraft &quot;SI-02&quot; and &quot;SI-01&quot; in 1951, were generally successful. On 1 September 1951, the aircraft was accepted for production, and formally given its own MiG-17 designation after so many changes from the original MiG-15. It was estimated that with the same engine as the MiG-15&#x27;s, the MiG-17&#x27;s maximum speed is higher by 40–50 km/h, and the fighter has greater maneuverability at high altitude.

Serial production started in August 1951, but large quantity production was delayed in favor of producing more MiG-15s so it was never introduced in the Korean War. It did not enter service until October 1952, when the MiG-19 was almost ready to be flight tested. During production, the aircraft was improved and modified several times. The basic MiG-17 was a general-purpose day fighter, armed with three cannons, one Nudelman N-37 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm with 80 rounds per gun, 160 rounds total. It could also act as a fighter-bomber, but its bombload was considered light relative to other aircraft of the time, and it usually carried additional fuel tanks instead of bombs.

Although a canopy that provided clear vision to the rear—necessary for air-to-air combat (dogfighting), like the F-86—was designed, production MiG-17Fs got a cheaper rear-view periscope, which would still appear on Soviet fighters as late as the MiG-23. By 1953, pilots got safer ejection seats with protective face curtains and leg restraints like the Martin-Baker seats in the West. The MiG-15 had suffered for its lack of a radar gunsight, but in 1951, Soviet engineers obtained a captured F-86 Sabre from Korea, and copied the optical gunsight and SRD-3 gun ranging radar to produce the ASP-4N gunsight and SRC-3 radar. The combination would prove deadly over the skies of Vietnam against aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom, whose pilots lamented that guns and radar gunsights had been omitted as obsolescent.

The second prototype variant, &quot;SP-2&quot; (dubbed &quot;Fresco A&quot; by NATO), was an interceptor equipped with a radar. Soon a number of MiG-17P (&quot;Fresco B&quot;) all-weather fighters were produced with the RP-1 Izumrud radar and front air intake modifications.

In early 1953 the MiG-17F day fighter entered production. The &quot;F&quot; indicated it was fitted with the VK-1F engine with an afterburner by modifying the rear fuselage with a new convergent-divergent nozzle and fuel system. Early VK-1F engines that were specifically modified to equip the MIG-17F had issues during prolonged normal afterburner usage, due to the insufficient heat resistance of the alloys used for the external nozzle body and stator vanes. Because of this, early 1953-1955 production planes had a special afterburner unit that used a separate tank filled with 90% ethanol for consumption in the afterburner due to its lower combustion temperature. This engine variant was labeled VK-1F(A). Later production jets used a normal system with on-board fuel. The afterburner doubled the rate of climb and greatly improved vertical maneuvers. But while the plane was not designed to be supersonic, skilled pilots could just dash to supersonic speed in a shallow dive, although the aircraft would often pitch up just short of Mach 1. This became the most popular variant of the MiG-17. The next mass-produced variant, MiG-17PF (&quot;Fresco D&quot;) incorporated a more powerful Izumrud RP-2 radar, though they were still dependent on Ground Control Interception to find and be directed to targets. In 1956 a small series (47 aircraft) was converted to the MiG-17PM standard (also known as PFU) with four first-generation Kaliningrad K-5 (NATO reporting name AA-1 &#x27;Alkali&#x27;) air-to-air missiles. A small series of MiG-17R reconnaissance aircraft were built with VK-1F engine (after first being tested with the VK-5F engine).

5,467 MiG-17, 1,685 MiG-17F, 225 MiG-17P and 668 MiG-17PF were built in the USSR by 1958. Over 2,600 were built under licence in Poland and China.

===License production===


In 1955, Poland received a license for MiG-17 production. The MiG-17F was produced by the WSK-Mielec factory under the designation Lim-5 (an abbreviation of &quot;licencyjny myśliwiec&quot; – license-built fighter). The first Lim-5 was built on 28 November 1956 and 477 were built by 1960. Apart from Poland, a number were exported to Bulgaria, designated as MiG-17F. An unknown number were built as the Lim-5R reconnaissance variant, fitted with the AFA-39 camera. In 1959–1960, 129 MiG-17PF interceptors were produced as the Lim-5P. WSK-Mielec also developed several Polish strike variants based on the MiG-17: the Lim-5M, produced from 1960; Lim-6bis, produced from 1963 (totaling 170 aircraft). Additionally some Lim-5Ps were converted in the 1970s into attack Lim-6Ms whereas other Lim-5, Lim-6bis and Lim-5P aircraft were modified for reconnaissance role as the Lim-6R, Lim-6bis R and Lim-6MR.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), an initial MiG-17F was assembled from parts in 1956, with license production following in 1957 at Shenyang. The Chinese-built version is known as the Shenyang J-5 (for local use) or F-5 (for export). Similarly the MiG-17PF was manufactured there as the J-5A (F-5A for export). Altogether 767 of these single-seater variants were built.

==Operational history==
MiG-17s were designed to intercept straight-and-level-flying enemy bombers, not for dogfighting with other fighters. This subsonic (Mach .93) fighter was effective against slower (Mach .6-.8), heavily loaded U.S. fighter-bombers, as well as the mainstay American strategic bombers during the MiG-17&#x27;s development cycle (such as the Boeing B-50 Superfortress or Convair B-36 Peacemaker, which were both still powered by piston engines). It was not however able to intercept the new generation of British jet bombers such as the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, which could both fly higher. The USAF&#x27;s introduction of strategic bombers capable of supersonic dash speeds such as the Convair B-58 Hustler and General Dynamics FB-111 rendered the MiG-17 obsolete in front-line PVO service, and they were supplanted by supersonic interceptors such as the MiG-21 and MiG-23.

MiG-17s were not available for the Korean War, but saw combat for the first time over the Straits of Taiwan when the Communist PRC MiG-17s clashed with the Republic of China (ROC, Nationalist China) F-86 Sabres in 1958.

MiG-17s downed a spy aircraft in the 1958 C-130 shootdown incident over Armenia, with 17 casualties.

===Vietnam War===
In 1960, the first group of approximately 50 North Vietnamese airmen were transferred to the PRC to begin transitional training onto the MiG-17. By this time the first detachment of Chinese trained MiG-15 pilots had returned to North Vietnam, and a group of 31 airmen were deployed to the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) base at Son Dong for conversion to the MiG-17. By 1962 the first North Vietnamese pilots had finished their MiG-17 courses in the Soviet Union and the PRC, and returned to their units; to mark the occasion, the Soviets sent as a &quot;gift&quot; 36 MiG-17 fighters and MiG-15UTI trainers to Hanoi in February 1964. These airmen would create North Vietnam&#x27;s first jet fighter regiment, the 921st. By 1965, another group of MiG pilots had returned from training in Krasnodar, in the USSR, as well as from the PRC. This group would form North Vietnam&#x27;s second fighter unit, the 923rd Fighter Regiment. While the newly created 923rd FR operated only MiG-17s, and initially these were the only types available to oppose modern American supersonic jets before MiG-21s and MiG-19s were introduced into North Vietnamese service (the 925 FR regiment was formed in 1969, flying MiG-19s).

American fighter-bombers had been in theatre flying combat sorties since 1961, and the U.S. had many experienced pilots from the Korean War and World War II, such as World War II veteran Robin Olds. Untried MiGs and pilots of the VPAF would be pitted against some of the most combat experienced airmen of the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and U.S. Navy. On 3 April 1965 six MiGs took off from Noi Bai Air Base in two groups of two and four respectively, with the first acting as bait and the second being the shooters. Their target were U.S. Navy aircraft supporting an USAF 80-aircraft strike package trying to knock out the Thanh Hóa Bridge. The MiG-17 leader, Lt. Pham Ngoc Lan, attacked a group of Vought F-8 Crusaders of VF-211 from and damaged an F-8E flown by Lt. Cdr. Spence Thomas, who managed to land the aircraft at Da Nang Air Base. A second F-8 was claimed by his wingman Phan Van Tuc, but this is not corroborated by USN loss listings.

On 4 April 1965, the USAF made another attempt on the Thanh Hóa Bridge with 48 Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) loaded with 384 x bombs. The Thunderchiefs were escorted by a MIGCAP flight of F-100 Super Sabres from the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron (416th TFS). Coming from above, four MiG-17s from the 921st Fighter Regiment bypassed the escorts and dove onto the Thunderchiefs, shooting two of them down; the leader Tran Hanh downed F-105D BuNo. &quot;59-1754&quot; of Major F. E. Benett, and his element leader Le Minh Huan downed F-105D BuNo. &quot;59-1764&quot; of Captain J. A. Magnusson. The Super Sabres engaged; one AIM-9 Sidewinder was fired and missed (or malfunctioned), and another F-100D flown by Captain Donald Kilgus fired 20 mm cannons, scoring a probable kill. Tran Hanh&#x27;s wingman Pham Giay went down and was killed. No other U.S. airmen reported any confirmed aerial kills during the air battle; Tran Hanh stated that three of his accompanying MiG-17s had been shot down by the opposing USAF fighters.

Three F-100s from the MiGCAP, piloted by LtCol Emmett L. Hays, Capt Keith B. Connolly, and Capt Donald W. Kilgus, all from the 416th TFS, had engaged the MiG-17s. The four attacking MiGs from the 921st FR were flown by Flight Leader Tran Hanh, Wingman Pham Giay, Le Minh Huan and Tran Nguyen Nam. Flight Leader Tran Hanh was the only Vietnamese survivor from the air battle and believed that the others in his flight were &quot;... shot down by the F-105s.&quot; Based upon the report, the USAF F-100s could have been mistaken for F-105s, and the loss of three MiG-17s was attributed to Super Sabres, the first aerial victories of any American aircraft in the war. The F-100s themselves would never again encounter MiGs, being relegated to close air support. They were replaced in the MiGCAP role by faster and longer range but less manoeuvrable McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms.

USAF Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell was &quot;hopping mad&quot; to hear that two Mach-2-class F-105s had been shot down by Korean War-era subsonic North Vietnamese MiG-17s.

In 1965, the NVAF had only 36 MiG-17s and a similar number of qualified pilots, which increased to 180 MiGs and 72 pilots by 1968. The Americans had at least 200 USAF F-4s and 140 USAF F-105s, plus at least 100 U.S. Navy aircraft (F-8s, A-4s and F-4s) which operated from the aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin, plus scores of other support aircraft. The Americans had a multiple numerical advantage.

The MiG-17 was the primary interceptor of the fledgling VPAF in 1965, responsible for their first aerial victories and seeing extensive service during the Vietnam War. Some North Vietnamese pilots preferred the MiG-17 over the MiG-21 because it was more agile, though not as fast; three of the 16 VPAF Aces of the war (credited with shooting down five or more opposing aircraft) were from MiG-17s. Those were: Nguyen Van Bay (seven victories), Luu Huy Chao and Le Hai (both with six). The rest gained ace status in MiG-21s.

===MiG-17/J-5 aerial combat victories in the Vietnam War 1965–1972===
This table lists VPAF and Chinese air-to-air kills. Sources include Hobson p. 271 and Toperczer (#25) pp. 88–90.

VPAF flew their interceptors with guidance from ground controllers, who directed the MiGs to ambush American formations. The MIGs made fast attacks against US formations from several directions (usually the MiG-17s performed head-on attacks and the MiG-21s attacked from the rear). After shooting down a few American planes and forcing some of the F-105s to drop their bombs prematurely, the MiGs did not wait for retaliation, but disengaged rapidly. This &quot;guerrilla warfare in the air&quot; proved very successful.

The MiG-17 was not originally designed to function as a fighter-bomber, but in 1971 Hanoi directed that United States Navy warships were to be attacked by elements of the VPAF. This would require the MiG-17 to be fitted with bomb mountings and release mechanisms. Chief Engineer of the VPAF ground crews, Truong Khanh Chau, was tasked with the mission of modifying two MiG-17s for the ground attack role; after three months of work, the two jets were ready. On 19 April 1972, two pilots from the 923rd FR took their bomb laden MiG-17s and attacked the U.S. Navy destroyer and light cruiser . Each MiG was armed with two bombs. Pilot Le Xuan Di managed to hit the destroyer&#x27;s aft 5&quot; (127 mm) gun mount, destroying it, but inflicting no fatalities, as the crewmen had vacated the turret earlier due to a malfunction with the gun system.

From 1965 to 1972, MiG-17s from the VPAF 921st and 923rd FRs would claim 71 aerial victories against U.S. aircraft: 11 Crusaders, 16 F-105 Thunderchiefs, 32 F-4 Phantom IIs, two A-4 Skyhawks, seven A-1 Skyraiders, one C-47 cargo/transport aircraft, one Sikorsky CH-3C helicopter and one Ryan Firebee UAV., while VPAF lost 63 MiG-17s in air combat According to Russian sources, from 1965 to 1972, MiG-17s from the VPAF shot-down 143 enemy aircraft and helicopters, while VPAF lost 75 MiG-17s through all causes and 49 pilots were killed

The American fighter community was shocked in 1965 when elderly, subsonic MiG-17s downed sophisticated Mach-2-class F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers over North Vietnam. As a result of these experiences the U.S. Air Force initiated project &quot;Feather Duster&quot; aimed at developing tactics that would enable the heavier American fighters to deal with smaller and more agile opponents like the MiG-17. To simulate the MiG-17 the U.S. Air Force chose the F-86H Sabre. One pilot who participated in the project remarked that &quot;In any envelope except nose down and full throttle&quot;, either the F-100 or F-105 was inferior to the F-86H in a dogfight. The project was generally successful in that the resulting tactics effectively minimized the disadvantages of the F-105, F-100 and other heavy American fighters while minimising the advantages of slower but more manoeuvrable fighters such as the F-86 and the MiG-17.

== Other MiG-17 users ==

Twenty countries flew MiG-17s. The MiG-17 became a standard fighter in all Warsaw Pact countries in the late 1950s and early 1960s. They were also bought by many other countries, mainly in Africa and Asia, that were neutrally aligned or allied with the USSR. The MiG-17 still flies today in the air forces of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Mali, Madagascar, Sudan, and Tanzania, and by extension through the Shenyang J-5, North Korea. JJ-5s trainers are still in limited use in China as well.

===Middle East===

The Egyptian Air Force received its first MiG-17s in 1956, deploying them against the Israeli invasion of the Sinai during the early stages of the Suez Crisis. When Britain and France launched air attacks against Egyptian air bases on 1 November 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered the Egyptian Air Force not to oppose the Anglo-French air strikes, and where possible to evacuate its aircraft to Syria or Saudi Arabia, so while Egypt lost large numbers of aircraft, including MiG-17s, losses of pilots were relatively low. The losses were quickly replaced after the end of the war, and by June 1957 Egypt had about 100 MiG-17s. Syria also operated the MiG-17, receiving 60 MiG-17Fs in 1957. The two air forces gradually switched the MiG-17 to ground-attack duties in the early 1960s, as the MiG-21 supplanted it in the interceptor role. From 1962, Egyptian forces became involved in the North Yemen Civil War, supporting the republican government, with Egyptian MiG-17s flying ground attack operations.

The MiG-17 formed a major part of the Arab air strength during the Six-Day War in June 1967. The war started with a massive airstrike by Israel against Egyptian, Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi airbases, with more than 150 Egyptian aircraft destroyed or damaged. Egypt&#x27;s surviving MiG-17s were heavily deployed in ground attacks against Israeli forces in the Sinai. The Soviet Union again replaced Egypt&#x27;s losses after the war, and Egypt was soon involved in the War of Attrition, a sustained series of armed clashes on and over Sinai, with Egypt&#x27;s MiG-17s continuing to be used in the ground attack role. While the MiG-17 was slower and shorter-ranged than the Sukhoi Su-7 that was the other main component of Egypt&#x27;s ground-attack forces, the MiG-17 was more manoeuvrable and sustained lower losses. From 1970, Egypt deployed detachments of MiG-17s to Sudan to support government forces during the First Sudanese Civil War. The MiG-17 continued in use in the Yom Kippur War. MiG-17s were used during the Ofira Air Battle by Egypt. Egyptian and Syrian MiG-17s retired shortly after these wars.

===Africa===
At least 24 of them served with the Nigerian Air Force and were flown by a mixed group of Nigerian and mercenary pilots from East Germany, Soviet Union, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Australia during the 1967–70 Nigerian Civil War.

===Asia===

Indonesian Air Force received up to 65 MiG-17 in 1959, consisted of Chinese-built Shenyang Type 56 and Polish-built Lim-5 and Lim-5P. On 9 March 1960, an Indonesian Air Force pilot affiliated with the Permesta movement strafed several strategic locations in the capital Jakarta, including the presidential palace, using a MiG-17 with tail number &quot;F-1112&quot;. During the Operation Trikora in 1961–1962, MiG-17s were deployed to the frontline airfields of Amahai, Morotai and Letfuan in eastern Indonesia to provide air cover against potential attack by the Dutch. The deterioration of relationships with Eastern Bloc countries following the 30 September Movement in 1965 and its subsequent anti-communist purge caused the Indonesian MiG-17 fleet to suffer maintenance problems due to lack of spare parts and support from foreign expert technicians. The MiG-17 along with most of Eastern Bloc type aircraft still in the Indonesian service were grounded in 1970. Two Lim-5 were sold to the United States in early 1970s and used by the USAF&#x27;s 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron.

Four were hurriedly supplied by the USSR to Sri Lanka during the 1971 insurgency and were used for bombing and ground attack in the brief insurgency.

===Soviet Union===
In 1958, a US Air Force Lockheed C-130 was shot down by four MiG-17 fighters when it flew into Soviet airspace near Yerevan, Armenia while on a Sun Valley Signal intelligence mission, with all 17 crew killed.

===United States===

A number of U.S. federal agencies undertook a program at Groom Lake to evaluate the MiG-17 to help fight the Vietnam War, as the kill ratio against North Vietnamese MiG-17s and MiG-21s was only 2:1. The program was code-named HAVE DRILL (see also Have Doughnut), involving trials of two ex-Syrian MiG-17F Frescos, acquired and provided by Israel, over the skies of Groom Lake. These aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they may be identified in DOD standard flight logs.

In addition to tracking the dog fights staged between the various MiG models against virtually every fighter in U.S. service, and against SAC&#x27;s B-52 Stratofortresses and B-58 Hustlers to test the ability of the bombers’ countermeasures systems, they also performed radar cross-section and propulsion tests that contributed greatly to improvements in U.S. aerial performance in Vietnam.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there are 17 privately owned MiG-17s in the US. Several MiG-17s have been seized due to questions over the legality of their import into the country.

<text>The Bab-el-Mandeb (Arabic: , , ), the Gate of Grief or the Gate of Tears, is a strait between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea in the Horn of Africa. It connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and by extension the Indian Ocean.

==Name==

The strait derives its name from the dangers attending its navigation or, according to an Arab legend, from the numbers who were drowned by an earthquake that separated the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa.

In &quot;Bab-el-Mandeb&quot;, &quot;Bab&quot; means &quot;gate&quot; while &quot;Mandeb&quot; means &quot;lamentation&quot; or &quot;grief&quot;.

==Geography==

The distance across is about from Ras Menheli in Yemen to Ras Siyyan in Djibouti. The island of Perim divides the strait into two channels, of which the eastern, known as the Bab Iskender (Alexander&#x27;s Strait), is wide and has a depth of deep, while the western, or Dact-el-Mayun, has a width of and a depth of . Near the coast of Djibouti lies a group of smaller islands known as the &quot;Seven Brothers&quot;. There is a surface current inwards in the eastern channel, but a strong undercurrent outwards in the western channel.

== Significance in the maritime trade route ==
The Bab-el-Mandeb acts as a strategic link between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Most exports of petroleum and natural gas from the Persian Gulf that transit the Suez Canal or the SUMED Pipeline pass through both the Bab el-Mandeb and the Strait of Hormuz. While the narrow width of the strait requires vessels to travel through the territorial sea of adjacent states, under the purview of Article 37 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the legal concept of transit passage applies to Bab el-Mandeb, although Eritrea (unlike the rest of coastal countries) is not a party to the convention.

Chokepoints are narrow channels along widely used global sea routes that are critical to global energy security. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is wide at its narrowest point, limiting tanker traffic to two 2-mile-wide channels for inbound and outbound shipments.

Closure of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait could keep tankers originating in the Persian Gulf from transiting the Suez Canal or reaching the SUMED Pipeline, forcing them to divert around the southern tip of Africa, which would increase transit time and shipping costs.

In 2006, an estimated of oil passed through the strait per day, out of a world total of about moved by tankers. This rose by 2014 to 5.1 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil, condensate and refined petroleum products headed toward Europe, the United States, and Asia, then an estimated 6.2 b/d by 2018. Total petroleum flows through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait accounted for about 9% of total seaborne-traded petroleum (crude oil and refined petroleum products) in 2017. About 3.6 million b/d moved north toward Europe; another 2.6 million b/d flowed in the opposite direction mainly to Asian markets such as Singapore, China, and India.

==History==
Paleo-environmental and tectonic events in the Miocene epoch created the Danakil Isthmus, a land bridge forming a broad connection between Yemen and Ethiopia. During the last 100,000 years, eustatic sea level fluctuations have led to alternate opening and closing of the straits. According to the recent single origin hypothesis, the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb were probably witness to the earliest migrations of modern humans. It is presumed that the oceans were then much lower and the straits were much shallower or dry, which allowed a series of emigrations along the southern coast of Asia.

According to Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church tradition, the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb were witness to the earliest migrations of Semitic Ge&#x27;ez speakers into Africa, occurring BC, roughly around the same time as the Hebrew patriarch Jacob. The Kingdom of Aksum was a major regional power in the Horn of Africa. It extended its rule across the strait with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom shortly before the rise of Islam.

The British East India Company unilaterally seized the island of Perim in 1799 on behalf of its Indian empire. The government of Britain asserted its ownership in 1857 and erected a lighthouse there in 1861, using it to command the Red Sea and the trade routes through the Suez Canal. It was used as a coaling station to refuel steamships until 1935 when the reduced use of coal as fuel rendered the operation unprofitable.

The British presence continued until 1967 when the island became part of the People&#x27;s Republic of South Yemen. Before the handover, the British government had put forward before the United Nations a proposal for the island to be internationalized as a way to ensure the continued security of passage and navigation in the Bab-el-Mandeb, but this was refused.
In 2008 a company owned by Tarek bin Laden unveiled plans to build a bridge named Bridge of the Horns across the strait, linking Yemen with Djibouti. Middle East Development LLC issued a notice to construct a bridge passing across the Red Sea that would be the longest suspended passing in the world. The project was assigned to engineering company COWI in collaboration with architect studio Dissing+Weitling, both from Denmark but the announced delay to Phase 1 in 2010 and the lack of any further updates since makes this a defunct project.

==Sub-region==
The Bab-el-Mandeb is also a sub-region in the Arab League, which includes Djibouti, Yemen, and Eritrea.

<doc id="62140" wikidata="Q1340791" url="?curid=62140" title="Geography of Somalia">
<text>Somalia is a country located in the Horn of Africa which officially consists of the intra-46th meridian east territory, the seven federal member states, namely Galmudug, Hirshabelle, Jubaland, South West, Puntland, and the municipality of Benadir. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Somali Sea and Guardafui Channel to the east, and Kenya to the southwest. With a land area of 637,657 square kilometers, Somalia&#x27;s terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands. Its coastline is more than 3,333 kilometers in length, the longest of mainland Africa. It has been described as being roughly shaped &quot;like a tilted number seven&quot;.

In the far north, the rugged east–west ranges of the Ogo Mountains lie at varying distances from the Gulf of Aden coast. Hot conditions prevail year-round, along with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall. Geology suggests the presence of valuable mineral deposits.

Somalia is separated from Seychelles by the Somali Sea and is separated from Socotra by the Guardafui Channel.

==Climate==

Due to Somalia&#x27;s proximity to the equator, there is not much seasonal variation in its climate. However, there are some very unpredictable rainfalls that occur sometimes. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with monsoon (periodic seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation) winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from , except at higher elevations and along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. In Mogadishu, for instance, average afternoon highs range from in April. Some of the highest mean annual temperatures in the world have been recorded in the country; Berbera on the northwestern coast has an afternoon high that averages more than from June through September. Nationally, mean daily minimums usually vary from about . The greatest range in climate occurs in northern Somalia, where temperatures sometimes surpass in July on the littoral plains and drop below the freezing point during December in the highlands. In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40 percent in the mid-afternoon to 85 percent at night, changing somewhat according to the season.

Unlike the climates of most other countries at this latitude, conditions in Somalia range from arid desert in the northeastern and central regions to semiarid steppe in the south and northwest. In the south, in the east Africa coastal forest, there are regions in which there is a tropical savanna climate. In the Cal Madow region of Somalia, there is cold steppe climate. In the northeast, annual rainfall is less than ; in the central plateaus, it is about . The northwestern and southwestern parts of the nation, however, receive considerably more rain, with an average of falling per year. Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically dry and hot. The Cal Madow and the Lag Badana national park are humid areas.

Most of the country receives less than of rain annually, and a large area encompassing the northeast and much of northern Somalia receives as little as . Certain higher areas in the north, however, record more than a year, as do some coastal sites. The southwest receives . Generally, rainfall takes the form of showers or localized torrential rains and is extremely variable. Mean daily maximum temperatures throughout the country range from , except at higher elevations and along the Somali Sea coast. Mean daily minimum temperatures vary from to more than . Northern Somalia experiences the greatest temperature extremes, with readings ranging from below freezing in the highlands in December to more than in July in the coastal plain skirting the Gulf of Aden. The north&#x27;s relative humidity ranges from about 40 percent in midafternoon to 85 percent at night, varying somewhat with the season. During the colder months, December to February, visibility at higher elevations is often restricted by fog. Temperatures in the south are less extreme, ranging from about . The hottest months are February through April. Coastal readings are usually five to ten degrees cooler than those inland. The coastal zone&#x27;s relative humidity usually remains about 70 percent even during the dry seasons.

There are four main seasons around which pastoral and agricultural life revolve, and these are dictated by shifts in the wind patterns. From December to March is the &quot;Jilal&quot;, the harshest dry season of the year. The main rainy season, referred to as the &quot;Gu&quot;, lasts from April to June. This period is characterized by the southwest monsoons, which rejuvenate the pasture land, especially the central plateau, and briefly transform the desert into lush vegetation. From July to September is the second dry season, the &quot;Xagaa&quot; (pronounced &quot;Hagaa&quot;). The &quot;Dayr&quot;, which is the shortest rainy season, lasts from October to December. The &quot;tangambili&quot; periods that intervene between the two monsoons (October–November and March–May) are hot and humid.

==Terrain, vegetation and drainage==
Physio-graphically, Somalia is a land of limited contrast. In the north, a maritime semidesert plain parallels the Gulf of Aden coast, varying in width from roughly twelve kilometers in the west to as little as two kilometers in the east. Scrub-covered, this plain, known as the Guban (scrub land), is crossed by broad, shallow watercourses that are beds of dry sand except in the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the vegetation, which is a combination of low bushes and grass clumps, is quickly renewed, and for a time the guban provides some grazing for nomad livestock. This coastal strip is part of the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion.

Inland from the gulf coast, the plain rises to the precipitous northward-facing cliffs of the dissected highlands. These form the rugged Karkaar mountain ranges that extend from the northwestern border with Ethiopia eastward to the tip of the Horn of Africa, where they end in sheer cliffs at Caseyr. The general elevation along the crest of these mountains averages about 1,800 meters above sea level south of the port town of Berbera, and eastward from that area it continues at 1,800 to 2,100 meters almost to Caseyr. The country&#x27;s highest point, Shimber Berris, which rises to 2,460 meters, is located near the town of Erigavo.

Southward the mountains descend, often in scarped ledges, to an elevated plateau devoid of perennial rivers. This region of broken mountain terrain, shallow plateau valleys, and usually dry watercourses is known to the Somalis as the Ogo.

In the Ogo&#x27;s especially arid eastern part, the plateau—broken by several isolated mountain ranges—gradually slopes toward the Somali Sea and in central Somalia constitutes the Mudug Plain. A major feature of this eastern section is the long and broad Nugaal Valley, with its extensive network of intermittent seasonal watercourses. The Nugaal river enters the Somali Sea at Eyl. The eastern area&#x27;s population consists mainly of pastoral nomads eking a living in a zone of low and erratic rainfall.

The western part of the Ogo plateau region is crossed by numerous shallow valleys and dry watercourses. Annual rainfall is greater than in the east, and there are flat areas of arable land that provide a home for dryland cultivators. Most important, the western area has permanent wells to which the predominantly nomadic population returns during the dry seasons. The western plateau slopes gently southward and merges imperceptibly into an area known as the Haud, a broad, undulating terrain that constitutes some of the best grazing lands for Somali nomads, despite the lack of appreciable rainfall more than half the year. Enhancing the value of the Haud are the natural depressions that during periods of rain become temporary lakes and ponds.

The Haud zone continues for more than sixty kilometers into Ethiopia, and the vast Somali Plateau, which lies between the northern Somali mountains and the highlands of southeast Ethiopia, extends south and eastward through Ethiopia into central and southwest Somalia. The portion of the Haud lying within Ethiopia was the subject of an agreement made during the colonial era. In 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis, the British &quot;returned&quot; the Haud (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably &#x27;protected&#x27; by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on an 1897 treaty in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against plundering by Somali clans. Britain included the proviso that the Somali nomads would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over them. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over. The stretch of land has since been a considerable source of regional strife.

Southwestern Somalia is dominated by the country&#x27;s only two permanent rivers, the Jubba and the Shabeelle. With their sources in the Ethiopian highlands, these rivers flow in a generally southerly direction, cutting wide valleys in the Somali Plateau as it descends toward the sea; the plateau&#x27;s elevation falls off rapidly in this area. The adjacent coastal zone, which includes the lower reaches of the rivers and extends from the Mudug Plain to the Kenyan border, averages 180 meters above sea level.

The Jubba River enters the Somali Sea at Kismaayo. Although the Shabeelle River at one time apparently also reached the sea near Merca, its course is thought to have changed in prehistoric times. The Shabeelle now turns southwestward near Balcad (about thirty kilometers north of Mogadishu) and parallels the coast for more than eighty-five kilometers. The river is perennial only to a point southwest of Mogadishu; thereafter it consists of swampy areas and dry reaches and is finally lost in the sand east of Jilib, not far from the Jubba River. During the flood seasons, the Shabeelle River may fill its bed to a point near Jilib and occasionally may even break through to the Jubba River farther south. Favorable rainfall and soil conditions make the entire riverine region a fertile agricultural area and the center of the country&#x27;s largest sedentary population.

In most of northern, northeastern, and north-central Somalia, where rainfall is low, the vegetation consists of scattered low trees, including various acacias, and widely scattered patches of grass. This vegetation gives way to a combination of low bushes and grass clumps in the highly arid areas of the northeast and along the Gulf of Aden.

As elevations and rainfall increase in the maritime ranges of the north, the vegetation becomes denser. Aloes are common, and on the higher plateau areas of the Ogo are woodlands. At a few places above 1,500 meters, the remnants of juniper forests (protected by the state) and areas of Euphorbia candelabrum (a chandelier-type spiny plant) occur. In the more arid highlands of the northeast, &quot;Boswellia&quot; and &quot;Commiphora&quot; trees are sources, respectively, of the frankincense and myrrh for which Somalia has been known since ancient times.

A broad plateau encompassing the northern city of Hargeysa, which receives comparatively heavy rainfall, is covered naturally by woodland (much of which has been degraded by overgrazing) and in places by extensive grasslands. Parts of this area have been under cultivation since the 1930s, producing sorghum and maize; in the 1990s it constituted the only significant region of sedentary cultivation outside southwestern Somalia.

The Haud south of Hargeysa is covered mostly by a semiarid woodland of scattered trees, mainly acacias, underlain by grasses that include species especially favored by livestock as forage. There vegetation forms spatially periodic patterns reminiscent of a tiger skin when viewed from above and therefore knowns as &quot;tiger bush&quot;. As the Haud merges into the Mudug Plain in central Somalia, the aridity increases and the vegetation takes on a subdesert character. Farther southward the terrain gradually changes to semiarid woodlands and grasslands as the annual precipitation increases.

The region encompassing the Shabeelle and Jubba rivers is relatively well watered and constitutes the country&#x27;s most arable zone. The lowland between the rivers supports rich pasturage. It features arid to subarid savanna, open woodland, and thickets that include frequently abundant underlying grasses. There are areas of grassland, and in the far southwest, near the Kenyan border, some dry evergreen forests are found.

Along the Somali Sea from Hobyo southwestward to near Mogadishu lies a stretch of dry coastal sand dunes, the Hobyo grasslands and shrublands ecoregion. This area is covered with scattered scrub and grass clumps where rainfall is sufficient although unpredictable. Much of this coast is thinly populated but overgrazing, particularly south of Mogadishu, has resulted in the destruction of the protective vegetation cover and the gradual movement of the once-stationary dunes inland. The original flora of this coast contains a number of endemic species and beginning in the early 1970s, efforts were made to stabilize these dunes by replanting. Endemic mammals are the silver dik-dik (&quot;Madoqua piacentinii&quot;), one of the world&#x27;s smallest antelopes, and the Somali golden mole (&quot;Calcochloris tytonis&quot;). Other endemic species include two reptiles, a skink&quot; Haackgreerius miopus&quot; and a lizard &quot;Latastia cherchii&quot; and two birds, Ash&#x27;s lark (&quot;Mirafra ashi&quot;) and the Obbia lark (&quot;Spizocorys obbiensis&quot;). The long-term political strife in Somalia has meant the coast is poorly studied and the state of the habitat unknown.

Other vegetation includes plants and grasses found in the swamps into which the Shabeelle River empties most of the year and in other large swamps in the course of the lower Jubba River. Swamps of East African mangroves are found at points along the coast, particularly from Kismaayo to near the Kenyan border. Uncontrolled exploitation appears to have caused some damage to forests in that area. Other mangroves are located near Mogadishu and at a number of places along the northeastern and northern coasts.

<text>The Horn of Africa (HoA), also known as the Somali Peninsula, is a large peninsula and geopolitical region in East Africa. Located on the easternmost part of the African mainland, it is the fourth largest peninsula in the world and is composed of the four countries Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Although not common, broader definitions include parts or all of Kenya and Sudan. It has been described as a region of geopolitical and strategic importance since it is situated along the southern boundary of the Red Sea; extending hundreds of kilometres into the Gulf of Aden, Guardafui Channel, and Indian Ocean. It also shares a maritime border with the Arabian Peninsula.

==Names==
This peninsula has been known by various names. Ancient Greeks and Romans referred to it as Regio Aromatica or Regio Cinnamonifora due to the aromatic plants found there, or as Regio Incognita owing to its uncharted territory. In ancient and medieval times, the Horn of Africa was referred to as the Bilad al Barbar (&quot;Land of the Berbers&quot;). It is also known as the &quot;Somali Peninsula,&quot; or in the Somali language as &quot;Geeska Afrika or&quot; &quot;Jasiiradda Soomaali&quot;. In other local languages it is called &quot;Horn of Africa&quot; or the &quot;African Horn&quot;, in Amharic የአፍሪካ ቀንድ &quot;yäafrika qänd,&quot; in Arabic القرن الأفريقي &quot;al-qarn al-&#x27;afrīqī&quot;, in Oromo &quot;Gaanfaa Afrikaa&quot;, and in Tigrinya ቀርኒ ኣፍሪቃ &quot;q&#x27;ärnī afīrīqa&quot;.

==Description==
The Horn of Africa Region consists of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somaliland and Somalia.

Geographically the protruding shape that resembles a &quot;Horn&quot; consists of the &quot;Somali peninsula&quot; and eastern part of Ethiopia. But the region encompasses also the rest of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti. Broader definitions include Kenya and Sudan. The term Greater Horn Region (GHR) can additionally include South Sudan and Uganda. The term &quot;Greater Horn of Africa&quot; is sometimes used to be inclusive of neighbouring southeast African countries to distinguish the broader geopolitical definition of the Horn of Africa from narrower peninsular definitions.

The name Horn of Africa is sometimes shortened to &quot;HoA&quot;. Quite commonly it is referred to simply as &quot;the Horn&quot;, while inhabitants are sometimes colloquially termed &quot;Horn Africans&quot; or &quot;Horners&quot;. Regional studies on the Horn of Africa are carried out in fields of Ethiopian studies and Somali studies. This peninsula has been known by various names. Ancient Greeks and Romans referred to it as Regio Aromatica or &quot;Regio Cinnamonifora&quot; due to the aromatic plants or as &quot;Regio Incognita&quot; owing to its uncharted territory.

==History==
===Prehistory===

Some of the earliest &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossils, the Omo remains (from ca. 233,000 years ago) and the Herto skull (from ca. 160,000 ago) have been found in the region, both in Ethiopia.

The findings of the Earliest Stone Tipped Projectiles from the Ethiopian Rift dated to more than 279,000 years ago &quot;in combination with the existing archaeological, fossil and genetic evidence, isolate East Africa as a source of modern cultures and biology.&quot;

According to the Southern Dispersal scenario, the Southern route of the Out of Africa migration occurred in the Horn of Africa through the Bab el Mandeb. Today at the Bab-el-Mandeb straits, the Red Sea is about wide, but 50,000 years ago it was much narrower and sea levels were 70 meters lower. Though the straits were never completely closed, there may have been islands in between which could be reached using simple rafts. Shell middens 125,000 years old have been found in Eritrea, indicating the diet of early humans included seafood obtained by beachcombing.

Ethiopian and Eritrean agriculture established the earliest known use of the seed grass teff (&quot;Poa abyssinica&quot;) between 4000 and 1000 BCE. Teff is used to make the flatbread injera/taita. Coffee also originated in Ethiopia and has since spread to become a worldwide beverage.

Historian Christopher Ehret, cited genetic evidence which had identified the Horn of Africa as a source of a genetic marker &quot;M35/215&quot; Y-chromosome lineage for a significant population component which moved north from that region into Egypt and the Levant. Ehret argued that this genetic distribution paralleled the spread of the Afrasian language family with the movement of people from the Horn of Africa into Egypt and added a new demic component to the existing population of Egypt 17,000 years ago.

=== Ancient history ===

The area comprising Somaliland, Somalia, Djibouti, the Red Sea coast of Eritrea and Sudan is considered the most likely location of the land known to the ancient Egyptians as &quot;Punt&quot; (or &quot;Ta Netjeru&quot;, meaning god&#x27;s land), whose first mention dates to the 25th century BCE.

Dʿmt was a kingdom located in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, which existed during the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. With its capital probably at Yeha, the kingdom developed irrigation schemes, used plows, grew millet, and made iron tools and weapons. After the fall of Dʿmt in the 5th century BCE, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms, until the rise of one of these kingdoms during the 1st century, the Aksumite Kingdom, which was able to reunite the area.

The Kingdom of Aksum (also known as the Aksumite Empire) was an ancient state located in the Eritrea and Ethiopian highlands, which thrived between the 1st and 7th centuries CE. A major player in the commerce between the Roman Empire and Ancient India, Aksum&#x27;s rulers facilitated trade by minting their own currency. The state also established its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. Under Ezana (fl. 320–360), the kingdom of Aksum became the first major empire to adopt Christianity, and was named by Mani as one of the four great powers of his time, along with Persia, Rome and China.

Somalia was an important link in the Horn, connecting the region&#x27;s commerce with the rest of the ancient world. Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of frankincense, myrrh and spices, all of which were valuable luxuries to the Ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Mycenaeans, Babylonians and Romans. The Romans consequently began to refer to the region as &quot;Regio Aromatica&quot;. In the classical era, several flourishing Somali city-states such as Opone, Mosylon and Malao also competed with the Sabaeans, Parthians and Axumites for the rich Indo-Greco-Roman trade.

The birth of Islam opposite the Horn&#x27;s Red Sea coast meant that local merchants and sailors living on the Arabian Peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted Arab Muslim trading partners. With the migration of Muslim families from the Islamic world to the Horn in the early centuries of Islam, and the peaceful conversion of the local population by Muslim scholars in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into Islamic Mogadishu, Berbera, Zeila, Barawa and Merka, which were part of the &quot;Barbara civilization&quot;. The city of Mogadishu came to be known as the &quot;City of Islam&quot; and controlled the East African gold trade for several centuries.

===Middle Ages and Early Modern era===

During the Middle Ages, several powerful empires dominated the regional trade in the Horn, including the Adal Sultanate, the Ajuran Sultanate, the Ethiopian Empire, the Zagwe dynasty, and the Sultanate of the Geledi.

The Sultanate of Showa, established in 896, was one of the oldest local Islamic states. It was centered in the former Shewa province in central Ethiopia. The polity was succeeded by the Sultanate of Ifat around 1285. Ifat was governed from its capital at Zeila in Somaliland and was the easternmost district of the former Shewa Sultanate.

The Adal Sultanate was a medieval multi-ethnic Muslim state centered in the Horn region. At its height, it controlled large parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea. Many of the historic cities in the region, such as Amud, Maduna, Abasa, Berbera, Zeila and Harar, flourished during the kingdom&#x27;s golden age. This period that left behind numerous courtyard houses, mosques, shrines and walled enclosures. Under the leadership of rulers such as Sabr ad-Din II, Mansur ad-Din, Jamal ad-Din II, Shams ad-Din, General Mahfuz and Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, Adalite armies continued the struggle against the Solomonic dynasty, a campaign historically known as the Conquest of Abyssinia or &quot;Futuh al Habash&quot;.

Through a strong centralized administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the Ajuran Sultanate successfully resisted an Oromo invasion from the west and a Portuguese incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of Somali maritime enterprise were also strengthened or re-established, and the state left behind an extensive architectural legacy. Many of the hundreds of ruined castles and fortresses that dot the landscape of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran engineers, including a lot of the pillar tomb fields, necropolises and ruined cities built during that era. The royal family, the House of Gareen, also expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances.

The Zagwe dynasty ruled many parts of modern Ethiopia and Eritrea from approximately 1137 to 1270. The name of the dynasty comes from the Cushitic-speaking Agaw people of northern Ethiopia. From 1270 onwards for many centuries, the Solomonic dynasty ruled the Ethiopian Empire.

In 1270, the Amhara nobleman Yekuno Amlak, who claimed descent from the last Aksumite king and ultimately the Queen of Sheba, overthrew the Agaw Zagwe dynasty at the Battle of Ansata, ushering his reign as Emperor of Ethiopia. While initially a rather small and politically unstable entity, the empire managed to expand significantly during the crusades of Amda Seyon I (1314–1344) and his successors, becoming the dominant force in East Africa.

In the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since Aksumite times. A letter from King Henry IV of England to the Emperor of Abyssinia survives. In 1428, the Emperor Yeshaq sent two emissaries to Alfonso V of Aragon, who sent return emissaries who failed to complete the return trip.

The first continuous relations with a European country began in 1508 with Portugal under Emperor Lebna Dengel, who had just inherited the throne from his father. This proved to be an important development, for when Abyssinia was subjected to the attacks of the Adal Sultanate General and Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (called &quot;&quot;Gurey&quot; or &quot;Grañ&quot;&quot;, both meaning &quot;the Left-handed&quot;), Portugal assisted the Ethiopian emperor by sending weapons and four hundred men, who helped his son Gelawdewos defeat Ahmad and re-establish his rule. This Ethiopian–Adal War was also one of the first proxy wars in the region as the Ottoman Empire, and Portugal took sides in the conflict.

When Emperor Susenyos converted to Roman Catholicism in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed resulting in thousands of deaths. The Jesuit missionaries had offended the Orthodox faith of the local Ethiopians. On 25 June 1632, Susenyos&#x27;s son, Emperor Fasilides, declared the state religion to again be Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and expelled the Jesuit missionaries and other Europeans.

During the end of 18th and the beginning of 19th century the Yejju dynasty (more specifically, the Warasek) ruled north Ethiopia changing the official language of Amhara people to Afaan Oromo, including inside the court of Gondar which was capital of the empire. Founded by Ali I of Yejju several successive descendants of him and Abba Seru Gwangul ruled with their army coming from mainly their clan the Yejju Oromo tribe as well as Wollo and Raya Oromo.


The Sultanate of the Geledi was a Somali kingdom administered by the Gobroon dynasty, which ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was established by the Ajuran soldier Ibrahim Adeer, who had defeated various vassals of the Ajuran Empire and established the &quot;House of Gobroon&quot;. The dynasty reached its apex under the successive reigns of Sultan Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim, who successfully consolidated Gobroon power during the Bardera wars, and Sultan Ahmed Yusuf, who forced regional powers such as the Omani Empire to submit tribute.

The Isaaq Sultanate was a Somali kingdom that ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. It spanned the territories of the Isaaq clan, descendants of the Banu Hashim clan, in modern-day Somaliland and Ethiopia. The sultanate was governed by the Reer Guled branch of the Eidagale sub-clan established by the first sultan, Sultan Guled Abdi. The sultanate is the pre-colonial predecessor to the modern Somaliland.

According to oral tradition, prior to the Guled dynasty the Isaaq clan-family were ruled by a dynasty of the Tolje&#x27;lo branch starting from, descendants of Ahmed nicknamed Tol Je&#x27;lo, the eldest son of Sheikh Ishaaq&#x27;s Harari wife. There were eight Tolje&#x27;lo rulers in total, starting with Boqor Harun () who ruled the Isaaq Sultanate for centuries starting from the 13th century. The last Tolje&#x27;lo ruler Garad Dhuh Barar () was overthrown by a coalition of Isaaq clans. The once strong Tolje&#x27;lo clan were scattered and took refuge amongst the Habr Awal with whom they still mostly live.

The Majeerteen Sultanate (Migiurtinia) was another prominent Somali sultanate based in the Horn region. Ruled by King Osman Mahamuud during its golden age, it controlled much of northeastern and central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. It also entered into treaties with foreign powers and exerted strong centralized authority on the domestic front. Much of the Sultanate&#x27;s former domain is today coextensive with the autonomous Puntland region in northern Somalia.

The Sultanate of Hobyo was a 19th-century Somali kingdom founded by Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid. Initially, Kenadid&#x27;s goal was to seize control of the neighboring Majeerteen Sultanate, which was then ruled by his cousin Boqor Osman Mahamuud. However, he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and was eventually forced into exile in Yemen. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the Arabian Peninsula with a band of Hadhrami musketeers and a group of devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to establish the kingdom of Hobyo, which would rule much of northern and central Somalia during the early modern period.

===Modern history===

In the period following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, when European powers scrambled for territory in Africa and tried to establish coaling stations for their ships, Italy invaded and occupied Eritrea. On 1 January 1890, Eritrea officially became a colony of Italy. In 1896 further Italian incursion into the horn was decisively halted by Ethiopian forces. By 1936 however, Eritrea became a province of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana), along with Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland. By 1941, Eritrea had about 760,000 inhabitants, including 70,000 Italians. The Commonwealth armed forces, along with the Ethiopian patriotic resistance, expelled those of Italy in 1941, and took over the area&#x27;s administration. The British continued to administer the territory under a UN Mandate until 1951, when Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia, per UN resolution 390 A (V) adopted December 1950.

The strategic importance of Eritrea, due to its Red Sea coastline and mineral resources, was the main cause for the federation with Ethiopia, which in turn led to Eritrea&#x27;s annexation as Ethiopia&#x27;s 14th province in 1962. This was the culmination of a gradual process of takeover by the Ethiopian authorities, a process which included a 1959 edict establishing the compulsory teaching of Amharic, the main language of Ethiopia, in all Eritrean schools. The lack of regard for the Eritrean population led to the formation of an independence movement in the early 1960s (1961), which erupted into a 30-year war against successive Ethiopian governments that ended in 1991. Following a UN-supervised referendum in Eritrea (dubbed UNOVER) in which the Eritrean people overwhelmingly voted for independence, Eritrea declared its independence and gained international recognition in 1993. In 1998, a border dispute with Ethiopia led to the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.



From 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura situated in modern-day Djibouti was called &quot;Obock&quot; and was ruled by Somali and Afar Sultans, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region. In 1894, Léonce Lagarde established a permanent French administration in the city of Djibouti and named the region &quot;Côte française des Somalis&quot; (French Somaliland), a name which continued until 1967.

In 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia&#x27;s independence in 1960, a referendum was held in the territory to decide whether to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum favoured continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also reports of widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the polls. The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later. Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977. Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali politician who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, became the nation&#x27;s first president (1977–1999). In early 2011, the Djiboutian citizenry took part in a series of protests against the long-serving government, which were associated with the larger Arab Spring demonstrations. The unrest eventually subsided by April of the year, and Djibouti&#x27;s ruling People&#x27;s Rally for Progress party was re-elected to office.

The Dervish existed for 25 years, from 1895 until 1920. The Turks named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation, and the Germans promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire. After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 as a direct consequence of Britain&#x27;s new policy of aerial bombardment. As a result of this bombardment, former Dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of Britain. Italy faced similar opposition from Somali Sultans and armies, and did not acquire full control of modern Somalia until the Fascist era in late 1927. This occupation lasted until 1941, and was replaced by a British military administration. Former British Somaliland would remain, along with Italian Somaliland, a trusteeship of Italy, between 1950 and 1960. The Union of the two countries in 1960 formed the Somali Republic. A civilian government was formed, and on 20 July 1961, through a popular referendum, the constitution drafted in 1960 was ratified.

Due to its longstanding ties with the Arab world, the Somali Republic was accepted in 1974 as a member of the Arab League. During the same year, the nation&#x27;s former socialist administration also chaired the Organization of African Unity, the predecessor of the African Union. In 1991, the Somali Civil War broke out, which saw the dissolving of the union and Somaliland regaining its independence, along with the collapse of the central government and the emergence of numerous autonomous polities, including the Puntland administration in the north. Somalia&#x27;s inhabitants subsequently reverted to local forms of conflict resolution, either secular, Islamic or customary law, with a provision for appeal of all sentences. A Transitional Federal Government was subsequently created in 2004. The Federal Government of Somalia was established on 20 August 2012, concurrent with the end of the TFG&#x27;s interim mandate. It represents the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war. The Federal Parliament of Somalia serves as the government&#x27;s legislative branch.

Modern Ethiopia and its current borders are a result of significant territorial reduction in the north and expansion in the east and south toward its present borders, owing to several migrations, commercial integration, treaties as well as conquests, particularly by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena. From the central province of Shoa, Menelik set off to subjugate and incorporate &#x27;the lands and people of the South, East and West into an empire.&#x27; He did this with the help of Ras Gobena&#x27;s Shewan Oromo militia, began expanding his kingdom to the south and east, expanding into areas that had not been held since the invasion of Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, and other areas that had never been under his rule, resulting in the borders of Ethiopia of today. Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889, in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia&#x27;s sovereignty so long as Italy could control a small area of northern Tigray (part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with arms and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to further expand their territorial claims. Italy began a state funded program of resettlement for landless Italians in Eritrea, which increased tensions between the Eritrean peasants and the Italians. This conflict erupted in the Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896, in which Italy&#x27;s colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.

The early 20th century in Ethiopia was marked by the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie I, who came to power after Iyasu V was deposed. In 1935, Haile Selassie&#x27;s troops fought and lost the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, after which Italy annexed Ethiopia to Italian East Africa. Haile Selassie subsequently appealed to the League of Nations, delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure and 1935&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; magazine Man of the Year. Following the entry of Italy into World War II, British Empire forces, together with patriot Ethiopian fighters, liberated Ethiopia during the East African Campaign in 1941.

Haile Selassie&#x27;s reign came to an end in 1974, when a Soviet-backed Marxist-Leninist military junta, the Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, deposed him, and established a one-party communist state, which was called the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. In July 1977, the Ogaden War broke out after the Somalia government of Siad Barre sought to incorporate the predominantly Somali-inhabited Ogaden region into a Pan-Somali Greater Somalia. By September 1977, the Somali army controlled 90 percent of the Ogaden, but was later forced to withdraw after Ethiopia&#x27;s Derg received assistance from the USSR, Cuba, South Yemen, East Germany and North Korea, including around 15,000 Cuban combat troops.

In 1989, the Tigrayan Peoples&#x27; Liberation Front (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the Ethiopian Peoples&#x27; Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), and eventually managed to overthrow Mengistu&#x27;s dictatorial regime in 1991. A transitional government, composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution, was then set up. The first free and democratic election took place later in 1995, when Ethiopia&#x27;s longest-serving Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was elected to office. As with other nations in the Horn region, Ethiopia maintained its historically close relations with countries in the Middle East during this period of change. Zenawi died in 2012, but his Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) party remains the ruling political coalition in Ethiopia.

==Geography==

===Geology and climate===
The Horn of Africa is almost equidistant from the equator and the Tropic of Cancer. It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a fissure in the Earth&#x27;s crust extending from Turkey to Mozambique and marking the separation of the African and Arabian tectonic plates. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.

Geologically, the Horn and Yemen once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the Gulf of Aden rifted and separated the Horn region from the Arabian Peninsula. The Somali Plate is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the triple junction in the Afar Depression, and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the Aden Ridge along the coast of Saudi Arabia. The eastern boundary is the Central Indian Ridge, the northern portion of which is also known as the Carlsberg Ridge. The southern boundary is the Southwest Indian Ridge.

Extensive glaciers once covered the Simien and Bale Mountains but melted at the beginning of the Holocene. The mountains descend in a huge escarpment to the Red Sea and more steadily to the Indian Ocean. Socotra is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is and it is a territory of Yemen.

The lowlands of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical monsoons that give seasonal rains to the Sahel and the Sudan blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and northern part of Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.

In the mountains of Ethiopia, many areas receive over per year, and even Asmara receives an average of . This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including Egypt. In the winter, the northeasterly trade winds do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as . On the eastern coast, a strong upwelling and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as .

The climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At Addis Ababa, which ranges from , maximum temperature is and minimum . The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (&quot;belg&quot;) rains occur from February to April and the big (&quot;meher&quot;) rains from mid-June to mid-September. The Danakil Desert stretches across 100,000 km2 of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45 °C and often surpassing 50 °C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among these are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the Danakil Depression. The Afrera contains many active volcanoes, including the Maraho, Dabbahu, Afdera and Erta Ale.

In Somalia, there is not much seasonal variation in climate. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from , except at higher elevations along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. Somalia has only two permanent rivers, the Jubba and the Shabele, both of which begin in the Ethiopian Highlands.

===Ecology===

About 220 mammals are found in the Horn of Africa. Among threatened species of the region, there are several antelopes such as the beira, the dibatag, the silver dikdik and the Speke&#x27;s gazelle. Other remarkable species include the Somali wild ass, the desert warthog, the hamadryas baboon, the Somali pygmy gerbil, the ammodile, and the Speke&#x27;s pectinator. The Grevy&#x27;s zebra is the unique wild equid of the region. There are predators such as spotted hyena, striped hyena and African leopard. The endangered painted hunting dog had populations in the Horn of Africa, but pressures from human exploitation of habitat along with warfare have reduced or extirpated this canid in this region.

Some important bird species of the Horn are the black boubou, the golden-winged grosbeak, the Warsangli linnet, and the Djibouti spurfowl.

The Horn of Africa holds more endemic reptiles than any other region in Africa, with over 285 species total and about 90 species which are found exclusively in the region. Among endemic reptile genera, there are &quot;Haackgreerius&quot;, &quot;Haemodracon&quot;, &quot;Ditypophis&quot;, &quot;Pachycalamus&quot; and &quot;Aeluroglena&quot;. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, amphibians are poorly represented in the region.

There are about 100 species of freshwater fish in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, three cavefishes, Somali blind barb, &quot;Phreatichthys andruzzii&quot; and &quot;Uegitglanis zammaranoi&quot; can be found.

It is estimated that about 5,000 species of vascular plants are found in the Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant families: the Barbeyaceae and the Dirachmaceae. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra, the Bankoualé palm, the yeheb nut, and the Somali cyclamen.

Due to the Horn of Africa&#x27;s semi-arid and arid climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region&#x27;s pastoral groups have observed careful rangeland management practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983–85, 1991–92, 1998–99 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37 and 62 percent of the cattle population. Initiatives by ECHO and USAID have succeeded in reclaiming hundreds of hectares of pastureland through rangeland management, leading to the establishment of the Dikale Rangeland in 2004.

As of 2023, the Horn of Africa is affected by a severe ongoing drought and famine that has been going on for six consecutive years, especially in Somalia and in the months from March to May during which 60 percent of the annual rainfall occurs. It is estimated that the lives of a number of people ranging from 22 to 58 million are at risk.

==Demographics, ethnicity and languages==

Besides sharing similar geographic endowments, the countries of the Horn of Africa are, for the most part, linguistically and ethnically linked together, evincing a complex pattern of interrelationships among the various groups. The two main macro groups in the Horn are the Cushitic-speaking Cushitic peoples traditionally centered in the lowlands and the Ethiosemitic-speaking Habesha peoples who inhabit the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands.

According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, there are 10 individual languages spoken in Djibouti (two native), 14 in Eritrea, 90 in Ethiopia, 15 in Somalia (Somali being the only native). Most people in the Horn speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic, Semitic, or Omotic branches. The Cushitic branch includes Oromo, spoken by the Oromo people in Ethiopia, and Somali, spoken by the Somali people in Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya; the Semitic branch (specifically the Ethiosemitic sub-branch) includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara people of Ethiopia, and Tigrinya spoken by the Tigrayan people of Ethiopia and the Tigrinya people of Eritrea. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Afar, Saho, Hadiyya, Sidamo and Agaw languages, the Semitic Tigre, Arabic, Gurage, Harari, Silt&#x27;e and Argobba tongues as well as Omotic languages are spoken by Omotic communities inhabiting Ethiopia&#x27;s southern regions. Among these languages are Aari, Dizi, Gamo, Kafa, Hamer and Wolaytta.

Languages belonging to the Nilo-Saharan language family are also spoken in some areas by Nilotic ethnic minorities mostly in Ethiopia and Eritrea. These tongues include the Nilo-Saharan Me&#x27;en and Mursi languages used in southwestern Ethiopia, and Kunama and Nara idioms spoken in parts of southern Eritrea.

Languages belonging to the Niger-Congo language family are also spoken in some areas by Bantu ethnic minorities in Somalia. In the riverine and littoral areas of southern Somalia, Bajuni, Barawani, and Bantu groups also speak variants of the Niger-Congo Swahili and Mushunguli languages.

The Horn has produced numerous indigenous writing systems. Among these is Ge&#x27;ez script ( &#x27;) (also known as &quot;Ethiopic&quot;), which has been written in for at least 2000 years. It is an abugida script that was originally developed to write the Ge&#x27;ez language. In speech communities that use it, such as the Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called &#x27; (), which means &quot;script&quot; or &quot;alphabet&quot;.
For centuries, Somali sheikhs and Sultans used wadaad&#x27;s writing (a version of the Arabic alphabet) to write. In the early 20th century, in response to a national campaign to settle on a writing script for the Somali language (which had long since lost its ancient script), Osman Yusuf Kenadid, a Somali poet and remote cousin of the Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo, devised a phonetically sophisticated alphabet called Osmanya (also known as &quot;far soomaali&quot;; Osmanya: 𐒍𐒖𐒇 𐒈𐒝𐒑𐒛𐒐𐒘) for representing the sounds of Somali. Though no longer the official writing script in Somalia, the Osmanya script is available in the Unicode range 10480-104AF [from U+10480 – U+104AF (66688–66735)].
A number of ethnic minority groups in southern Ethiopia and Eritrea also adhere to various traditional faiths. Among these belief systems are the Nilo-Saharan Surma people&#x27;s acknowledgment of the sky god &quot;Tumu&quot;.

==Economy==
According to the IMF, in 2010 the Horn of Africa region had a total GDP (PPP) of $106.224 billion and nominal of $35.819 billion. Per capita, the GDP in 2010 was $1061 (PPP) and $358 (nominal).

Over 95 percent of cross-border trade within the region is unofficial and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to other countries in the Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including Somalia and Djibouti, generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure), with the towns of Burao and Yirowe in Somaliland being home to the largest livestock markets in the Horn of Africa, with as many as 10,000 heads of sheep and goats sold daily from all over the Horn of Africa, with many of whom shipped to Gulf states via the port of Berbera. This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.

<doc id="62143" wikidata="Q1982564" url="?curid=62143" title="Geography of Ethiopia">
<text>Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. Ethiopia has a high central plateau, the Abyssinian Highlands (or Ethiopian Highlands) that varies from above sea level, with some 25 mountains whose peaks rise over 4,000 meters (13,200ft), the highest being Ras Dashen at 4,543 meters (14,538ft).

Elevation is generally highest just before the point of descent to the Great Rift Valley, which splits the plateau diagonally. A number of rivers cross the plateau; notably the Blue Nile rising from Lake Tana. The plateau gradually slopes to the lowlands of the Sudan on the west and the Somali-inhabited plains to the east. Ethiopia&#x27;s westernmost locality is Pibor River opposite the Sudanese village of Denjok. Its easternmost locality lies along the eastern border of Dollo Zone opposite Puntland and Galmudug states.

==Physical features==

=== Geography ===
Between the valley of the Upper Nile and Ethiopia&#x27;s border with Sudan and South Sudan is a region of elevated plateaus from which rise the various tablelands and mountains that constitute the Ethiopian Highlands. On nearly every side, the walls of the plateaus rise abruptly from the plains, constituting outer mountain chains. The highlands are thus a clearly marked geographic division. In Eritrea, the eastern wall of this plateau runs parallel to the Red Sea from Ras Kasar (18° N) to Annesley Bay (also known as the Bay of Zula) (15° N). It then turns due south into Ethiopia and follows closely the line of 40° E for some .

About 9° N there is a break in the wall, through which the Awash River flows eastward. The main range at this point trends southwest, while south of the Awash Valley, which is some below the level of the mountains, another massif rises in a direct line south. This second range sends a chain (the Ahmar Mountains) eastward toward the Gulf of Aden.

The two chief eastern ranges maintain a parallel course south by west, with a broad upland valley in between – in which valley are a series of lakes – to about 3° N, the outer (eastern) spurs of the plateau still keeping along the line of 40° E. The southern escarpment of the plateau is highly irregular, but has a general direction northwest and southeast from 6° N to 3° N. It overlooks the depression in which is Lake Turkana and – east of that lake – the southern Debub Omo Zone (part of the larger Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region).

The western wall of the plateau from 6° N to 11° N is well marked and precipitous. North of 11° N the hills turn more to the east and fall more gradually to the East Sudanian savanna plains at their base. On its northern face, the plateau falls in terraces to the level of the eastern Sudan.

The eastern escarpment is the best defined of these outer ranges. It has a mean height of , and in many places rises almost perpendicularly from the plain. Narrow and deep clefts, through which descend mountain torrents that lose themselves in the sandy soil of the Eritrean coast, afford means of reaching the plateau, or the easier route through the Awash Valley may be chosen. On surmounting this rocky barrier, the traveller finds that the encircling rampart rises little above the normal level of the plateau.

The physical aspect of the highlands is impressive. The northern portion lies mainly between 10° and 15° N. It consists of a huge mass of Archaean rocks with a mean height of above sea level, and is flooded in a deep central depression by the waters of Lake Tana. Above the plateau rise several irregular and generally ill-defined mountain ranges which attain altitudes of from to just under . Many of the mountains are of unusual shape.

Characteristic of the country are the enormous fissures which divide it, formed over time by the erosive action of water. They are the valleys of the rivers, which rising on the uplands or mountain sides, have cut their way to the surrounding lowlands. Some of the valleys are of considerable width; in other cases the opposite walls of the gorges are but two or three hundred meters apart, and fall almost vertically thousands of meters, representing an erosion of many hundred thousands cubic metres of hard rock. One result of the action of the water has been the formation of numerous isolated flat-topped hills or small plateaus, known as &quot;ambas&quot;, with nearly perpendicular sides.

The highest peaks are found in the Semien and Bale ranges. The Semien Mountains lie northeast of Lake Tana and culminate in the snow-covered peak of Ras Dashen, which has an altitude of . A few kilometers east and north respectively of Ras Dashen are Mounts Biuat and Abba Yared, whose summits are less than below that of Ras Dashen.

The Bale Mountains are separated from the larger part of the Ethiopian highlands by the Great Rift Valley, one of the longest and most profound chasms in Ethiopia. The highest peaks of that range include Tullu Demtu, the second-highest mountain in Ethiopia (), Batu (), Chilalo () and Mount Kaka ().

Parallel with the eastern escarpment are the heights of Biala, , Mount Abuna Yosef, , and Kollo, , the last-named being southwest of Magdala. Between Lake Tana and the eastern hills are Mounts Guna, , and Uara Sahia, . In the Choqa Mountains of Misraq Gojjam, Mount Choqa (also known as Mount Birhan) attains a height of .

Below 10° N, the southern portion of the highlands has more open tableland than the northern portion and fewer lofty peaks. Though there are a few heights between , the majority do not exceed , but the general character of the southern regions is the same as in the north: a much-broken hilly plateau.

East of the highlands towards the Red Sea there is a strip of lowland semi-desert, the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands.

=== Hydrology ===
Most of the Ethiopian uplands have a decided slope to the northwest, so that nearly all the large rivers flow in that direction to the Nile, comprising some 85% of its water. Such are the Tekezé River in the north, the Abay in the center, and the Sobat in the south, and about four-fifths of the entire drainage is discharged through these three arteries. Another large river is the south-flowing Omo, with 14% of the entire drainage the largest river outside the above-mentioned three main arteries discharging to the west, and by far the main feeder of the endorheic Turkana Basin with Lake Turkana. The rest is carried off by the Awash, which runs out in the saline lacustrine district along the border with Djibouti; by the Shebelle River and the Jubba, which flow southeast through Somalia, though the Shebelle most often fails to reach the Indian Ocean.

The Tekezé River, which is the true upper course of the Atbarah River, has its headwaters in the central tableland; and falls from about . in the tremendous crevasse through which it sweeps west, north, forming part of the border with Eritrea, and west again down to the western terraces, where it passes from Ethiopia to Sudan. During the rains the Tekezé (i.e. the &quot;Terrible&quot;) rises some above its normal level, and at this time forms an impassable barrier between the northern and central regions. In its lower course, the river is known by the Arabic name Setit.

In Sudan, the Setit is joined (at ) by the Atbarah, a river formed by several streams which rise in the mountains west and northwest of Lake Tana. The Gash or Mareb, which forms part of the border with Eritrea, is the most northerly of the highland rivers which flow toward the Nile valley. Its headwaters rise on the landward side of the eastern escarpment within 80 km of Annesley Bay on the Red Sea. It reaches the Sudanese plains near Kassala, beyond which place its waters are dissipated in the sandy soil. The Mareb is dry for a great part of the year, but like the Takazze is subject to sudden freshets during the rainy season. Only the left bank of the upper course of the river is in Ethiopian territory.

The Abay – that is, the upper course of the Blue Nile – has its source near Mount Denguiza in the Choqa mountains, around . It first flows for nearly due north to the south shore of Lake Tana. Tana, which stands below the normal level of the plateau, has somewhat the physical aspect of a flooded crater. It has an area of about , and a depth in some parts of . At the southeast corner the rim of the crater is, as it were, breached by a deep crevasse through which the Abay escapes, and here makes a great semicircular bend like that of the Tekezé, but in the reverse direction – east, south and north-west – down to the plains of Sennar, where it takes the name of Bahr-el-Azrak or Blue Nile.The Abay has many tributaries. Of these, the Bashilo rises near Magdala and drains eastern Amhara; the Jamma rises near Ankober and drains northern Shoa; the Muger rises near Addis Ababa and drains south-western Shoa; the Didessa, the largest of the Abay&#x27;s affluents, rises in the Kaffa hills and has a generally south-to-north course; the Dabus runs near the western edge of the plateau escarpment. All these are perennial rivers. The right-hand tributaries, rising mostly on the western sides of the plateau, have steep slopes and are generally torrential in character. The Beles, however, is perennial, and the Rahad and Dinder are important rivers in flood-time.

In the mountains and plateaus of Gambela and Kaffa in southwestern Ethiopia rise the Baro, Gelo, Akobo and other chief affluents of the Sobat tributary of the Nile. The Akobo, in about , joins the Pibor, which in about unites with the Baro, the river below the confluence taking the name of Sobat. These rivers descend from the mountains in great falls, and like the other Ethiopian streams are unnavigable in their upper courses. The Baro on reaching the plain becomes, however, a navigable stream affording an open waterway to the Nile. The Baro, Pibor and Akobo form for the western and southwestern frontiers of Ethiopia.

The chief river of Ethiopia flowing east is the Awash River (or Awasi), which rises in the Shewan uplands and makes a semicircular bend first southeast and then northeast. It reaches the Afar Depression through a broad breach in the eastern escarpment of the plateau, beyond which it is joined on its left bank by its chief affluent, the Germama (Kasam), and then trends round in the direction of the Gulf of Tadjoura. Here the Awash is a copious stream nearly wide and deep, even in the dry season, and during the floods rising above low-water mark, thus inundating the plains for many kilometers along both its banks.

After a winding course of about , the Awash River passes (in its lower reaches) through a series of badds (lagoons) to Lake Abbe (or Abhe Bid) on the border with Djibouti and some from the head of the Gulf of Tadjoura. In this lake the Awash river is lost. This remarkable phenomenon is explained by the position of Lake Abbe in the centre of a saline lacustrine depression several hundred meters below sea level. While most of the other lagoons are highly saline, with thick incrustations of salt round their margins, Lake Abbe remains fresh throughout the year, owing to the great body of water discharged into it by the Awash.

Another lacustrine region extends from the Shoan heights southwest to the Samburu (Lake Turkana) depression. In this chain of scenic upland lakes – some fresh, some brackish, some completely closed, others connected by short channels – the chief links in their order from north to south are: Zway, communicating southwards with Hara and Lamina, all in the Arsi Zone; then Abijatta with an outlet to a smaller turn to the Baroda and Gamo areas, skirted on the west sides by grassy slopes and wooded ranges from to nearly high; lastly, Lake Chew Bahir (formerly known as Lake Stephanie) which is completely closed and falling to a level of about above sea level.

To the same system belongs the neighbouring Lake Turkana, which is larger than all the rest put together. This lake receives at its northern end the waters of the Omo, which rises in the Shoan highlands and is a perennial river with many affluents. In its course of some it has a total fall of about , from at its source to c. at lake level, and is consequently a rapid stream, being broken by the Kokobi and other falls, and navigable only for a short distance above its mouth.

The chief rivers of Somalia, the Shebelle and the Jubba, rise on the southeastern slopes of the Ethiopian escarpment as the Shebelle, the Ganale Doria and the Dawa, and part of their course is through territory belonging to Ethiopia.

There are numerous hot springs in Ethiopia, such as Sodere.

==Geology==
The East African tableland is continued into Ethiopia. A pioneering study of the geology of Ethiopia was W. T. Blanford&#x27;s work in 1870. More recent work has focused on the Afar Depression, due to its importance as one of two places on Earth where a mid-ocean ridge can be studied on land (the other is Iceland).

The following formations are represented:

; Sedimentary and metamorphic
:* Recent: Coral, alluvium, sand
:* Tertiary: Limestones of Harrar
:* Jurassic: Antalo Limestones
:* Triassic: Adigrat Sandstones
:* Archaean: Gneisses, schists, slaty rocks
; Igneous
:* Recent: Aden Volcanic Series
:* Tertiary, Cretaceous: Magdala group
:* Jurassic: Ashangi group
Archaean.– The metamorphic rocks compose the main mass of the tableland, and are exposed in every deep valley in Tigre and along the valley of the Blue Nile. Mica-schists form the prevalent rocks. Hornblende schists also occur and a compact feldspathic rock in the Suris defile. The folia of the schists strike north and south.

Triassic.– In the region of Adigrat the metamorphic rocks are invariably overlain by white and brown sandstones, unfossiliferous, and attaining a maximum thickness of 300 m. They are overlain by the fossiliferous limestones of the Antalo group. Around Chelga and Adigrat coal-bearing beds occur, which Blanford suggests may be of the same age as the coal-bearing strata of India. The Adigrat Sandstone possibly represents some portion of the Karoo System of South Africa.

Jurassic.– The fossiliferous Antalo Limestones are generally horizontal, but are in places much disturbed when interstratified with Mekelle Dolerite. The fossils are all characteristic Oolite forms and include species of Hemicidaris, Pholadomya, Ceromya, Trigonia and Alaria.

Igneous Rocks.– Above a height of the country consists of bedded traps belonging to two distinct and unconformable groups. The lower (Ashangi group) consists of basalts and dolerites often amygdaloidal. Their relation to the Antalo limestones is uncertain, but Blanford considers them to be not later in age than the Oolite. The upper (Magdala group) contains much trachytic rock of considerable thickness, lying perfectly horizontally, and giving rise to a series of terraced ridges characteristic of central Ethiopia. They are interbedded with unfossiliferous sandstones and shales.

Of more recent date (probably Tertiary) are some igneous rocks, rich in alkalis, occurring in certain localities in southern Ethiopia. Of still more recent date are the basalts and ashes west of Massawa and around Annesley Bay and known as the Aden Volcanic Series. With regard to the older igneous rocks, the enormous amount they have suffered from denudation is a prominent feature. They have been worn into deep and narrow ravines, sometimes to a depth of .

==Climate==

The climate of Ethiopia and its dependent territories varies greatly. It is temperate on the plateau and hot in the lowlands. The country lies wholly within the tropics, but its nearness to the equator is counterbalanced by the elevation of the land. At Addis Ababa, which ranges from , maximum temperature is and minimum . The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (&quot;belg&quot;) rains occur from February to April and the large (&quot;meher&quot;) rains from mid-June to mid-September. Over the greater part of Ethiopia as well as the Oromia highlands, the climate is very healthy and temperate. However, in the deep valleys of the Tekezé and Abay, and generally in places below , the conditions are tropical and diseases such as malaria are prevalent. The Somali Region and the Danakil Depression in the Afar Region have a hot, sunny and dry climate producing fully desert or semi-desert conditions. The terrain in the lower basin of the Sobat is hot, swampy and malarious.

In the uplands, the air is cool and bracing in summer, and in winter very bleak. The mean range of temperature is between . On the higher mountains the climate is alpine in character. The atmosphere on the plateaus is exceedingly clear, so that objects are easily recognizable at great distances. In addition to the variation in climate dependent on elevation, the year may be divided into three seasons. Winter, or the cold season, lasts from October to February. It is followed by a dry hot period, which about the middle of June gives place to the rainy season. The rain is heaviest in the Tekezé basin in July and August.

In the former provinces of Gojjam and Welega, heavy rains continue till the middle of September. October is occasionally a wet month. There are also spring and winter rains; indeed rain often falls in every month of the year. But the rainy season proper, caused by the southwest monsoon, lasts from June to mid-September, and commencing in the north moves southward. In the region of the headwaters of the Sobat the rains begin earlier and last longer. The rainfall varies from about a year in Tigray and Amhara to over in parts of Oromia.

The rainy season is of great importance not only to Ethiopia but to the countries of the Nile valley, as the prosperity of the eastern Sudan and Egypt is largely dependent upon the rainfall. A season of light rain may be sufficient for the needs of Ethiopia, but there is little surplus water to find its way to the Nile; and a shortness of rain means a low Nile, as practically all the flood water of that river is derived from the Ethiopian tributaries.



==Flora and fauna==
=== Flora ===
As in a day&#x27;s journey the traveller may pass from tropical to almost Alpine conditions of climate, so great also is the range of the flora and fauna.
In the valleys and lowlands the vegetation is dense, but the general appearance of the plateaus is of a comparatively bare country with trees and bushes thinly scattered over it. The glens and ravines on the hillside are often thickly wooded, and offer a delightful contrast to the open downs.

These conditions are particularly characteristic of the northern regions; in the south the vegetation on the uplands is more luxuriant. Among the many varieties of trees and plants found are the date palm, mimosa, wild olive, giant sycamores, junipers and laurels, the myrrh and other gum trees (gnarled and stunted, these flourish most on the eastern foothills), a magnificent pine (the Natal yellow pine, which resists the attacks of the white ant), the fig, orange, lime, pomegranate, peach, apricot, banana, and other fruit trees; the grape vine (rare), blackberry, and raspberry; the cotton and indigo plants, and occasionally the sugar cane. There are in the south large forests of valuable timber trees; and the coffee plant is indigenous in the Kaffa country, whence it takes its name.

Many kinds of grasses and flowers abound. Large areas are covered by the kosso, a hardy member of the rose family, which grows from high and has abundant pendent red blossoms. The flowers and the leaves of this plant are highly prized for medicinal purposes. The fruit of the hurarina, a tree found almost exclusively in Shoa, yields a black grain highly esteemed as a spice. On the tableland a great variety of cereals and vegetables are cultivated. A fibrous plant, known as the sansevieria, grows in a wild state in the semi-desert regions of the north and south-east.

=== Fauna ===
In addition to the domestic animals enumerated below the fauna is very varied. Elephant can be found in certain low-lying districts, especially in the Sobat valley. The hippopotamus and crocodile inhabit the larger rivers flowing west, but are not found in the Hawash, in which, however, otters of large size are plentiful. Lions abound in the low countries. In central Ethiopia the lion is no longer found except occasionally in the river valleys.

Leopards, both spotted and black, are numerous and often of great size; hyenas are found everywhere and are hardy and fierce; the lynx, African wolf, wild dog and jackal are also common. Boars and badgers are more rarely seen. The giraffe is found in the western districts, the zebra and wild ass frequent the lower plateaus and the rocky hills of the north. There are large herds of buffalo and antelope, and gazelles of many varieties and in great numbers are met with in most parts of the country.

Among the varieties are the greater and lesser kudu (both rather rare); the duiker, gemsbok, hartebeest, gerenuk (the most common—it has long thin legs and a camel-like neck); klipspringer, found on the high plateaus as well as in the lower districts; and the dik-dik, the smallest of the antelopes, its weight rarely exceeding , common in the low countries and the foothills. The African civet is found in many parts of Ethiopia, but chiefly in the Galla regions. Squirrels and hares are numerous, as are several kinds of monkeys, notably the guereza, gelada, guenon and dog-faced baboon. They range from the tropical lowlands to heights of .

Numerous eagles, vultures, hawks, bustards and other birds of prey live in Ethiopia, as well as partridges, guineafowl, sandgrouse, curlews, woodcock, snipe, pigeons, thrushes and swallows are very plentiful. A fine variety of ostrich is commonly found. Among the birds prized for their plumage are the marabou, crane, heron, blackbird, parrot and jays of extraordinary brilliance.

Among insects the most numerous and useful is the bee, honey everywhere constituting an important part of the food of the inhabitants. Of an opposite class is the locust. There are thousands of varieties of butterflies and other insects. Snakes are not numerous, but several species are venomous.

==Natural resources and land use==
Ethiopia has small reserves of gold, platinum, copper, potash, and natural gas. It has extensive hydropower potential.

Of the total land area, about 20 percent is under cultivation, although the amount of potentially arable land is larger. Only about 10 to 15 percent of the land area is presently covered by forest as a result of rapid deforestation during the last 30 years. Of the remainder, a large portion is used as pasturage. Some land is too rugged, dry, or infertile for agriculture or any other use.

==Environmental issues==

==Disputed border==
===Eritrea===

The border between Ethiopia and Eritrea was the subject of multiple conflicts between the countries for awhile. Between 1998 and 2000, the two countries fought a war over the issue, which involves quite small enclaves along the northern segment of their border, including the tiny village of Badme and the enclave of the Irob people. An international boundary commission delimited the border in 2002. Although both nations agreed to accept its decision, Ethiopia has refused to accept the commission&#x27;s findings in full, much to the consternation of the Eritrean government. The conflicts continued sporadically for the next 16 years, ending with the 2018 Eritrea–Ethiopia summit. Ethiopia, going back on their previous policy of not giving up the disputed territories, decided to let go of them in order to end the conflict. 

===Somalia===
The central section of Ethiopia&#x27;s border with Somalia also has never been fully demarcated, and is only provisional. Prior to 1950, the border between Somalia and Ethiopia was characterized by the 1908 Convention Line or Feerfeer-Dharkayn Geenyo Line.

Questions remain about the precise location of small parcels along the border with Sudan as well.

<doc id="62146" wikidata="Q740410" url="?curid=62146" title="French submarine Surcouf">
<text>Surcouf was a large French gun-armed cruiser submarine of the mid 20th century. She carried two 203 mm guns as well as anti-aircraft guns and (for most of her career) a floatplane. &quot;Surcouf&quot; served in the French Navy and, later, the Free French Naval Forces during the Second World War.

&quot;Surcouf&quot; disappeared during the night of 18/19 February 1942 in the Caribbean Sea, possibly after colliding with the US freighter &quot;Thompson Lykes&quot;, although this has not been definitely established. She was named after the French privateer and shipowner Robert Surcouf. She was the largest submarine built until surpassed by the first Japanese I-400 class aircraft carrier submarine in 1944.

==Design==

The Washington Naval Treaty had placed strict limits on naval construction by the major naval powers in regard to displacements and artillery calibers of battleships and cruisers. However, no agreements were reached in respect of light ships such as frigates, destroyers or submarines. In addition, to ensure the country&#x27;s protection and that of the empire, France started the construction of an important submarine fleet (79 units in 1939). &quot;Surcouf&quot; was intended to be the first of a class of three submarine cruisers; however, she was the only one completed.

The missions revolved around:
* Ensuring contact with the French colonies;
* In collaboration with French naval squadrons, searching for and destroying enemy fleets;
* Pursuing enemy convoys.

&quot;Surcouf&quot; had a twin-gun turret with 203 mm (8-inch) guns, the same calibre as the guns of a heavy cruiser, provisioned with 60 rounds. She was designed as an &quot;underwater heavy cruiser&quot;, intended to seek out and engage in surface combat. The boat carried a Besson MB.411 observation floatplane in a hangar built aft of the conning tower for reconnaissance and observing fall of shot.

The boat was equipped with ten torpedo tubes: four tubes in the bow, and two swiveling external launchers in the aft superstructure, each with one 550 mm and two torpedo tubes. Eight 550 mm and four 400 mm reloads were carried. The 203  Modèle 1924 guns were in a pressure-tight turret forward of the conning tower. The guns had a 60-round magazine capacity and were controlled by a director with a rangefinder, mounted high enough to view an horizon, and able to fire within three minutes after surfacing. Using the boat&#x27;s periscopes to direct the fire of the main guns, &quot;Surcouf&quot; could increase the visible range to ; originally an elevating platform was supposed to lift lookouts high, but this design was abandoned quickly due to the effect of roll. 
The Besson observation plane could be used to direct fire out to the guns&#x27; maximum range. Anti-aircraft cannon and machine guns were mounted on the top of the hangar.

&quot;Surcouf&quot; also carried a motorboat, and contained a cargo compartment with fittings to restrain 40 prisoners or lodge 40 passengers. The submarine&#x27;s fuel tanks were very large; having enough fuel for a range and supplies for 90-day patrols.

The test depth was .

The first commanding officer was Frigate Captain (&quot;Capitaine de Frégate&quot;, a rank equivalent to Commander) Raymond de Belot.

The boat encountered several technical challenges:
* Because of the low height of the rangefinder above the water surface, the practical range of fire was with the rangefinder, increased to with sighting aided by periscope, well below the guns&#x27; maximum range of .
* The duration between the surface order and the first firing round was 3 minutes and 35 seconds. This duration would be longer if the boat was to fire broadside, which meant surfacing and training the turret in the desired direction. 
* Firing had to occur at a precise moment of pitch and roll when the ship was level.
* Training the turret to either side was impossible when the ship rolled 8° or more. 
* &quot;Surcouf&quot; could not fire accurately at night, as fall of shot could not be observed in the dark.
* The guns&#x27; ready magazines had to be reloaded after firing 14 rounds from each gun.

To replace the floatplane, whose functioning was initially constrained and limited in use, trials were conducted with an autogyro in 1938.

==Appearance ==

&#x27;From the beginning of the boat&#x27;s career until 1932, the boat was painted the same grey colour as surface warships, but thereafter in &quot;Prussian dark blue&quot;, a colour which was retained until the end of 1940 when it was repainted with two tones of grey, serving as camouflage on the hull and conning tower.

== Career==

===Early career===

Soon after &quot;Surcouf&quot; was launched, the London Naval Treaty finally placed restrictions on submarine designs. Among other things, each signatory (France included) was permitted to possess no more than three large submarines, each not exceeding standard displacement, with guns not exceeding in caliber. &quot;Surcouf&quot;, which would have exceeded these limits, was specially exempt from the rules at the insistence of Navy Minister Georges Leygues, but other &#x27;big-gun&#x27; submarines of this boat&#x27;s class could no longer be built.

===Second World War===
In 1940, &quot;Surcouf&quot; was based in Cherbourg, but in May, when the Germans invaded, she was being refitted in Brest following a mission in the Antilles and Gulf of Guinea. Under command of Frigate Captain Martin, unable to dive and with only one engine functioning and a jammed rudder, she limped across the English Channel and sought refuge in Plymouth.

On 3 July, the British, concerned that the French Fleet would be taken over by the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; at the French armistice, executed Operation Catapult. The Royal Navy blockaded the harbours where French warships were anchored, and delivered an ultimatum: rejoin the fight against Germany, be put out of reach of the Germans, or scuttle. Few accepted willingly; the North African fleet at Mers-el-Kebir and the ships based at Dakar (French West Africa) refused. The French battleships in North Africa were eventually attacked and all but one sunk at their moorings by the Mediterranean Fleet.

French ships lying at ports in Britain and Canada were also boarded by armed marines, sailors and soldiers, but the only serious incident took place at Plymouth aboard &quot;Surcouf&quot; on 3 July, when two Royal Navy submarine officers, Commander Denis &#x27;Lofty&#x27; Sprague, captain of , and Lieutenant Patrick Griffiths of , and French warrant officer mechanic Yves Daniel were fatally wounded, and a British seaman, Albert Webb, was shot dead by the submarine&#x27;s doctor.

===Free French Naval Forces===
By August 1940, the British completed &quot;Surcouf&quot;″s refit and turned her over to the Free French Naval Forces (&quot;Forces Navales Françaises Libres&quot;, FNFL) for convoy patrol. The only officer not repatriated from the original crew, Frigate Captain Georges Louis Blaison, became the new commanding officer. Because of Anglo-French tensions with regard to the submarine, accusations were made by each side that the other was spying for Vichy France; the British also claimed &quot;Surcouf&quot; was attacking British ships. Later, a British officer and two sailors were put aboard for &quot;liaison&quot; purposes. One real drawback was she required a crew of 110–130 men, which represented three crews of more conventional submarines. This led to Royal Navy reluctance to recommission her.

&quot;Surcouf&quot; then went to the Canadian base at Halifax, Nova Scotia and escorted trans-Atlantic convoys. In April 1941, she was damaged by a German plane at Devonport.

On 28 July, &quot;Surcouf&quot; went to the United States Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine for a three-month refit.

After leaving the shipyard, &quot;Surcouf&quot; went to New London, Connecticut, perhaps to receive additional training for her crew. &quot;Surcouf&quot; left New London on 27 November to return to Halifax.

===Capture of St. Pierre and Miquelon===
In December 1941, &quot;Surcouf&quot; carried the Free French Admiral Émile Muselier to Canada, putting into Quebec City. While the Admiral was in Ottawa, conferring with the Canadian government, &quot;Surcouf&quot;″s captain was approached by &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Ira Wolfert and questioned about the rumours the submarine would liberate Saint-Pierre and Miquelon for Free France. Wolfert accompanied the submarine to Halifax, where, on 20 December, they joined Free French &quot;Escorteurs&quot; corvettes &quot;Mimosa&quot;, , and , and on 24 December, took control of the islands for Free France without resistance.

United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull had just concluded an agreement with the Vichy government guaranteeing the neutrality of French possessions in the Western hemisphere, and he threatened to resign unless President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt demanded a restoration of the status quo. Roosevelt did so, but when Charles de Gaulle refused, Roosevelt dropped the matter. Ira Wolfert&#x27;s stories – very favourable to the Free French (and bearing no sign of kidnapping or other duress) – helped swing American popular opinion away from Vichy. The Axis Powers&#x27; declaration of war on the United States in December 1941 negated the agreement, but the U.S. did not sever diplomatic ties with the Vichy Government until November 1942.

===Later operations===
In January 1942, the Free French leadership decided to send &quot;Surcouf&quot; to the Pacific theatre, after she had been re-supplied at the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda. However, her movement south triggered rumours that &quot;Surcouf&quot; was going to liberate Martinique from the Vichy regime.

In fact, &quot;Surcouf&quot; was bound for Sydney, Australia, via Tahiti. She departed Halifax on 2 February for Bermuda, which she left on 12 February, bound for the Panama Canal.

===Fate===

&quot;Surcouf&quot; vanished on the night of 18/19 February 1942, about north of Cristóbal, Panama, while &quot;en route&quot; for Tahiti, &quot;via&quot; the Panama Canal. An American report concluded the disappearance was due to an accidental collision with the American freighter . Steaming alone from Guantanamo Bay on what was a very dark night, the freighter reported hitting and running down a partially submerged object which scraped along her side and keel. Her lookouts heard people in the water but, thinking she had hit a U-boat, the freighter did not stop although cries for help were heard in English. A signal was sent to Panama describing the incident.

The loss resulted in 130 deaths (including 4 Royal Navy personnel), under the command of Frigate Captain Georges Louis Nicolas Blaison. The loss of &quot;Surcouf&quot; was announced by the Free French Headquarters in London on 18 April 1942, and was reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; the next day. It was not reported &quot;Surcouf&quot; was sunk as the result of a collision with the &quot;Thompson Lykes&quot; until January 1945.

The investigation of the French commission concluded the disappearance was the consequence of misunderstanding. A Consolidated PBY, patrolling the same waters on the night of 18/19 February, could have attacked &quot;Surcouf&quot; believing her to be German or Japanese. 

Inquiries into the incident were haphazard and late, while a later French inquiry supported the idea that the sinking had been due to &quot;friendly fire&quot;; this conclusion was supported by Rear Admiral Gabriel Auphan in his book &quot;The French Navy in World War II&quot;. Charles de Gaulle stated in his memoirs that &quot;Surcouf&quot; &quot;had sunk with all hands&quot;.

===Legacy===

As no one has officially dived or verified the wreck of &quot;Surcouf&quot;, her location is unknown. If one assumes the &quot;Thompson Lykes&quot; incident was indeed the event of &quot;Surcouf&#x27;s&quot; sinking, then the wreck would lie deep at .

A monument commemorates the loss in the port of Cherbourg in Normandy, France. The loss is also commemorated by the Free French Memorial on Lyle Hill in Greenock, Scotland.
As there is no conclusive confirmation that &quot;Thompson Lykes&quot; collided with &quot;Surcouf&quot;, and her wreck has yet to be discovered, there are alternative stories of her fate. James Rusbridger examined some of these theories in his book &quot;Who Sank Surcouf?&quot;, finding them all easily dismissible except one: the records of the 6th Heavy Bomber Group operating out of Panama show them sinking a large submarine the morning of 19 February. Since no German submarine was lost in the area on that date, she could have been &quot;Surcouf&quot;. He suggested the collision had damaged &quot;Surcouf&quot;″s radio and the stricken boat limped towards Panama hoping for the best.

A conspiracy theory, based on no significant evidence, held that the &quot;Surcouf&quot;, during her stationing at New London in late 1941, had been caught treacherously supplying a German U-boat in Long Island Sound, pursued by the American training subs &quot;Marlin&quot; and &quot;Mackerel&quot; out of New London, and sunk. The rumor circulated into the early 21st century, but is false since the &quot;Surcouf&quot;″s later movements south are well documented.

===In popular media===
The &quot;Surcouf&quot; is the subject of an underwater search by the fictional organization &quot;NUMA&quot; and international terrorists in the Clive Cussler novel &quot;The Corsican Shadow&quot;, published in 2023. Cussler and his co-writer, Dirk Cussler, writes the &quot;Surcouf&quot;″s wreck was discovered &quot;...some eighty miles off the Panama coast.&quot; The sinking is even attributed to &quot;Surcouf&quot;″s radio antenna being damaged in the collision with the &quot;Thompson Lykes&quot;, and then finished off by the reported attack of an A-17 bomber the next morning.

<doc id="62147" wikidata="Q2703616" url="?curid=62147" title="French frigate Surcouf">
<text>Surcouf (F711) is a of the French Navy. Construction began at Lorient Naval Dockyard on 6 July 1992, launched 3 July 1993, and the ship was commissioned May 1996. Since entering service, &quot;Surcouf&quot; has taken part in numerous missions, notably in Operation Antilope (Gabon and Congo), Operation Trident (Kosovo) and Mission Khor Anga in the Djibouti zone.

==Service history==
On 14 May 2001, &quot;Surcouf&quot; rendered assistance to the skipper of &quot;Biscuits La Trinitaine-Team Ethypharm&quot;, who had to abandon his ship after her starboard hull was seriously damaged. The catamaran&#x27;s crew of five were airlifted to safety by helicopter.

On 14 October 2004, &quot;Surcouf&quot; assisted &quot;Sara 2&quot;, a Panamanian cargo ship which ran aground near Yemen. The 16-man crew was successfully airlifted by the Panther helicopter, and later transferred from the frigate to the Yemeni coast guard.

Between 17 and 21 May 2008, &quot;Surcouf &quot; participated in Exercise KhunjarHaad, a multi-national exercise held in the Gulf of Oman. Other participating warships included the American destroyer , the British frigate , the British fleet replenishment tanker and four other coalition ships conducted air defense; surface warfare operation; visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS); and joint gunnery exercises, which focused on joint interoperability training and proficiency.

In November 2012 &quot;Surcouf&quot; deployed to the Horn of Africa as part of the European Union&#x27;s Naval Operation in the area. A British Lynx HMA.8 helicopter of 815 Squadron was on board for the whole four-month deployment, along with 12 personnel including 2 Royal Marine snipers. This was the first extended deployment of a Royal Navy helicopter on a French warship and was the result of a treaty between the United Kingdom and France to share military resources and conduct more joint operations. 

During a 2017–18 refit, the frigate was equipped with a Thales Bluewatcher sonar as part of a two-year trial that was subsequently extended through 2022. &quot;Surcouf&quot; was the first &quot;La Fayette&quot;-class ship to receive an active sonar capability.

In 2021, &quot;Surcouf&quot; deployed to the Pacific accompanying the French Navy helicopter assault ship .

In April 2022, &quot;Surcouf&quot;, with a Panther helicopter embarked, again deployed to the Indian Ocean to relieve her sister ship . From 26 until 30 May 2022, &quot;Surcouf&quot; trained with the Kuwait Naval Force.

In October 2023 &quot;Surcouf&quot; was deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, joining the helicopter assault ship &quot;Tonnerre&quot; and the frigate which were also deployed to the region.

&quot;Surcouf&quot; had been scheduled to undergo a modest structural and technical upgrade (with the elderly Crotale SAM to be removed from the vessel) and, given somewhat reduced general purpose capability, be re-assigned to offshore patrol duties prior to her planned withdrawal from service in 2027. However, subsequently it was decided to retain the ship in the frigate role despite her not having received a mid-life upgrade.

<doc id="62149" wikidata="Q625825" url="?curid=62149" title="Custard">
<text>Custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on sweetened milk, cheese, or cream cooked with egg or egg yolk to thicken it, and sometimes also flour, corn starch, or gelatin. Depending on the recipe, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce () to the thick pastry cream () used to fill éclairs. The most common custards are used in custard desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla; however, savory custards are also found, e.g., in quiche.

==Preparation==
Custard is usually cooked in a double boiler (&quot;bain-marie&quot;), or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove, though custard can also be steamed, baked in the oven with or without a water bath, or even cooked in a pressure cooker. Custard preparation is a delicate operation because a &quot;temperature&quot; increase of leads to overcooking and curdling. Generally, a fully cooked custard should not exceed ; it begins setting at . A bain marie water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles. Adding a small amount of cornflour (U.S. &quot;corn starch&quot;) to the egg-sugar mixture stabilises the resulting custard, allowing it to be cooked in a single pan as well as in a double-boiler. A &quot;sous-vide&quot; water bath may be used to precisely control temperature.

== Variations ==

While custard may refer to a wide variety of thickened dishes, technically (and in French cookery) the word &quot;custard&quot; (&quot;crème&quot; or more precisely &quot;crème moulée&quot;, ) refers only to an egg-thickened custard.

When starch is added, the result is called &#x27;pastry cream&#x27; (, ) or confectioners&#x27; custard, made with a combination of milk or cream, egg yolks, fine sugar, flour or some other starch, and usually a flavoring such as vanilla, chocolate, or lemon. &quot;Crème pâtissière&quot; is a key ingredient in many French desserts, including &quot;mille-feuille&quot; (or Napoleons) and filled tarts. It is also used in Italian pastry and sometimes in Boston cream pie. The thickening of the custard is caused by the combination of egg and starch. Corn flour or flour thickens at and as such many recipes instruct the pastry cream to be boiled. In a traditional custard such as a &quot;crème anglaise&quot;, where eggs are used alone as a thickener, boiling results in the over-cooking and subsequent curdling of the custard; however, in a pastry cream, starch prevents this. Once cooled, the amount of starch in pastry cream sets the cream and requires it to be beaten or whipped before use.
When gelatin is added, it is known as &quot;crème anglaise collée&quot; (). When gelatin is added and whipped cream is folded in, and it sets in a mold, it is &quot;bavarois&quot;. When starch is used alone as a thickener (without eggs), the result is a &quot;blancmange&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, custard has various traditional recipes some thickened principally with cornflour (cornstarch) rather than the egg component, others involving regular flour; see custard powder.

After the custard has thickened, it may be mixed with other ingredients: mixed with stiffly beaten egg whites and gelatin, it is chiboust cream; mixed with whipped cream, it is &quot;crème légère&quot;, . Beating in softened butter produces German buttercream or crème mousseline.

A quiche is a savoury custard tart. Some kinds of timbale or vegetable loaf are made of a custard base mixed with chopped savoury ingredients. &quot;Custard royale&quot; is a thick custard cut into decorative shapes and used to garnish soup, stew or broth. In German, it is known as &quot;Eierstich&quot; and is used as a garnish in German Wedding Soup (&quot;Hochzeitssuppe&quot;). &quot;Chawanmushi&quot; is a Japanese savoury custard, steamed and served in a small bowl or on a saucer. Chinese steamed egg is a similar but larger savoury egg dish. &quot;Bougatsa&quot; is a Greek breakfast pastry whose sweet version consists of semolina custard filling between layers of phyllo.

Custard may also be used as a top layer in gratins, such as the South African bobotie and many Balkan versions of &quot;moussaka&quot;.

In Peru, &quot;leche asada&quot; (&quot;baked milk&quot;) is custard baked in individual molds. It is considered a restaurant dish.

=== In French cuisine ===
French cuisine has several named variations on custard:
* &quot;Crème anglaise&quot; is a light custard made with eggs, sugar, milk, and vanilla (with the possible addition of starch), with other flavoring agents as desired
** With cream instead of milk, and more sugar, it is the basis of &quot;crème brûlée&quot;
** With egg yolks and heavy cream, it is the basis of ice cream
** With egg yolks and whipped cream, and stabilised with gelatin, it is the basis of Bavarian cream
** Thickened with butter, chocolate, or gelatin, it is a popular basis for a &quot;crémeux&quot;
* &quot;Crème pâtissière&quot; (pastry cream) is similar to &quot;crème anglaise&quot;, but with a thickening agent such as cornstach or flour
** With added flavoring or fresh fruit, it is the basis of &quot;crème plombières&quot;
* &quot;Crème Saint-Honoré&quot; is &quot;crème pâtissière&quot; enriched with whipped egg whites
* &quot;Crème chiboust&quot; is similar to &quot;crème Saint-Honoré&quot;, but stabilised with gelatin

* &quot;Crème diplomate&quot; and &quot;crème légère&quot; are variations of &quot;crème pâtissière&quot; enriched with whipped cream
* &quot;Crème mousseline&quot; is a variation of &quot;crème pâtissière&quot; enriched with butter
* &quot;Frangipane&quot; is &quot;crème pâtissière&quot; mixed with powdered macarons or almond powder

== History ==
Custards baked in pastry (custard tarts) were very popular in the Middle Ages, and are the origin of the English word &#x27;custard&#x27;: the French term croustade originally referred to the crust of a tart, and is derived from the Italian word crostata, and ultimately the Latin .

Examples include &quot;Crustardes of flessh&quot; and &quot;Crustade&quot;, in the 14th century English collection &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot;. These recipes include solid ingredients such as meat, fish, and fruit bound by the custard. Stirred custards cooked in pots are also found under the names &quot;Creme Boylede&quot; and &quot;Creme boiled&quot;. Some custards especially in the Elizabethan era used marigold (&quot;calendula&quot;) to give the custard color.

In modern times, the name &#x27;custard&#x27; is sometimes applied to starch-thickened preparations like blancmange and Bird&#x27;s Custard powder.

== Chemistry ==
Stirred custard is thickened by coagulation of egg protein, while the same gives baked custard its gel structure. The type of milk used also impacts the result. Most important to a successfully stirred custard is to avoid excessive heat that will cause over-coagulation and syneresis that will result in a curdled custard.

Eggs contain the proteins necessary for the gel structure to form, and emulsifiers to maintain the structure. Egg yolk also contains enzymes like amylase, which can break down added starch. This enzyme activity contributes to the overall thinning of custard in the mouth. Egg yolk lecithin also helps to maintain the milk-egg interface. The proteins in egg whites are set at .

Starch is sometimes added to custard to prevent premature curdling. The starch acts as a heat buffer in the mixture: as they hydrate, they absorb heat and help maintain a constant rate of heat transfer. Starches also make for a smoother texture and thicker mouth feel.

If the mixture pH is 9 or higher, the gel is too hard; if it is below 5, the gel structure has difficulty forming because protonation prevents the formation of covalent bonds.

== Physical-chemical properties ==
Cooked (set) custard is a weak gel, viscous, and thixotropic; while it does become easier to stir the more it is manipulated, it does not, unlike many other thixotropic liquids, recover its lost viscosity over time. On the other hand, a suspension of uncooked imitation custard powder (starch) in water, with the proper proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, allowing the demonstration of &quot;walking on custard&quot;.

<doc id="62153" wikidata="Q229385" url="?curid=62153" title="Soy sauce">
<text>Soy sauce (sometimes called soya sauce in British English) is a liquid condiment of Chinese origin, traditionally made from a fermented paste of soybeans, roasted grain, brine, and &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot; or &quot;Aspergillus sojae&quot; molds. It is recognized for its saltiness and pronounced umami taste.

Soy sauce was created in its current form about 2,200 years ago during the Western Han dynasty of ancient China. Since then, it has become an important ingredient in East and Southeast Asian cooking as well as a condiment worldwide.

== Use and storage ==
Soy sauce can be added directly to food, and is used as a dip or salt flavor in cooking. It is often eaten with rice, noodles, and sushi or sashimi, or can also be mixed with ground wasabi for dipping. Bottles of soy sauce for the salty seasoning of various foods are common on restaurant tables in many countries. Soy sauce can be stored at room temperature.

== History ==
=== Asia ===
==== China ====
Soy sauce (, ) is considered almost as old as soy paste—a type of fermented paste (, ) obtained from soybeans—which had appeared during the Western Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) and was listed in the bamboo slips found in the archaeological site Mawangdui (). There are several precursors of soy sauce that are associated products with soy paste. The oldest is (), which appeared in AD 40 and was listed in (). Others are (), () and (), which were recorded in the () in AD 540. By the time of the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD), the term &quot;soy sauce&quot; () had become the accepted name for the liquid condiment, documented in two books: () and &quot;Pujiang Wushi Zhongkuilu&quot; () during the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD).

Like many salty condiments, soy sauce was originally a way to stretch salt, historically an expensive commodity. During the Zhou dynasty of ancient China, fermented fish with salt was used as a condiment in which soybeans were included during the fermentation process. By the time of the Han dynasty, this had been replaced with the recipe for soy paste and its by-product soy sauce, by using soybeans as the principal ingredient, with fermented fish-based sauces developing separately into fish sauce.

The 19th century Sinologist Samuel Wells Williams wrote that in China, the best soy sauce was &quot;made by boiling beans soft, adding an equal quantity of wheat or barley, and leaving the mass to ferment; a portion of salt and three times as much water are afterwards put in, and the whole compound left for two or three months when the liquid is pressed and strained&quot;.

====Japan====
A condiment that predated soy sauce in Japan was , a fish sauce. When practitioners of Buddhism came to Japan from China in the 7th century, they introduced vegetarianism and brought many soy-based products with them, such as soy sauce, which is known as in Japan. exportation began in 1647 by the Dutch East India Company.

==== Korea ====
The earliest soy sauce brewing in Korea seems to have begun in the era of the Three Kingdoms The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, a Chinese historical text written and published in the 3rd century, mentions that &quot;Goguryeo people are good at brewing and fermenting&quot; in the section named (Eastern foreigners) in the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;. Jangdoks used for soy sauce brewing are found in the mural paintings of Anak Tomb No. 3 from the 4th century Goguryeo.

In , a historical record of the Three Kingdoms era, it is written that (soy sauce) and (soybean paste), along with (soybean block) and (salted seafood), were prepared for the wedding ceremony of the King Sinmun in February 683. , a section from (History of Goryeo), recorded that and were included in the relief supplies in 1018, after a Khitan invasion, and in 1052, when a famine occurred. Joseon texts such as and contain the detailed procedures on how to brew good quality and . explains how to pick a date for brewing, what to forbear, and how to keep and preserve and .

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, soy sauce was likely first recorded through the documentation of the traditional dish adobo in 1613 via the San Buenaventura paper. Food historian Raymond Sokolov noted that the ingredients used in the dish, including soy sauce, likely were present in the native cuisine even before the colonial-era record.

=== Europe ===
Records of the Dutch East India Company list soy sauce as a commodity in 1737, when seventy-five large barrels were shipped from Dejima, Japan, to Batavia (present-day Jakarta) on the island of Java. Thirty-five barrels from that shipment were then shipped to the Netherlands. In the 18th century, diplomat and scholar Isaac Titsingh published accounts of brewing soy sauce. Although earlier descriptions of soy sauce had been disseminated in the West, his was among the earliest to focus specifically on the brewing of the Japanese version. By the mid-19th century, Japanese soy sauce gradually disappeared from the European market, and the condiment became synonymous with the Chinese product. Europeans were unable to make soy sauce because they did not have access to &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;, the fungus used in its brewing. Soy sauce made from ingredients such as portobello mushrooms were disseminated in European cookbooks during the late 18th century. A Swedish recipe for was published in the 1770 edition of Cajsa Warg&#x27;s and was flavored with allspice and mace.

=== United States ===
Soy sauce production in the United States began in the Territory of Hawaii in 1905 by Yamajo Soy Co, which by 1909 was renamed the Hawaiian Soy Company Ltd. La Choy started selling hydrolyzed vegetable protein–based soy sauce in 1933.

== Production ==

Soy sauce is made either by fermentation or by hydrolysis. Some commercial sauces have both fermented and chemical sauces.

Flavor, color, and aroma developments during production are attributed to non-enzymatic Maillard browning.

Variation is usually achieved as the result of different methods and durations of fermentation, different ratios of water, salt, and fermented soy, or through the addition of other ingredients.

=== Traditional ===
Traditional soy sauces are made by mixing soybeans and grain with mold cultures such as &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot; and other related microorganisms and yeasts (the resulting mixture is called Koji in Japan; the term is used both for the mixture of soybeans, wheat, and mold as well as for the mold itself). Historically, the mixture was fermented naturally in large urns and under the sun, which was believed to contribute extra flavors. Today, the mixture is placed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled incubation chamber.

Traditional soy sauces take months to make:
# Soaking and cooking: The soybeans are soaked in water and boiled until cooked. Wheat is roasted and crushed.
# culturing: Equal amounts of boiled soybeans and roasted wheat are mixed to form a grain mixture. A culture of Aspergillus spore is added to the grain mixture and mixed, or the mixture is allowed to gather spores from the environment itself. The cultures include:
#* &quot;Aspergillus&quot;: a genus of fungus that is used for fermenting various ingredients (the cultures are called in Japanese). Three species are used for brewing soy sauce:
#** &quot;A. oryzae&quot;: Strains with high proteolytic capacity are used for brewing soy sauce.
#** &quot;A. sojae&quot;: This fungus also has a high proteolytic capacity.
#** &quot;A. tamarii&quot;: This fungus is used for brewing , a variety of soy sauce.
#* &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;: the yeasts in the culture convert some of the sugars to ethanol which can undergo secondary reactions to make other flavor compounds
#* Other microbes contained in the culture:
#** &quot;Bacillus spp&quot;. (genus): This organism is likely to grow in soy sauce ingredients, and to generate odors and ammonia.
#** &quot;Lactobacillus species&quot;: This organism makes a lactic acid that increases the acidity in the feed.
# Brewing: The cultured grain mixture is mixed into a specific amount of salt brine for wet fermentation or with coarse salt for dry fermentation and left to brew. Over time, the Aspergillus mold on the soy and wheat break down the grain proteins into free amino acid and protein fragments and starches into simple sugars. This amino-glycosidic reaction gives soy sauce its dark brown color. Lactic acid bacteria ferments the sugars into lactic acid and yeast makes ethanol, which through aging and secondary fermentation makes numerous flavor compounds typical of soy sauce.
# Pressing: The fully fermented grain slurry is placed into cloth-lined containers and pressed to separate the solids from the liquid soy sauce. The isolated solids are used as fertilizer or fed to animals while the liquid soy sauce is processed further.
# Pasteurization: The raw soy sauce is heated to eliminate any active yeasts and molds remaining in the soy sauce and can be filtered to remove any fine particulates.
# Storage: The soy sauce can be aged or directly bottled and sold.

=== High-salt liquid-state fermented soy sauce ===
High-salt liquid-state fermentation (HLF) of soybeans depends heavily on microbial activity, metabolism and enzymatic hydrolysis of macronutrients. Most traditional approaches fall into the scope of HLF.

*During HLF, -infused soybeans are exposed to air so that hydrolytic enzymes of the mold can continuously break down macronutrients within the soybean.
*Ample water, usually about 2 to 2.5 times the weight of the feed, is required to support sufficient microbial growth.
*High salt concentration (17–20%) is required to selectively inhibit microbial activity.
* HLF is generally carried out at , and requires a long ageing period, usually from 90 to 180 days. In the aging period, constant stirring of (a mash/mixture of wheat (optionally), salt, soy beans, water, and fermenting yeast) is required for distributing nutrients, as well as flavoring compounds evenly. In some cases, moromi is exposed to direct sunlight to facilitate the decomposition of macronutrients.
*Due to the high salinity of HLF moromi, only anaerobic halophiles can survive in the medium. Also, the temperature range allows only the growth of mesophiles. Similar to the fermentation of pickles, the primary lactic acid fermentation of sugars by halophiles reduces the pH of moromi down to acidic range. Low pH further limits the growth of undesirable microbes, but favors the growth of fermentative yeast which contributes to secondary fermentation that generates various flavoring compounds and odorants.

=== Low-salt solid-state fermented soy sauce===
LSF, also referred as rapid fermenting, is a modern fermentation method invented in response to high market demand.

*Compared to HLF, LSF employs pure cultures at a relatively higher temperature () and lower brine solution concentrations (13–15%). In LSF, koji is mixed with the equivalent weight of brine to form solid moromi.
*The elevated temperature accelerates the fermentation process significantly. Due to the short aging (15–30 days) period of LSF, and low production cost, LSF soy sauce accounts for more share of the Chinese soy sauce market.

LSF evolved from &quot;salt-free solid-state fermentation&quot;, an even faster method working at even higher temperatures () and taking 72 hours to complete, introduced to China from the Soviet Union in 1958. The aging time turned out to be too short develop a proper flavor profile, with burnt acidic notes left in the sauce. LSF is a compromise between this method and the more traditional HLF: the product tastes passable with more microbes allowed to survive, but still lacks depth. Reducing the salt content accelerates brewing by lifting salt-induced enzyme inhibition.

=== Acid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein ===

Some brands of soy sauce are made from acid-hydrolyzed soy protein instead of brewed with a traditional culture. This takes about three days. Although they have a different flavor, aroma, and texture when compared to brewed soy sauces, they can be produced more quickly and cheaply, and also have a longer shelf life and are usually made for these reasons. The clear plastic packets of dark sauce common with Chinese-style take-out food typically use a hydrolyzed vegetable protein formula. Some higher-priced hydrolyzed vegetable protein products with no added sugar or colorings are sold as low-sodium soy sauce alternatives called &quot;liquid aminos&quot; in health food stores, similar to the way salt substitutes are used. These products are, however, not necessarily low in sodium.

== Chemical composition ==
The chemical composition of soy sauce is affected by the proportions of raw materials, fermentation methodologies, fermenting molds and strains, and post-fermentation treatments. Although the formation mechanism of chemical composition in soy sauce is complex, it has been widely accepted that free amino acids, water-soluble peptides and Maillard reaction products in soy sauce are considered as essential chemical composition and to provide core sensory effects.
The primary fermentation of lactic-acid-fermenting halophiles lowers the pH of the moromi, and this directly results in the acidic pH range (4.4–5.4) of soy sauce products. The secondary fermentation conducted by heterofermentative microbes provides soy sauce with a wide range of flavor and odorant compounds by breaking down macronutrients. Soy proteins and grain proteins are hydrolyzed into short peptide chains and free amino acids, which adds umami to the product. Based on the result of free amino acid analysis, the most abundant amino acids in Chinese soy sauce product are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine and leucine.

Starch is hydrolyzed into simple sugars which contribute to the sweet flavor in soy sauce. Legume fats may also be decomposed into short chain fatty acids, and the interactions among lipids and other macronutrients also result in a richer flavor in the final product. Non-enzymatic browning also contributes significantly to the development of the properties of soy sauce. The hydrolysis of proteins and large carbohydrates also provides free amino acids and simple sugars as reagents for the Maillard reaction.

Soy sauce may contain more than 1% alcohol and may run afoul of liquor control legislation.

== Sensory profile ==

The taste of soy sauce is predominated by saltiness, followed by moderate umami, sweetness, and finally slight bitterness, which is hard to perceive due to the masking effect of other tastes. The overall flavor of soy sauce is a result of the balance and interaction among different taste components. The saltiness is largely attributed to the presence of NaCl (common salt) in brine. The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids, mainly glutamine and aspartic acid. Sodium from the brine and disodium ribonucleotides from the soy also add to the umami. Other amino acids cause additional basic flavors, with sweet coming from Ala, Gly, Ser, and Thr; bitter coming from Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, and Val; and no taste from Cys, Lys, and Pro. The amino-acid nitrogen content, an indication of the free amino acid concentration, is used in China for grading soy sauce. The highest &quot;special grade&quot; is defined at ≥ 0.8 g/100 mL.

Despite a large variety of volatile and odorant compounds that have been identified in soy sauce, the food product &quot;per se&quot; does not present a strong aroma. Alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, heterocyclic compounds, alkynes and benzenes have been identified in Chinese soy sauces. An explanation for this observation is that the aroma of soy sauce does not depend largely on the aroma-active compounds. The subtle aroma is a result of a &quot;critical balance&quot; achieved among all volatile and odorant compounds, whose respective concentrations are relatively low.

== Variations by country ==
Soy sauce is widely used as an important flavoring and has been integrated into the traditional cuisines of many East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. Despite their rather similar appearance, soy sauces made in different cultures and regions are different in taste, consistency, fragrance and saltiness. Soy sauce retains its quality longer when kept away from direct sunlight.

=== Burmese ===
Burmese soy sauce production is dated back to the Bagan Era in the 9th and 10th century. Scripts written in praise of &quot;pe ngan byar yay&quot; (, literally &quot;bean fish sauce&quot;) were found. Thick soy sauce is called &quot;kya nyo&quot; (, from Chinese &quot;jiàngyóu&quot;).

=== Chinese ===
Chinese soy sauces (; or alternatively, ; ) are primarily made from soybeans, with relatively low amounts of other grains. Chinese soy sauce produced by fermentation can be roughly split into two classes: brewed (direct fermented) or blended (with additives), occupying about 40% and 60% of market share respectively. Sauces can also be classed by fermentation technology (shown above) into Low-Salt Solid-State fermented soy sauce (LSF; ) and High-Salt Liquid-State fermented soy sauce (HLF; ), occupying about 90% and 10% of market share respectively.
==== Brewed ====
Soy sauce can be brewed directly from a fermentation process using wheat, soybeans, salt, and water without additional additives.

* Light or fresh (; or ; ): is a thin (low viscosity), opaque, lighter brown soy sauce, brewed by first culturing steamed wheat and soybeans with &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, and then letting the mixture ferment in brine. It is the main soy sauce used for seasoning, since it is saltier, has less noticeable color, and also adds a distinct flavor.
** &quot;Tóu chōu&quot; (): A light soy sauce made from the first pressing of the soybeans, this can be loosely translated as &quot;first soy sauce&quot; or referred to as premium light soy sauce. &quot;Tóu chōu&quot; is sold at a premium because, like extra virgin olive oil, the flavor of the first pressing is considered superior. Due to its delicate flavor it is used primarily for seasoning light dishes and for dipping.
** &quot;Shuāng huáng&quot; (): A light soy sauce that is double-fermented by using the light soy sauce from another batch to take the place of brine for a second brewing. This adds further complexity to the flavor of the light soy sauce. Due to its complex flavor this soy sauce is used primarily for dipping.
* Yìn yóu (): A darker soy sauce brewed primarily in Taiwan by culturing only steamed soybeans with &quot;Aspergillus&quot; and mixing the cultured soybeans with coarse rock salt before undergoing prolonged dry fermentation. The flavor of this soy sauce is complex and rich and is used for dipping or in red cooking. For the former use, yìn yóu can be thickened with starch to make a thick soy sauce.

==== Blended ====
Additives with sweet or umami tastes are sometimes added to a finished brewed soy sauce to modify its taste and texture.

* Dark and old soy sauce (; ), a darker and slightly thicker soy sauce made from light soy sauce. This soy sauce is made through prolonged aging and may contain added caramel color and/or molasses to give it its distinctive appearance. It has a richer, slightly sweeter, and less salty flavor than light soy sauce. This variety is mainly used during cooking, since its flavor develops during heating. Dark soy sauce is mainly used to add color and flavor to a dish after cooking. One of the strongest varieties is known as &quot;double black&quot; (双老头抽)
** &quot;Mushroom dark soy&quot; ( &quot;cǎogū lǎochōu&quot;): In the finishing and aging process of making dark soy sauce, the broth of &quot;Volvariella volvacea&quot; (straw mushroom) is mixed into the soy sauce and is then exposed to the sun to make this type of dark soy. The added broth gives this soy sauce a richer flavor than plain dark soy sauce.
** &quot;Thick soy sauce&quot; ( &quot;jiàng yóu gāo&quot;), is a dark soy sauce that has been thickened with heat and sugar, occasionally a starch thickener and MSG are used. This sauce is often used as a dipping sauce or finishing sauce and poured on food as a flavorful addition. However, due to its sweetness and caramelized flavors from its production process the sauce is also used in red cooking.
* Shrimp soy sauce ( &quot;Xiā zǐ jiàngyóu&quot;): Fresh soy sauce is simmered with fresh shrimp and finished with sugar, baijiu (type of distilled liquor, 白酒), and spices. A specialty of Suzhou.

Besides the above traditional types, hydrolyzed vegetable protein and other flavor enhancers may be mixed with brewed soy sauce to produce cheaper substitutes. This type is known as &quot;blended soy sauce&quot; () in China until 2019, when a chinese 2018 standard that removed this type from the definition of soy sauce went into effect.

The 2018 chinese standard defines soy sauce as &quot;liquid condiments with special color, aroma and taste made from soybeans and/or defatted soybeans, wheat and/or wheat flour and/or wheat bran as main raw materials through microbial fermentation.&quot; It still allows food additives to be used &quot;following the definitions of GB 2760&quot;, which does not restrict the use of MSG and disodium ribonucleotides. (Hydrolyzed vegetable protein is not listed as a food additive in GB 2760 and is therefore unacceptable in products labelled as &quot;soy sauce&quot;.)

=== Filipino ===
In the Philippines, soy sauce is called toyò in the native languages, derived from &quot;tau-yu&quot; in Philippine Hokkien. Philippine soy sauce is usually a combination of soybeans, wheat, salt, and caramel color. It is thinner in texture and has a saltier taste than its Southeast Asian counterparts. It is most similar to the Japanese &quot;koikuchi shōyu&quot; in terms of consistency and the use of wheat, though toyò is a bit saltier and darker in color.

Toyò is used as a marinade, an ingredient in cooked dishes, and most often as a table condiment, usually alongside other sauces such as fish sauce (&quot;patís&quot;) and sugar cane vinegar (&quot;sukà&quot;). It is often mixed and served with the juice of the calamansi (× &quot;Citrofortunella microcarpa&quot;; also called calamondin, &quot;limonsito&quot;). The combination is known as &quot;toyomansî&quot;, which can be comparable to the Japanese &quot;ponzu&quot; sauce (soy sauce with yuzu). &quot;Toyò&quot; is also a main ingredient in Philippine adobo, one of the more famous dishes of Filipino cuisine.

=== Hawaiian ===
Soy sauce is a ubiquitous condiment and ingredient in many dishes in Hawaiian cuisine, where it is commonly known by its Japanese name by locals. &quot;Aloha Shoyu&quot; is a soy sauce manufacturer in Hawaii that produces a popular soy sauce whose flavor is more delicate and somewhat sweeter compared to other more well-known soy sauces.

=== Indonesian ===

In Indonesia, soy sauce is known as &quot;kecap&quot; (old spelling: &quot;ketjap&quot;), which is a catch-all term for fermented sauces, and cognate to the English word &quot;ketchup&quot;. The most popular type of soy sauce in Indonesian cuisine is &quot;kecap manis&quot; or sweet soy sauce. The term &quot;kecap&quot; is also used to describe other condiments and sauces of a similar appearance, such as &quot;kecap ikan&quot; (fish sauce) and &quot;kecap Inggris&quot; (worcestershire sauce; lit. &quot;English sauce&quot; or &quot;England sauce&quot;). Three common varieties of soy-based &quot;kecap&quot; exist in Indonesian cuisine, used either as ingredients or condiments:

* &quot;Kecap manis&quot;: Sweetened soy sauce, which has a thick syrupy consistency and a unique, pronounced, sweet, somewhat treacle-like flavor due to generous addition of palm sugar. Regular soy with brown sugar and a trace of molasses added can substitute. It is by far the most popular type of soy sauce employed in Indonesian cuisine, accounts for an estimated 90 percent of the nation&#x27;s total soy sauce production. &quot;Kecap manis&quot; is an important sauce in Indonesian signature dishes, such as &quot;nasi goreng&quot;, &quot;mie goreng&quot;, satay, &quot;tongseng&quot; and &quot;semur&quot;. &quot;Sambal kecap&quot; for example is type of &quot;sambal&quot; dipping sauce of kecap manis with sliced chili, tomato and shallot, a popular dipping sauce for &quot;sate kambing&quot; (goat meat satay) and &quot;ikan bakar&quot; (grilled fish/seafood). Since soy sauce is of Chinese origin, &quot;kecap asin&quot; is also an important seasoning in Chinese Indonesian cuisine.
* &quot;Kecap manis sedang&quot;: Medium sweet soy sauce, which has a less thick consistency, is less sweet and has a saltier taste than &quot;kecap manis&quot;.
* &quot;Kecap asin&quot;: Regular soy sauce derived from the Japanese &quot;shoyu&quot;, but usually more concentrated and thicker, with a darker color and stronger flavor; it can be replaced by Chinese light soy sauce in some recipes. Salty soy sauce was first introduced into Indonesia by Hokkien people so its taste resembles that of Chinese soy sauce. Hakka soy sauce made from black beans is very salty and large productions are mainly made in Bangka Island.

=== Japanese ===
 is officially divided into five main types by the JAS (Japanese Agricultural Standard) depending on differences in their ingredients and method of production. These types are , , , , and .

Most, but not all, Japanese soy sauces include wheat as a primary ingredient, which tends to give them a slightly sweeter taste than their Chinese counterparts. They also tend towards an alcoholic sherry-like flavor, sometimes enhanced by the addition of small amounts of alcohol as a natural preservative. The widely varying flavors of these soy sauces are not always interchangeable, so some recipes only call for one type or the other, much as a white wine cannot replace a red&#x27;s flavor or beef stock does not make the same results as fish stock.

Some soy sauces made in the Japanese way or styled after them contain about 50% wheat.

==== Varieties ====
* : Originating in the Kantō region, its usage eventually spread all over Japan. Over 80% of the Japanese domestic soy sauce production is of , and can be considered the typical Japanese soy sauce. It is made from roughly equal quantities of soybean and wheat. This variety is also called or when it is not pasteurized.
* : Almost 14% of soy sauce production is . It is particularly popular in the Kansai region of Japan. It matures for less time than and is both saltier and lighter in color. It is paler due to the use in its production of , a sweet liquid made from fermented rice. is commonly used in cooking as it does not alter the color and taste of the ingredients.
* : Made mainly in the Chūbu region of Japan, is darker in appearance and richer in flavor than . It contains little or no wheat. Wheat-free can be used by people with gluten intolerance. Tamari is more viscous than . Of soy sauce produced in Japan, 1.5% is . It is the &quot;original&quot; Japanese soy sauce, as its recipe is closest to the soy sauce originally introduced to Japan from China. Technically, this variety is known as , as this is the liquid that runs off miso (a soybean-based seasoning and soup base) as it matures. The Japanese word is derived from the verb , referring to the fact that was traditionally a liquid byproduct made during the fermentation of miso. Japan remains the leading producer of , though it has also become popular in the United States. is often used for sashimi. Oftentimes, other varieties of soy sauce for sashimi are inaccurately referred to as tamari shoyu. The back label in Japan, by law, will clarify whether or not it is actually tamari.
* : In contrast to soy sauce, uses mostly wheat and very little soybean, lending it a light appearance and sweet taste. It is more commonly used in the Kansai region to highlight the appearances of food, for example sashimi. used to be used a lot in high-class cookery and is generally not available abroad. Its main use is for pickles. Of soy sauce production in Japan, 0.7% is .
* : This variety substitutes previously made &quot;koikuchi&quot; for the brine normally used in the process. Consequently, it is much darker and more strongly flavored. This type is also known as . Of soy sauce production in Japan, 0.8% is .
* is a variety of soy sauce made exclusively in Yanai, a city in Yamaguchi Prefecture. It is handmade and is less salty and less sweet than .
* &quot;Amakuchi&quot; (甘口, &#x27;sweet taste&#x27;): It is similar to &quot;koikuchi&quot; soy sauce, but with sweetener added. It is the most popular type of soy sauce in Kyushu region of Japan, which is famous for sweet foods. In some cases, it is more common to find &quot;amakuchi shoyu&quot; than &quot;koikuchi shoyu&quot; in Kyushu.

Newer varieties of Japanese soy sauce include:

* : This version contains 50% less salt than regular soy sauce for consumers concerned about heart disease.
* : This version contains 20% less salt than regular soy sauce.

All of these varieties are sold in three different grades according to how they were made:

* : Contains 100% genuine fermented product
* : Contains genuine fermented mash mixed with 30–50% of chemical or enzymatic hydrolysate of plant protein
* : Contains or mixed with 30–50% of chemical or enzymatic hydrolysate of plant protein

All the varieties and grades may be sold according to three official levels of quality:

* : standard grade, contains more than 1.2% total nitrogen
* : upper grade, contains more than 1.35% of total nitrogen
* : special grade, contains more than 1.5% of total nitrogen

=== Korean ===
In South Korea, soy sauces or &quot;ganjang&quot; (, &quot;seasoning sauce&quot;) can be roughly split into two categories: &quot;hansik ganjang&quot; (&#x27;Korean-style soy sauce&#x27;) and (&#x27;modernized soy sauce&#x27;). The term can also refer to non-soy-based salty condiments, such as fish sauce&quot;.
==== &quot;Hansik ganjang&quot; ====
 (, &#x27;Korean-style soy sauce&#x27;) is made entirely of fermented soybean (meju) and brine. It is a byproduct of &quot;doenjang&quot; (fermented soybean paste) production, and has a unique fermented soybean flavour. Both lighter in colour and saltier than other Korean ganjang varieties, &quot;hansik ganjang&quot; is used mainly in guk (soup) and namul (seasoned vegetable dish) in modern Korean cuisine. Common names for &quot;hansik ganjang&quot; include &quot;jaeraesik ganjang&quot; (, &quot;traditional soy sauce&quot;), &quot;Joseon-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;Joseon soy sauce&quot;), and &quot;guk-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;soup soy sauce&quot;). The homebrewed variety is also called &quot;jip-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;home soy sauce&quot;).

Depending on the length of aging, &quot;hansik ganjang&quot; can be divided into three main varieties: clear, middle, and dark.
* &quot;Haet-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;new soy sauce&quot;) – soy sauce aged for a year. Also called &quot;cheongjang&quot; (, &quot;clear soy sauce&quot;).
* &quot;Jung-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;middle soy sauce&quot;) – soy sauce aged for three to four years.
* &quot;Jin-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;dark soy sauce&quot;) – soy sauce aged for more than five years. Also called &quot;jinjang&quot; (, &quot;aged soy sauce&quot;), &quot;nongjang&quot; (, &quot;thick soy sauce&quot;), or &quot;jingamjang&quot; (, &quot;aged mature soy sauce&quot;).
Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety&#x27;s Food Code classifies &quot;hansik-ganjang&quot; into two categories by their ingredients.
* &quot;Jaerae-hansik-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;traditional Korean-style soy sauce&quot;) – made with traditional style meju and brine.
* &quot;Gaeryang-hansik-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;modernized Korean-style soy sauce&quot;) – made with nontraditional meju (which can be made of regular soybean, rice, barley, wheat, or soybean meal, and ripened using traditional method or &quot;Aspergillus&quot;) and brine.

==== &quot;Gaeryang ganjang&quot; ====
&quot;Gaeryang-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;modernized soy sauce&quot;), referring to varieties of soy sauces not made of meju, is now the most widely used type of soy sauce in modern Korean cuisine. The word &quot;ganjang&quot; without modifiers in bokkeum (stir-fry), jorim (braised or simmered dishes), and jjim (steamed dishes) recipes usually mean &quot;gaeryang-ganjang&quot;. Another common name of &quot;gaeryang-ganjang&quot; is &quot;jin-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;dark soy sauce&quot;), because &quot;gaeryang-ganjang&quot; varieties are usually darker in appearance compared to traditional &quot;hansik ganjang&quot;. Having been introduced to Korea during the era of Japanese forced occupation, &quot;garyang ganjang&quot; is also called &quot;Wae-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;Wae soy sauce&quot;).

Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety&#x27;s Food Code classifies &quot;gaeryang-ganjang&quot; into four categories by their method of production.
* Brewed soy sauce (, &quot;yangjo-ganjang&quot;) – made by fermenting soybean, soybean meal, or other grains with saline solution.
* Acid-hydrolyzed soy sauce () – made by hydrolyzing raw materials containing protein with acid.
* Enzyme-hydrolyzed soy sauce () – made by hydrolyzing raw materials containing protein with enzyme.
* Blended soy sauce () – Also called mixed soy sauce, blended soy sauce can be made by blending &quot;hansik-ganjang&quot; (Korean-style soy sauce) or &quot;yangjo-ganjang&quot; (brewed soy sauce) with acid-hydrolyzed soy sauce or enzyme-hydrolyzed soy sauce.

==== Other ====
* &quot;Eo-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;fish sauce&quot;): Made mainly in Jeju island, &quot;eo-ganjang&quot; is a soy sauce substitute made of &quot;jeotgal&quot; (fermented fish).

=== Malaysian and Singaporean ===
Malays from Malaysia, using the Malay dialect similar to Indonesian, use the word &quot;kicap&quot; for soy sauce. &quot;Kicap&quot; is traditionally of two types: &quot;kicap lemak&quot; (lit &quot;fat/rich soy sauce&quot;) and &quot;kicap cair&quot;. &quot;Kicap lemak&quot; is similar to Indonesian &quot;kecap manis&quot; but with very much less sugar, while &quot;kicap cair&quot; is the Malaysian equivalent of &quot;kecap asin&quot;.

=== Peru ===
Soy sauce, known in Peru as &quot;sillao&quot; from the Cantonese name of the item, is an important ingredient in Chifa.

=== Sri Lankan ===
Soy sauce () is a popular food product used in Sri Lanka and is a major ingredient used in the nationally popular street food dish kottu. Soy sauce has largely been produced by the Sri Lankan Chinese community but its production has also spread to other communities in Sri Lanka. Soy sauce production in Sri Lanka is the same as the production of soy sauce in Indonesia. Fermentation occurs over a period of three months. The soy beans which are steeped in brine are then pressed to obtain a liquid sauce.

=== Taiwanese ===
The history of soy sauce making in Taiwan can be traced back to southeastern China, in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Taiwanese soy sauce is known for its black bean variant, known as black bean soy sauce (黑豆蔭油), which producers claim to have stronger flavor and more nutrition. Most soy sauce makers in Taiwan make soy sauce from soybeans and wheat using machines, which is a technique introduced during Japanese rule. A smaller number of producers continue to handmake soy sauce in the traditional way.

=== Thai ===

In Thailand, soy sauce is called &quot;sii-íu&quot; (). &quot;Sii-íu kǎao&quot; (, &#x27;white soy sauce&#x27;) is used as regular soy sauce in Thai cuisine, while &quot;sii-íu dam&quot; (, &#x27;black soy sauce&#x27;) is used primarily for colour. Another darker-coloured variety, &quot;sii-íu wǎan&quot; (, &#x27;sweet soy sauce&#x27;) is used for dipping sauces. &quot;Sɔ́ɔt prung rót&quot; (, &#x27;seasoning sauce&#x27;) is also commonly used in modern Thai cuisine.

=== Vietnamese ===

In Vietnam, Chinese-style soy sauce is called &quot;xì dầu&quot; (derived from the Cantonese name 豉油) or &quot;nước tương&quot;. The term &quot;soy sauce&quot; could also imply other condiments and soy bean paste with thick consistency known as &quot;tương&quot;. Both are used mostly as a seasoning or dipping sauce for a number of dishes. Vietnamese cuisine itself favors fish sauce in cooking, but &quot;nước tương&quot; has a clear presence in vegetarian cuisine and Buddhist cuisine.

== Nutrition ==
A study by the National University of Singapore showed that Chinese dark soy sauce contains 10 times the antioxidants of red wine. Unpasteurized soy sauce is rich in lactic acid bacteria and of excellent anti-allergic potential.

Soy sauce does not contain the level of isoflavones associated with other soy products, such as tofu or edamame. It can also be very salty, having a salt content between 14 and 18%. Low-sodium soy sauces are made, but it is difficult to make soy sauce without using some quantity of salt as an antimicrobial agent.

A serving of of soy sauce contains, according to the USDA:
* Energy : 60 kcal
* Fat: 0.1 g
* Carbohydrates: 5.57 g
* Fibers: 0.8 g
* Protein: 10.51 g
* Sodium: 6 g

=== Carcinogens ===
Soy sauce may contain ethyl carbamate, a Group 2A carcinogen.

In 2001, the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency found in testing various soy sauces manufactured in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand (made from hydrolyzed soy protein, rather than being naturally fermented) that 22% of tested samples contained a chemical carcinogen named 3-MCPD (3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol) at levels considerably higher than those deemed safe by the EU. About two-thirds of these samples also contained a second carcinogenic chemical named 1,3-DCP (1,3-dichloropropane-2-ol) which experts advise should not be present at any levels in food. Both chemicals have the potential to cause cancer, and the Agency recommended that the affected products be withdrawn from shelves and avoided. The same carcinogens were found in soy sauces manufactured in Vietnam, causing a food scare in 2007.

In Canada, the Canadian Cancer Society writes,

=== Allergies ===
Soy sauce allergy not caused by soy or wheat allergy is rare. Most varieties of soy sauce contain wheat, to which some people have a medical intolerance. However, protein hydrolysis (fermentation or industrial) breaks down gluten, so some soy sauces may end up tolerable to gluten-intolerant individuals with no detectable gluten left. Japanese tamari soy sauce is traditionally wheat-free, and some tamari available commercially today is wheat- and gluten-free.

Acid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein is non-allergenic due to the completeness of protein breakdown.

<text>Klez is a computer worm that propagates via e-mail. It first appeared in October 2001 and was originated in China. A number of variants of the worm exist.

The virus (Klez) itself is a Windows PE EXE file of about 65KB, and it operates on WIN32 platforms. 

Klez infects Microsoft Windows systems, exploiting a vulnerability in Internet Explorer&#x27;s Trident layout engine, used by both Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express to render HTML mail.

The e-mail through which the worm spreads always includes a text portion and one or more attachments. The text portion consists of either an HTML internal frame tag which causes buggy e-mail clients to automatically execute the worm, or a few lines of text that attempt to induce the recipient to execute the worm by opening the attachment (sometimes by claiming that the attachment is a patch from Microsoft; sometimes by claiming that the attachment is an antidote for the Klez worm). The first attachment is always the worm, whose internals vary.

Once the worm is executed, either automatically by the buggy HTML engine or manually by a user, it searches for addresses to send itself to. When it sends itself out, it may attach a file from the infected machine, leading to possible privacy breaches.

Later variants of the worm would use a false &quot;From&quot; address, picking an e-mail address at random from the infected machine&#x27;s Outlook or Outlook Express address book, making it impossible for casual observers to determine which machine is infected, and making it difficult for experts to determine anything more than the infected machine&#x27;s Internet Service Provider.

<doc id="62155" wikidata="Q2596997" url="?curid=62155" title="Condiment">
<text>A condiment is a preparation that is added to food, typically after cooking, to impart a specific flavour, to enhance the flavour, or to complement the dish. 

Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavour texture: barbecue sauce, compound butter, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, Marmite and sour cream are examples. 

Alternatively, condiments are sometimes added prior to serving, for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise. 

A table condiment or table sauce is served separately from the food and added to taste by the diner. Many, such as mustard or ketchup, are available in single-serving packets, commonly when supplied with take-out or fast food meals.

==Definition==

The exact definition of a condiment varies. Some definitions encompass spices and herbs, including salt and pepper, using the term interchangeably with &quot;seasoning&quot;. Others restrict the definition to include only &quot;prepared food compound[s], containing one or more spices&quot;, which are added to food after the cooking process, such as mustard, ketchup or mint sauce.
==Etymology==
The term &quot;condiment&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;condimentum&quot;, meaning &quot;spice, seasoning, sauce&quot; and from the Latin &quot;condire&quot;, meaning &quot;preserve, pickle, season&quot;. The term originally described pickled or preserved foods, but its meaning has changed over time.

==History==
Condiments were known in historical Ancient Rome, India, Greece and China. There is a myth that before food preservation techniques were widespread, pungent spices and condiments were used to make the food more palatable, but this claim is not supported by any evidence or historical record. The Romans made the condiments garum and liquamen, a similar and at times synonymous preparation, by crushing the innards of various fish and then fermenting them in salt, resulting in a liquid containing glutamic acid, suitable for enhancing the flavour of food. The popularity of these sauces led to a flourishing condiment industry. &quot;Apicius&quot;, a cookbook based on fourth and fifth century cuisine, contains a section based solely on condiments.

==List of condiments==

==Market==

In the United States, the market for condiments was US$5.6 billion in 2010 and was estimated to grow to US$7 billion by 2015. The condiment market is the second largest in specialty foods behind that of cheese.

<doc id="62158" wikidata="Q145777" url="?curid=62158" title="Convolvulaceae">
<text>Convolvulaceae (), commonly called the bindweeds or morning glories, is a family of about 60 genera and more than 1,650 species. These species are primarily herbaceous vines, but also include trees, shrubs and herbs. The tubers of several species are edible, the best known of which is the sweet potato. 

== Description ==
Convolvulaceae can be recognized by their funnel-shaped, radially symmetrical corolla; the floral formula for the family has five sepals, five fused petals, five epipetalous stamens (stamens fused to the petals), and a two-part syncarpous and superior gynoecium. The stems of these plants are usually winding, hence their Latin name (from &quot;convolvere&quot;, &quot;to wind&quot;). The leaves are simple and alternate, without stipules. In parasitic Cuscuta (dodder) they are reduced to scales. The fruit can be a capsule, berry, or nut, all containing only two seeds per one locule (one ovule/ovary).
The leaves and starchy, tuberous roots of some species are used as foodstuffs (e.g. sweet potato and water spinach), and the seeds are exploited for their medicinal value as purgatives. Some species contain ergoline alkaloids that are likely responsible for the use of these species as ingredients in psychedelic drugs (e.g. ololiuhqui). The presence of ergolines in some species of this family is due to infection by fungi related to the ergot fungi of the genus &quot;Claviceps&quot;. A recent study of Convolvulaceae species, &quot;Ipomoea asarifolia&quot;, and its associated fungi showed the presence of a fungus, identified by DNA sequencing of 18s and ITS ribosomal DNA and phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to fungi in the family Clavicipitaceae, was always associated with the presence of ergoline alkaloids in the plant. The identified fungus appears to be a seed-transmitted, obligate biotroph growing epiphytically on its host. This finding strongly suggests the unique presence of ergoline alkaloids in some species of the family Convolvulaceae is due to symbiosis with clavicipitaceous fungi. Moreover, another group of compounds, loline alkaloids, commonly produced by some members of the clavicipitaceous fungi (genus &quot;Neotyphodium&quot;), has been identified in a convolvulaceous species, but the origin of the loline alkaloids in this species is unknown.

Members of the family are well known as food plants (e.g. sweet potatoes and water spinach), as showy garden plants (e.g. morning glory) and as troublesome weeds (e.g. bindweed (mainly &quot;Convolvulus&quot; and &quot;Calystegia&quot;) and dodder), while &quot;Humbertia madagascariensis&quot; is a medium-sized tree and &quot;Ipomoea carnea&quot; is an erect shrub. Some parasitic members of this family are also used medicinally.

<text>The Bakweri (or Kwe) are a Bantu ethnic group of the Republic of Cameroon. They are closely related to Cameroon&#x27;s coastal peoples (the Sawa), particularly the Duala and Isubu.

Early survey discussion of these topics may be found in Ardener 1956 and Dugast 1949

==History==

===Early population movements===
 The Bakweri likely migrated to their present home east of the mountain in the mid-18th century. From the foothills, they gradually spread to the coast, and up the Mungo River and the various creeks that empty into it. In the process, they founded numerous villages, usually when individual families groups split off. A rival Bakweri tradition says they descend from Mokuri or Mokule, a brother of the Duala&#x27;s forebear Ewale, who migrated to the Mount Cameroon area for hunting. In addition, a few isolated villages, such as Maumu and Bojongo, claim some alternate descent and may represent earlier groups whom the expanding Bakweri absorbed.

===European contacts===
Portuguese traders reached the Cameroonian coast in 1472. Over the next few decades, more adventurers came to explore the estuary and the rivers that feed it, and to establish trading posts. The Bakweri provided materials to the coastal tribes, who acted as middlemen.

===German administration===
Germany signed a protectorate agreement with the douala in today Cameroons in 1884. In 1891, the Gbea Bakweri clan rose up in support of their traditional justice system when the Germans forbade them to use a trial by ordeal involving poison to determine whether a recent Christian convert was in fact a witch. This revolt was squelched with the razing of Buea in December 1894 and the death of Chief Kuv&#x27;a Likenye.

The Germans initially ruled from Douala, which they called Kamerunstadt, but they moved their capital to the Bakweri settlement of Buea in 1901. The colonials&#x27; primary activity was the establishment of banana plantations in the fertile Mount Cameroon region. The Bakweri were impressed to work them, but their recalcitrance and small population led the colonials to encourage peoples from further inland, such as the Bamileke, to move to the coast. In addition, constant shipping traffic along the coast allowed individuals to move from one plantation or town to another in search of work.

===British administration===
In 1918, Germany lost World War I, and her colonies became mandates of the League of Nations. Great Britain took control of Bakweri lands. Great Britain integrated its portion of Cameroon with the neighbouring colony of Nigeria, setting the new province&#x27;s capital at Buea. The British practised a policy of indirect rule, entrusting greater powers to Bakweri chiefs in Buea.

The new colonials maintained the German policies of ousting uncooperative rulers and of impressing workers for the plantations. Individuals could opt to pay a fine to avoid the labour, however, which led to a dearth of workers from the wealthier areas. The British thus renewed encouragement for people from the interior to move to the coast and work the plantations. Many Igbo from Nigeria entered the area, and the newcomers grew numerically and economically dominant over time. This led to ethnic tensions with the indigenes. Land expropriation was another problem, faced particularly in 1946.

A Bakwerian, Dr. E. M. L. Endeley was the first Prime Minister of the British Southern Cameroons from 1954–1959. He led other Southern Cameroonian parliamentarians to secede from the Nigerian Eastern House of Assembly in 1954.

==Geography==

The Bakweri are primarily concentrated in Cameroon&#x27;s Southwest Province. They live in over 100 villages east and southeast of Mount Cameroon with Buea their main population centre. Bakweri settlements largely lie in the mountain&#x27;s foothills and continue up its slopes as high as 4,000 metres. They have further villages along the Mungo River and the creeks that feed into it. The town of Limbe is a mixture of Bakweri, Duala, and other ethnic groups.

There is an ongoing dispute between the Bakweri Land Claims Committee (BLCC) and the government of Cameroon regarding the disposition of Bakweri Lands formerly used by the Germans as plantations and now managed by the Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC).

==Culture==
The Bakweri today are divided into the urban and rural. Those who live in the cities such as Limbe and Buea earn a living at a number of skilled and unskilled professions. The rural Bakweri, in contrast, work as farmers, making use of Mount Cameroon&#x27;s fertile volcanic soils to cultivate cocoyams, maize, manioc, oil palms, and plantains.

Traditional Bakweri society was divided into three strata. At the top were the native Bakweri, with full rights of land ownership. The next tier consisted either non-Bakweri or the descendants of slaves. Finally, the slaves made up the bottom rung. Chiefs and headmen sat at the pinnacle of this hierarchy in the past, though today such figures have very little power in their own right. Councils of elders and secret societies allow communities to decide important issues.

===Language===
The Bakweri speak Mokpwe, a tongue that is closely related to Bakole and Wumboko. Mokpwe is part of the family of Duala languages in the Bantu group of the Niger–Congo language family. Neighbouring peoples often utilise Mokpwe as a trade language, due largely to the spread of the tongue by early missionaries. This is particularly true among the Isubu, many of whom are bilingual in Duala or Mokpwe. In addition, individuals who have attended school or lived in an urban centre usually speak Cameroonian Pidgin English or standard English. A growing number of the Bakweri today grow up with Pidgin as a more widely spoken language. The Bakweri also used a drum language to convey news from clan to clan, and they also utilized a horn language peculiar to them.

===Marriage and kinship patterns===
Bakweri inheritance is patrilineal; upon the father&#x27;s death, his property is inherited by his eldest son. The Bakweri have traditionally practised polygamy, although with Christianisation, this custom has become extremely rare. In the traditional Bakweri society, women are chosen as future spouses when they are still children, and in some cases, even before they were born. The father or relative of the woman have been paid a dowry, thus the woman is considered as a property to the husband and his family. Upon the husband&#x27;s death, the eldest surviving brother inherits the wife. A husband&#x27;s prosperity was also intricately linked to the influence of his wife or wives. The wives tended his pigs, goats, cattle, arable land, so no one could trespass or exceed them, etc.

===Religion===
The Bakweri have been largely Christianised since the 1970s Evangelical denominations dominate, particularly the Baptist church.

Nevertheless, remnants of a pre-Christian ancestor worship persist. might be expected for coastal peoples, the sea also plays an important role in this faith. Traditional festivals held each year serve as the most visible expression of these traditional beliefs in modern times.

===Arts===
The Bakweri still practice arts and crafts handed down for generations. The Bakweri are known to be skilled weavers of hats and shirts, for example. They also construct armoires, chairs, and tables.

The greatest venue for Bakweri music and dance are the two major festivals that take place each year in December. The Ngondo is a traditional festival of the Duala, although today all of Cameroon&#x27;s coastal Sawa peoples are invited to participate. It originated as a means of training Duala children the skills of warfare. Now, however, the main focus is on communicating with the ancestors and asking them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, beauty pageants, pirogue races, and traditional wrestling.

The Mpo&#x27;o brings together the Bakoko, Bakweri, and Limba at Edéa. The festival commemorates the ancestors and allows the participants to consider the problems facing the groups and humanity as a whole.

==Institutions==
Assemblies, secret societies, and other groups play an important role in keeping the Bakweri unified, helping them set goals, and giving them a venue to find solutions to common problems. Secret societies include the Leingu, Maalé (Elephant dance), Mbwaya, and Nganya.

The Bakweri are Bantu in language and origin. More narrowly, they fall into the Sawa, or the coastal peoples of Cameroon.

<text>The rotifers (, from Latin &#x27;wheel&#x27; and &#x27;bearing&#x27;), sometimes called wheel animals or wheel animalcules, make up a phylum (Rotifera ) of microscopic and near-microscopic pseudocoelomate animals.

They were first described by Rev. John Harris in 1696, and other forms were described by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1703. Most rotifers are around long (although their size can range from to over ), and are common in freshwater environments throughout the world with a few saltwater species.

Some rotifers are free swimming and truly planktonic, others move by inchworming along a substrate, and some are sessile, living inside tubes or gelatinous holdfasts that are attached to a substrate. About 25 species are colonial (e.g., &quot;Sinantherina semibullata&quot;), either sessile or planktonic. Rotifers are an important part of the freshwater zooplankton, being a major foodsource and with many species also contributing to the decomposition of soil organic matter. Most species of the rotifers are cosmopolitan, but there are also some endemic species, like &quot;Cephalodella vittata&quot; to Lake Baikal. Recent barcoding evidence, however, suggests that some &#x27;cosmopolitan&#x27; species, such as &quot;Brachionus plicatilis&quot;, &quot;B. calyciflorus&quot;, &quot;Lecane bulla&quot;, among others, are actually species complexes. In some recent treatments, rotifers are placed with acanthocephalans in a larger clade called Syndermata.

In June 2021, biologists reported the restoration of bdelloid rotifers after being frozen for 24,000 years in the Siberian permafrost. Early purported fossils of rotifers have been suggested in Devonian and Permian fossil beds.

== Taxonomy and naming ==
John Harris first described the rotifers (in particular a bdelloid rotifer) in 1696 as &quot;an animal like a large maggot which could contract itself into a spherical figure and then stretch itself out again; the end of its tail appeared with a forceps like that of an earwig&quot;. In 1702, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek gave a detailed description of &quot;Rotifer vulgaris&quot; and subsequently described &quot;Melicerta ringens&quot; and other species. He was also the first to publish observations of the revivification of certain species after drying. Other forms were described by other observers, but it was not until the publication of Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg&#x27;s in 1838 that the rotifers were recognized as being multicellular animals.

About 2,200 species of rotifers have been described. Their taxonomy is currently in a state of flux. One treatment places them in the phylum Rotifera, with three classes: Seisonidea, Bdelloidea and Monogononta. The largest group is the Monogononta, with about 1,500 species, followed by the Bdelloidea, with about 350 species. There are only two known genera with three species of Seisonidea.

The Acanthocephala, previously considered to be a separate phylum, have been demonstrated to be modified rotifers. The exact relationship to other members of the phylum has not yet been resolved. One possibility is that the Acanthocephala are closer to the Bdelloidea and Monogononta than to the Seisonidea; the corresponding names and relationships are shown in the cladogram below.

The Rotifera, strictly speaking, are confined to the Bdelloidea and the Monogononta. Rotifera, Acanthocephala and Seisonida make up a clade called Syndermata.

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;&quot; is derived from a Neo-Latin word meaning &#x27;wheel-bearer&#x27; due to the corona around the mouth that in concerted sequential motion resembles a wheel (although the organ does not actually rotate).

== Anatomy ==
Rotifers have bilateral symmetry and a variety of different shapes. The body of a rotifer is divided into a head, trunk, and foot, and is typically somewhat cylindrical. There is a well-developed cuticle, which may be thick and rigid, giving the animal a box-like shape, or flexible, giving the animal a worm-like shape; such rotifers are respectively called &quot;loricate&quot; and &quot;illoricate&quot;. Rigid cuticles are often composed of multiple plates, and may bear spines, ridges, or other ornamentation. Their cuticle is nonchitinous and is formed from sclerotized proteins.

The two most distinctive features of rotifers (in females of all species) are the presence of &quot;corona&quot; on the head, a structure ciliated in all genera except &quot;Cupelopagis&quot; and presence of mastax. In the more primitive species, the corona forms a simple ring of cilia around the mouth from which an additional band of cilia stretches over the back of the head. In the great majority of rotifers, however, this has evolved into a more complex structure.

Modifications to the basic plan of the corona include alteration of the cilia into bristles or large tufts, and either expansion or loss of the ciliated band around the head. In genera such as &quot;Collotheca&quot;, the corona is modified to form a funnel surrounding the mouth. In many species, such as those in the genus &quot;Testudinella&quot;, the cilia around the mouth have disappeared, leaving just two small circular bands on the head. In the bdelloids, this plan is further modified, with the upper band splitting into two rotating wheels, raised up on a pedestal projecting from the upper surface of the head.

The trunk forms the major part of the body, and encloses most of the internal organs. The foot projects from the rear of the trunk, and is usually much narrower, giving the appearance of a tail. The cuticle over the foot often forms rings, making it appear segmented, although the internal structure is uniform. Many rotifers can retract the foot partially or wholly into the trunk. The foot ends in from one to four toes, which, in sessile and crawling species, contain adhesive glands to attach the animal to the substratum. In many free-swimming species, the foot as a whole is reduced in size, and may even be absent.

=== Nervous system ===
Rotifers have a small cerebral ganglion, effectively its brain, located just above the mastax, from which a number of nerves extend throughout the body. The number of nerves varies among species, although the nervous system usually has a simple layout. 

The nervous system comprises about 25% of the roughly 1,000 cells in a rotifer.

Rotifers typically possess one or two pairs of short antennae and up to five eyes. The eyes are simple in structure, sometimes with just a single photoreceptor cell. In addition, the bristles of the corona are sensitive to touch, and there are also a pair of tiny sensory pits lined by cilia in the head region.

=== Retrocerebral organ ===
Despite over 100 years of research, rotifer anatomy still has many poorly understood components. One of the more mysterious organs in rotifers is the &quot;retrocerebral organ&quot; (RCO), which still remains very enigmatic in its morphology, function, development, and evolution. Lying close to the brain, this organ usually consists of one or more glands and a sac or reservoir. The sac drains into a duct before opening through pores on the uppermost part of the head. Current data shows a wide diversity in structure and potential function. In some species it is reduced or may even be absent completely. Benthic species have larger RCO&#x27;s than planktonic species. Despite this diversity, positional correspondence of RCOs strongly suggests homology.

A 2023 study using transmission electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy has illuminated the fine structure of this organ further. The study, the first of its kind, investigated the RCO in one species, &quot;Trichocerca similis&quot;. It was determined to be a syncytial organ, composed of a posterior glandular region, an expansive reservoir, and an anterior duct. The glandular portion has an active cytoplasm with paired nuclei, abundant rough ER, ribosomes, Golgi, and mitochondria. Secretion granules accumulate at the anterior end of the gland where they undergo homotypic fusion to create larger granules with numerous &quot;mesh-like&quot; contents. These contents gradually fuse into tubular secretions that accumulate in the reservoir, awaiting secretion. Cross-striated longitudinal muscles form a partial sleeve around the reservoir and may function to squeeze the secretions through the gland&#x27;s duct that often penetrates through the cerebral ganglion.
====Retrocerebral organ secretions====
Much like the organ itself, the precise function and biochemical makeup of the secretions is still unknown. The small size of rotifers and small volume of the secretions makes isolation immensely difficult. The secretions have some similarities to the hydrogel secretions that form gelatinous housings in some rotifer species.
Ultrastructure analysis of &quot;T. similis&quot; secretions showed them to be a series of tube-like secretions with a highly filamentous framework. This is highly suggestive of a glycosaminoglycan structure- proteins with negatively charged polysaccharide chains forming proteoglycan molecules. These molecules are standard in vertebrate and invertebrate gelatins such as mucus. 

Despite recent advancements in understanding RCO organ and secretion ultrastructure, the exact function of the organ is still ultimately unclear. The leading hypotheses are that the RCO secretes a mucus-like substance that aids in benthic locomotion, adhesion, and/or reproduction (i.e., attachment of eggs to a substrate), although more research is needed to explore function and evaluate the homology between species.

=== Digestive system ===


The coronal cilia create a current that sweeps food into the mouth. The mouth opens into a characteristic chewing pharynx (called the &quot;mastax&quot;), sometimes via a ciliated tube, and sometimes directly. The pharynx has a powerful muscular wall and contains tiny, calcified, jaw-like structures called &quot;trophi&quot;, which are the only fossilizable parts of a rotifer. The shape of the trophi varies between different species, depending partly on the nature of their diet. In suspension feeders, the trophi are covered in grinding ridges, while in more actively carnivorous species, they may be shaped like forceps to help bite into prey. In some ectoparasitic rotifers, the mastax is adapted to grip onto the host, although, in others, the foot performs this function instead.

Behind the mastax lies an oesophagus, which opens into a stomach where most of the digestion and absorption occurs. The stomach opens into a short intestine that terminates in a cloaca on the posterior dorsal surface of the animal. Up to seven salivary glands are present in some species, emptying to the mouth in front of the oesophagus, while the stomach is associated with two gastric glands that produce digestive enzymes.

A pair of protonephridia open into a bladder that drains into the cloaca. These organs expel water from the body, helping to maintain osmotic balance.

===Biology===
The coronal cilia pull the animal, when unattached, through the water.

Like many other microscopic animals, adult rotifers frequently exhibit eutely—they have a fixed number of cells within a species, usually on the order of 1,000.

Bdelloid rotifer genomes contain two or more divergent copies of each gene, suggesting a long-term asexual evolutionary history. For example, four copies of hsp82 are found. Each is different and found on a different chromosome excluding the possibility of homozygous sexual reproduction.

==Feeding==
Rotifers eat particulate organic detritus, dead bacteria, algae, and protozoans. They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size. Like crustaceans, rotifers contribute to nutrient recycling. For this reason, they are used in fish tanks to help clean the water, to prevent clouds of waste matter. Rotifers affect the species composition of algae in ecosystems through their choice in grazing. Rotifers may compete with cladocera and copepods for planktonic food sources.

==Reproduction and life cycle==
Rotifers are dioecious and reproduce sexually or parthenogenetically. They are sexually dimorphic, with the females always being larger than the males. In some species, this is relatively mild, but in others the female may be up to ten times the size of the male. In parthenogenetic species, males may be present only at certain times of the year, or absent altogether.

The female reproductive system consists of one or two ovaries, each with a &quot;vitellarium&quot; gland that supplies the eggs with yolk. Together, each ovary and vitellarium form a single syncitial structure in the anterior part of the animal, opening through an oviduct into the cloaca.

Males do not usually have a functional digestive system, and are therefore short-lived, often being sexually fertile at birth. They have a single testicle and sperm duct, associated with a pair of glandular structures referred to as &quot;prostates&quot; (unrelated to the vertebrate prostate). The sperm duct opens into a gonopore at the posterior end of the animal, which is usually modified to form a penis. The gonopore is homologous to the cloaca of females, but in most species has no connection to the vestigial digestive system, which lacks an anus.

In the genus Asplanchna also the females lacks an anus, but have kept the cloacal opening for excretion and the release of eggs.

The phylum Rotifera encloses three classes that reproduce by three different mechanisms: Seisonidea only reproduce sexually; Bdelloidea reproduce exclusively by asexual parthenogenesis; Monogononta reproduce alternating these two mechanisms (&quot;cyclical parthenogenesis&quot; or &quot;heterogony&quot;). Parthenogenesis (amictic phase) dominates the monogonont life cycle, promoting fast population growth and colonization. In this phase males are absent and amictic females produce diploid eggs by mitosis which develop parthenogenetically into females that are clones of their mothers. Some amictic females can generate mictic females that will produce haploid eggs by meiosis. Mixis (meiosis) is induced by different types of stimulus depending on species. Haploid eggs develop into haploid dwarf males if they are not fertilized and into diploid &quot;resting eggs&quot; (or &quot;diapausing eggs&quot;) if they are fertilized by males.

Fertilization is internal. The male either inserts his penis into the female&#x27;s cloaca or uses it to penetrate her skin, injecting the sperm into the body cavity. The egg secretes a shell, and is attached either to the substratum, nearby plants, or the female&#x27;s own body. A few species, such as members of the &quot;Rotaria&quot;, are ovoviviparous, retaining the eggs inside their body until they hatch.

Most species hatch as miniature versions of the adult. Sessile species, however, are born as free-swimming larvae, which closely resemble the adults of related free-swimming species. Females grow rapidly, reaching their adult size within a few days, while males typically do not grow in size at all.

The life span of monogonont females varies from two days to about three weeks.

===Loss of sexual reproduction system===
&#x27;Ancient asexuals&#x27;: Bdelloid rotifers are assumed to have reproduced without sex for many millions of years. Males are absent within the species, and females reproduce only by parthenogenesis.

However, a new study provided evidence for interindividual genetic exchange and recombination in &quot;Adineta vaga&quot;, a species previously thought to be anciently asexual.

Recent transitions: Loss of sexual reproduction can be inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion in the monogonont rotifer &quot;Brachionus calyciflorus&quot;: This species can normally switch between sexual and asexual reproduction (cyclical parthenogenesis), but occasionally gives rise to purely asexual lineages (obligate parthenogens). These lineages are unable to reproduce sexually due to being homozygous for a recessive allele.

===Resting eggs===
Resting eggs enclose an embryo encysted in a three-layered shell that protects it from external stressors. They are able to remain dormant for several decades and can resist adverse periods (e.g., pond desiccation or presence of antagonists). When favourable conditions return and after an obligatory period of diapause which varies among species, resting eggs hatch releasing diploid amictic females that enter into the asexual phase of the life cycle.

===Anhydrobiosis===
Bdelloid rotifer females cannot produce resting eggs, but many can survive prolonged periods of adverse conditions after desiccation. This facility is termed anhydrobiosis, and organisms with these capabilities are termed anhydrobionts. Under drought conditions, bdelloid rotifers contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water; when rehydrated they resume activity within a few hours. Bdelloids can survive the dry state for long periods, with the longest well-documented dormancy being nine years. Rotifers can also undergo other forms of cryptobiosis, notably cryobiosis which results from decreased temperatures. In 2021, researchers collected samples from remote Arctic locations containing rotifers which when thawed revealed living specimens around 24,000 years old. While in other anhydrobionts, such as the brine shrimp, this desiccation tolerance is thought to be linked to the production of trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide (sugar), bdelloids apparently cannot synthesise trehalose. In bdelloids, a major cause of the resistance to desiccation, as well as resistance to ionizing radiation, is a highly efficient mechanism for repairing the DNA double-strand breaks induced by these agents. This repair mechanism likely involves mitotic recombination between homologous DNA regions.

==Predators==
Rotifers fall prey to many animals, such as copepods, fish (e.g. herring, salmon), bryozoa, comb jellies, jellyfish, starfish, and tardigrades.

==Genome size==
The genome size of a bdelloid rotifer, &quot;Adineta vaga&quot;, was reported to be around 244 Mb. The genomes of Monogononts seem to be significantly smaller than those of Bdelloids. In Monogononta the nuclear DNA content (2C) in eight different species of four different genera ranged almost fourfold, from 0.12 to 0.46 pg. Haploid &quot;1C&quot; genome sizes in &quot;Brachionus&quot; species range at least from 0.056 to 0.416 pg.

<text>Trifle is a layered dessert of English origin. The usual ingredients are a thin layer of sponge fingers or sponge cake soaked in sherry or another fortified wine, a fruit element (fresh or jelly), custard and whipped cream layered in that ascending order in a glass dish. The contents of a trifle are highly variable and many varieties exist, some forgoing fruit entirely and instead using other ingredients, such as chocolate, coffee or vanilla. The fruit and sponge layers may be suspended in fruit-flavoured jelly, and these ingredients are usually arranged to produce three or four layers. The assembled dessert can be topped with whipped cream or, more traditionally, syllabub.

The name &quot;trifle&quot; was used for a dessert like a fruit fool in the sixteenth century; by the eighteenth century, Hannah Glasse records a recognisably modern trifle, with the inclusion of a gelatin jelly.

==History==
Trifle appeared in cookery books in the sixteenth century. The earliest use of the name &quot;trifle&quot; was in a recipe for a thick cream flavoured with sugar, ginger and rosewater, in Thomas Dawson&#x27;s 1585 book of English cookery &quot;The Good Huswifes Jewell&quot;. This flavoured thick cream was cooked &#x27;gently like a custard, and was grand enough to be presented in a silver bowl. These earlier trifles, it is claimed, &#x27;derived from the flavoured almond milk of medieval times&#x27;. Early trifles were, according to food historian Annie Gray, &#x27;more like fools (puréed fruit mixed with sweetened cream)&#x27;. Trifle evolved from these fools, and originally the two names were used interchangeably.

It was not until the 1750s that trifles took the form that many know of today. Two recipes for what now is considered a trifle first appeared in the mid-18th century in England. Both recipes described biscuits soaked in wine layered with custard and covered in a whipped syllabub froth. One was in the 4th edition of Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy&quot; (1751) and the other was by an unknown author entitled &quot;The Whole Duty of a Woman&quot; (1751).

Jelly is first recorded as part of a trifle recipe in Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &#x27;A grand trifle&#x27; in her book The Compleat Confectioner (1760). Her recipe instructs the reader to use calves&#x27; feet to make a rich calves-foot jelly, and to half fill the dish with this jelly. Biscuits and macaroons are broken into pieces and stuck into the jelly before it sets, &#x27;thick sweet cream&#x27; is poured over the jelly and biscuits and the whole is decorated with pieces of calves-foot jelly, raspberry jam and currant jelly cut into pieces, and more macaroons finish the dish.

The Dean&#x27;s Cream from Cambridge, England was made about the same time as Hannah Glasse&#x27;s version and was composed of sponge cakes, spread with jam, macaroons and ratafias soaked in sherry, and covered with syllabub. Trifle-like desserts of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include King&#x27;s Pudding, Easter Pudding, Victoria Pudding or Colchester pudding.

In 1855 Eliza Acton described The Duke&#x27;s Custard, a mixture of sugared, brandied Morella cherries, covered in custard, edged with Naples biscuits (sponge fingers) or macaroons, which was then finished with solid whipped cream coloured pink with cochineal and &#x27;highly flavoured&#x27; with brandy.
The English cookery writer Jane Grigson has a trifle in her book on English Food (first published in 1974) and she describes her version, which includes macaroons, Frontignan wine, brandy, eggs, raspberry jam and everlasting syllabub, as &quot;a pudding worth eating, not the mean travesty made with yellow, packaged sponge cakes, poor sherry and powdered custard&quot;.

The late 19th century was, according to the food historian Annie Gray, &quot;a sort of heyday&quot; for trifles and by the early 1900s there were, in print, says Gray, &quot;a bewildering number of recipes&quot;. There were thirteen in &quot;The Encyclopaedia of Practical Cookery: A Complete Dictionary of All Pertaining to the Art of Cookery and Table Service&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TFG/cdacts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (8 volumes, 1891), from Theodore Francis Garrett, alone. That book is unusual, suggests Gray, in including two savoury versions, one with veal and one with lobster.

In 2022, a trifle was selected to be the Platinum Pudding, to help celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A lemon Swiss roll and amaretti trifle, created by Jemma Melvin from Southport, Merseyside, in the United Kingdom won a competition run by Fortnum &amp; Mason &quot;to create a pudding fit for the Queen&quot;.

Coronation Trifle was created by Adam Handling for the Coronation of King Charles III in 2023. It is made with parkin, ginger custard and strawberry jelly.

==Variations==
Trifles may contain different sorts of alcohol such as port, punsch, raisin wine or curaçao.

==Similar desserts==
The Scots have a similar dish to the trifle, tipsy laird, made with Drambuie or whisky.

In Italy, a dessert similar to and probably based on trifle is known as &quot;zuppa inglese&quot;, literally &quot;English soup&quot;. Tiramisù is prepared similarly to trifle, but it does not include fruits and the original recipe calls for the savoiardi (ladyfingers) to be dipped in coffee rather than spirits.

<doc id="62169" wikidata="Q167821" url="?curid=62169" title="Gore Vidal">
<text>Eugene Luther Gore Vidal ( ; born Eugene Louis Vidal, October 3, 1925 – July 31, 2012) was an American writer and public intellectual known for his acerbic epigrammatic wit. His novels and essays interrogated the social and sexual norms he perceived as driving American life. Vidal was heavily involved in politics, and unsuccessfully sought office twice as a Democratic Party candidate, first in 1960 to the United States House of Representatives (for New York), and later in 1982 to the United States Senate (for California).

A grandson of U.S. Senator Thomas Gore, Vidal was born into an upper-class political family. As a political commentator and essayist, Vidal&#x27;s primary focus was the history and society of the United States, especially how a militaristic foreign policy reduced the country to a decadent empire. His political and cultural essays were published in &quot;The Nation&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot; magazines. As a public intellectual, Gore Vidal&#x27;s topical debates on sex, politics, and religion with other intellectuals and writers occasionally turned into quarrels with the likes of William F. Buckley Jr. and Norman Mailer.

As a novelist, Vidal explored the nature of corruption in public and private life. His style of narration evoked the time and place of his stories, and delineated the psychology of his characters. His third novel, &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; (1948), offended the literary, political, and moral sensibilities of conservative book reviewers, the plot being about a dispassionately presented male homosexual relationship.

In the historical novel genre, Vidal recreated the imperial world of Julian the Apostate (r. AD 361–363) in &quot;Julian&quot; (1964). Julian was the Roman emperor who attempted to re-establish Roman polytheism to counter Christianity. In social satire, &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1968) explores the mutability of gender roles and sexual orientation as being social constructs established by social mores. In &quot;Burr&quot; (1973) and &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1984), both part of his &quot;Narratives of Empire&quot; series of novels, each protagonist is presented as &quot;A Man of the People&quot; and as &quot;A Man&quot; in a narrative exploration of how the public and private facets of personality affect the national politics of the United States.

==Early life==
Vidal was born in the cadet hospital of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, the only child of Eugene Luther Vidal (1895–1969) and Nina S. Gore (1903–1978). Vidal was born there because his father, a U.S. Army officer, was then serving as the first aeronautics instructor at the military academy. The middle name, Louis, was a mistake on the part of his father, &quot;who could not remember, for certain, whether his own name was Eugene Louis or Eugene Luther&quot;. In the memoir &quot;Palimpsest&quot; (1995), Vidal said, &quot;My birth certificate says &#x27;Eugene Louis Vidal&#x27;: this was changed to Eugene Luther Vidal Jr.; then Gore was added at my christening in 1939; then, at fourteen, I got rid of the first two names.&quot;

Vidal was baptized in January 1939, when he was 13 years old, by the headmaster of St. Albans School, where Vidal attended preparatory school. The baptismal ceremony was effected so he &quot;could be confirmed [into the Episcopal faith]&quot; at the Washington Cathedral, in February 1939, as &quot;Eugene Luther Gore Vidal&quot;. He later said that, although the surname &quot;Gore&quot; was added to his names at the time of the baptism, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t named for him [maternal grandfather Thomas Pryor Gore], although he had a great influence on my life.&quot; In 1941, Vidal dropped his two first names, because he &quot;wanted a sharp, distinctive name, appropriate for an aspiring author, or a national political leader ... I wasn&#x27;t going to write as &#x27;Gene&#x27; since there was already one. I didn&#x27;t want to use the &#x27;Jr.

His father, Eugene Luther Vidal Sr., was director (1933–1937) of the Commerce Department&#x27;s Bureau of Air Commerce during the Roosevelt Administration, and was also the great love of the aviator Amelia Earhart. At the U.S. Military Academy, the exceptionally athletic Vidal Sr. had been a quarterback, coach, and captain of the football team; and an all-American basketball player. Subsequently, he competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics and in the 1924 Summer Olympics (seventh in the decathlon, and coach of the U.S. pentathlon). In the 1920s and the 1930s, Vidal Sr. was a founder or executive of three airline companies: the Ludington Line (later Eastern Airlines), Transcontinental Air Transport (later Trans World Airlines), and Northeast Airlines.

Gore&#x27;s great-grandfather Eugen Fidel Vidal was born in Feldkirch, Austria, of Romansh background, and had come to the U.S. with Gore&#x27;s Swiss great-grandmother, Emma Hartmann.

Vidal&#x27;s mother, Nina Gore, was a socialite who made her Broadway theater debut as an extra actress in &quot;Sign of the Leopard&quot;, in 1928. In 1922, Nina married Eugene Luther Vidal Sr. and thirteen years later, in 1935, divorced him. Nina Gore Vidal then was married two more times; to Hugh D. Auchincloss and to Robert Olds. She also had &quot;a long off-and-on affair&quot; with the actor Clark Gable. As Nina Gore Auchincloss, Vidal&#x27;s mother was an alternate delegate to the 1940 Democratic National Convention.

The subsequent marriages of his mother and father yielded four half-siblings for Gore Vidal—Vance Vidal, Valerie Vidal, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and Nina Gore Auchincloss—one step-brother, Hugh D. &quot;Yusha&quot; Auchincloss III from his mother&#x27;s second marriage to Hugh D. Auchincloss, and four step-brothers including Robin Olds from his mother&#x27;s third marriage to Robert Olds, a major general in the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), who died in 1943, 10 months after marrying Nina. Through Auchincloss, Vidal also was the step-brother once removed of Jacqueline Kennedy. The nephews of Gore Vidal include Burr Steers, a writer and film director, and Hugh Auchincloss Steers (1963–1995), a figurative painter.

Raised in Washington, D.C., Vidal attended the Sidwell Friends School and St. Albans School. Given the blindness of his maternal grandfather, Senator Thomas Pryor Gore, of Oklahoma, Vidal read aloud to him, and was his Senate page, and his seeing-eye guide. In 1939, during his summer holiday, Vidal went with some colleagues and a professor from St. Albans School on his first European trip to visit Italy and France. He visited Rome for the first time, the city which came to be &quot;at the center of Gore&#x27;s literary imagination,&quot; and Paris. When the Second World War began in early September, the group was forced to return home early. On his way back, he and his colleagues stopped in Great Britain, where they met the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain, Joe Kennedy (the father of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, later the President of the United States of America). In 1940 he attended the Los Alamos Ranch School and later transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, New Hampshire, where he contributed to the Exonian, the school newspaper.

Rather than attend university, Vidal enlisted in the U.S. Army at age 17 and was assigned to work as an office clerk in the USAAF. Later, Vidal passed the examinations necessary to become a maritime warrant officer (junior grade) in the Transportation Corps, and subsequently served as first mate of the &quot;F.S. 35th&quot;, a US Army Freight and Supply (FS) ship berthed at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. After three years in service, Vidal suffered hypothermia, developed rheumatoid arthritis and, consequently, was reassigned to duty as a mess officer.

==Literary career==
Vidal&#x27;s literary works were influenced by numerous other writers, poets and playwrights, novelists and essayists. These include, from antiquity, Petronius (d. AD 66), Juvenal (AD 60–140), and Apuleius (fl. c. AD 155); and from the post-Renaissance, Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), Thomas Love Peacock (1785–1866), and George Meredith (1828–1909). More recent literary influences included Marcel Proust (1871–1922), Henry James (1843–1916), and Evelyn Waugh (1903–1966). The cultural critic Harold Bloom has written that Vidal believed that his sexuality had denied him full recognition from the literary community in the United States. Bloom himself contends that such limited recognition resulted more from Vidal&#x27;s &quot;best fictions&quot; being &quot;distinguished historical novels&quot;, a subgenre &quot;no longer available for canonization&quot;.

===Fiction===
Vidal&#x27;s literary career began with the success of the military novel &quot;Williwaw&quot;, a men-at-war story derived from his Alaskan Harbor Detachment duty during the Second World War. His third novel, &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; (1948), caused a moralistic furor over his dispassionate presentation of a young protagonist coming to terms with his homosexuality. The novel was dedicated to &quot;J. T.&quot;; decades later, Vidal confirmed that the initials were those of his boyhood friend and St. Albans classmate, James Trimble III, killed in the Battle of Iwo Jima on March 1, 1945, and that Trimble was the only person he ever loved. Critics railed against Vidal&#x27;s presentation of homosexuality in the novel as natural, as it was viewed generally at the time as unnatural and immoral. Vidal claimed that &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Orville Prescott was so offended by the book that he refused to review or to permit other critics to review any book by Vidal. Vidal said that upon publication of the book, an editor at E. P. Dutton told him &quot;You will never be forgiven for this book. Twenty years from now, you will still be attacked for it.&quot; Today, Vidal is often seen as an early champion of sexual liberation.

Vidal took the pseudonym &quot;Edgar Box&quot; and wrote the mystery novels &quot;Death in the Fifth Position&quot; (1952), &quot;Death before Bedtime&quot; (1953) and &quot;Death Likes it Hot&quot; (1954) featuring Peter Cutler Sargeant II, a publicist-turned-private-eye. His satirical novel &quot;Messiah&quot;, detailing the rise of a new nontheistic religion that comes to largely replace the Abrahamic faiths, was also published in 1954. The Edgar Box genre novels sold well and earned the blacklisted Vidal a secret living. That mystery-novel success led Vidal to write in other genres, where he produced the stage play &quot;The Best Man: A Play about Politics&quot; (1960) and the television play &quot;Visit to a Small Planet&quot; (1957). Two early teleplays were &quot;A Sense of Justice&quot; (1955) and &quot;Honor&quot;. He also wrote the pulp novel &quot;Thieves Fall Out&quot; under the pseudonym Cameron Kay but refused to have it reprinted under his real name during his life.

In the 1960s, Vidal published &quot;Julian&quot; (1964), about the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate (r. A.D. 361–363), who sought to reinstate polytheistic paganism when Julian viewed that Christianity threatened the cultural integrity of the Roman Empire; &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot; (1967), about political life during the presidential era of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945); and &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1968), a satire of the American movie business, by way of a school of dramatic arts owned by a transsexual woman, the eponymous anti-heroine.

After publishing the plays &quot;Weekend&quot; (1968) and &quot;An Evening With Richard Nixon&quot; (1972) and the novel &quot;Two Sisters: A Novel in the Form of a Memoir&quot; (1970), Vidal concentrated upon the essay and developed two types of fiction. The first type is about American history, novels specifically about the nature of national politics. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, quoting critic Harold Bloom about those historical novels, said that &quot;Vidal&#x27;s imagination of American politics is so powerful as to compel awe.&quot; The historical novels formed the seven-book series Narratives of Empire: (i) &quot;Burr&quot; (1973), (ii) &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1984), (iii) &quot;1876&quot; (1976), (iv) &quot;Empire&quot; (1987), (v) &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1990), (vi) &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot; (1967), and (vii) &quot;The Golden Age&quot; (2000). Besides U.S. history, Vidal also explored and analyzed the history of the ancient world, specifically the Axial Age (800–200 B.C.), with the novel &quot;Creation&quot; (1981). The novel was published without four chapters that were part of the manuscript he submitted to the publisher; years later, Vidal restored the chapters to the text and republished the novel &quot;Creation&quot; in 2002.

The second type of fiction is the topical satire, such as &quot;Myron&quot; (1974), the sequel to &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot;; &quot;Kalki&quot; (1978), about the end of the world and the consequent ennui; &quot;Duluth&quot; (1983), an alternate universe story; &quot;Live from Golgotha&quot; (1992), about the adventures of Timothy, Bishop of Macedonia, in the early days of Christianity; and &quot;The Smithsonian Institution&quot; (1998), a time-travel story.

===Nonfiction===

In the United States, Vidal is often considered an essayist rather than a novelist. Even the occasionally hostile literary critic, such as Martin Amis, admitted that &quot;Essays are what he is good at ... [Vidal] is learned, funny, and exceptionally clear-sighted. Even his blind spots are illuminating.&quot;

For six decades, Vidal applied himself to socio-political, sexual, historical and literary subjects. In the essay anthology &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1987) he explored the intricacies of power (political and cultural) in the contemporary United States. His criticism of the incumbent U.S. president, Ronald Reagan, as a &quot;triumph of the embalmer&#x27;s art&quot; communicated that Reagan&#x27;s provincial worldview, and that of his administration&#x27;s, was out of date and inadequate to the geopolitical realities of the world in the late twentieth century. In 1993, Vidal won the National Book Award for Nonfiction for the anthology &quot;United States: Essays 1952–92&quot; (1993).

In 2000, Vidal published the collection of essays &quot;The Last Empire&quot;, then such self-described &quot;pamphlets&quot; as &quot;Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace&quot;, &quot;Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta&quot; and &quot;Imperial America&quot;, critiques of American expansionism, the military–industrial complex, the national security state and the George W. Bush administration. Vidal also wrote a historical essay about the Founding Fathers, &quot;Inventing a Nation&quot;. In 1995, he published a memoir, &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, and in 2006 its follow-up volume, &quot;Point to Point Navigation&quot;. Earlier that year, Vidal had published &quot;Clouds and Eclipses: The Collected Short Stories&quot;.

In 2009, Vidal won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation, which called him a &quot;prominent social critic on politics, history, literature and culture&quot;.
In the same year, the Man of Letters Gore Vidal was named honorary president of the American Humanist Association.

===Hollywood===

In 1956, MGM hired Vidal as a screenwriter with a four-year employment contract. In 1958, the director William Wyler required a script doctor to rewrite the screenplay for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), originally written by Karl Tunberg. As one of several script doctors assigned to the project, Vidal rewrote significant portions of the script to resolve ambiguities of character motivation, specifically to clarify the enmity between the Jewish protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur, and the Roman antagonist, Messala, who had been close boyhood friends. In exchange for rewriting the &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; screenplay, on location in Italy, Vidal negotiated the early termination (at the two-year mark) of his four-year contract with MGM.

36 years later, in the documentary film &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot; (1995), Vidal explained that Messala&#x27;s failed attempt at resuming their homosexual, boyhood relationship motivated the ostensibly political enmity between Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd). Vidal said that Boyd was aware of the homosexual subtext to the scene and that the director, the producer and the screenwriter agreed to keep Heston ignorant of the subtext, lest he refuse to play the scene. In turn, on learning of that explanation, Heston said that Vidal had contributed little to the script of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. Despite Vidal&#x27;s resolution of the character&#x27;s motivations, the Screen Writers Guild assigned formal screenwriter-credit to Karl Tunberg, in accordance with the WGA screenwriting credit system, which favored the &quot;original author&quot; of a screenplay, rather than the writer of the filmed screenplay.

Two plays, &quot;The Best Man: A Play about Politics&quot; (1960, made into a film in 1964) and &quot;Visit to a Small Planet&quot; (1955), were theater and movie successes. Vidal occasionally returned to the movie business, and wrote historically accurate teleplays and screenplays about subjects important to him. &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (1989) is one, about William H. Bonney, a gunman in the New Mexico territory Lincoln County War (1878), and later an outlaw in the U.S. Western frontier. Another is 1979&#x27;s &quot;Caligula&quot; (based upon the life of the Roman Emperor Caligula), from which Vidal had his screenwriter credit removed because the producer, Bob Guccione, the director, Tinto Brass, and the leading actor, Malcolm McDowell, rewrote the script to add extra sex and violence to increase its commercial appeal.

In the 1960s, Vidal migrated to Italy, where he befriended the film director Federico Fellini, for whom he appeared in a cameo role in the film &quot;Roma&quot; (1972). He also appeared in the American television series &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; and in the films &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; (1992), a serio-comedy about a reactionary populist politician who manipulates youth culture to win votes; &quot;With Honors&quot; (1994), an Ivy league comedy-drama; &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), a science-fiction drama about genetic engineering; and &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot; (2002), a coming-of-age serio-comedy directed by his nephew, Burr Steers.

==Politics==
===Political campaigns===

Vidal began to drift towards the political left after he received his first paycheck, and realized how much money the government took in tax. He reasoned that if the government was taking so much money, then it should at least provide first-rate healthcare and education.

As a public intellectual, Vidal was identified with the liberal politicians and the progressive social causes of the old Democratic Party.

In 1960, Vidal was the Democratic candidate for Congress for the 29th Congressional District of New York, a usually Republican district that included most of the Catskills and the western bank of the Hudson River, including Newburgh, but lost to the Republican candidate J. Ernest Wharton, by a margin of 57 percent to 43 percent. Campaigning under the slogan of &quot;You&#x27;ll get more with Gore&quot;, Vidal received the most votes any Democratic candidate had received in the district in fifty years and outpolled John F. Kennedy (who lost the district with 38 percent of the vote). Among his supporters were Eleanor Roosevelt and Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, friends who spoke on his behalf.

In 1982, he campaigned against Jerry Brown, the incumbent Governor of California, in the Democratic primary election for the U.S. Senate; Vidal forecast accurately that the opposing Republican candidate (Pete Wilson) would win the election. That foray into senatorial politics is the subject of the documentary film &quot;Gore Vidal: The Man Who Said No&quot; (1983), directed by Gary Conklin.
In a 2001 article, &quot;The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh&quot;, Gore undertook to discover why domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh perpetrated the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. He concluded that McVeigh (a politically disillusioned U.S. Army veteran of the First Iraq War, 1990–91) had destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building as an act of revenge for the FBI&#x27;s Waco massacre (1993) at the Branch Davidian Compound in Texas, believing that the U.S. government had mistreated Americans in the same manner that he believed that the U.S. Army had mistreated the Iraqis. In concluding the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article, Vidal refers to McVeigh as an &quot;unlikely sole mover&quot;, and theorizes that foreign/domestic conspiracies could have been involved.

Vidal was very much against any kind of military intervention in the world. In &quot;Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta&quot; (2002), Vidal drew parallels about how the United States enters wars and said that President Franklin D. Roosevelt provoked Imperial Japan to attack the U.S. to justify the American entry to the Second World War (1939–45). He contended that Roosevelt had advance knowledge of the dawn-raid attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941). In the documentary &quot;Why We Fight&quot; (2005), Vidal said that, during the final months of the war, the Japanese had tried to surrender: &quot;They were trying to surrender all that summer, but Truman wouldn&#x27;t listen, because Truman wanted to drop the bombs ... To show off. To frighten Stalin. To change the balance of power in the world. To declare war on communism. Perhaps we were starting a pre-emptive world war&quot;.

===Criticism of George W. Bush===

As a public intellectual, Vidal criticized what he viewed as political harm to the nation and the voiding of the citizen&#x27;s rights through the passage of the USA Patriot Act (2001) during the George W. Bush administration (2001–2009). He described Bush as &quot;the stupidest man in the United States&quot; and said that Bush&#x27;s foreign policy was explicitly expansionist. He contended that the Bush Administration and their oil-business sponsors, aimed to control the petroleum of Central Asia, after having gained hegemony over the petroleum of the Persian Gulf in 1991.

Vidal became a member of the board of advisors of The World Can&#x27;t Wait, a political organization which sought to publicly repudiate the foreign-policy program of the Bush Administration (2001–2009) and advocated Bush&#x27;s impeachment for war crimes, such as the Second Iraq War (2003–2011) and torturing prisoners of war (soldiers, guerrillas, civilians) in violation of international law.

In May 2007, while discussing 9/11 conspiracy theories that might explain the &quot;who?&quot; and the &quot;why?&quot; of the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., Vidal said

===Political philosophy===

In the &quot;American Conservative&quot; article &quot;My Pen Pal Gore Vidal&quot; (2012), Bill Kauffman reported that Vidal&#x27;s favorite American politician, during his lifetime, was Huey Long (1893–1935), the populist Governor (1928–32) and Senator (1932–35) from Louisiana, who also had perceived the essential, one-party nature of U.S. politics and who was assassinated by a lone gunman called Carl Weiss.

Despite that, Vidal said, &quot;I think of myself as a conservative&quot;, with a proprietary attitude towards the United States. &quot;My family helped start [this country] ... and we&#x27;ve been in political life ... since the 1690s, and I have a very possessive sense about this country&quot;. Based upon that background of populism, from 1970 to 1972, Vidal was a chairman of the People&#x27;s Party of the United States. In 1971, he endorsed the consumer-rights advocate Ralph Nader for U.S. president in the 1972 election. In 2007, he endorsed Democrat Dennis Kucinich in his candidacy for the U.S. presidency (in 2008), because Kucinich was &quot;the most eloquent of the lot&quot; of presidential candidates, from either the Republican or the Democratic parties and that Kucinich was &quot;very much a favorite out there, in the amber fields of grain&quot;.

In a September 30, 2009, interview with &quot;The Times&quot; of London, Vidal said that there soon would be a dictatorship in the United States. The newspaper emphasized that Vidal, described as &quot;the Grand Old Man of American &quot;belles-lettres&quot;&quot;, claimed that America is rotting away – and to not expect Barack Obama to save the country and the nation from imperial decay. In this interview, he also updated his views of his life, the United States, and other political subjects. Vidal had earlier described what he saw as the political and cultural rot in the United States in his essay &quot;The State of the Union&quot; (1975),

==Feuds==
=== The Capote–Vidal feud ===
In 1975, Vidal sued Truman Capote for slander, over the accusation that he had once been thrown out of the White House for being drunk, putting his arm around First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and then insulting her mother. Capote said of Vidal at the time: &quot;I&#x27;m always sad about Gore—very sad that he has to breathe every day.&quot; Mutual friend George Plimpton observed: &quot;There&#x27;s no venom like Capote&#x27;s when he&#x27;s on the prowl—and Gore&#x27;s too, I don&#x27;t know what division the feud should be in.&quot; The suit was settled in Vidal&#x27;s favor when Lee Radziwill refused to testify on Capote&#x27;s behalf, telling columnist Liz Smith, &quot;Oh, Liz, what do we care; they&#x27;re just a couple of fags! They&#x27;re disgusting.&quot;

=== The Buckley–Vidal feud ===
In 1968, the ABC television network hired the liberal Vidal and the conservative William F. Buckley Jr. as political analysts of the presidential-nomination conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties. After days of bickering, their debates deteriorated to vitriolic &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks. During a moment of crosstalk while discussing the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests, the pair argued about freedom of speech; namely, the legality of protesters to display a Viet Cong flag in America, Vidal snapped at Buckley to &quot;shut up a minute&quot;. Moments later, the following exchange transpired: BUCKLEY: Some people were pro-Nazi, and the answer is that they were well treated by people who ostracized them. And I&#x27;m for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers.
VIDAL: As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself. Failing that, I would only say that we can&#x27;t have—
BUCKLEY: Now listen you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi, or I&#x27;ll sock you in your goddamn face, and you&#x27;ll stay plastered. ABC&#x27;s Howard K. Smith intervened, and the debate resumed without violence. Later, Buckley said he regretted having called Vidal a &quot;queer&quot;, but still expressed some distaste for Vidal when he said that he was an &quot;evangelist for bisexuality&quot;.

In 1969, in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, Buckley continued his cultural feud with Vidal in the essay &quot;On Experiencing Gore Vidal&quot; (August 1969), in which he portrayed Vidal as an apologist for homosexuality; Buckley said, &quot;The man who, in his essays, proclaims the normalcy of his affliction [i.e., homosexuality], and in his art the desirability of it, is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher.&quot; The essay is collected in &quot;The Governor Listeth: A Book of Inspired Political Revelations&quot; (1970), an anthology of Buckley&#x27;s writings from the time.

Vidal riposted in &quot;Esquire&quot; with the September 1969 essay &quot;A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley, Jr.&quot; and said that Buckley was &quot;anti-black&quot;, &quot;anti-semitic&quot; and a &quot;warmonger&quot;. Buckley sued Vidal for libel.

The feud continued in &quot;Esquire&quot;, where Vidal implied that in 1944, Buckley and unnamed siblings had vandalized a Protestant church in Sharon, Connecticut (the Buckley family hometown) after the wife of a pastor had sold a house to a Jewish family. Additionally, Vidal later claimed to know for a fact that Buckley was &quot;rather infatuated&quot; with him. Buckley again sued Vidal and &quot;Esquire&quot; for libel and Vidal filed a counterclaim for libel against Buckley, citing Buckley&#x27;s characterization of &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1968) as a pornographic novel. The court dismissed Vidal&#x27;s counterclaim. Buckley accepted a money settlement of $115,000 to pay the fee of his attorney and an editorial apology from &quot;Esquire&quot;, in which the publisher and the editors said that they were &quot;utterly convinced&quot; of the untruthfulness of Vidal&#x27;s assertions. In a letter to &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, the publisher of &quot;Esquire&quot; said that &quot;the settlement of Buckley&#x27;s suit against us&quot; was not &quot;a &#x27;disavowal&#x27; of Vidal&#x27;s article. On the contrary, it clearly states that we published that article because we believed that Vidal had a right to assert his opinions, even though we did not share them.&quot;

In &quot;Gore Vidal: A Biography&quot; (1999), Fred Kaplan said that &quot;The court had &#x27;not&#x27; sustained Buckley&#x27;s case against &quot;Esquire&quot; ... [that] the court had &#x27;not&#x27; ruled that Vidal&#x27;s article was &#x27;defamatory&#x27;. It had ruled that the case would have to go to trial &quot;in order to determine, as a matter of fact, whether or not it was defamatory&quot;. The cash value of the settlement with &quot;Esquire&quot; represented &#x27;only&#x27; Buckley&#x27;s legal expenses.&quot;

In 2003, Buckley resumed his complaint of having been libeled by Vidal, this time with the publication of the anthology &quot;Esquire&#x27;s Big Book of Great Writing&quot; (2003), which included Vidal&#x27;s essay &quot;A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley, Jr.&quot; Again, the offended Buckley filed lawsuit for libel and &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine again settled Buckley&#x27;s claim with $55,000–65,000 for the fees of his attorney and $10,000 for personal damages suffered by Buckley.

In the obituary &quot;RIP WFB – in Hell&quot; (March 20, 2008), Vidal remembered Buckley, who had died on February 27, 2008. Later, in the interview &quot;Literary Lion: Questions for Gore Vidal&quot; (June 15, 2008), &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Deborah Solomon asked Vidal: &quot;How did you feel, when you heard that Buckley died this year?&quot; Vidal responded:
=== The Mailer–Vidal feud ===
On December 15, 1971, during the recording of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, with Janet Flanner, Norman Mailer allegedly head-butted Vidal when they were backstage. When a reporter asked Vidal why Mailer had knocked heads with him, Vidal said, &quot;Once again, words failed Norman Mailer.&quot; During the recording of the talk show, Vidal and Mailer insulted each other, over what Vidal had written about him, prompting Mailer to say, &quot;I&#x27;ve had to smell your works from time to time.&quot; Apparently, Mailer&#x27;s umbrage resulted from Vidal&#x27;s reference to Mailer having stabbed his wife of the time.

==Views==
===Polanski rape case===

In &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine interview &quot;A Conversation with Gore Vidal&quot; (October 2009), by John Meroney, Vidal spoke about topical and cultural matters of U.S. society. Asked his opinion about the arrest of the film director Roman Polanski, in Switzerland, in September 2009, in response to an extradition request by U.S. authorities, for having fled the U.S. in 1978 to avoid jail for the statutory rape of a thirteen-year-old girl in Hollywood, Vidal said: &quot;I really don&#x27;t give a fuck. Look, am I going to sit and weep every time a young hooker feels as though she&#x27;s been taken advantage of?&quot;

Asked for elaboration, Vidal explained the cultural temper of the U.S. and of the Hollywood movie business in the 1970s:
Asked to explain the term &quot;American values&quot;, Vidal replied: &quot;Lying and cheating. There&#x27;s nothing better.&quot;

In response to Vidal&#x27;s opinion about the decades-old Polanski rape case, a spokeswoman for the organization Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, Barbara Dorris, said, &quot;People should express their outrage, by refusing to buy any of his books&quot;, called Vidal a &quot;mean-spirited buffoon&quot; and said that, although &quot;a boycott wouldn&#x27;t hurt Vidal financially&quot;, it would &quot;cause anyone else, with such callous views, to keep his mouth shut, and [so] avoid rubbing salt into the already deep [psychological] wounds of (the victims)&quot; of sexual abuse.

===Scientology===
In 1997, Vidal was one of thirty-four public intellectuals and celebrities who joined a publicity campaign waged by Scientologists against the German government, signing an open letter addressed to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, published in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, alleging that Scientologists in Germany were treated &quot;in the same way that the Nazi regime persecuted the Jews&quot;. Scientologists are free to operate in Germany; the Church of Scientology, however, is not recognized as a religious body but as a business with political goals and thus monitored by the German domestic intelligence service. Despite signing the letter, Vidal was critical of Scientology as a religion.

===Sexuality===
In 1967, Vidal appeared in the CBS documentary &quot;CBS Reports: The Homosexuals&quot;, in which he expressed his views on homosexuality in the arts. Commenting on his life&#x27;s work and his life, he described his style as &quot;knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.&quot;

However, Vidal often rebutted the label of &quot;gay,&quot; maintaining that it referred to sexual acts rather than innate sexuality. During the 1980s and 1990s, he did not express a public stance on the HIV/AIDS crisis. According to Vidal&#x27;s close friend Jay Parini, &quot;Gore didn&#x27;t think of himself as a gay guy. It makes him self-hating. How could he despise gays as much as he did? In my company he always used the term &#x27;fags&#x27;. He was uncomfortable with being gay. Then again, he was wildly courageous.&quot; Biographer Fred Kaplan concluded: &quot;He was not interested in making a difference for gay people, or being an advocate for gay rights. There was no such thing as &#x27;straight&#x27; or &#x27;gay&#x27; for him, just the body and sex.&quot;

In the September 1969 edition of &quot;Esquire&quot;, Vidal wrote about innate bisexuality:
==Personal life==

In the multi-volume memoir &quot;The Diary of Anaïs Nin&quot; (1931–74), Anaïs Nin said she had a love affair with Vidal, who denied her claim in his memoir &quot;Palimpsest&quot; (1995). In the online article &quot;Gore Vidal&#x27;s Secret, Unpublished Love Letter to Anaïs Nin&quot; (2013), author Kim Krizan said she found an unpublished love letter from Vidal to Nin, which contradicts his denial of a love affair with Nin. Krizan said she found the love letter while researching &quot;Mirages&quot;, the latest volume of Nin&#x27;s uncensored diary, to which Krizan wrote the foreword. Vidal would cruise the streets and bars of New York City and other locales and wrote in his memoir that by age twenty-five, he had had more than a thousand sexual encounters. Vidal also said that he had an intermittent romance with actress Diana Lynn, and alluded to possibly having fathered a daughter. He was briefly engaged to actress Joanne Woodward before she married actor Paul Newman; after marrying, they briefly shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles.

Vidal enjoyed telling his sexual exploits to friends. Vidal claimed to have slept with Fred Astaire when he first moved to Hollywood and also with a young Dennis Hopper.

In 1950, Vidal met Howard Austen, who became his romantic partner for the next 53 years, until Austen&#x27;s death. He said that the secret to his long relationship with Austen was that they did not have sex with each other: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to sustain a relationship when sex plays no part, and impossible, I have observed, when it does.&quot; In &quot;&quot; (1995), by Judy Wiedner, Vidal said that he refused to call himself &quot;gay&quot; because he was not an adjective, adding that, &quot;to be categorized is, simply, to be enslaved. Watch out. I have never thought of myself as a victim ... I&#x27;ve said—a thousand times?—in print and on TV, that everyone is bisexual.&quot;

In the course of his life, Vidal lived at various times in Italy and in the United States. In 2003, as his health began to fail with age, he sold his Italian villa &quot;La Rondinaia&quot; (The Swallow&#x27;s Nest) on the Amalfi Coast in the province of Salerno and he and Austen returned to live in their 1929 villa in Outpost Estates, Los Angeles. Howard Austen died in November 2003 and in February 2005 his remains were re-buried at Rock Creek Cemetery, in Washington, D.C., in a joint grave plot that Vidal had purchased for himself and Austen.

==Death==

In 2010, Vidal began to suffer from Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, a neurological disorder caused by his years of alcohol abuse. On July 31, 2012, Vidal died of pneumonia at his home in the Hollywood Hills at the age of 86. A memorial service was held for him at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre in New York City on August 23, 2012. He was buried next to Howard Austen in Rock Creek Cemetery, in Washington, D.C. Vidal said he chose his grave site because it is between the graves of two people who were important in his life: Henry Adams, the historian and writer, whose work Vidal admired; and his boyhood friend Jimmie Trimble who was killed in World War II, a tragedy that haunted Vidal for the rest of his life. Upon his death, Vidal bequeathed the entirety of his estate, valued at $37 million, to Harvard University.

==Legacy==
Postmortem opinions and assessments of Vidal as a writer varied. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;an Augustan figure who believed himself to be the last of a breed, and he was probably right. Few American writers have been more versatile, or gotten more mileage from their talent.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that he was a literary juggernaut whose novels and essays were considered &quot;among the most elegant in the English language&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; described him as a &quot;major writer of the modern era ... [an] astonishingly versatile man of letters&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; said that &quot;Vidal&#x27;s critics disparaged his tendency to formulate an aphorism, rather than to argue, finding in his work an underlying note of contempt for those who did not agree with him. His fans, on the other hand, delighted in his unflagging wit and elegant style.&quot; The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; described the writer as &quot;an icy iconoclast&quot; who &quot;delighted in chronicling what he perceived as the disintegration of civilisation around him&quot;. The BBC News said that he was &quot;one of the finest post-war American writers ... an indefatigable critic of the whole American system ... Gore Vidal saw himself as the last of the breed of literary figures who became celebrities in their own right. Never a stranger to chat shows, his wry and witty opinions were sought after as much as his writing.&quot; In &quot;The Culture of the United States Laments the Death of Gore Vidal&quot;, the Spanish on-line magazine &quot;Ideal&quot; said that Vidal&#x27;s death was a loss to the &quot;culture of the United States&quot; and described him as a &quot;great American novelist and essayist&quot;. In &quot;The Writer Gore Vidal is Dead in Los Angeles&quot;, the online edition of the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; described the novelist as &quot;the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of American culture&quot; and that he was &quot;one of the giants of American literature&quot;. In &quot;Gore Vidal: The Killjoy of America&quot;, the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; said that the public intellectual Vidal was &quot;the killjoy of America&quot; but that he also was an &quot;outstanding polemicist&quot; who used words &quot;like high-precision weapons&quot;.

On August 23, 2012, in the program a &quot;Memorial for Gore Vidal in Manhattan&quot;, the life and works of the writer Gore Vidal were celebrated at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, with a revival of &quot;The Best Man: A Play About Politics&quot; (1960). The writer and comedian Dick Cavett was host of the Vidalian celebration, which featured personal reminiscences about and performances of excerpts from the works of Vidal by friends and colleagues, such as Elizabeth Ashley, Candice Bergen, Hillary Clinton, Alan Cumming, James Earl Jones, Elaine May, Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon, Cybill Shepherd, and Liz Smith.

In the 1960s, Vidal selected the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison to archive his papers, given his early focus on film. In 2002, Vidal transferred his papers to Houghton Library at Harvard University where they are housed to this day.

===In popular culture===
In the 1960s, the weekly American sketch comedy television program &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; featured a running-joke sketch about Vidal; the telephone operator Ernestine (Lily Tomlin) would call him, saying: &quot;Mr. Veedul, this is the Phone Company calling! (snort! snort!).&quot; The sketch, titled &quot;Mr. Veedle&quot;, also appeared in Tomlin&#x27;s comedy record album &quot;This Is a Recording&quot; (1972).

Vidal provided his own voice for the animated-cartoon version of himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Moe&#x27;N&#x27;a Lisa&quot;. He also voiced his animated-cartoon version in &quot;Family Guy&quot;. He was interviewed in the &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;; the Ali G character mistakes him for Vidal Sassoon, a famous hairdresser.

The Buckley-Vidal debates, their aftermath and cultural significance, were the focus of a 2015 documentary film called &quot;Best of Enemies&quot;, as well as a 2021 play by James Graham, inspired by the film.

In season eight, episode eight of &quot;The Office&quot; titled &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, Oscar Martinez calls Dwight Schrute &quot;Gore Vidal&quot; when Dwight tries to explain his version of history naming the &quot;Battle of Schrute Farms&quot; as the northernmost battle in the Civil War. Dwight responds to Oscar that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;know who that is&quot;.

A Netflix biopic titled &quot;Gore&quot; was filmed in 2017. It was directed and co-written by Michael Hoffman, and based on Jay Parini&#x27;s book &quot;Empire of Self, A Life of Gore Vidal&quot;. The film, which starred Kevin Spacey in the title role, was cancelled and remains unreleased due to sexual misconduct allegations made against Spacey.

<text>Crinoids are marine invertebrates that make up the class Crinoidea. Crinoids that remain attached to the sea floor by a stalk in their adult form are commonly called sea lilies, while the unstalked forms, called feather stars or comatulids, are members of the largest crinoid order, Comatulida. Crinoids are echinoderms in the phylum Echinodermata, which also includes the starfish, brittle stars, sea urchins and sea cucumbers. They live in both shallow water and in depths of over .

Adult crinoids are characterised by having the mouth located on the upper surface. This is surrounded by feeding arms, and is linked to a U-shaped gut, with the anus being located on the oral disc near the mouth. Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognised, in most crinoids the five arms are subdivided into ten or more. These have feathery pinnules and are spread wide to gather planktonic particles from the water. At some stage in their lives, most crinoids have a short stem used to attach themselves to the substrate, but many live attached only as juveniles and become free-swimming as adults.

There are only about 700 living species of crinoid, but the class was much more abundant and diverse in the past. Some thick limestone beds dating to the mid-Paleozoic era to Jurassic period are almost entirely made up of disarticulated crinoid fragments.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Crinoidea&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word &quot;&quot; (&quot;krínon&quot;), &quot;a lily&quot;, with the suffix &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;like&quot;.

==Morphology==
The basic body form of a crinoid is a stem (not present in adult feather stars) and a crown consisting of a cup-like central body known as the theca, and a set of five rays or arms, usually branched and feathery. The mouth and anus are both located on the upper side of the theca, making the dorsal (upper) surface the oral surface, unlike in the other echinoderm groups such as the sea urchins, starfish and brittle stars where the mouth is on the underside. The numerous calcareous plates make up the bulk of the crinoid, with only a small percentage of soft tissue. These ossicles fossilise well and there are beds of limestone dating from the Lower Carboniferous around Clitheroe, England, formed almost exclusively from a diverse fauna of crinoid fossils.

The stem of sea lilies is composed of a column of highly porous ossicles which are connected by ligamentary tissue. It attaches to the substrate with a flattened holdfast or with whorls of jointed, root-like structures known as cirri. Further cirri may occur higher up the stem. In crinoids that attach to hard surfaces, the cirri may be robust and curved, resembling birds&#x27; feet, but when crinoids live on soft sediment, the cirri may be slender and rod-like. Juvenile feather stars have a stem, but this is later lost, with many species retaining a few cirri at the base of the crown. The majority of living crinoids are free-swimming and have only a vestigial stalk. In those deep-sea species that still retain a stalk, it may reach up to in length (although usually much smaller), and fossil species are known with stems.

The theca is pentamerous (has five-part symmetry) and is homologous with the body or disc of other echinoderms. The base of the theca is formed from a cup-shaped set of ossicles (bony plates), the calyx, while the upper surface is formed by the weakly-calcified tegmen, a membranous disc. The tegmen is divided into five &quot;ambulacral areas&quot;, including a deep groove from which the tube feet project, and five &quot;interambulacral areas&quot; between them. The mouth is near the centre or on the margin of the tegmen, and ambulacral grooves lead from the base of the arms to the mouth. The anus is also located on the tegmen, often on a small elevated cone, in an interambulacral area. The theca is relatively small and contains the crinoid&#x27;s digestive organs.

The arms are supported by a series of articulating ossicles similar to those in the stalk. Primitively, crinoids had only five arms, but in most modern forms these are divided into two at ossicle II, giving ten arms in total. In most living species, especially the free-swimming feather stars, the arms branch several more times, producing up to two hundred branches in total. Being jointed, the arms can curl up. They are lined, on either side alternately, by smaller jointed appendages known as &quot;pinnules&quot; which give them their feather-like appearance. Both arms and pinnules have tube feet along the margins of the ambulacral grooves. The tube feet come in groups of three of different size; they have no suction pads and are used to hold and manipulate food particles. The grooves are equipped with cilia which facilitate feeding by moving the organic particles along the arm and into the mouth.

===Feeding===

Crinoids are passive suspension feeders, filtering plankton and small particles of detritus from the sea water flowing past them with their feather-like arms. The arms are raised to form a fan-shape which is held perpendicular to the current. Mobile crinoids move to perch on rocks, coral heads or other eminences to maximise their feeding opportunities. The food particles are caught by the primary (longest) tube feet, which are fully extended and held erect from the pinnules, forming a food-trapping mesh, while the secondary and tertiary tube feet are involved in manipulating anything encountered.

The tube feet are covered with sticky mucus that traps any particles which come in contact. Once they have caught a particle of food, the tube feet flick it into the ambulacral groove, where the cilia propel the mucus and food particles towards the mouth. Lappets at the side of the groove help keep the mucus stream in place. The total length of the food-trapping surface may be very large; the 56 arms of a Japanese sea lily with arms, have a total length of including the pinnules. Generally speaking, crinoids living in environments with relatively little plankton have longer and more highly branched arms than those living in food-rich environments.

The mouth descends into a short oesophagus. There is no true stomach, so the oesophagus connects directly to the intestine, which runs in a single loop right around the inside of the calyx. The intestine often includes numerous diverticulae, some of which may be long or branched. The end of the intestine opens into a short muscular rectum. This ascends towards the anus, which projects from a small conical protuberance at the edge of the tegmen. Faecal matter is formed into large, mucous-cemented pellets which fall onto the tegmen and thence the substrate.

=== Predation ===
Specimens of the sea urchin &quot;Calocidaris micans&quot; found in the vicinity of the crinoid &quot;Endoxocrinus parrae&quot;, have been shown to contain large quantities of stem portions in their guts. These consist of articulated ossicles with soft tissue, whereas the local sediment contained only disarticulated ossicles without soft tissue. This makes it highly likely that these sea urchins are predators of the crinoids, and that the crinoids flee, offering part of their stem in the process.

Various crinoid fossils hint at possible prehistoric predators. Coprolites of both fish and cephalopods have been found containing ossicles of various crinoids, such as the pelagic crinoid &quot;Saccocoma&quot;, from the Jurassic lagerstatten Solnhofen, while damaged crinoid stems with bite marks matching the toothplates of coccosteid placoderms have been found in Late Devonian Poland. The calyxes of several Devonian to Carboniferous-aged crinoids have the shells of a snail, &quot;Platyceras&quot;, intimately associated with them. Some have the snail situated over the anus, suggesting that &quot;Platyceras&quot; was a coprophagous commensal, while others have the animal directly situated over a borehole, suggesting a more pernicious relationship.

===Water vascular system===
Like other echinoderms, crinoids possess a water vascular system that maintains hydraulic pressure in the tube feet. This is not connected to external sea water via a madreporite, as in other echinoderms, but only connected through a large number of pores to the coelom (body cavity). The main fluid reservoir is the muscular-walled ring canal which is connected to the coelom by stone canals lined with calcareous material. The coelom is divided into a number of interconnecting spaces by mesenteries. It surrounds the viscera in the disc and has branches within the stalk and arms, with smaller branches extending into the pinnules. It is the contraction of the ring canal that extends the tube feet. Three narrow branches of the coelom enter each arm, two on the oral side and one aborally, and pinnules. The action of cilia cause there to be a slow flow of fluid (1mm per second) in these canals, outward in the oral branches and inward in the aboral ones, and this is the main means of transport of nutrients and waste products. There is no heart and separate circulatory system but at the base of the disc there is a large blood vessel known as the axial organ, containing some slender blind-ended tubes of unknown function, which extends into the stalk.

These various fluid-filled spaces, in addition to transporting nutrients around the body, also function as both a respiratory and an excretory system. Oxygen is absorbed primarily through the tube feet, which are the most thin-walled parts of the body, with further gas exchange taking place over the large surface area of the arms. There are no specialised organs for excretion while waste is collected by phagocytic coelomocytes.

===Nervous system===
The crinoid nervous system is divided into three parts, with numerous connections between them. The oral or uppermost portion is the only one homologous with the nervous systems of other echinoderms. It consists of a central nerve ring surrounding the mouth, and radial nerves branching into the arms and is sensory in function. Below this lies an intermediate nerve ring, giving off radial nerves supplying the arms and pinnules. These nerves are motor in nature, and control the musculature of the tube feet. The third portion of the nervous system lies aborally, and is responsible for the flexing and movement actions of the arms, pinnules and cirri. This is centred on a mass of neural tissue near the base of the calyx, and provides a single nerve to each arm and a number of nerves to the stalk.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
Crinoids are dioecious, with individuals being either male or female. In most species, the gonads are located in the pinnules but in a few, they are located in the arms. Not all the pinnules are reproductive, just those closest to the crown. The gametes are produced in genital canals enclosed in genital coeloms. The pinnules eventually rupture to release the sperm and eggs into the surrounding sea water. In certain genera, such as &quot;Antedon&quot;, the fertilised eggs are cemented to the arms with secretions from epidermal glands; in others, especially cold water species from Antarctica, the eggs are brooded in specialised sacs on the arms or pinnules.

The fertilised eggs hatch to release free-swimming vitellaria larvae. The bilaterally symmetrical larva is barrel-shaped with rings of cilia running round the body, and a tuft of sensory hairs at the upper pole. While both feeding (planktotrophic) and non-feeding (lecithotrophic) larvae exist among the four other extant echinoderm classes, all present day crinoids appear to be descendants from a surviving clade that went through a bottleneck after the Permian extinction, at that time losing the feeding larval stage. The larva&#x27;s free-swimming period lasts for only a few days before it settles on the bottom and attaches itself to the underlying surface using an adhesive gland on its underside. The larva then undergoes an extended period of metamorphoses into a stalked juvenile, becoming radially symmetric in the process. Even the free-swimming feather stars go through this stage, with the adult eventually breaking away from the stalk.

====Regeneration====
Crinoids are not capable of clonal reproduction as are some starfish and brittle stars, but are capable of regenerating lost body parts. Arms torn off by predators or damaged by adverse environmental conditions can regrow, and even the visceral mass can regenerate over the course of a few weeks. The stalk&#x27;s uppermost segment and the basal plates have the capacity to regenerate the entire crown. Nutrients and other components from the stalk, especially the upper 5 cm, are used in crown regeneration.

Crinoids have been able to regenerate parts since Paleozoic times. These regenerative abilities may be vital in surviving attacks by predatory fish.

==Locomotion==
Most modern crinoids, i.e., the feather stars, are free-moving and lack a stem as adults. Examples of fossil crinoids that have been interpreted as free-swimming include &quot;Marsupites&quot;, &quot;Saccocoma&quot; and &quot;Uintacrinus&quot;. In general, crinoids move to new locations by crawling, using the cirri as legs. Such a movement may be induced in relation to a change in current direction, the need to climb to an elevated perch to feed, or because of an agonistic behaviour by an encountered individual. Crinoids can also swim. They do this by co-ordinated, repeated sequential movements of the arms in three groups. At first the direction of travel is upwards but soon becomes horizontal, travelling at about per second with the oral surface in front. Swimming usually takes place as short bursts of activity lasting up to half a minute, and in the comatulid &quot;Florometra serratissima&quot; at least, only takes place after mechanical stimulation or as an escape response evoked by a predator.

In 2005, a stalked crinoid was recorded pulling itself along the sea floor off the Grand Bahama Island. While it has been known that stalked crinoids could move, before this recording the fastest motion known for a stalked crinoid was per hour. The 2005 recording showed one of these moving across the seabed at the much faster rate of per second, or per hour.

==Evolution==
=== Origins ===

If one ignores the enigmatic &quot;Echmatocrinus&quot; of the Burgess Shale, the earliest known unequivocal crinoid groups date back to the Ordovician, 480 million years ago. There are two competing hypotheses pertaining to the origin of the group: the traditional viewpoint holds that crinoids evolved from within the blastozoans (the eocrinoids and their derived descendants, the blastoids and the cystoids), whereas the most popular alternative suggests that the crinoids split early from among the edrioasteroids. The debate is difficult to settle, in part because all three candidate ancestors share many characteristics, including radial symmetry, calcareous plates, and stalked or direct attachment to the substrate.

=== Diversity ===
Echinoderms with mineralized skeletons entered the fossil record in the early Cambrian (540 mya), and during the next 100 million years, the crinoids and blastoids (also stalked filter-feeders) were dominant. At that time, the Echinodermata included twenty taxa of class rank, only five of which survived the mass extinction events that followed. The long and varied geological history of the crinoids demonstrates how well the echinoderms had adapted to filter-feeding.

The crinoids underwent two periods of abrupt adaptive radiation, the first during the Ordovician (485 to 444 mya), and the other during the early Triassic (around 230 mya). This Triassic radiation resulted in forms possessing flexible arms becoming widespread; motility, predominantly a response to predation pressure, also became far more prevalent than sessility. This radiation occurred somewhat earlier than the Mesozoic marine revolution, possibly because it was mainly prompted by increases in benthic predation, specifically of echinoids. There then followed a selective mass extinction at the end of the Permian period, during which all blastoids and most crinoids became extinct. After the end-Permian extinction, crinoids never regained the morphological diversity and dominant position they enjoyed in the Paleozoic; they employed a different suite of ecological strategies open to them from those that had proven so successful in the Paleozoic.

===Fossils===

Some fossil crinoids, such as &quot;Pentacrinites&quot;, seem to have lived attached to floating driftwood and complete colonies are often found. Sometimes this driftwood would become waterlogged and sink to the bottom, taking the attached crinoids with it. The stem of &quot;Pentacrinites&quot; can be several metres long. Modern relatives of &quot;Pentacrinites&quot; live in gentle currents attached to rocks by the end of their stem.

In 2012, three geologists reported they had isolated complex organic molecules from 340-million-year-old (Mississippian) fossils of multiple species of crinoids. Identified as &quot;resembl[ing ...] aromatic or polyaromatic quinones&quot;, these are the oldest molecules to be definitively associated with particular individual fossils, as they are believed to have been sealed inside ossicle pores by precipitated calcite during the fossilization process.

Crinoid fossils, and in particular disarticulated crinoid columnals, can be so abundant that they at times serve as the primary supporting clasts in sedimentary rocks. Rocks of this nature are called encrinites.

== Taxonomy ==


Crinoidea has been accepted as a distinct clade of echinoderms since the definition of the group by Miller in 1821. It includes many extinct orders as well as four closely related living orders (Comatulida, Cyrtocrinida, Hyocrinida, and Isocrinida), which are part of the subgroup Articulata. Living articulates comprise around 540 species.

===Phylogeny===

The phylogeny, geologic history, and classification of the Crinoidea was discussed by Wright et al. (2017). These authors presented new phylogeny-based and rank-based classifications based on results of recent phylogenetic analyses. Their rank-based classification of crinoid higher taxa (down to Order), not fully resolved and with numerous groups &quot;incertae sedis&quot; (of uncertain placement), is illustrated in the cladogram.


== In culture ==
Fossilised crinoid columnal segments extracted from limestone quarried on Lindisfarne, or found washed up along the foreshore, were threaded into necklaces or rosaries, and became known as St. Cuthbert&#x27;s beads in the Middle Ages. Similarly, in the Midwestern United States, fossilized segments of the columns of crinoids are sometimes known as Indian beads. A species of crinoid, &quot;Eperisocrinus missouriensis&quot;, is the state fossil of Missouri. The aliens in the movie franchise &quot;Alien&quot; were inspired by crinoids.

<text>Graptolites are a group of colonial animals, members of the subclass Graptolithina within the class Pterobranchia. These filter-feeding organisms are known chiefly from fossils found from the Middle Cambrian (Miaolingian, Wuliuan) through the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian). A possible early graptolite, &quot;Chaunograptus&quot;, is known from the Middle Cambrian. Recent analyses have favored the idea that the living pterobranch &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot; represents an extant graptolite which diverged from the rest of the group in the Cambrian.

Fossil graptolites and &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot; share a colony structure of interconnected zooids housed in organic tubes (theca) which have a basic structure of stacked half-rings (fuselli). Most extinct graptolites belong to two major orders: the bush-like sessile Dendroidea and the planktonic, free-floating Graptoloidea. These orders most likely evolved from encrusting pterobranchs similar to &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot;. Due to their widespread abundance, planktonic lifestyle, and well-traced evolutionary trends, graptoloids in particular are useful index fossils for the Ordovician and Silurian periods.

The name graptolite comes from the Greek &quot;graptos&quot; meaning &quot;written&quot;, and &quot;lithos&quot; meaning &quot;rock&quot;, as many graptolite fossils resemble hieroglyphs written on the rock. Linnaeus originally regarded them as &#x27;pictures resembling fossils&#x27; rather than true fossils, though later workers supposed them to be related to the hydrozoans; now they are widely recognized as hemichordates.

==History==
The name &quot;graptolite&quot; originates from the genus &quot;Graptolithus&quot; (&quot;writing on the rocks&quot;), which was used by Linnaeus in 1735 for inorganic mineralizations and incrustations which resembled actual fossils. In 1768, in the 12th volume of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, he included &quot;G. sagittarius&quot; and &quot;G. scalaris&quot;, respectively a possible plant fossil and a possible graptolite. In his 1751 &quot;Skånska Resa&quot;, he included a figure of a &quot;fossil or graptolite of a strange kind&quot; currently thought to be a type of &quot;Climacograptus&quot; (a genus of biserial graptolites).

Graptolite fossils were later referred to a variety of groups, including other branching colonial animals such as bryozoans (&quot;moss animals&quot;) and hydrozoans. The term Graptolithina was established by Bronn in 1849, who considered them to represent orthoconic cephalopods. By the mid-20th century, graptolites were recognized as a unique group closely related to living pterobranchs in the genera &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot; and &quot;Cephalodiscus&quot;, which had been described in the late 19th century. &quot;Graptolithus&quot;, as a genus, was officially abandoned in 1954 by the ICZN.

==Morphology==

=== Colony structure ===

Each graptolite colony originates from an initial individual, called the sicular zooid, from which the subsequent zooids will develop. They are all interconnected by stolons, a true colonial system shared by &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot; but not &quot;Cephalodiscus&quot;. These zooids are housed within an organic structure comprising a series of tubes secreted by the glands on the cephalic shield. The colony structure has been known from several different names, including coenecium (for living pterobranchs), rhabdosome (for fossil graptolites), and most commonly tubarium (for both). The individual tubes, each occupied by a single zooid, are known as theca. The composition of the tubarium is not clearly known, but different authors suggest it is made out of collagen or chitin. In some colonies, there are two sizes of theca, the larger autotheca and smaller bitheca, and it has been suggested that this difference is due to sexual dimorphism of zooids within a colony.

Early in the development of a colony, the tubarium splits into a variable number of branches (known as stipes) and different arrangements of the theca, features which are important in the identification of graptolite fossils. Colonies can be classified by their total number of theca rows (biserial colonies have two rows, uniserial have one) and the number of initial stipes per colony (multiramous colonies have many stipes, pauciramous colonies have two or one). Each thecal tube is mostly made up by two series of stacked semicircular half-rings, known as fuselli (sing: fusellum). The fuselli resemble growth lines when preserved in fossils, and the two stacks meet along a suture with a zig-zag pattern. Fuselli are the major reinforcing component of a tubarium, though they are assisted by one or more additional layers of looser tissue, the cortex.

The earliest graptolites appeared in the fossil record during the Cambrian, and were generally sessile animals, with a colony attached to the sea floor. Several early-diverging families were encrusting organisms, with the colony developing horizontally along a substrate. Extant &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot; fall into this category, with an overall encrusting colony form combined with erect, vertical theca. Most of the erect, dendritic or bushy/fan-shaped graptolites are classified as dendroids (order Dendroidea). Their colonies were attached to a hard substrate by their own weight via an attachment disc. Graptolites with relatively few branches were derived from the dendroid graptolites at the beginning of the Ordovician period. This latter major group, the graptoloids (order Graptoloidea) were pelagic and planktonic, drifting freely through the water column. They were a successful and prolific group, being the most important and widespread macroplanktonic animals until they died out in the early part of the Devonian period. The dendroid graptolites survived until the Carboniferous period.

=== Zooids ===
A mature zooid has three important regions, the preoral disc or cephalic shield, the collar and the trunk. In the collar, the mouth and anus (U-shaped digestive system) and arms are found; Graptholitina has a single pair of arms with several paired tentacles. As a nervous system, graptolites have a simple layer of fibers between the epidermis and the basal lamina, also have a &quot;collar ganglion&quot; that gives rise to several nerve branches, similar to the neural tube of chordates. Proper fossils of the soft parts of graptolites have yet to be found, and it is not known if they had pharyngeal gill slits or not, but based on extant &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot;, it is likely that the grapotlite zooids had the same morphology.

== Taxonomy ==

Since the 1970s, as a result of advances in electron microscopy, graptolites have generally been thought to be most closely allied to the pterobranchs, a rare group of modern marine animals belonging to the phylum Hemichordata. Comparisons are drawn with the modern hemichordates &quot;Cephalodiscus&quot; and &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot;. According to recent phylogenetic studies, rhabdopleurids are placed within the Graptolithina. Nonetheless, they are considered an &quot;incertae sedis&quot; family.

On the other hand, Cephalodiscida is considered to be a sister subclass of Graptolithina. One of the main differences between these two groups is that Cephalodiscida species are not colonial organisms. In Cephalodiscida organisms, there is no common canal connecting all zooids. Cephalodiscida zooids have several arms, while Graptolithina zooids have only one pair of arms. Other differences include the type of early development, the gonads, the presence or absence of gill slits, and the size of the zooids. In the fossil record, where mostly tubaria (tubes) are preserved, it is complicated to distinguish between groups.

Graptolithina includes several minor families as well as two main extinct orders, Dendroidea (benthic graptolites) and Graptoloidea (planktic graptolites). The latter is the most diverse, including 5 suborders, where the most assorted is Axonophora (biserial graptolites, etc.). This group includes Diplograptids and Neograptids, groups that had great development during the Ordovician. Old taxonomic classifications consider the orders Dendroidea, Tuboidea, Camaroidea, Crustoidea, Stolonoidea, Graptoloidea, and Dithecoidea but new classifications embedded them into Graptoloidea at different taxonomic levels.

==Ecology==

Graptolites were a major component of the early Paleozoic ecosystems, especially for the zooplankton because the most abundant and diverse species were planktonic. Graptolites were most likely suspension feeders and strained the water for food such as plankton.

Inferring by analogy with modern pterobranchs, they were able to migrate vertically through the water column for feeding efficiency and to avoid predators. With ecological models and studies of the facies, it was observed that, at least for Ordovician species, some groups of species are largely confined to the epipelagic and mesopelagic zone, from inshore to open ocean. Living rhabdopleura have been found in deep waters in several regions of Europe and America but the distribution might be biased by sampling efforts; colonies are usually found as epibionts of shells.

Their locomotion was relative to the water mass in which they lived but the exact mechanisms (such as turbulence, buoyancy, active swimming, and so forth) are not clear yet. One proposal, put forward by Melchin and DeMont (1995), suggested that graptolite movement was analogous to modern free-swimming animals with heavy housing structures. In particular, they compared graptolites to &quot;sea butterflies&quot; (Thecostomata), small swimming pteropod snails. Under this suggestion, graptolites moved through rowing or swimming via an undulatory movement of paired muscular appendages developed from the cephalic shield or feeding tentacles. In some species, the thecal aperture was probably so restricted that the appendages hypothesis is not feasible. On the other hand, buoyancy is not supported by any extra thecal tissue or gas build-up control mechanism, and active swimming requires a lot of energetic waste, which would rather be used for the tubarium construction.

There are still many questions regarding graptolite locomotion but all these mechanisms are possible alternatives depending on the species and its habitat. For benthic species, that lived attached to the sediment or any other organism, this was not a problem; the zooids were able to move but restricted within the tubarium. Although this zooid movement is possible in both planktic and benthic species, it is limited by the stolon but is particularly useful for feeding. Using their arms and tentacles, which are close to the mouth, they filter the water to catch any particles of food.

==Life cycle==
The study of the developmental biology of Graptholitina has been possible by the discovery of the species &quot;R. compacta&quot; and &quot;R. normani&quot; in shallow waters; it is assumed that graptolite fossils had a similar development as their extant representatives. The life cycle comprises two events, the ontogeny and the astogeny, where the main difference is whether the development is happening in the individual organism or in the modular growth of the colony.

The life cycle begins with a planktonic planula-like larva produced by sexual reproduction, which later becomes the &quot;sicular zooid&quot; who starts a colony. In &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot;, the colonies bear male and female zooids but fertilized eggs are incubated in the female tubarium, and stay there until they become larvae able to swim (after 4–7 days) to settle away to start a new colony. Each larva surrounds itself in a protective cocoon where the metamorphosis to the zooid takes place (7–10 days) and attaches with the posterior part of the body, where the stalk will eventually develop.

The development is indirect and lecithotrophic, and the larvae are ciliated and pigmented, with a deep depression on the ventral side. Astogeny happens when the colony grows through asexual reproduction from the tip of a permanent terminal zooid, behind which the new zooids are budded from the stalk, a type of budding called monopodial. It is possible that in graptolite fossils the terminal zooid was not permanent because the new zooids formed from the tip of latest one, in other words, sympodial budding. These new organisms break a hole in the tubarium wall and start secreting their own tube.

==Graptolites in evolutionary development==
In recent years, living graptolites have been used as a hemichordate model for Evo-Devo studies, as have their sister group, the acorn worms. For example, graptolites are used to study asymmetry in hemichordates, especially because their gonads tend to be located randomly on one side. In &quot;Rhabdopleura normani&quot;, the testicle is located asymmetrically, and possibly other structures such as the oral lamella and the gonopore. The significance of these discoveries is to understand the early vertebrate left-right asymmetry due to chordates being a sister group of hemichordates, and therefore, the asymmetry might be a feature that developed early in deuterostomes. Since the location of the structures is not strictly established, also in some enteropneusts, it is likely that asymmetrical states in hemichordates are not under a strong developmental or evolutionary constraint. The origin of this asymmetry, at least for the gonads, is possibly influenced by the direction of the basal coiling in the tubarium, by some intrinsic biological mechanisms in pterobranchs, or solely by environmental factors.

&quot;Hedgehog&quot; (hh), a highly conserved gene implicated in neural developmental patterning, was analyzed in Hemichordates, taking &quot;Rhabdopleura&quot; as a pterobranch representative. It was found that hedgehog gene in pterobranchs is expressed in a different pattern compared to other hemichordates as the enteropneust &quot;Saccoglossus kowalevskii&quot;. An important conserved glycine–cysteine–phenylalanine (GCF) motif at the site of autocatalytic cleavage in hh genes, is altered in &quot;R. compacta&quot; by an insertion of the amino acid threonine (T) in the N-terminal, and in &quot;S. kowalesvskii&quot; there is a replacement of serine (S) for glycine (G). This mutation decreases the efficiency of the autoproteolytic cleavage and therefore, the signalling function of the protein. It is not clear how this unique mechanism occurred in evolution and the effects it has in the group, but, if it has persisted over millions of years, it implies a functional and genetic advantage.

==Geological relevance==

=== Preservation ===
Graptolites are common fossils and have a worldwide distribution. They are most commonly found in shales and mudrocks where sea-bed fossils are rare, this type of rock having formed from sediment deposited in relatively deep water that had poor bottom circulation, was deficient in oxygen, and had no scavengers. The dead planktic graptolites, having sunk to the sea floor, would eventually become entombed in the sediment and were thus well preserved.

These colonial animals are also found in limestones and cherts, but generally these rocks were deposited in conditions which were more favorable for bottom-dwelling life, including scavengers, and undoubtedly most graptolite remains deposited here were generally eaten by other animals.

Fossils are often found flattened along the bedding plane of the rocks in which they occur, though may be found in three dimensions when they are infilled by iron pyrite or some other minerals. They vary in shape, but are most commonly or branching (such as &quot;Dictyonema&quot;), sawblade-like, or &quot;tuning fork&quot;-shaped (such as &quot;Didymograptus murchisoni&quot;). Their remains may be mistaken for fossil plants by the casual observer, as it has been the case for the first graptolite descriptions.

Graptolites are normally preserved as a black carbon film on the rock&#x27;s surface or as light grey clay films in tectonically distorted rocks. The fossil can also appear stretched or distorted. This is due to the strata that the graptolite is within, being folded and compacted. They may be sometimes difficult to see, but by slanting the specimen to the light they reveal themselves as a shiny marking. Pyritized graptolite fossils are also found.

A well-known locality for graptolite fossils in Britain is Abereiddy Bay, Dyfed, Wales, where they occur in rocks from the Ordovician Period. Sites in the Southern Uplands of Scotland, the Lake District and Welsh Borders also yield rich and well-preserved graptolite faunas. A famous graptolite location in Scotland is Dob&#x27;s Linn with species from the boundary Ordovician-Silurian. Since the group had a wide distribution, fossils are also abundant in several parts of the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany and China, among others.

=== Stratigraphy ===
Graptolite fossils have predictable preservation, widespread distribution, and gradual change over a geologic time scale. This allows them to be used to date strata of rocks throughout the world. They are important index fossils for dating Palaeozoic rocks as they evolved rapidly with time and formed many different distinctive species. Geologists can divide the rocks of the Ordovician and Silurian periods into graptolite biozones; these are generally less than one million years in duration. A worldwide ice age at the end of the Ordovician eliminated most graptolites except the neograptines. Diversification from the neograptines that survived the Ordovician glaciation began around 2 million years later.

The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) influenced changes in the morphology of the colonies and thecae, giving rise to new groups like the planktic Graptoloidea. Later, some of the greatest extinctions that affected the group were the Hirnantian in the Ordovician and the Lundgreni in the Silurian, where graptolite populations were dramatically reduced (see also Lilliput effect).

Graptolite diversity was greatly reduced during the Sedgwickii Event in the Aeronian. This event has been attested in locations such as today&#x27;s Canada, Libya as well as in La Chilca Formation of Argentina (then part of Gondwana).

<doc id="62180" wikidata="Q1120277" url="?curid=62180" title="Alice in Wonderland (1933 film)">
<text>Alice in Wonderland is a 1933 American pre-Code fantasy film adapted from the novels by Lewis Carroll. The film was produced by Paramount Pictures, featuring an all-star cast. It is all live action, except for the Walrus and The Carpenter sequence, which was animated by Harman-Ising Studio. The film was seen by Walt Disney, and inspired him to create his company&#x27;s 1951 animated adaptation. 

Stars include W. C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty, Edna May Oliver as the Red Queen, Cary Grant as the Mock Turtle, Gary Cooper as The White Knight, Edward Everett Horton as The Hatter, Charles Ruggles as The March Hare, Richard Arlen as the Cheshire Cat, Baby LeRoy as The Joker, and Charlotte Henry in her first leading role as Alice.

This adaptation was directed by Norman Z. McLeod from a screenplay by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and William Cameron Menzies, based on Lewis Carroll&#x27;s books &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and &quot;Alice Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871). It also drew heavily from Eva Le Gallienne and Florida Friebus&#x27;s then-recent stage adaptation.

When Paramount previewed the film in 1933, the original running time was 90 minutes. By the time it was shown to the press, it was truncated to 77 minutes. Many reviews, including the savage one in &quot;Variety&quot;, made a point of how long it seemed at an hour-and-a-quarter. Though being released at this shorter time, it is often mistakenly reported that Universal Pictures edited it when it bought the television rights in the late 1950s. Universal released the film on DVD on March 2, 2010, as the first home video release.

It is the only major live-action Hollywood theatrical production to adapt the original &quot;Alice&quot; stories. The next major live-action Hollywood production to do so is a two-part adaptation for television in 1985, and the second major live-action Hollywood production for movie theaters to use the title &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was made by Tim Burton for Disney in 2010 as a sequel to the original story.

==Plot==
Alice (Charlotte Henry) and Dinah live peacefully in their home, until chasing a White Rabbit into a hole. Falling in, Alice is transported to various doors. She drinks a bottle that reads &quot;Drink Me, Not Poison&quot;, which makes her grow big. Her tears flood the room while weeping. She eats a cookie and turns tiny. Swimming in her tears, she meets a couple of odd men named Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. She encounters a tea party, where the Mad Hatter and March Hare live. She meets the Cheshire Cat, then she meets Humpty Dumpty, who tells her what an unbirthday is. She leaves and meets a caterpillar and changes size again. Alice returns to her normal size and runs away from the caterpillar and meets the Queen of Hearts. They play croquet by grabbing a flamingo by the neck. Alice is welcomed to a castle, realizing that she is Queen or Princess of the land. The people of Wonderland start to go crazy and gang up on Alice by running towards her, Then Alice gets choked by the Queen, wakes up in the drawing room, and relieved that it was only a dream.

==Reception==

Its status as a box office bomb cast doubt on whether a live-action fantasy with strange-looking characters could be successfully presented on the screen, until MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). It was banned in China under a category of &quot;superstitious films&quot; for its &quot;strangeness&quot; and unscientific elements.

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine said that the timeless classic book is too surrealistic and adult-oriented to have a good film adaptation. It said the film is &quot;vividly realized&quot; with genuine humor and a satisfying literary treatment, and the cast is &quot;a stunning aggregation of screen names&quot;, but the experience is a non-sequitur &quot;volume of separate four-line gags&quot;.

<doc id="62182" wikidata="Q122290" url="?curid=62182" title="Jean-Paul Marat">
<text>Jean-Paul Marat (, , ; born Jean-Paul Mara; 24 May 1743 – 13 July 1793) was a French political theorist, physician, and scientist. A journalist and politician during the French Revolution, he was a vigorous defender of the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, a radical voice, and published his views in pamphlets, placards and newspapers. His periodical &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot; (&quot;The Friend of the People&quot;) made him an unofficial link with the radical Jacobin group that came to power after June 1793.

His journalism was known for its fierce tone and uncompromising stance toward the new leaders and institutions of the revolution. Responsibility for the September massacres has been attributed to him, given his position of renown at the time, and a paper trail of decisions leading up to the massacres. Others posit that the collective mentality which made them possible resulted from circumstances and not from the will of any particular individual. Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday, a Girondin sympathizer, while taking a medicinal bath for his debilitating skin condition. Corday was executed four days later for his assassination, on 17 July 1793.

In death, Marat became an icon to the Montagnards faction of the Jacobins as well as the greater sans-culotte population, and a revolutionary martyr; according to contemporary accounts, some even mourned him with a kind of prayer: &quot;O heart of Jesus! O sacred heart of Marat.&quot; The most famous painter in Paris, Jacques-Louis David, immortalized Marat in his iconic painting &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;. David and Marat were part of the Paris Commune leadership anchored in the Cordeliers section, from where the Revolution is said to have started in 1789 because those who stormed the Bastille lived there. Both David and Marat were on the Commune&#x27;s Committee of General Security during the beginnings of what would become known as the Reign of Terror.

== Early life, education, and early writing ==
===Family===
 Jean-Paul Marat was born in Boudry, in the Prussian Principality of Neuchâtel (now a canton of Switzerland), on 24 May 1743. He was the first of five children born to Jean Mara (born Juan Salvador Mara; 1704–1783), a Sardinian from Cagliari, and Louise Cabrol (1724–1782), from Geneva. His father studied in Spain and Sardinia before becoming a Mercedarian friar in 1720, at age 16, but at some point left the order and converted to Calvinism, and in 1740 immigrated to the Protestant Republic of Geneva. His mother, who had Huguenot background from both sides of her family, was the daughter of French &quot;perruquier&quot; Louis Cabrol, originally from Castres, Languedoc, and Genevan citizen after 1723, and his wife Pauline-Catherine Molinier. Jean Mara and Louise Cabrol married on 19 March 1741 at the parish church of Le Petit-Saconnex, a district of Geneva. One of Marat&#x27;s brothers, David Mara (born in 1756), was a professor at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum in the Russian Empire, where he had Alexander Pushkin as his student.

Marat&#x27;s family lived in moderate circumstances, as his father was well educated but unable to secure a stable profession. Marat credits his father for instilling in him a love of learning. He explains he felt &quot;exceptionally fortunate to have had the advantage of receiving a very careful education in my paternal home.&quot; From his mother, he claims to have been taught a strong sense of morality and social conscience. Marat left home at the age of 16, desiring to seek an education in France. He was aware of the limited opportunities for those seen as outsiders as his highly educated father had been turned down for several college (secondary) teaching posts. In 1754 his family settled in Neuchâtel, capital of the Principality, where Marat&#x27;s father began working as a tutor.

=== Education ===
Marat received his early education in the city of Neuchâtel and there was a student of Jean-Élie Bertrand, who later founded the Société typographique de Neuchâtel. At 17 years of age he applied for the expedition of Jean-Baptiste Chappe d&#x27;Auteroche to Tobolsk to measure the transit of Venus, but was turned down. His first patronage was fulfilled with the wealthy Nairac family in Bordeaux, where he stayed for two years. He then moved to Paris and studied medicine without gaining any formal qualifications. After moving to France, Jean-Paul Mara francized his surname as &quot;Marat&quot;.
He worked, informally, as a doctor after moving to London in 1765 due to a fear of being &quot;drawn into dissipation&quot;. While there he befriended the Royal Academician artist Angelica Kauffman. His social circle included Italian artists and architects who met in coffee houses around Soho. Highly ambitious, but without patronage or qualifications, he set about inserting himself into the intellectual scene.

=== Political, philosophical, and medical writing ===
Around 1770, Marat moved to Newcastle upon Tyne. His first political work, &quot;Chains of Slavery&quot; (1774), inspired by the extra-parliamentary activities of the disenfranchised MP and later Mayor of London John Wilkes, was most probably compiled in the central library there. By Marat&#x27;s own account, while composing it he lived on black coffee for three months and slept two hours a night, and after finishing it he slept soundly for 13 days in a row. He gave it the subtitle, &quot;A work in which the clandestine and villainous attempts of Princes to ruin Liberty are pointed out, and the dreadful scenes of Despotism disclosed.&quot; In the work, Marat criticized aspects of England&#x27;s constitution that he believed to be corrupt or despotic. He condemned the King&#x27;s power to influence Parliament through bribery and attacked limitations on voting rights. &quot;Chains of Slavery&#x27;s&quot; political ideology takes clear inspiration from Jean-Jacques Rousseau by attributing the nation&#x27;s sovereignty to the common people rather than a monarch. He also suggests that the people express sovereignty through representatives who cannot enact legislation without the approval of the people they represent. This work earned him honorary membership of the patriotic societies of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Carlisle and Newcastle. The Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society Library possesses a copy, and Tyne and Wear Archives Service holds three presented to the various Newcastle guilds.

Marat published &quot;A Philosophical Essay on Man,&quot; in 1773 and &quot;Chains of Slavery,&quot; in 1774. Voltaire&#x27;s sharp critique of &quot;De l&#x27;Homme&quot; (an augmented translation, published 1775–76), partly in defence of his protégé Helvétius, reinforced Marat&#x27;s growing sense of a widening gulf between the &quot;philosophes&quot;, grouped around Voltaire on one hand, and their opponents, loosely grouped around Rousseau on the other.

After a published essay on curing a friend of gleets (gonorrhoea) he secured medical &quot;referees&quot; for an MD from the University of St Andrews in June 1775.

He published &quot;Enquiry into the Nature, Cause, and Cure of a Singular Disease of the Eyes&quot; on his return to London. In 1776, Marat moved to Paris after stopping in Geneva to visit his family.

In Paris, his growing reputation as a highly effective doctor along with the patronage of the Marquis de l&#x27;Aubespine (the husband of one of his patients) secured his appointment as physician to the bodyguard of the Comte d&#x27;Artois, Louis XVI&#x27;s youngest brother. He began this position in June 1777. The position paid 2,000 livres a year plus allowances.

==Scientific writing==
Marat set up a laboratory in the Marquise de l&#x27;Aubespine&#x27;s house with funds obtained by serving as court doctor among the aristocracy. His method was to describe in detail the meticulous series of experiments he had undertaken on a problem, seeking to explore and then exclude all possible conclusions but the one he reached.

He published works on fire and heat, electricity, and light. He published a summary of his scientific views and discoveries in &quot;Découvertes de M. Marat sur le feu, l&#x27;électricité et la lumière&quot; (English: &quot;Mr Marat&#x27;s Discoveries on Fire, Electricity and Light&quot;) in 1779. He published three more detailed and extensive works that expanded on each of his areas of research.

=== &quot;Recherches Physiques sur le Feu&quot; ===
The first of Marat&#x27;s large-scale publications detailing his experiments and drawing conclusions from them was &quot;Recherches Physiques sur le Feu&quot; (English: &quot;Research into the Physics of Fire&quot;), which was published in 1780 with the approval of the official censors.

This publication describes 166 experiments conducted to demonstrate that fire was not, as was widely held, a material element but an &quot;igneous fluid.&quot; He asked the Academy of Sciences to appraise his work, and it appointed a commission to do so, which reported in April 1779. The report avoided endorsing Marat&#x27;s conclusions but praised his &quot;new, precise and well-executed experiments, appropriately and ingeniously designed&quot;. Marat then published his work, with the claim that the Academy approved of its contents. Since the Academy had endorsed his methods but said nothing about his conclusions, this claim drew the ire of Antoine Lavoisier, who demanded that the Academy repudiate it. When the Academy did so, this marked the beginning of worsening relations between Marat and many of its leading members. A number of them, including Lavoisier himself, as well as Condorcet and Laplace, took a strong dislike to Marat. However, Lamarck and Lacépède wrote positively about Marat&#x27;s experiments and conclusions.

=== &quot;Découvertes sur la Lumière&quot; ===
In Marat&#x27;s time, Newton&#x27;s views on light and colour were regarded almost universally as definitive, yet Marat&#x27;s explicit purpose in his second major work &quot;Découvertes sur la Lumière&quot; (&quot;Discoveries on Light&quot;) was to demonstrate that in certain key areas, Newton was wrong.

The focus of Marat&#x27;s work was the study of how light bends around objects, and his main argument was that while Newton held that white light was broken down into colours by refraction, the colours were actually caused by diffraction. When a beam of sunlight shone through an aperture, passed through a prism and projected colour onto a wall, the splitting of the light into colours took place not in the prism, as Newton maintained, but at the edges of the aperture itself. Marat sought to demonstrate that there are only three primary colours, rather than seven as Newton had argued.

Once again, Marat requested the Academy of Sciences review his work, and it set up a commission to do so. Over a period of seven months, from June 1779 to January 1780, Marat performed his experiments in the presence of the commissioners so that they could appraise his methods and conclusions. The drafting of their final report was assigned to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy. The report was finally produced after many delays in May 1780, and consisted of just three short paragraphs. Significantly, the report concluded that &quot;&quot;these experiments are so very numerous...[but]...they do not appear to us to prove what the author believes they establish&quot;.&quot; The Academy declined to endorse Marat&#x27;s work. When it was published, &quot;Découvertes sur la lumière&quot; did not carry the royal approbation. According to the title page, it was printed in London, so that either, Marat could not get the official censor to approve it, or, he did not want to spend the time and effort to do so.

=== &quot;Recherches Physiques sur L&#x27;Électricité&quot; ===
Marat&#x27;s third major work, &quot;Recherches Physiques sur l&#x27;Électricité&quot; (English: &quot;Research on the Physics of Electricity&quot;), outlined 214 experiments. One of his major areas of interest was in electrical attraction and repulsion. Repulsion, he held, was not a basic force of nature. He addressed a number of other areas of enquiry in his work, concluding with a section on lightning rods which argued that those with pointed ends were more effective than those with blunt ends, and denouncing the idea of &quot;earthquake rods&quot; advocated by Pierre Bertholon de Saint-Lazare. This book was published with the censor&#x27;s stamp of approval, but Marat did not seek the endorsement of the Academy of Sciences.

In April 1783, he resigned his court appointment and devoted his energies full-time to scientific research. Apart from his major works, during this period Marat published shorter essays on the medical use of electricity (&quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;électricité médicale&quot; (1783)) and on optics (&quot;Notions élémentaires d&#x27;optique&quot; (1784)). He published a well-received translation of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot; (1787), which was still in print until recently, and later a collection of essays on his experimental findings, including a study on the effect of light on soap bubbles in his &quot;Mémoires académiques, ou nouvelles découvertes sur la lumière&quot; (&quot;Academic memoirs, or new discoveries on light&quot;, 1788). Benjamin Franklin visited him on several occasions and Goethe described his rejection by the Academy as a glaring example of scientific despotism.

==Other pre-Revolutionary writing==
In 1780, Marat published his &quot;favourite work,&quot; a &quot;Plan de législation criminelle.&quot; It was a polemic for penal reform which had been entered into a competition announced by the Berne Economic Society in February 1777 and backed by Frederick the Great and Voltaire. Marat was inspired by Rousseau and Cesare Beccaria&#x27;s &quot;Il libro dei delitti e delle pene&quot;.

Marat&#x27;s entry contained many radical ideas, including the argument that society should provide fundamental natural needs, such as food and shelter, if it expected all its citizens to follow its civil laws, that the king was no more than the &quot;first magistrate&quot; of his people, that there should be a common death penalty regardless of class, and that each town should have a dedicated &quot;&quot;avocat&quot; &quot;des&quot; pauvres&quot; and set up independent criminal tribunals with twelve-man juries to ensure a fair trial.

== In the early French Revolution ==

=== Estates General and Fall of the Bastille ===

In 1788, the Assembly of Notables advised Louis XVI to assemble the Estates-General for the first time in 175 years. According to Marat, in the latter half of 1788 he had been deathly ill. Upon hearing of the King&#x27;s decision to call together the Estates General, however, he explains that the &quot;news had a powerful effect on me; my illness suddenly broke and my spirits revived&quot;. He strongly desired to contribute his ideas to the coming events and subsequently abandoned his career as a scientist and doctor, taking up his pen on behalf of the Third Estate.

Marat anonymously published his first contribution to the revolution in February 1789, titled &quot;Offrande à la Patrie&quot; (&quot;Offering to the Nation&quot;), which touched on some of the same points as the Abbé Sieyès&#x27; famous &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que le Tiers État?&quot; (&quot;What is the Third Estate?&quot;). Marat claimed that this work caused a sensation throughout France, though he likely exaggerated its effect as the pamphlet mostly echoed ideas similar to many other pamphlets and cahiers circulating at the time. This was followed by a &quot;Supplément de l&#x27;Offrande&quot; in March, where he was less optimistic, expressing displeasure with the King&#x27;s &quot;Lettres Royales&quot; of 24 January. In August 1789, he published &quot;La Constitution, ou Projet de déclaration des droits de l&#x27;homme et du citoyen&quot;, intended to influence the drafting of France&#x27;s new constitution, then being debated in the National Assembly. In this work, he builds his theories upon ideas taken from Montesquieu and Rousseau, claiming that the sovereignty of the nation rests with the people and emphasizing the need for a separation of powers. He argues for a constitutional monarchy, believing that a republic is ineffective in large nations. Marat&#x27;s work elicited no response from the National Assembly.

On 14 July, three days after Louis XVI dismissed Jacques Necker as his financial advisor, enraged Parisians attacked the Hotel des Invalides and the Bastille, marking the first insurrection of the French Revolution. Marat was not directly involved in the Fall of the Bastille but sought to glorify his role that day by claiming that he had intercepted a group of German soldiers on Pont Neuf. He claims that these soldiers were seeking to crush the revolution in its infancy, and that he had successfully convinced a crowd to force the soldiers to surrender their weapons. Whether or not this event actually occurred is questionable as there are no other known accounts that confirm Marat&#x27;s story.

=== &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot; ===
On 12 September 1789, Marat began his own newspaper, entitled &quot;Publiciste parisien&quot;, before changing its name four days later to &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s friend&quot;). From this position, he often attacked the most influential and powerful groups in Paris as conspirators against the Revolution, including the Commune, the Constituent Assembly, the ministers, and the Châtelet. In January 1790, he moved to the radical Cordeliers section, then under the leadership of the lawyer Danton, was nearly arrested for his attacks against Jacques Necker, Louis XVI&#x27;s popular Finance Minister, and was forced to flee to London. In May, he returned to Paris to continue publication of &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot; and briefly ran a second newspaper in June 1790 called &quot;Le&quot; &quot;Junius&quot; &quot;français&quot; named after the notorious English polemicist Junius. Marat faced the problem of counterfeiters distributing falsified versions of &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot;. This led him to call for police intervention, which resulted in the suppression of the fraudulent issues, leaving Marat the continuing sole author of &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot;.

During this period, Marat made regular attacks on the more conservative revolutionary leaders. In a pamphlet from 26 July 1790, entitled &quot;C&#x27;en est fait de nous&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;re done for!&quot;), he warned against counter-revolutionaries, advising, &quot;five or six hundred heads cut off would have assured your repose, freedom and happiness.&quot;

Between 1789 and 1792, Marat was often forced into hiding, sometimes in the Paris sewers, where he almost certainly aggravated his debilitating chronic skin disease (possibly dermatitis herpetiformis). In January 1792, he married the 26-year-old Simonne Évrard in a common-law ceremony on his return from exile in London, having previously expressed his love for her. She was the sister-in-law of his typographer, Jean-Antoine Corne, and had lent him money and sheltered him on several occasions.

Marat only emerged publicly on the 10 August insurrection, when the Tuileries Palace was invaded and the royal family forced to shelter within the Legislative Assembly. The spark for this uprising was the Brunswick Manifesto, which called for the crushing of the Revolution and helped to inflame popular outrage in Paris.

==Committee on Surveillance==
As the Paris Commune of Marat&#x27;s allies achieved more influence, it formed a Committee on Surveillance which included Marat, Jacque-Nicolas Billaud-Varennes, Jean-Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois, Georges Danton, Jean-Lambert Tallien, Panis and David. Marat was said by Stanley Loomis to have claimed the position of its head. Ernest Belfort Bax disputed this claim, saying that on appearing once again in the upper daylight of Paris, Marat was almost immediately invited to assist the new governing body with his advice, and had a special tribune assigned to him. Marat was thus assiduous in his attendance at the Commune, although never formally a member. The Commune and the Sections of Paris, between them, had established a &quot;Comité de Surveillance&quot;, with power to add to its numbers. Into this committee Marat was, according to Bax, co-opted. They quickly decided to round up those they believed were &quot;suspect&quot;; the Committee voted to do so and four thousand were sent into the prisons by late August 1792. Actually the Committee, of which Marat was one of the most influential members, took the step of withdrawing from the prisons those of whose guilt, in its opinion, there was any reasonable doubt. Marat and the rest saw what was coming; the last straw to break the patience of Paris was the acquittal on Friday 31 August of Montmarin, the late Governor of Fontainebleau. Montmarin was notoriously and openly a courtier, who wished to see the allies in Paris, and his royal master reinstated, and who was proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt, to have been actively engaged in plotting to this end; yet, on being brought to trial, he was acquitted, and, as if to lend emphasis to the acquittal, the judge himself, descending from the bench, gave him his arm as he walked out of court. An unsuccessful attempt was even made to deprive the Commune of its powers. Forty-eight hours later, the notorious September massacres began.

Those arrangements would include a collection of mercenaries grouped as &quot;Marsellais&quot; though they were &quot;foreign vagabonds, dregs of all nations, Genosee, Corsicans and Greeks led by a Pole named Lazowski.&quot; Added to these were convicted murderers and those imprisoned for other violent crimes, released in time to join the &quot;Marsellais&quot; at the center of the bloodlettings. At times those enacting violence were joined by mobs of locals, some of who had armed themselves in preparation for a defense of the city National Guardsmen and some &quot;fédérés&quot;. In some cases makeshift &quot;courts&quot; were set-up, prisoners were pronounced &quot;free&quot; or &quot;guilty&quot; then all were led to a central courtyard where they were bludgeoned, hacked, speared, and decapitated. In other prisons, small bands of mercenaries entered cells which had held murderers days before, who turned their craft on the innocents brought in by the Committee, some as young as 10.

On 3 September, the second day of the massacres, the Committee of Surveillance of the Commune published a circular that called on provincial Patriots to defend Paris and asked that, before leaving their homes, they eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Authored by Marat as head of the Committee, signed by him and circulated to the provinces, it hailed the rounding up and killing of political enemies going on in Paris as a model for the provinces. While Georges Lefebvre maintained collective mentality was sufficient explanation for the mass killing, Stanley Loomis says this &quot;is their excuse or justification&quot;.

The Girondins then made a number of copies of this circular, but there is no evidence that it had any effect. Marat himself did not participate in the violence of the massacres, but rather the Sections of Paris had begun to act of themselves. Marat and his Committee of Supervision at most took the control of the movement which had already begun spontaneously. Whether Marat played a part in the cause of the massacres is still continually debated. It can be said that there was a continuous goading on of the tribunals to definite and decided action. In No. 679 of &quot;L&#x27;Ami du Peuple&quot; we have the following advice: Guard the King from view, put a price on the heads of the fugitive Capets, arm all the citizens, form a camp near Paris, press forward the sale of the goods of the ‘emigrants,’ and recompense the unfortunates who have taken part in the conquest of the Tuileries, invite the troops of the line to name their officers, guard the provisions, do not miss a word of this last advice, press the judgment of the traitors imprisoned in the Abbaye; ... if the sword of justice do at last but strike conspirators and prevaricators, we shall no longer hear popular executions spoken of, cruel resource which the law of necessity can alone commend to a people reduced to despair, but which the voluntary sleep of the laws always justifies. Danton at the same moment was urging from the tribune the necessity of the prompt appointment of a court to try traitors, as the only alternative to the popular justice of the streets. Maximilien Robespierre, Danton and Marat all stressed the necessity of a tribunal that would judge these crimes. Robespierre intervened on 15 August, as a delegate of the Commune, and proclaimed: &quot;Since 10 August, the just vengeance of the people has not yet been satisfied.&quot; According to Bax, the September massacres were the result of the efforts of the Moderate party to screen men who were openly plotting the overthrow of the Revolution. The Moderatist and Girondist Assembly hesitated at making a few examples of even the most notorious of these plotters. The crisis in the war, long foreseen by Marat and others, was now becoming more acute every day. On 6 September, Mlle de Mareuil, daughter of a member of the Commune&#x27;s general council, wrote to her brother: I have to make the following remark: since the journée of 10 August, there have only been three people guillotined, and this has revolted the people. Finally people gathered from all sides... Oh my dear friend, we are all in a state of dreadful consternation.There is an exculpatory article in No.12 of Marat&#x27;s &quot;Journal de la République&quot;, occasioned by the virulent attacks of the Girondins in the Convention on the Commune, the Committee of Supervision, and above all on Marat himself, with reference to the massacres:The disastrous events of the 2nd and 3rd of September, which perfidious and venal persons attribute to the Municipality, has been solely promoted by the denial of justice on the part of the Criminal tribunal which whitewashed the conspirator Montmarin, by the protection thus proclaimed to all others conspirators, and by the indignation of the people, fearing to find itself the slave of all the traitors who have for so long abused its misfortunes and its disasters. They call those brigands who massacred the traitors and scoundrels confined in the prisons. If that were so, Pétion would be criminal for having peaceably left brigands to perpetrate their crimes during two consecutive days in all the prisons of Paris. His culpable inaction would be the most serious crime, and he would merit the loss of his head for not having mobilised his whole armed force to oppose them. He will doubtless tell you, in order to exculpate himself, that the armed force would not have obeyed him, and that all Paris was involved, which is indeed a fact. Let us agree, then, that it is an imposture to make brigands responsible for an operation unhappily only too necessary. It is then because the conspirators have escaped the sword of justice that they have fallen under the axe of the people. Is it necessary to say more to refute the dishonest insinuation, which would make the Committee of Supervision of the Commune responsible for these popular executions? But its justification does not end there. We shall see what the principal members of this Committee have done to prevent any innocent person, any debtor, any one culpable of a trivial offence, being involved in the dangers which threatened great criminals. I was at the Committee of Supervision, when the announcement was made that the people had just seized from the hands of the Guard, and put to death, several refractory priests, accused of plotting, destined by the Committee for La Force, and that the people threatened to enter the prisons. At this news, Panis and myself exclaimed together, as if by inspiration, &quot;Save the small delinquents, the poor debtors, those accused of trivial assaults!&quot; The Committee immediately ordered the different jailers to separate these from the serious malefactors and the counter-revolutionary traitors, lest the people should be exposed to the risk of sacrificing some innocent persons. The separation was already made when the prisons were forced, but the precaution was unnecessary, owing to the care taken by the judges appointed by the people, who exercised the functions of tribunes during the expedition, to inquire into each case and to release all those whom the Committee of Supervision had separated. This is a discrimination the despot would certainly not have exercised had he triumphed on the 10th of August. Such are the facts which oppose themselves to the calumny that has distorted the narrative of the events of the 2nd and 3rd of September.The September massacres were not the work of one party, much less of one man, but an ebullition of popular fury, acquiesced in as a necessity by all parties and by all the leading men of the Revolution. This perspective of affairs is summed up in the passages of Mr. Bowen-Graves quoted by Ernest Belfort Bax:Marat&#x27;s part in these last terrible events has been constantly and grossly misrepresented. He had long foreseen and foretold what would happen if foreign invasion found Paris in a state of chaos. The predicted crisis had now arrived. On the east the Germans are at the Thermopylae of France. A step more, the Revolution sinks beneath them. On the west the standard of the Vendean insurrection is already raised. Between the two lies Paris, in hardly dormant civil war. Royalty is overthrown, but royalism is rampant. The Swiss guards, the rank and file have fallen, sacrificed to their fidelity to a master who had deserted and forgotten them; but officers, courtiers, &quot;chevaliers de poignard&quot;, are lively as ever, intriguing, plotting, vapouring in street and café, openly rejoicing in the triumph which German armies will give them measuring, compasses in hand, the distance between Verdun and Paris. The newly-formed tribunal is inefficient, acquitting men, notorious for their part in the intrigues, which were the cause of all the evil. Lafayette, with his army, is believed to be marching on Paris to restore the monarchy. Republicans knew well enough what such restoration would mean. The horrors of Montauban, Arles, and Avignon are written in history, to show how well-founded were their fears. And in the midst of all this came the tidings that the one strong place between Paris and the enemy is besieged; that its resistance is a question hardly even of days. Then, while the tocsin was clanging, and the alarm cannon roaring, and the Girondin minister could find nothing better to suggest, with his unseasonable classicism, than carrying into the South the statue of liberty, Paris answered with one instinct to Danton&#x27;s thundering defiance, and perpetrated that tremendous act of self-defence at which we shudder to this day. The reaction hid its head and cowered; and within the month the ragged volunteers of the Republic were hurling back from the passes of the Argonne the finest soldiery which Europe could produce.On 2 September, news arrived in Paris that the army of the Duke of Braunschweig had invaded France and the fortress of Verdun had quickly fallen, and that the Prussians were rapidly advancing towards the capital. This information ignited anger and fear among the population. Parisians knew that an illumination had been staged at the Abbay prison on the day of the capture of Longwy, where behind bars the prisoners insulted passers-by and assured them that the Prussians would occupy Paris and destroy it. That the Parisians&#x27; hatred of the Royalists was founded can be deduced from an article published in a Girondist newspaper on 2 September stating that the Royalists decided to burn the city on all sides after the Prussian army entered Paris, starved the city population and punished the revolutionaries. And the Manifesto of the Duke of Braunschweig (25 July 1792), written in large part by Louis XVI&#x27;s cousin Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, leader of a large contingent of immigrants in the Allied army, threatened the French people with instant punishment if the people resists the imperial and Prussian armies and the re-establishment of a monarchy. The days of September in Paris were seen by some as the act of self-defense of a people who knew how brutal the counter-revolutionaries were, a people who feared a coup in Paris while fighting on the front lines. After the capture of Verdun, the Prussian army was only a hundred miles from Paris. Many Europeans had no doubt about the victory of the Duke of Braunschweig. A fall of Paris was not expected later than 10 September.
In the &quot;Créole patriote&quot; for 2 September, the account began by evoking 10 August: &#x27;The people, justly indignant at the crimes committed during the journée of 10 August, made for the prisons. They still feared plots and traitors... The news that Verdun had been taken... provoked their resentment and vengeance.’

It was enough for the Legislative Assembly, at the vigorous request of the Commune, to issue a statement to the French people on 4 September in which it promised &quot;that it would fight with all its powers against the king and the royal government&quot; so that the slaughter would end the same day and Parisians would go to the front. The Battle of Valmy (20 September 1792) was the first victory over their enemy since the beginning of the war. Johann Wolfgang van Goethe, an admirer of the scientific work of Dr. Marat, said, &quot;At that place, on that day, a new era in world history began. It is the first victory of the people over the kings.&quot; No one was prosecuted for the killings.

==National Convention==

Marat was elected to the National Convention in September 1792 as one of 26 Paris deputies, although he belonged to no party. When France was declared a republic on 22 September, Marat renamed his &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot; as &quot;Le Journal de la République française&quot; (&quot;Journal of the French Republic&quot;).
His stance during the trial of the deposed king Louis XVI was unique. He declared it unfair to accuse Louis of anything before his acceptance of the French Constitution of 1791, and although implacably, he said, believing that the monarch&#x27;s death would be good for the people, defended Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, the King&#x27;s counsel, as a &quot;sage et respectable vieillard&quot; (&quot;wise and respected old man&quot;).

On 21 January 1793, Louis XVI was guillotined, which caused political turmoil. From January to May, Marat fought bitterly against the Girondins, whom he believed to be covert enemies of republicanism. Marat&#x27;s hatred and suspicion of the Girondins became increasingly heated which led him to call for the use of violent tactics against them. He cried that France needed a chief, &quot;a military Tribune&quot;. The Girondins fought back and demanded that Marat be tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal. After trying to avoid arrest for several days, Marat was finally imprisoned. On 24 April, he was brought before the Tribunal on the charges that he had printed in his paper statements calling for widespread murder as well as the suspension of the Convention. Marat decisively defended his actions, stating that he had no evil intentions directed against the Convention. Marat was acquitted of all charges to the celebration of his supporters.

==Assassination==
The fall of the Girondins on 2 June, helped by the actions of François Hanriot, the new leader of the National Guard, was one of Marat&#x27;s last achievements. Forced to retire from the Convention due to his worsening skin disease, he continued to work from home, where he soaked in a medicinal bath. Now that the Montagnards no longer needed his support in the struggle against the Girondins, Robespierre and other leading Montagnards began to separate themselves from him, while the Convention largely ignored his letters.
Marat was in his bathtub on 13 July when a young woman from Caen, Charlotte Corday, appeared at his flat, claiming to have vital information on the activities of the escaped Girondins who had fled to Normandy. Despite his wife Simone&#x27;s protests, Marat asked for her to enter and gave her an audience by his bath, over which a board had been laid to serve as a writing desk. Their interview lasted around fifteen minutes. He asked her what was happening in Caen and she explained, reciting a list of the offending deputies. After he had finished writing out the list, Corday claimed that he told her, &quot;Their heads will fall within a fortnight,&quot; a statement she later changed at her trial to, &quot;Soon I shall have them all guillotined in Paris.&quot; This was unlikely since Marat did not have the power to have anyone guillotined. At that moment, Corday rose from her chair, drawing out from her corset a kitchen knife, which she had bought earlier that day, and brought it down into Marat&#x27;s chest, where it pierced just under his right clavicle, opening the brachiocephalic artery, close to the heart. The massive bleeding was fatal within seconds. Slumping backwards, Marat cried out his last words to Simone, &quot;Aidez-moi, ma chère amie!&quot; (&quot;Help me, my beloved!&quot;) and died.

Corday was a Girondin sympathizer who came from an impoverished royalist family; her brothers were émigrés who had left to join the exiled royal princes. From her own account, and those of witnesses, it is clear that Girondin speeches had inspired her to a hatred of the Montagnards and their excesses, symbolised most powerfully in the character of Marat. The &quot;Book of Days&quot; claims the motive was to &quot;avenge the fate of her friend, Barbaroux&quot;. Marat&#x27;s assassination contributed to the mounting suspicion which fed the Terror during which thousands of the Jacobins&#x27; adversaries – both royalists and Girondins – were executed on charges of treason. Charlotte Corday was guillotined on 17 July 1793 for the murder. During her four-day trial, she testified that she had carried out the assassination alone, saying &quot;I killed one man to save 100,000.&quot;

===Memory in the Revolution===
Marat&#x27;s assassination led to his apotheosis. The painter Jacques-Louis David, a member of one of the two &quot;Great Committees&quot; (the Committee of General Security), was asked to organise a grand funeral. David was also asked to paint Marat&#x27;s death, and took up the task of immortalising him in the painting &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;. The extreme decomposition of Marat&#x27;s body made any realistic depiction impossible, and David&#x27;s work beautified the skin that was discoloured and scabbed from his chronic skin disease in an attempt to create antique virtue. The resulting painting is thus not an accurate representation of Marat&#x27;s death. As a result of this work, David was later criticised as glorifying the Jacobin&#x27;s death.

The entire National Convention attended Marat&#x27;s funeral, and he was buried under a weeping willow in the garden of the former &quot;Club des Cordeliers&quot; (former &quot;Couvent des Cordeliers&quot;). After Marat&#x27;s death, he was viewed by many as a martyr for the revolution, and was immortalized in various ways to preserve the values he stood for. His heart was embalmed separately and placed in an urn in an altar erected to his memory at the &quot;Cordeliers&quot; to inspire speeches that were similar in style to Marat&#x27;s journalism. On his tomb, the inscription on a plaque read, &quot;Unité, Indivisibilité de la République, Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité ou la mort.&quot; His remains were transferred to the Panthéon on 21 September 1794 and his near messianic role in the Revolution was confirmed with the elegy: &quot;Like Jesus, Marat loved ardently the people, and only them. Like Jesus, Marat hated kings, nobles, priests, rogues and, like Jesus, he never stopped fighting against these plagues of the people.&quot; The eulogy was given by the Marquis de Sade, delegate of the Section Piques and an ally of Marat&#x27;s faction in the National Convention.
On 19 November, the port city of Le Havre-de-Grâce changed its name to Le Havre-de-Marat and then Le Havre-Marat. When the Jacobins started their dechristianisation campaign to set up the &quot;Cult of Reason&quot; of Hébert and Chaumette and later the &quot;Cult of the Supreme Being&quot; of the Committee of Public Safety, Marat was made a quasi-saint, and his bust often replaced crucifixes in the former churches of Paris.

After the Thermidorian Reaction, Marat&#x27;s reputation decreased. On 13 January 1795, Le Havre-Marat became simply Le Havre, the name it bears today. In February, his coffin was removed from the Panthéon and his busts and sculptures were destroyed. The 4 February 1795 (16 Pluviôse) issue of Le Moniteur Universel reported how, two days earlier, &quot;his busts had been knocked off their pedestals in several theatres and that some children had carried one of these busts about the streets, insulting it [before] dumping it in the rue Montmartre sewer to shouts of &#x27;Marat, voilà ton Panthéon !&#x27; [Marat, here is your Panthéon] His final resting place is the cemetery of the church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont.

A bronze sculpture of Marat was removed from Parc des Buttes Chaumont and was melted down during the Nazi occupation of Paris. Another was created in 2013 for the Musée de la Révolution française.

He continued to be held in high regard in the Soviet Union. Marat became a common name, and Marat Fjord in Severnaya Zemlya was named after him. Russian battleship &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; () was renamed &quot;Marat&quot; in 1921. A street in the centre of Sevastopol was named after Marat () on 3 January 1921, shortly after the Bolsheviks took over the city.

===Skin disease===
Described during his time as a man &quot;short in stature, deformed in person, and hideous in face,&quot; Marat has long been noted for physical irregularities. The nature of Marat&#x27;s debilitating skin disease, in particular, has been an object of ongoing medical interest. In the 19th century Thomas Carlyle alleged that the cause was syphilis, though this is very unlikely as syphilitic rashes are generally neither itchy nor as long-lasting as Marat&#x27;s skin condition was. Josef E. Jelinek noted that his skin disease was intensely itchy, blistering, began in the perianal region, and was associated with weight loss leading to emaciation. He was sick with it for the three years prior to his assassination, and spent most of this time in his bathtub. There were various minerals and medicines that were present in his bath while he soaked to help ease the pain caused by the disease. A bandana wrapped around his head was soaked in vinegar to reduce the severity of his discomfort. Jelinek&#x27;s diagnosis is dermatitis herpetiformis.

===Tub===
After his death, Marat&#x27;s wife may have sold his bathtub to her journalist neighbour, as it was included in an inventory of his possessions. The royalist de Saint-Hilaire bought the tub, taking it to Sarzeau, Morbihan in Brittany. His daughter, Capriole de Saint-Hilaire, inherited it when he died in 1805 and she passed it on to the Sarzeau curé when she died in 1862. A journalist for &quot;Le Figaro&quot; tracked down the tub in 1885. The curé then discovered that selling the tub could earn money for the parish, yet the Musée Carnavalet turned it down because of its lack of provenance as well as its high price. The curé approached Madame Tussaud&#x27;s waxworks, who agreed to purchase Marat&#x27;s bathtub for 100,000 francs, but the curé&#x27;s acceptance was lost in the mail. After rejecting other offers, including one from Phineas Barnum, the curé sold the tub for 5,000 francs to the Musée Grévin, where it remains today. The tub was in the shape of an old-fashioned high-buttoned shoe and had a copper lining.

<text>Bilateria () is a large clade of animals characterised by bilateral symmetry during embryonic development. This means their body plans are laid around a longitudinal axis with a front (or &quot;head&quot;) and a rear (or &quot;tail&quot;) end, as well as a left–right–symmetrical belly (ventral) and back (dorsal) surface. Nearly all bilaterians maintain a bilaterally symmetrical body as adults; the most notable exception is the echinoderms, which have pentaradial symmetry as adults, but bilateral symmetry as embryos. With few exceptions, bilaterian embryos are triploblastic, having three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm, and have complete digestive tracts with a separate mouth and anus. Some bilaterians lack body cavities, while others have a primary body cavity derived from the blastocoel, or a secondary cavity, the coelom. Cephalization is a characteristic feature among most bilaterians, where the sense organs and central nerve ganglia become concentrated at the front end of the animal.

Bilaterians constitute one of the five main lineages of animals, the other four being Porifera (sponges), Cnidaria (jellyfish, hydrozoans, sea anemones and corals), Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Placozoa. They rapidly diversified in the late Ediacaran and the Cambrian, and are now by far the most successful animal lineage, with over 98% of known animal species. Bilaterians are traditionally classified as either deuterostomes or protostomes, based on whether the blastopore becomes the anus or mouth. The recently erected phylum Xenacoelomorpha, once thought to be flatworms, has provided an extra challenge to bilaterian taxonomy, as they likely do not belong to either group.

== Body plan ==

Animals with a bilaterally symmetric body plan that mainly move in one direction have a head end (anterior) and a tail (posterior) end as well as a back (dorsal) and a belly (ventral); therefore they also have a left side and a right side. Having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. Most bilaterians (nephrozoans) have a gut that extends through the body from mouth to anus, and sometimes a wormlike body plan with a hydrostatic skeleton. Xenacoelomorphs, on the other hand, have a bag gut with one opening. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. 

== Evolution ==

=== Common ancestor ===

The hypothetical most recent common ancestor of all Bilateria is termed the &#x27;urbilaterian&#x27;. The nature of this first bilaterian is a matter of debate. One side suggests that acoelomates gave rise to the other groups (planuloid–aceloid hypothesis by Ludwig von Graff, Elie Metchnikoff, Libbie Hyman, or ). This means that the urbilaterian had a solid body, and all body cavities therefore secondarily arose later in different groups. The other side poses that the urbilaterian had a coelom, meaning that the main acoelomate phyla (flatworms and gastrotrichs) have secondarily lost their body cavities. 
This is the Archicoelomata hypothesis first proposed by A. T. Masterman in 1899. Variations of the Archicoelomata hypothesis are the Gastraea by Ernst Haeckel in 1872 or Adam Sedgwick, and more recently the Bilaterogastrea by , and the Trochaea by Claus Nielsen.

One proposal, by Johanna Taylor Cannon and colleagues, is that the original bilaterian was a bottom dwelling worm with a single body opening, similar to &quot;Xenoturbella&quot;. An alternative proposal, by Jaume Baguñà and colleagues, is that it may have resembled the planula larvae of some cnidarians, which unlike the radially-symmetric adults have some bilateral symmetry. However, Lewis I. Held presents evidence that it was segmented, as the mechanism for creating segments is shared between vertebrates (deuterostomes) and arthropods (protostomes).

Bilaterians, presumably including the urbilaterian, share many more Hox genes controlling the development of their more complex bodies, including of their heads, than do the Cnidaria and the Acoelomorpha.

=== Fossil record ===

The first evidence of Bilateria in the fossil record comes from trace fossils in Ediacaran sediments, and the first &quot;bona fide&quot; bilaterian fossil is &quot;Kimberella&quot;, dating to . Earlier fossils are controversial; the fossil &quot;Vernanimalcula&quot; may be the earliest known bilaterian, but may also represent an infilled bubble. Fossil embryos are known from around the time of &quot;Vernanimalcula&quot; (), but none of these have bilaterian affinities. Burrows believed to have been created by bilaterian life forms have been found in the Tacuarí Formation of Uruguay, and were believed to be at least 585 million years old. However, more recent evidence shows these fossils are actually late Paleozoic, not Ediacaran.

=== Phylogeny ===


The Bilateria are now by far the most successful animal lineage, with over 98% of known animal species. The group has traditionally been divided into two main lineages or superphyla. The deuterostomes traditionally include the echinoderms, hemichordates, chordates, and the extinct Vetulicolia. The protostomes include most of the rest, such as arthropods, annelids, molluscs, and flatworms. There are several differences, most notably in how the embryo develops. In particular, the first opening of the embryo becomes the mouth in protostomes, and the anus in deuterostomes. Many taxonomists now recognise at least two more superphyla among the protostomes, Ecdysozoa and Spiralia. The arrow worms (Chaetognatha) have proven difficult to classify; recent studies place them in the Gnathifera.

The traditional division of Bilateria into Deuterostomia and Protostomia was challenged when new morphological and molecular evidence supported a sister relationship between the acoelomate taxa, Acoela and Nemertodermatida (together called Acoelomorpha), and the remaining bilaterians. The latter clade was called Nephrozoa by Jondelius et al. (2002) and Eubilateria by Baguña and Riutort (2004). The acoelomorph taxa had previously been considered flatworms with secondarily lost characteristics, but the new relationship suggested that the simple acoelomate worm form was the original bilaterian body plan and that the coelom, the digestive tract, excretory organs, and nerve cords developed in the Nephrozoa. Subsequently, the acoelomorphs were placed in phylum Xenacoelomorpha, together with the xenoturbellids, and the sister relationship between Xenacoelomorpha and Nephrozoa confirmed in phylogenomic analyses.

A modern consensus phylogenetic tree for Bilateria, from a 2014 review by Casey Dunn and colleagues, is shown below.

A different hypothesis is that Ambulacraria are sister to Xenacoelomorpha together forming Xenambulacraria. Xenambulacraria may be sister to Chordata or to Centroneuralia (corresponding to Nephrozoa without Ambulacraria, or, as shown here, to Chordata + Protostomia). The cladogram indicates approximately when some clades radiated into newer clades, in millions of years ago (Mya). A 2019 study by Hervé Philippe and colleagues presents the tree, cautioning that &quot;the support values are very low, meaning there is no solid evidence to refute the traditional protostome and deuterostome dichotomy&quot;.

By 2024, the deuterostomes, the group in which the anus forms before the mouth in the early embryo, have been stated to be definitely a clade, fitting in with the Nephrozoa hypothesis (with Nephrozoa separate from Xenacoelomorpha).

== Taxonomic history ==

The Bilateria were named by the Austrian embryologist Berthold Hatschek in 1888. In his classification, the group included the Zygoneura, Ambulacraria, and Chordonii (the Chordata). In 1910, the Austrian zoologist Karl Grobben renamed the Zygoneura to Protostomia, and created the Deuterostomia to encompass the Ambulacraria and Chordonii.

<text>The Organisation armée secrète (OAS, &quot;Secret Army Organisation&quot;) was a far-right dissident French paramilitary and terrorist organisation during the Algerian War, founded in 1961 by Raoul Salan, Pierre Lagaillarde and Jean-Jacques Susini. The OAS carried out several terrorist attacks, including tortures, bombings and assassinations, all resulting in over 2,000 deaths in an attempt to prevent Algeria&#x27;s independence from French colonial rule. Its motto was &quot;&quot; (&quot;Algeria is French and so will remain&quot;).

The OAS was formed from existing networks, calling themselves &quot;counter-terrorists&quot;, &quot;self-defence groups&quot;, or &quot;resistance&quot;, which had carried out attacks on the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) and their perceived supporters since early in the war. It was officially formed in Francoist Spain, in Madrid in January 1961, as a response by some French politicians and French military officers to the 8 January 1961 referendum on self-determination concerning Algeria, which had been organised by President de Gaulle.

By acts of bombings and targeted assassinations in both metropolitan France and French Algerian territories, which are estimated to have resulted in 2,000 deaths between April 1961 and April 1962, the OAS attempted to prevent Algerian independence. This campaign culminated in a wave of attacks that followed the March 1962 Évian Accords, which granted independence to Algeria and marked the beginning of the exodus of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; (ethnic Europeans born in Algeria), and in Jean Bastien-Thiry&#x27;s 1962 assassination attempt against president de Gaulle in the Paris suburb of Le Petit-Clamart. The existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, who supported the FLN was a notable target of their actions.

The OAS still has admirers in French nationalist movements. In July 2006, some OAS sympathisers attempted to relight the flame of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to commemorate the Oran massacre on 5 July 1962.

== History ==
The OAS was created in response to the January 1961 referendum on self-determination for Algeria. It was founded in Spain, in January 1961, by former officers, Pierre Lagaillarde (who led the 1960 Siege of Algiers), General Raoul Salan (who took part in the 1961 Algiers putsch or &quot;Generals&#x27; Uprising&quot;) and Jean-Jacques Susini, along with other members of the French Army, including Yves Guérin-Sérac, and former members of the French Foreign Legion from the First Indochina War (1946–1954). &quot;OAS-Métro&quot;, the branch in metropolitan France, was led by captain Pierre Sergent. These officers united earlier anti-FLN networks such as the &quot;Organisation de Résistance de L&#x27;Algérie Française&quot;. While the movement had a broadly anticommunist and authoritarian base, in common with the political outlook of many colonists, it also included many ex-communists and a number of members who saw its struggle in terms of defending fraternal bonds between Algerians and the colonists against the FLN. In France the OAS mainly recruited amongst overtly fascist political groups. In Algeria its makeup was more politically diverse, and included a group of Algerian Jews, led by Jean Guenassia, who began armed resistance after a series of FLN attacks on the Jewish quarter in Oran. Some Algerian OAS members conceived of the conflict in terms of the French Resistance, and in contrast to later Gaullist depictions of the movement, it included a number of former Resistance members in addition to Vichy collaborators.

Resistance against Algerian independence commenced in January 1960, with further violence breaking out in 1961 during the General&#x27;s Uprising. Daniele Ganser of the ETH Parallel History Project claims that Gladio stay-behind networks, directed by NATO, were involved, but no definitive proof has been found. Both of these insurrections were swiftly suppressed and many of the leaders who had created the OAS were imprisoned.

By acts of sabotage and assassination in both metropolitan France and French Algerian territories, the OAS attempted to prevent Algerian independence. The first victim was Pierre Popie, attorney and president of the People&#x27;s Republican Movement (&quot;Mouvement Républicain Populaire&quot;, MRP), who stated on TV, &quot;French Algeria is dead&quot; (&quot;L’Algérie française est morte&quot;). Roger Gavoury, head of the French police in Algiers, was assassinated at the direction of Roger Degueldre, leader of the OAS Commando Delta, with the actual killing done by Claude Piegts and Albert Dovecar on 31 May 1961 (Piegts and Dovecar were executed by a firing-squad on 7 June 1962; Degueldre on 6 July). The OAS became notorious for &quot;stroungas&quot;, attacks using plastic explosives.

In October 1961 Pierre Lagaillarde, who had escaped to Francoist Spain following the 1960 barricades week, was arrested in Madrid, along with the Italian activist Guido Giannettini. Franco then exiled him to the Canary Islands.

The Delta commandos engaged in indiscriminate killing sprees, on 17 March 1962; against cleaning-ladies on 5 May; on 15 March 1962 against six inspectors of the National Education Ministry, who directed the &quot;Educative Social Centres&quot; (&quot;Centres sociaux éducatifs&quot;), including Mouloud Feraoun, an Algerian writer, etc. It is estimated that the assassinations carried out by the OAS between April 1961 and April 1962 left 2,000 people dead and twice as many wounded.

The OAS attempted several times to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle. The most prominent attempt was a 22 August 1962 ambush at Petit-Clamart, a Paris suburb, planned by a military engineer who was not an OAS member, Jean Bastien-Thiry. Bastien-Thiry was executed in March 1963 after de Gaulle refused to grant him amnesty. A fictionalised version of this attack was recreated in the 1971 book by Frederick Forsyth, &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, and in the 1973 film of the same name.

The OAS use of extreme violence created strong opposition from some &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; and in mainland France. As a result, the OAS eventually found itself in violent clandestine conflict with not only the FLN but also French secret services and with a Gaullist paramilitary, the &quot;Mouvement pour la Communauté&quot; (the MPC). Originally a political movement in Algiers, the MPC eventually became a paramilitary force in response to OAS violence. The group obtained valuable information which was routinely passed on to the French secret services, but was eventually destroyed by OAS assassinations.

== March 1962 Evian agreements and the struggle of the OAS ==

The main hope of the OAS was to prove that the FLN was secretly restarting military action after a ceasefire was agreed in the Evian agreements of 19 March 1962 and the referendum of June 1962, so during these three months, the OAS unleashed a new terrorist campaign to force the FLN to abandon the ceasefire. Over 100 bombs a day were detonated by the OAS in March in pursuit of this goal. OAS operatives set off an average of 120 bombs per day in March, with targets including hospitals and schools. Dozens of Arab residents were killed at Place du Gouvernement when 24 mortar rounds were fired from the European stronghold of Bab el-Oued. On 21 March, the OAS issued a flyer where they proclaimed that the French military had become an &quot;occupation force.&quot; It organized car bombings: 25 killed in Oran on 28 February 1962 and 62 killed in Algiers on 2 May, among others. On 22 March, they took control of Bab el-Oued and attacked French soldiers, killing six of them. The French military then surrounded them and stormed the neighbourhood. The battle killed 15 French soldiers and 20 OAS members, and injured 150 more. On 26 March, the leaders of the OAS proclaimed a general strike in Algiers and called for the European settlers to come to Bab el-Oued in order to break the blockade by military forces loyal to de Gaulle and the Republic. A detachment of &quot;tirailleurs&quot; (Muslim troops in the French Army) fired on the demonstrators, killing 54, injuring 140, and traumatising the settlers&#x27; population in what is known as the &quot;gunfight of the Rue d&#x27;Isly&quot;. In coincidence with the uprising of Bab-el Oued, 200 OAS &quot;maquis&quot; marched from Algiers to Ouarsenis, a mountainous region between Oran and Algiers. They tried to overrun two French military outposts and gain support for local Muslim tribes loyal to France, but instead they were harassed and eventually defeated by Legion units led by Colonel Albert Brothier after several days of fighting. Some clashes between the French army and the OAS involving grenades and mortar fire took place at Oran as late as 10 April. At least one Lieutenant and one Second-Lieutenant were killed by the OAS during the fighting.

In April 1962, the OAS leader, Raoul Salan was captured. Despite the OAS bombing campaign, the FLN remained resolute in its agreement to the ceasefire; further, on 17 June 1962, the OAS also began a ceasefire. The Algerian authority officially guaranteed the security of the remaining Europeans, but in early July 1962 the Oran Massacre occurred; hundreds of armed people came down to European areas of the city, attacking European civilians. The violence lasted several hours, including lynching and acts of torture in public places in all areas of Oran by civilians supported by the ALN—the armed wing of the FLN, at the time evolving into the Algerian Army—resulting in 3,000 missing people:

By 1963, the main OAS operatives were either dead, in exile, or in prison. Claude Piegts and Albert Dovecar were executed by firing squad on 7 June 1962, and Roger Degueldre on 6 July 1962. Jean Bastien-Thiry, who had attempted the Petit-Clamart assassination on de Gaulle, but was not formally a member of the OAS, was also executed, on 11 March 1963. With the arrest of Gilles Buscia in 1965, the organisation effectively ceased to exist. The jailed OAS members were amnestied by De Gaulle under a July 1968 act. Putschist generals still alive in November 1982 were reintegrated into the Army by another amnesty law: Raoul Salan, Edmond Jouhaud, and six other generals benefited from this law.

== Legacy ==
Many OAS members later took part in various anti-communist struggles around the world. Following the disbandment of the organisation, and the execution of several of its members, the OAS chaplain, Georges Grasset, organised the flight of OAS members, from a route going from Paris to Francoist Spain and finally to Argentina. Grasset arrived in 1962 in Buenos Aires to take charge of the Argentine branch of the Cité Catholique, an integral Catholic group formed by Jean Ousset, the personal secretary of Charles Maurras, as an offshoot of the monarchist &quot;Action Française&quot;. This anti-communist religious organisation was formed of many Algerian war veterans and close to the OAS. Charles Lacheroy and Colonel Trinquier, who theorised the systemic use of torture in counter-insurgency doctrine in &quot;Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency&quot; (1961), were members, along with Colonel Jean Gardes, who had first theorised counter-insurgency tactics during the Indochina War (1947–1954), Jean Ousset developed the concept of &quot;subversion&quot; referring to an essential enemy threatening the existence of Occident itself. Gardes arrived in Argentina in 1963, a year after the end of the Algerian War. There, he delivered counter-insurgency courses at the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy (ESMA), which became infamous during the &quot;Dirty War&quot; in the 1970s for being used as an internment and torture center. Soon after Gardes met Federico Lucas Roussillon, an Argentine naval lieutenant commander, the cadets at the ESMA were shown the film &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; (1966) by Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, during which the fictional Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu and his paratroops make systematic use of torture, block warden system, and death flights.

The Argentine admiral Luis María Mendía testified in January 2007 that a French intelligence agent, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the &quot;disappearance&quot; of the two French nuns, Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction, but did admit being a former OAS member who escaped to Argentina after the Evian agreements.

The financial crime expert Veit Buetterlin named the OAS as an example of a terror group which committed bank robberies to finance its operations. In a CNN interview, Buetterlin mentioned the attempted assassination of Charles de Gaulle as a historic example and related it to cases of the recent past where sanctioned parties are conducting cyber attacks on banks to acquire funds illegally.

== In popular culture ==

The OAS is referenced in Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. James Bond&#x27;s future father-in-law Marc-Ange, the head of a Corsican crime faction known as Union Corse, refers to the OAS in chapter 24, due to the OAS having a French military helicopter in their possession. Because of the OAS indebtedness to Marc-Ange and the Union Corse, the helicopter is loaned to the MI-6 – Marc-Ange/Union Corse coalition endeavoring to thwart Ernst Stavro Blofeld&#x27;s plot to unleash biological warfare in the UK&#x27;s agricultural industry.

OAS graffiti appears outside a bakery approximately eight minutes into the 1963 film &quot;The Bakery Girl of Monceau&quot;. Two minutes later, following the second appearance of the exterior, similar graffiti appears to have been removed from the facade of the bakery.

The OAS featured prominently in Jack Higgins&#x27; 1964 novel &quot;Wrath of the Lion&quot;, in which the organization fictionally manages to suborn the crew of a French Navy submarine and use it for missions of revenge.

Alain Cavalier&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;L&#x27;Insoumis&quot; stars Alain Delon as a deserter from the French Foreign Legion who joins the OAS on a kidnapping mission. Cavalier had already addressed the issue in the 1962 film &quot;Le Combat dans l&#x27;île&quot;, starring Romy Schneider and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Despite not being named its acronym, the movie is set in the context of the campaign of bombings and assassinations by the OAS.

The OAS features prominently in the 1971 novel &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; by Frederick Forsyth, and its film adaptation. The story deals primarily with a fictional assassination plot against Charles de Gaulle, where the organisation hires a British contract killer (the Jackal) to kill de Gaulle. Bastien-Thiry and the Petit-Clamart plot figure prominently in the early sections of the story. Forsyth also mentions the OAS in his 1974 novel &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, with several of its protagonists having joined the movement. The fictional Colonel Rodin from &quot;Jackal&quot; is also alluded to.

The OAS is referenced in the Oliver Stone film &quot;JFK&quot;, as suspected conspirator Clay Shaw (played by Tommy Lee Jones) is alleged to have business connections with them. The plot to assassinate De Gaulle at the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart is also mentioned several times in the film.

The 2002 movie &quot;Legion of Honor&quot; is about an Englishman who joins the Foreign Legion and is set in Algeria shortly before their independence. &quot;OAS&quot; is mentioned numerous times as well as shown in graffiti outside a number of structures.

The OAS is referred to in the 2008 film &quot;Mesrine: Public Enemy No.1&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Instinc de Mort)&quot;, describing the life of French criminal Jacques Mesrine. The character of Guido (played by Gérard Depardieu) is a member of OAS. Guido mentions OAS multiple times and together with Mesrine he assassinates another OAS member, who in his last moments declares: &quot;De Gaulle killed us&quot;.

== Subsequent groups with ties to OAS ==

In November 2016, an extreme right-wing terrorist cell calling itself the &quot;Organisation d’armées sociales&quot; (OAS) emerged in France. The acronym was a nod to the original Organisation Armée Secrète. It was inspired by Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik and consisted of 9 people led by former Action Française activist Logan Nisin. The cell had planned attacks against kebab shops, places of worship (especially mosques), drug dealers and politicians: Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Christophe Castaner were specific targets. The group was taken down by French authorities in November 2017 before it was able to accomplish any attacks.
