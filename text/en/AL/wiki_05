<text>[[Babylonia]]n law is a subset of cuneiform law that has received particular study due to the large amount of archaeological material that has been found for it. So-called &quot;contracts&quot; exist in the thousands, including a great variety of deeds, conveyances, bonds, receipts, accounts, and most important of all, actual legal decisions given by the judges in the law courts. Historical inscriptions, royal charters and rescripts, dispatches, private letters and the general literature afford welcome supplementary information. Even grammatical and lexicographical texts contain many extracts or short sentences bearing on law and custom. The so-called &quot;Sumerian Family Laws&quot; are preserved in this way.

Other cultures involved with ancient Mesopotamia shared the same common laws and precedents extending to the form of contacts that Kenneth Kitchen has studied and compared to the form of contracts in the Bible with particular note to the sequence of blessings and curses that bind the deal. The Maxims of Ptahhotep and Sharia Law, also include certifications for professionals like doctors, lawyers and skilled craftsmen which prescribe penalties for malpractice very similar to the code of Hammurabi.

The discovery of the now-celebrated Code of Hammurabi (hereinafter simply termed &quot;the Code&quot;) has made possible a more systematic study than could have resulted from just the classification and interpretation of other material. Fragments of other Ancient codes exist and have been published, but there still remain many points whereof evidence is still lacking. There survive legal texts from the earliest writings through the Hellenistic period, but evidence on a particular point may be very full for one period and almost entirely lacking for another. The Code forms the backbone of most reconstructions. Fragments of it recovered from Assur-bani-pal&#x27;s library at Nineveh and later Babylonian copies show that it was studied, divided into chapters, entitled &quot;Ninu ilu sirum&quot; from its incipit (opening words), and recopied for fifteen hundred years or more.

Much Babylonian legal precedent remained in force, even through the Persian, Greek and Parthian conquests, which had little effect on private life in Babylonia; and it survived to influence Romans. The laws and customs that preceded the Code may be called &quot;early&quot;; that of the Neo-Babylonian empire (as well as the Persian, Greek, etc.), &quot;late&quot;. The law of Assyria was derived from the Babylonian, but it conserved early features long after they had disappeared elsewhere.

==History==

===Tribal influence===
The early history of Mesopotamia is the story of a struggle for supremacy between the cities. A metropolis demanded tribute and military support from its subject cities but left their local cults and customs unaffected. City rights and usages were respected by kings and conquerors alike. When the ancient Semitic-speaking peoples settled in the cities of Mesopotamia, their tribal customs passed over into city law.

As late as the accession of Assur-bani-pal and Shamash-shum-ukin, we find the Babylonians appending to their city laws that groups of aliens to the number of twenty at a time were free to enter the city; that foreign women, once married to Babylonian husbands, could not be enslaved; and that not even a dog that entered the city could be put to death untried.

The population of Babylonia was multi-ethnic from early times, and intercommunication between the cities was incessant. Every city had a large number of resident aliens. This freedom of intercourse must have tended to assimilate custom. It was, however, reserved for the genius of Hammurabi to make Babylon his metropolis and weld together his vast empire by a uniform system of law.

===Hammurabi&#x27;s Code===

By Hammurabi&#x27;s time, almost all trace of tribal custom had already disappeared from the law of the Code. It is state law—self-help, blood-feud, and marriage by capture, are all absent; though code of family solidarity, district responsibility, ordeal, and the &quot;lex talionis&quot; (an eye for an eye), are primitive features that remain. The king is a benevolent autocrat, easily accessible to all his subjects, both able and willing to protect the weak against the highest-placed oppressor. The royal power, however, can only pardon when private resentment is appeased. Judges are strictly supervised, and appeal is allowed. The whole land is covered with feudal holdings, masters of the levy, police, etc. There is a regular postal system. The &quot;pax Babylonica&quot; is so assured that private individuals do not hesitate to ride in their carriage from Babylon to the coast of the Mediterranean. The position of women is free and dignified.

The Code did not merely embody contemporary custom or conserve ancient law. It is true that centuries of law-abiding and litigious habitude had accumulated, in the temple archives of each city, vast stores of precedent in ancient deeds and records of judicial decisions and that intercourse had assimilated city custom. The universal habit of writing, and perpetual recourse to written contract, further modified primitive custom and ancient precedent.

If the parties themselves could agree to the terms, the Code as a rule left them free to make contracts. Their deed of agreement was drawn up in the temple by a notary public and confirmed with an oath &quot;by god and the king.&quot; It was publicly sealed and witnessed by professional witnesses, as well as by collaterally interested parties. The manner in which it was executed may have been sufficient guarantee that its stipulations were not impious or illegal. Custom or public opinion doubtlessly ensured that the parties would not agree to &quot;wrong&quot;. If a dispute arose, the judges dealt first with the contract. They might not sustain it, but if the parties did not dispute it, they were free to observe it. The judges&#x27; decision might, however, be appealed. Many contracts contain the proviso that in case of future dispute, the parties would abide by &quot;the decision of the king.&quot; The Code made known, in a vast number of cases, what that decision would be, and many cases of appeal to the king were returned to the judges with orders to decide in accordance with it. The Code itself was carefully and logically arranged, its sections arranged by subject matter. Nevertheless, the order is not that of modern scientific treatises, so a somewhat different order than either is most convenient for our purpose.

==Three classes==

The Code contemplates the whole population as falling into three classes: the &quot;avilum&quot;, the &quot;mushkenu&quot; and the &quot;ardu&quot;.

The &quot;avilum&quot; was originally a patrician, a man from an elite family, possessed of full civil rights, whose birth, marriage and death were registered. He had aristocratic privileges and responsibilities, and the right to exact retaliation for corporal injuries, but was liable to a heavier punishment for crimes and misdemeanours, higher fees and fines. To this class belonged the king and court, the higher officials, the professions and craftsmen. Over time, the term became a mere courtesy title—already in the Code, when status is not concerned, it is used to denote anyone. There was no property qualification, nor does the term appear to be racial.

It is most difficult to characterize the &quot;mushkenu&quot; exactly. The term in time came to mean &quot;a beggar&quot;, and that meaning has passed through Aramaic and Hebrew into many modern languages; but though the Code does not regard him as necessarily poor, he may have been landless. He was free but had to accept monetary compensation for corporal injuries, paid smaller fees and fines, and even paid less offerings to the gods. He inhabited a separate quarter of the city. There is no reason to regard him as specially connected with the court, as a royal pensioner, nor as forming the bulk of the population. The rarity of any references to him in contemporary documents makes further specification conjectural.

The &quot;ardu&quot; was a slave, his master&#x27;s chattel, and formed a very numerous class. He could acquire property and even own other slaves. His master clothed and fed him and paid his doctor&#x27;s fees, but took all compensation paid for injury done to him. His master usually found him a slave girl for a wife (the children were then born slaves), often set him up in a house (with farm or business) and simply took an annual rent of him. Otherwise, he might marry a free woman (the children were then free), who might bring him a dower that his master could not touch, and at his death, one-half of his property passed to his master as his heir. He could acquire his freedom by purchase from his master, or might be freed and dedicated to a temple, or even adopted, when he became an &quot;amelu&quot; and not a &quot;mushkenu&quot;. Slaves were recruited by purchase abroad, from captives taken in war, or by freemen degraded for debt or crime. A slave often ran away; if caught, the captor was bound to restore him to his master, and the Code fixes a reward of two shekels that the owner must pay the captor. It was about one-tenth of the average value of a slave. To detain or harbour a slave was punishable by death. So was aiding him to escape the city gates. A slave bore an identification mark, removable only by a surgical operation, that later consisted of his owner&#x27;s name tattooed or branded on the arm. On the other hand, on the great estates in Assyria and its subject provinces there were many serfs, mostly of subject race, settled captives, or quondam slaves; tied to the soil they cultivated and sold with the estate, yet capable of possessing land and property of their own. There is little trace of serfs in Babylonia, unless the &quot;mushkenu&quot; is really a serf.

==Citizens tenants of gods==
The god of a city was originally considered the owner of its land, which encircled it with an inner ring of irrigable arable land and an outer fringe of pasture; the citizens were his tenants. The god and his vice regent, the king, had long ceased to disturb tenancy and were content with fixed dues &quot;in naturalia&quot;, stock, money or service.

One of the earliest monuments records the purchase by a king of a large estate for his son, paying a fair market price and adding a handsome honorarium to the many owners, in costly garments, plate, and precious articles of furniture. The Code recognizes complete private ownership of land but apparently extends the right to hold land to votaries and merchants; but all land sold was subject to its fixed charges. The king, however, could free land from these charges by charter, which was a frequent way of rewarding those who deserved well of the state.

It is from these charters that we learn of the obligations lying upon land. The state demanded men for the army and the &quot;corvée&quot;, as well as dues in kind. A certain area was bound to provide a bowman, together with his linked pikeman (who bore the shield for both), and to furnish them with supplies for the campaign. This area was termed a &quot;bow&quot; as early as the 8th century BC, but the practice goes back much earlier. Later, a horseman was also due from certain areas. A man was only bound to serve a certain number of times, but the land still had to find a man annually. This service was usually discharged by slaves and serfs, but the &quot;amelu&quot; (and perhaps the &quot;mushkenu&quot;) also went to war. The bows were grouped together in tens and hundreds. The &quot;corvée&quot; was less regular. Special liabilities also lay upon riparian owners to repair canals, bridges, quays, etc. The letters of Hammurabi often deal with claims to exemption. Religious officials and shepherds in charge of flocks were exempt from military duty.

The state claimed certain proportions of all crops, stock, etc. The king&#x27;s messengers could commandeer any subject&#x27;s property, giving a receipt. Further, every city had its own octroi duties, customs, ferry dues, highway and water rates. The king had long ceased to be owner of the land, if he ever was. He had his own royal estates, his private property, and dues from all his subjects. The higher officials had endowments and official residences.

The Code regulates the feudal position of certain classes. They held an estate from the king, consisting of a house, a garden, a field, stock, and a salary, on condition of personal service on the king&#x27;s errand. They could not delegate the service, on penalty of death. When ordered abroad, they could nominate a capable son to hold the benefice and carry on the duty. If there was no capable son, the state put in a &quot;locum tenens&quot; but granted one-third to the wife to maintain herself and her children. The fief was otherwise inalienable; it could not be sold, pledged, exchanged, sublet, devised or diminished. Other land was leased from the state. Ancestral estate was strictly tied to the family. If a holder would sell, the family kept the right of redemption, and there seems to have been no time limit to its exercise.

==Temple==
The temple occupied a most important position. It received income from its estates, from tithes and other fixed dues, as well as from the sacrifices (a customary share) and other offerings of the faithful—vast amounts of all sorts of naturalia, besides money and permanent gifts. The larger temples had many officials and servants.

Originally, perhaps, each town clustered round one temple, and each head of family had a right to minister there and share its receipts. As the city grew, the right to so many days a year at one shrine (or its gate) descended within certain families and became a kind of property that could be pledged, rented or shared within the family, but not alienated. Despite all these demands, the temples became great granaries and storehouses and were also the city archives. The temple had its responsibilities. If a citizen was captured by the enemy and could not ransom himself, the temple of his city must do so. To the temple came the poor farmer to borrow seed, grain, or supplies for harvesters, etc.—advances that he repaid without interest.

The king&#x27;s power over the temple was not proprietary, but administrative. He might borrow from it, but repaid like other borrowers. The tithe seems to have been considered the rent due to the god for his land. It is not clear that all lands paid tithe; perhaps only such as once had a special connection with the temple.

The Code deals with a class of persons devoted to the service of a god, as vestals or hierodules. The vestals were vowed to chastity, lived together in a great nunnery, were forbidden to enter a tavern, and, together with other votaries, had many privileges.

==Property law==
The Code recognizes many ways of disposing of property: sale, lease, barter, gift, dedication, deposit, loan, or pledge, all of which were matters of contract. Sale was the delivery of a purchase (in the case of real estate, symbolized by a staff, a key, or deed of conveyance) in return for purchase money, receipts being given for both. Credit, if given, was treated as a debt, and secured as a loan by the seller to be repaid by the buyer, for which he gave a bond.

The Code only allows claims substantiated by documents, or in some cases the oath of witnesses. Saving contracts and receipts thus assumed a vital importance in Babylon - in fact it could literally be a matter of life or death. A buyer had to be sure of the seller&#x27;s title. If he bought (or received on deposit) property from even a minor or a slave without witnessing contracts, he would be executed as a thief (§7). If purchased goods were stolen and the rightful owner reclaimed them, he had to prove his purchase by producing the seller and the deed of sale, or witnesses to it; otherwise, he would be adjudged a thief and die. If he proved his purchase, he had to give up the property but could pursue a remedy against the seller or, if the seller had died, could reclaim fivefold from his estate.

A man who bought a slave abroad might find that he had previously been stolen or captured from Babylonia; he would then have to restore him to his former owner without recompense. If he bought property belonging to a feudal holding, or to a ward in Chancery, he had to return it as well as forfeit what he paid for it. He could repudiate the purchase of a slave attacked by the &quot;bennu&quot; sickness within a month (later, a hundred days) and could hold a newly purchased female slave for three days &quot;on approval&quot;. A defect of title, or an undisclosed liability, would invalidate a sale at any time.

==Leasing==
Landowners frequently cultivated their land themselves, but could also employ a husbandman, or rent it. The husbandman was bound to carry out proper cultivation, raise an average crop, and leave the field in good tilth. In case the crop failed, the Code fixed a statutory return. Land might be leased at a fixed rent, where the Code stipulates that accidental loss fell on the tenant. If leased on profit-sharing terms, the landlord and tenant shared the loss proportionally to their stipulated share of profit. If the tenant paid his rent and kept the land in good tilth, the landlord could not interfere nor forbid subletting.

Wasteland could be leased for reclamation, the tenant being rent-free for three years and paying a stipulated rent in the fourth year. If the tenant neglected to reclaim the land, the Code stipulated that he must hand it over in good tilth and set a statutory rent. Gardens or plantations were leased in the same ways and under the same conditions; but for date groves, four years&#x27; free tenure was allowed.

The metayer system was common, especially on temple lands. The landlord found land, labour, oxen for ploughing and working the watering machines, carting, threshing or other implements, grain seed, rations for the workmen and fodder for the cattle. The tenant, or steward, usually had other land of his own. If he stole the seed, rations or fodder, the Code stipulated that his fingers be cut off. If he appropriated or sold the implements, or impoverished or sublet the cattle, he was heavily fined and in default of payment, might be condemned to be torn to pieces by the cattle on the field. Rent was determined by contract.

Irrigation was essential for farming in this region. If the irrigator neglected to repair his dike or left his runnel open and caused a flood, he had to make good the damage done to his neighbours&#x27; crops or be sold with his family to pay the cost. The theft of a watering machine, water-bucket or other agricultural implement was heavily fined.

Houses were usually leased for the year, but also for longer terms, rent being paid in advance, half-yearly. The contract generally specified that the house be in good repair, and the tenant was bound to keep it so. The woodwork, including doors and door frames, was removable, and the tenant might bring and take away his own. The Code stipulated that if the landlord re-entered before the term was up, he must remit a fair proportion of the rent. Land could be leased for the purpose of building houses or other buildings on it, the tenant being rent-free for eight or ten years; after which the building came into the landlord&#x27;s possession.

==Hired labour==
Despite the multitude of slaves, hired labour was often needed, especially at harvest. This was a matter of contract, and the employer, who usually paid in advance, might demand a collateral against fulfillment of the work. Cattle were hired for ploughing, working the watering machines, carting, threshing, etc. The Code fixed a statutory wage for sowers, ox-drivers, field-labourers, and hire for oxen, asses, etc.

There were many herds and flocks. The flocks were committed to a shepherd, who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The Code fixed his wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for ox, sheep for sheep and must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of the flock had to be repaid tenfold, but loss due to disease or wild beasts fell upon the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his own neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of crops, he had to pay damages fourfold; if he turned them into standing crops when they ought to have been folded, he paid twelvefold.

==Debt==
In commerce, payment in kind was still common, though contracts usually stipulated cash, naming the currency expected—that of Babylon, Larsa, Assyria, Carchemish, etc. The Code stipulated, however, that a debtor must be allowed to pay in produce according to a statutory scale. If a debtor had neither money nor crops, the creditor must not refuse goods.

Debt was secured on the debtor&#x27;s own person. Distraint on a debtor&#x27;s grain was forbidden by the Code; not only must the creditor return it, but his illegal action forfeited his claim altogether. An unwarranted seizure for debt was fined, as was the distraint of a working ox.

If a debtor were seized for debt, he could nominate as &quot;mancipium&quot;, or hostage to work off the debt, his wife, child, or slave. The creditor could only hold a wife or child three years as &quot;mancipium&quot;. If the &quot;mancipium&quot; died a natural death while in the creditor&#x27;s possession, no claim could lie against the latter; but if he was the cause of death by cruelty, he had to give son for son, or pay for a slave. He could sell a slave-hostage, but not a slave-girl who had borne her master children; she had to be redeemed by her owner.

The debtor could also pledge his property and in contracts, often pledged a field, house or crop. The Code stipulated, however, that the debtor must take the crop himself and pay the creditor from its yield. If the crop failed, payment was deferred, and no interest could be charged for that year. If the debtor did not cultivate the field himself, he had to pay for its cultivation, but if the field was already cultivated, he must harvest it himself and pay his debt from the crop. If the cultivator did not get a crop, this would not cancel his contract.

Pledges were often made where the intrinsic value of the article was equivalent to the amount of the debt; but antichretic pledge was more common, where the profit of the pledge was a set-off against the interest of the debt. The whole property of a debtor might be pledged as collateral for payment of a debt, without any of it passing through the hands of the creditor. Personal guarantees were often given in Babylon that the debtor would repay, or the guarantor become liable himself.

==Trade==
Trade was very extensive. A common procedure was for a merchant to entrust his goods or money to a traveling agent, who sought a market for his goods. The caravans travelled far beyond the limits of the empire.

The Code insisted that the agent should inventory and give a receipt for all that he received. No claim could be made for anything not so entered. Even if the agent made no profit, he was bound to return double what he had received; if he made poor profit, he had to make up the deficiency; but he was not responsible for loss by robbery or extortion on his travels. On his return, the lending merchant must give him a receipt for what was handed over to him. Any false entry or claim on the agent&#x27;s part was penalised threefold; on the lending merchant&#x27;s part, sixfold. In normal cases, profits were divided according to contract, usually equally.

A considerable amount of forwarding (advancing wares to the agent up front) was done by the caravans. The carrier gave a receipt for the consignment, took all responsibility, and exacted a receipt upon delivery. If he defaulted, he paid fivefold. He was usually paid in advance. Deposit, especially warehousing of grain, was charged for at one-sixtieth. The warehouse man took all risks and paid double for all shortage, but no claim could be made unless he had given a properly witnessed receipt.

Water traffic on the Euphrates and canal system was early on, quite considerable. Ships, whose tonnage was estimated by the amount of grain they could carry, were continually hired for the transport of all kinds of goods. The Code fixes the price for shipbuilding and insists on the builder&#x27;s giving a year&#x27;s guarantee of seaworthiness. It also fixes the rate of hire for ship and crew. The captain was responsible for the freight and the ship; he had to replace all loss. Even if he refloated the ship, he had to pay a fine of half its value for sinking it. In the case of collision, the boat under way was responsible for damages to the boat at anchor.

The Code also regulated the liquor traffic—fixing a fair price for beer and forbidding the connivance of the tavern keeper (a female) at disorderly conduct or treasonable assembly, under pain of death. She was required to take the offenders to the palace—implying an efficient and accessible police system.

Payment through a banker or by written draft against deposit was frequent. Bonds to pay were treated as negotiable. Interest was rarely charged on advances by the temple or wealthy landowners for pressing needs, but this may have been part of the metayer system. The borrowers may have been tenants. Interest was charged at very high rates for overdue loans of this kind. Merchants (and even temples in some cases) made ordinary business loans, charging from 20% to 30%.

==Family law==

===Marriage===
Marriage retained the form of purchase, but was essentially a contract to be husband and wife together. The marriage of young people was usually arranged between their relatives—the groom&#x27;s father
the bride-price, which, with other gifts, the suitor ceremonially presented to the bride&#x27;s father. This bride-price was usually then handed over by her father to the bride upon her marriage, and so returned into the bridegroom&#x27;s possession, along with her dowry, which was her portion of the family&#x27;s inheritance as a daughter.

The bride-price varied greatly, according to the status of the parties, but surpassed the price of a slave. The Code stipulated that if the father did not give the suitor his daughter after accepting the suitor&#x27;s gifts, he must return the gifts. The bride-price had to be returned even if the father reneged on the marriage contract because of slander of the suitor on the part of the suitor&#x27;s friend, and the Code stipulated that the slanderer should not marry the girl (and thus would not profit from his slander). Conversely, if a suitor changed his mind, he forfeited the presents.

The dowry might include real estate, but generally consisted of personal effects and household furniture. It remained the wife&#x27;s for life, descending to her children, if any; otherwise returning to her family, when the husband could deduct the bride-price if it had not been given to her, or return it if it had.

The marriage ceremony included joining hands and the bridegroom uttering a formula of acceptance, such as, &quot;I am the son of nobles, silver and gold shall fill thy lap, thou shalt be my wife, I will be thy husband. Like the fruit of a garden I will give thee offspring.&quot; The ceremony must be performed by a freeman.

The marriage contract—without which, the Code ruled that the woman was no wife—usually stated the consequences to which each party was liable for repudiating the other. These by no means necessarily agree with the Code. Many other conditions might also be inserted: such as that the wife should act as maidservant to her mother-in-law or to a first wife.

The married couple formed a single unit in terms of external responsibility, especially for debt. The man was responsible for debts contracted by his wife, even before her marriage, as well as for his own; but he could use her as a &quot;mancipium&quot; (see above). Hence the Code allowed a proviso to be inserted in the marriage contract, that the wife should not be seized for her husband&#x27;s pre-nuptial debts; but stipulated that then he was not responsible for her pre-nuptial debts, and, in any case, that both together were responsible for all debts contracted after marriage. A man might make his wife a settlement by deed of gift, which gave her a life interest in part of his property, and he might reserve to her the right to bequeath it to a favorite child; but she could in no case leave it to her family. Although married, she always remained a member of her father&#x27;s house—she is rarely named wife of A, but usually daughter of B, or mother of C.

===Divorce===
Divorce was the husband&#x27;s option, but he had to restore the dowry, and if the wife had borne him children, she had custody of them. He then had to assign her the income from property, as well as goods to maintain herself and their children until they grew up. She shared equally with their children in the allowance (and apparently in his estate at his death) and was free to marry again. If she had no children, he returned her dowry to her and paid her a sum equivalent to the bride-price, or a mina of silver if there had been none. The latter is the usually named in the contract for his repudiation of her.

If the husband could show that his wife had been a bad wife, the Code allowed him to send her away, while he kept the children as well as her dowry; or he could degrade her to the position of a slave in his own house, where she would have food and clothing. The wife might bring an action against her husband for cruelty and neglect and, if she proved her case, obtain a judicial separation, taking her dowry with her. No other punishment fell on the man. If she did not prove her case, but was proved to be a bad wife, she was drowned.

If the wife was left without maintenance during an involuntary absence of her husband (called to war, etc.), she could cohabit with another man, but must return to her husband when he came back, the children of the second union remaining with their own father. If she had maintenance, a breach of the marriage tie was adultery. Willful desertion by, or exile of, the husband dissolved the marriage without penalty to the wife. If he returned, she was not required or even permitted to return to him.

===Widowhood===
A widow took her husband&#x27;s place in the family—living in his house and bringing up the children. She could only remarry with judicial consent, where the judge inventoried the deceased&#x27;s estate and handed it over to her and her new husband in trust for the children. They could not alienate a single utensil.

If she did not remarry, she lived on in her husband&#x27;s house and, when the children had grown up, took a child&#x27;s share in the division of his estate. She retained her dowry and any settlement deeded to her by her husband. This property would come down to her children on her death. If she had remarried, all her children would share equally in her dowry, but the first husband&#x27;s estate fell only to his children, or to her selection among them, if so empowered.

===Childbearing===
Monogamy was the rule, and a childless wife might give her husband a maid to bear him children, who were then reckoned hers. She remained mistress of her maid, and might degrade her to slavery again for insolence, but could not sell her if she had borne her husband children. If the wife did this, the Code did not allow the husband to take a concubine; but if she did not, he could do so. The concubine was a co-wife, though not of the same rank; the first wife had no power over her. A concubine was a free woman, often dowered for marriage, and her children were legitimate and lawful heirs. She could only be divorced on the same conditions as a wife.

If a wife became a chronic invalid, the husband was bound to maintain her in the home they had made together, unless she preferred to take her dowry and return to her father&#x27;s house; but he was free to remarry. Again, the children of the new wife were legitimate and lawful heirs.

There was no hindrance to a man having children by a slave girl. These children were free, and their mother then could not be sold, though she might be pledged, and she became free upon her master&#x27;s death. Her children could be legitimized by their father&#x27;s acknowledgment before witnesses and were often adopted. They then ranked equally in sharing their father&#x27;s estate; but if not adopted, the wife&#x27;s children divided and took first choice.

Temple priests were not supposed to have children, yet they could marry and often did. The Code contemplated that such a wife would give a husband a maid, as above.

Free women might marry slaves and still be dowered for the marriage. The children were free, and at the slave&#x27;s death, the wife took her dowry and half of what she and her husband had acquired in wedlock for self and children; the master taking the other half, as his slave&#x27;s heir.

A father had control over his children until their marriage. He had a right to their labor in return for their keep. He might hire them out and receive their wages, pledge them for debt, or even sell them outright. Mothers had the same rights in the absence of the father; elder brothers, when both parents were dead. A father had no claim on his married children for support, but they retained the right to inherit on his death.

The daughter was not only in her father&#x27;s power to be given in marriage, but he might dedicate her to the service of a god as a vestal or a hierodule or give her as a concubine. She had no choice in these matters, often decided in her childhood. An adult daughter might wish to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial marriage, and it seems that her father could not refuse her wish.

In all these cases, the father might dower her. If he did not, on his death the brothers were obligated to do so, giving her a full child&#x27;s share if a wife, a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child&#x27;s share if she were a hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter had the privilege of exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her property. All other daughters had only a life interest in their dowry, which reverted to their family if childless or went to their children if they had any. A father might, however, execute a deed granting a daughter power to leave her property to a favorite brother or sister.

A daughter&#x27;s estate was usually managed for her by her brothers, but if they dissatisfied her, she could appoint a steward. If she married, her husband then managed it. Sons also appear to have received their share on marriage, but then did not always leave their father&#x27;s house; they might bring their wives there. This was usual in child marriages.

===Adoption===
Adoption was very common, especially when the father (or mother) was childless or had seen all his children grow up and marry away. The child was then adopted to care for the parents&#x27; old age. This was done by contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what maintenance was expected. The natural children, if any, were usually consenting parties to an arrangement that cut off their expectations. In some cases they even acquired the estate for the adopted child who was to relieve them of care. If the adopted child failed to carry out the filial duty, the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were often adopted, and if they proved unfilial, were reduced to slavery again.

A craftsman often adopted a son to learn the craft. He profited by the son&#x27;s labour. If he failed to teach his son the craft, that son could prosecute him and get the contract annulled. This was a form of apprenticeship, and it is not clear whether the apprentice had any filial relation.

A man who had adopted a child, and afterwards married and had a family of his own, could dissolve the contract and must give the adopted child one-third of a child&#x27;s share in goods, but no real estate. Property could only descend through his legitimate family. Vestals frequently adopted daughters, usually other vestals, to care for them in their old age.

Adoption had to be with consent of the natural parents, who usually executed a deed making over the child, who thus ceased to have any claim upon them. But vestals, hierodules, certain palace officials and slaves had no rights over their children and could raise no objection. Orphans and illegitimate children had no parents to object. Ingratitude by adopted children was severely frowned on by the law: if the adopted child of a prostitute abandoned his foster parents and returned to his biological father&#x27;s house, his eye was torn out. If an adopted child rejected his foster parents, claiming they were not his mother and father, his tongue was torn out. An adopted child was a full heir; the contract might even assign him the position of eldest son. Usually, he was residuary legatee.

===Inheritance===
All legitimate children shared equally in the father&#x27;s estate on his death, reservation being made of a bride-price for an unmarried son, dower for a daughter, or property deeded to favourite children by the father. There was no birthright attaching to the position of eldest son, but he usually acted as executor and, after considering what each had already received, equalized the shares. He even made grants in excess to the others from his own share. If there were two widows with legitimate issue, both families shared equally in the father&#x27;s estate, until later times, when the first family took two-thirds. Daughters, in the absence of sons, had sons&#x27; rights. Children also shared their own mother&#x27;s property, but had no share in that of a stepmother.

A father could disinherit a son in early times without restriction, but the Code insisted upon judicial consent, and that only for repeated unfilial conduct. In early times, the son who denied his father had his front hair shorn and a slave-mark put on him and could be sold as a slave; while the son who denied his mother had his front hair shorn, was driven round the city as an example and expelled from his home, but not degraded to slavery.

===Adultery===
Adultery was punished with the death of both parties by drowning; but if the husband was willing to pardon his wife, the king might intervene to pardon the paramour. For incest between mother and son, both were burned to death; with a stepmother, the man was disinherited; with a daughter, the man was exiled; with a daughter-in-law, he was drowned; with a son&#x27;s fiancée, he was fined. A wife who for her lover&#x27;s sake procured her husband&#x27;s death was gibbeted. A betrothed girl seduced by her prospective father-in-law took her dowry and returned to her family and was free to marry as she chose.

==Punishment==
In the criminal code, the ruling vice-principle was the &quot;lex talionis&quot;. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, limb for limb was the penalty for assault upon an &quot;amelu&quot;. A sort of symbolic retaliation was the punishment for the offender, seen in cutting off the hand that struck a father or stole a trust; in cutting off the breast of a wet nurse who switched the child entrusted to her for another; in the loss of the tongue that denied father or mother (in Elamite contracts, the same penalty was inflicted for perjury); in the loss of the eye that pried into forbidden secrets. The loss of the surgeon&#x27;s hand that caused loss of life or limb, or the brander&#x27;s hand that obliterated a slave&#x27;s identification mark, are very similar. The slave who struck a freeman or denied his master lost an ear, the organ of hearing and symbol of obedience. A person who brought another into danger of death by false accusation was punished by death. A perjurer was punished by the same penalty the perjurer sought to bring upon another.

The death penalty was freely rendered for theft and other crimes in this section of the Code: for theft involving entering a palace or temple treasury, for illegal purchase from a minor or slave, for selling stolen goods or receiving the same, for common theft in the open (in lieu of multiple-fold restoration) or receiving the same, for false claim to goods, for kidnapping, for assisting or harbouring fugitive slaves, for detaining or appropriating the same, for brigandage, for fraudulent sale of drink, for not reporting criminal conspiracy in one&#x27;s tavern, for delegation of personal service and refusing to pay the delegate or not sending the delegate, for misappropriating the levy, for harming or robbing one of the king&#x27;s captains, for causing the death of a house owner through bad construction. The manner of death is not specified for these cases.

This death penalty was also set for conduct that placed another in danger of death. The form of death penalty was specified for the following cases: gibbeting: for burglary (on the spot where crime was committed), later also for encroaching on the king&#x27;s highway, for getting a slave-brand obliterated, for procuring a husband&#x27;s death; burning: for incest with own mother, for a vestal entering or opening a tavern, for looting a house on fire (thrown into the fire); drowning: for adultery, rape of a betrothed maiden, bigamy, bad conduct as a wife, seduction of a daughter-in-law.

A curious extension of the &quot;lex talionis&quot; is the death of a creditor&#x27;s son for his father&#x27;s having caused the death of a debtor&#x27;s son as &quot;mancipium&quot;; of a builder&#x27;s son for his father&#x27;s causing the death of a house owner&#x27;s son by bad construction; the death of a man&#x27;s daughter because her father caused the death of another man&#x27;s daughter.

Contracts naturally do not usually touch on criminal matters as the above, but marriage contracts do specify death by strangling, drowning, precipitation from a tower or pinnacle of the temple, or by the iron sword, for a wife&#x27;s repudiation of her husband. We are quite without evidence as to the executioner in all these cases.

Exile was inflicted for incest with a daughter; disinheritance for incest with a stepmother, or for repeated unfilial conduct. Sixty strokes of an ox-hide scourge were awarded for a brutal assault on a superior, both being &quot;amelu&quot;. Branding (perhaps the equivalent of degradation to slavery) was the penalty for slander of a married woman or vestal. Permanent deprivation of office fell upon the corrupt judge. Enslavement befell the extravagant wife and unfilial children. Imprisonment was common, but is not mentioned in the Code.

The commonest of all penalties was a fine. This is awarded by the Code for corporal injuries to a &quot;mushkenu&quot; or to a slave (paid to his master), for damages done to property, or for breach of contract. The restoration of goods appropriated, illegally bought, or damaged by neglect, was usually accompanied by a fine, giving it the form of multiple restoration. This might be double, treble, fourfold, fivefold, sixfold, tenfold, twelvefold, or even thirtyfold, according to the enormity of the offence.

The Code recognized the importance of intent. A man who killed another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally and was then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does not say what would be the penalty of murder, but death is so often awarded where death is caused, that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional, the assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor&#x27;s fees. A brander, induced to remove a slave&#x27;s identification mark, could swear to his ignorance and was free. The owner of an ox that gored a man on the street was only responsible for damages if the ox was known by him to be vicious—even if it caused death. If the &quot;mancipium&quot; died a natural death under the creditor&#x27;s hand, the creditor was free. In ordinary cases, a person was not responsible for accident or if they exercised more than proper care. Poverty excused bigamy on the part of a deserted wife.

On the other hand, carelessness and neglect were severely punished, as in the case of the unskillful physician, if it led to loss of life or limb, his hands were cut off; a slave had to be replaced, the loss of his eye paid for by half his value; a veterinary surgeon who caused the death of an ox or donkey paid quarter value; a builder whose careless workmanship caused death died or paid for it by the death of his child, replaced slave or goods and in any case, had to rebuild the house or make good any damages due to defective building and repair the defect as well. The boat builder had to make good any defect of construction or damage due to it for a year&#x27;s warranty.

Throughout the Code, respect is paid to evidence. Suspicion was not enough. The criminal must be taken in the act, e.g. the adulterer, etc. A man could not be convicted of theft unless the goods were found in his possession.

In the case of a lawsuit, the plaintiff proffered his own plea. There is no trace of professional advocates, but the plea had to be in writing, and the notary doubtlessly assisted in the drafting of it. The judge saw the plea, called the other parties before him, and sent for the witnesses. If these were not at hand, he might adjourn the case for their subpoena, specifying a time for up to six months. Pledges might be made to produce the witnesses on a fixed day.

The more important cases, especially those involving life and death, were tried by a bench of judges. With the judges were associated a body of elders who shared in the decision, but whose exact function is not yet clear. Agreements, declarations and non-contentious cases were usually witnessed by one judge and twelve elders.

Parties and witnesses were put on oath. The penalty for false witness was usually the punishment that would have been awarded the victim if convicted. In matters beyond human knowledge, such as the guilt or innocence of an alleged practitioner of magic or a suspected wife, the ordeal by water was used. The accused jumped into the sacred river, and the innocent swam while the guilty drowned. The accused could clear himself by taking an oath if the only knowledge available was his own. The plaintiff could swear to his loss by brigands, the price paid for a slave purchased abroad, or the sum due to him; but great stress was laid on the production of written evidence. It was a serious thing to lose a document. The judges might be satisfied of its existence and terms by the affidavit of the witnesses to it and then issue an order that whenever found, it should be submitted. The clay tablets of contracts that were annulled were broken. The court might even travel to view the property and take with them the sacred symbols with which oaths were made.

Court decisions were set in writing, sealed and witnessed by the judges, the elders, witnesses, and a scribe. Women might act in all these capacities. The parties swore an oath, included in the document, to observe its stipulations. Each party received a copy, and one was kept by the scribe to be stored in the archives.

Appeal to the king was allowed and is well attested. The judges at Babylon seem to have formed a superior court to those of provincial towns, but a defendant might elect to answer the charge before the local court and refuse to plead at Babylon.

Finally, it may be noted that many immoral acts, such as the use of false weights, lying, etc., that could not be brought into court are severely denounced in the Omen Tablets as likely to bring the offender into &quot;the hand of God&quot; as opposed to &quot;the hand of the king&quot;.

<doc id="58227" wikidata="Q170054" url="?curid=58227" title="Arcadia (regional unit)">
<text>Arcadia ( ) is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the administrative region of Peloponnese. It is in the central and eastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. It takes its name from the mythological figure Arcas. In Greek mythology, it was the home of the god Pan.

==Geography==
Arcadia is a rural, mountainous regional unit comprising about 18% of the land area of the Peloponnese peninsula. It is the peninsula&#x27;s largest regional unit. According to the 2021 census, it has 77,592 inhabitants; its capital, Tripoli, has about 30,400 residents in the city proper, and about 44,000 total in the greater metropolitan area.

Arcadia consists partly of farmland, and to a larger extent grassland and degenerated shrubland. It also has three mountain ranges, with forestation mainly at altitudes above 1000 meters: Mainalo, a winter ski resort, situated in the central north; Parnon in the central south; and Mount Lykaion, famous for the ancient history and myths associated with it, in the southwest.

Its climate features hot summers and mild winters in the east, the south, and those parts of the central area that are less than 1000 meters above sea level. Fall and winter are mostly rainy, except in the mountains to the west and north, Taygetus and Mainalo, which are snowy in winter.

==Geology and Hydrogeology==

Arcadia is almost totally mountainous and part of the &quot;carbonate platform&quot; (calcareous or limestone deposits) of the Peloponnese. The whole peninsula was formed by intense tectonics (faults, overthrusts and regional metamorphism). In Arcadia&#x27;s central part around the Tripoli region developed a special form of topography, a geologically fascinating phenomenon: There are several plains and &quot;intra mountainous basins&quot;, even &quot;closed basins&quot;: The 30 km long &quot;Tripoli-Plateau&quot;, &quot;Argon Pedion&quot;, Basin of Levidi, Basin of Vlacherna Arcadia/Hotoussa/Kandila.

The peculiarity of the plains and basins is a result of intensive karstification: Water seeps into the underground, rather than eroding and draining the topography by surface waterways. All drainage runs through ponors (in Greek: καταβόθρες) and subterranean waterways. The additional problem for rural activities in the basins: When winter rains are heavy, the ground is flooded or temporary lakes arise, even today, as drainage through katavothres is often too slow to start cultivation in due time.

==History==

===Ancient history===


===Medieval history===
After the collapse of the Roman Empire in the west, Arcadia remained as part of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire. Arcadia remained a beautiful, secluded area, and its inhabitants became proverbial as herdsmen leading simple pastoral unsophisticated yet happy lives, to the point that &quot;Arcadia&quot; may refer to some imaginary idyllic paradise, immortalized by Virgil&#x27;s Eclogues, and later by Jacopo Sannazaro in his pastoral masterpiece, &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1504); see also Arcadia (utopia).

After the Fourth Crusade, the area became a part of the Principality of Achaea, but was progressively recovered by the Byzantine Greeks of the Despotate of the Morea from the 1260s on, a process that was completed in 1320. The region fell into the hands of the Ottoman Turks along with the rest of the Despotate in 1460. With the exception of a period of Venetian rule in 1687–1715, the region remained under Turkish control until 1821.

The Latin phrase &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot;, which is usually interpreted to mean &quot;Even in Arcadia there am I&quot;, is an example of &quot;memento mori&quot;, a cautionary reminder of the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of death. The phrase is most often associated with a 1647 painting by Nicolas Poussin, also known as &quot;The Arcadian Shepherds&quot;. In the painting the phrase appears as an inscription on a tomb discovered by youthful figures in classical garb.

===Modern history===
Arcadia was one of the centres of the Greek War of Independence which saw victories in their battles including one in Tripoli. After a victorious revolutionary war, Arcadia was finally incorporated into the newly created Greek state. Arcadia saw economic growth and small emigration.

In the 20th century, Arcadia experienced extensive population loss through emigration, mostly to the Americas. Many Arcadian villages lost half their inhabitants, and fears arose that they would turn into ghost towns. Arcadia now has a smaller population than Corinthia. Demographers expected that its population would halve between 1951 and the early 21st century. The population has fallen to 87,000 in 2011.

An earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter magnitude scale shook Megalopoli and the surrounding area in 1965. Large numbers of buildings were destroyed, leaving people homeless. Within a couple of years, the buildings were rebuilt anti-seismically. This earthquake revealed an underground source of lignite in the area, and in 1967 construction began on the Megalopoli Power Plant, which began operating in 1970. The mining area south of the plant is the largest mining area in the peninsula and continues to the present day with one settlement moved.

In July and August 2007 forest fires caused damage in Arcadia, notably in the mountains.

In 2008, a theory proposed by classicist Christos Mergoupis suggested that the mummified remains of Alexander the Great (not his actual tomb), may in fact be located in Gortynia-Arkadia, in the Peloponnese of Greece. Since 2008, this research is ongoing and currently being conducted in Greece. The research was first mentioned on CNN International in May 2008.

==Language==
When, during the Greek Dark Ages (c. 1200 BC–800 BC), Doric Greek was introduced to the Peloponnese, the older Arcadocypriot Greek language apparently survived in Arcadia. Arcadocypriot never became a literary dialect, but it is known from inscriptions. Tsan is a letter of the Greek alphabet occurring only in Arcadia, shaped like Cyrillic И; it represents an affricate that developed from labiovelars in context where they became &quot;t&quot; in other dialects.

The Tsakonian language, still spoken on the coast of modern Arcadia (but in the Classical period considered the southern Argolid coast immediately adjoining Arcadia), is a descendant of Doric Greek, and as such is an exceptional example of a surviving regional dialect of archaic Greek. The principal cities of Tsakonia are the Arcadian coastal towns of Leonidio and Tyros.

==Administration==


The regional unit Arcadia is subdivided into five municipalities. (Numbered as on map in infobox):
*Gortynia (3)
*Megalopoli (5)
*North Kynouria (&quot;Voreia Kynouria&quot;, 2)
*South Kynouria (&quot;Notia Kynouria&quot;, 4)
*Tripoli (1)

===Prefecture===

As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Arcadia was created out of the former prefecture Arcadia (). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.

===Provinces===
Arcadia was divided into four provinces:
*Province of Gortynia—Dimitsana
*Province of Kynouria—Leonidio
*Province of Mantineia—Tripolis
*Province of Megalopoli—Megalopolis
&quot;Note:&quot; Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.

===Ancient and modern towns and cities===
The main towns in modern Arcadia are Tripoli, Astros, Vytina, Dimitsana, Lagkadia, Tyros, Leonidio, Levidi, Megalopoli and Stemnitsa.

Ancient cities include Acacesium, Asea, Astros, Athinaio, Daseae, Falaisia (Phalesia), Gortys, Hypsus (Stemnitsa), Heraia, Lusi, Lykaio, Lycosura, Mantineia, Megalopolis, Orchomenus (Orchomenos), Tegea, Thoknia, Trapezus, Trikolonoi, Tropaia, Tripoli, Tyros, other cities includes Basilis, Caphyae, Charisia, Ellison, Enispe, Kaous, Karyes, Methydrio, Melangeia, Oryx, Paroria, Pelagos, Rhipe, Stratia, Teuthis and several more. Cities which once belonged in Arcadia include Alea (now in Argolis), Amilos (now in Achaia), and Phigalia (now in Elis).

==Economy==

A thermoelectric power station which produces electricity for most of southern Greece, operates to the south of Megalopolis, along with a coal mine.

In agriculture, potato farms (dominant in central and northcentral Arcadia), mixed farming, olive groves, and pasture dominate the plains of Arcadia, especially in the area around Megalopolis and between Tripoli and Levidi.

==Transportation==
The A7 motorway (E65) highway connects Tripoli with Corinth and Athens. It is being extended further southwest to Megalopoli and Kalamata.

<doc id="58229" wikidata="Q331341" url="?curid=58229" title="Bacchanalia">
<text>The Bacchanalia were unofficial, privately funded popular Roman festivals of Bacchus, based on various ecstatic elements of the Greek Dionysia. They were almost certainly associated with Rome&#x27;s native cult of Liber, and probably arrived in Rome itself around 200 BC. Like all mystery religions of the ancient world, very little is known of their rites. They seem to have been popular and well-organised throughout the central and southern Italian peninsula.

Livy, writing some 200 years after the event, offers a scandalized and extremely colourful account of the Bacchanalia, with frenzied rites, sexually violent initiations of both sexes, all ages and all social classes; he represents the cult as a murderous instrument of conspiracy against the state. Livy claims that seven thousand cult leaders and followers were arrested, and that most were executed. Livy believed the Bacchanalia scandal to be one of several indications of Rome&#x27;s inexorable moral decay. Modern scholars take a skeptical approach to Livy&#x27;s allegations.

The cult was not banned. Senatorial legislation to reform the Bacchanalia in 186 BC attempted to control their size, organisation, and priesthoods, under threat of the death penalty. This may have been motivated less by the kind of lurid and dramatic rumours that Livy describes than by the Senate&#x27;s determination to assert its civil, moral and religious authority over Rome and its allies, after the prolonged social, political and military crisis of the Second Punic War (218–201 BC). The reformed Bacchanalia rites may have been merged with the Liberalia festival. Bacchus, Liber and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable from the late Republican era (133 BC and onward), and their mystery cults persisted well into the Principate of the Roman Imperial era.

==Background and development==

The Bacchanalia were Roman festivals of Bacchus, the Greco-Roman god of wine, freedom, intoxication and ecstasy. They were based on the Greek Dionysia and the Dionysian Mysteries, and probably arrived in Rome c. 200 BC via the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and from Etruria, Rome&#x27;s northern neighbour. Tenney Frank suggests that some form of Dionysian worship may have been introduced to Rome by captives from the formerly Greek city of Tarentum in southern Italy, captured from the Carthaginians in 209 BC. Like all mystery cults, the Bacchanalia were held in strict privacy, and initiates were bound to secrecy; what little is known of the cult and its rites derives from Greek and Roman literature, plays, statuary and paintings. One of the earliest sources is Greek playwright Euripides&#x27;s &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, which won the Athenian Dionysia competition in 405 BC. The Bacchanalia may have had mystery elements and public elements; religious dramas which were performed in public, and private rites performed by acolytes and priests of the deity.

Livy, the principal Roman literary source on the early Bacchanalia, names Paculla Annia, a Campanian priestess of Bacchus, as the founder of a private, unofficial Bacchanalia cult in Rome, based at the grove of Stimula, where the western slope of the Aventine Hill descends to the Tiber. The Aventine was an ethnically mixed district, strongly identified with Rome&#x27;s plebeian class and the ingress of new and foreign cults. The wine and fertility god Liber Pater (&quot;The Free Father&quot;), divine patron of plebeian rights, freedoms and augury, had a long-established official cult in the nearby temple he shared with Ceres and Libera. Most Roman sources describe him as Rome&#x27;s equivalent to Dionysus and Bacchus, both of whom were sometimes titled &quot;Eleutherios&quot; (liberator).

== Bacchanalia scandal ==
Livy claims the earliest version of the Bacchanalia was open to women only, and held on three days of the year, in daylight; while in nearby Etruria, north of Rome, a &quot;Greek of humble origin, versed in sacrifices and soothsaying&quot; had established a nocturnal version, added wine and feasting to the mix, and thus acquired an enthusiastic following of women and men. The nocturnal version of the Bacchanalia involved wine-drinking to excess drunkenness and the free mingling of the sexes and classes; the rites also involved loud music.

According to Livy&#x27;s account, Publius Aebutius of the gens Aebutia was warned against the cult and its excesses by a courtesan, Hispala Faecenia. The Senate appointed Spurius Postumius Albinus and Quintus Marcius Philippus to investigate the cult. The inquiry claimed that under the cover of religion, priests and acolytes broke civil, moral and religious laws with impunity; weak-minded individuals could be persuaded to commit ritual or political murders undetected, at the behest of those who secretly controlled the cult, right in the heart of Rome. Livy claims that the cult held particular appeal to those of uneducated and fickle mind (&quot;levitas animi&quot;), such as the young, plebeians, women and &quot;men most like women&quot;, and that most of the city&#x27;s population was involved, even some members of Rome&#x27;s highest class.

==Reform==

The Legislation of 186 survives in the form of an inscription. Known as the &quot;Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus&quot;, it brought the Bacchanalia under control of the Senate, and thus of the Roman pontifices. The existing cult chapters and colleges were dismantled. Congregations of mixed gender were permitted, but were limited to no more than two men and three women, and any Bacchanalia gathering must seek prior permission from the Senate. Men were forbidden Bacchus&#x27;s priesthood.

Despite their official suppression, illicit Bacchanals persisted covertly for many years, particularly in Southern Italy, their likely place of origin. The reformed, officially approved Bacchic cults would have borne little resemblance to the earlier crowded, ecstatic and uninhibited Bacchanalia. Similar attrition may have been imposed on Liber&#x27;s cults; his perceived or actual association with the Bacchanalia may be the reason that his Liberalia &quot;ludi&quot; of 17 March were temporarily moved to Ceres&#x27; Cerealia of 12–19 April. They were restored when the ferocity of reaction eased, but in approved, much modified form.
==Interpretations==
Livy&#x27;s account of the Bacchanalia has been described as &quot;tendentious to say the least&quot;. As a political and social conservative, he had a deep mistrust of mystery religions, and probably understood any form of Bacchanalia as a sign of Roman degeneracy. Though most of his &quot;dramatis personae&quot; are known historical figures, their speeches are implausibly circumstantial, and his characters, tropes and plot developments draw more from Roman satyr plays than from the Bacchanalia themselves. Paculla Annia is unlikely to have introduced all the changes he attributes to her.

For Livy, the cult&#x27;s greatest offences arose from indiscriminate mixing of freeborn Romans of both sexes and all ages at night, a time when passions are easily aroused, especially given wine and unrestricted opportunity. Women at these gatherings, he says, outnumbered men; and his account has the consul Postumius stress the overwhelmingly female nature and organization of the cult. Yet the &quot;Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus&quot; itself allows women to outnumber men, by three to two, at any permitted gathering; and it expressly forbids Bacchic priesthoods to men. Livy&#x27;s own narrative names all but one of the offending cult leaders as male, which seems to eliminate any perceived &quot;conspiracy of women&quot;. Gender seems to have motivated the Senate&#x27;s response no more than any other cause.

Livy&#x27;s consistent negative description of the cult&#x27;s Greek origins and low moral character—not even Bacchus is exempt from this judgment—may have sought to justify its suppression as a sudden &quot;infiltration of too many Greek elements into Roman worship&quot;. The cult had, however, been active in Rome for many years before its supposedly abrupt discovery, and Bacchic and Dionysiac cults had been part of life in Roman and allied, Greek-speaking Italy for many decades. Greek cults and Greek influences had been part of Rome&#x27;s religious life since the 5th century BC, and Rome&#x27;s acquisition of foreign cults—Greek or otherwise—through the alliance, treaty, capture or conquest was a cornerstone of its foreign policy, and an essential feature of its eventual hegemony. While the pace of such introductions had gathered rapidly during the 3rd century, contemporary evidence of the Bacchanalia reform betrays no anti-Greek or anti-foreign policy or sentiment.

Gruen interprets the &quot;Senatus consultum&quot; as a piece of &quot;Realpolitik&quot;, a display of the Roman senate&#x27;s authority to its Italian allies after the Second Punic War, and a reminder to any Roman politician, populist and would-be generalissimo that the Senate&#x27;s collective authority trumped all personal ambition. Nevertheless, the extent and ferocity of the official response to the Bacchanalia was probably unprecedented, and betrays some form of moral panic on the part of Roman authorities; Burkert finds &quot;nothing comparable in religious history before the persecutions of Christians&quot;.

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, &quot;bacchanalia&quot; can mean any uninhibited or drunken revelry. The bacchanal in art describes any small group of revelers, often including satyrs and perhaps Bacchus or Silenus, usually in a landscape setting. The subject was popular from the Renaissance onwards, and usually included a large degree of nudity among the figures.

<doc id="58230" wikidata="Q133337" url="?curid=58230" title="Solon">
<text>Solon (;  BC) was an archaic Athenian statesman, lawmaker, political philosopher, and poet. He is one of the Seven Sages of Greece and credited with laying the foundations for Athenian democracy. Solon&#x27;s efforts to legislate against political, economic and moral decline resulted in his constitutional reform overturning most of Draco&#x27;s laws. 

Solon&#x27;s reforms included debt relief later known and celebrated among Athenians as the (shaking off of burdens). He is described by Aristotle in the &quot;Athenian Constitution&quot; as &quot;the first people&#x27;s champion&quot;. Demosthenes credited Solon&#x27;s reforms with starting a golden age.

Modern knowledge of Solon is limited by the fact that his works only survive in fragments and appear to feature interpolations by later authors. It is further limited by the general paucity of documentary and archaeological evidence covering Athens in the early 6th century BC. 

Ancient authors such as Philo of Alexandria, Herodotus, and Plutarch are the main sources, but wrote about Solon long after his death. Fourth-century BC orators, such as Aeschines, tended to attribute to Solon all the laws of their own, much later times.

==Biography==

=== Early life and ancestry ===
Solon was born in Athens around 630 BC. His family was distinguished in Attica as they belonged to a noble or Eupatrid clan. Solon&#x27;s father was probably Execestides. If so, his lineage could be traced back to Codrus, the last King of Athens. According to Diogenes Laërtius, he had a brother named Dropides, who was an ancestor (six generations removed) of Plato. According to Plutarch, Solon was related to the tyrant Pisistratus, for their mothers were cousins. Solon was eventually drawn into the unaristocratic pursuit of commerce.

=== Defeat of Megara ===
When Athens and its neighbor and rival in the Saronic Gulf, Megara, were contesting the possession of Salamis, Solon was made leader of the Athenian forces. After repeated disasters, Solon was able to improve the morale of his troops through a nationalist poem he wrote about the island. Supported by Pisistratus, he defeated the Megarians either by means of a cunning trick or more directly through heroic battle around 595 BC. The Megarians, however, refused to give up their claim. The dispute was referred to the Spartans, who eventually awarded possession of the island to Athens on the strength of the case that Solon put to them. Plutarch professes admiration of Solon&#x27;s elegy. The same poem was said by Diogenes Laërtius to have stirred Athenians more than any other verses that Solon wrote:

One fragment describes assorted breads and cakes:

=== Archonship ===
According to Diogenes Laertius, in 594 BC, Solon was chosen archon, or chief magistrate. Solon repealed all of Draco&#x27;s laws except those relating to homicide. 

During Solon&#x27;s time, many Greek city-states had seen the emergence of tyrants, opportunistic noblemen who had taken power on behalf of sectional interests. Solon was described by Plutarch as having been temporarily awarded autocratic powers by Athenian citizens on the grounds that he had the wisdom to sort out their differences for them in a peaceful and equitable manner. Some modern scholars believe these powers were in fact granted some years after Solon had been archon, when he would have been a member of the Areopagus and probably a more respected statesman by his peers. 

As archon, Solon discussed his intended reforms with some friends. Knowing that he was about to cancel all debts, these friends took out loans and promptly bought some land. Suspected of complicity, Solon complied with his own law and released his own debtors, amounting to five talents (or 15 according to some sources). His friends never repaid their debts.

=== Travels ===

After completing his work of reform, Solon surrendered his extraordinary authority and traveled abroad for ten years, so that the Athenians could not induce him to repeal any of his laws.

Within four years of Solon&#x27;s departure, the old social rifts re-appeared, but with some new complications. There were irregularities in the new governmental procedures, elected officials sometimes refused to stand down from their posts and occasionally important posts were left vacant. It has even been said that some people blamed Solon for their troubles. Eventually one of Solon&#x27;s relatives, Pisistratus, ended the factionalism by force, thus instituting an unconstitutionally gained tyranny. In Plutarch&#x27;s account, Solon accused Athenians of stupidity and cowardice for allowing this to happen.

Solon&#x27;s first stop in his travels was Egypt. There, according to Herodotus, he visited the Pharaoh of Egypt, Amasis II. According to Plutarch, he spent some time and discussed philosophy with two Egyptian priests, Psenophis of Heliopolis and Sonchis of Sais. A character in two of Plato&#x27;s dialogues, &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot;, claims Solon visited Neith&#x27;s temple at Sais and received from the priests there an account of the history of Atlantis. Next, Solon sailed to Cyprus, where he oversaw the construction of a new capital for a local king, in gratitude for which the king named it Soloi.

Solon&#x27;s travels finally brought him to Sardis, capital of Lydia. According to Herodotus and Plutarch, he met with Croesus and gave the Lydian king advice, which Croesus failed to appreciate until it was too late. Croesus had considered himself to be the happiest man alive and Solon had advised him, &quot;Count no man happy until he be dead.&quot; The reasoning was that at any minute, fortune might turn on even the happiest man and make his life miserable. It was only after he had lost his kingdom to the Persian king Cyrus, while awaiting execution, that Croesus acknowledged the wisdom of Solon&#x27;s advice.

=== Death and legacy ===
After his return to Athens, Solon became a staunch opponent of Pisistratus. In protest, and as an example to others, Solon stood outside his own home in full armour, urging all who passed to resist the machinations of the would-be tyrant. His efforts were in vain. Solon died shortly after Pisistratus usurped by force the autocratic power that Athens had once freely bestowed upon him. Solon died in Cyprus around the age of 70 and, in accordance with his will, his ashes were scattered around Salamis, the island where he was born.

Pausanias listed Solon among the Seven Sages, whose aphorisms adorned Apollo&#x27;s temple in Delphi. Stobaeus in the Florilegium relates a story about a symposium where Solon&#x27;s young nephew was singing a poem of Sappho&#x27;s: Solon, upon hearing the song, asked the boy to teach him to sing it. When someone asked, &quot;Why should you waste your time on it?&quot;, Solon replied, &quot;&quot;, &quot;So that I may learn it before I die.&quot; Ammianus Marcellinus, however, told a similar story about Socrates and the poet Stesichorus, quoting the philosopher&#x27;s rapture in almost identical terms: , meaning &quot;in order to leave life knowing a little more&quot;.

==Historical rivalries==
The social and political upheavals that characterized Athens in Solon&#x27;s time have been variously interpreted by historians from ancient times to the present day. The historical account of Solon&#x27;s Athens has evolved over many centuries into a set of contradictory stories or a complex story that might be interpreted in a variety of ways. As further evidence accumulates, and as historians continue to debate the issues, Solon&#x27;s motivations and the intentions behind his reforms will continue to attract speculation.

Two contemporary historians have identified three distinct historical accounts of Solon&#x27;s Athens, emphasizing quite different rivalries: economic and/or ideological rivalry, regional rivalry, and rivalry between aristocratic clans. These different accounts provide a convenient basis for an overview of the issues involved.

=== Economic and ideological ===

Economic and ideological rivalry is a common theme in ancient sources. This sort of account emerges from Solon&#x27;s poems, in which he casts himself in the role of a noble mediator between two intemperate and unruly factions. This same account is substantially taken up about three centuries later by the author of the Aristotelian &quot;Athenaion Politeia&quot; but with an interesting variation:

Here Solon is presented as a partisan in a democratic cause whereas, judged from the viewpoint of his own poems, he was instead a mediator between rival factions. A still more significant variation in the ancient historical account appears in the writing of Plutarch in the late 1st – early 2nd century AD:

===Regional ===
Regional rivalry is a theme commonly found among modern scholars. &quot;The new picture which emerged was one of strife between regional groups, united by local loyalties and led by wealthy landowners. Their goal was to take control of the central government at Athens and with it dominate over their rivals from other districts of Attica.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Regional factionalism was inevitable in a relatively large territory such as Athens possessed. In most Greek city states, a farmer could conveniently reside in a town and travel to and from his fields every day. According to Thucydides, on the other hand, most Athenians continued to live in rural settlements right up until the Peloponnesian War. The effects of regionalism in a large territory could be seen in Laconia, where Sparta had gained control through intimidation and resettlement of some of its neighbours and enslavement of the rest. Attika in Solon&#x27;s time seemed to be moving towards a similarly ugly solution with many citizens in danger of being reduced to the status of helots.

===Clan===
Rivalry between clans is a theme recently developed by some scholars, based on an appreciation of the political significance of kinship groupings. According to this account, bonds of kinship rather than local loyalties were the decisive influence on events in archaic Athens. An Athenian belonged not only to a phyle or tribe and one of its subdivisions, the phratry or brotherhood, but also to an extended family, clan or genos. It has been argued that these interconnecting units of kinship reinforced a hierarchic structure with aristocratic clans at the top. Thus rivalries between aristocratic clans could engage all levels of society irrespective of any regional ties. In that case, the struggle between rich and poor was the struggle between powerful aristocrats and the weaker affiliates of their rivals or perhaps even with their own rebellious affiliates.

==Solon&#x27;s reforms==
Solon&#x27;s laws were inscribed on , large wooden slabs or cylinders attached to a series of axles that stood upright in the Prytaneion. Originally the axones recorded laws enacted by Draco in the late 7th century (traditionally 621 BC). Nothing of Draco&#x27;s codification has survived except for a law relating to homicide, yet there is consensus among scholars that it did not amount to anything like a constitution. 

During his visit to Athens, Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer reported that the inscribed laws of Solon were still displayed by the Prytaneion. Fragments of the axones were still visible in Plutarch&#x27;s time but today the only records we have of Solon&#x27;s laws are fragmentary quotes and comments in literary sources such as those written by Plutarch himself. Moreover, the language of his laws was archaic even by the standards of the fifth century and this caused interpretation problems for ancient commentators. Modern scholars doubt the reliability of these sources and our knowledge of Solon&#x27;s legislation is therefore actually very limited in its details.

Generally, Solon&#x27;s reforms appear to have been constitutional, economic, moral, and sexual in their scope. This distinction, though somewhat artificial, does at least provide a convenient framework within which to consider the laws that have been attributed to Solon. Some short-term consequences of his reforms are considered at the end of the section. 

===Constitutional ===

Depending on how we interpret the historical facts known to us, Solon&#x27;s constitutional reforms were either a radical anticipation of democratic government, or they merely provided a plutocratic flavour to a stubbornly aristocratic regime, or else the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. 

Before Solon&#x27;s reforms, the Athenian state was administered by nine archons appointed or elected annually by the Areopagus on the basis of noble birth and wealth. There was an assembly of Athenian citizens (the Ekklesia) but the lowest class (the Thetes) was not admitted and its deliberative procedures were controlled by the nobles. There therefore seemed to be no means by which an archon could be called to account for breach of oath unless the Areopagus favoured his prosecution. 

According to the &quot;Athenian Constitution&quot;, Solon legislated for all citizens to be admitted into the Ekklesia and for a court (the Heliaia) to be formed from all the citizens. The Heliaia appears to have been the Ekklesia, or some representative portion of it, sitting as a jury. By giving common people the power not only to elect officials but also to call them to account, Solon appears to have established the foundations of a true republic.

====Classes====
There is consensus among scholars that Solon lowered the requirements – those that existed in terms of financial and social qualifications – which applied to election to public office. The Solonian constitution divided citizens into four political classes defined according to assessable property a classification that might previously have served the state for military or taxation purposes only. The standard unit for this assessment was one &quot;medimnos&quot; (approximately 12 gallons) of cereals and yet the kind of classification set out below might be considered too simplistic to be historically accurate.
**valued at 500 or more of cereals annually.
**eligible to serve as (generals or military governors)
**valued at 300 or more annually.
**approximating to the medieval class of knights, they had enough wealth to equip themselves for the cavalry
**valued at 200 or more annually.
**approximating to the medieval class of yeoman, they had enough wealth to equip themselves for the infantry (hoplite)
**valued up to 199 annually or less
**manual workers or sharecroppers, they served voluntarily in the role of personal servant, or as auxiliaries armed for instance with the sling or as rowers in the navy.

According to the &quot;Athenian Constitution&quot;, only the were eligible for election to high office as archons and therefore only they gained admission into the Areopagus. A modern view affords the same privilege to the . The top three classes were eligible for a variety of lesser posts and only the were excluded from all public office.

===Economic===
The real motives behind Solon&#x27;s economic reforms are as questionable as his real motives for constitutional reform. Were the poor being forced to serve the needs of a changing economy, was the economy being reformed to serve the needs of the poor, or were Solon&#x27;s policies the manifestation of a struggle taking place between poorer citizens and the aristocrats?

Solon&#x27;s economic reforms need to be understood in the context of the primitive, subsistence economy that prevailed both before and after his time. Most Athenians were still living in rural settlements right up to the Peloponnesian War. Opportunities for trade even within the Athenian borders were limited. The typical farming family, even in classical times, barely produced enough to satisfy its own needs. Opportunities for international trade were minimal. It has been estimated that, even in Roman times, goods rose 40% in value for every 100 miles they were carried over land, but only 1.3% for the same distance were they carried by ship and yet there is no evidence that Athens possessed any merchant ships until around 525 BC. Until then, the narrow warship doubled as a cargo vessel. Athens, like other Greek city states in the 7th century BC, was faced with increasing population pressures and by about 525 BC it was able to feed itself only in good years.

Solon&#x27;s reforms can thus be seen to have taken place at a crucial period of economic transition, when a subsistence rural economy increasingly required the support of a nascent commercial sector. The specific economic reforms credited to Solon are these:

*Fathers were encouraged to find trades for their sons; if they did not, there would be no legal requirement for sons to maintain their fathers in old age.
*Foreign tradesmen were encouraged to settle in Athens; those who did would be granted citizenship, provided they brought their families with them.
*Cultivation of olives was encouraged; the export of all other fruits was prohibited.
*Competitiveness of Athenian commerce was promoted through revision of weights and measures, possibly based on successful standards already in use elsewhere, such as Aegina or Euboia or, according to the ancient account but unsupported by modern scholarship, Argos.

==== Coinage ====
It is generally assumed, on the authority of ancient commentators, that Solon also reformed the Athenian coinage. However, recent numismatic studies now lead to the conclusion that Athens probably had no coinage until around 560 BC, well after Solon&#x27;s reforms. Nevertheless, there are now reasons to suggest that monetization had already begun before Solon&#x27;s reforms. By the early sixth century the Athenians were using silver in the form of a variety of bullion silver pieces for monetary payments. Drachma and obol as a term of bullion value had already been adopted, although the corresponding standard weights were probably unstable.

==== Foreign trade ====
Solon&#x27;s economic reforms succeeded in stimulating foreign trade. Athenian black-figure pottery was exported in increasing quantities and good quality throughout the Aegean between 600 BC and 560 BC, a success story that coincided with a decline in trade in Corinthian pottery. The ban on the export of grain might be understood as a relief measure for the benefit of the poor. However, the encouragement of olive production for export could actually have led to increased hardship for many Athenians to the extent that it led to a reduction in the amount of land dedicated to grain. Moreover, an olive tree produces no fruit for the first six years (but farmers&#x27; difficulty of lasting until payback may also give rise to a mercantilist argument in favour of supporting them through that, since the British case illustrates that &quot;One domestic policy that had a lasting impact was the conversion of &#x27;waste lands&#x27; to agricultural use. Mercantilists felt that to maximize a nation&#x27;s power all land and resources had to be used to their utmost&quot;).

===Moral ===
In his poems, Solon portrays Athens as being under threat from the unrestrained greed and arrogance of its citizens. Even the earth (Gaia), the mighty mother of the gods, had been enslaved. The visible symbol of this perversion of the natural and social order was a boundary marker called a , a wooden or stone pillar indicating that a farmer was in debt or under contractual obligation to someone else, either a noble patron or a creditor.
Up until Solon&#x27;s time, land was the inalienable property of a family or clan and it could not be sold or mortgaged. This was no disadvantage to a clan with large landholdings since it could always rent out farms in a sharecropping system. A family struggling on a small farm however could not use the farm as security for a loan even if it owned the farm. Instead the farmer would have to offer himself and his family as security, providing some form of slave labour in lieu of repayment. Equally, a family might voluntarily pledge part of its farm income or labour to a powerful clan in return for its protection. Farmers subject to these sorts of arrangements were loosely known as indicating that they either paid or kept a sixth of a farm&#x27;s annual yield. In the event of &#x27;bankruptcy&#x27;, or failure to honour the contract stipulated by the , farmers and their families could in fact be sold into slavery.

Solon&#x27;s reform of these injustices was later known and celebrated among Athenians as the (shaking off of burdens). As with all his reforms, there is considerable scholarly debate about its real significance. Many scholars are content to accept the account given by the ancient sources, interpreting it as a cancellation of debts, while others interpret it as the abolition of a type of feudal relationship, and some prefer to explore new possibilities for interpretation. The reforms included:
*annulment of all contracts symbolised by the .
*prohibition on a debtor&#x27;s person being used as security for a loan, i.e., debt slavery.
*release of all Athenians who had been enslaved.

The removal of the clearly provided immediate economic relief for the most oppressed group in Attica, and it also brought an immediate end to the enslavement of Athenians by their countrymen. Some Athenians had already been sold into slavery abroad and some had fled abroad to escape enslavement – Solon proudly records in verse the return of this diaspora. It has been cynically observed, however, that few of these unfortunates were likely to have been recovered. It has been observed also that the not only removed slavery and accumulated debt but may also have removed the ordinary farmer&#x27;s only means of obtaining further credit.

The however was merely one set of reforms within a broader agenda of moral reformation. Other reforms included:
*the abolition of extravagant dowries.
*legislation against abuses within the system of inheritance, specifically with relation to the (i.e. a female who had no brothers to inherit her father&#x27;s property and who was traditionally required to marry her nearest paternal relative in order to produce an heir to her father&#x27;s estate).
*entitlement of any citizen to take legal action on behalf of another.
*the disenfranchisement of any citizen who might refuse to take up arms in times of civil strife, and war, a measure that was intended to counteract dangerous levels of political apathy.

Demosthenes claimed that the city&#x27;s subsequent golden age included &quot;personal modesty and frugality&quot; among the Athenian aristocracy.

=== Sexual ===
As a regulator of Athenian society, Solon, according to some authors, also formalized its sexual mores. According to a surviving fragment from a work (&quot;Brothers&quot;) by the comic playwright Philemon, Solon established publicly funded brothels at Athens in order to &quot;democratize&quot; the availability of sexual pleasure. While the veracity of this comic account is open to doubt, at least one modern author considers it significant that in Classical Athens, three hundred or so years after the death of Solon, there existed a discourse that associated his reforms with an increased availability of heterosexual contacts.

Ancient authors also say that Solon regulated pederastic relationships in Athens; this has been presented as an adaptation of custom to the new structure of the . According to various authors, ancient lawgivers (and therefore Solon by implication) drew up a set of laws that were intended to promote and safeguard the institution of pederasty and to control abuses against freeborn boys. In particular, the orator Aeschines cites laws excluding slaves from wrestling halls and forbidding them to enter pederastic relationships with the sons of citizens. Accounts of Solon&#x27;s laws by 4th century orators like Aeschines, however, are considered unreliable for a number of reasons;

Besides the alleged legislative aspect of Solon&#x27;s involvement with pederasty, there were also suggestions of personal involvement. Ancient readers concluded, based on his own erotic poetry, that Solon himself had a preference for boys. According to some ancient authors Solon had taken the future tyrant Pisistratus as his . Aristotle, writing around 330 BC, attempted to refute that belief, claiming that &quot;those are manifestly talking nonsense who pretend that Solon was the lover of Pisistratus, for their ages do not admit of it&quot;, as Solon was about thirty years older than Pisistratus. Nevertheless, the tradition persisted. Four centuries later Plutarch ignored Aristotle&#x27;s skepticism and recorded the following anecdote, supplemented with his own conjectures:

A century after Plutarch, Aelian also said that Pisistratus had been Solon&#x27;s . Despite its persistence, however, it is not known whether the account is historical or fabricated. It has been suggested that the tradition presenting a peaceful and happy coexistence between Solon and Pisistratus was cultivated during the latter&#x27;s dominion, in order to legitimize his own rule, as well as that of his sons. Whatever its source, later generations lent credence to the narrative. Solon&#x27;s presumed pederastic desire was thought in antiquity to have found expression also in his poetry, which is today represented only in a few surviving fragments. The authenticity of all the poetic fragments attributed to Solon is however uncertain – in particular, pederastic aphorisms ascribed by some ancient sources to Solon have been ascribed by other sources to Theognis instead.

== Poems ==
It is recorded that Solon wrote poetry for pleasure, as patriotic propaganda, and in defence of his constitutional reform. Solon&#x27;s verses have come down to us in fragmentary quotations by ancient authors such as Plutarch and Demosthenes, who used them to illustrate their own arguments. It is possible that some fragments have been wrongly attributed to him and some scholars have detected interpolations by later authors. He was also the first citizen of Athens to reference the goddess Athena (fr. 4.1–4).

The literary merit of Solon&#x27;s verse is generally considered unexceptional. Solon&#x27;s poetry can be said to appear &#x27;self-righteous&#x27; and &#x27;pompous&#x27; at times and he once composed an elegy with moral advice for a more gifted elegiac poet, Mimnermus. Most of the extant verses show him writing in the role of a political activist determined to assert personal authority and leadership. They have been described by the German classicist Wilamowitz as a &quot;versified harangue&quot; (). According to Plutarch, however, Solon originally wrote poetry for amusement, discussing pleasure in a popular rather than philosophical way. Solon&#x27;s elegiac style is said to have been influenced by the example of Tyrtaeus. He also wrote iambic and trochaic verses, which, according to one modern scholar, are livelier and more direct than his elegies and possibly paved the way for the iambics of Athenian drama.

Solon&#x27;s verses are mainly significant for historical rather than aesthetic reasons, as a personal record of his reforms and attitudes. However, poetry is not an ideal genre for communicating facts and very little detailed information can be derived from the surviving fragments. According to Solon the poet, Solon the reformer was a voice for political moderation in Athens at a time when his fellow citizens were increasingly polarized by social and economic differences:
Here translated by the English poet John Dryden, Solon&#x27;s words define a &#x27;moral high ground&#x27; where differences between rich and poor can be reconciled or maybe just ignored. His poetry indicates that he attempted to use his extraordinary legislative powers to establish a peaceful settlement between the country&#x27;s rival factions:
His attempts evidently were misunderstood:

<text>Bacchylides (; &quot;Bakkhulides&quot;; – ) was a Greek lyric poet. Later Greeks included him in the canonical list of Nine Lyric Poets, which included his uncle Simonides. The elegance and polished style of his lyrics have been noted in Bacchylidean scholarship since at least Longinus. Some scholars have characterized these qualities as superficial charm. He has often been compared unfavourably with his contemporary, Pindar, as &quot;a kind of Boccherini to Pindar&#x27;s Haydn&quot;. However, the differences in their styles do not allow for easy comparison, and translator Robert Fagles has written that &quot;to blame Bacchylides for not being Pindar is as childish a judgement as to condemn ... Marvell for missing the grandeur of Milton&quot;. His career coincided with the ascendency of dramatic styles of poetry, as embodied in the works of Aeschylus or Sophocles, and he is in fact considered one of the last poets of major significance within the more ancient tradition of purely lyric poetry. The most notable features of his lyrics are their clarity in expression and simplicity of thought, making them an ideal introduction to the study of Greek lyric poetry in general and to Pindar&#x27;s verse in particular.

==Life==
This precept, from one of Bacchylides&#x27; extant fragments, was considered by his modern editor, Richard Claverhouse Jebb, to be typical of the poet&#x27;s temperament: &quot;If the utterances scattered throughout the poems warrant a conjecture, Bacchylides was of placid temper; amiably tolerant; satisfied with a modest lot; not free from some tinge of that pensive melancholy which was peculiarly Ionian; but with good sense...&quot;

Bacchylides&#x27; lyrics do not seem to have been popular in his own lifetime. Lyrics by his uncle, Simonides, and his rival, Pindar, were known in Athens and were sung at parties, they were parodied by Aristophanes and quoted by Plato, but no trace of Bacchylides&#x27; work can be found until the Hellenistic age, when Callimachus began writing some commentaries on them. Like Simonides and Pindar, however, Bacchylides composed lyrics to appeal to the sophisticated tastes of a social elite and his patrons, though relatively few in number, covered a wide geographical area around the Mediterranean, including for example Delos in the Aegean Sea, Thessaly in the north of the Greek mainland, and Sicily or Magna Graecia in the west. It has been inferred from the elegance and quiet charm of his lyrics that he only gradually acquired fame towards the end of his life.

Being drawn from sources compiled long after his death, the details of Bacchylides&#x27;s life are sketchy and sometimes contradictory. According to Strabo, he was born in Ioulis, on the island of Keos, and his mother was the sister of Simonides. According to Suda, his father&#x27;s name was Meidon and his grandfather, also named Bacchylides, was a famous athlete, yet according to Etymologicum Magnum his father&#x27;s name was Meidylus. There is an ancient tradition, upheld for example by Eustathius and Thomas Magister, that he was younger than Pindar and some modern scholars have endorsed it, such as Jebb, who assigns his birth to around 507 BC, whereas Bowra, for example, opted for a much earlier date, around 524–1 BC. Most modern scholars however treat Bacchylides as an exact contemporary of Pindar, placing his birth around 518 BC. According to one account, Bacchylides was banished for a time from his native Keos and spent this period as an exile in Peloponnesus, where his genius ripened and he did the work which established his fame. Plutarch is the only ancient source for this account and yet it is considered credible on the basis of some literary evidence (Pindar wrote a paean celebrating Keos, in which he says on behalf of the island &quot;I am renowned for my athletic achievements among Greeks&quot; [Paean 4, epode 1], a circumstance that suggests that Bacchylides himself was unavailable at the time.) Observations by Eusebius and Georgius Syncellus can be taken to indicate that Bacchylides might have been still alive at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, but modern scholars have differed widely in estimates of the year of his death – Jebb, for example sets it at 428 BC and yet a date around 451 BC is more favoured.

Keos, where Bacchylides was born and raised, had long had a history of poetical and musical culture, especially in its association with Delos, the focal point of the Cyclades and the principal sanctuary of the Ionian race, where the people of Keos annually sent choirs to celebrate festivals of Apollo. There was a thriving cult of Apollo on Keos too, including a temple at Carthaea, a training ground for choruses where, according to Athenaeus, Bacchylides&#x27;s uncle, Simonides, had been a teacher in his early years. Ceans had a strong sense of their national identity, characterized by their own exotic legends, national folklore and a successful tradition of athletic competition, especially in running and boxing – making the island a congenial home for a boy of quick imagination. Athletic victories achieved by Ceans in panhellenic festivals were recorded at Ioulis on slabs of stone and thus Bacchylides could readily announce, in an ode celebrating one such victory (Ode 2), a total of twenty-seven victories won by his countrymen at the Isthmian Games. Ceans had participated in the defeat of the Persians at the Battle of Salamis and they could take pride in the fact that an elegy composed by Bacchylides&#x27;s uncle was chosen by Athens to commemorate the Athenians who fell at the Battle of Marathon. Being only thirteen miles from the Athenian cape Sunium, Keos was in fact necessarily responsive to Athenian influences.

Bacchylides&#x27;s career as a poet probably benefited from the high reputation of his uncle, Simonides, whose patrons, when Bacchylides was born, already included Hipparchus, brother of Hippias the tyrant of Athens (527–10 BC) and cultural coordinator of the city at that time. Simonides later introduced his nephew to ruling families in Thessaly and to the Sicilian tyrant, Hieron of Syracuse, whose glittering court attracted artists of the calibre of Pindar and Aeschylus. Bacchylides&#x27;s first notable success came sometime after 500 BC with commissions from Athens for the great Delian festival (Ode 17) and from Macedonia for a song to be sung at a symposium for the young prince, Alexander I (fr. 20B). Soon he was competing with Pindar for commissions from the leading families of Aegina and, in 476 BC, their rivalry seems to have reached the highest levels when Bacchylides composed an ode celebrating Hieron&#x27;s first victory at the Olympian Games (Ode 5). Pindar celebrated the same victory but used the occasion to advise the tyrant of the need for moderation in one&#x27;s personal conduct (Pindar&#x27;s Olympian Ode 1), whereas Bacchylides probably offered his own ode as a free sample of his skill in the hope of attracting future commissions. Bacchylides was commissioned by Hieron in 470 BC, this time to celebrate his triumph in the chariot race at the Pythian Games (Ode 4). Pindar also composed a celebratory ode for this victory (Pindar&#x27;s Pythian Ode 1), including however stern, moral advice for the tyrant to rule wisely. Pindar was not commissioned to celebrate Hieron&#x27;s subsequent victory in the chariot race at the Olympic Games in 468 BC – this, the most prestigious of Hieron&#x27;s victories, was however celebrated by Bacchylides (Ode 3). The tyrant&#x27;s apparent preference for Bacchylides over Pindar on this occasion might have been partly due to the Cean poet&#x27;s simpler language and not just to his less moralizing posture, and yet it is also possible that Bacchylides and his uncle were simply better suited to palace politics than was their more high-minded rival. Alexandrian scholars in fact interpreted a number of passages in Pindar as hostile allusions to Bacchylides and Simonides and this interpretation has been endorsed by modern scholars also.

As a composer of choral lyrics, Bacchylides was probably responsible also for the performance, involving him in frequent travel to venues where musicians and choirs awaited instruction. Ancient authorities testify to his visit to the court of Hieron (478–467) and this is indeed indicated by his fifth Ode (476 BC), where the word &quot;xenos&quot; (V.11) implies that he had already been Hieron&#x27;s guest, (probably accompanied by his uncle). Verses 15 and 16 of his third ode (468 BC), also for Hieron, indicate that he might have composed that work at Syracuse.

==Work==
===History===
The poems were collected into critical editions sometime in the late 3rd century BC by the Alexandrian scholar, Aristophanes of Byzantium, who probably restored them to their appropriate metres after finding them written in prose form. They were arranged in nine &#x27;books&#x27;, exemplifying the following genres (Bacchylides in fact composed in a greater variety of genres than any of the other lyric poets who comprise the canonic nine, with the exception of Pindar, who composed in ten):

*&quot;hymnoi&quot; – &quot;&quot;hymns&quot;&quot;
*&quot;paianes&quot; – &quot;paeans&quot;
*&quot;dithyramboi&quot; – &quot;dithyrambs&quot;
*prosodia – &quot;processionals&quot; 
*partheneia – &quot;songs for maidens&quot;
*hyporchemata – &quot;songs for light dances&quot;
*enkomia – &quot;songs of praise&quot;
*epinikia – &quot;victory odes&quot;
*erotica – &quot;songs of love&quot;

The Alexandrian grammarian Didymus (circa 30 BC) wrote commentaries on the work of Bacchylides and the poems appear, from the finding of papyri fragments, to have been popular reading in the first three centuries AD. Their popularity seems to have continued into the 4th century also: Ammianus Marcellinus (xxv. 4) observed that the emperor Julian enjoyed reading Bacchylides, and the largest collection of quotations that survived up until the modern era was assembled by Stobaeus (early 5th century). All that remained of Bacchylides&#x27;s poetry by 1896, however, were sixty-nine fragments, totalling 107 lines. These few remains of his writings were collected by Brunck, Bergk, Bland, Hartung, and Neue. The oldest sources on Bacchylides and his work are scholia on Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Aristophanes, Apollonius Rhodius and Callimachus. Other fragments and &#x27;notices&#x27; are sprinkled through the surviving works of ancient authors, which they used to illustrate various points they were making, as for example:

*Dionysius of Halicarnassus – frag. 11
*Strabo – notice 57
*Plutarch – frag. 29
*Apollonius Dyscolus – frag. 31
*Zenobius – frag.s 5, 24
*Hephaestion – frag.s 12, 13, 15
*Athenaeus – frag.s 13, 16, 17, 18, 22
*Clement of Alexandria – frag.s 19, 20, 21, 32
*Stobaeus – frag.s 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 28
*Priscian – frag. 27
*Johannes Siceliota – frag. 26
*Etymologicum Magnum – frag.s 25, 30
*Palatine Anthology – frag.s 33, 34.

Fortunately for Bacchylidean scholarship, a papyrus came to light in Egypt at the end of the 19th century with a text of Greek uncials, which a local claimed to have found in a ransacked tomb, between the feet of a mummy. It was snapped up for a &quot;preposterous&quot; price by the Egyptologist Wallis Budge, of the British Museum. Budge&#x27;s plan to return to the museum with the papyrus was unacceptable to the British Consul and to the Egyptian Service of Antiquities so he resorted to desperate measures. In an elaborate plan involving a crate of oranges, switched trains and covert embarkations including a midnight rendezvous with a P&amp;O steamship, he eventually sailed from the Suez with the papyrus dismembered and disguised as a packet of photographs. He presented his find in 1896 to Frederic Kenyon in the British Museum&#x27;s Department of Manuscripts. Kenyon reassembled 1382 lines, of which 1070 were perfect or easily restored and, the following year, he published an edition of twenty poems, six of them nearly complete. Some more pieces of the Egyptian fragments were fitted together by Friedrich Blass in Germany and then followed the authoritative edition of Bacchylides&#x27; poetry by Richard Claverhouse Jebb – a combination of scholars that inspired one academic to comment: &quot;we almost had the Renaissance back again&quot;.

As noted by Frederic Kenyon, the papyrus was originally a roll probably about seventeen feet long and about ten inches high, written in the Ptolemaic period, with some Roman characteristics that indicate a transition between styles, somewhere around 50 BC. It reached England in about two hundred torn fragments, the largest about twenty inches in length and containing four and a half columns of writing, the smallest being scraps with barely enough space for one or two letters. The beginning and end sections were missing and the damage done to the roll was not entirely the result of its recent discovery. Kenyon gradually pieced the fragments together, making three independent sections: the first, nine feet long with twenty-two columns of writing; the next section, a little over two feet long with six columns; the third, three and a half feet long with ten columns – a total length of almost fifteen feet and thirty-nine columns, in which form the papyrus remains in the British Library. Friedrich Blass later pieced together some of the still detached fragments and concluded that two of the poems on the restored roll (Odes vi. and vii., as numbered by Kenyon in the &quot;editio princeps&quot;) must be parts of a single ode (for Lachon of Keos) – hence even today the poems can be found numbered differently, with Jebb for example one of those following Blass&#x27;s lead and numbering the poems differently from Kenyon from poem 8 onwards (Kenyon 9 = Jebb 8 and so on).

Bacchylides had become, almost overnight, among the best represented poets of the canonic nine, with about half as many extant verses as Pindar, adding about a hundred new words to Greek lexicons. Ironically, his newly discovered poems sparked a renewed interest in Pindar&#x27;s work, with whom he was compared so unfavourably that &quot;the students of Pindaric poetry almost succeeded in burying Bacchylides all over again.&quot;

===Style===
Much of Bacchylides&#x27;s poetry was commissioned by proud and ambitious aristocrats, a dominant force in Greek political and cultural life in the 6th and early part of the 5th centuries, yet such patrons were gradually losing influence in an increasingly democratic Greek world. The kind of lofty and stately poetry that celebrated the achievements of these archaic aristocrats was within the reach of &#x27;The Cean nightingale&#x27;, yet he seems to have been more at home in verses of a humbler and lighter strain, even venturing on folksiness and humour.

Lyric poetry was still a vigorous art-form and its genres were already fully developed when Bacchylides started out on his career. From the time of the Peloponnesian War, around the end of his life, the art-form was in decline, as exemplified by the inferior dithyrambs of Philoxenos of Cythera. Meanwhile, tragedy, as developed by Athenian dramatists of the calibre of Aeschylus and Sophocles, had begun to emerge as the leading poetic genre, borrowing the literary dialect, the metres and poetic devices of lyric poetry in general and the dithyramb in particular (Aristotle &quot;Poetics&quot; IV 1449a). The debt however was mutual and Bacchylides borrowed from tragedy for some of his effects – thus Ode 16, with its myth of Deianeira, seems to assume audience knowledge of Sophocles&#x27;s play, &quot;Women of Trachis&quot;, and Ode 18 echoes three plays – Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Persians&quot; and &quot;Suppliants&quot; and Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;. His vocabulary shows the influence of Aeschylus with several words being common to both poets and found nowhere else. The use of gripping and exciting narrative and the immediacy gained from the frequent use of direct speech are thought to be among Bacchylides&#x27;s best qualities, influencing later poets such as Horace (who imitated him, according to Pomponius Porphyrion, in &quot;Carmen&quot; I. 15, where Nereus predicts the destruction of Troy). These narrative qualities were modelled largely on the work of Stesichorus, whose lyrical treatment of heroic myth influenced, for instance, Ode 5. Whereas however Stesichorus developed graphic images in his poetry that subsequently became established in vase painting, Bacchylides merely employed images already current in his own day. 
Simonides, the uncle of Bacchylides, was another strong influence on his poetry, as for example in his metrical range, mostly dactylo-epitrite in form, with some Aeolic rhythms and a few iambics. The surviving poems in fact are not metrically difficult, with the exception of two odes (Odes XV and XVI, Jebb). He shared Simonides&#x27;s approach to vocabulary, employing a very mild form of the traditional, literary Doric dialect, with some Aeolic words and some traditional epithets borrowed from epic. Like Simonides, he followed the lyric tradition of coining compound adjectives – a tradition in which the poet was expected to be both innovative and tasteful – but the results are thought by some modern scholars to be uneven. Many of his epithets however serve a thematic and not just a decorative function, as for instance in Ode 3, where the &quot;bronze-walled court&quot; and &quot;well-built halls&quot; of Croesus (Ode 3.30–31 and 3.46) contrast architecturally with the &quot;wooden house&quot; of his funeral pyre (Ode 3.49), in an effect that aims at pathos and which underscores the moral of the ode.

Bacchylides is renowned for his use of picturesque detail, giving life and colour to descriptions with small but skilful touches, often demonstrating a keen sense of beauty or splendour in external nature: a radiance, &quot;as of fire,&quot; streams from the forms of the Nereids (XVI. 103 if. Jebb); an athlete shines out among his fellows like &quot;the bright moon of the mid-month night&quot; among the stars (VIII. 27 if.); the sudden gleam of hope which comes to the Trojans by the withdrawal of Achilles is like a ray of sunshine &quot;from beneath the edge of a storm-cloud&quot; (XII – 105 if.); the shades of the departed, as seen by Heracles on the banks of the Cocytus, resemble countless leaves fluttering in the wind on &quot;the gleaming headlands of Ida&quot; (V. 65 if ). Imagery is employed sparingly but often with impressive and beautiful results, such as in the simile of the eagle in Ode 5 below.

===Ode 5===
Bacchylides has often been compared unflatteringly with Pindar, as for example by the French critic, Henri Weil: &quot;There is no doubt that he fails of the elevation, and also of the depth, of Pindar. The soaring wing was refused him, and he should never have compared himself, as he does somewhere, to an eagle.&quot;

The image of the eagle occurs in Ode 5, which was composed for Hieron of Syracuse in celebration of his Olympic victory with the race-horse Pherenicus in 476 BC. Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Olympian Ode 1&quot; celebrates the same race and the two poems allow for some interesting comparisons. Bacchylides&#x27;s Ode 5 includes, in addition to a brief reference to the victory itself, a long mythical episode on a related theme, and a gnomic or philosophical reflection – elements that occur also in Pindar&#x27;s ode and that seem typical of the victory ode genre. Whereas however Pindar&#x27;s ode focuses on the myth of Pelops and Tantalus and demonstrates a stern moral about the need for moderation in personal conduct (a reflection on Hieron&#x27;s political excesses), Bacchylides&#x27;s ode focuses on the myths of Meleager and Hercules, demonstrating the moral that nobody is fortunate or happy in all things (possibly a reflection on Hieron&#x27;s chronic illness). This difference in moral posturing was typical of the two poets, with Bacchylides adopting a quieter, simpler and less forceful manner than Pindar. Frederic G. Kenyon, who edited the papyrus poems, took an unsympathetic view of Bacchylides&#x27;s treatment of myth in general:

Bacchylides however might be better understood as an heir to Stesichorus, being more concerned with story-telling per se, than as a rival of Pindar. But irrespective of any scruples about his treatment of myth, Bacchylides is thought to demonstrate in Ode 5 some of his finest work and the description of the eagle&#x27;s flight, near the beginning of the poem, has been called by one modern scholar &quot;the most impressive passage in his extant poetry.&quot;

:::::::::...Quickly
::::cutting the depth of air
:::on high with tawny wings
::::the eagle, messenger of Zeus
:::who thunders in wide lordship,
::::is bold, relying on his mighty
:::strength, while other birds
::::cower, shrill-voiced, in fear.
:::The great earth&#x27;s mountain peaks do not hold him back,
::::nor the tireless sea&#x27;s
:::rough-tossing waves, but in
::::the limitless expanse
:::he guides his fine sleek plumage
::::along the West Wind&#x27;s breezes,
::::manifest to men&#x27;s sight.

:::So now for me too countless paths extend in all directions
::::by which to praise your [i.e. Hieron&#x27;s] prowess...(Ode 5.16–33)

Bacchylides&#x27;s image of the poet as an eagle winging across the sea was not original – Pindar had already used it earlier (&quot;Nemean Odes&quot; 5.20–21). In fact, in the same year that both poets celebrated Pherenicus&#x27;s Olympic victory, Pindar also composed an ode for Theron of Acragas (&quot;Olympian&quot; 2), in which he likens himself to an eagle confronted with chattering ravens – possibly a reference to Bacchylides and his uncle. It is possible in that case that Bacchylides&#x27;s image of himself as an eagle in Ode 5 was a retort to Pindar. Moreover, Bacchylides&#x27;s line &quot;So now for me too countless paths extend in all directions&quot; has a close resemblance to lines in one of Pindar&#x27;s Isthmian Odes (1.1–2), &quot;A thousand ways ... open on every side widespread before me&quot; but, as the date of Pindar&#x27;s Isthmian Ode is uncertain, it is not clear in this case who was imitating whom. According to Kenyon, Pindar&#x27;s idiosyncratic genius entitles him to the benefit of a doubt in all such cases: &quot;... if there be actual imitation at all, it is fairly safe to conclude that it is on the part of Bacchylides.&quot; In fact one modern scholar has observed in Bacchylides a general tendency towards imitation, sometimes approaching the level of quotation: in this case, the eagle simile in Ode 5 may be thought to imitate a passage in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (375–83), and the countless leaves fluttering in the wind on &quot;the gleaming headlands of Ida&quot;, mentioned later in the ode, recall a passage in &quot;Iliad&quot; (6.146–9). A tendency to imitate other poets is not peculiar to Bacchylides, however – it was common in ancient poetry, as for example in a poem by Alcaeus (fragment 347), which virtually quotes a passage from Hesiod (&quot;Works and Days&quot; 582–8).

Pindar&#x27;s Olympian Ode 1 and Bacchylides&#x27;s Ode 5 differ also in their description of the race – while Pindar&#x27;s reference to Pherenicus is slight and general (&quot;...speeding / by Alpheus&#x27; bank, / His lovely limbs ungoaded on the course...&quot;: &quot;Olympian&quot; I.20–21), Bacchylides describes the running of the winner more vividly and in rather more detail – a difference that is characteristic of the two poets:

:::When Pherenicos with his auburn mane
::::ran like the wind
:::beside the eddies of broad Alpheios,
::::Eos, with her arms all golden, saw his victory,
:::and so too at most holy Pytho.
::::Calling the earth to witness, I declare
:::that never yet has any horse outstripped him
::::in competition, sprinkling him with dust
:::as he rushed forward to the goal.
::::For like the North Wind&#x27;s blast,
:::keeping the man who steers him safe,
::::he hurtles onward, bringing to Hieron,
:::that generous host, victory with its fresh applause.(Ode 5.37–49)

Ultimately, however, Bacchylides and Pindar share many of the same goals and techniques – the difference is largely one of temperament:

===Ode 13===
Ode 13 of the Bacchylides is a Nemean ode performed to honor the athlete Pytheas of Aegina for winning the pancration event of the Nemean games. Bacchylides begins his ode with the tale of Heracles fighting the Nemean lion, employing the battle to explain why pancration tournaments are now held during the Nemean games. The allusion to Heracles’ fight with the lion is also meant to incite why it is that Pytheas fights for the wreaths of the games: to obtain the undying glory that the heroes of old now possess for their deeds. Bacchylides then sings the praises of Pytheas&#x27; home, the island Aegina, and how &quot;her fame excites a dancer’s praise.&quot; Bacchylides continues this dancer allusion in praise of Aegina, and ends it by listing some famous men who were born on the island, namely Peleus and Telamon. Bacchylides then tells of the greatness of these men’s sons, Achilles and Ajax, alluding to a second myth, the tale of Ajax repelling Hector on the beaches of Troy, keeping the Trojans from burning the Greek ships. Bacchylides relates how Achilles’ inaction spurred the Trojans to false hope, and how their swollen pride led them to be destroyed at the hands of the men they thought they had vanquished. The ode plays upon the fact that those who are listening to Bacchylides have also read the epics of Homer, and understand the whole story behind this scene that would speak poorly of Achilles if people did not know the role he played in the Trojan war. With this tale complete Bacchylides proclaims once again that the actions he has just told will be forever remembered thanks to the muses, leading once again into his praise of Pytheas and his trainer Menander, who shall be remembered for their great victories in the Pan-Hellenic games, even if an envious rival slights them.

===Ode 15===
The Sons of Antenor, or Helen Demanded Back, is the first of Bacchylides’s dithyrambs in the text restored in 1896. The opening is incomplete, as part of the papyrus was damaged. The dithyramb treats a moment in myth before the Trojan war, when Menelaus, Antenor, and Antenor’s sons go to King Priam to demand the return of Helen. As is often the case with ancient Greek literature, Bacchylides plays of the audience’s knowledge of Homer without repeating a scene told by Homer. He instead describes a scene which is new to the audience, but which is given context by knowledge of the Iliad and Odyssey. The story of this embassy was known to Homer, who merely alludes to it at &quot;Iliad&quot; 3.205ff., but it was fully related in the cyclic epic poem &quot;Cypria&quot;, according to the &quot;Chrestomathy&quot; of Proclus.

The style also plays off of Homer. Characters are almost always named with their fathers, i.e. Odysseus, son of Laertes (as reconstructed). They are also given epithets, though these are not the traditional Homeric epithets: godly Antenor, upright Justice, reckless Outrage.

<doc id="58232" wikidata="Q1066612" url="?curid=58232" title="List of federal agencies in the United States">
<text>Legislative definitions of an agency of the federal government of the United States are varied, and even contradictory. The official &quot;United States Government Manual&quot; offers no definition. While the Administrative Procedure Act definition of &quot;agency&quot; applies to most executive branch agencies, Congress may define an agency however it chooses in enabling legislation, and through subsequent litigation often involving the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the Sunshine Act. These further cloud attempts to enumerate a list of agencies.

The executive branch of the federal government includes the Executive Office of the President and the United States federal executive departments (whose secretaries belong to the Cabinet). Employees of the majority of these agencies are considered civil servants.

The majority of the independent agencies of the United States government are also classified as executive agencies (they are independent in that they are not subordinated under a Cabinet position). There are a small number of independent agencies that are not considered part of the executive branch, such as the Congressional Research Service and the United States Sentencing Commission, which are legislative and judicial agencies, respectively. 


==United States Congress==

The U.S. Congress is the bicameral legislature of the United States government, and is made up of two chambers: the United States Senate (the upper chamber) and the United States House of Representatives (the lower chamber). Together, the two chambers exercise authority over the following legislative agencies:
The legislature also oversees the Library of Congress (LOC), a national library dedicated to national records, which administers various programs, agencies, and services including:
* Global Legal Information Network (GLIN)
* Congressional Research Service (CRS)
* United States Copyright Office (USCO) and the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB)
* National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled

==Federal judiciary of the United States==
The federal judiciary consists of courts established under Article Three of the United States Constitution. These are the 

* Supreme Court
* Circuit Courts of Appeals
* District Courts
* Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
* Court of International Trade
* Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
* Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, and 
* Alien Terrorist Removal Court. 

The United States bankruptcy courts, while not established as Article III courts, are legally designated as &quot;units of the district courts.&quot;

The judicial branch includes the following agencies:
* Federal Judicial Center
* Federal Public Defender Organizations
* Judicial Conference of the United States
** Administrative Office of the United States Courts
*** Office of Court Administration
*** Office of Defender Services
*** Office of Facilities and Security
*** Office of Finance and Budget

<text>Baccio d&#x27;Agnolo (19 May 14626 March 1543), born Bartolomeo Baglioni, was an Italian woodcarver, sculptor, and architect from Florence.

== Biography ==
&quot;Baccio&quot; is an abbreviation of Bartolomeo, and &quot;d&#x27;Agnolo&quot; refers to Angelo, his father&#x27;s name. He was the son of a hosier turned woodworker. He started as a wood-carver, and between 1491 and 1502 did much of the decorative carving in the church of Santa Maria Novella and the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. The wooden structure of Santissima Annunziata, an elaborate double-sided altarpiece, was &quot;begun in 1500 on a design by Baccio D&#x27;Agnolo&quot;. Having made his reputation as a sculptor he appears to have turned his attention to architecture, and to have studied at Rome, though the precise date is uncertain; but at the beginning of the sixteenth century he was engaged with the architect Simone del Pollaiolo in restoring the Palazzo Vecchio, and in 1506 he was commissioned to complete the drum of the cupola of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. The latter work, however, was interrupted on account of adverse criticisms from Michelangelo, and it remained unexecuted. 

In 1496 he began a long association with the Palazzo della Signoria for the fabric and decoration works. He gradually assumed a dominant role. In 1499 he became the head of the office of the works, a position he occupied until the end of his life. During this time, he designed many projects including a private apartment for Piero Soderini when he was Gonfalonier.

Baccio d&#x27;Agnolo also designed, among others, the Palazzo Borgherini-Rosselli del Turco and the Palazzo Bartolini Salimbeni. The Bartolini palace was the first house to be given frontispieces of columns to the door and windows, previously confined to churches. This is &quot;the oldest example of the explicit use of window frames in secular architecture&quot;. He was ridiculed by the Florentines for this innovation. Another much-admired work of his was the campanile of the church of Santo Spirito. His studio was the resort of some of the most celebrated artists of the day: Michelangelo, Andrea Sansovino, the brothers Antonio da Sangallo the Elder and Giuliano da Sangallo, and the young Raphael. He died at Florence in 1543, leaving three sons, all architects, the best-known being Giuliano d&#x27;Agnolo.

Giorgio Vasari included Baccio in volume IV of his &quot;Vite&quot;.

<text>The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT or DOT) is one of the executive departments of the U.S. federal government. It is headed by the secretary of transportation, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet.

The department&#x27;s fiscal year 2022–2026 strategic plan states that its mission is &quot;to deliver the world&#x27;s leading transportation system, serving the American people and economy through the safe, efficient, sustainable, and equitable movement of people and goods.&quot;

==History==
In 1965, Najeeb Halaby, the chief of the independent Federal Aviation Agency strongly urged President Lyndon Johnson to set up a cabinet-level Department of Transportation. Halaby proposed merging the responsibilities of the undersecretary of commerce for transportation and the Federal Aviation Agency to achieve this goal. While the federal government was granted authority over aviation and railroads through the commerce clause of the Constitution, the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration primarily provided funding for state and local projects, without significant influence over road construction and operation. Halaby emphasized the need for improved coordination and expressed frustration at the lack of an overall plan. &quot;One looks in vain&quot;, he told Johnson, &quot;for a point of responsibility below the President capable of taking an evenhanded, comprehensive, authoritarian approach to the development of transportation policies or even able to assure reasonable coordination and balance among the various transportation programs of the government.&quot; Johnson convinced Congress to act and The Department of Transportation was authorized in October 1966 and launched on 1 April 1967, with a mission to ensure that federal funds were effectively used to support the national transportation program. Johnson proclaimed upon signing the act: &quot;Transportation has truly emerged as a significant part of our national life. As a basic force in our society, its progress must be accelerated so that the quality of our life can be improved.&quot;

== Budget ==
In 2012, the DOT awarded $742.5 million in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to 11 transit projects. The awardees include light rail projects. Other projects include both a commuter rail extension and a subway project in New York City, and a bus rapid transit system in Springfield, Oregon. The funds subsidize a heavy rail project in northern Virginia, completing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority&#x27;s Metro Silver Line to connect Washington, D.C., and the Washington Dulles International Airport (DOT had previously agreed to subsidize the Silver Line construction to Reston, Virginia).

President Barack Obama&#x27;s budget request for 2010 also included $1.83 billion in funding for major transit projects. More than $600 million went towards ten new or expanding transit projects. The budget provided additional funding for all of the projects currently receiving Recovery Act funding, except for the bus rapid transit project. It also continued funding for another 18 transit projects that are either currently under construction or soon will be. Following the same, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 delegated $600 million for Infrastructure Investments, referred to as Discretionary Grants.

The Department of Transportation was authorized a budget for Fiscal Year 2016 of $75.1 billion. The budget authorization is broken down as follows:
In 2021, President Joe Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The $1.2 trillion act included over $660 billion in funding for transportation-related infrastructure projects over the five-year period of fiscal years 2022–2026.

<text>The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the U.S. federal executive department responsible for public security, roughly comparable to the interior or home ministries of other countries. Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, immigration and customs, cyber security, and disaster prevention and management.

It began operations on March 1, 2003, after being formed as a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, enacted in response to the September 11 attacks. With more than 240,000 employees, DHS is the third-largest Cabinet department, after the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.

==History==
===Creation===
In response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) to coordinate &quot;homeland security&quot; efforts. The office was headed by former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. The official announcement states:

Ridge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001. On November 25, 2002, the Homeland Security Act established the Department of Homeland Security to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to &quot;homeland security&quot; into a single Cabinet agency. The Gilmore Commission, supported by much of Congress and John Bolton, helped to solidify further the need for the department. The DHS incorporated the following 22 agencies.

===List of incorporated agencies===

According to political scientist Peter Andreas, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947 (which had placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency). Creation of DHS constitutes the most diverse merger ever of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization. The founding of the DHS marked a change in American thought towards threats.
Introducing the term &quot;homeland&quot; centers attention on a population that needs to be protected not only against emergencies such as natural disasters but also against diffuse threats from individuals who are non-native to the United States.

Prior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption was focused on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither was included). The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated &quot;riders&quot;, as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives. The plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights. In 2002, Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.

In an August 5, 2002, speech, President Bush said: &quot;We are fighting ... to secure freedom in the homeland.&quot; Prior to the creation of DHS, U.S. Presidents had referred to the U.S. as &quot;the nation&quot; or &quot;the republic&quot; and to its internal policies as &quot;domestic&quot;. Also unprecedented was the use, from 2002, of the phrase &quot;the homeland&quot; by White House spokespeople.
Congress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years since the United States Department of Defense was created.

Tom Ridge was named secretary on January 24, 2003, and began naming his chief deputies. DHS officially began operations on January 24, 2003, but most of the department&#x27;s component agencies were not transferred into the new department until March 1.
After establishing the basic structure of DHS and working to integrate its components, Ridge announced his resignation on November 30, 2004, following the re-election of President Bush. Bush initially nominated former New York City Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik as his successor, but on December 10, Kerik withdrew his nomination, citing personal reasons and saying it &quot;would not be in the best interests&quot; of the country for him to pursue the post.

=== Changes under Secretary Chertoff ===
On January 11, 2005, President Bush nominated federal judge Michael Chertoff to succeed Ridge. Chertoff was confirmed on February 15, 2005, by a vote of 98–0 in the U.S. Senate and was sworn in the same day.

In February 2005, DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the rules would allow DHS &quot;to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department-wide directive&quot; and would make it &quot;difficult, if not impossible, for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing, deployments, technology and other workplace matters&quot;. In August 2005, U.S. District judge Rosemary M. Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective-bargaining rights for DHS employees. A federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006; pending a final resolution to the litigation, Congress&#x27;s fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system.
DHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name &quot;MaxHR&quot;. In a February 2008 court filing, DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules, and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor-management procedures. A federal court issued an order closing the case.

===First Trump administration===
A 2017 memo by Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly directed DHS to disregard &quot;age as a basis for determining when to collect biometrics.&quot;

On November 16, 2018, President Donald Trump signed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 into law, which elevated the mission of the former DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate and established the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. In fiscal year 2018, DHS was allocated a net discretionary budget of $47.716 billion.

===Biden administration ===
In 2021, the Department of Justice began carrying out an investigation into white supremacy and extremism in the DHS ranks.

DHS also halted large-scale immigration raids at job sites, saying in October 2021 that the administration was planning &quot;a new enforcement strategy to more effectively target employers who pay substandard wages and engage in exploitative labor practices.&quot;

In 2023, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol began using an app which requires asylum seekers to submit biometric information before they enter the country.

In June 2024 John Boyd, the head of the DHS Office of Biometric Identity Management, announced at a conference that the agency &quot;is looking into ways it might use facial recognition technology to track the identities of migrant children.&quot; According to Boyd, the initiative is intended to advance the development of facial recognition algorithms. A former DHS official said that every migrant processing center he visited engaged in biometric identity collection, and that children were not separated out during processing. DHS denied collecting the biometric data of children under 14.

==Function==
Whereas the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad, the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within, at, and outside its borders. Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism. On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the U.S. Customs Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations, the primary investigative arm of DHS. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service falls under the Management Directorate.

==Organizational structure==

The Department of Homeland Security is headed by the secretary of homeland security with the assistance of the deputy secretary.

==National Terrorism Advisory System==
In 2011, the Department of Homeland Security phased out the old Homeland Security Advisory System, replacing it with a two-level National Terrorism Advisory System. The system has two types of advisories: alerts and bulletins. NTAS bulletins permit the secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that, while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States, can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly, thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures. Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States. Alerts have two levels: elevated and imminent. An elevated alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target. An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending in the very near term.
On March 12, 2002, the Homeland Security Advisory System, a color-coded terrorism risk advisory scale, was created as the result of a Presidential Directive to provide a &quot;comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal, State, and local authorities and to the American people&quot;. Many procedures at government facilities are tied into the alert level; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level. Since January 2003, it has been administered in coordination with DHS; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration&#x27;s detractors about its ineffectiveness. After resigning, Tom Ridge said he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies.

In January 2003, the office was merged into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council, both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Council, similar in nature to the National Security Council, retains a policy coordination and advisory role and is led by the assistant to the president for homeland security.

==Seal==

The seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The Ad Council – which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign – and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity.
- DHS June 6, 2003

==Headquarters==
Since its inception, the department&#x27;s temporary headquarters had been in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Nebraska Avenue Complex, a former naval facility. The site, across from American University, has 32 buildings comprising of administrative space. In early 2007, the department submitted a $4.1 billion plan to Congress to consolidate its 60-plus Washington-area offices into a single headquarters complex at the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Anacostia, Southeast Washington, D.C.

The move was championed by District of Columbia officials because of the positive economic impact it would have on historically depressed Anacostia. The move was criticized by historic preservationists, who claimed the revitalization plans would destroy dozens of historic buildings on the campus. Community activists criticized the plans because the facility would remain walled off and have little interaction with the surrounding area.

In February 2015 the General Services Administration said that the site would open in 2021. DHS headquarters staff began moving to St. Elizabeths in April 2019 after the completion of the Center Building renovation.

==Disaster preparedness and response==
=== Congressional budgeting effects ===
During a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the reauthorization of DHS, Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke said there is a weariness and anxiety within DHS about the repeated congressional efforts to agree to a long-term spending plan, which had resulted in several threats to shut down the federal government. &quot;Shutdowns are disruptive&quot;, Duke said. She said the &quot;repeated failure on a longtime spending plan resulting in short-term continuing resolutions (CRs) has caused &quot;angst&quot; among the department&#x27;s 240,000 employees in the weeks leading up to the CRs.&quot; The uncertainty about funding hampers DHS&#x27;s ability to pursue major projects and takes away attention and manpower from important priorities. Seventy percent of DHS employees are considered essential and are not furloughed during government shutdowns.

===Ready.gov===
Soon after formation, the department worked with the Ad Council to launch the Ready Campaign, a national public service advertising (PSA) campaign to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. With pro bono creative support from the Martin Agency of Richmond, Virginia, the campaign website &quot;Ready.gov&quot; and materials were conceived in March 2002 and launched in February 2003, just before the launch of the Iraq War. One of the first announcements that garnered widespread public attention to this campaign was one by Tom Ridge in which he stated that in the case of a chemical attack, citizens should use duct tape and plastic sheeting to build a homemade bunker, or &quot;sheltering in place&quot; to protect themselves. As a result, the sales of duct tape skyrocketed, and DHS was criticized for being too alarmist.

On March 1, 2003, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was absorbed into the DHS and in the fall of 2008 took over coordination of the campaign. The Ready Campaign and its Spanish-language version Listo.gov asks individuals to build an emergency supply kit, make a family emergency plan and be informed about the different types of emergencies that can occur and how to respond. The campaign messages have been promoted through television, radio, print, outdoor and web PSAs, as well as brochures, toll-free phone lines and the English and Spanish language websites Ready.gov and Listo.gov.

The general campaign aims to reach all Americans, but targeted resources are also available via &quot;Ready Business&quot; for small- to medium-sized business and &quot;Ready Kids&quot; for parents and teachers of children ages 8–12. In 2015, the campaign also launched a series of PSAs to help the whole community, people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs prepare for emergencies, which included open captioning, a certified deaf interpreter and audio descriptions for viewers who are blind or have low vision.

===National Incident Management System===

On March 1, 2004, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) was created. The stated purpose was to provide a consistent incident management approach for federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5, all federal departments were required to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation program and activities.

===National Response Framework===

In December 2005, the National Response Plan (NRP) was created, in an attempt to align federal coordination structures, capabilities, and resources into a unified, all-discipline, and all-hazards approach to domestic incident management. The NRP was built on the template of the NIMS.

On January 22, 2008, the National Response Framework was published in the Federal Register as an updated replacement of the NRP, effective March 22, 2008.

===Surge Capacity Force===
The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act directs the DHS Secretary to designate employees from throughout the department to staff a Surge Capacity Force (SCF). During a declared disaster, the DHS Secretary will determine if SCF support is necessary. The secretary will then authorize FEMA to task and deploy designated personnel from DHS components and other Federal Executive Agencies to respond to extraordinary disasters.

==Cyber-security==

The DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) is responsible for the response system, risk management program, and requirements for cyber-security in the U.S. The division is home to US-CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate helps government and private end-users transition to new cyber-security capabilities. This directorate also funds the Cyber Security Research and Development Center, which identifies and prioritizes research and development for NCSD. The center works on the Internet&#x27;s routing infrastructure (the SPRI program) and Domain Name System (DNSSEC), identity theft and other online criminal activity (ITTC), Internet traffic and networks research (PREDICT datasets and the DETER testbed), Department of Defense and HSARPA exercises (Livewire and Determined Promise), and wireless security in cooperation with Canada.

On October 30, 2009, DHS opened the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. The center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure.

In January 2017, DHS officially designated state-run election systems as critical infrastructure. The designation made it easier for state and local election officials to get cybersecurity help from the federal government. In October 2017, DHS convened a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) for the Election Infrastructure Subsection with representatives from various state and federal agencies such as the Election Assistance Commission and National Association of Secretaries of State.

==Secretaries==

To date there have been eight confirmed secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security:

* Tom Ridge (January 24, 2003–February 1, 2005)
* Michael Chertoff (February 15, 2005–January 21, 2009)
* Janet Napolitano (January 20, 2009–September 6, 2013)
* Jeh Charles Johnson (December 23, 2013–January 20, 2017)
* John F. Kelly (January 20, 2017–July 28, 2017)
* Kirstjen M. Nielsen (December 6, 2017–April 10, 2019)
* Alejandro Mayorkas (February 1, 2021–January 20, 2025)
* Kristi Noem (January 25, 2025–Now)

==Criticism==
===Excess, waste, and ineffectiveness===
The department has been dogged by persistent criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. Congress estimates that the department has wasted roughly $15 billion in failed contracts (). In 2003, the department came under fire after the media revealed that Laura Callahan, Deputy Chief Information Officer at DHS with responsibilities for sensitive national security databases, had obtained her bachelor, masters, and doctorate computer science degrees through Hamilton University, a diploma mill in a small town in Wyoming. The department was blamed for up to $2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the Government Accountability Office revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees, with purchases including beer brewing kits, $70,000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable, boats purchased at double the retail price (many of which later could not be found), and iPods ostensibly for use in &quot;data storage&quot;.

A 2015 inspection of IT infrastructure found that the department was running over a hundred computer systems whose owners were unknown, including Secret and Top Secret databases, many with out of date security or weak passwords. Basic security reviews were absent, and the department had apparently made deliberate attempts to delay publication of information about the flaws.

===Data mining===
On September 5, 2007, the Associated Press reported that the DHS had scrapped an anti-terrorism data mining tool called ADVISE (Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight and Semantic Enhancement) after the agency&#x27;s internal inspector general found that pilot testing of the system had been performed using data on real people without required privacy safeguards in place. The system, in development at Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 2003, has cost the agency $42 million to date. Controversy over the program is not new; in March 2007, the Government Accountability Office stated that &quot;the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud, crime or terrorism.&quot; Homeland Security&#x27;s Inspector General later said that ADVISE was poorly planned, time-consuming for analysts to use, and lacked adequate justifications.

===Fusion centers===

Fusion centers are terrorism prevention and response centers, many of which were created under a joint project between the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Justice Programs between 2003 and 2007. The fusion centers gather information from government sources as well as their partners in the private sector.

They are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, U.S. military and state and local level government. , DHS recognized at least seventy-two fusion centers. Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster.

There are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others.

David Rittgers of the Cato Institute notes:

a long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security. The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti-abortion activists were worrisome; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists, Tea Party groups, and a Second Amendment rally; the Maryland State Police put anti-death penalty and anti-war activists in a federal terrorism database; a fusion center in Missouri thought that all third-party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat ...
===Mail interception===
In 2006, MSNBC reported that Grant Goodman, &quot;an 81-year-old retired University of Kansas history professor, received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and resealed with a strip of dark green tape bearing the words &quot;by Border Protection&quot; and carrying the official Homeland Security seal.&quot; The letter was sent by a devout Catholic Filipino woman with no history of supporting Islamic terrorism. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection &quot;acknowledged that the agency can, will and does open mail coming to U.S. citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it&#x27;s deemed necessary&quot;:

All mail originating outside the United States Customs territory that is to be delivered inside the U.S. Customs territory is subject to Customs examination,&quot; says the CBP Web site. That includes personal correspondence. &quot;All mail means &#x27;all mail,&#x27;&quot; said John Mohan, a CBP spokesman, emphasizing the point.
The department declined to outline what criteria are used to determine when a piece of personal correspondence should be opened or to say how often or in what volume Customs might be opening mail.

Goodman&#x27;s story provoked outrage in the blogosphere, as well as in the more established media. Reacting to the incident, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; remarked &quot;unlike other prying government agencies, Homeland Security wants you to know it is watching you.&quot; CNN observed &quot;on the heels of the NSA wiretapping controversy, Goodman&#x27;s letter raises more concern over the balance between privacy and security.&quot;

===Employee morale===
In July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS was last or near to last in every category including;
*33rd on the talent management index
*35th on the leadership and knowledge management index
*36th on the job satisfaction index
*36th on the results-oriented performance culture index

The low scores were attributed to concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within the agency. Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization.

DHS is the only large federal agency to score below 50% in overall survey rankings. It was last of large federal agencies in 2014 with 44.0% and fell even lower in 2015 at 43.1%, again last place. DHS continued to rank at the bottom in 2019, prompting congressional inquiries into the problem. High work load resulting from chronic staff shortage, particularly in Customs and Border Protection, has contributed to low morale, as have scandals and intense negative public opinion heightened by immigration policies of the Obama administration.

DHS has struggled to retain women, who complain of overt and subtle misogyny.

===MIAC report===
In 2009, the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) made news for targeting supporters of third party candidates (such as Ron Paul), anti-abortion activists, and conspiracy theorists as potential militia members. Anti-war activists and Islamic lobby groups were targeted in Texas, drawing criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union.

According to DHS:

The Privacy Office has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the fusion center program:
#Justification for fusion centers
#Ambiguous Lines of Authority, Rules, and Oversight
#Participation of the Military and the Private Sector
#Data Mining
#Excessive Secrecy
#Inaccurate or Incomplete Information
#Mission Creep
===Freedom of Information Act processing performance===
In the Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data), the Department of Homeland Security earned a D+ by scoring 69 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade. It also had not updated its policies since the 2007 FOIA amendments.

===Fourteen Words slogan and &quot;88&quot; reference===
In 2018, the DHS was accused of referencing the white nationalist Fourteen Words slogan in an official document, by using a similar fourteen-worded title, in relation to unlawful immigration and border control:

We Must Secure The Border And Build The Wall To Make America Safe Again.

Although dismissed by the DHS as a coincidence, both the use of &quot;88&quot; in a document and the similarity to the slogan&#x27;s phrasing (&quot;We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children&quot;), drew criticism and controversy from several media outlets.

=== Calls for abolition ===
While abolishing the DHS has been proposed since 2011, the idea was popularized when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested abolishing the DHS in light of the abuses against detained migrants by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies.

In 2020, the DHS was criticized for detaining protesters in Portland, Oregon. It even drew rebuke from the department&#x27;s first secretary Tom Ridge who said, &quot;It would be a cold day in hell before I would consent to an uninvited, unilateral intervention into one of my cities&quot;.

On August 10, 2020, in an opinion article for &quot;USA Today&quot; by Anthony D. Romero, the ACLU called for the dismantling of DHS over the deployment of federal forces in July 2020 during the Portland protests.

=== ACLU lawsuit ===
In December 2020, ACLU filed a lawsuit against the DHS, U.S. CBP and U.S. ICE, seeking the release of their records of purchasing cellphone location data. ACLU alleges that this data was used to track U.S. citizens and immigrants and is seeking to discover the full extent of the alleged surveillance.

=== Nejwa Ali controversy ===
The DHS came under fire from pro-Israel politicians in October 2023 for employing Nejwa Ali, who supported Hamas following its deadly terror attack against Israel. Her social media posts were first reported on by the &quot;Daily Wire&quot; and the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; reported on Ali being placed on administrative leave.

<doc id="58237" wikidata="Q76428" url="?curid=58237" title="Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach">
<text>Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (8 March 1714 – 14 December 1788), also formerly spelled Karl Philipp Emmanuel Bach, and commonly abbreviated C. P. E. Bach, was a German Baroque and Classical period composer and musician, the fifth child and second surviving son of Johann Sebastian Bach and Maria Barbara Bach.

C. P. E. Bach was an influential composer working at a time of transition between his father&#x27;s Baroque style and the Classical style that followed it. He was the principal representative of the &quot;&quot; or &#x27;sensitive style&#x27;. The qualities of his keyboard music are forerunners of the expressiveness of Romantic music, in deliberate contrast to the statuesque forms of Baroque music. His organ sonatas mainly come from the galant style.

To distinguish him from his brother Johann Christian, the &quot;London Bach&quot;, who at this time was music master to Queen Charlotte of Great Britain, C. P. E. Bach was known as the &quot;Berlin Bach&quot; during his residence in that city, and later as the &quot;Hamburg Bach&quot; when he succeeded Telemann as Kapellmeister there. To his contemporaries, he was known simply as Emanuel. His second name was in honour of his godfather Georg Philipp Telemann, a friend of Johann Sebastian Bach.

Bach was an influential pedagogue, writing the influential &quot;Essay on the true art of playing keyboard instruments&quot;, which would be studied by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, among others.

==Life==

===Early years: 1714–1738===
C. P. E. Bach was born on 8 March 1714 in Weimar to Johann Sebastian Bach and his first wife, Maria Barbara. He was their fifth child and third son. The composer Georg Philipp Telemann was his godfather. When he was ten years old, he entered the St. Thomas School, Leipzig, where his father had become cantor in 1723. He was one of four Bach children to become professional musicians; all four were trained in music almost entirely by their father. In an age of royal patronage, father and son alike knew that a university education helped prevent a professional musician from being treated as a servant. Carl, like his brothers, pursued advanced studies in jurisprudence at Leipzig University in 1731 and at Frankfurt an der Oder in 1735. In 1738, at the age of 24, he obtained his degree but never practised law, instead turning his attention immediately to music.

===Berlin years: 1738–1768===
A few months after graduation, Bach, with a recommendation by the Graun brothers (Johann Gottlieb and Carl Heinrich) and Sylvius Leopold Weiss, obtained an appointment at Berlin in the service of Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, the future Frederick the Great. Upon Frederick&#x27;s accession in 1740, Bach became a member of the royal orchestra. He was by this time one of the foremost clavier players in Europe, and his compositions, which date from 1731, include about thirty sonatas and concert pieces for harpsichord and clavichord. During his time there, Berlin was a rich artistic environment, where Bach mixed with many accomplished musicians, including several notable former students of his father, and important literary figures, such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, with whom the composer would become close friends.

In Berlin, Bach continued to write numerous pieces for solo keyboard, including a series of character pieces, the so-called &quot;Berlin Portraits&quot;, including &quot;La Caroline&quot;. His reputation was established by the two sets of sonatas which he published with dedications to Frederick the Great (1742) and to Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg (1744). In 1746, he was promoted to the post of chamber musician (&quot;&quot;) and served the king alongside colleagues like Carl Heinrich Graun, Johann Joachim Quantz, and Franz Benda.

The composer who most influenced Bach&#x27;s maturing style was unquestionably his father. He drew creative inspiration from his godfather Georg Philipp Telemann, then working in Hamburg, and from contemporaries like George Frideric Handel, Carl Heinrich Graun, Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart later. Bach&#x27;s interest in all types of art led to influence from poets, playwrights and philosophers such as Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, Moses Mendelssohn and Lessing. Bach&#x27;s work itself influenced the work of, among others, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn.

During his residence in Berlin, Bach composed a Magnificat (1749), in which he shows more traces than usual of his father&#x27;s influence; an Easter cantata (1756); several symphonies and concert works; at least three volumes of songs, including the celebrated &quot;Gellert Songs&quot;; and a few secular cantatas and other occasional pieces. But his main work was concentrated on the clavier, for which he composed, at this time, nearly two hundred sonatas and other solos, including the set &quot;&quot; (&quot;With Varied Reprises&quot;, 1760–1768).

While in Berlin, Bach placed himself in the forefront of European music with a treatise, &quot;&quot; (&quot;An Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments&quot;), immediately recognised as a definitive work on keyboard technique. &quot;Both Haydn and Beethoven swore by it.&quot; By 1780, the book was in its third edition and laid the foundation for the keyboard methods of Clementi and Cramer. The essay lays out the fingering for each chord and some chord sequences. Bach&#x27;s techniques continue to be employed today. The first part of the &quot;Essay&quot; contains a chapter explaining the various embellishments in work of the period, e.g., trills, turns, mordents, etc. The second part presents Bach&#x27;s ideas on the art of figured bass and counterpoint, as well as performance suggestions and a brief section on extemporization, mainly focusing on the Fantasia.

Bach used for his performances instruments (clavichord and fortepiano) made by Gottfried Silbermann, at that time a well-known builder of keyboard instruments. In the recent years one of the models of pianos that Bach was playing, the Gottfried Silbermann 1749, was used as a model for making modern piano copies.

===Hamburg: 1768–1788===
In 1768, after protracted negotiations, Bach was permitted to relinquish his position in order to succeed his godfather Telemann as director of music (&quot;&quot;) at Hamburg. Upon his release from service at the court he was named court composer for Frederick&#x27;s sister, Princess Anna Amalia. The title was honorary, but her patronage and interest in the oratorio genre may have played a role in nurturing the ambitious choral works that followed.

Bach began to turn more of his energy to ecclesiastical and choral music in his new position. The job required the steady production of music for Protestant church services at the Michaeliskirche (Church of St. Michael) and elsewhere in Hamburg. The following year he produced his most ambitious work, the oratorio &quot;Die Israeliten in der Wüste&quot; (&quot;The Israelites in the Desert&quot;), a composition remarkable not only for its &quot;great beauty&quot; but for the resemblance of its plan to that of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot;. Between 1768 and 1788, he wrote twenty-one settings of the Passion, and some seventy cantatas, litanies, motets, and other liturgical pieces. In 1773, Bach wrote an autobiography: he was one of the first composers to write such an account of his life. In Hamburg he also presented a number of works by contemporaries, including his father, Telemann, Graun, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Salieri and Johann David Holland (1746–1827). Bach&#x27;s choral output reached its apex in two works: the double chorus &quot;Heilig&quot; (&quot;Holy&quot;) of 1776, a setting of the seraph song from the throne scene in Isaiah, and the oratorio &quot;Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt Jesu&quot; (&quot;The Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus&quot;) of 1774–1782, which sets a poetic Gospel harmonization by the poet Karl Wilhelm Ramler. Widespread admiration of &quot;Auferstehung&quot; led to three 1788 performances in Vienna sponsored by the Baron Gottfried van Swieten and conducted by Mozart.

Bach married Johanna Maria Dannemann in 1744. Only three of their children lived to adulthood: Johann Adam (1745–89), Anna Carolina Philippina (1747–1804), and Johann Sebastian &quot;the Younger&quot; (1748–78). None became musicians and Johann Sebastian, a promising painter, died at the age of 29 during a 1778 trip to Italy. Emanuel Bach died in Hamburg on 14 December 1788. He was buried in the Michaeliskirche in Hamburg.

==Works==

===In the &quot;Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach&quot;===
Works C. P. E. Bach wrote in the &quot;Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach&quot; are: March in D major, BWV Anh. 122; Polonaise in G minor, BWV Anh. 123; March in G major, BWV Anh. 124; Polonaise in G minor, BWV Anh. 125; and &quot;Solo per il cembalo&quot;, BWV Anh. 129.

===Symphonies===
Among Bach&#x27;s most popular and frequently recorded works are his symphonies. While in Berlin, he wrote several string symphonies (Wq. 173–181), most of which were later revised to add parts for wind instruments. Of these, the E minor symphony, Wq. 178, has been particularly popular.

In Hamburg, Bach wrote a major set of six string symphonies for Gottfried van Swieten, Wq. 182. These works were not published in his lifetime (van Swieten, who had commissioned them to be written in a more &quot;difficult&quot; style, preferred to retain them for private use), but since their rediscovery, have become increasingly popular.

However, Bach&#x27;s best works in the form (by his own estimation) are assuredly the four &quot;Orchester-Sinfonien mit zwölf obligaten Stimmen&quot;, Wq. 183, which, as their title suggests, were written with obbligato wind parts that are integral to the texture, rather than being added on to an older string symphony. The first symphony (D major) in the set has been particularly popular, seeing a continuous performance and publication tradition all the way through the 19th century, which makes it the earliest such symphony. Some of its more unusual features have been taken as characteristic of Bach&#x27;s style: the work, although it is in D major, begins &quot;on&quot; a D major chord, which then turns into a D dominant-seventh chord, outlining &quot;G&quot; major. In fact, there is no cadence on D major (D major is not &quot;confirmed&quot; as the key of the piece) until the beginning of the recapitulation, quite late in the piece.

===Concertos===
Bach was a prolific writer of concertos, especially for keyboard. Like his father, he would often transcribe a concerto for various instruments, leading to problems determining which came first. For instance, the three cello concertos (Wq. 170–172), which are cornerstones of that instrument&#x27;s repertoire, have often been considered to be transcriptions of the harpsichord versions, but recent research has suggested that they might be originally for cello.

According to Bach, his finest keyboard concertos were the &quot;Sei concerti per il cembalo concertato&quot;, Wq. 43, which were written to be somewhat more appealing, and somewhat easier to play. His other concertos were written for oboe, flute, and organ. Bach also wrote for more unusual combinations, including an E-flat major concerto for harpsichord piano. Additionally, he wrote several sonatinas for one or more keyboards and orchestra.

===Chamber music===
Bach&#x27;s chamber music forms something of a bridge between stereotypically Baroque and Classical forms. On the one hand, he wrote trio sonatas and solo sonatas with basso continuo (including ones for harp and viola da gamba); on the other, he wrote several accompanied sonatas for piano, violin, and cello, which are more or less early piano trios, and three very popular quartets for keyboard, flute, and viola. Bach also wrote one of the earliest pieces for solo flute, a sonata that is clearly influenced by his father&#x27;s Partita in A minor for solo flute, BWV 1013.

===Keyboard sonatas===
Bach was a prolific writer of keyboard sonatas, many of which were intended for his favored instrument, the clavichord. During his lifetime, he published more collections of keyboard music than anything else, in the following collections:
* &quot;Sei sonate per cembalo che all&#x27; augusta maestà di Federico II, re di Prussia&quot;, 1742 (&quot;Prussian&quot; sonatas), Wq. 48.
* &quot;Sei sonate per cembalo, dedicate all&#x27; altezza serenissima di Carlo Eugenio, duca di Wirtemberg&quot;, 1744 (&quot;Württemberg&quot; sonatas), Wq. 49.
* &quot;Achtzehn Probe-Stücke in Sechs Sonaten&quot;, 1753 (&quot;Probestücke&quot; sonatas), Wq. 63.
* &quot;Sechs Sonaten fürs Clavier mit veränderten Reprisen&quot;, 1760 (&quot;Reprisen&quot; sonatas), Wq. 50.
* &quot;Fortsetzung von Sechs Sonaten fürs Clavier&quot;, 1761 (&quot;Fortsetzung&quot; sonatas), Wq. 51.
* &quot;Zweite Fortsetzung von Sechs Sonaten fürs Clavier&quot;, 1763 (&quot;Zweite Fortsetzung&quot; sonatas), Wq. 52.
* &quot;Sechs Leichte Clavier Sonaten&quot;, 1766 (&quot;Leichte&quot; sonatas), Wq. 53.
* &quot;Six Sonates pour le Clavecin à l&#x27;usage des Dames&quot;, 1770 (&quot;Damen&quot; sonatas), Wq. 54.
* Six collections of &quot;Clavier Sonaten für Kenner und Liebhaber&quot;, 1779–87 (&quot;Kenner und Liebhaber&quot; sonatas), Wq. 55–59, 61.
Much of Bach&#x27;s energy during his last years was dedicated to the publication of the &quot;Kenner und Liebhaber&quot; collections (which also include fantasias and rondos, see below).

Wq. 64:1–6 are six sonatinas for keyboard, and Wq. 65:1–50 are fifty further keyboard sonatas. The Sonata in E-flat major, Wq. 65:7, is based on &quot;Solo per il cembalo&quot;, , No. 27 in the second Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach.

===Other keyboard works===
Easily Bach&#x27;s best-known piece is the &quot;Solfeggietto&quot;, Wq. 117/2, to the point that the introduction to &quot;The Essential C. P. E. Bach&quot; is subtitled &quot;Beyond the Solfeggio in C Minor&quot;. Several of Bach&#x27;s other miscellaneous keyboard works have gained fame, including the character piece &quot;La Caroline&quot; and the Fantasia in F-sharp minor, Wq. 67. Bach&#x27;s fantasias, in particular, have been considered to show him at his most characteristic: they are full of dramatic silences, harmonic surprises, and perpetually varied figuration.

Bach published three major collections of miscellaneous keyboard works during his lifetime: the &quot;Clavierstücke verschiedener Art&quot;, Wq. 112 of 1765, and the &quot;Kurze und Leichte Clavierstücke&quot; collections, Wq. 113–114 of 1766. The former includes songs, fantasias, dances, sonatas, fugues, and even a symphony and concerto for solo piano (Bach was later to publish an entire collection of keyboard versions of his symphonies).

He also wrote a set of six sonatas for the organ of Frederick the Great&#x27;s sister Anna Amalia.

===Music for mechanical instruments===

Mechanical instruments such as the music box and musical clock were popular at the Prussian court, and C. P. E. Bach wrote thirty original compositions for these instruments, grouped together as Wq. 193. At that time, Bach was court musician to King Frederick the Great at Potsdam; the King, who was intrigued by mechanically reproduced music, had mechanical organ clocks built for the City Castle of Potsdam and for the New Palais.

===Choral works===
Throughout his lifetime, Bach worked on the &quot;Magnificat in D&quot;, Wq. 215. J. S. Bach was alive to hear it in 1749, and C. P. E. continued to revise and perform it as late as 1786. The work clearly shows the influence of J.S. Bach&#x27;s own Magnificat, including the striking resemblance of the &quot;Deposuit&quot; movements in both works.

His other important choral works include the &quot;Heilig&quot; (German Sanctus), Wq. 217, which he performed together with the &quot;Credo&quot; from his Father&#x27;s Mass in B minor, the oratorios &quot;Die Israeliten in der Wüste&quot;, Wq. 238 and &quot;Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt Jesu&quot;, Wq. 240, and 21 Passions.

==Unpublished works==
Many of C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s compositions and original manuscripts were stored in the archive of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin where Bach lived from 1738 to 1768. This archive was packed during the Second World War and hidden to preserve it from Allied bombing, captured and sequestered by USSR forces in 1945, thus long believed lost or destroyed during the war.

The archive was discovered in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 1999, returned to Berlin in 2001, and deposited in the Berlin State Library. It contained 5,100 musical compositions, none ever printed for the public, including 500 by 12 different members of the Bach family.

==Legacy and musical style==
Through the later half of the 18th century, the reputation of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach stood very high, surpassing that of his father. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven admired him and &quot;avidly&quot; collected his music. Mozart said of him, &quot;Bach is the father, we are the children.&quot;

His work has been described as &quot;sincere in thought&quot; and &quot;polished and felicitous in phrase&quot;. His keyboard sonatas, for example, &quot;mark an important epoch in the history of musical form&quot;. &quot;Lucid in style, delicate and tender in expression, they are even more notable for the freedom and variety of their structural design&quot;; they break away altogether from the hardened conventions of the Italian school.

He was probably the first composer of eminence who made free use of harmonic color for its own sake. In this way, he compares well with the most important representatives of the First Viennese School. In fact, he exerted enormous influence on the North German School of composers, in particular Georg Anton Benda, Bernhard Joachim Hagen, Ernst Wilhelm Wolf, Johann Gottfried Müthel, and Friedrich Wilhelm Rust. His influence was not limited to his contemporaries and extended to Felix Mendelssohn and Carl Maria von Weber.

His name fell into neglect during the 19th century, with Robert Schumann notoriously opining that &quot;as a creative musician he remained very far behind his father&quot;; others opined that he was &quot;a somewhat feeble imitator of his father&#x27;s style&quot;. All the same, Johannes Brahms held him in high regard and edited some of his music. By the early 20th century, he was better regarded but the revival of C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s works has been chiefly underway since Helmuth Koch&#x27;s recordings of his symphonies and Hugo Ruf&#x27;s recordings of his keyboard sonatas in the 1960s. There is an ongoing project to record his complete works, led by on the Swedish record label BIS. In 2014, the Croatian pianist Ana-Marija Markovina, in cooperation with the Packard Humanities Institute, the Bach-Archiv Leipzig, the Sächsische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig and Harvard University released a 26-CD box set of the complete works for solo piano on the German record label Hänssler Classic, performed on a modern Bösendorfer grand piano.

The works of C. P. E. Bach are known by &quot;Wq&quot; numbers, from Alfred Wotquenne&#x27;s 1906 catalogue, and by &quot;H&quot; numbers from a catalogue by Eugene Helm (1989).

He was portrayed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner in the 1941 biopic of his brother &quot;Friedemann Bach&quot;.

The street Carl-Philipp-Emanuel-Bach-Straße in Frankfurt (Oder) is named after him.

In 2015 the Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Museum was opened in Hamburg.

2014 marked the 300th anniversary of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach&#x27;s birth. All six German Bach cities—Hamburg, Potsdam, Berlin, Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, Leipzig, and Weimar—hosted concerts and other events to commemorate the anniversary.

<text>Rabbi Yair Chayim Bacharach (1638, Lipník nad Bečvou, Moravia — 1702; Hebrew: יאיר חיים בכרך, also known by his work Chavos Yair or Chavot Yair) was a German rabbi and major 17th century posek, who lived first in Koblenz and then the remainder of his life in Worms and Mainz. His grandmother Eva Bacharach was a granddaughter of the Maharal of Prague, and his father Moses Samson Bacharach, and grandfather had served as rabbis of Worms.

== Life ==

He was born in Lipnik in 1638; according to another claim, he was born in Mahersbrod in 1628. His birth name was Hayim; the name Yair was added after an illness. At age 12 he moved to Worms along with his father, who was appointed rabbi of the city. After the second marriage of his father to Phega, Bacharach become step brother of the famous jewish physician Tobias Cohn. At 22 he was ordained as a rabbi, and served for some time as rabbi of Mainz. In 1666 he was chosen as rabbi of nearby Koblenz, but in 1669 he returned to Worms. His father died in 1670 and although he left a will for the community to elect his son to replace him as chif rabbi they decided not to choose Bacharach but chose Aaron Teomim, a preacher from Prague.

In 1689 the Worms community was decimated by the French during the Nine Years&#x27; War, and Bacharach was forced to leave the city for a period of 10 years. Gradually, it was rebuilt. In 1699 he was appointed rabbi of Worms, where his father and grandfather had served before him. He served for only three years until his death in 1702. The inscription on his tombstone begins with the words: “A great and dark horror befalls us from the hiding of the light of Rabbeinu...”

== Works ==
Bacharach was the author of &quot;Chavos Yair&quot; (&quot;Villages of Yair&quot;) a collection of responsa by the title of which is he commonly referred (first published in Frankfurt am Main, 1699); its title is a reference to his grandmother Chava as well as to a place mentioned in Numbers 32:41 and elsewhere in the Jewish Bible. Other work includes his &quot;Mekor Chayim&quot;, which was intended as a principal commentary to &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot; but was withdrawn by Bacharach when he discovered that other commentaries, notably the Taz and the Magen Avraham, had appeared. It is still regarded as a prime source of material concerning &quot;minhagim&quot; (customs) of the area and epoch. Bacharach also wrote a work criticizing Rabbi Aharon Teomim-Frankels&#x27; &quot;Mateh Aharon&quot;. Therein, Bacharach sharply criticizes the pilpulic methodology common among the rabbis of his time. 

Besides his Halakhic expertise he had complete mastery of all the sciences, music, history and wrote poetry. He compiled a 46 volume encyclopedia on many topics called &quot;Yair Nesiv&quot;, which remains unpublished.

In 1982 his major work, &quot;Mekor Chaim&quot;, was finally published posthumously by Machon Yerushalayim, and was reprinted in 2018.

In 1993, Machon Yerushalayim published the book &quot;Mar Kashisha&quot; from the manuscript pf Bacharach. This work contains a collection of the principles and expressions found in the Talmud and Aggadah.

== Notable Views ==
Bacharachs&#x27; view of Kabbalah was nuanced. While he believed Kabbalah to be very holy, he maintained that it posed great theological danger, and should therefore only be studied by the extremely pious, and only with a teacher. In his responsa, Bacharach relates that a commoner asked him to explain the Kabbalistic formulas commonly printed in prayer books. Bacharach refused to answer, and when he was pressed, said only that he didn&#x27;t know the explanation. Although he discouraged in-depth study of Kabbalah, he encouraged simple reading of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, and many of his writings contain Kabbalistic references, especially to explain communal customs.

<text>Bacharach (, also known as &quot;Bacharach am Rhein&quot;) is a town in the Mainz-Bingen district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Rhein-Nahe, whose seat is in Bingen am Rhein, although that town is not within its bounds.

The original name &quot;Baccaracus&quot; suggests a Celtic origin. Above the town stands Stahleck Castle (&quot;Burg Stahleck&quot;), now a youth hostel.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town lies in the Rhine Gorge, 48 km south of Koblenz.

=== Constituent communities ===
Bacharach is divided into several &quot;Ortsteile&quot;. The outlying centre of Steeg lies in the Steeg Valley (&quot;Steeger Tal&quot;) off to the side, away from the Rhine. This glen lies between Medenscheid and Neurath to the south and Henschhausen to the north on the heights.

== History ==
In the early 11th century, Bacharach had its first documentary mention. It may have been that as early as the 7th century, the kingly domain passed into Archbishop of Cologne Kunibert’s ownership; pointing to this is a &quot;Kunibertskapelle&quot; (chapel) on the spot where now stands the &quot;Wernerkapelle&quot;. The &quot;Vögte&quot; of the Cologne estate were the Elector of the Palatinate, who over time pushed back Cologne’s influence. Count Palatine already had so much influence that he resided at Stahleck Castle. His successor Konrad von Staufen’s daughter secretly wed at Stahleck Castle a son of the Welfs, who were family foes, leading to Bacharach’s, and indeed the whole County Palatine’s, falling for a short time to Henry of Brunswick. In 1214 the Wittelsbachs became Bacharach’s new lords. Together with the &quot;Unteramt&quot; of Kaub they received here their most important toll and revenue source. In 1314 it was decided to choose Louis the Bavarian as the German king. Furthermore, Bacharach was the most important transfer point for the wine trade, as barrels were offloaded here from the smaller ships that were needed to get by the &quot;Binger Loch&quot; (a quartzite reef in the Rhine upstream near Bingen) and loaded onto bigger ones. From then on, the wine bore the designation &quot;Bacharacher&quot;. The timber trade from the Hunsrück also brought Bacharach importance, and in 1356, Bacharach was granted town rights.

Widely visible is the &quot;Wernerkapelle&quot;, a &quot;Rheinromantik&quot; landmark of the town, lying on the way up to Stahleck Castle from the town. It is the expanded &quot;Kunibertkapelle&quot;, and is still an unfinished Gothic ruin today. Its namesake is Werner of Oberwesel, known in connection with pogroms triggered by his death. According to the Christian blood libel, which was typical of the times, a 16-year-old Werner was murdered on Maundy Thursday 1287 by members of the local Jewish community, who then used his blood for Passover observances. On the grounds of this alleged ritual murder, there arose an anti-Semitic mob who waged a pogrom, wiping out Jewish communities in the Middle and Lower Rhine and Moselle regions. In folk Christianity arose the cult of Werner, which was only stricken from the Bishopric of Trier calendar in 1963.

In 1344, building work began on the town wall, and was already finished about 1400. In 1545, the town, along with the Palatinate, became Protestant under Count Palatine Friedrich II. Stahleck Castle and the town wall could not stop Bacharach from undergoing eight changes in military occupation in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, nor the war’s attendant sackings. Moreover, further destruction was wrought by several town fires. Then, in 1689, French troops fighting in the Nine Years&#x27; War blew Stahleck Castle and four of the town wall’s towers up.

In 1794, French Revolutionary troops occupied the Rhine’s left bank and in 1802, Bacharach became temporarily French. During the War of the Sixth Coalition the Prussian Field Marshal Blücher, after crossing the Rhine near Kaub, came through Bacharach and the Steeg Valley on New Year’s Night 1813-1814 with his troops on the way to France. Recalling this event is a monument stone somewhat downstream, across from Kaub. After the Congress of Vienna, the town went, along with the Rhine’s left bank, up to and including Bingerbrück, to Prussia. After the harbour silted up, Bacharach fell into a slumber from which it only awoke in the course of the &quot;Rheinromantik&quot;. Among the first of the prominent visitors at this time was the French writer Victor Hugo.

Caring for and maintaining Bacharach’s building monuments, spurred on in the early 20th century by the Rhenish Association for Monument Care and Landscape Preservation (&quot;Rheinischer Verein für Denkmalpflege und Landschaftsschutz&quot;) which took on the then highly endangered town wall and Stahleck Castle ruin jobs, and the great dedication of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to the &quot;Wernerkapelle&quot; have seen to it that Bacharach is still a jewel of the &quot;Rheinromantik&quot; and a multifaceted documentary site of mediaeval architecture on the Middle Rhine. The &quot;Wernerkapelle&quot; ruin is under monumental protection and before it a plaque has been placed recalling the inhuman crimes against Jewish residents and also containing a quotation from a prayer by Pope John XXIII for a change in Christians’ thinking in their relationship with the Jews:

“We recognize today that many centuries of blindness have shrouded our eyes, so that we no longer saw the goodliness of Thy Chosen People and no longer recognized our firstborn brother’s traits. We discover now that a mark of Cain stands on our forehead. In the course of the centuries our brother Abel has lain in blood that we spilt, and he has wept tears that we brought forth, because we forgot Thy love. Forgive us the curse that we unrightfully affixed to the Jews’ name. Forgive us for nailing Thee in their flesh for a second time to the Cross. For we knew not what we did...&quot;

Today Bacharach thrives on tourism and wine from Bacharach is still enjoying international popularity. Not to be overlooked, however, are problems arising from a shrinking population, itself brought about by a lack of prospects.

=== Amalgamations ===
On 7 June 1969, the formerly self-administering municipality of Steeg was amalgamated with Bacharach.

=== Town partnerships ===
* Overijse, Flemish Brabant, Belgium
* Santenay, Côte-d&#x27;Or, France

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s arms might be described thus: Per fess at the nombril point sable a lion rampant Or armed, langued and crowned gules, and bendy lozengy argent and azure.

==Population development==
The number 1871-1987 are census results

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===
Bacharach lies on the Rhine’s left bank and can be reached by &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 9 or the Rhine. Running regularly to and from Bacharach are the excursion ships of the &quot;Köln-Düsseldorfer-Rheinschiffahrt&quot;, or KD for short.

Transport routes on the other side of the river can be reached by ferry from the &quot;Engelsburg&quot; (castle) over to Kaub.

The town belongs to the &quot;Rhein-Nahe-Nahverkehrsverbund&quot; – a local transport association. Bacharach lies on the West Rhine Railway and is served by Cologne - Koblenz—Boppard—Bacharach—Bingen am Rhein—Mainz Regionalbahn trains (as of August 2022).

<text>Louis Petit de Bachaumont () (June 2, 1690 – April 29, 1771) was a French writer, whose historical interest has been connected largely to his alleged role in the gossipy &quot;Mémoires secrets pour servir à l&#x27;histoire de la République des Lettres&quot;. A modern biography brought to general attention his other roles, as an arbiter of taste, an influential art critic and an &quot;urbaniste&quot;.

Petit de Bachaumont was of noble family and was brought up at the court of Versailles. He passed his whole life in Paris, however, as the centre of the salon of Marie Anne Doublet (1677–1771), where criticism of art and literature took the form of malicious gossip. A sort of register of news was kept in a journal of the salon, starting in 1762, which dealt largely in scandals and contained accounts of books suppressed by the censor. Bachaumont&#x27;s name is commonly connected with the first volumes of this register, which was published anonymously, long after Petit de Bachaumont&#x27;s death, under the title &quot;Mémoires secrets pour servir à l&#x27;histoire de la République des Lettres&quot;, but his exact share in the authorship of those years before his death in 1771 is a matter of controversy. The register was continued by Pidansat de Mairobert (1707–1779), who may have had a greater hand in it from the start, and by others, until it reached 36 volumes (covering the years 1774-1779). It is of some value as a historical source, especially for prohibited literature, and full of anecdotes, for which it was sieved by the brothers Goncourt, who revived interest in this obscure figure, whom they presented as the &quot;anecdotier parfait&quot;, the reputation, as the &quot;perfect recounter of anecdote&quot; to the present time.

Petit de Bachaumont&#x27;s studied &quot;indolence&quot;, remarked upon in his obituary, was a stylish pose. His major published writings are &quot;Essai sur la peinture, la sculpture et l&#x27;architecture&quot; (1751) and his surveys of the Paris salons of 1767 and 1769, in which aesthetics and cultural politics were inseparably entwined. Less noted is his published call in 1749 for the roofing-over of the classical colonnaded east front of the Palais du Louvre and the clearing away of the ramshackle structures, both those that had been built against it, in order to form a proper Palais du Louvre, and those in the centre of the Cour Carrée itself Sections of the palace were in danger of collapse, scarcely touched by royal indifference after 1678; work did begin in 1755 to clear the facade of the Louvre, overseen by the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot and Marigny, supervisor of the Bâtiments du Roi.

As a critic of art, his recommendation of a young artist named François Boucher appeared in a design memorandum Bachaumont presented the duc de Bouillon, who was occupied with renovating interiors at the Château de Navarre in Normandy, in 1730: &quot;he is very quick, works fast and is not expensive&quot;. 
See, in addition to the memoirs of the time, especially the &quot;&quot; of Grimm, Diderot, d&#x27;Alembert and others (new ed-, Paris, 1878); Ch. Aubertin, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit public au XVIIIe siècle&quot; (Paris, 1872).

<doc id="58244" wikidata="Q905964" url="?curid=58244" title="Cordite">
<text>Cordite is a family of smokeless propellants developed and produced in Britain since 1889 to replace black powder as a military firearm propellant. Like modern gunpowder, cordite is classified as a low explosive because of its slow burning rates and consequently low brisance. These produce a subsonic deflagration wave rather than the supersonic detonation wave produced by brisants, or high explosives. The hot gases produced by burning gunpowder or cordite generate sufficient pressure to propel a bullet or shell to its target, but not so quickly as to routinely destroy the barrel of the gun.

Cordite was used initially in the .303 British, Mark I and II, standard rifle cartridge between 1891 and 1915. Shortages of cordite in World War I led to the creation of the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Porridge&quot; munitions factory (HM Factory, Gretna) on the English–Scottish border, which produced around 800 tonnes of cordite per week. The UK also imported some United States–developed smokeless powders for use in rifle cartridges. Cordite was also used for large weapons, such as tank guns, artillery, and naval guns. It has been used mainly for this purpose since the late 19th century by the UK and British Commonwealth countries. Its use was further developed before World War II, and as Unrotated Projectiles for launching anti-aircraft weapons. Small cordite rocket charges were also developed for ejector seats made by the Martin-Baker Company. Cordite was also used in the detonation system of the Little Boy atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima in August 1945.

The term &quot;cordite&quot; generally disappeared from official publications between the wars. During World War II, double-base propellants were very widely used, and there was some use of triple-base propellants by artillery. Triple-base propellants were used in post-war ammunition designs and remain in production for UK weapons; most double-base propellants left service as World War II stocks were expended after the war. For small arms it has been replaced by other propellants, such as the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of extruded powder or the WC844 ball propellant currently in use in the 5.56×45mm NATO. Production ceased in the United Kingdom around the end of the 20th century, with the closure of the last of the World War II cordite factories, ROF Bishopton. Triple-base propellant for UK service (for example, the 105 mm L118 Light Gun) is now manufactured in Germany.

== Adoption of smokeless powder by the British government ==

=== Replacements for gunpowder (black powder)===
Gunpowder, an explosive mixture of sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate (also known as saltpeter), was the original propellant employed in firearms and fireworks. It was used from about the 10th or 11th century onward, but it had disadvantages, including the large amount of smoke it produced. With the 19th-century development of various &quot;nitro explosives&quot;, based on the reaction of nitric acid mixtures on materials such as cellulose and glycerin, a search began for a replacement for gunpowder.

=== Early European smokeless powders ===
The first smokeless powder was developed in 1865 by Johann Edward Schultze. At the time of this breakthrough, Schultze was a captain of Prussian artillery. Schultze eventually rose to the rank of colonel. His formulation (dubbed &quot;Schultze Powder&quot;) was composed of nitrolignose derived from nitrated wood grains, impregnated with saltpetre or barium nitrate.

In 1882, the Explosive Company of Stowmarket introduced &quot;EC Powder&quot;, which contained nitro-cotton and nitrates of potassium and barium in a grain gelatinised by ether alcohol. It had coarser grains than other nitrocellulose powders. It proved unsuitable for rifles, but it remained in long use for shotguns and was later used for grenades and fragmentation bombs.

In 1884, the French chemist Paul Vieille produced a smokeless propellant that had some success. It was made out of collodion (nitrocellulose dissolved in ethanol and ether), resulting in a plastic colloidal substance which was rolled into very thin sheets, then dried and cut up into small flakes. It was immediately adopted by the French military for their Mle 1886 infantry rifle and called &quot;Poudre B&quot; (for &quot;poudre blanche&quot;, or &quot;white powder&quot;) to distinguish it from &quot;black powder&quot; (gunpowder). The rifle and the cartridge developed to use this powder were known generically as the 8mm Lebel, after the officer who developed its 8 mm full metal jacket bullet.

The following year, 1887, Alfred Nobel invented and patented a smokeless propellant he called &quot;Ballistite&quot;. It was composed of 10% camphor, 45% nitroglycerine and 45% collodion (nitrocellulose). Over time the camphor tended to evaporate, leaving an unstable explosive.

=== Development ===

A United Kingdom government committee, known as the &quot;Explosives Committee&quot;, chaired by Sir Frederick Abel, monitored foreign developments in explosives and obtained samples of Poudre B and Ballistite; neither of these smokeless powders was recommended for adoption by the Explosives Committee.

Abel, Sir James Dewar and W Kellner, who was also on the committee, developed and jointly patented (Nos 5,614 and 11,664 in the names of Abel and Dewar) in 1889 a new ballistite-like propellant in 1889. It consists of (by weight) 58% nitroglycerin, 37% guncotton (nitrocellulose) and 5% petroleum jelly. Using acetone as a solvent, it was extruded as spaghetti-like rods initially called &quot;cord powder&quot; or &quot;the Committee&#x27;s modification of Ballistite&quot;, but this was swiftly abbreviated to &quot;Cordite&quot;.

Cordite began as a &quot;double-base&quot; propellant. In the 1930s, &quot;triple-base&quot; was developed by including a substantial proportion of nitroguanidine. Triple-base propellant reduced the disadvantages of double-base propellant – its relatively high temperature and significant flash. Imperial Chemical Industries&#x27;s (ICI) World War II double-base &quot;AN&quot; formulation also had a much lower temperature, but it lacked the flash reduction properties of N and NQ triple-base propellants.

Whilst cordite is classified as an explosive, it is not employed as a high explosive. It is designed to deflagrate, or burn, to produce high pressure gases.

=== Nobel and Abel patent dispute ===

Alfred Nobel sued Abel and Dewar over an alleged patent infringement. His patent specified that the nitrocellulose should be &quot;of the well-known soluble kind&quot;. After losing the case, it went to the Court of Appeal. This dispute eventually reached the House of Lords, in 1895, but it was finally lost because the words &quot;of the well-known soluble kind&quot; in his patent were taken to mean the soluble collodion, and hence specifically excluded the insoluble guncotton. The ambiguous phrase was &quot;soluble nitro-cellulose&quot;: soluble nitro-cellulose was known as &quot;Collodion&quot; and was soluble in alcohol. It was employed mainly for medical and photographic use. In contrast, insoluble in alcohol, nitrocellulose was known as &quot;gun cotton&quot; and was used as an explosive. Nobel&#x27;s patent refers to the production of Celluloid using camphor and soluble nitrocellulose; and this was taken to imply that Nobel was specifically distinguishing between the use of soluble and insoluble nitrocellulose. For a forensic analysis of the case, see The History of Explosives Vol II; The Case for Cordite, John Williams (2014). However, in her comprehensive 2019 biography of Alfred Nobel Ingrid Carlberg notes how closely Abel and Dewar were allowed to follow Nobel&#x27;s work in Paris, and how disappointed Nobel was with how this trust was betrayed. The book argues for Nobel as the original inventor and that the case was lost because of an unimportant technicality.

== Formulations ==
It was quickly discovered that the rate of burning could be varied by altering the surface area of the cordite. Narrow rods were used in small-arms and were relatively fast burning, while thicker rods would burn more slowly and were used for longer barrels, such as those used in artillery and naval guns.

=== Cordite (Mk I) and Cordite MD ===
The original Abel-Dewar formulation was soon superseded, as it caused excessive gun barrel erosion. It has since become known as &quot;Cordite Mk I&quot;.

The composition of cordite was changed to 65% guncotton, 30% nitroglycerin (keeping 5% petroleum jelly), and 0.8% acetone shortly after the end of the Second Boer War. This was known as &quot;Cordite MD&quot; (modified).

Cordite MD cartridges typically weighed approximately 15% more than the cordite Mk I cartridges they replaced, to achieve the same muzzle velocity, due to the inherently less powerful nature of Cordite MD.

=== Cordite RDB ===
During World War I, acetone was in short supply in Great Britain, and a new experimental form was developed for use by the Royal Navy. This was &quot;Cordite RDB&quot; (= &quot;R&quot;esearch &quot;D&quot;epartment formula &quot;B&quot;); which was 52% collodion, 42% nitroglycerin and 6% petroleum jelly. It was produced at HM Factory, Gretna; and the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath.

Acetone for the cordite industry during late World War I was eventually produced through the efforts of Dr. Chaim Weizmann, considered to be the father of industrial fermentation. While a lecturer at Manchester University Weizmann discovered how to use bacterial fermentation to produce large quantities of many desired substances. He used the bacterium &quot;Clostridium acetobutylicum&quot; (the so-called Weizmann organism) to produce acetone. Weizmann transferred the rights to the manufacture of acetone to the Commercial Solvents Corporation in exchange for royalties. After the Shell Crisis of 1915 during World War I, he was director of the British Admiralty Laboratories from 1916 until 1919.

Cordite RDB was later found to become unstable if stored too long.

=== Cordite SC ===
Research on solvent-free Cordite RDB technologically extremely similar to ballistite continued primarily on the addition of stabilizers, which was based on German RP C/12 propellant featuring significant amounts of centralite (Called &quot;carbamite&quot; in British parlance) and led to the type commonly used in World War II as the main naval propellant. In Great Britain this was known as &quot;Cordite SC&quot; (= Solventless Cordite), and it required production facilities separate from classical cordite.

Cordite SC was produced in different shapes and sizes, so the particular geometry of Cordite SC was indicated by the use of letters or numbers, or both, after the SC. For example, SC followed by a number was rod-shaped cord, with the number representing the diameter in thousandths of an inch. &quot;SC T&quot; followed by two sets of numbers indicated tubular propellant, with the numbers representing the two diameters in thousandths.

Two-inch (approximately 50 mm) and three-inch (approximately 75 mm) diameter, rocket Cordite SC charges were developed in great secrecy before World War II for anti-aircraft purposes—the so-called &quot;Z batteries&quot;, using &#x27;Unrotated Projectiles&#x27;.

Great Britain changed to metric units in the 1960s, so there was a discontinuity in the propellant geometry numbering system.

=== Cordite N ===
An important development during World War II was the addition of another explosive, nitroguanidine, to the mixture to form &quot;triple-base&quot; propellant or &quot;Cordite N&quot; and &quot;NQ&quot;. The formulations were slightly different for artillery and naval use. This solved two problems associated with the large naval guns fitted to British Navy&#x27;s capital ships: gun flash and muzzle erosion. Nitroguanidine produces large amounts of nitrogen when heated, which had the benefit of reducing the muzzle flash, and its lower burning temperature greatly reduced the erosion of the gun barrel.

N and NQ were also issued in limited amounts to ammunitions used by the British 25-pdr and 5.5-inch land-based artillery pieces.

After World War II production of double-base propellants generally ended. Triple-base propellants, N and NQ, were the only ones used in new ammunition designs, such as the cartridges for 105 mm Field and for 155 mm FH70.

==Charge design==
== Manufacture ==

=== UK Government factories ===
In Great Britain, cordite was developed for military use at the Royal Arsenal by Abel, Dewar and Kellner, Woolwich, and produced at the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills from 1889 onwards.

At the start of World War I, cordite was in production at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills and by seven other suppliers (British Explosives Syndicate Ltd, Chilworth Gunpowder Company Ltd, Cotton Powder Company Ltd, Messrs Curtis&#x27;s and Harvey Ltd, National Explosives Company Ltd, New Explosives Company Ltd and Nobels Explosive Company Ltd). Existing factories were expanded and new ones built, notably by Nobel&#x27;s at Ardeer, HM Factory, Gretna, which straddled the Scotland-England border at Gretna, and the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath. A factory was also established by the Indian Government at Nilgris. Both the Gretna and the Holton Heath cordite factories closed at the end of World War I.

By the start of World War II, Holton Heath had reopened, and an additional factory for the Royal Navy, The Royal Navy Propellant Factory, Caerwent, opened at Caerwent in Wales. A very large Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Bishopton, was opened in Scotland to manufacture cordite for the British Army and the Royal Air Force. A new cordite factory at Waltham Abbey and two additional ROF&#x27;s—ROF Ranskill and ROF Wrexham—were also opened. Cordite produced in these factories was sent to filling factories for filling into ammunition.

=== MoS Agency Factories and ICI Nobel in World War II ===
The British Government set up additional cordite factories, not under Royal Ordnance Factory control but as Agency Factories run on behalf of the Ministry of Supply (MoS). The company of ICI Nobel, at Ardeer, was asked in 1939 to construct and operate six factories in southern Scotland. Four of these six were involved in cordite or firearm-propellant manufacture. The works at MoS Drungans (Dumfries) produced guncotton that was converted to cordite at MoS Dalbeattie (triple-base cordite) and at MoS Powfoot (monobase granulated guncotton for small-arms). A smaller site at Girvan, South Ayrshire, now occupied by Grant&#x27;s distillery, produced cordite and TNT. The ICI Ardeer site also had a mothballed World War I Government-owned cordite factory.

35% of British cordite produced between 1942 and 1945 came from Ardeer and these agency factories. ICI ran a similar works at Deer Park (which was also confusingly known as Ardeer after the adjacent suburb) near Melbourne in Australia and in South Africa.

=== Overseas supplies ===
Additional sources of propellant were also sought from the British Commonwealth in both World War I and World War II. Canada, South Africa, and Australia had ICI-owned factories that, in particular, supplied large quantities of cordite.

==== World War I ====

Canadian Explosives Limited was formed in 1910 to produce rifle cordite, at its Beloeil factory, for the Quebec Arsenal. By November 1915 production had been expanded to produce 350,000 lb (159,000 kg) of cordite per month for the Imperial Munitions Board.

The Imperial Munitions Board set up a number of additional explosives factories in Canada. It built &quot;The British Cordite Ltd&quot; factory at Nobel, Ontario, in 1916/1917, to produce cordite. Production started in mid-1917.

Canadian Explosives Limited built an additional cordite factory at Nobel, Ontario. Work started in February 1918 and was finished on 24 August 1918. It was designed to produce 1,500,000 lb (681,000 kg) of cordite per month.

Factories, specifically &quot;heavy industry&quot; (Long, and Marland 2009) were important for the provision of munitions. Cordite factories typically employed women (Cook 2006) who put their lives at risk as they packed the shells.

== Production quantities ==
Large quantities of cordite were manufactured in both World Wars for use by the military.

===Pre-World War I===
Prior to World War I, most of the cordite used by the British Government was produced in its own factories. Immediately prior to World War I, between 6,000 and 8,000 tons per year of cordite were produced in the United Kingdom by private manufacturers; between 1,000 and 1,500 tons per year were made by Nobel&#x27;s Explosives, at Ardeer. However, private industry had the capability to produce about 10,000 tons per year, with Ardeer able to produce some 3,000 tons of this total.

=== World War I ===
At the start of World War I, private industry in the UK was asked to produce 16,000 tons of cordite, and all the companies started to expand. HM Factory, Gretna, the largest propellant factory in the United Kingdom, which opened in 1916, was by 1917 producing 800 tons (812 tonne) of Cordite RDB per week (approximately 41,600 tons per year). The Royal Navy had its own factory at Holton Heath.

In 1910, Canadian Explosives Limited produced 3,000 lb (1,362 kg) of rifle cordite per month at its Beloeil factory, for the Quebec Arsenal. By November 1915 production had been expanded to 350,000 lb (159,000 kg) of cordite per month (approximately 1,900 tonnes per year). The Canadian Explosives Limited cordite factory at Nobel, Ontario, was designed to produce 1,500,000 lb (681 tonne) of cordite per month (approximately 8,170 tonnes per year).

=== Between wars ===
HM Factory, Gretna, and the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath, both closed after the end of the war and the Gretna factory was dismantled. This left the Waltham Abbey and Ardeer factories in production.

=== World War II ===
As noted above, in addition to its own facilities, the British Government had ICI Nobel set up a number of Agency Factories producing cordite in Scotland, Australia, Canada and South Africa.

<doc id="58245" wikidata="Q16141544" url="?curid=58245" title="Ethnic groups in Chinese history">
<text>Ethnic groups in Chinese history refer to various or presumed ethnicities of significance to the history of China, gathered through the study of Classical Chinese literature, Chinese and non-Chinese literary sources and inscriptions, historical linguistics, and archaeological research.

Among the difficulties in the study of ethnic groups in China are the relatively long periods of time involved, together with the large volume of literary and historical records which have accompanied the history of China. Classical Chinese ethnography (like much premodern ethnography) was often sketchy, leaving it unclear as to whether Chinese-depicted names referred to a true ethnic group or a possibly multiethnic political entity. Even then, ethnonyms were sometimes assigned by geographic location or surrounding features, rather than by any features of the people themselves, and often carried little distinction of who the Han Chinese authors considered Chinese and non-Chinese for differences such as lifestyle, language, or governance. Many of the ethnonyms were historically used in such a way as to invite comparison with the word &quot;barbarian&quot;.

==English names==

The Chinese exonyms of various ethnic groups encountered in Chinese history can be rendered into English either by transliteration or translation; for instance, &quot;Dí&quot; is transliterated as &quot;Di&quot; (or &quot;Ti&quot;) or translated as &quot;Northern Barbarians&quot;. In some cases authors prefer to transliterate specific exonyms as proper nouns, and in other cases to translate generic ones as English &quot;barbarian&quot; (for instance, &quot;Four Barbarians&quot;). The American sinologist Marc S. Abramson explains why &quot;barbarian&quot; is the appropriate translation for general terms like &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; , but not specific ones like &quot;fancai&quot; 番菜 &quot;foreign-style food&quot;.
Translations such as &quot;foreigner&quot; and &quot;alien,&quot; though possessing an air of scholarly neutrality, are inappropriate as a general translation because they primarily connote geographic and political outsiderness, implying that individuals and groups so designated were external to the Tang Empire and ineligible to become subjects of the empire. This was frequently not the case with many uses of &quot;fan&quot; and related terms — most common among them were &quot;hu&quot; (often used in the Tang to denote Central Asians) and four ethnonyms of great antiquity that, by the Tang, were mostly used generically with implicit geographic connotations: &quot;yi&quot; (east), &quot;man&quot; (south), &quot;rong&quot; (west), and &quot;di&quot; (north) — that largely connoted cultural and ethnic otherness but did not exclude the designated persons or groups from membership in the empire. Although the term &quot;barbarian&quot; has undergone many transformations from its Greek origins to its current English usage, not all of which are relevant to the Tang (such as its use in medieval Europe to denote religious difference, marking non-Christians of various ethnic, geographic, and political affiliations), its consistent association with inferiority, lack of civilization, and externality in the broadest sense often make it the most appropriate choice, including some cases when it is placed in the mouths of non-Han referring to themselves or others. However, its pejorative connotations make it inappropriate as a general translation. Thus, I have chosen not to translate these terms when they designate particular groups, individuals, or phenomena and do not refer to a specific ethnic group, language, geographic place, or cultural complex.

==List of ethnic groups==

<doc id="58246" wikidata="Q143874" url="?curid=58246" title="Nitrocellulose">
<text>Nitrocellulose (also known as cellulose nitrate, flash paper, flash cotton, guncotton, pyroxylin and flash string, depending on form) is a highly flammable compound formed by nitrating cellulose through exposure to a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. One of its first major uses was as guncotton, a replacement for gunpowder as propellant in firearms. It was also used to replace gunpowder as a low-order explosive in mining and other applications. In the form of collodion it was also a critical component in an early photographic emulsion, the use of which revolutionized photography in the 1860s. In the 20th century it was adapted to automobile lacquer and adhesives.

==Production==
The process uses a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid to convert cellulose into nitrocellulose. The quality of the cellulose is important. Hemicellulose, lignin, pentosans, and mineral salts give inferior nitrocelluloses. In precise chemical terms, nitrocellulose is not a nitro compound, but a nitrate ester. The glucose repeat unit (anhydroglucose) within the cellulose chain has three OH groups, each of which can form a nitrate ester. Thus, nitrocellulose can denote mononitrocellulose, dinitrocellulose, and trinitrocellulose, or a mixture thereof. With fewer OH groups than the parent cellulose, nitrocelluloses do not aggregate by hydrogen bonding. The overarching consequence is that the nitrocellulose is soluble in organic solvents such as acetone and esters; e.g., ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, ethyl carbonate. Most lacquers are prepared from the dinitrate, whereas explosives are mainly the trinitrate.

The chemical equation for the formation of the trinitrate is
:3 HNO3 + C6H7(OH)3O2 C6H7(ONO2)3O2 + 3 H2O
The yields are about 85%, with losses attributed to complete oxidation of the cellulose to oxalic acid.

==Use==

The principal uses of cellulose nitrate is for the production of lacquers and coatings, explosives, and celluloid.

In terms of lacquers and coatings, nitrocellulose dissolves readily in organic solvents, which upon evaporation leave a colorless, transparent, flexible film. Nitrocellulose lacquers have been used as a finish on furniture and musical instruments.

Guncotton, dissolved at about 25% in acetone, forms a lacquer used in preliminary stages of wood finishing to develop a hard finish with a deep lustre. It is normally the first coat applied, then it is sanded and followed by other coatings that bond to it.

Nail polish contains nitrocellulose, as it is inexpensive, dries quickly to a hard film, and does not damage skin.

The explosive applications are diverse and nitrate content is typically higher for propellant applications than for coatings. For space flight, nitrocellulose was used by Copenhagen Suborbitals on several missions as a means of jettisoning components of the rocket/space capsule and deploying recovery systems. However, after several missions and flights, it proved not to have the desired explosive properties in a near vacuum environment. In 2014, the Philae comet lander failed to deploy its harpoons because its 0.3 grams of nitrocellulose propulsion charges failed to fire during the landing.

=== Other uses ===
Collodion, a solution of nitrocellulose, is used today in topical skin applications, such as liquid skin and in the application of salicylic acid, the active ingredient in Compound W wart remover. 

====Laboratory uses====
* Membrane filters made of a mesh of nitrocellulose threads with various porosities are used in laboratory procedures for particle retention and cell capture in liquid or gaseous solutions and, reversely, obtaining particle-free filtrates.
* A nitrocellulose slide, nitrocellulose membrane, or nitrocellulose paper is a sticky membrane used for immobilizing nucleic acids in southern blots and northern blots. It is also used for immobilization of proteins in western blots and atomic force microscopy for its nonspecific affinity for amino acids. Nitrocellulose is widely used as support in diagnostic tests where antigen-antibody binding occurs; e.g., pregnancy tests, U-albumin tests, and CRP tests. Glycine and chloride ions make protein transfer more efficient.
* Radon tests for alpha track etches use nitrocellulose.
* Adolph Noé developed a method of peeling coal balls using nitrocellulose.
* It is used to coat playing cards and to bind staples together in office staplers.

====Hobbies====
*In 1846, nitrated cellulose was found to be soluble in ether and alcohol. The solution was named collodion and was soon used as a dressing for wounds.

*In 1851, Frederick Scott Archer invented the wet collodion process as a replacement for albumen in early photographic emulsions, binding light-sensitive silver halides to a glass plate.
*Magicians&#x27; flash paper are sheets of paper consisting of pure nitrocellulose, which burn almost instantly with a bright flash, leaving no ash or smoke.

* Nitrocellulose lacquer is spin-coated onto aluminium or glass discs, then a groove is cut with a lathe, to make one-off phonograph records, used as masters for pressing or for play in dance clubs. They are referred to as acetate discs.
* Depending on the manufacturing process, nitrocellulose is esterified to varying degrees. Table tennis balls, guitar picks, and some photographic films have fairly low esterification levels and burn comparatively slowly with some charred residue.
==Historical uses==
=== Early work on nitration of cellulose ===

In 1832 Henri Braconnot discovered that nitric acid, when combined with starch or wood fibers, would produce a lightweight combustible explosive material, which he named &quot;xyloïdine&quot;. A few years later in 1838, another French chemist, Théophile-Jules Pelouze (teacher of Ascanio Sobrero and Alfred Nobel), treated paper and cardboard in the same way. Jean-Baptiste Dumas obtained a similar material, which he called &quot;nitramidine&quot;.

====Guncotton====
Around 1846 Christian Friedrich Schönbein, a German-Swiss chemist, discovered a more practical formulation. As he was working in the kitchen of his home in Basel, he spilled a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) on the kitchen table. He reached for the nearest cloth, a cotton apron, and wiped it up. He hung the apron on the stove door to dry, and as soon as it was dry, a flash occurred as the apron ignited. His preparation method was the first to be widely used. The method was to immerse one part of fine cotton in 15 parts of an equal blend of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. After two minutes, the cotton was removed and washed in cold water to set the esterification level and to remove all acid residue. The cotton was then slowly dried at a temperature below 40 °C (104 °F). Schönbein collaborated with the Frankfurt professor Rudolf Christian Böttger, who had discovered the process independently in the same year.

By coincidence, a third chemist, the Brunswick professor F. J. Otto had also produced guncotton in 1846 and was the first to publish the process, much to the disappointment of Schönbein and Böttger.

The patent rights for the manufacture of guncotton were obtained by John Hall &amp; Son in 1846, and industrial manufacture of the explosive began at a purpose-built factory at Marsh Works in Faversham, Kent, a year later. The manufacturing process was not properly understood and few safety measures were put in place. A serious explosion in July that killed almost two dozen workers resulted in the immediate closure of the plant. Guncotton manufacture ceased for over 15 years until a safer procedure could be developed.

The British chemist Frederick Augustus Abel developed the first safe process for guncotton manufacture, which he patented in 1865. The washing and drying times of the nitrocellulose were both extended to 48 hours and repeated eight times over. The acid mixture was changed to two parts sulfuric acid to one part nitric. Nitration can be controlled by adjusting acid concentrations and reaction temperature. Nitrocellulose is soluble in a mixture of ethanol and ether until nitrogen concentration exceeds 12%. Soluble nitrocellulose, or a solution thereof, is sometimes called collodion.

Guncotton containing more than 13% nitrogen (sometimes called insoluble nitrocellulose) was prepared by prolonged exposure to hot, concentrated acids for limited use as a blasting explosive or for warheads of underwater weapons such as naval mines and torpedoes. Safe and sustained production of guncotton began at the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills in the 1860s, and the material rapidly became the dominant explosive, becoming the standard for military warheads, although it remained too potent to be used as a propellant. More-stable and slower-burning collodion mixtures were eventually prepared using less concentrated acids at lower temperatures for smokeless powder in firearms. The first practical smokeless powder made from nitrocellulose, for firearms and artillery ammunition, was invented by French chemist Paul Vieille in 1884.

Jules Verne viewed the development of guncotton with optimism. He referred to the substance several times in his novels. His adventurers carried firearms employing this substance. In his &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, guncotton was used to launch a projectile into space.

Because of their fluffy and nearly white appearance, nitrocellulose products are often referred to as cottons, e.g. lacquer cotton, celluloid cotton, and gun cotton.

Guncotton was originally made from cotton (as the source of cellulose) but contemporary methods use highly processed cellulose from wood pulp. While guncotton is dangerous to store, the hazards it presents can be minimized by storing it dampened with various liquids, such as alcohol. For this reason, accounts of guncotton usage dating from the early 20th century refer to &quot;wet guncotton.&quot;

The power of guncotton made it suitable for blasting. As a projectile driver, it had around six times the gas generation of an equal volume of black powder and produced less smoke and less heating.

Artillery shells filled with gun cotton were widely used during the American Civil War, and its use was one of the reasons the conflict was seen as the &quot;first modern war.&quot; In combination with breech-loading artillery, such high explosive shells could cause greater damage than previous solid cannonballs.

During the first World War, British authorities were slow to introduce grenades, with soldiers at the front improvising by filling ration tin cans with gun cotton, scrap and a basic fuse.

Further research indicated the importance of washing the acidified cotton. Unwashed nitrocellulose (sometimes called pyrocellulose) may spontaneously ignite and explode at room temperature, as the evaporation of water results in the concentration of unreacted acid.

=== Film ===
In 1855, the first human-made plastic, nitrocellulose (branded Parkesine, patented in 1862), was created by Alexander Parkes from cellulose treated with nitric acid and a solvent. In 1868, American inventor John Wesley Hyatt developed a plastic material he named Celluloid, improving on Parkes&#x27; invention by plasticizing the nitrocellulose with camphor so that it could be processed into a photographic film. This was used commercially as &quot;celluloid&quot;, a highly flammable plastic that until the mid-20th century formed the basis for lacquers and photographic film.

On May 2, 1887, Hannibal Goodwin filed a patent for &quot;a photographic pellicle and process of producing same ... especially in connection with roller cameras&quot;, but the patent was not granted until September 13, 1898. In the meantime, George Eastman had already started production of roll-film using his own process.

Nitrocellulose was used as the first flexible film base, beginning with Eastman Kodak products in August 1889. Camphor is used as a plasticizer for nitrocellulose film, often called nitrate film. Goodwin&#x27;s patent was sold to Ansco, which successfully sued Eastman Kodak for infringement of the patent and was awarded $5,000,000 in 1914 to Goodwin Film.

====Nitrate film fires====
Disastrous fires related to celluloid or &quot;nitrate film&quot; became regular occurrences in the motion picture industry throughout the silent era and for many years after the arrival of sound film. Projector fires and spontaneous combustion of nitrate footage stored in studio vaults and in other structures were often blamed during the early to mid 20th century for destroying or heavily damaging cinemas, inflicting many serious injuries and deaths, and for reducing to ashes the master negatives and original prints of tens of thousands of screen titles, turning many of them into lost films. Even when nitrate stock did not start the blaze, flames from other sources spread to large nearby film collections, producing intense and highly destructive fires.

In 1914the same year that Goodwin Film was awarded $5,000,000 from Kodak for patent infringementnitrate film fires incinerated a significant portion of the United States&#x27; early cinematic history. In that year alone, five very destructive fires occurred at four major studios and a film-processing plant. Millions of feet of film burned on March 19 at the Eclair Moving Picture Company in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Later that same month, many more reels and film cans of negatives and prints also burned at Edison Studios in New York City, in the Bronx. On May 13, a fire at Universal Pictures&#x27; Colonial Hall &quot;film factory&quot; in Manhattan consumed another extensive collection. Yet again, on June 13 in Philadelphia, a fire and a series of explosions ignited inside the 186-square-meter (2,000-square-foot) film vault of the Lubin Manufacturing Company and quickly wiped out virtually all of that studio&#x27;s pre-1914 catalogue. Then a second fire hit the Edison Company at another location on December 9, at its film-processing complex in West Orange, New Jersey. That catastrophic fire started inside a film-inspection building and caused over $7,000,000 in property damages ($ today). Even after film technology changed, archives of older films remained vulnerable; the 1965 MGM vault fire burned many films that were decades old.

The use of volatile nitrocellulose film for motion pictures led many cinemas to fireproof their projection rooms with wall coverings made of asbestos. Those additions intended to prevent or at least delay the migration of flames beyond the projection areas. A training film for projectionists included footage of a controlled ignition of a reel of nitrate film, which continued to burn even when fully submerged in water. Once burning, it is extremely difficult to extinguish. Unlike most other flammable materials, nitrocellulose does not need a source of air to continue burning, since it contains sufficient oxygen within its molecular structure to sustain a flame. For this reason, immersing burning film in water may not extinguish it, and could actually increase the amount of smoke produced. Owing to public safety precautions, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Health and Safety Executive to this day forbids transportation of nitrate film by post or public transit, or disposal with household refuse.

Cinema fires caused by the ignition of nitrocellulose film stock commonly occurred as well. In Ireland in 1926, it was blamed for the Dromcolliher cinema tragedy in County Limerick in which 48 people died. Then in 1929 at the Glen Cinema in Paisley, Scotland, a film-related fire killed 69 children. Today, nitrate film projection is rare and normally highly regulated and requires extensive precautions, including extra health-and-safety training for projectionists. A special projector certified to run nitrate films has many modifications, among them the chambering of the feed and takeup reels in thick metal covers with small slits to allow the film to run through them. The projector is additionally modified to accommodate several fire extinguishers with nozzles aimed at the film gate. The extinguishers automatically trigger if a piece of film near the gate starts to burn. While this triggering would likely damage or destroy a significant portion of the projector&#x27;s components, it would contain a fire and prevent far greater damage. Projection rooms may also be required to have automatic metal covers for the projection windows, preventing the spread of fire to the auditorium. Today, the Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum is one of a few theaters in the world that is capable of safely projecting nitrate films and regularly screens them to the public. The BFI Southbank in London is the only cinema in the United Kingdom licensed to show Nitrate Film.

The use of nitrate film and its fiery potential were certainly not issues limited to the realm of motion pictures or to commercial still photography. The film was also used for many years in medicine, where its hazardous nature was most acute, especially in its application to X-ray photography. In 1929, several tons of stored X-ray film were ignited by steam from a broken heating pipe at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. That tragedy claimed 123 lives during the fire and additional fatalities several days later, when hospitalized victims died due to inhaling excessive amounts of smoke from the burning film, which was laced with toxic gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen cyanide. Related fires in other medical facilities prompted the growing disuse of nitrocellulose stock for X-rays by 1933, nearly two decades before its use was discontinued for motion-picture films in favour of cellulose acetate film, more commonly known as &quot;safety film&quot;.

===Nitrocellulose decomposition and new &quot;safety&quot; stocks===
Nitrocellulose was found to gradually decompose, releasing nitric acid and further catalyzing the decomposition (eventually into a flammable powder). Decades later, storage at low temperatures was discovered as a means of delaying these reactions indefinitely. Many films produced during the early 20th century were lost through this accelerating, self-catalyzed disintegration or through studio warehouse fires, and many others were deliberately destroyed specifically to avoid the fire risk. Salvaging old films is a major problem for film archivists (see film preservation).

Nitrocellulose film base manufactured by Kodak can be identified by the presence of the word &quot;nitrate&quot; in dark letters along one edge; the word only in clear letters on a dark background indicates derivation from a nitrate base original negative or projection print, but the film in hand itself may be a later print or copy negative, made on safety film. Acetate film manufactured during the era when nitrate films were still in use was marked &quot;Safety&quot; or &quot;Safety Film&quot; along one edge in dark letters. 8, 9.5, and 16 mm film stocks, intended for amateur and other nontheatrical use, were never manufactured with a nitrate base in the west, but rumors exist of 16 mm nitrate film having been produced in the former Soviet Union and China.

Nitrate dominated the market for professional-use 35 mm motion picture film from the industry&#x27;s origins to the early 1950s. While cellulose acetate-based safety film, notably cellulose diacetate and cellulose acetate propionate, was produced in the gauge for small-scale use in niche applications (such as printing advertisements and other short films to enable them to be sent through the mails without the need for fire safety precautions), the early generations of safety film base had two major disadvantages relative to nitrate: it was much more expensive to manufacture, and considerably less durable in repeated projection. The cost of the safety precautions associated with the use of nitrate was significantly lower than the cost of using any of the safety bases available before 1948. These drawbacks were eventually overcome with the launch of cellulose triacetate base film by Eastman Kodak in 1948. Cellulose triacetate superseded nitrate as the film industry&#x27;s mainstay base very quickly. While Kodak had discontinued some nitrate film stocks earlier, it stopped producing various nitrate roll films in 1950 and ceased production of nitrate 35 mm motion picture film in 1951.

The crucial advantage cellulose triacetate had over nitrate was that it was no more of a fire risk than paper (the stock is often referred to as &quot;non-flam&quot;: this is true—but it is combustible, just not in as volatile or as dangerous a way as nitrate), while it almost matched the cost and durability of nitrate. It remained in almost exclusive use in all film gauges until the 1980s, when polyester/PET film began to supersede it for intermediate and release printing.

Polyester is much more resistant to polymer degradation than either nitrate or triacetate. Although triacetate does not decompose in as dangerous a way as nitrate does, it is still subject to a process known as deacetylation, often nicknamed &quot;vinegar syndrome&quot; (due to the acetic acid smell of decomposing film) by archivists, which causes the film to shrink, deform, become brittle and eventually unusable. PET, like cellulose mononitrate, is less prone to stretching than other available plastics. By the late 1990s, polyester had almost entirely superseded triacetate for the production of intermediate elements and release prints.

Triacetate remains in use for most camera negative stocks because it can be &quot;invisibly&quot; spliced using solvents during negative assembly, while polyester film is usually spliced using adhesive tape patches, which leave visible marks in the frame area. However, ultrasonic splicing in the frame line area can be invisible. Also, polyester film is so strong, it will not break under tension and may cause serious damage to expensive camera or projector mechanisms in the event of a film jam, whereas triacetate film breaks easily, reducing the risk of damage. Many were opposed to the use of polyester for release prints for this reason, and because ultrasonic splicers are very expensive, beyond the budgets of many smaller theaters. In practice, though, this has not proved to be as much of a problem as was feared. Rather, with the increased use of automated long-play systems in cinemas, the greater strength of polyester has been a significant advantage in lessening the risk of a film performance being interrupted by a film break.

Despite its self-oxidizing hazards, nitrate is still regarded highly as the stock is more transparent than replacement stocks, and older films used denser silver in the emulsion. The combination results in a notably more luminous image with a high contrast ratio.

===Fabric ===
The solubility of nitrocellulose was the basis for the first &quot;artificial silk&quot; by Georges Audemars in 1855, which he called &quot;Rayon&quot;.. However, Hilaire de Chardonnet was the first to patent a nitrocellulose fiber marketed as &quot;artificial silk&quot; at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was flammable and more expensive than cellulose acetate or cuprammonium rayon. Because of this predicament, production ceased early in the 1900s. Nitrocellulose was briefly known as &quot;mother-in-law silk&quot;.

Frank Hastings Griffin invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing. Nathan Rosenstein invented the &quot;spunize process&quot; by which he turned rayon from a hard fiber to a fabric. This allowed rayon to become a popular raw material in textiles.

===Coatings===
Nitrocellulose lacquer manufactured by (among others) DuPont, was the primary material for painting automobiles for many years. Durability of finish, complexities of &quot;multiple stage&quot; modern finishes, and other factors including environmental regulation led manufacturers to choose newer technologies. It remained the favorite of hobbyists for both historical reasons and for the ease with which a professional finish can be obtained. Most automobile &quot;touch up&quot; paints are still made from lacquer because of its fast drying, easy application, and superior adhesion properties – regardless of the material used for the original finish. Guitars sometimes shared color codes with current automobiles. It fell out of favor for mass production use for a number of reasons including environmental regulation and the cost of application vs. polyurethane finishes. However, Gibson still use nitrocellulose lacquers on all of their guitars, as well as Fender when reproducing historically accurate guitars. The nitrocellulose lacquer yellows and cracks over time, and custom shops will reproduce this aging to make instruments appear vintage. Guitars made by smaller shops (luthiers) also often use &quot;nitro&quot; as it has an almost mythical status among guitarists.

== Hazards ==
Because of its explosive nature, not all applications of nitrocellulose were successful. In 1869, with elephants having been poached to near extinction, the billiards industry offered a US$10,000 prize to whoever came up with the best replacement for ivory billiard balls. John Wesley Hyatt created the winning replacement, which he created with a new material he invented, called camphored nitrocellulose—the first thermoplastic, better known as celluloid. The invention enjoyed a brief popularity, but the Hyatt balls were extremely flammable, and sometimes portions of the outer shell would explode upon impact. An owner of a billiard saloon in Colorado wrote to Hyatt about the explosive tendencies, saying that he did not mind very much personally but for the fact that every man in his saloon immediately pulled a gun at the sound. The process used by Hyatt to manufacture the billiard balls, patented in 1881, involved placing the mass of nitrocellulose in a rubber bag, which was then placed in a cylinder of liquid and heated. Pressure was applied to the liquid in the cylinder, which resulted in a uniform compression on the nitrocellulose mass, compressing it into a uniform sphere as the heat vaporized the solvents. The ball was then cooled and turned to make a uniform sphere. In light of the explosive results, this process was called the &quot;Hyatt gun method&quot;.

An overheated container of dry nitrocellulose is believed to be the initial cause of the 2015 Tianjin explosions.

<doc id="58249" wikidata="Q1128240" url="?curid=58249" title="Earl">
<text>Earl () is a rank of the nobility in the United Kingdom. In modern Britain, an earl is a member of the peerage, ranking below a marquess and above a viscount. A feminine form of &quot;earl&quot; never developed; instead, &quot;countess&quot; is used.

The title originates in the Old English word , meaning &quot;a man of noble birth or rank&quot;. The word is cognate with the Scandinavian form &quot;jarl&quot;. After the Norman Conquest, it became the equivalent of the continental count. In Scotland, it assimilated the concept of mormaer. Since the 1960s, earldoms have typically been created only for members of the royal family. The last non-royal earldom, Earl of Stockton, was created in 1984 for Harold Macmillan, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.

Alternative names for the rank equivalent to &quot;earl&quot; or &quot;count&quot; in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as the &quot;hakushaku&quot; (伯爵) of the post-restoration Japanese Imperial era.

== Etymology ==
In the 7th century, the common Old English terms for nobility was or . However, this was later replaced by the term &quot;thegn&quot;. In the 11th century, under Danish influence, the Old English title &quot;ealdorman&quot; became &quot;earl&quot;, from the Old Norse word . Proto-Norse &quot;eril&quot;, or the later Old Norse , came to signify the rank of a leader.

The Norman-derived equivalent &quot;count&quot; (from Latin ) was not introduced following the Norman Conquest of England though &quot;countess&quot; was and is used for the female title. Geoffrey Hughes writes, &quot;It is a likely speculation that the Norman French title &#x27;Count&#x27; was abandoned in England in favour of the Germanic &#x27;Earl&#x27; [...] precisely because of the uncomfortable phonetic proximity to cunt&quot;.

In the other languages of Great Britain and Ireland, the term is translated as: Welsh , Irish and Scottish Gaelic , Scots , or , Cornish .

== England ==

=== Anglo-Saxon period ===

==== Ealdorman ====

The office of earl evolved from the ealdorman, an office within Anglo-Saxon government. The English king appointed the ealdorman to be the chief officer in a shire. He commanded the local fyrd and presided over the shire court alongside the bishop. As compensation, he received the : one-third of the shire court&#x27;s profits and the boroughs&#x27; revenues. Initially, the ealdorman governed a single shire. Starting with Edward the Elder (), it became customary for one ealdorman to administer three or four shires together as an ealdormanry.

==== Cnut the Great ====
During Cnut&#x27;s reign (1016–1035), &quot;ealdorman&quot; changed to &quot;earl&quot; (related to Old English and Scandinavian ). Cnut&#x27;s realm, the North Sea Empire, extended beyond England, forcing him to delegate power to earls. Earls were governors or viceroys, ruling in the king&#x27;s name, keeping the peace, dispensing justice, and raising armies. Like the earlier ealdormen, they received the third penny from their jurisdictions. Earls ranked above thegns in precedence and were the chief counselors in the witan (king&#x27;s council).

The office of earl was not hereditary. While sons of earls could expect to inherit their father&#x27;s office, this was not automatic. Only the king could make someone an earl.

Initially, Cnut kept Wessex for himself and divided the rest of England into three earldoms. He gave the earldom of East Anglia to Thorkell the Tall and the earldom of Northumbria to Eric. Eadric Streona retained the earldom of Mercia (having been unified with western Mercia in the tenure of earldorman Ælfhere), which he had held since 1007. Cnut gave Godwin the earldom of Wessex in 1018. Eventually Godwin was also granted the earldom of Kent. Thorkell vanished from the records after 1023, and Godwin became the leading earl.

Earldoms were not permanent territorial divisions; kings could transfer shires from one earldom to another. The fact that there was no local government administration beyond the shire also limited the autonomy of the earls. They could not raise taxation, mint coins, issue charters, or hold their own courts (the shire courts that earls presided over were held in the king&#x27;s name).

F. W. Maitland wrote, &quot;with the estates of the earls, we find it impossible to distinguish between private property and official property&quot;. He noted the existence of &quot;manors of the shire&quot; and &quot;comital vills&quot; that belonged to the office rather than the officeholder. Stephen Baxter argued that given the evidence, it must be &quot;assumed that the &#x27;comital manors&#x27; in each shire could be transferred by the king from one earl to another with relative ease&quot;. However, not all scholars agree with the existence of such &quot;comital&quot; property.

==== Edward the Confessor ====
During the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066), the earls were still royal officers governing their earldoms in the king&#x27;s name. However, they were developing more autonomy and becoming a threat to royal power. Three great aristocratic families had emerged: the Godwins of Wessex, Leofric of Mercia, and Siward of Northumbria. 

In theory, earls could be removed by the king. Edward deliberately broke the hereditary succession to Northumbria when Earl Siward died in 1055. He ignored the claims of Siward&#x27;s son, Waltheof, and appointed Tostig Godwinson as earl. The earldom of East Anglia appears to have been used as a training ground for new earls. Nevertheless, the earldoms of Wessex and Mercia were becoming hereditary. For four generations, Mercia was passed from father to son: Leofwine, Leofric, Ælfgar, and Edwin. 

To reward Godwin for his support, Edward made his eldest son, Sweyn, an earl in 1043. Harold, Godwin&#x27;s second oldest son, was made the earl of East Anglia. In 1045, an earldom was created for Godwin&#x27;s nephew, Beorn Estrithson. After Sweyn left England in disgrace in 1047, some of his estates were taken over by Harold and Beorn. Ralf of Mantes, Edward&#x27;s Norman nephew, was made earl of Hereford, a territory formerly part of Sweyn&#x27;s earldom. 

In 1053, Harold succeeded his father, and Ælfgar, son of Earl Leofric, became earl of East Anglia. A major reshuffle occurred after both Leofric and Ralf died in 1057. Ælfgar succeeded his father in Mercia, and Gyrth Godwinson took East Anglia. An earldom was created for Leofwine Godwinson out of the south-eastern shires belonging to Harold. In exchange, Harold received Ralf&#x27;s earldom. 

In 1065, a rebellion deposed Tostig and recognised Morcar, the brother of Earl Edwin of Mercia, as Northumbria&#x27;s new earl. The king accepted this, and Tostig was expelled from England.

In 1066, according to the Domesday Book, the Godwin family estates were valued at £7,000, Earl Leofric of Mercia at £2,400, and Earl Siward of Northumbria at £350. In comparison, the king&#x27;s lands were valued at £5,000. This concentration of land and wealth in the hands of the earls, and one family in particular, weakened the Crown&#x27;s authority. The situation was reversed when Harold Godwinson became king, and he was able to restore the Crown&#x27;s authority.

=== Norman Conquest ===

The Norman Conquest of 1066 introduced a new Anglo-Norman aristocracy that gradually replaced the old Anglo-Saxon elite. In Normandy, a duchy in the Kingdom of France, the equivalent of an earl was a count. The definition and powers of French counts varied widely. Some counts were nearly independent rulers who gave only nominal loyalty to the King of France. In Normandy, counts were junior members of the Norman dynasty with responsibility for guarding border regions. In 1066, there were three Norman counts: Richard of Évreux, Robert of Eu, and Robert of Mortain. 

William the Conqueror () reduced the size of earldoms; those created after 1071 had responsibility for one shire. Like Norman counts, earls became military governors assigned to vulnerable border or coastal areas. To protect the Welsh Marches, the king made Roger de Montgomery the earl of Shrewsbury and Hugh d&#x27;Avranches the earl of Chester . Likewise, the king&#x27;s half-brother Odo of Bayeux was made earl of Kent to guard the English Channel. 

After the Revolt of the Earls in 1075, only four earldoms remained, all held by Anglo-Normans: Kent, Shrewsbury, Chester, and Northumbria. This number was reduced to three after 1082 when Odo of Bayeux was arrested and deprived of Kent. At the death of William Rufus in 1100, there were five earldoms: Chester, Shrewsbury, Surrey (or Warrenne), Warwick, and Huntingdon–Northampton. In 1122, Henry I made his illegitimate son Robert the earl of Gloucester.

After the Conquest, new earldoms tended to be named for the city and castle in which they were based. Some titles became attached to the family name rather than location. For example, the holder of the earldom of Surrey was more commonly called &quot;Earl Warenne&quot;. The same was true of the earldom of Buckingham, whose holder was called &quot;Earl Gifford&quot;. These earls may have preferred to be known by family names that were older and more prestigious than their newer territorial designations.

=== Stephen and Matilda ===
The number of earls rose from seven in 1135 to twenty in 1141 as King Stephen () created twelve new earls to reward supporters during the Anarchy, the civil war fought with his cousin Empress Matilda for the English throne. In 1138, Stephen created eight new earldoms:

# Waleran de Beaumont, who was already Count of Meulan in Normandy and the twin brother of the 2nd Earl of Leicester, was made earl of Worcester. 
# Waleran&#x27;s younger brother Hugh de Beaumont was made earl of Bedford.
# Gilbert de Clare was made earl of Pembroke.
# Gilbert de Clare, nephew of the Earl of Pembroke, was made earl of Hertford.
# William de Aumale was made earl of York in reward for service during the Battle of the Standard.
# Robert de Ferrers was made earl of Derby in reward for service during the Battle of the Standard. 
# William d&#x27;Aubigny was made earl of Lincoln.
# William de Roumare was made earl of Cambridge.

In 1140, Roumare was given the earldom of Lincoln in exchange for Cambridge, and William d&#x27;Aubigny received the earldom of Sussex (commonly known as Arundel). The same year, Geoffrey de Mandeville was made earl of Essex, and his is the oldest surviving charter of creation. Around the same time, Hugh Bigod was made earl of Norfolk.

In February 1141, Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln, and Empress Matilda elected &quot;Lady of the English&quot; in April. At this time, she created three earldoms for her own supporters. Her illegitimate brother Reginald de Dunstanville was made earl of Cornwall. Baldwin de Redvers was made earl of Devon, and William de Mohun, lord of Dunster, was made earl of Somerset. Aubrey de Vere was made earl of Oxford in 1142. Sometime around 1143, Matilda&#x27;s constable Patrick of Salisbury was made earl of Salisbury.

During the Anarchy, earls took advantage of the power vacuum to assume Crown rights. Robert of Gloucester, Patrick of Salisbury, Robert of Leicester, and Henry of Northumbria all minted their own coinage. Earls and barons had also built adulterine castles (castles built without royal permission).

=== Plantagenets ===

It fell to Stephen&#x27;s successor Henry II () to again curtail the power of earls. He confiscated or demolished illegal castles. He reduced the number of earldoms by allowing them to die with their holders and did not create new ones. During his reign, &quot;the title became a mark of rank, rather than a substantive office: the real power lay with the king&#x27;s sheriffs and justices.&quot;

The real power possessed by any individual earl in this period depended on the amount of land and wealth he possessed that could be translated into patronage and influence. The more land and resources concentrated in a region, the more influence an earl had. The most powerful were the earls of Chester, who by the middle of the 13th century were described as earls palatine. Their power derived from owning most of the land in Cheshire. As a result, the shire court and the earl&#x27;s honour court were identical, and the sheriff answered to the earl. The earl of Oxford possessed less than an acre of land in Oxfordshire (most of his land was in Essex), and therefore possessed no power in the county.

An earldom along with its land was inherited generally according to primogeniture. If the only heirs were female, then the land would be partitioned equally between co-heirs with the eldest co-heir receiving the title. In 1204, Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester, died without children. His heirs were his sisters, Amice and Margaret. Amice&#x27;s son, Simon de Montfort, succeeded as earl of Leicester, and Margaret&#x27;s husband, Saer de Quincy, was created the earl of Winchester in 1207. This was the first new hereditary earldom created since the reign of Stephen.

An earldom could be dramatically impacted upon by multiple partitions. In 1232, Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester died childless. His lands were divided between his four sisters with the title going to the eldest&#x27;s son, John of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon. John died in 1237, and once again the estate had to be divided between five co-heirs (the two daughters of his eldest sister and his three surviving sisters). Before the land could be divided, King Alexander II of Scotland claimed the earldom of Huntingdon. While the king&#x27;s council dismissed this claim, the Scottish king was granted the lands attached to Huntingdon but not the title. This reduced the land available to John&#x27;s co-heirs and created the possibility of an earl who was virtually landless. Earl Ranulf had been the greatest landholder in England, but after two partitions in five years, the land granted to each co-heir was small. William de Forz, husband of the senior co-heir, argued that as a county palatine the earldom of Chester should not be partitioned, but this argument was rejected by the king&#x27;s court. Ultimately, the king himself gained possession of all the lands attached to the Chester earldom through a series of land exchanges with the co-heirs.

In 1227, Henry III () granted his justiciar and chief minister, Hubert de Burgh, the earldom of Kent. The terms of inheritance were unprecedented: the earldom was to pass to Hubert&#x27;s son by his third wife Margaret of Scotland, thereby passing over his eldest son by his first wife. It may have been thought that Margaret&#x27;s royal blood made her children more worthy of inheritance.

By the 13th century earls had a social rank just below the king and princes, but were not necessarily more powerful or wealthier than other noblemen. The only way to become an earl was to inherit the title or to marry into one—and the king reserved a right to prevent the transfer of the title. By the 14th century, creating an earl included a special public ceremony where the king personally tied a sword belt around the waist of the new earl, emphasizing the fact that the earl&#x27;s rights came from him.

Earls still held influence and, as &quot;companions of the king&quot;, generally acted in support of the king&#x27;s power. They showed their own power prominently in 1327 when they deposed King Edward II. They would later do the same with other kings of whom they disapproved. In 1337 Edward III declared that he intended to create six new earldoms.

== Ireland ==
The first Irish earldom was the Earl of Ulster, granted to the Norman knight Hugh de Lacy in 1205 by John, King of England and Lord of Ireland. Other early earldoms were Earl of Carrick (1315), Earl of Kildare (1316), Earl of Desmond (1329) and Earl of Waterford (1446, extant).

After the Tudor reconquest of Ireland (1530s–1603), native Irish kings and clan chiefs were encouraged to submit to the English king (now also King of Ireland) and were, in return, granted noble titles in the Peerage of Ireland. Notable among those who agreed to this policy of &quot;surrender and regrant&quot; were Ulick na gCeann Burke, 1st Earl of Clanricarde, Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond, Donald McCarthy, 1st Earl of Clancare, Rory O&#x27;Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, Randal MacDonnell, 1st Earl of Antrim and Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone. The earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell later rebelled against the crown and were forced to flee Ireland in 1607; their departure, along with about ninety followers, is famed in Irish history as the Flight of the Earls, seen as the ultimate demise of native Irish monarchy.

Ireland became part of the United Kingdom in 1801, and the last Irish earldom was created in 1824. The Republic of Ireland does not recognise titles of nobility.

Notable later Irish earls include Jacobite leader Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan; Postmaster General Richard Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty; Prime Minister William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne (later made a marquess); and the (alleged) murderer John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan.

== Scotland ==


The oldest earldoms in Scotland (with the exception of the Earldom of Dunbar and March) originated from the office of mormaer, such as the Mormaer of Fife, of Strathearn, etc.; subsequent earldoms developed by analogy. The principal distinction between earldom and mormaer is that earldoms were granted as fiefs of the King, while mormaers were virtually independent. The &quot;earl&quot; is thought to have been introduced by the anglophile king David I. While the power attached to the office of earl was swept away in England by the Norman Conquest, in Scotland earldoms retained substantial powers, such as regality throughout the Middle Ages.

It is important to distinguish between the land controlled directly by the earl, in a landlord-like sense, and the region over which he could exercise his office. Scottish use of Latin terms and makes the difference clear. Initially these terms were synonymous, as in England, but by the 12th century they were seen as distinct concepts, with &quot;comitatus&quot; referring to the land under direct control of the earl, and referring to the province; hence, the &quot;comitatus&quot; might now only be a small region of the . Thus, unlike England, the term &quot;county&quot;, which ultimately evolved from the Latin , was not historically used for Scotland&#x27;s main political subdivisions.

Sheriffs were introduced at a similar time to earls, but unlike England, where sheriffs were officers who implemented the decisions of the shire court, in Scotland they were specifically charged with upholding the king&#x27;s interests in the region, thus being more like a coroner. As such, a parallel system of justice arose, between that provided by magnates (represented by the earls), and that by the king (represented by sheriffs), in a similar way to England having both Courts Baron and Magistrates, respectively. Inevitably, this led to a degree of forum shopping, with the king&#x27;s offering – the Sheriff – gradually winning.

As in England, as the centuries wore on, the term &quot;earl&quot; came to be disassociated from the office, and later kings started granting the title of &quot;earl&quot; without it, and gradually without even an associated &quot;comitatus&quot;. By the 16th century there started to be earls of towns, of villages, and even of isolated houses; it had simply become a label for marking status, rather than an office of intrinsic power. In 1746, in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising, the Heritable Jurisdictions Act brought the powers of the remaining ancient earldoms under the control of the sheriffs; &quot;earl&quot; is now simply a noble rank.

== Wales ==

Some of the most significant Earls (Welsh: &quot;ieirll&quot;, singular &quot;iarll&quot;) in Welsh history were those from the West of England. As Wales remained independent of any Norman jurisdiction, the more powerful Earls in England were encouraged to invade and establish effective &quot;buffer states&quot; to be run as autonomous lordships. These Marcher Lords included the earls of Chester, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Shrewsbury (see also English Earls of March).

The first Earldoms created within Wales were the Lordship of Glamorgan (a comital title) and the Earldom of Pembroke.

Tir Iarll (English: &quot;Earl&#x27;s land&quot;) is an area of Glamorgan, which has traditionally had a particular resonance in Welsh culture.

== United Kingdom ==

An earldom became, with a few exceptions, the default rank of the peerage to which a former prime minister was elevated. The last prime minister to accept an earldom was Harold Macmillan, who became earl of Stockton in 1984.

==Insignia and forms of address==

=== Coronet ===

A British earl is entitled to a coronet bearing eight strawberry leaves (four visible) and eight silver balls (or pearls) around the rim (five visible). The actual coronet is rarely, if ever, worn except at the coronation of a new monarch, but in heraldry an earl may bear his coronet of rank on his coat of arms above the shield.

=== Forms of address ===

An earl has the title &quot;Earl of [X]&quot; when the title originates from a placename, or &quot;Earl [X]&quot; when the title comes from a surname. In either case, he is referred to as &quot;Lord [X]&quot;, and his wife as &quot;Lady [X]&quot;. A countess who holds an earldom in her own right also uses &quot;Lady [X]&quot;, but her husband does not have a title (unless he has one in his own right).

The eldest son of an earl, though not himself a peer, is entitled to use a courtesy title, usually the highest of his father&#x27;s lesser titles (if any). For instance, prior to his father&#x27;s elevation to the Dukedom of Edinburgh, the eldest son of the Earl of Wessex was styled as James, Viscount Severn. The eldest son of the eldest son of an earl is entitled to use one of his grandfather&#x27;s lesser titles, normally the second-highest of the lesser titles. Younger sons are styled &quot;The Honourable&quot; [&quot;Forename&quot;] [&quot;Surname&quot;], and daughters, &quot;The Lady&quot; [&quot;Forename&quot;] [&quot;Surname&quot;] (Lady Diana Spencer being a well-known example).

There is no difference between the courtesy titles given to the children of earls and the children of countesses in their own right, provided the husband of the countess has a lower rank than she does. If her husband has a higher rank, their children will be given titles according to his rank.

In the peerage of Scotland, when there are no courtesy titles involved, the heir to an earldom, and indeed any level of peerage, is styled &quot;Master of [X]&quot;, and successive sons as &quot;The Honourable [Firstname Surname]&quot;.

== List of earldoms ==

There are many earldoms, extant, extinct, dormant, abeyant, or forfeit, in the peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

==In fiction==

Earls have appeared in various works of fiction.

<text>The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a cabinet-level executive branch department of the U.S. federal government created to protect the health of the U.S. people and providing essential human services. Its motto is &quot;Improving the health, safety, and well-being of America&quot;. Before the separate federal Department of Education was created in 1979, it was called the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).

HHS is administered by the secretary of health and human services, who is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the United States Senate.

The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the uniformed service of the PHS, is led by the surgeon general who is responsible for addressing matters concerning public health as authorized by the secretary or by the assistant secretary for health in addition to his or her primary mission of administering the Commissioned Corps.

==History==

===Federal Security Agency===
The Federal Security Agency (FSA) was established on July 1, 1939, under the Reorganization Act of 1939, P.L. 76–19. The objective was to bring together in one agency all federal programs in the fields of health, education, and social security. The first Federal Security Administrator was Paul V. McNutt. The new agency originally consisted of the following major components: (1) Office of the Administrator, (2) Public Health Service (PHS), (3) Office of Education, (4) Civilian Conservation Corps, and (5) Social Security Board.

===Department of Health, Education, and Welfare===

The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) was created on April 11, 1953, when Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 became effective. HEW thus became the first new Cabinet-level department since the Department of Labor was created in 1913. The Reorganization Plan abolished the FSA and transferred all of its functions to the secretary of HEW and all components of the agency to the department. The first secretary of HEW was Oveta Culp Hobby, a native of Texas, who had served as commander of the Women&#x27;s Army Corps in World War II and was editor and publisher of the &quot;Houston Post&quot;. Sworn in on April 11, 1953, as secretary, she had been FSA administrator since January 21, 1953.

The six major program-operating components of the new department were the Public Health Service, the Office of Education, the Food and Drug Administration, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, and St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital. The department was also responsible for three federally aided corporations: Howard University, the American Printing House for the Blind, and the Columbia Institution for the Deaf (Gallaudet College since 1954).

===Department of Health &amp; Human Services===
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was renamed the Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) on October 17, 1979, when its education functions were transferred to the newly created United States Department of Education under the Department of Education Organization Act. HHS was left in charge of the Social Security Administration, agencies constituting the Public Health Service, and Family Support Administration.

In 1995, the Social Security Administration was removed from the Department of Health &amp; Human Services, and established as an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States government.

The 2010 United States federal budget established a reserve fund of more than $630 billion over 10 years to finance fundamental reform of the health care system.

== Organization ==
===Internal structure===
The Department of Health &amp; Human Services is led by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, a member of the United States Cabinet appointed by the President of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate. The secretary is assisted in managing the department by the Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is also appointed by the president. The secretary and deputy secretary are further assisted by seven assistant secretaries, who serve as top departmentals administrators.

As of January 20, 2018, this is the top level of the organizational chart. HHS provides further organizational details on its website.

Several agencies within HHS are components of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), as noted below.

===Office of Inspector General===
The Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) investigates criminal activity for HHS. The special agents who work for OIG have the same title series &quot;1811&quot; as other federal criminal investigators, such as the FBI, HSI, ATF, DEA and Secret Service. They receive their law enforcement training at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia. OIG Special Agents have special skills in investigating white collar crime related to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Organized crime has dominated the criminal activity relative to this type of fraud.

HHS-OIG investigates tens of millions of dollars in Medicare fraud each year. In addition, OIG will continue its coverage of all 50 states and the District of Columbia by its multi-agency task forces (PSOC Task Forces) that identify, investigate, and prosecute individuals who willfully avoid payment of their child support obligations under the Child Support Recovery Act.

HHS-OIG agents also provide protective services to the Secretary of HHS, and other department executives as necessary.

In 2002, the department released Healthy People 2010, a national strategic initiative for improving the health of Americans.

With the passage of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, and the Affordable Care Act of 2010, the Office of the Inspector General has taken an emboldened stance against healthcare-related non-compliance, most notably for violations of Law and the Anti-Kickback Statute.

In 2015, the OIG issued a fraud alert as a warning to hospitals and healthcare systems to monitor and comply with their physician compensation arrangements.

Recent years have seen dramatic increases in both the number and the amounts of Stark Law violation settlements, prompting healthcare experts to identify a need for automated solutions that manage physician arrangements by centralizing necessary information concerning physicianhospital integration. Contract management software companies such as Meditract provide options for health systems to organize and store physician contracts. Ludi Inc introduced DocTime Log®, an SaaS solution that specifically addresses this growing concern, automating physician time logging in compliance with contract terms to eliminate Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute violations.

According to a report released by the OIG in July 2019, more than 80 percent of the 4,563 U.S. hospice centers that provide care to Medicare beneficiaries surveyed from 2012 to 2016 have at least one deficiency and 20 percent have at least one &quot;serious deficiency&quot;.

From January 2020, Christi Grimm became the principal deputy inspector general. She assumed the duties of an acting inspector general because the inspector general post was empty. In April 2020, Grimm released a report which surveyed the state of hospitals in late March during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The hospitals reported &quot;severe shortages of testing supplies&quot;, &quot;frequently waiting 7 days or longer for test results&quot;, which extended the length of patient stays and strained resources, and &quot;widespread shortages of PPE&quot;. President Trump called the report &quot;wrong&quot; and questioned Grimm&#x27;s motives. Later he called the report &quot;Another Fake Dossier!&quot; In May 2020, Trump nominated Jason Weida to be the permanent inspector general, pending confirmation by the U.S. Senate. According to a department spokeswoman, Grimm will remain as principal deputy inspector general.

==Budget and finances==
The Department of Health and Human Services was authorized a budget for fiscal year 2020 of $1.293 trillion. The budget authorization is broken down as follows:

The FY2020 budget included a $1.276 billion budget decrease for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a $4.533 billion budget decrease for the National Institutes of Health. These budget cuts, along with other changes since 2019, comprised a total decrease of over $24 billion in revised discretionary budget authority across the entire Department of Health and Human Services for Fiscal Year 2020.

Additional details of the budgeted outlays, budget authority, and detailed budgets for other years, can be found at the HHS Budget website.

== Programs ==
The Department of Health &amp; Human Services administers 115 programs across its 11 operating divisions. The United States Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) aims to &quot;protect the health of all Americans and provide essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves.&quot; These federal programs consist of social service programs, civil rights and healthcare privacy programs, disaster preparedness programs, and health-related research. HHS offers a variety of social service programs geared toward persons with low income, disabilities, military families, and senior citizens. Healthcare rights are defined under HHS in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which protect patient&#x27;s privacy in regards to medical information, protects workers health insurance when unemployed, and sets guidelines surrounding some health insurance. HHS collaborates with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and Office of Emergency Management to prepare and respond to health emergencies. A broad array of health-related research is supported or completed under the HHS; secondarily under HHS, the Health Resources &amp; Service Administration houses data warehouses and makes health data available surrounding a multitude of topics. HHS also has vast offering of health-related resources and tools to help educate the public on health policies and pertinent population health information. Some examples of available resources include disease prevention, wellness, health insurance information, as well as links to healthcare providers and facilities, meaningful health-related materials, public health, and safety information.

Some highlights include:

* AI in health and social science research
* Preventing disease, including immunization services
* ARPA-H
* Assuring food and drug safety
* Medicare (health insurance for elderly and disabled Americans) and Medicaid (health insurance for low-income people)
* Health information technology
* Financial assistance and services for low-income families
* Improving maternal and infant health, including a Nurse Home Visitation to support first-time mothers
* Head Start (pre-school education and services)
* Faith-based and community initiatives
* Preventing child abuse and domestic violence
* Substance abuse treatment and prevention
* Services for older Americans, including home-delivered meals
* Comprehensive health services for Native Americans
* Assets for Independence
* Medical preparedness for emergencies, including potential terrorism
* Child support enforcement
=== The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ===
This program is to ensure the accountability of medical professionals to respect and carry out basic human health rights, under the act of the same name. In the United States, the government feels that it is essential for the American people to understand their civil duty and rights to all of their medical information. That includes health insurance policies or medical records from every doctor or emergency visit in one&#x27;s life. Through Health &amp; Human Services one can file a complaint that their HIPAA rights have been violated or a consultant will be able to decide if their rights were violated.

=== Social Services ===
This branch has everything to do with the social justice, wellness, and care of all people throughout the United States. This includes but is not limited to people who need government assistance, foster care, unaccompanied alien children, daycares (headstart included), adoption, senior citizens, and disability programs. Social services is one of (if not) the largest branch of programs underneath it that has a wide variety throughout the United States at a state and local level.

=== Prevention and Wellness ===
The prevention and wellness program&#x27;s main idea is to give the American people the ability to live the healthiest and best lifestyle physically that they can. They are the ones who deal with vaccines and immunizations, which fight from common diseases to deadly ones. The nutrition &amp; fitness program are the basics of healthy eating and regular exercise. Health screenings &amp; family health history are crucial in the knowledge of each individual&#x27;s health and body. A severely important one especially in today&#x27;s society is mental health and substance use where they help people with mental illness and drug abuse. Lastly, they help with environmental health where people are researching and studying how our environments both physical and metaphorical have short- and long-term effects on our health and wellness.

===Strengthening Communities Fund===
In June 2010, the Department of Health &amp; Human Services created the Strengthening Communities Fund as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The fund was appropriated $50 million to be given as grants to organizations in the United States that were engaged in Capacity Building programs. The grants were given to two different types of capacity builders:
* State, Local, and Tribal governments engaged in capacity building: grants will go to state local, and tribal governments to equip them with the capacity to more effectively partner with faith-based or non-faith-based nonprofit organizations. Capacity building in this program will involve education and outreach that catalyzes more involvement of nonprofit organizations in economic recovery and building up nonprofit organization&#x27;s abilities to tackle economic problems. State, Local, and Tribal governments can receive up to $250,000 in two-year grants
* Nonprofit Social Service Providers engaged in capacity building: they will make grants available to nonprofit organizations that can assist other nonprofit organizations in organizational development, program development, leadership, and evaluations. Nonprofits can receive up to $1 million in two-year grants

=== Biodefense ===
HHS plays a role in protecting the United States against bioterrorism events. In 2018, HHS released a new National Biodefense Strategy required by the passage of the 2016 Biodefense Strategy Act. The Biodefense Strategy required the implementation of a biodefense strategy after a 2015 Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense report found that the 2009 National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats was inadequate in protecting the U.S. The strategy adopted these five central recommendations: creating a single centralized approach to biodefense; implementing an interdisciplinary approach to biodefense that brings together policymakers, scientists, health experts, and academics; drawing up a comprehensive strategy to address human, plant, and animal health; creating a defense against global and domestic biological threats; and creating a proactive policy to combat the misuse and abuse of advanced biotechnology.

HHS also runs the Biodefense Steering Committee, which works with other federal agencies including the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Environmental Protection Agency. HHS specifically oversees Project BioShield, established in 2003 and operating since 2004, and its development and production of vaccines.

== Criticisms and controversies ==
In 2016, a published US Senate report revealed that several dozen unaccompanied children from Central America, some as young as 14 years old, were released from custody to traffickers where they were sexually assaulted, starved, or forced to work for little or no pay. The HHS sub agency Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) released approximately 90,000 unaccompanied children during 2013–2015 but did not track their whereabouts or properly screen families accepting these children.

To prevent similar episodes, the Homeland Security and Health &amp; Human Services Departments signed a memorandum of understanding in 2016 and agreed to establish joint procedures within one year for dealing with unaccompanied migrant children. As of 2018, they have failed to do so. Between October and December 2017, officials from ORR tried to contact 7,635 children and their sponsors. From these calls, officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight had run away, five had been removed from the United States and fifty-two had relocated to live with a nonsponsor. However, officials have lost track of 1,475 children. ORR claims it is not legally liable for the safety and status of the children once released from custody.

HHS is evidenced to be actively coercing and forcing bio-substances such as antipsychotics on migrating children without consent, and under questionable medical supervision. Medical professionals state that wrongly prescribed antipsychotics are especially dangerous for children, and can cause permanent psychological damage. Medical professionals also state DHS and HHS incarceration and separation policies are likewise causing irreparable mental harm to the children.

Children are also dying in HHS custody. The forced drugging, deaths, and disappearances of migrating Mexican and Central American children might be related to DHS falsely labeling them and their families as &#x27;terror threats&#x27; before HHS manages their incarcerations. Despite a federal court order, the DHS separation practices started by Obama and mandated by the Trump administration&#x27;s &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; policy have not been halted, and HHS has not stopped forcing drugs on the children it incarcerates.

In August 2022, the Office of the Inspector General for Health and Human Services reported that NIH had failed in its oversight of clinical trials, with slightly over half of sample trial results either being tardy for publication or remaining unpublished on ClinicalTrials.gov after several years from the stated completion dates.

===Freedom of Information Act processing performance===
In the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the DHHS ranked second to last, earning an F by scoring 57 out of a possible 100 points, largely due to a low score on its particular disclosure rules. It had deteriorated from a D− in 2013.

<text>A nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH or Ni–MH) is a type of rechargeable battery. The chemical reaction at the positive electrode is similar to that of the nickel–cadmium cell (NiCd), with both using nickel oxide hydroxide (NiOOH). However, the negative electrodes use a hydrogen-absorbing alloy instead of cadmium. NiMH batteries can have two to three times the capacity of NiCd batteries of the same size, with significantly higher energy density, although only about half that of lithium-ion batteries.

They are typically used as a substitute for similarly shaped non-rechargeable alkaline batteries, as they feature a slightly lower but generally compatible cell voltage and are less prone to leaking.

== History ==

Work on NiMH batteries began at the Battelle-Geneva Research Center following the technology&#x27;s invention in 1967. It was based on sintered Ti2Ni+TiNi+x alloys and NiOOH electrodes. Development was sponsored over nearly two decades by Daimler-Benz and by Volkswagen AG within Deutsche Automobilgesellschaft, now a subsidiary of Daimler AG. The batteries&#x27; specific energy reached 50 W·h/kg (180 kJ/kg), specific power up to 1000 W/kg and a life of 500 charge cycles (at 100% depth of discharge). Patent applications were filed in European countries (priority: Switzerland), the United States, and Japan. The patents transferred to Daimler-Benz.

Interest grew in the 1970s with the commercialisation of the nickel–hydrogen battery for satellite applications. Hydride technology promised an alternative, less bulky way to store the hydrogen. Research carried out by Philips Laboratories and France&#x27;s CNRS developed new high-energy hybrid alloys incorporating rare-earth metals for the negative electrode. However, these suffered from alloy instability in alkaline electrolyte and consequently insufficient cycle life. In 1987, Willems and Buschow demonstrated a successful battery based on this approach (using a mixture of La0.8Nd0.2Ni2.5Co2.4Si0.1), which kept 84% of its charge capacity after 4000 charge-discharge cycles. More economically viable alloys using mischmetal instead of lanthanum were soon developed. Modern NiMH cells were based on this design. The first consumer-grade NiMH cells became commercially available in 1989.

In 1998, Stanford Ovshinsky at Ovonic Battery Co., which had been working on MH-NiOOH batteries since mid-1980, improved the Ti–Ni alloy structure and composition and patented its innovations.

In 2008, more than two million hybrid cars worldwide were manufactured with NiMH batteries.

In the European Union due to its Battery Directive, nickel–metal hydride batteries replaced Ni–Cd batteries for portable consumer use.

About 22% of portable rechargeable batteries sold in Japan in 2010 were NiMH. In Switzerland in 2009, the equivalent statistic was approximately 60%. This percentage has fallen over time due to the increase in manufacture of lithium-ion batteries: in 2000, almost half of all portable rechargeable batteries sold in Japan were NiMH.

In 2015 BASF produced a modified microstructure that helped make NiMH batteries more durable, in turn allowing changes to the cell design that saved considerable weight, allowing the specific energy to reach 140 watt-hours per kilogram.

== Electrochemistry ==
The negative electrode reaction occurring in a NiMH cell is

: H2O + M + e− OH− + MH

On the positive electrode, nickel oxyhydroxide, NiO(OH), is formed:

: Ni(OH)2 + OH− NiO(OH) + H2O + e−

The reactions proceed left to right during charge and the opposite during discharge. The metal M in the negative electrode of a NiMH cell is an intermetallic compound. Many different compounds have been developed for this application, but those in current use fall into two classes. The most common is AB5, where A is a rare-earth mixture of lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, and B is nickel, cobalt, manganese, or aluminium. Some cells use higher-capacity negative electrode materials based on AB2 compounds, where A is titanium or vanadium, and B is zirconium or nickel, modified with chromium, cobalt, iron, or manganese.

NiMH cells have an alkaline electrolyte, usually potassium hydroxide. The positive electrode is nickel hydroxide, and the negative electrode is hydrogen in the form of an interstitial metal hydride. Hydrophilic polyolefin nonwovens are used for separation.

== Charge ==
When fast-charging, it is advisable to charge the NiMH cells with a smart battery charger to avoid overcharging, which can damage cells.

=== Trickle charging ===
The simplest of the safe charging methods is with a fixed low current, with or without a timer. Most manufacturers claim that overcharging is safe at very low currents, below 0.1 &quot;C&quot; (&quot;C&quot;/10) (where &quot;C&quot; is the current equivalent to the capacity of the battery divided by one hour). The Panasonic NiMH charging manual warns that overcharging for long enough can damage a battery and suggests limiting the total charging time to 10–20 hours.

Duracell further suggests that a trickle charge at &quot;C&quot;/300 can be used for batteries that must be kept in a fully charged state. Some chargers do this after the charge cycle, to offset natural self-discharge. A similar approach is suggested by Energizer, which indicates that self-catalysis can recombine gas formed at the electrodes for charge rates up to C/10. This leads to cell heating. The company recommends &quot;C&quot;/30 or &quot;C&quot;/40 for indefinite applications where long life is important. This is the approach taken in emergency lighting applications, where the design remains essentially the same as in older NiCd units, except for an increase in the trickle-charging resistor value.

Panasonic&#x27;s handbook recommends that NiMH batteries on standby be charged by a lower duty cycle approach, where a pulse of a higher current is used whenever the battery&#x27;s voltage drops below 1.3 V. This can extend battery life and use less energy.

=== Δ&quot;V&quot; charging method ===
To prevent cell damage, fast chargers must terminate their charge cycle before overcharging occurs. One method is to monitor the change of voltage with time. When the battery is fully charged, the voltage across its terminals drops slightly. The charger can detect this and stop charging. This method is often used with nickel–cadmium cells, which display a large voltage drop at full charge. However, the voltage drop is much less pronounced for NiMH and can be non-existent at low charge rates, which can make the approach unreliable.

Another option is to monitor the change of voltage with respect to time and stop when this becomes zero, but this risks premature cutoffs. With this method, a much higher charging rate can be used than with a trickle charge, up to 1 &quot;C&quot;. At this charge rate, Panasonic recommends to terminate charging when the voltage drops 5–10 mV per cell from the peak voltage. Since this method measures the voltage across the battery, a constant-current (rather than a constant-voltage) charging circuit is used.

=== Δ&quot;T&quot; charging method ===
The temperature-change method is similar in principle to the Δ&quot;V&quot; method. Because the charging voltage is nearly constant, constant-current charging delivers energy at a near-constant rate. When the cell is not fully charged, most of this energy is converted to chemical energy. However, when the cell reaches full charge, most of the charging energy is converted to heat. This increases the rate of change of battery temperature, which can be detected by a sensor such as a thermistor. Both Panasonic and Duracell suggest a maximal rate of temperature increase of 1 °C per minute. Using a temperature sensor allows an absolute temperature cutoff, which Duracell suggests at 60 °C. With both the Δ&quot;T&quot; and the Δ&quot;V&quot; charging methods, both manufacturers recommend a further period of trickle charging to follow the initial rapid charge.

=== Safety ===
A resettable fuse in series with the cell, particularly of the bimetallic strip type, increases safety. This fuse opens if either the current or the temperature gets too high.

Modern NiMH cells contain catalysts to handle gases produced by over-charging:

: &lt;chem&gt;2H2{} + O2 -&gt;[\text{catalyst}] 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

However, this only works with overcharging currents of up to 0.1 &quot;C&quot; (that is, nominal capacity divided by ten hours). This reaction causes batteries to heat, ending the charging process.

A method for very rapid charging called in-cell charge control involves an internal pressure switch in the cell, which disconnects the charging current in the event of overpressure.

One inherent risk with NiMH chemistry is that overcharging causes hydrogen gas to form, potentially rupturing the cell. Therefore, cells have a vent to release the gas in the event of serious overcharging.

NiMH batteries are made of environmentally friendly materials. The batteries contain only mildly toxic substances and are recyclable.

===Loss of capacity===
Voltage depression (often mistakenly attributed to the memory effect) from repeated partial discharge can occur, but is reversible with a few full discharge/charge cycles.

== Discharge ==
A fully charged cell supplies an average 1.25 V/cell during discharge, declining to about 1.0–1.1 V/cell (further discharge may cause permanent damage in the case of multi-cell packs, due to polarity reversal of the weakest cell). Under a light load (0.5 amperes), the starting voltage of a freshly charged AA NiMH cell in good condition is about 1.4 volts.

=== Over-discharge ===
Complete discharge of multi-cell packs can cause reverse polarity in one or more cells, which can permanently damage them. This situation can occur in the common arrangement of four AA cells in series, where one cell completely discharges before the others due to small differences in capacity among the cells. When this happens, the good cells start to drive the discharged cell into reverse polarity (i.e. positive anode and negative cathode). Some cameras, GPS receivers and PDAs detect the safe end-of-discharge voltage of the series cells and perform an auto-shutdown, but devices such as flashlights and some toys do not.

Irreversible damage from polarity reversal is a particular danger, even when a low voltage-threshold cutout is employed, when the cells vary in temperature. This is because capacity significantly declines as the cells are cooled. This results in a lower voltage under load of the colder cells.

=== Self-discharge ===
Historically, NiMH cells have had a somewhat higher self-discharge rate (equivalent to internal leakage) than NiCd cells. The self-discharge rate varies greatly with temperature, where lower storage temperature leads to slower discharge and longer battery life. The self-discharge is on the first day and stabilizes around per day at room temperature. But at it is approximately three times as high.

=== Low self-discharge === 
The low–self-discharge nickel–metal hydride battery (LSD NiMH) has a significantly lower rate of self-discharge. The innovation was introduced in 2005 by Sanyo, branded Eneloop. By using improvements to electrode separator, positive electrode, and other components, manufacturers claim the cells retain 70–85% of their capacity when stored for one year at , compared to about half for normal NiMH batteries. They are otherwise similar to standard NiMH batteries, and can be charged in standard NiMH chargers. These cells are marketed as &quot;hybrid&quot;, &quot;ready-to-use&quot; or &quot;pre-charged&quot; rechargeables. Retention of charge depends in large part on the battery&#x27;s leakage resistance (the higher the better), and on its physical size and charge capacity.

Separators keep the two electrodes apart to slow electrical discharge while allowing the transport of ionic charge carriers that close the circuit during the passage of current. High-quality separators are critical for battery performance.

The self-discharge rate depends upon separator thickness; thicker separators reduce self-discharge, but also reduce capacity as they leave less space for active components, and thin separators lead to higher self-discharge. Some batteries may have overcome this tradeoff by using more precisely manufactured thin separators, and a sulfonated polyolefin separator, an improvement over the hydrophilic polyolefin based on ethylene vinyl alcohol.

Low-self-discharge cells have somewhat lower capacity than otherwise equivalent NiMH cells because of the larger volume of the separator. The highest-capacity low-self-discharge AA cells have 2500 mAh capacity, compared to 2700 mAh for high-capacity AA NiMH cells.

Common methods to improve self-discharge include: use of a sulfonated
separator (causing removal of N-containing compounds), use of an acrylic acid
grafted PP separator (causing reduction in Al- and Mn-debris formation in separator), removal of Co and Mn in A2B7 MH alloy, (causing reduction in debris formation in separator), increase of the amount of electrolyte (causing reduction in the hydrogen diffusion in electrolyte), removal of Cu-containing components (causing reduction in micro-short), PTFE coating on positive electrode (causing suppression of reaction between NiOOH and H2), CMC solution dipping (causing suppression of oxygen evolution), micro-encapsulation of Cu on MH alloy (causing decrease in H2 released from MH alloy), Ni–B alloy coating on MH alloy (causing formation of a protection layer), alkaline treatment of negative electrode (causing reduction of leach-out of Mn and Al), addition of LiOH and NaOH into electrolyte (causing reduction in electrolyte
corrosion capabilities), and addition of Al2(SO4)3 into electrolyte (causing reduction in MH alloy corrosion). Most of these improvements have no or negligible effect on cost; some increase cost modestly.

== Compared to other battery types ==
===Alkaline batteries===
NiMH cells are often used in digital cameras and other high-drain devices, where over the duration of single-charge use they outperform primary (such as alkaline) batteries.

NiMH cells are advantageous for high-current-drain applications compared to alkaline batteries, largely due to their lower internal resistance. Typical alkaline AA-size batteries, which offer approximately 2.6 Ah capacity at low current demand (25 mA), provide only 1.3 Ah capacity with a 500 mA load. Digital cameras with LCDs and flashlights can draw over 1 A, quickly depleting them. NiMH cells can deliver these current levels without similar loss of capacity.

Devices that were designed to operate using primary alkaline chemistry (or zinc-carbon/chloride) cells may not function with NiMH cells. However, most devices compensate for the voltage drop of an alkaline battery as it discharges down to about 1 volt. Low internal resistance allows NiMH cells to deliver a nearly constant voltage until they are almost completely discharged. Thus battery-level indicators designed to read alkaline cells overstate the remaining charge when used with NiMH cells, as the voltage of alkaline cells decreases steadily during most of the discharge cycle.

===Lithium-ion batteries===
Lithium-ion batteries can deliver extremely high power and have a higher specific energy than nickel–metal hydride batteries, but they were originally significantly more expensive. The cost of lithium batteries fell drastically during the 2010s and many small consumer devices now have non-consumer-replaceable lithium batteries as a result. 
Lithium batteries produce a higher voltage (3.2–3.7 V nominal), and are thus not a drop-in replacement for AA (alkaline or NiMh) batteries without circuitry to reduce voltage. Although a single lithium cell will typically provide ideal power to replace 3 NiMH cells, the form factor means that the device still needs modification.

===Lead batteries===
NiMH batteries can easily be made smaller and lighter than lead-acid batteries and have completely replaced them in small devices. However, lead-acid batteries can deliver huge current at low cost, making lead-acid batteries more suitable for starter motors in combustion vehicles.

, nickel–metal hydride batteries constituted three percent of the battery market.

== Applications ==

=== Consumer electronics ===
NiMH batteries have replaced NiCd for many roles, notably small rechargeable batteries. NiMH batteries are commonly available in AA (penlight-size) batteries. These have nominal charge capacities (&quot;C&quot;) of 1.1–2.8 Ah at 1.2 V, measured at the rate that discharges the cell in 5 hours. Useful discharge capacity is a decreasing function of the discharge rate, but up to a rate of around 1×&quot;C&quot; (full discharge in 1 hour), it does not differ significantly from the nominal capacity. NiMH batteries nominally operate at 1.2 V per cell, somewhat lower than conventional 1.5 V cells, but can operate many devices designed for that voltage.

=== Electric vehicles ===
NiMH batteries were frequently used in prior-generation electric and hybrid-electric vehicles; as of 2020 they have been superseded almost entirely by lithium-ion batteries in all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, but they remain in use in some hybrid vehicles (2020 Toyota Highlander, for example). Prior all-electric plug-in vehicles included the General Motors EV1, first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV, Honda EV Plus, Ford Ranger EV and Vectrix scooter. Every first generation hybrid vehicle used NIMH batteries, most notably the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, as well as later models including the Ford Escape Hybrid, Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid and Honda Civic Hybrid also use them.

==== Patent issues ====
Stanford R. Ovshinsky invented and patented a popular improvement of the NiMH battery and founded Ovonic Battery Company in 1982. General Motors purchased Ovonics&#x27; patent in 1994. By the late 1990s, NiMH batteries were being used successfully in many fully electric vehicles, such as the General Motors EV1 and Dodge Caravan EPIC minivan.

This generation of electric cars, although successful, was abruptly pulled off the market.

In October 2000, the patent was sold to Texaco, and a week later Texaco was acquired by Chevron. Chevron&#x27;s Cobasys subsidiary provides these batteries only to large OEM orders. General Motors shut down production of the EV1, citing lack of battery availability as a chief obstacle. Cobasys control of NiMH batteries created a patent encumbrance for large automotive NiMH batteries.

<doc id="58253" wikidata="Q209726" url="?curid=58253" title="Marquess">
<text>A marquess (; ) is a nobleman of high hereditary rank in various European peerages and in those of some of their former colonies. The German-language equivalent is Markgraf (margrave). A woman with the rank of a marquess or the wife (or widow) of a marquess is a marchioness () or marquise (). These titles are also used to translate equivalent Asian styles, as in Imperial China and Imperial Japan.
==Etymology==

The word &quot;marquess&quot; entered the English language from the Old French (&quot;ruler of a border area&quot;) in the late 13th or early 14th century. The French word was derived from (&quot;frontier&quot;), itself descended from the Middle Latin (&quot;frontier&quot;), from which the modern English word &quot;march&quot; also descends. The distinction between governors of frontier territories and interior territories was made as early as the founding of the Roman Empire when some provinces were set aside for administration by the senate and more unpacified or vulnerable provinces were administered by the emperor. The titles &quot;duke&quot; and &quot;count&quot; were similarly distinguished as ranks in the Byzantine Empire, with (literally, &quot;leader&quot;) being used for a provincial military governor and the rank of (literally &quot;companion&quot;, that is, of the Emperor) given to the leader of an active army along the frontier.

==Belgium==
The title of marquess in Belgium predates the French Revolution and still exists today. See and .

==Spain==
In Spain, the rank of Marquess/Marchioness (/) still exists. One hundred forty-two of them are Spanish grandees. Normally a is addressed as &quot;The Most Illustrious Lord&quot; (), or if he/she is a grandee as &quot;The Most Excellent Lord&quot; (). Examples include the Marquess of Carpio, Grandee of Spain.

==United Kingdom==

In Great Britain and historically in Ireland, a marquess ranks below a duke and above an earl. A woman with the rank of a marquess, or the wife of a marquess, is a marchioness . The dignity, rank, or position of the title is a marquisate or marquessate.

The honorific prefix &quot;The Most Honourable&quot; precedes the name of a marquess or marchioness of the United Kingdom.

In Great Britain, and historically in Ireland, the spelling of this title is marquess. In Scotland, the French spelling marquis is sometimes used. 

The theoretical distinction between a marquess and other titles has, since the Middle Ages, faded into obscurity. In times past, the distinction between a count and a marquess was that the land of a marquess, called a march, was on the border of the country, while a count&#x27;s land, called a county, often was not. As a result of this, a marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbours and was thus more important and ranked higher than a count. The title is ranked below that of a duke, which was often largely restricted to the royal family.

The rank of marquess was a relatively late introduction to the British peerage: no marcher lords had the rank of marquess, though some were earls. On the evening of the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne explained to her why (from her journals):
I spoke to [Lord Melbourne] about the numbers of Peers present at the Coronation, &amp; he said it was quite unprecedented. I observed that there were very few Viscounts, to which he replied &quot;There are very few Viscounts,&quot; that they were an old sort of title &amp; not really English; that they came from Vice-Comites; that Dukes &amp; Barons were the only real English titles; – that Marquises were likewise not English, &amp; that people were mere made Marquises, when it was not wished that they should be made Dukes.

==Analogous non-Western titles==

Like other major Western noble titles, marquess (or marquis) is sometimes used to translate certain titles from non-Western languages with their own traditions, even though they are, as a rule, historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered &quot;equivalent&quot; in relative rank.

This is the case with: 
* In ancient China, 侯 (&quot;hóu&quot;) a noble rank created by King Wu of Zhou for rulers of newly conquered regions, and is generally translated as marquess or marquis. In imperial China, 侯 (&quot;hóu&quot;) is generally, but not always, a middle-to-high ranking hereditary nobility title. Its exact rank varies greatly from dynasty to dynasty, and even within a dynasty. It is often created with different sub-ranks, with (&quot;liè hóu&quot;, Ranged Marquis) generally the highest.
* In Meiji Japan, 侯爵 (&quot;kōshaku&quot;), a hereditary peerage (&quot;kazoku&quot;) rank, was introduced in 1884, granting a hereditary seat in the upper house of the imperial diet just as a British peerage did (until the House of Lords Act 1999), with the ranks usually rendered as baron, viscount, count, marquis and duke/prince.
* In Korea, the title of 현후 (縣侯; &quot;hyeonhu&quot;), the meaning of which is &quot;marquess of district&quot;, existed for the hereditary nobility in the Goryeo dynasty. It was equivalent to the upper fifth rank of nine bureaucratic orders, and was in the third rank of six nobility orders. The title of Buwongun, could be received only Father in law of King or The Vassals who dedicate Notably to create New kingdom is also same as Marquess. In the Joseon dynasty, there was no title equivalent to marquess.
* In Maritime Southeast Asia, &quot;temenggong&quot; (or &quot;tumenggung&quot;) is a title used by Islamic dynasties such as Mataram Sultanate and Johor to designate a noble ruled over a frontier area or district, or to a chief of public security. Tumenggung ranks below Bendahara or vizier.
* In Vietnam, &quot;hầu&quot; () was a senior title of hereditary nobility, equivalent to marquis, for male members of the imperial clan, ranking under &quot;hoàng đế&quot; (皇帝)(emperor), &quot;vương&quot; (王)(king/prince), &quot;quốc công&quot; (國公)(grand duke/duke of the nation), &quot;quận công&quot; (郡公)(provincial duke) and &quot;công&quot; (公)(duke, rather like a German Fürst), and above &quot;bá&quot; (伯)(count), &quot;tử&quot; (子)(viscount) and &quot;nam&quot; (男)(baron).

==In fiction==

Marquesses and marchionesses have occasionally appeared in works of fiction.

<text>A Peerage is a form of crown distinction, with Peerages in the United Kingdom comprising both hereditary and lifetime titled appointments of various ranks, which form both a constituent part of the legislative process and the British honours system within the framework of the Constitution of the United Kingdom.

The peerage forms the highest rung of what is termed the &quot;British nobility&quot;. The term &quot;peerage&quot; can be used both collectively to refer to this entire body of titled nobility (or a subdivision thereof), and individually to refer to a specific title (modern English language-style using an initial capital in the latter case but not the former). British peerage title holders are termed peers of the Realm. &quot;Lord&quot; is used as a generic term to denote members of the peerage, however individuals who use the appellation &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; are not always necessarily peers (for example some judicial, ecclesiastic and others are often accorded the appellation &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; as a form of courtesy title as a product of their office). 
The British monarch is considered the fount of honour and is notionally the only person who can grant peerages, though there are many conventions about how this power is used, especially at the request of the British government.

The peerage&#x27;s fundamental roles are ones of law making and governance, with peers being eligible (although formerly &quot;entitled&quot;) to a seat in the House of Lords and having eligibility to serve in a ministerial role in the government if invited to do so by the monarch, or more conventionally in the modern era, by the prime minister.

Until the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009, the peerage also formed a constituent part of the British judicial system, via the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.

The peerage also has a ceremonial aspect, and serves a role as a system of honour or award, with the granting of a peerage title forming the highest rung of the modern British honours system.

Within the United Kingdom, due to the hereditary nature of most peerage titles historically, five peerage divisions currently co-exist, namely:
* The Peerage of England – titles created by the kings and queens of England before the Acts of Union in 1707.
* The Peerage of Scotland – titles created by the kings and queens of Scotland before 1707.
* The Peerage of Great Britain – titles created for the Kingdom of Great Britain between 1707 and 1801.
* The Peerage of Ireland – titles created for the Kingdom of Ireland before the Acts of Union in 1801, and some titles created later.
* The Peerage of the United Kingdom – most titles created since 1801 to the present.

== Background ==

===Creation===
All peerages are created by the British monarch. The monarch, as the fount of honour, cannot hold a British peerage themselves. However, the monarch, in addition to their title of &#x27;King&#x27; or &#x27;Queen&#x27;, whether male or female, is informally accorded the style of &#x27;Duke of Lancaster&#x27; (a title linked to the historic Duchy of Lancaster, which became the private estate of the British sovereign when the holder, Henry IV of England, ascended the throne in 1399). Likewise in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man (which are not parts of the United Kingdom, but possessions of the British Crown) the informal titles Duke of Normandy (a title associated with William the Conqueror prior to his ascension to the throne in 1066) and Lord of Mann (the title acquired with the Crown purchase of the Isle of Man under George III in 1765) are used respectively.

All British subjects who were neither Royal nor Peers of the Realm were previously termed &quot;commoners&quot;, regardless of ancestry, wealth or other social factors. Thus, all members of a peer&#x27;s family, with the exception of their wife or unremarried widow, are (technically) commoners too; the British system therefore differs fundamentally from continental European versions, where entire families, rather than individuals, were ennobled. This idea that status as a &#x27;commoner&#x27; is based on title rather than bloodline correspondingly means for example that Princess Anne, who enjoys royal status as the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, opted for her children (Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall) to be technically commoners (though functionally part of the untitled nobility) despite their being grandchildren of the then sovereign, when Anne and her husband, Mark Philips, declined the offer of peerage titles. Where children of peers use titles, these are accorded by courtesy, and they do not hold a peerage themselves. For example, the Duke of Norfolk holds other peerage titles including the Earl of Arundel and Baron Maltravers. A hypothetical eldest son of the Duke of Norfolk can therefore be styled by courtesy as &quot;Earl of Arundel&quot; (&quot;the&quot; does not precede it, as this would indicate a substantive title). In this example, only the Duke of Norfolk is actually a peer; his son is not.

===Division and rank===

Most peerages since 1801, and all subsequent peerages from 1898, are created within the division of the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Hereditary peerages are still extant in the other divisions: the Peerage of England, the Peerage of Scotland, the Peerage of Great Britain and the Peerage of Ireland.

Since 2009 almost all life peerages are created, by convention, at the rank of baron, the sole exception being the royal life peerage of the Dukedom of Edinburgh in 2023. The reason for this is that the Life Peerages Act 1958 restricts the issuing of writs of summons to life peers (entitling the peer to sit in the House of Lords) to those created at the rank of baron only. While peerages remain part of the honours system, the main reason for creating new peers is for them to hold a seat in the House of Lords. A government could theoretically support the creation of a life peerage at a more senior rank as an honour for someone who displayed particularly meritorious service, who did not want to enter parliament, but so far no government has done so.

===Entitlement and Heritability===

All honours, including peerages, are granted at the discretion of the monarch as the fount of honour (though functionally and mostly on the advice of the government); there is, therefore, no entitlement to be granted a peerage. However, historic precedent means some individuals are granted peerages by convention. For example, since the Wars of the Three Kingdoms it has been convention for a retiring speaker of the House of Commons to be granted a hereditary viscountcy; however, the last to receive the honour was in 1983, and the convention is now accepted to have changed to a life peerage at the rank of baron instead. British prime ministers are also offered a peerage by convention when leaving office. This was previously a hereditary earldom. However, the last prime minister to receive this honour was Harold Macmillan in 1984. When she resigned in 1990 Margaret Thatcher, as the first female prime minister, was not offered a hereditary earldom or any other peerage, but instead a baronetcy (a hereditary knighthood and not a peerage) was awarded to her husband Denis Thatcher (this was the last non-royal hereditary honour of any variety created in the UK to date). Thatcher was later given a life peerage in her own right in 1992. The most recent prime minister to receive a peerage was Theresa May, who was given a life peerage in 2024.

Most peerage nominations are &#x27;political peers&#x27; or &#x27;working peers&#x27;, nominated by the prime minister of the governing party, or by other party leaders to ‘top up’ each of the party groups’ strengths and on the expectation that they will attend parliament regularly and take on frontbench work. However, since 2001 any member of the public can make a nomination to the House of Lords Appointment Commission, to nominate someone to sit with the &quot;cross bench&quot; peers, as a non-party political peerage - sometimes called &#x27;people&#x27;s peers&#x27;. As of 2023, since 2001 67 &#x27;people&#x27;s peers&#x27; have been appointed.

Historically monarchs sold peerage titles under limited circumstances. This was often done to raise funds. For example, in the early Stuart period, King James I sold peerages, adding sixty-two peers to a body that had included just fifty-nine members at the commencement of his reign. Some governments through history also sold peerages to fund government activities, or more controversially, party activities. The selling of peerages by a government was made illegal in 1925 with the &quot;Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925&quot;. The act was the result of the administration of David Lloyd George selling a high number of controversial peerages. The Blair administration was later accused of trying to skirt this law in 2006 in the so called &quot;Cash-for-Honours scandal&quot;, as was an aide of Prince Charles in the 2021 Cash-for-Favours scandal. Unlike the feudal titles they replaced, peerages are not a form of property and cannot be transferred, bought, or sold by the title holder.

The exact terms of the peerage are set out in the letters patent. All peerages are strictly personal and for life. However, historic peerages are often heritable, primarily by agnatic primogeniture with some exceptions of male-preference cognatic primogeniture. For most of their history, hereditary peerages were the norm. Today, the only new hereditary peerages granted are, by convention, to members of the royal family. The last non-royal awardees of hereditary titles were in the Thatcher era. Since then, ruling parties have instead exclusively created life peers and refrained from recommending any others to be elevated to a hereditary peerage, although this is simply present convention and there is nothing preventing future governments from doing so.

===Confirmation process===

The government of the United Kingdom makes recommendations to the sovereign concerning who should be elevated to the peerage, after external vetting by the House of Lords Appointments Commission for those peers who will be sitting in the House of Lords (which is now by convention almost all new creations, with the exception of royal peerages).

It is unclear in the present day whether the monarch would move to directly block a recommendation or a conventional ascension to the peerage, though they are constitutionally entitled to do so. It was reported in 2023 that members of the British security services had contacted Queen Elizabeth II to request she intervene and block the peerage of Evgeny Lebedev who had been nominated by then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Some media outlets have reported personal interventions with other honours: For example, former prime ministers are also by convention knighted, being raised to the Order of the Garter or the Order of the Thistle. However it was alleged in 2020 that due to a personal reluctance by Queen Elizabeth II to award the Garter to Tony Blair other living prime ministers would not be raised either. Tony Blair was later knighted by Queen Elizabeth II as a Knight Companion of the Garter in 2022.

Like all Crown honours, peerages are affirmed by letters patent affixed with the Great Seal of the Realm. In addition to letters patent, peers who are to sit in Parliament are issued a Writ of summons. The Writ of Summons calls the member to the House. A new writ is issued for every member at the beginning of each Parliament (after a general election). A writ accompanies the letters patent for new members. The honour will also be recorded in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

Honours, including peerages, are usually awarded at new year and on the monarch&#x27;s official birthday. They can also be awarded as part of a Prime Minister&#x27;s resignation, or upon the dissolution of a Parliament. Monarchs may also make new peers upon their coronation, jubilee or upon the demise of the previous monarch. There are also &quot;ad hoc&quot; announcements and &quot;Special Honours&quot;, issued at any time throughout the year at the pleasure of the monarch. This might be done to allow someone to serve in cabinet, or as an immediate reward for exemplary service.

Recipients of new peerages are typically announced via the Crown Honours Lists. Formerly, new peers were presented with an investiture ceremony, but this has not taken place since 1621 (investiture ceremonies for other honours are mostly managed by the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood). New peers serving in parliament do receive an introduction ceremony at the House of Lords.

All peerages are recorded on the Roll of the Peerage maintained by the Crown Office within the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ministry of Justice, and published by the College of Arms. The Secretary of State for Justice in their role as Lord Chancellor is the keeper of the Peerage Roll, and their duties in that regard are daily discharged by a Registrar of the Peerage and a Deputy Registrar, who work within the Crown Office under the supervision of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. Succession claims to existing hereditary peerages are regulated by the House of Lords Committee for Privileges and Conduct and administered by the Crown Office.

===Declining, disclaiming, and revocation===

Peerages can be declined by prospective recipients, and often have been throughout history for various different reasons. For instance, Winston Churchill declined the Dukedom of London so he could continue to sit in the House of Commons.

Since the &quot;House of Lords Reform Act 2014&quot;, peers may resign from the House of Lords, whilst keeping their title and style.

Though there is no mechanism for life peers to fully disclaim their peerage, hereditary peers may fully disclaim their peerage for their lifetime under the &quot;Peerage Act 1963&quot;. The peerage remains extant until the death of the peer who had made the disclaimer, when it descends to his or her heir in the usual manner.

The Crown does not have the power to cancel or revoke a peerage once it has been created. A peerage can only be removed from an individual by an act of parliament, an example of such being the &quot;Titles Deprivation Act 1917&quot;.

==Constitutional Functions==

===Legislative function===
Any peer who receives a writ of summons (which is in practice all life Peers bar Royal Peers, and some hereditary peers) may sit in the House of Lords as the Lords Temporal. They sit alongside the Lords Spiritual, who do not hold peerages, but are bishops of the Church of England. Labour, elected to power in 1997, sought to remove all of the seats in the House of Lords reserved for hereditary peers via the &quot;House of Lords Act 1999&quot;, but then Prime Minister Tony Blair relented by allowing 92 members to remain. 90 of these hereditary peers are elected to the House of Lords from within their own populace, while the other two sit &quot;ex officio&quot; holding the hereditary constitutional offices of Earl Marshal and the Lord Great Chamberlain.

Since the &quot;Parliament Act 1911&quot; and &quot;Parliament Act 1949&quot; the House of Lords&#x27; purpose is now that of a revising legislative chamber, scrutinising and potentially changing proposed Parliamentary Bills before their enactment. Its membership for the most part comprises life peers, created under the &quot;Life Peerages Act 1958&quot;, which includes those who can add value in specific areas of expertise in parliamentary debates, as well as former MPs and other political appointees from respective political parties. Those who do not sit with a political party, may sit in the house as a so called Crossbencher. Prior to July 2006 the Lord Chancellor – one of the Great Officers of State and government minister – served as the presiding officer of the peers in the House of Lords. Were a person not a peer to be appointed to the office of Lord Chancellor, they would traditionally be raised to the peerage upon appointment, though a scarcely used provision was made in 1539 for appointees who are great officers of state but not peers to sit in between the benches in the House, meaning commoners could execute the role without the need for elevation to the peerage. Since 2006 however, in an effort to separate powers, the role of presiding officer has been fulfilled by the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords elected by the peers from amongst their own number. The Lord Chancellor retained their role as a government minister however, and in June 2007 Jack Straw was the first commoner to be appointed as Lord Chancellor since 1587.
As the upper chamber, in contrast to the House of Commons, where proceedings are controlled by the speaker, proceedings in the Lords are controlled by peers themselves, under the rules set out in the Standing Orders. The Leader of the House of Lords has the responsibility of reminding the House of these rules and facilitating the Lords&#x27; self-regulation, though any member may draw attention to breaches of order or failure to observe customs. The Leader is often called upon to advise on procedures and points of order. However, neither the Lord Speaker nor the Leader of the House has the power to rule on points of order or to intervene during an inappropriate speech.

Parties within the House of Lords have whips, however Cross Bench peers elect from among themselves a Cross-bench Convenor for administrative purposes, and to keep them up to date with the business of the House.

===Executive function===
Peers in the House of Lords can serve in the British government, when invited to do so, as ministers including within the Great Offices of State (for example Lord Cameron who served as Foreign Secretary in the Premiership of Rishi Sunak). The only consistent role for a peer in the cabinet is that of Leader of the House of Lords, who must be a member of the House of Lords by nature of the appointment.

Historically the Lord Chancellor was by convention a peer, and a member of the cabinet (in addition to serving a judicial and legislative role). The ministerial department of the lord chancellor was known as the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office between 1885 and 1971, and the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department between 1971 and 2003. In 2003 the department was renamed the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and the lord chancellor was appointed Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. In 2007 the department became the Ministry of Justice and in June 2007 Jack Straw was the first commoner to be appointed as Lord Chancellor since 1587.

Peers can even serve as prime minister, though this is no longer convention, and the last to do so was the 14th Earl of Home in 1963, who disclaimed his peerage within a few days of being appointed as prime minister to fight a by-election to sit in the Commons.

Peers in the House of Lords are often appointed by the sovereign, on the advice of the government, to serve as a Privy Counsellor. The Privy Council is a formal body of advisers to the monarch, on matters such as the issuing of royal charters. Peers can serve as Lords Commissioners when appointed (privy councillors appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom to exercise, on his or her behalf, certain functions relating to Parliament which would otherwise require the monarch&#x27;s attendance at the Palace of Westminster).

In theory all peers, life and hereditary, are also prospective members of the &quot;Magnum Concilium&quot; regardless of whether they sit in the House of Lords. This is a council summoned for nobles to discuss the affairs of the country with the monarch; however, it has not been convened since 1640, though nothing prevents it from being assembled in the future.

Peers can also be appointed as Lords-in-waiting where they may be called upon periodically to represent the sovereign; for example, one of their number is regularly called upon to greet visiting heads of state on arrival at the start of a state visit.

Prior to the &quot;Regency Act of 1937&quot;, peers serving as Lord Chancellor, or in other senior political roles, could also be delegated royal functions to serve as Counsellors of State; however, this is now reserved to the monarch&#x27;s spouse and the members of the Royal Family in the immediate line of succession.

===Judicial function===
Until 2009 the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords served as the highest appellate court within the United Kingdom&#x27;s legal system. The &quot;Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876&quot; allowed for the appointment of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary – judges meeting specific criteria made peers for life – who formed the main body of the committee. On 1 October 2009, the &quot;Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876&quot; was repealed, owing to the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The House of Lords thus lost its judicial functions. At the time of creation, the 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (the Law Lords) became the first wave of justices to the Supreme Court but were simultaneously disqualified from sitting or voting in the House of Lords until they retired from the court. Judges appointed to the new Supreme Court are not automatically made peers, but those who have not previously been independently granted a peerage, are entitled to use a judicial courtesy title of &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot;, with a territorial designation, for their remainder of their lives. In addition to serving as Presiding Officer of the Peers in the Lords, the Lord Chancellor also served as the head of the English and Welsh judiciary and a &quot;de facto&quot; &#x27;Justice Minister&#x27;. The judicial function of the Lord Chancellor was removed with the &quot;Constitutional Reform Act 2005&quot;, and the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales became the new head of the judiciary, while the former Lord Chancellor&#x27;s ministry/Department for Constitutional Affairs was merged into the newly created Ministry of Justice in May 2007. Since then all Lord Chancellors have also held the office of Minister of Justice (in much the same way all First Lords of the Treasury hold the office of Prime Minister). In 2012 Chris Grayling would be the first non-lawyer to serve as Lord Chancellor for at least 440 years. As the Head of the judiciary in England and Wales, the Lord Chancellor also served as a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; however, the last lord chancellor to preside as a judge of this court was Lord Irvine of Lairg (in office 1997–2003). This function was also removed from the Lord Chancellor following the &quot;Constitutional Reform Act 2005&quot;.

The Earl Marshal is the only peer in England and Wales to retain a judicial function by right of office, as the sole judge of the High Court of Chivalry a civil law court with jurisdiction over matters of heraldry in England and Wales, though if not a professional lawyer, he normally appoints a professional lawyer as his lieutenant or surrogate. In Scotland the Duke of Hamilton is a hereditary assessor at the Court of the Lord Lyon, a standing court of law which regulates heraldry in Scotland.

===Ceremonial function===

The Lord Great Chamberlain is entrusted by the Sovereign with custody of the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British Parliament, and serves as his or her representative therein. They have jurisdiction within all areas of the palace excluding the House of Lords and House of Commons directly. The position is a hereditary one, held since 1780 in gross between three families descending from the 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Under an agreement made in 1912, the right to exercise the office for a given reign rotates among the three families (of the then three joint office holders) in proportion to the fraction of the office held. At any one time, no single person actually exercises the office of Lord Great Chamberlain. The various individuals who hold fractions of the office are properly each &quot;Joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain&quot;. Their modern role is to serve as a &quot;de facto&quot; director of ceremonies for the Palace of Westminster. Though the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, the Act provided that a hereditary peer exercising the office of Lord Great Chamberlain be exempt from such a rule, in order to perform ceremonial functions. They help to organise the State Opening of Parliament and direct Black Rod to summon members of the House of Commons to attend the House of Lords for the speech from the throne.

The Lord Great Chamberlain and the Earl Marshal each have a role in the Coronation of the British monarch. Other invited peers also have a role in the coronation. Peers wear coronation robes and coronets during a specific part of the ceremony. However in 2023 peers were asked not to wear their coronets for the coronation of Charles III.

Peers who are also Privy Councillors form part of the Accession Council upon the death of a monarch to make formal proclamation of the accession of the successor to the throne.

Within the Royal Households of the United Kingdom certain roles, such as Lord Steward and Lord Chamberlain, are by convention held by peers (since the 18th century), or in the case of Women of the Bedchamber (sometimes called ladies-in-waiting) the daughters of peers. Certain roles are informally attached hereditarily to certain peerages: for example, the Lord High Constable of Scotland is hereditarily held by the Earl of Erroll.

==Within the honours system==
The peerage forms part of the British honours system, as the highest tier. This role dates back to the days when being ennobled by the monarch meant secure addition for someone and their heirs into the British aristocracy, and alongside it, political power and a theoretically raised status within the hierarchy of the British class system.

These days as most peerages are for life and not hereditary, addition for one&#x27;s heirs into the &#x27;titled&#x27; British nobility is no longer guaranteed with the granting of a peerage. Instead the granting of a peerage forms part of the honour system because it brings with it an honorific, title and style for life as a reward in overt recognition of the recipient&#x27;s contributions to society, or some segment thereof.

This is in contrast to those who inherit hereditary peerages, which are not inherited in recognition of the merits of the heir to the title, but according to the rules laid out in the original letters patent. The &#x27;honour&#x27; is in recognition of the actions of the initial grantee, remembered through their heirs. The UK now has a presumption against the creation of new hereditary peerages, on the understanding that honours should be reserved for the meritorious service of individuals. This has in turn led to calls from some segments of British government and society to change the inheritance rules for existing hereditary peerages, and in some instances for the abolition/revocation of existing hereditary peerages altogether.

Although life peerages do not guarantee the entry of one&#x27;s heirs into the &#x27;titled&#x27; British nobility, the legitimate children of life peers appointed under the &quot;Life Peerages Act 1958&quot; are entitled to style themselves with the prefix &quot;The Honourable&quot;. Peers are also entitled to apply for a coat of arms, from the heraldic authorities of the United Kingdom. A coat of arms can be inherited, with armigers forming part of the &#x27;untitled&#x27; British nobility according to some sources.

As noted above, despite forming part of the honours system, nominations for peerages do not come from an Honours Committee but from the sovereign directly (though functionally on the advice of their government).

Given the political powers that come with a peerage title, some commentators have suggested the peerage should be separated from the Honours system. In 2016 Baron Lloyd-Webber for example wrote &quot;I was put in as an honour, not as a working peer. Not as lobby fodder. I’m fed-up with the fact that I keep being asked now to go in and vote for things about which I don’t have knowledge.&quot; Since the &quot;House of Lords Reform Act 2014&quot;, peers may resign from the House of Lords, and thereby surrender their legislative power, whilst keeping their title and style.

==Privileges==
The privilege of peerage is the body of privileges that belongs to peers, their wives and their unremarried widows. The privilege is distinct from parliamentary privilege, and applies to all peers, not just members of the House of Lords. It still exists, although &quot;occasions of its exercise have now diminished into obscurity.&quot;

Although the extent of the privilege has been ill-defined, three features survived to the 20th century: the right to be tried by fellow peers in the Lord High Steward&#x27;s Court and in the House of Lords (abolished in 1948); the personal right of access to the sovereign at any time, but this privilege has long been obsolete; and the right to be exempt from civil arrest (a privilege that has been used only twice since 1945). All privileges of a peerage are lost if a peer disclaims his or her peerage under the &quot;Peerage Act 1963&quot;.

===Judicial Privilege===

Under the privilege of peerage, peers themselves had the right to be tried for impeachment, felonies or for high treason by other peers in the House of Lords (instead of commoners on juries). In such cases a Lord High Steward would be appointed to preside over the trial – functionally this was usually done by temporarily elevating the Lord Chancellor to this role. Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville was the last person to be tried in the House of Lords on impeachment in 1806. In December 1935 Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham was elevated from Lord Chancellor to Lord High Steward to preside over the last ever trial of a peer ‘by his peers’, with the trial of the 26th Baron de Clifford in the House of Lords for manslaughter. The right to be tried by other peers in the House of Lords was abolished at the request of the Lords in 1948 by Criminal Justice Act 1948.

===Salary, renumeration and land===

There is no automatic right to a salary for being a peer; this includes peers who serve in parliament, who (unlike MPs in the House of Commons) do not receive a salary for their role. However, peers who serve in the House of Lords are entitled to claim £342 allowance for each day they attend to help cover expenses. In an effort to ensure peers from outside the capital were not disadvantaged, peers whose registered home address is outside Greater London can also claim travel expenses and up to £100 towards the cost of a hotel or similar accommodation. Peers who serve in government as ministers are not entitled to claim these allowances, however, and thus their roles are often jointly given with sinecure roles, or they are appointed to salaried positions in the Royal Household. For example, the position of Leader of the House of Lords is usually appointed with the accompanying sinecure role of Lord Privy Seal, as the latter carries a salary. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords is appointed jointly to the role of Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, and the Government deputy chief whip is appointed jointly as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. This allows them to take a salary from the Royal Household as heads of the Sovereign&#x27;s Bodyguard. The salaries of the Leader of the Opposition and Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords are paid out of public funds alongside the so called Cranborne Money, the annual payment to opposition parties in the House of Lords to help them with their costs.

Though a small minority of peerages have associated hereditary royal offices — for example the office of Earl Marshal has been consistently and hereditarily held by the dukes of Norfolk since 1672 — peerages do not automatically grant the holders royal offices or privileges. The feudal titles (such as Lordship of the Manor titles) that peerages largely replaced often have associated royal offices because they were held via Grand serjeanty, e.g. the Lord of the Manor of Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire holds the office of King&#x27;s Champion.

Peerages do not automatically grant specific land rights or privileges (unlike the feudal titles they largely replaced) and the territorial designation of a peerage title does not indicate any land ownership nor entitle the holder to any benefit from the territory or land named. For example, the Marquess of Salisbury owns the mineral rights below Welwyn Garden City, not because of the peerage, but because he also owns the separate historic feudal title &quot;Lord of the Manor of Hatfield&quot; which granted these rights. The very limited historical exceptions to this are the County palatinate of Chester belonging to the Earl of Chester, which held some limited privileges until 1830, and the Duchy of Cornwall conferred on the Duke of Cornwall. Both of these titles are royal peerages traditionally held by the heir to the throne. The Duchy of Lancaster also exists, but is not associated with a peerage title, but rather the courtesy title of Duke of Lancaster held by the monarch. There were also palatine districts in Ireland, of which the most notable were those of the Earls of Desmond and the Earls of Ormond in County Tipperary in the Peerage of Ireland. The latter continued in existence until it was abolished by the County Palatine of Tipperary Act 1715. In Scotland, the earldom of Strathearn was identified as a county palatine in the 14th century, although the title of Earl of Strathearn has usually been merged with the Crown in subsequent centuries and there is little indication that the status of Strathearn differed in practice from other Scottish earldoms.

Though peerages, particularly hereditary peerages, are associated with country houses set within large estates, there is no explicit formal link between the two, and many hereditary peers are now separated from the country estates their ancestors owned, while many life peers have never owned such estates. Through history, some peers inherited manor houses from the feudal era, while others built new prodigy houses, or later purchased country estates with wealth made in the empire or industry. Some country houses were gifted to peers &quot;by the nation&quot;, such as Blenheim Palace for the 1st Duke of Marlborough and Trafalgar Park for the 1st Earl Nelson. Historically, some hereditary peers used an entail in an effort to prevent their estate from being separated from the peerage titles by their heirs and reinforcing the practice of primogeniture. The entail practice was essentially abolished by the early half of the 20th century, and many peers and members of the landed gentry had to sell their estates due to political and economic changes.

===Access===

Peers retain a theoretical right to an audience with the monarch at any time, though this privilege has long been obsolete. Peers who have served in the House of Lords (including those retired) have dining rights in the House of Lords dining halls, which also permit them to bring up to six guests. Peers may also use the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft at the Palace of Westminster for weddings and christenings for themselves and their families at the discretion of the Lady Usher of the Black Rod.

===Official &amp; Heraldic Privileges===

Certain specific personal privileges are afforded to many peers and peeresses. For example, the Duke of Atholl in Scotland is permitted the only legal private army in Europe, the Atholl Highlanders; a privilege granted by Queen Victoria. Also in Scotland, currently four peers are permitted to appoint private officers of arms recognised by the court of the Lord Lyon (though this is principally in their capacity as Clan Chiefs, an office nominally separate from their peerage).

There are a number of heraldic privileges which are either exclusive, or almost exclusive, to peers such as the granting of supporters and certain helmets.

===Social Privileges===

There are formal and social clubs organised exclusively for peers, such as the House of Lords Yacht Club. Until 2015 peers in the House of Lords could join the parliamentary rifle club which was located in a rifle range in the basement of the House of Lords.

Though not a formally recognised privilege, peers have often historically made up a significant percentage of Lord Lieutenancy appointments. These are the Monarch&#x27;s representatives in a county. Though there has been greater diversity in recent years, a number of these appointments are still held by peers. Again, while not a formal privilege, peers are also frequently included on guest lists for Royal Garden Parties, Royal Weddings, and Royal Funerals. Peers also make up a significant number of appointments to the Orders of the Garter and Thistle as well as senior tiers of the Royal Victorian Order, all of which are appointed solely at the Sovereign&#x27;s discretion. Peers often make up other high society social appointments; for example His Majesty&#x27;s Representative at Ascot is a post usually held by a peer.

The main formal social distinction of a peerage nowadays, apart from access to the House of Lords for life peers and some hereditary peers, is the title and style thereby accorded.

== History of the Peerage ==
===Baronage evolution===
The modern-day parliamentary peerage is a successor of the medieval baronage system which emerged in the English feudal era. Feudalism was introduced to England after 1066 by William the Conqueror and taken to Scotland by David I in 1124 when, after having lived in England as Earl of Huntingdon, he succeeded to the Scottish throne.

A Barony was a form of feudal landholding, where individuals were appointed by the king, as his tenants-in-chief – that is to say people who held land by feudal tenure directly from the king as their sole overlord and were granted by him a legal jurisdiction (court baron) over said territory. The nation had been divided into many &quot;manors&quot;, the owners of the manors came to be known as barons; those who held many manors were known as &quot;greater barons&quot;, while those with fewer manors were the &quot;lesser barons&quot;. Certain other office-holders such as senior clerics and Freemen of the Cinque Ports were also deemed &quot;Barons&quot;. The baronage was the collectively inclusive term denoting all members of the feudal nobility. As the baronage were &#x27;overlords&#x27; the term &#x27;Lord&#x27; came to be used as an appellation.

Under the old system of feudalism, some Lords had the authority to effectively create titles of their own (through powers like Subinfeudation), such as the Barony of Halton which was created by the Earl of Chester, or the Irish hereditary Knight of Kerry which was created by the Earl of Desmond. Through acts like the &quot;Quia Emptores&quot; of 1290 these powers were stripped back, and the authority to create titles was entrenched as exclusive to the monarch.

===Early Parliament===

The modern peerage system is a vestige of the custom of English kings in the 12th and 13th centuries to grant a right to Barons to attend parliament; in the late 14th century, this right (or &quot;title&quot;) began to be granted by decree, and titles also became inherited with the rest of a manorial estate under the system of primogeniture.

The requirement to attend Parliament was both a liability and a privilege for those who held land as a tenant-in-chief from the King &quot;per baroniam&quot;: that is to say, under the feudal contract wherein a King&#x27;s Baron was responsible for raising knights and troops for the royal military service.

When kings summoned their barons to Royal Councils, the greater barons were summoned individually by the sovereign, lesser barons through sheriffs, a local judicial office from the Anglo-Saxon era meaning &#x27;shire-reeve&#x27; formerly selected from the thane class.

In England in 1254, the lesser barons ceased to be summoned, and this right, entitlement or &quot;title&quot; to attend parliament began to be granted by decree in the form of a Writ of summons from 1265. This body of greater barons evolved into the House of Lords. Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that &quot;No free man shall be seized, imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or ruined in any way, nor in any way proceeded against, except by the lawful judgement of his peers&quot;, and thus this body of greater Barons were deemed to be &quot;peers&quot; of one another, and it became the norm to refer to these magnates as a &quot;peerage&quot; during the reign of Edward II.

Meanwhile the holders of smaller fiefdoms &quot;per baroniam&quot; ceased to be summoned to parliament; thus the official political importance of ownership of manors declined, resulting in baronial status becoming a personal title rather than one linked to ownership of territory.

Eventually &#x27;writs of summons&#x27; ceased to be issued, and Letters patent were used to create new lordships: new lords were summoned to parliament by Letters patent from 1388. The first baron to be created by patent was Lord Beauchamp of Holt in the reign of Richard II.

Feudal baronies had always been hereditable by primogeniture, but on condition of payment of a fine, termed &quot;relief&quot;, derived from the Latin verb &quot;levo&quot;, to lift up, meaning a &quot;re-elevation&quot; to a former position of honour. By the beginning of the 14th century, the hereditary nature of the peerage was well developed. Since the Crown was itself a hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. Baronies and other titles of nobility became unconditionally hereditable on the abolition of feudal tenure by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660.

===Transition from feudalism===

Thus over time baronies by writ effectively became hereditary peerages, even if this had not been the intention of the original issuer of the writ. By the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, many remaining baronies by tenure who did not have an established inherited writ of summons were converted into baronies by writ, thereby bringing them into line with the other peerages.
While non-heritable &quot;peerages for life&quot; were often created in the early days of the peerage, their regular creation was not provided for by Act of Parliament until the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 and in 1958 more generally.

The rank of earl dates to Anglo-Saxon times. The ranks of duke and marquess were introduced in the 14th century, and that of viscount in the 15th century.

==Ranks==
Peers are of five ranks, in descending order of hierarchy:
* Duke comes from the Latin &quot;dux&quot;, meaning &#x27;leader&#x27;. The first duke in a peerage of the British Isles was created in 1337. The feminine form is Duchess.
* Marquess comes from the French &quot;marquis&quot;, which is a derivative of &quot;marche&quot; or march. This is a reference to the borders (&#x27;marches&#x27;) between England, Scotland, and Wales, a relationship more evident in the feminine form, Marchioness. The first marquess in a peerage of the British Isles was created in 1385. These replace a feudal concept known as a &quot;Marcher lord&quot;.
* Earl comes from the Old English or Anglo-Saxon &quot;eorl&quot;, meaning a military leader. The meaning may have been affected by the Old Norse &quot;jarl&quot;, meaning a free-born warrior or nobleman, during the Danelaw, thus giving rise to the modern sense. These are equivalent to a count on the continent. Since there was no feminine Old English or Old Norse equivalent for the term, &#x27;Countess&#x27; is used (as Earls are analogous to the Continental &#x27;Counts&#x27;), from the Latin &quot;comes&quot;. The rank was created –1000. In the Peerage of Scotland the title of Mormaer evolved into the Earldom in the 13th century as Scots gradually replaced Gaelic as the dominant vernacular language.
* Viscount comes from the Latin &quot;vicecomes&quot;, meaning &#x27;vice-count&#x27; - or below a count (indicating its ranking as below Earls who are themselves equivalent to a continental Count). The rank was created in 1440. The feminine form is Viscountess.
* Baron comes from the Old Germanic &quot;baro&quot;, meaning &#x27;freeman&#x27;. The rank was created in 1066. In England this was initially a feudal title introduced by the Normans that was gradually merged into the peerage. In the Peerage of Scotland alone, a holder of the fifth rank is not called a &#x27;Baron&#x27; but rather a &#x27;Lord of Parliament&#x27;. As in England Barons in Scotland were traditionally holders of feudal dignities, however, the Scottish didn&#x27;t adopt the practice of Barons as a peerage title until the Acts of Union 1707 and the introduction of the Peerage of Great Britain. In addition to &quot;extant&quot; Lords of Parliament in the Peerage of Scotland, many Scottish feudal Barons are also still in existence but are not part of the peerage system. The feminine form of Baron is Baroness.

Baronets, while holders of hereditary titles, are not peers, although socially they are regarded as part of the aristocracy.

Lords of the manor are also not peers, but are instead a remnant of the English feudal system. They have historically been associated with the English landed gentry and squirearchy within the context of the class structure of the United Kingdom and many peers may also be Lords of the Manor. The status of lord of the manor is today often associated with the rank of esquire by prescription. Likewise, in Scotland &quot;Lairds&quot; are not part of the peerage system, but a courtesy title applied to an owner of a large, long-established Scottish estate affording recognition of a territorial designation as a part of their name by the Lord Lyon.

Knights, dames and holders of other British non-hereditary chivalric orders, decorations, and medals are likewise not peers.

== Types of peers ==
=== Hereditary peers ===

A hereditary peer is a peer of the realm whose dignity may be inherited; those able to inherit it are said to be &quot;in remainder&quot;. Hereditary peerage dignities may be created with writs of summons or by letters patent; the former method is now obsolete. Writs of summons summon an individual to Parliament, in the old feudal tradition, and merely &quot;implied&quot; the existence or creation of a hereditary peerage dignity, which is automatically inherited, presumably according to the traditional medieval rules (male-preference primogeniture, like the succession of the British crown until 2011). Letters patent explicitly create a dignity and specify its course of inheritance (usually agnatic succession, like the Salic Law). Some hereditary titles can pass through and vest in female heirs in a system called coparcenary. Following the &quot;Succession to the Crown Act 2013&quot;, which replaced male-preference primogeniture with absolute primogeniture in the line of succession to the throne, there were calls from some hereditary peers&#x27; daughters to change the rules for hereditary peerages to match. In 2018 five daughters of hereditary peers took the government to the European Court of Human Rights to challenge the laws that stop them from inheriting their fathers titles and thereby being elected to the House of Lords.

Once created, a peerage dignity continues to exist as long as there are surviving legitimate descendants (or legitimate agnatic descendants) of the first holder, unless a contrary method of descent is specified in the letters patent. Once the heirs of the original peer die out, the peerage dignity becomes extinct. In former times, peerage dignities were often &quot;forfeit&quot; by Acts of Parliament, usually when peers were found guilty of treason. Often, however, the felonious peer&#x27;s descendants successfully petitioned the sovereign to restore the dignity to the family. Some dignities, such as the Dukedom of Norfolk, have been forfeit and restored several times. Under the &quot;Peerage Act 1963&quot; an individual can disclaim his peerage dignity for his own lifetime within one year of inheriting it.

When the holder of a peerage succeeds to the throne, the dignity &quot;merges in the Crown&quot; and ceases to exist.

All hereditary peers in the Peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom were entitled to sit in the House of Lords, subject only to qualifications such as age and citizenship, but under section 1 of the &quot;House of Lords Act 1999&quot; they lost this right. The Act provided that 92 hereditary peers — the Lord Great Chamberlain and the Earl Marshal, along with 90 others exempted through standing orders of the House — would remain in the House of Lords in the interim, pending any reform of the membership to the House. Standing Order 9 provides that those exempted are 75 hereditary peers elected by other peers from and by respective party groups in the House in proportion to their numbers, and fifteen chosen by the whole House to serve as officers of the House.

=== Representative peers ===

From 1707 until 1963, Scottish peers elected 16 Scottish representative peers to sit in the House of Lords. Since 1963, they have had the same rights as Peers of the United Kingdom. From 1801 until 1922, Irish peers elected 28 Irish representative peers to sit in the House of Lords. Since 1922, when the Irish Free State became a separate country, no Irish representative peers have been elected, though sitting members retained their seats for life.

=== Life peers ===
Apart from hereditary peerages, there exist peerages that may be held for life and whose title cannot be passed onto someone else by inheritance. The &quot;Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876&quot; and the &quot;Life Peerages Act 1958&quot; authorise the regular creation of life peerages, with the right to sit in the House of Lords. Life peers created under both acts are of baronial rank and are always created under letters patent.

Since the loss of the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords as a result of the &quot;House of Lords Act 1999&quot;, the majority of the House of Lords is made up of life peers. There is no limit on the number of peerages the sovereign may create under the &quot;Life Peerages Act&quot;. Normally life peerages are granted to individuals nominated by political parties or by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, and in order to honour retiring politicians, current senior judges, and senior members of the armed forces.

Until the formal opening of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2009, life peers created under the &quot;Appellate Jurisdiction Act&quot; were known as &quot;Lords of Appeal in Ordinary&quot; or in common parlance &quot;Law Lords&quot;. They performed the judicial functions of the House of Lords and served on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. They remained peers for life, but ceased to receive judicial salaries at the age of 75. Under the terms of the Act, there may be no more than 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary under the age of 75 at one time. However, after the transfer of the judicial functions of the Lords to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Act ceased to have meaningful effect.

Under the &quot;House of Lords Reform Act 2014&quot; and the &quot;House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015&quot; a life peer may lose membership of the House of Lords permanently in one of four ways:
* Resignation or retirement effected by writing to the Clerk of the Parliaments;
* Automatic expulsion through failing to attend a single sitting of the House throughout a whole session of more than six months&#x27; duration without leave of absence, being suspended for that session or being exempted by the House for special circumstances;
* Automatic expulsion through conviction of a criminal offence where the punishment is imprisonment for more than one year;
* Expulsion by resolution of the House.

While these provide for non-membership of the House of Lords, they do not allow a life peer to disclaim their peerage in the same way that a hereditary peer can disclaim theirs.

== Form of title ==
The titles of peers are in the form of &quot;(Rank) (TitleName)&quot; or &quot;(Rank) of (TitleName)&quot;. The name of the title can either be a place name or a surname or a combination of both (e.g. The Duke of Norfolk or The Earl Spencer). The precise usage depends on the rank of the peerage and on certain other general considerations. For instance, Dukes always use &quot;of&quot;. Marquesses and Earls whose titles are based on place names normally use &quot;of&quot; (e.g. The Marquess of Bute and The Marquess of Ailsa), while those whose titles are based on surnames normally do not (e.g. The Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and The Earl Alexander of Tunis). Viscounts, Barons and Lords of Parliament generally do not use &quot;of&quot;. However, there are several exceptions to the rule. For instance, Scottish vicecomital titles theoretically include &quot;of&quot;, though in practice it is usually dropped (e.g. &quot;The Viscount of Falkland&quot; is commonly known as the &quot;Viscount Falkland&quot;.)

=== Multiple, compound and other names ===
While surnames and place names have been commonly used for peerage titles, it is also possible to create other forms of title. For instance, existing double-barrelled surnames have been used for titles (e.g. The Baroness Burdett-Coutts and The Baroness Spencer-Churchill) and other double-barrelled surnames have been created for peerages themselves (e.g. The Lord George-Brown). In a similar way, some peerage titles have been invented by combining surnames (e.g. The Viscount Leverhulme was invented by William Lever by combining his and his wife&#x27;s surname of Hulme) or combining other names (e.g. The Viscount Alanbrooke which was created by Alan Brooke by combining his first and last names).

&quot;Multiple&quot; and &quot;compound&quot; peerage titles have also evolved. A single individual can accumulate, by achievements or by inheritance, more than one peerage (of the same rank) and be known by a &#x27;compound&#x27; of these titles (e.g. &quot;The &quot;Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry&#x27;&quot; even though these peerages were originally created separately (i.e. the Dukedom of Buccleuch (created in 1663) and the Dukedom of Queensberry (created in 1684) but unified in the person of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch and 5th Duke of Queensberry and his descendants).

On the other hand, a &quot;compound&quot;&quot; peerage refers to a title &quot;specifically created&quot; as a compound of two or more names, such as Baron Saye and Sele (created in 1440) and Baron Brougham and Vaux (created in 1830). The last hereditary compound titles to be created (for each rank) were the Duke of Clarence and Avondale (created in 1890), the Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair (created in 1916), the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (created in 1937), the Viscount Newry and Mourne (created in 1822) and the Baron Dalling and Bulwer (created in 1871).

=== Geographic association ===
A territorial designation is often added to the main peerage title, especially in the case of barons and viscounts: for instance, &quot;The Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire&quot;, or &quot;The Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, of Hindhead in the County of Surrey&quot;. Any designation after the comma does not form a part of the main title. Territorial designations in titles are not updated with local government reforms, but new creations do take them into account. Thus there is &quot;The Baron Knollys, of Caversham in the County of Oxford&quot; (created in 1902), and &quot;The Baroness Pitkeathley, of Caversham in the Royal County of Berkshire&quot; (created in 1997).

It was once the case that a peer administered the place associated with his title (such as an earl administering a county as high sheriff or main landowner), but lordships by tenure have not been commonplace since the early Norman period. The only remaining peerages with certain associated rights over land are the Duchy of Cornwall (place), which appertains to the Dukedom of Cornwall, held by the eldest son and heir to the sovereign, and the Duchy of Lancaster (place), which regular income (revenue) appertains to the Dukedom of Lancaster, held by the sovereign whose government owns the capital and all capital gains on disposals. In both cases due to the particular function of bona vacantia in these areas, these titles afford rights encompassing the whole territorial designation of the holder, donated by the holder now to registered charities. Separate estates, smaller than counties, form the bulk of the two duchies.

== Styles and forms of address ==
===Style===

Dukes use &quot;His Grace&quot;, Marquesses use &quot;The Most Honourable&quot; and other peers use &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. Peeresses (whether they hold peerages in their own right or are wives of peers) use equivalent styles.

===Honorific===
Individuals who use the appellation &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; are not necessarily peers. There are judicial, ecclesiastic and holders of other crown offices who are often accorded the appellation &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; as a form of courtesy title as a product of their office. Those who hold feudal titles are, however, never accorded the honorific &quot;Lord&quot;. The holder of a lordship of the manor for example can be styled as Charles S, Lord/Lady of the Manor of [Placename], but would not be referred to as Lord Charles S of [Placename].

In speech, any peer or peeress except a Duke or Duchess is referred to as &quot;Lord X&quot; or &quot;Lady X&quot;. The exception is a &quot;suo jure&quot; baroness (that is, one holding the dignity in her own right, usually a life peeress), who may also be called &quot;Baroness X&quot; in normal speech, though &quot;Lady X&quot; is also common usage. Hence, The Baroness Thatcher, a &quot;suo jure&quot; life peeress, was referred to as either &quot;Baroness Thatcher&quot; or &quot;Lady Thatcher&quot;. &quot;Baroness&quot; is incorrect for female holders of Scottish Lordships of Parliament, who are not Baronesses; for example, the 21st Lady Saltoun was known as &quot;Lady Saltoun&quot;, not &quot;Baroness Saltoun&quot;.

A peer is referred to by his peerage even if it is the same as his surname, thus the Baron Owen is &quot;Lord Owen&quot; not &quot;Lord David Owen&quot;, though such erroneous forms are commonly used.

Some peers, particularly life peers who were well known before their ennoblement, do not use their peerage titles. Others use a combination: for example, the author John Julius Norwich was John Julius Cooper, 2nd Viscount Norwich.

Children of peers use special titles called courtesy titles. The heir apparent of a duke, a marquess, or an earl generally uses his father&#x27;s highest lesser peerage dignity as his own. Hence, The Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s son is called the Marquess of Hartington. Such an heir apparent is called a &quot;courtesy peer&quot;, but is a commoner until such time as he inherits (unless summoned by a writ in acceleration).

Younger sons of dukes and marquesses prefix &quot;Lord&quot; to their first names as courtesy titles while daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls use &quot;Lady&quot;. Younger sons of earls and children of viscounts, barons and lords of Parliament use &quot;The Honourable&quot;.

Divorced peeresses &quot;cannot claim the privileges or status of Peeresses which they derived from their husbands&quot;. While a divorced former wife of a duke is no longer a duchess, she may still use the title, styled with her forename prefixed to the title (without the definite article, &quot;the&quot;). Her forename is used primarily to differentiate her from any new wife of her former husband. However, should the former husband remain unmarried, the former wife may continue to use the title without her forename attached. Should a former wife of a peer remarry, she would lose the style of a divorced peeress and take on a style relating to her new husband. Examples include Louise Timpson, who during her marriage to The Duke of Argyll was known as &quot;Her Grace&quot; The Duchess of Argyll but became &quot;Louise, Duchess of Argyll&quot; following her divorce, a style which she eventually lost after her subsequent marriage upon which she became known as Mrs. Robert Timpson.

== Vestments ==

===Robes===
Peerage robes are currently worn in the United Kingdom on ceremonial occasions. They are of two varieties: parliament robes, worn in the House of Lords on occasions such as at a peer&#x27;s introduction or state opening of parliament, and coronation robes, worn at the coronations of monarchs. The details of the fur on these robes differs according to a peer&#x27;s rank.

Since the early Middle Ages, robes have been worn as a sign of nobility. At first, these seem to have been bestowed on individuals by the monarch or feudal lord as a sign of special recognition; but in the fifteenth century the use of robes became formalised with peers all wearing robes of the same basic design, though varied according to the rank of the wearer.

=== Coronets and headgear ===


In the United Kingdom, a peer wears his or her coronet on only one occasion: for the monarch&#x27;s coronation, when it is worn along with coronation robes.

*The coronet of a duke or duchess has eight strawberry leaves;
*The coronet of a marquess or marchioness has four strawberry leaves and four silver balls (known as &quot;pearls&quot;);
*The coronet of an earl or countess has eight strawberry leaves and eight &quot;pearls&quot; raised on stalks;
*The coronet of a viscount or viscountess has sixteen &quot;pearls&quot; touching one another;
*The coronet of a baron or baroness, or lord or lady of parliament in the Scots peerage, has six &quot;pearls&quot;, and a plain circlet lacking the gem-shaped chasing of the other coronets.

The robes and coronets used at Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation in 1953 cost about £1,250 (roughly £ in present-day terms). (Peers under the rank of an Earl, however, were allowed in 1953 to wear a cheaper &quot;cap of estate&quot; in place of a coronet, as were peeresses of the same rank, for whom a simpler robe was also permitted (a one-piece gown with wrap-around fur cape, designed by Norman Hartnell).

With the Parliament robe, a black hat was customarily worn. The Wriothesley Garter Book provides a contemporary illustration of the 1523 State Opening of Parliament: the two dukes present are shown wearing coronets with their parliament robes, but the other Lords Temporal are all wearing black hats. The Lords Spiritual are wearing mitres with their distinctive robes. Mitres ceased to be worn after the Reformation, and the wearing of hats in Parliament ceased, for the most part, when wigs came into fashion. They survive today only as part of the dress of Lords Commissioners, when they are worn with the parliamentary robe: a bicorn hat for men (of black beaver, edged with silk grosgrain ribbon) and a tricorne-like hat for women. (The use of these hats at introductions of peers to the House was discontinued in 1998.)

== Precedence ==
Peers are entitled to a special precedence because of their ranks. Wives and children of peers are also entitled to a special precedence because of their station.

The sovereign may, as fount of honour, vary the precedence of the peers or of any other people. For example, Elizabeth II granted her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, precedence immediately following her; otherwise, he would have ranked along with the other dukes of the peerage of the United Kingdom.

===General precedence===
In England and Wales, the sovereign ranks first, followed by the Royal Family. Then follow the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Great Officers of State and other important state functionaries such as the prime minister. Thereafter, dukes precede marquesses, who precede earls, who precede viscounts, who precede bishops, who precede barons and lords of Parliament.

Within the members of each rank of the peerage, peers of England precede peers of Scotland. English and Scottish peers together precede peers of Great Britain. All of the aforementioned precede peers of Ireland created before 1801. Last come peers of Ireland created after 1801 and peers of the United Kingdom. Among peers of the same rank and Peerage, precedence is based on the creation of the title: those whose titles were created earlier precede those whose titles were created later. But in no case would a peer of a lower rank precede one of a higher rank. For example, the Duke of Fife, the last non-royal to be created a duke, would come before the Marquess of Winchester, though the latter&#x27;s title was created earlier and is in a more senior peerage (the peerage of England).

The place of a peer in the order for gentlemen is taken by his wife in the order for ladies, except that a dowager peeress of a particular title precedes the present holder of the same title. Children of peers (and &quot;suo jure&quot; peeresses) also obtain a special precedence. The following algorithm may be used to determine their ranks:
* Eldest sons of peers of rank X go after peers of rank X−1
* Younger sons of peers of rank X go after eldest sons of peers of rank X−1
* Wives have a precedence corresponding to those of their husbands
* Daughters of peers of rank X go after wives of eldest sons of peers of rank X
Over time, however, various offices were inserted at different points in the order, thereby varying it.

Eldest sons of dukes rank after marquesses; eldest sons of marquesses and then younger sons of dukes rank after earls; eldest sons of earls and then younger sons of marquesses rank after viscounts. Eldest sons of viscounts, younger sons of earls, and then eldest sons of barons, in that order, follow barons, with the Treasurer of the Household, the Comptroller of the Household, the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household and Secretaries of State being interpolated between them and the barons. Younger sons of viscounts, and then younger sons of barons, come after the aforesaid eldest sons of barons, with Knights of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle, Privy councillors and senior judges being intercalated between them and eldest sons of barons.

Children of the eldest son of a peer also obtain a special precedence. Generally, the eldest son of the eldest son of a peer comes immediately before his uncles, while the younger sons of the eldest son of a peer come after them. Therefore, eldest sons of eldest sons of dukes come before younger sons of dukes, and younger sons of eldest sons of dukes come after them, and so forth for all the ranks. Below the younger sons of barons are baronets, knights, circuit judges and companions of the various orders of Chivalry, followed by the eldest sons of younger sons of peers.

Wives of all of the aforementioned have precedence corresponding to their husbands&#x27;, unless otherwise entitled to a higher precedence, for instance by virtue of holding a certain office. An individual&#x27;s daughter takes precedence after the wife of that individual&#x27;s eldest son and before the wives of that individual&#x27;s younger sons. Therefore, daughters of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of peers; daughters of eldest sons of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of eldest sons of peers; daughters of younger sons of peers rank after wives of eldest sons of younger sons of peers. Such a daughter keeps her precedence if marrying a commoner (unless that marriage somehow confers a higher precedence), but rank as their husband if marrying a peer.

===Precedence within Parliament===
The order of precedence used to determine seating in the House of Lords chamber is governed by the &quot;House of Lords Precedence Act 1539&quot;. Precedence as provided by the Act is similar to, but not the same as, the order outside Parliament. The sovereign, however, does not have the authority to change the precedence assigned by the Act.

Lords Temporal assume precedence similar to precedence outside Parliament. One difference in the precedence of peers relates to the positions of the Great Officers of State and the officers of the sovereign&#x27;s Household. Some Great Officers—the Lord Chancellor, the Lord High Treasurer, the Lord President of the Council and the Lord Privy Seal—provided they are peers, rank before all other peers except those who are of the Blood Royal (no precedence is accorded if they are not peers). The positions of the other Great Officers—the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Lord High Constable, the Earl Marshal and the Lord High Admiral—and the officers of the Household—the Lord Steward and the Lord Chamberlain—are based on their respective ranks. Thus, if the Lord Steward were a duke, he would precede all dukes, if a marquess, he would precede all marquesses, and so on. If two such officers are of the same rank, the precedence of the offices (reflected by the order in which they are mentioned above) is taken into account: if the Lord Great Chamberlain and Earl Marshal were both marquesses, for example, then the Great Chamberlain would precede the Earl Marshal, as the former office precedes the latter.

In practice, however, the Act is obsolete, as the Lords do not actually sit according to strict precedence; instead, peers sit with their political parties.

== Heraldry ==

Peers are generally entitled to use certain heraldic devices. Atop the arms, a peer may display a coronet. Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were engraved while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones. Generally, only peers may use the coronets corresponding to their ranks. The Bishop of Durham, however, may use a duke&#x27;s coronet atop the arms as a reference to the historical temporal authority of the Prince-Bishops of Durham.

Peers wear their coronets at coronations. Otherwise, coronets are seen only in heraldic representations, atop a peer&#x27;s arms. Coronets include a silver gilt chaplet and a base of ermine fur. The coronet varies with the rank of the peer. A member of the Royal Family uses a royal coronet instead of the coronet he or she would use as a peer or peeress.

Ducal coronets include eight strawberry leaves atop the chaplet, five of which are displayed in heraldic representations. Marquesses have coronets with four strawberry leaves alternating with four silver balls, of which three leaves and two balls are displayed. Coronets for earls have eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight silver balls (called &quot;pearls&quot; even though they are not) raised on spikes, of which five silver balls and four leaves are displayed. Coronets for viscounts have 16 silver balls, of which seven are displayed. Finally, baronial coronets have six silver balls, of which four are displayed. Peeresses use equivalent designs, but in the form of a circlet, which encircles the head, rather than a coronet, which rests atop the head.

Peers are entitled to the use of supporters in their achievements of arms. Hereditary supporters are normally limited to hereditary peers, certain members of the Royal Family, chiefs of Scottish Clans, Scottish feudal barons whose baronies predate 1587. Non-hereditary supporters are granted to life peers, Knights of the Garter, Knights of the Thistle, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Bath, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of St Michael and St George, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the British Empire, and knights banneret.

Peers, like most other armigers, may display helms atop their arms. Helms of peers are depicted in silver and facing the viewer&#x27;s left. The helm is garnished in gold and the closed visor has gold bars, normally numbering five. Along with the helm, peers use a mantling, one side of which is red and the other a representation of the heraldic fur ermine. The mantling of peers is emblazoned &quot;gules, doubled ermine&quot;. Peeresses and other female armigers do not bear helms or mantlings.

== Attempted primogeniture reforms ==
Since the Parliament of the United Kingdom enacted a series of reforms (from the 1960s onward) to the honours system, few hereditary titles have been created (the last being created in 1990), while life peerages have proliferated, allowing for more openly LGBT persons to be appointed to the House of Lords. However, despite the legalization of civil partnerships for same-sex couples in 2004 and marriage for same-sex couples in 2013, spouses of ennobled civil partners have not been allowed the extension of title and privilege from their spouses&#x27; ennoblements as those accorded to married opposite-sex spouses of ennobled persons. In July 2012, Conservative MP Oliver Colvile announced a private member&#x27;s bill, titled &quot;Honours (Equality of Titles for Partners) Bill 2012-13&quot;, to amend the honours system to both allow husbands of those made dames and for civil partners of recipients to receive honours by their relationship statuses. Another bill, the Equality (Titles) Bill, which would allow for both female first-born descendants to inherit hereditary titles as well as for &quot;husbands and civil partners&quot; of honours recipients &quot;to use equivalent honorary titles to those available to wives&quot;, was introduced by Lord Lucas in the House of Lords on 13 May 2013, but did not progress past Committee stage. Similar legislation was introduced in 2015, 2016 and 2023.

== Counterparts ==
Other feudal monarchies equally held a similar system, grouping high nobility of different rank titles under one term, with common privileges and/or in an assembly, sometimes legislative and/or judicial.

Itō Hirobumi and the other Meiji leaders deliberately modeled the Japanese House of Peers on the House of Lords, as a counterweight to the popularly elected House of Representatives (&quot;Shūgiin&quot;).

In France, the system of pairies (peerage) existed in two different versions: the exclusive &#x27;old&#x27; in the French kingdom, in many respects an inspiration for the English and later British practice, and the very prolific Chambre des Pairs under the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1848).

In Spain and Portugal, the closest equivalent title was Grandee; in Hungary, Magnat.

In the Kingdom of Sicily a peerage was instituted in 1812 in connection with the abolition of feudalism: peers were nominated based on the taxable incomes of their formerly feudal estates.

In the Holy Roman Empire, instead of an exclusive aristocratic assembly, the legislative body was the Imperial Diet, membership of which, expressed by the title Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, was granted to allied princely families (and various minor ones), as well as to Princes of the Church (parallel to the Lords Spiritual) and in some cases was restricted to a collective &#x27;curiate&#x27; vote in a &#x27;bench&#x27;, such as the Grafenbank.

In the medieval Irish nobility, Gaelic nobles were those presented with the White Wand or &quot;slat&quot; in a formal ceremony, and presented it by another noble. It was the primary symbol of lordship and effectively reserved only for the three tiers of kings (provincial, regional, local) and for those princely and comital families descending from them in control of significant territories. The total number was between 100 and 150 at any time.

<doc id="58255" wikidata="Q166886" url="?curid=58255" title="Duke">
<text>Duke is a male title either of a monarch ruling over a duchy, or of a member of royalty, or nobility. As rulers, dukes are ranked below emperors, kings, grand princes, grand dukes, and above sovereign princes. As royalty or nobility, they are ranked below princes and grand dukes. The title comes from French &quot;duc&quot;, itself from the Latin &quot;dux&quot;, &#x27;leader&#x27;, a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province. In most countries, the word duchess is the female equivalent.

Following the reforms of the emperor Diocletian (which separated the civilian and military administrations of the Roman provinces), a &quot;dux&quot; became the military commander in each province. The title &quot;dux&quot;, Hellenised to &quot;doux&quot;, survived in the Eastern Roman Empire where it continued in several contexts, signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general. Later on, in the 11th century, the title &quot;Megas Doux&quot; was introduced for the post of commander-in-chief of the entire navy.

During the Middle Ages the title (as &quot;Herzog&quot;) signified first among the Germanic monarchies. Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the king. A duke may or may not be, &quot;ipso facto&quot;, a member of the nation&#x27;s peerage: in the United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm, in France some were and some were not, while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations, even where an institution similar to the peerage (e.g. Grandeeship, Imperial Diet, Hungarian House of Magnates) existed.

During the 19th century, many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by dukes or grand dukes. But at present, with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there are no dukes ruling as monarchs. Duke remains the highest hereditary title (aside from titles borne by a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty) in Portugal (though now a republic), Spain, and the United Kingdom. In Sweden, members of the royal family are given a personal dukedom at birth. The Pope, as a temporal sovereign, has also, though rarely, granted the title of duke or duchess to persons for services to the Holy See. In some realms the relative status of &quot;duke&quot; and &quot;prince&quot;, as titles borne by the nobility rather than by members of reigning dynasties, varied—e.g., in Italy and Germany.

A woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is married to a duke, is normally styled duchess. Queen Elizabeth II, however, was known by tradition as Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands and Duke of Lancaster in Lancashire.

== Duchy and dukedom ==

A duchy is the territory or geopolitical entity ruled by a duke, whereas his title or area is often called a dukedom. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a fully independent state and its head, the Grand Duke, is a sovereign monarch reigning over his Luxembourgish subjects.

The Duke of Cornwall holds both the dukedom (title) and duchy (estate holdings), the latter being the source of his personal income; those living on the ducal estates are subjects of the British sovereign and owe neither fealty nor services to the duke &quot;per se&quot;. In Scotland, the male heir apparent to the British crown is always the Duke of Rothesay as well, but this is a dukedom (title) without a duchy. Similarly, the British monarch rules and owns the Duchy of Lancaster as Duke of Lancaster, but it is held separately from the Crown, with the income of the duchy estates providing the sovereign&#x27;s Privy Purse.

The Channel Islands are two of the three remaining Crown Dependencies, the last vestiges of the lands of the Duchy of Normandy. The Islanders in their loyal toast will say &quot;Le Roi, notre Duc&quot; (The King, Our Duke). Though the title was apparently renounced under the Treaty of Paris in 1259, the Crown still maintains that the title is retained: &quot;In 1106, William&#x27;s youngest son Henry I seized the Duchy of Normandy from his brother Robert; since that time, the English sovereign has always held the title Duke of Normandy&quot;, and that &quot;By 1205, England had lost most of its French lands, including Normandy. However, the Channel Islands, part of the lost Duchy, remained a self-governing possession of the English Crown. While the islands today retain autonomy in government, they owe allegiance to The King in his role as Duke of Normandy.&quot;

== Middle Ages ==
During the Middle Ages, after Roman power in Western Europe collapsed, the title was still employed in the Germanic kingdoms, usually to refer to the rulers of old Roman provinces.

=== Albania ===
The Venetians installed a &quot;Duke of Durazzo&quot; (today Durrës) during their brief rule over the city and its environs in 1205–1213.

In 1332, Robert of Taranto succeeded his father, Philip. Robert&#x27;s uncle, John, did not wish to do him homage for the Principality of Achaea, so Robert received Achaea from John in exchange for 5,000 ounces of gold and the rights to the diminished Kingdom of Albania. John took the style of Duke of Durazzo.

In 1368, Durazzo fell to Karl Thopia, who was recognized by Venice as &quot;Prince of Albania&quot;.

=== Visigoths ===
The Visigoths retained the Roman divisions of their kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula and it seems that dukes ruled over these areas. They were the most powerful landowners and, along with the bishops, elected the king, usually from their own midst. They were the military commanders and in this capacity often acted independently from the king, most notably in the latter period before the Muslim invasions.

The army was structured decimally with the highest unit, the thiufa, probably corresponding to about 1,000 people from each &quot;civitas&quot; (city district). The cities were commanded by counts, who were in turn answerable to the dukes, who called up the &quot;thiufae&quot; when necessary.

=== Lombards ===

When the Lombards entered Italy, the Latin chroniclers called their war leaders &quot;duces&quot; in the old fashion. These leaders eventually became the provincial rulers, each with a recognized seat of government. Though nominally loyal to the king, the concept of kingship was new to the Lombards and the dukes were highly independent, especially in central and southern Italy, where the Duke of Spoleto and the Duke of Benevento were &quot;de facto&quot; sovereigns. In 575, when Cleph died, a period known as the Rule of the Dukes, in which the dukes governed without a king, commenced. It lasted only a decade before the disunited magnates, to defend the kingdom from external attacks, elected a new king and even diminished their own duchies to provide him with a handsome royal demesne.

The Lombard kings were usually drawn from the duke pool when the title was not hereditary. The dukes tried to make their own offices hereditary. Beneath them in the internal structure were the counts and gastalds, a uniquely Lombard title initially referring to judicial functions, similar to a count&#x27;s, in provincial regions.

=== Franks ===
The Franks employed dukes as the governors of Roman provinces, though they also led military expeditions far from their duchies. The dukes were the highest-ranking officials in the realm, typically Frankish (whereas the counts were often Gallo-Roman), and formed the class from which the kings&#x27; generals were chosen in times of war. The dukes met with the king every May to discuss policy for the upcoming year, the so-called Mayfield.

In Burgundy and Provence, the titles of patrician and prefect were commonly employed instead of duke, probably for historical reasons relating to the greater Romanization of those provinces. But the titles were basically equivalent.

In late Merovingian Gaul, the mayors of the palace of the Arnulfing clan began to use the title &quot;dux et princeps Francorum&quot;: &#x27;duke and prince of the Franks&#x27;. In this title, &quot;duke&quot; implied supreme military control of the entire nation (&quot;Francorum&quot;, the Franks) and it was thus used until the end of the Carolingian dynasty in France in 987.

=== Holy Roman Empire ===

==== Stem duchies ====
The stem duchies were the constituent duchies of the kingdom of Germany at the time of the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty (the death of Louis the Child in 911) and the transitional period leading to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire later in the 10th century.
=== England ===

==== Anglo-Saxon times ====
In Anglo-Saxon England, where the Roman political divisions were largely abandoned, the highest political rank beneath that of king was ealdorman, and the first ealdormen were referred to as &quot;duces&quot; (the plural of the original Latin &quot;dux&quot;) in the chronicles. The title ealdorman was replaced by the Danish &quot;eorl&quot; (later earl) over time. After the Norman conquest, their power and regional jurisdiction was limited to that of the Norman counts.

==== Late medieval times ====

Edward III of England created the first English dukedom by naming his eldest son Edward, the Black Prince, as Duke of Cornwall in 1337. Upon the death of the Black Prince, the duchy of Cornwall passed to his nine-year-old son, who would eventually succeed his grandfather as Richard II.

The title of Duke of Lancaster was created by Edward III in 1351 for Henry of Grosmont, but became extinct upon the duke&#x27;s death in 1361. The following year, Edward III bestowed the title (2nd creation) on his fourth son, John of Gaunt, who was also married to the first duke&#x27;s daughter. On the same day Edward III also created his second son, Lionel of Antwerp, as Duke of Clarence.

All five of Edward III&#x27;s surviving sons eventually became dukes. In 1385, ten years after their father&#x27;s death, his heir Richard II created dukedoms for his last two uncles on the same day. Thomas of Woodstock was named Duke of Gloucester and Edmund of Langley became Duke of York, thereby founding the House of York, which later fought for the throne with John of Gaunt&#x27;s Lancastrian descendants during the Wars of the Roses.

By 1483, a total of 16 ducal titles had been created: Cornwall, Lancaster, Clarence, Gloucester, York, Ireland, Hereford, Aumale, Exeter, Surrey, Norfolk, Bedford, Somerset, Buckingham, Warwick and Suffolk. Some became extinct, others had multiple creations, and some had merged with the crown upon the holder&#x27;s accession to the throne. When the Plantagenet dynasty came to an end at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485, only four ducal titles remained extant, of which two were now permanently associated with the crown. John de la Pole was Duke of Suffolk and John Howard was Duke of Norfolk (2nd creation), while the duchy of Cornwall was reserved as a title and source of income for the eldest son of the sovereign, and the duchy of Lancaster was now held by the monarch.

Norfolk perished alongside Richard III at Bosworth field, and the title was forfeit. It was restored to his son Thomas thirty years later by Henry VIII, as one of a number of dukes created or recreated by the Tudor dynasty over the ensuing century. England&#x27;s premier ducal title, Norfolk, remains in the Howard family to this day.

== Modern age ==

In the 19th century, the sovereign dukes of Parma and Modena in Italy, and of Anhalt, Brunswick-Lüneburg, Nassau, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Altenburg in Germany survived Napoleon&#x27;s reorganization.

Since the unification of Italy in 1870 and the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918, there have no longer been any reigning dukes in Europe; Luxembourg is ruled by a grand duke, a higher title, just below king.

In the United Kingdom, the inherited position of a duke along with its dignities, privileges, and rights is a dukedom. However, the title of &quot;duke&quot; has never been associated with independent rule in the British Isles: they hold dukedoms, not duchies (excepting the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster). Dukes in the United Kingdom are addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot; and referred to as &quot;His Grace&quot;. Currently, there are thirty-five dukedoms in the Peerage of England, Peerage of Scotland, Peerage of Great Britain, Peerage of Ireland and Peerage of the United Kingdom, held by thirty different people, as three people hold two dukedoms and two hold three (see List of dukes in the peerages of Britain and Ireland).

All dukedoms in the UK apart from the Duchy of Lancaster are inherited through the male line only, although dukedoms such as Marlborough and Fife (second creation) have passed through the female line for one generation under terms of a special remainder for lack of male heirs of the initial grantee. Henrietta, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough and Her Highness Princess Alexandra (HRH Princess Arthur of Connaught), 2nd Duchess of Fife were duchesses in their own right. Both were succeeded in their titles by nephews born by younger sisters of the duchesses. The word &quot;duchess&quot; is normally only used for the wife of a duke. 

Dukes of Lancaster are called dukes even when they are female, and by tradition the monarch of the UK, whether male or female, is known in the Channel Islands as the Duke of Normandy.

== Royal dukes ==

Various royal houses traditionally awarded (mainly) dukedoms to the sons and in some cases, the daughters, of their respective sovereigns; others include at least one dukedom in a wider list of similarly granted titles, nominal dukedoms without any actual authority, often even without an estate. Such titles are still conferred on royal princes or princesses in the current European monarchies of Belgium, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Other historical cases occurred for example in Denmark, Finland (as a part of Sweden) and France, Portugal and some former colonial possessions such as Brazil and Haiti.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, a royal duke is a duke who is a member of the British royal family, entitled to the style of &quot;His Royal Highness&quot;. Ducal titles which have been given within the royal family include Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence, Duke of York, Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Bedford, Duke of Cumberland, Duke of Cambridge, Duke of Rothesay, Duke of Albany, Duke of Ross, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke of Kent, Duke of Sussex, and Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. Following his abdication in 1936 the former King Edward VIII was given the title Duke of Windsor.

There are also non-royal dukes in the United Kingdom.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the title of Duke of Brabant (historically the most prestigious in the Low Countries, and containing the federal capital Brussels) is awarded to the heir apparent of the monarch, other dynasts receiving various lower historical titles (much older than Belgium, and in principle never fallen to the Belgian crown), such as Count of Flanders (King Leopold III&#x27;s so-titled brother Charles held the title when he became the realm&#x27;s temporary head of state as prince-regent) and Prince of Liège (a secularised version of the historical prince-bishopric; e.g. King Albert II until he succeeded his older brother Baudouin I).

=== Iberian peninsula ===
When the Christian Reconquista, sweeping the Moors from the former Caliphate of Córdoba and its taifa-remnants, transformed the territory of former Suevic and Visigothic realms into Catholic feudal principalities, none of these warlords was exactly styled duke. A few (as Portugal itself) started as count (even if the title of &quot;dux&quot; was sometimes added), but soon all politically relevant princes were to use the royal style of king.

==== Portugal ====
In Portugal, the title of duke was granted for the first time in 1415 to infante Peter and infante Henry, the second and third sons of king John I, following their participation in the successful Conquest of Ceuta. Pedro became the first Duke of Coimbra and Henry the first Duke of Viseu.

From the reign of king Manuel I, the title of Duke of Beja was given to the second son of the monarch. This was changed during the Liberal regime in the 19th century (with Queen Maria II), when the first infante (second son of the monarch) got the title of Duke of Porto and the second infante (third son) was known as Duke of Beja.

There are examples of duke as a subsidiary title, granted to the most powerful noble houses:
* Duke of Barcelos, to be used by the heir of the Duke of Braganza;
* Duke of Torres Novas, to be used by the heir of the Duke of Aveiro;
* Duke of Miranda do Corvo, to be used by the heir of the Duke of Lafões.

Usually, the title of duke was granted to relatives of the royal family, such as the infantes or natural sons of the monarch. There are exceptions, such as António José de Ávila, who, although not having any relation to the royal family, was given the title of Duke of Ávila and Bolama in the 19th century.

==== Spain ====

Spanish infantes and infantas are usually given a royal dukedom upon marriage, excepting the heir apparent who is the Prince of Asturias. Those titles are nowadays not hereditary but carry a grandeeship of Spain. The current royal duchesses are Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria (although she inherited the title of Duchess of Hernani from her cousin and is the second holder of the title), and Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo. In Spain all dukes hold the court rank of grandee, which has precedence over all other noble titles.

The last non-royal hereditary dukedom created was the title of Duke of Suárez in favour of former primer minister Adolfo Suárez in 1981. Since the accession of King Felipe VI to the throne in 2014, no new noble title has been created.

=== Nordic countries ===
The Northern European duchies of Halland, Jutland, Lolland, Osilia and Reval existed in the Middle Ages. The longest-surviving duchy was Schleswig, i.e., &quot;Sonderjylland&quot; (a portion of which later became part of Germany). Its southern neighbor, the duchy of Holstein, in personal union with the Danish crown, was nonetheless always a German principality. The two duchies jointly became a member of the German &quot;Bundesland&quot; as &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; in the 19th century.

==== Denmark ====
Beginning in the 11th century, Danish kings frequently awarded the title of &quot;jarl&quot; (earl) or duke of Schleswig to a younger son of the monarch. Short-lived dukedoms were created for the same purpose in Lolland and Halland.

After the accession to the throne of Christian I, a complex system of appanages were created for male-line descendants of the king, being granted non-sovereign ducal titles in both Schleswig and Holstein, e.g. Duke of Gottorp, Duke of Sønderborg, Duke of Augustenborg, Duke of Franzhagen, Duke of Beck, Duke of Glücksburg and Duke of Nordborg. This arrangement occurred in both territories despite Schleswig being a fief of Denmark and Holstein being a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.

==== Finland ====
Key parts of Finland were sometimes under a Duke of Finland during the Swedish reign (until 1809). Some of the provinces are still considered duchies for the purposes of heraldry.

==== Norway ====
In Norway, Skule Bårdsson was first &quot;jarl&quot; in 1217, and as such got responsibility for the army, and then in 1237, as another attempt at compromise, Skule was given the first Norwegian title of duke (&quot;hertug&quot;). There is no indication that those two titles meant the same thing, or was mixed. He was first &quot;jarl&quot;, and then also &quot;hertug&quot;, but after he became &quot;hertug&quot; he kept the title &quot;jarl&quot;.

==== Sweden ====

Sweden has a history of making the sons of its kings ruling princes of vast duchies, but this ceased in 1622. Only one non-royal person was ever given a dukedom.

In 1772, King Gustav III reinstated the appointment of titular dukes but as a non-hereditary title for his brothers. Since then, all Swedish princes have been created dukes of a province at birth. When the 1810 Act of Succession was amended to allow female succession to the throne, King Carl XVI Gustaf&#x27;s eldest daughter Victoria became Crown Princess (displacing her younger brother Carl Philip) and received the title of Duchess of Västergötland. The practice of conferring ducal titles has since extended to Swedish princesses as well as princes. Currently, there are five dukes and four duchesses in their own right. The territorial designations of these dukedoms refer to ten of the Provinces of Sweden.

== France ==

The highest precedence in the realm, attached to a feudal territory, was given to the twelve original pairies (en: &quot;peers&quot;), who also had a traditional function in the royal coronation, comparable to the German imperial archoffices. 

Half of them were ducal: three ecclesiastical (the six prelates all ranked above the six secular peers of the realm) and three temporal, each time above three counts of the same social estate.

The &quot;Prince-Bishops&quot; with ducal territories among them were:
* The Archbishop of Reims, styled &quot;archevêque-duc pair de France&quot; (in Champagne; who crowns and anoints the king, traditionally in his cathedral)
* Two suffragan bishops, styled &quot;evêque-duc pair de France&quot; :
** the bishop-duke of Laon (in Picardy; bears the &#x27;Sainte Ampoule&#x27; containing the sacred ointment)
** the bishop-duc de Langres (in Burgundy; bears the scepter)
Later, the Archbishop of Paris was given the title of &quot;duc de Saint-Cloud&quot; with the dignity of peerage, but it was debated if he was an ecclesiastical peer or merely a bishop holding a lay peerage.

The secular dukes in the peerage of the realm were, again in order of precedence:
* The Duke of Burgundy or &quot;duc de Bourgogne&quot; (known as &quot;Grand duc&quot;; not a separate title at that time; just a description of the wealth and real clout of the 15th-century dukes, cousins of the kings of France) (bears the crown, fastens the belt)
* The Duke of Normandy or &quot;duc de Normandie &quot;(holds the first square banner)
* The Duke of Aquitaine or &quot;duc d&#x27;Aquitaine&quot; or &quot;de Guyenne&quot; (holds the second square banner)

The theory of the participation of the peers in the coronation was laid down in the late 13th century, when some of the peerage (the Duchy of Normandy and the County of Toulouse) had already been merged in the crown.

At the end of this same century, the king elevated some counties into duchies, a practice that increased up until the Revolution. Many of these duchies were also peerages (the so-called &#x27;new peerages&#x27;).

== Italy, Germany and Austria ==
In Northern Italy, Germany and Austria the title of &quot;duke&quot; (&quot;duca&quot; in Italian, and &quot;Herzog&quot; in German) was quite common. As the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) was until its dissolution a feudal structure, most of its Dukes were actually reigning in their lands. As the titles from the HRE were taken over after its dissolution, or in Northern Italy after their territories became independent of the Empire, both countries also had a share of fully sovereign dukes. Also, in Germany in many ducal families every agnate would bear the ducal title of the family as a courtesy title.

In Northern Italy some important sovereign ducal families were the Visconti and the Sforza, who ruled Milan; the Savoy in Piedmont; the Medici of Florence; the Farnese of Parma and Piacenza; the Cybo-Malaspina of Massa; the Gonzaga of Mantua; the Este of Modena and Ferrara.

In Germany, important ducal families were the Wittelsbachs in Bavaria, the Welfs in Hannover, the ducal family of Cleves, the Wettins in Saxony (with its Ernestine branch divided into several duchies), the Württembergs and the Mecklenburgs. In the German Confederation the Nassaus, the Ascanians of Anhalt, the Welf branch of Brunswick and the Ernestine lines of the Saxon duchies were the sovereign ducal families.

In Austria, &quot;Archduke&quot; was the title borne from 1358 by the Habsburg rulers of the Archduchy of Austria, and later by all senior members of that dynasty.

== Elsewhere in Europe ==

=== Hungary ===

In the Kingdom of Hungary no ducal principalities existed but duchies were often formed for members of the dynasty as appanages. During the rule of the Árpád dynasty dukes held territorial powers, some of them even minted coins, but later this title became more often nominal.
These duchies usually were
* the Duchy of Nitra
* the Duchy of Bihar
* the Duchy of Transylvania (consisting of the voivodship of Transylvania and some other counties)

In the Jagiellonian era (1490–1526) only two dukes did not belong to the royal dynasty: John Corvin (the illegitimate son of Matthias Corvinus) and Lőrinc Újlaki (whose father was the titular king of Bosnia), and both bore the title as royal dukes.

After the Battle of Mohács the Habsburg kings rewarded Hungarian aristocrats (like the Esterházys) with princely titles, but they created these titles as Holy Roman Emperors, not as kings of Hungary.

=== Greece ===
The Byzantines retained the title &quot;dux&quot;, transcribed as δούξ (&quot;doux&quot;) in Medieval Greek. As in the later Roman Empire, it remained a military office and was not a feudal or hereditary rank. In the 10th century, it was given to the military commanders over several &quot;themata&quot; (also known as &quot;katepano&quot;), and in the late 11th century it became used for the governor of a &quot;thema&quot;.

When the Catholic crusaders overran the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade, they installed several crusader states (see Frankokratia), some of which were of ducal rank:
* the Duchy of Athens, to which the Duchy of Neopatras was later linked
* the Aegean insular Duchy of Naxos, officially the &quot;Duchy of the Archipelago&quot;
* the Venetian colony of Crete (Candia) was initially ruled by the Duke of Candia

In Italy and other western countries, the later Byzantine appanages of the Palaiologan period were sometimes translated as duchies: the Morea, Mesembria, Selymbria and Thessaloniki. The Greek rank of their holders, however, was that of &quot;despotes&quot;.

In the independent Kingdom of Greece, the style of Duke of Sparta was instituted in 1868 upon the birth of the future Constantine I as a distinct title for the Crown Prince of Greece.

=== Slavic and nearby countries ===
Generally, confusion reigns whether to translate the usual ruler titles, &quot;knyaz/ knez/ książe&quot; etc. as Prince (analogous to the German Fürst) or as Duke;
* In splintered Poland petty principalities generally ruled by branches of the earlier Polish Piast dynasty are regarded as duchies in translated titulary. Examples of such: Kujavia, Masovia, Sandomir, Greater Poland and Kalisz as well as various minor duchies, often short-lived or in personal union or merger, named after their capitals, mainly in the regions known as Little Poland and Greater Poland, including (there are often also important Latin or German forms) Kraków, Łęczyca and Sieradz.
* In Pomerelia and Pomerania (inhabited by the Kashubians, different Slavic people from the Poles proper), branches of native ruling dynasties were usually recognized as dukes, quite similarly to the pattern in Poland.
* In Russia, before the imperial unification from Muscovy; sometimes even as vassal, tributary to a Tartar Khan; later, in Peter the Great&#x27;s autocratic empire, the russification gertsog was used as the Russian rendering of the German ducal title &quot;Herzog&quot;, especially as (the last) part of the full official style of the Russian Emperor: &quot;Gertsog Shlesvig-Golstinskiy, Stormarnskiy, Ditmarsenskiy I Oldenburgskiy I prochaya, I prochaya, i prochaya&quot; &quot;Duke of Schleswig-Holstein [see above], Stormarn, Dithmarschen and Oldenburg, and of other lands&quot;, in chief of German and Danish territories to which the Tsar was dynastically linked.
* In Bohemia was Duchy of Krumlov, and short-lived Duchy of Reichstadt and Duchy of Friedland.
* In Silesia were many petty duchies as Duchy of Brzeg, Duchy of Legnica, Duchy of Zator and Duchy of Racibórz. They were vassals of King of Bohemia.
*In Lithuania, the approximate equivalent of a duke or prince was called &quot;kunigaikštis&quot; in the Lithuanian language. Latin translation was &quot;dux&quot; meaning &quot;duke&quot; in the Middle Ages, whereas Latin for &quot;prince&quot; is &quot;princeps&quot;. The overall leader of the Lithuanian dukes (Lith. plural: &quot;kunigaikščiai&quot;) was the grand duke (Lith.: &quot;didysis kunigaikštis&quot;, Latin: &quot;magnus dux&quot;), who acted as the monarch of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until 1795 when Russians took over the land.

=== Netherlands ===
After Belgium and the Netherlands separated in 1830, the title of duke no longer existed in the Netherlands. There is, however, one exception; the title &quot;Hertog van Limburg&quot; (&quot;Duke of Limburg&quot;) still exists. This title, however, is an exclusive title for the head of state (the monarch, i.e., the king or queen of the Netherlands).

=== Georgia ===

In Georgia, the title of &quot;eristavi&quot; is equivalent to duke. The word means &quot;head of the nation&quot; or &quot;head of the army&quot;. A duke ruled a duchy (saeristavo); a duke of two or more duchies was called &quot;eristavt-eristavi&quot;, duke of dukes.

In the 6th to 9th centuries, Iberia was ruled by Erismtavari, a title similar to grand duke. Erismtavari was the first among equal dukes.

Georgians use the title &quot;eristavi&quot; only for Georgian dukes. When talking about foreign dukes, they use the German word &quot;Herzog&quot;, which is the German equivalent of &quot;duke&quot;.

In the late 15th and early 16th century, the kingdom of Georgia collapsed and most of the western Georgian dukes became princes. In the 19th century the title of &quot;eristavi&quot; was abolished by the Russian conquerors and the former dukes took the word &quot;Eristavi&quot; as their last names.

== Post-colonial non-European states ==

=== Empire of Brazil ===
In the Empire of Brazil duke was the highest rank for people born outside the imperial house and only three dukedoms were created. Two of these titles were for relatives of Emperor Pedro I: an illegitimate daughter and a brother-in-law who received the title when married to Pedro I&#x27;s daughter Maria II. The third, given to Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, was the only dukedom created during the reign of Pedro II. None of these titles were hereditary, just like every other title in the Brazilian nobility system.

=== Haiti ===
The royal Christophe dynasty created eight hereditary dukedoms, in rank directly below the nominal princes. They were short-lived and only recognized in the country.

== Analogues ==

Like other major Western noble titles, Duke is sometimes used to render (translate) certain titles in non-western languages. &quot;Duke&quot; is used even though those titles are generally etymologically and often historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered roughly equivalent, especially in hierarchic aristocracies such as feudal Japan, useful as an indication of relative rank.

=== Indian Subcontinent ===
The Indian feudal system cannot be fully translated to its European counterparts. The closest equivalent to the title of Sovereign Duke is Rao and Nawab to a feudal duchy, a large jagir. Thus, a Rao (in the ruling system) or a Jagirdar, Deshmukh, Patil, and Zamindar (in a feudal way) are closely equivalent to a Duke.

=== Turkey, Afghanistan and Iran ===
&quot;Duke&quot; in Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iran after Mongolian war against them, was added as generals and kings of districts or states. In the Kingdom of Persians and Ottomans, the systems cannot be fully translated to its European counterparts so they called those generals and kings as Khan, a Mongolian royal and noble rank from the Turco-Mongol word for &quot;lord&quot;, analogous to Duke. After revolutions and the falling Empire system in those countries (changing the ruling system to democratic and republic systems), those Khans and the other equal ranks titles added to the titleholder&#x27;s surnames, and the ranking system, as usual, was disqualified as an official ranking.

=== China ===
During the era of &quot;fengjian&quot; in Ancient China (Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period), the title of &quot;gōng&quot; (; sometimes translated as &quot;Duke&quot;, sometimes as &quot;Lord&quot;) was sparingly granted. Under the principle of &quot;Three Deferences and Two Royal Descendants&quot; (三恪二王後), the three former royal houses were granted the title of &quot;gōng&quot;; however, not all scholars recognize such a tradition in the Western Zhou dynasty. For that dynasty, this would be the descendants of the Xia dynasty and Shang dynasty; their dukedoms were respectively Qi (杞) and Song (宋). According to tradition, these states were considered the king&#x27;s guests rather than subjects. However, recent scholarship has identified multiple other meanings for &quot;gōng&quot;, including the patriarch of a lineage, a non-inheritable title signifying a very broad and senior position within the court, or a respectful appellation for any regional ruler or deceased ancestor.

In works like &quot;Mencius&quot; and others that date to the Warring States period, &quot;gōng&quot; was interpreted as the highest in the &quot;five ranks of nobles&quot; (五等爵) attributed to the Western Zhou dynasty. However, the title was not in use until the end of the Western Han, granted to the descendants of the Shang and Zhou royal houses and the eventual usurper Wang Mang. It was also granted to Cao Cao. The title during the Han was inferior to that of prince (諸侯王), which was only available to imperial princes. The &quot;five ranks of nobles&quot; were implemented as such during the Jin dynasty (晉朝). During the Southern dynasties, usurpers typically sought the title of duke, then prince, before compelling the monarch to abdicate.

The Duke of Yansheng noble title was granted to the descendants of Confucius. In 1935, the Nationalist Government changed the title to Sacrificial Official to Confucius (大成至聖先師奉祀官), which still exists as a hereditary office of the Republic of China.

The title &quot;gōng&quot; and others were also awarded, sometimes posthumously, during the imperial period of Chinese history to recognize distinguished civil and military officials. These could include a taxable base for the official, or could be purely honorary. For example, Emperor Lizong of Song granted the posthumous title Duke of Hui (徽國公) to the Neo-Confucian thinker Zhu Xi.

===Indonesia===
The Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, which dominated eastern Java in the 14th and 15th centuries, was divided into &quot;nagara&quot; (provinces). The administration of these &quot;nagara&quot; was entrusted to members of the royal family, who bore the title of &quot;Bhre&quot;—i.e., &quot;Bhra I&quot;, &quot;lord of&quot; (the word &quot;bhra&quot; being akin to the Thai &quot;Phra&quot;), followed by the name of the land they were entrusted with: for example, a sister of the king Hayam Wuruk ( 1350–1389) was &quot;Bhre Lasem&quot;, &quot;lady of Lasem&quot;. This system was similar to the Apanage system in Western Europe.

Sultan Agung, king of Mataram in Central Java ( 1613–1645), would entrust the administration of territories he gradually conquered all over the island of Java, to officials bearing the title of &quot;Adipati&quot;, this title is hereditary. Such territories were called &quot;Kadipaten&quot;. Prior to the unification of Java by Sultan Agung, independent &quot;kadipaten&quot;s also exist, e.g. the Duchy of Surabaya which was conquered by Agung in 1625.

The VOC (Dutch East Indies Company), while gradually taking control of Javanese territory, would maintain the existing Mataram administrative structure. &quot;Adipati&quot; were called &quot;&quot;regenten&quot; in Dutch, and the territories they administered, &quot;regentschappen&quot;&quot;.

In the 19th century, the Javanese term for &#x27;regent&#x27; was &quot;bupati&quot;. French traveller Gérard Louis Domeny de Rienzi mentions &quot;bapati&quot;.

The &quot;bupati&quot; have been maintained in the modern Indonesian administrative subdivision structure, heading a &quot;kabupaten&quot;, the subdivision of a &quot;provinsi&quot; or province.

The word &quot;Adipati&quot; is still found in the official title of the hereditary dukes Mangkunegara of Surakarta and Paku Alam of Yogyakarta—i.e., &quot;Kanjeng Gusti Pangeran Adipati Arya&quot; (shortened into KGPAA).

===Nigeria===
In the Kingdom of Benin, a viceroyal chieftain that is known as an &quot;Enogie&quot; in the Edo language is usually referred to as a duke in English. Often a cadet of the dynasty that produces the oba of Benin, the enogie is expected to rule his domain as he sees fit, subject to the approval of the oba.

In Ife, Oyo and the other kingdoms of Nigerian Yorubaland, a viceroyal chieftain is known as a &quot;Baale&quot; in the Yoruba language. He is barred from wearing a crown as a matter of tradition and is generally seen as the reigning representative of his oba, the monarch who has the right to wear one.

=== Myanmar ===

In Myanmar (Burma), since the Pagan era of 11th century, each and every single one of the royal family received the title of &quot;Myosa&quot; (also &quot;Myoza&quot;), literally means chief of town or territory, which is equivalent to the title of Duke. All royals were given the honor to possess at least one territory by the King. They all were mostly called by their possessions. For instance, Burma&#x27;s last king, King Thibaw was called by his possession, when he was a prince, of a town Thibaw (Hsipaw in Shan State).

<text>Waxes are a diverse class of organic compounds that are lipophilic, malleable solids near ambient temperatures. They include higher alkanes and lipids, typically with melting points above about 40 °C (104 °F), melting to give low viscosity liquids. Waxes are insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar organic solvents such as hexane, benzene and chloroform. Natural waxes of different types are produced by plants and animals and occur in petroleum.

== Chemistry ==

Waxes are organic compounds that characteristically consist of long aliphatic alkyl chains, although aromatic compounds may also be present. Natural waxes may contain unsaturated bonds and include various functional groups such as fatty acids, primary and secondary alcohols, ketones, aldehydes and fatty acid esters. Synthetic waxes often consist of homologous series of long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes or paraffins) that lack functional groups.

=== Plant and animal waxes ===
Waxes are synthesized by many plants and animals. Those of animal origin typically consist of wax esters derived from a variety of fatty acids and carboxylic alcohols. In waxes of plant origin, characteristic mixtures of unesterified hydrocarbons may predominate over esters. The composition depends not only on species, but also on geographic location of the organism.

==== Animal waxes ====
The best-known animal wax is beeswax, used in constructing the honeycombs of beehives, but other insects also secrete waxes. A major component of beeswax is myricyl palmitate which is an ester of triacontanol and palmitic acid. Its melting point is . Spermaceti occurs in large amounts in the head oil of the sperm whale. One of its main constituents is cetyl palmitate, another ester of a fatty acid and a fatty alcohol. Lanolin is a wax obtained from wool, consisting of esters of sterols.

==== Plant waxes ====

Plants secrete waxes into and on the surface of their cuticles as a way to control evaporation, wettability and hydration. The epicuticular waxes of plants are mixtures of substituted long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, alkyl esters, fatty acids, primary and secondary alcohols, diols, ketones and aldehydes. From the commercial perspective, the most important plant wax is carnauba wax, a hard wax obtained from the Brazilian palm &quot;Copernicia prunifera&quot;. Containing the ester myricyl cerotate, it has many applications, such as confectionery and other food coatings, car and furniture polish, floss coating, and surfboard wax. Other more specialized vegetable waxes include jojoba oil, candelilla wax and ouricury wax.

==== Modified plant and animal waxes ====
Plant and animal based waxes or oils can undergo selective chemical modifications to produce waxes with more desirable properties than are available in the unmodified starting material. This approach has relied on green chemistry approaches including olefin metathesis and enzymatic reactions and can be used to produce waxes from inexpensive starting materials like vegetable oils.

=== Petroleum derived waxes ===

Although many natural waxes contain esters, paraffin waxes are hydrocarbons, mixtures of alkanes usually in a homologous series of chain lengths. These materials represent a significant fraction of petroleum. They are refined by vacuum distillation. Paraffin waxes are mixtures of saturated n- and iso- alkanes, naphthenes, and alkyl- and naphthene-substituted aromatic compounds. A typical alkane paraffin wax chemical composition comprises hydrocarbons with the general formula C&quot;n&quot;H2&quot;n&quot;+2, such as hentriacontane, C31H64. The degree of branching has an important influence on the properties. Microcrystalline wax is a lesser produced petroleum based wax that contains higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons.

Millions of tons of paraffin waxes are produced annually. They are used in foods (such as chewing gum and cheese wrapping), in candles and cosmetics, as non-stick and waterproofing coatings and in polishes.

==== Montan wax ====

Montan wax is a fossilized wax extracted from coal and lignite. It is very hard, reflecting the high concentration of saturated fatty acids and alcohols. Although dark brown and odorous, they can be purified and bleached to give commercially useful products.

==== Polyethylene and related derivatives ====

, about 200 million kilograms of polyethylene waxes were consumed annually.

Polyethylene waxes are manufactured by one of three methods:

# The direct polymerization of ethylene, potentially including co-monomers;
# The thermal degradation of high molecular weight polyethylene resin;
# The recovery of low molecular weight fractions from high molecular weight resin production.

Each production technique generates products with slightly different properties. Key properties of low molecular weight polyethylene waxes are viscosity, density and melt point.

Polyethylene waxes produced by means of degradation or recovery from polyethylene resin streams contain very low molecular weight materials that must be removed to prevent volatilization and potential fire hazards during use. Polyethylene waxes manufactured by this method are usually stripped of low molecular weight fractions to yield a flash point &gt;500 °F (&gt;260 °C). Many polyethylene resin plants produce a low molecular weight stream often referred to as low polymer wax (LPW). LPW is unrefined and contains volatile oligomers, corrosive catalyst and may contain other foreign material and water. Refining of LPW to produce a polyethylene wax involves removal of oligomers and hazardous catalyst. Proper refining of LPW to produce polyethylene wax is especially important when being used in applications requiring FDA or other regulatory certification.

== Uses ==

Waxes are mainly consumed industrially as components of complex formulations, often for coatings. The main use of polyethylene and polypropylene waxes is in the formulation of colourants for plastics. Waxes confer matting effects (i.e., to confer non-glossy finishes) and wear resistance to paints. Polyethylene waxes are incorporated into inks in the form of dispersions to decrease friction. They are employed as release agents, find use as slip agents in furniture, and confer corrosion resistance.

=== Candles ===

Waxes such as paraffin wax or beeswax, and hard fats such as tallow are used to make candles, used for lighting and decoration. Another fuel type used in candle manufacturing includes soy. Soy wax is made by the hydrogenation process using soybean oil.

=== Wood products ===
Waxes are used as finishes and coatings for wood products. Beeswax is frequently used as a lubricant on drawer slides where wood to wood contact occurs.

=== Other uses ===
Sealing wax was used to close important documents in the Middle Ages. Wax tablets were used as writing surfaces. There were different types of wax in the Middle Ages, namely four kinds of wax (Ragusan, Montenegro, Byzantine, and Bulgarian), &quot;ordinary&quot; waxes from Spain, Poland, and Riga, unrefined waxes and colored waxes (red, white, and green). Waxes are used to make waxed paper, impregnating and coating paper and card to waterproof it or make it resistant to staining, or to modify its surface properties. Waxes are also used in shoe polishes, wood polishes, and automotive polishes, as mold release agents in mold making, as a coating for many cheeses, and to waterproof leather and fabric. Wax has been used since antiquity as a temporary, removable model in lost-wax casting of gold, silver and other materials.

Wax with colorful pigments added has been used as a medium in encaustic painting, and is used today in the manufacture of crayons, china markers and colored pencils. Carbon paper, used for making duplicate typewritten documents was coated with carbon black suspended in wax, typically montan wax, but has largely been superseded by photocopiers and computer printers. In another context, lipstick and mascara are blends of various fats and waxes colored with pigments, and both beeswax and lanolin are used in other cosmetics. Ski wax is used in skiing and snowboarding. Also, the sports of surfing and skateboarding often use wax to enhance the performance.

Some waxes are considered food-safe and are used to coat wooden cutting boards and other items that come into contact with food. Beeswax or coloured synthetic wax is used to decorate Easter eggs in Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and the Czech Republic. Paraffin wax is used in making chocolate covered sweets.

Wax is also used in wax bullets, which are used as simulation aids, and for wax sculpturing.

<text>A honeycomb is a mass of hexagonal prismatic cells built from beeswax by honey bees in their nests to contain their brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae) and stores of honey and pollen.

Beekeepers may remove the entire honeycomb to harvest honey. Honey bees consume about of honey to secrete of wax, and so beekeepers may return the wax to the hive after harvesting the honey to improve honey outputs. The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal honey extractor. If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused in a number of ways, including making sheets of comb foundation with a hexagonal pattern. Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells. Fresh, new comb is sometimes sold and used intact as comb honey, especially if the honey is being spread on bread rather than used in cooking or as a sweetener.

Broodcomb becomes dark over time, due to empty cocoons and shed larval skins embedded in the cells, alongside being walked over constantly by other bees, resulting in what is referred to as a &#x27;travel stain&#x27; by beekeepers when seen on frames of comb honey. Honeycomb in the &quot;supers&quot; that are not used for brood (e.g. by the placement of a queen excluder) stays light-colored.

Numerous wasps, especially Polistinae and Vespinae, construct hexagonal prism-packed combs made of paper instead of wax; in some species (such as &quot;Brachygastra mellifica&quot;), honey is stored in the nest, thus technically forming a paper honeycomb. However, the term &quot;honeycomb&quot; is not often used for such structures.

==Geometry==
The axes of honeycomb cells are always nearly horizontal, with the open end higher than the back end. The open end of a cell is typically referred to as the top of the cell, while the opposite end is called the bottom. The cells slope slightly upwards, between 9 and 14°, towards the open ends.

Two possible explanations exist as to why honeycomb is composed of hexagons rather than any other shape. First, the hexagonal tiling creates a partition with equal-sized cells, while minimizing the total perimeter of the cells. Known in geometry as the honeycomb conjecture, this was given by Jan Brożek and mathematically proven much later by Thomas Hales. Thus, a hexagonal structure uses the least material to create a lattice of cells within a given volume. A second reason, given by D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson, is that the shape simply results from the process of individual bees putting cells together: somewhat analogous to the boundary shapes created in a field of soap bubbles. In support of this, he notes that queen cells, which are constructed singly, are irregular and lumpy with no apparent attempt at efficiency.

The closed ends of the honeycomb cells are also an example of geometric efficiency, though three-dimensional. The ends are trihedral (i.e., composed of three planes) sections of rhombic dodecahedra, with the dihedral angles of all adjacent surfaces measuring 120°, the angle that minimizes surface area for a given volume. (The angle formed by the edges at the pyramidal apex, known as the tetrahedral angle, is approximately 109° 28&#x27; 16&quot; ()

The shape of the cells is such that two opposing honeycomb layers nest into each other, with each facet of the closed ends being shared by opposing cells.
Individual cells do not show this geometric perfection: in a regular comb, deviations of a few percent from the &quot;perfect&quot; hexagonal shape occur. In transition zones between the larger cells of drone comb and the smaller cells of worker comb, or when the bees encounter obstacles, the shapes are often distorted. Cells are also angled up about 13° from horizontal to prevent honey from dripping out.

In 1965, László Fejes Tóth discovered that the trihedral pyramidal shape (which is composed of three rhombi) used by the honeybee is not the theoretically optimal three-dimensional geometry. A cell end composed of two hexagons and two smaller rhombi would actually be .035% (or about one part per 2850) more efficient. This difference is too minute to measure on an actual honeycomb, and irrelevant to the hive economy in terms of efficient use of wax, considering wild comb varies considerably from any mathematical notion of &quot;ideal&quot; geometry.

===Role of wax temperature===
Bees use their antennae, mandibles and legs to manipulate the wax during comb construction, while actively warming the wax. During the construction of hexagonal cells, wax temperature is between , well below the temperature at which wax is assumed to be liquid for initiating new comb construction. The body temperature of bees is a factor for regulating an ideal wax temperature for building the comb.
