<text>Greta Garbo (born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson; 18 September 1905 – 15 April 1990) was a Swedish-American actress and a premier star during Hollywood&#x27;s silent and early golden eras.

Regarded as one of the greatest screen actresses of all time, she was known for her melancholic and somber screen persona, her film portrayals of tragic characters, and her subtle and understated performances. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Garbo fifth on its list of the greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema.

Garbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film &quot;The Saga of Gösta Berling&quot;. Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer, chief executive of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. She stirred interest with her first American silent film, &quot;Torrent&quot; (1926). Garbo&#x27;s performance in &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot; (1926), her third movie in the United States, made her an international star. In 1928, Garbo starred in &quot;A Woman of Affairs,&quot; which catapulted her to MGM&#x27;s highest box-office star, surpassing the long-reigning Lillian Gish. Other well-known Garbo films from the silent era are &quot;The Mysterious Lady&quot; (1928), &quot;The Single Standard&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1929).

With Garbo&#x27;s first sound film, &quot;Anna Christie&quot; (1930), MGM marketers enticed the public with the tagline &quot;Garbo talks!&quot; That same year she starred in &quot;Romance&quot; and for her performances in both films she received her first combined nomination out of three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. By 1932 her success allowed her to dictate the terms of her contracts and she became increasingly selective about her roles. She continued in films such as &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1931), &quot;Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)&quot; (1931), &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932), &quot;Queen Christina&quot; (1933), and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1935).

Many critics and film historians consider her performance as the doomed courtesan Marguerite Gautier in &quot;Camille&quot; (1936) to be her finest and the role gained her a third Academy Award nomination. However, Garbo&#x27;s career soon declined and she became one of many stars labelled box office poison in 1938. Her career revived with a turn to comedy in &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939), which earned her a fourth Academy Award nomination. &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941), a box-office flop, was the last of her 28 films. Following this commercial failure, she continued to be offered movie roles, though she declined most of them. Those she did accept failed to materialize, either due to lack of funds or because she dropped out during filming. In 1954, Garbo was awarded an Academy Honorary Award &quot;for her luminous and unforgettable screen performances&quot;.

Over time, Garbo would decline all opportunities to return to the screen. In her retirement, she shunned publicity, led a private life, and became an art collector whose paintings included works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pierre Bonnard and Kees van Dongen. Although she refused throughout her life to talk to friends about her reasons for retiring, four years before her death, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman: &quot;I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio ... I really wanted to live another life.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in Södermalm, Stockholm, Sweden at 7:30 pm. She was the third, and youngest, child of Anna Lovisa (née Karlsson, 1872–1944), who worked at a jam factory, and Karl Alfred Gustafsson (1871–1920), a laborer. She had an older brother, Sven Alfred (1898–1967), and an older sister, Alva Maria (1903–1926). Garbo was nicknamed Kata, the way she mispronounced her name, for the first ten years of her life.

Her parents met in Stockholm, where her father had been visiting from Frinnaryd. He moved to Stockholm to become independent and worked as a street cleaner, grocer, factory worker and butcher&#x27;s assistant. He married Anna, who moved from Högsby. The family was impoverished and lived in a three-bedroom cold-water flat at Blekingegatan No. 32. They raised their three children in a working-class district regarded as the city&#x27;s slum. Garbo later recalled:
Garbo was a shy daydreamer as a child. She disliked school and preferred to play alone. She was a natural leader who became interested in theatre at an early age. She directed her friends in make-believe games and performances, and dreamed of becoming an actress. Later, she would participate in amateur theatre with her friends and frequent the Mosebacke Theatre. At the age of 13, Garbo graduated from school, and, typical of a Swedish working-class girl at that time, she did not attend high school. She later acknowledged a resulting inferiority complex.

The Spanish flu spread throughout Stockholm in the winter of 1919 and her father, to whom she was very close, became ill and lost his job. Garbo cared for him, taking him to the hospital for weekly treatments. He died in 1920 when she was 14 years old.

==Career==
===1920–1924: Beginnings===

Garbo first worked as a soap-lather girl in a barber shop before taking a job in the PUB department store where she ran errands and worked in the millinery department. After modeling hats for the store&#x27;s catalogues, Garbo earned a more lucrative job as a fashion model at Nordiska Kompaniet. In 1920, a director of film commercials for the store cast Garbo in roles advertising women&#x27;s clothing. Her first commercial premiered on 12 December 1920 In 1922, Garbo caught the attention of director Erik Arthur Petschler, who gave her a part in his short comedy, &quot;Peter the Tramp&quot;.

From 1922 to 1924, she studied at the Royal Dramatic Training Academy in Stockholm. She was recruited in 1924 by the Finnish director Mauritz Stiller to play a principal part in his film &quot;The Saga of Gösta Berling&quot;, a dramatization of the famous novel by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf, which also featured the actor Lars Hanson. Stiller became her mentor, training her as a film actress and managing all aspects of her nascent career. She followed her role in &quot;Gösta Berling&quot; with a starring role in the German film &quot;Die freudlose Gasse&quot; (&quot;Joyless Street&quot; or &quot;The Street of Sorrow&quot;, 1925), directed by G. W. Pabst and co-starring Asta Nielsen. She praised Asta and said: &quot;In terms of expression and versatility, I am nothing to her.&quot;

Accounts differ on the circumstances of her first contract with Louis B. Mayer, at that time vice president and general manager of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Victor Seastrom, a respected Swedish director at MGM, was a friend of Stiller and encouraged Mayer to meet him on a trip to Berlin. There are two recent versions of what happened next. In one, Mayer, always looking for new talent, had done his research and was interested in Stiller. He made an offer, but Stiller demanded that Garbo be part of any contract, convinced that she would be an asset to his career. Mayer balked, but eventually agreed to a private viewing of &quot;Gösta Berling&quot;. He was immediately struck by Garbo&#x27;s magnetism and became more interested in her than in Stiller. &quot;It was her eyes,&quot; his daughter recalled him saying, &quot;I can make a star out of her.&quot; In the second version, Mayer had already seen &quot;Gösta Berling&quot; before his Berlin trip, and Garbo, not Stiller, was his primary interest. On the way to the screening, Mayer said to his daughter: &quot;This director is wonderful, but what we really ought to look at is the girl ... The girl, look at the girl!&quot; After the screening, his daughter reported, he was unwavering: &quot;I&#x27;ll take her without him. I&#x27;ll take her &quot;with&quot; him. Number one is the girl.&quot;

===1925–1929: Silent film stardom===
In 1925, Garbo, who was unable to speak English, was brought to Hollywood from Sweden at the request of Mayer. After a 10-day crossing on the in July, Garbo and Stiller arrived in New York where they remained for more than six months without word from MGM. They decided to travel to Los Angeles on their own but another five weeks passed without contact from the studio. On the verge of returning to Sweden, Garbo wrote her boyfriend back home, &quot;You&#x27;re quite right when you think I don&#x27;t feel at home here ... Oh, you lovely little Sweden, I promise that when I return to you, my sad face will smile as never before.&quot; A Swedish friend in Los Angeles helped by contacting MGM production boss Irving Thalberg, who agreed to give Garbo a screen test. According to author Frederick Sands, &quot;the result of the test was electrifying. Thalberg was impressed and began grooming the young actress the following day, arranging to fix her teeth, making sure she lost weight and giving her English lessons.&quot;

During her rise to stardom, film historian Mark Vieira notes, &quot;Thalberg decreed that henceforth, Garbo would play a young, but worldly wise, woman.&quot; However, according to Thalberg&#x27;s actress wife, Norma Shearer, Garbo did not necessarily agree with his ideas stating &quot;Miss Garbo at first didn&#x27;t like playing the exotic, the sophisticated, the woman of the world. She used to complain, &quot;Mr. Thalberg, I am just a young gur-rl!&quot; Irving tossed it off with a laugh. With those elegant pictures, he was creating the Garbo image&quot;. Although she expected to work with Stiller on her first film, she was cast in &quot;Torrent&quot; (1926), an adaptation of a novel by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, with director Monta Bell. She replaced Aileen Pringle, 10 years her senior, and played a peasant girl turned singer, opposite Ricardo Cortez. &quot;Torrent&quot; was a hit, and, despite its cool reception by the trade press, Garbo&#x27;s performance was well received.

Garbo&#x27;s success in her first American film led Thalberg to cast her in a similar role in &quot;The Temptress&quot; (1926), based on another Ibáñez novel. In this, her second film, she played opposite the popular star Antonio Moreno but was given top billing. Her mentor Stiller, who had persuaded her to take the part, was assigned to direct. For both Garbo (who did not want to play another vamp and did not like the script any more than she did the first one) and Stiller, &quot;The Temptress&quot; was a harrowing experience. Stiller, who spoke little English, had difficulty adapting to the studio system and did not get on with Moreno, was fired by Thalberg and replaced by Fred Niblo. Re-shooting &quot;The Temptress&quot; was expensive, and even though it became one of the top-grossing films of the 1926–1927 season, it was the only Garbo film of the period to lose money. However, Garbo received rave reviews, and MGM had a new star.
After her lightning ascent, Garbo made eight more silent films, and all were hits. She starred in three of them with the leading man John Gilbert. About their first movie, &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot; (1926), silent film expert Kevin Brownlow states that &quot;she gave a more erotic performance than Hollywood had ever seen.&quot; Their on-screen chemistry soon translated into an off-camera romance, and by the end of the production, they began living together. The film also marked a turning point in Garbo&#x27;s career. Vieira wrote: &quot;Audiences were mesmerized by her beauty and titillated by her love scenes with Gilbert. She was a sensation.&quot; Profits from her third movie with Gilbert, &quot;A Woman of Affairs&quot; (1928), catapulted her to top Metro star of the 1928–1929 box office season, usurping the long-reigned silent queen Lillian Gish. In 1929, reviewer Pierre de Rohan wrote in the &quot;New York Telegraph&quot;: &quot;She has glamour and fascination for both sexes which have never been equaled on the screen.&quot;

The impact of Garbo&#x27;s acting and screen presence quickly established her reputation as one of Hollywood&#x27;s greatest actresses. Film historian and critic David Denby argues that Garbo introduced a subtlety of expression to the art of silent acting and that its effect on audiences cannot be exaggerated. She &quot;lowers her head to look calculating or flutters her lips,&quot; he says. &quot;Her face darkens with a slight tightening around the eyes and mouth; she registers a passing idea with a contraction of her brows or a drooping of her lids. Worlds turned on her movements.&quot;

During this period, Garbo began to require unusual conditions during the shooting of her scenes. She prohibited visitors—including the studio brass—from her sets and demanded that black flats or screens surround her to prevent extras and technicians from watching her. When asked about these eccentric requirements, she said: &quot;If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.&quot;

Despite her status as a star of silent films, the studio feared that her Swedish accent might impair her work in sound, and delayed the shift for as long as possible. MGM itself was the last Hollywood studio to convert to sound, and Garbo&#x27;s last silent film, &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1929), was also the studio&#x27;s. Despite the fears, Garbo became one of the biggest box-office draws of the next decade.

===1930–1939: Transition to sound and continued success===

In late 1929, MGM cast Garbo in &quot;Anna Christie&quot; (1930), a film adaptation of the 1922 play by Eugene O&#x27;Neill, her first speaking role. The screenplay was adapted by Frances Marion, and the film was produced by Irving Thalberg and Paul Bern. Sixteen minutes into the film, she famously utters her first line, &quot;Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side, and don&#x27;t be stingy, baby.&quot; The film premiered in New York City on 21 February 1930, publicized with the catchphrase &quot;Garbo talks!&quot;, and was the highest-grossing film of the year. Her performance received positive reviews; Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that Garbo was &quot;even more interesting through being heard than she was in her mute portrayals. She reveals no nervousness before the microphone and her careful interpretation of Anna can scarcely be disputed.&quot; Garbo received her first Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for her performance, although she lost to MGM colleague Norma Shearer. Her nomination that year included her performance in &quot;Romance&quot; (1930). After filming ended, Garbo—along with a different director and cast—filmed a German-language version of &quot;Anna Christie&quot; that was released in December 1930. The film&#x27;s success certified Garbo&#x27;s successful transition to talkies. In her follow-up film, &quot;Romance&quot;, she portrayed an Italian opera star, opposite Lewis Stone. She was paired opposite Robert Montgomery in &quot;Inspiration&quot; (1931), and her profile was used to boost the career of the relatively unknown Clark Gable in &quot;Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)&quot; (1931). Although the films did not match Garbo&#x27;s success with her sound debut, she was ranked as the most popular female star in the United States in 1930 and 1931.

Garbo followed with two of her best-remembered roles. She played the World War I German spy in the lavish production of &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1931), opposite Ramón Novarro. When the film was released, it &quot;caused panic, with police reserves required to keep the waiting mob in order.&quot; The following year, she played a Russian ballerina in &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932), opposite an ensemble cast, including John Barrymore, Joan Crawford, and Wallace Beery, among others. The film won that year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Picture. Both films were MGM&#x27;s highest-earning films of 1931 and 1932, respectively, and Garbo was dubbed &quot;the greatest money-making machine ever put on screen&quot;. Garbo&#x27;s close friend Mercedes de Acosta then penned a screenplay for her to portray Joan of Arc, but MGM rebuffed the idea, and the project was shelved. By this time she had a fanatical worldwide following and the phenomenon of &quot;Garbomania&quot; reached its peak. After appearing in &quot;As You Desire Me&quot; (1932), the first of three films in which Garbo starred opposite Melvyn Douglas, her MGM contract expired, and she returned to Sweden.

After nearly a year of negotiations, Garbo agreed to renew her contract with MGM on the condition that she would star in &quot;Queen Christina&quot; (1933), and her salary would be increased to $300,000 per film. The film&#x27;s screenplay had been written by Salka Viertel; although reluctant to make the movie, MGM relented at Garbo&#x27;s insistence. For her leading man, MGM suggested Charles Boyer or Laurence Olivier, but Garbo rejected both, preferring her former co-star and lover John Gilbert. The studio balked at the idea of casting Gilbert, fearing his declining career would hurt the film&#x27;s box-office, but Garbo prevailed. &quot;Queen Christina&quot; was a lavish production, becoming one of the studio&#x27;s biggest productions at the time. Publicized as &quot;Garbo returns&quot;, the film premiered in December 1933 to positive reviews and box-office triumph and became the highest-grossing film of the year. The movie, however, met with controversy upon its release; censors objected to the scenes in which Garbo disguised herself as a man and kissed a female co-star.

Although her domestic popularity was undiminished in the early 1930s, high profits for Garbo&#x27;s films after &quot;Queen Christina&quot; depended on the foreign market for their success. The type of historical and melodramatic films she began to make on the advice of Viertel were highly successful abroad, but considerably less so in the United States. In the midst of the Great Depression, American screen audiences seemed to favor &quot;home-grown&quot; screen couples, such as Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. David O. Selznick wanted to cast Garbo as the dying heiress in &quot;Dark Victory&quot; (eventually released in 1939 with other leads), but she chose Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1935), in which she played another of her renowned roles. Her performance won her the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. The film was successful in international markets, and had better domestic rentals than MGM anticipated. Still, its profit was significantly diminished because of Garbo&#x27;s exorbitant salary.

Garbo selected George Cukor&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Camille&quot; (1936) as her next project. Thalberg cast her opposite Robert Taylor and former co-star, Lionel Barrymore. Cukor carefully crafted Garbo&#x27;s portrayal of Marguerite Gautier, a lower-class woman, who becomes the world-renowned mistress Camille. Production was marred, however, by the sudden death of Thalberg, then only thirty-seven, which plunged the Hollywood studios into a &quot;state of profound shock&quot;, writes David Bret. Garbo had grown close to Thalberg and his wife, Norma Shearer, and had often dropped by their house unannounced. Her grief for Thalberg, some believe, was more profound than for John Gilbert, who died earlier that same year. His death also added to the sombre mood required for the closing scenes of &quot;Camille&quot;. When the film premiered in New York on 12 December 1936, it became an international success, Garbo&#x27;s first major success in three years. She won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress for her performance, and she was nominated once more for an Academy Award. Garbo regarded &quot;Camille&quot; as her favorite out of all of her films.

Garbo&#x27;s follow-up project was Clarence Brown&#x27;s lavish production of &quot;Conquest&quot; (1937), opposite Charles Boyer. The plot was the dramatized romance between Napoleon and Marie Walewska. It was MGM&#x27;s biggest and most-publicized movie of its year, but upon its release, it became one of the studio&#x27;s biggest failures of the decade at the box office. When her contract expired soon thereafter, she returned briefly to Sweden. On 3 May 1938, Garbo was among the many stars—including Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Luise Rainer, Katharine Hepburn, Mae West, Marlene Dietrich, Fred Astaire, and Dolores del Río, among others—dubbed to be &quot;Box Office Poison&quot; in an article published by Harry Brandt on behalf of the Independent Theatre Owners of America.

After the box-office failure of &quot;Conquest&quot;, MGM decided a change of pace was needed to resurrect Garbo&#x27;s career. For her next movie, the studio teamed her with producer-director Ernst Lubitsch to film &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939), her first comedy. The film was one of the first Hollywood movies which, under the cover of a satirical, light romance, depicted the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin as being rigid and gray when compared to Paris in its pre-war years. &quot;Ninotchka&quot; premiered in October 1939, publicized with the catchphrase &quot;Garbo laughs!&quot;, commenting on the departure of Garbo&#x27;s serious and melancholy image as she transferred to comedy. Favoured by critics and box-office success in the United States and abroad, it was banned in the Soviet Union.

===1941–1948: Last work and retirement===

With George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941), MGM attempted to capitalize on Garbo&#x27;s success in &quot;Ninotchka&quot; by re-teaming her with Melvyn Douglas in another romantic comedy which sought to transform her into a chic, modern woman. She played a &quot;double&quot; role that featured her dancing the rhumba, swimming, and skiing. The film was a critical failure, but, contrary to popular belief, it performed reasonably well at the box office. Garbo referred to the film as &quot;my grave&quot;. &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; was her last film; she was thirty-six and had made 28 feature films in a span of 16 years.

Although Garbo felt humiliated by the negative reviews of &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot;, she did not intend to retire at first. But her films depended on the European market, and when it fell through because of the war, finding a vehicle was problematic for MGM. Garbo signed a one-picture deal in 1942 to make &quot;The Girl from Leningrad&quot;, but the project quickly dissolved. She still thought she would continue when the war was over, though she was ambivalent and indecisive about returning to the screen. Salka Viertel, Garbo&#x27;s close friend and collaborator, said in 1945: &quot;Greta is impatient to work. But on the other side, she&#x27;s afraid of it.&quot; Garbo also worried about her age. &quot;Time leaves traces on our small faces and bodies. It&#x27;s not the same anymore, being able to pull it off.&quot; George Cukor, director of &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot;, and often blamed for its failure, said: &quot;People often glibly say that the failure of &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; finished Garbo&#x27;s career. That&#x27;s a grotesque over-simplification. It certainly threw her, but I think that what really happened was that she just gave up. She didn&#x27;t want to go on.&quot;

Still, Garbo signed a contract in 1948 with producer Walter Wanger, who had produced &quot;Queen Christina&quot;, to shoot a picture based on Balzac&#x27;s &quot;La Duchesse de Langeais&quot;. Max Ophüls was slated to adapt and direct. She made several screen tests, learned the script, and arrived in Rome in the summer of 1949 to shoot the picture. However, the financing failed to materialize, and the project was abandoned. The screen tests—the last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camera—were thought to have been lost for 41 years until they were re-discovered in 1990 by film historians Leonard Maltin and Jeanine Basinger. Parts of the footage were included in the 2005 TCM documentary &quot;Garbo&quot;.

In 1949, she was offered the role of fictional silent-film star Norma Desmond in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, directed by &quot;Ninotchka&quot; co-writer Billy Wilder. However, after a meeting with film producer Charles Brackett, she insisted that she had no interest in the part whatsoever.

She was offered many roles both in the 1940s and throughout her retirement years but rejected all but a few of them. In the few instances when she did accept them, the slightest problem led her to drop out. Although she refused throughout her life to talk to friends about her reasons for retiring, four years before her death, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman: &quot;I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio ... I really wanted to live another life.&quot;

== Public persona ==
From the early days of her career, Garbo avoided industry social functions, preferring to spend her time alone or with friends. She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews. Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated. Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine, and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating, &quot;As early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I&#x27;ve always been moody. I detest crowds, I don&#x27;t like many people.&quot; The artist James Montgomery Flagg said in 1933 that when he was allowed to sketch Garbo at a director&#x27;s party in Hollywood some years earlier she told him she suffered from melancholia. At that time she had a Swedish phonograph record of laughs of all kinds which she played when visiting, to observe her hosts&#x27; response. In 1937, in a letter to her friend, Austrian actress and writer Salka Viertel, she wrote: &quot;I go nowhere, see no one... It is hard and sad to be alone, but sometimes it&#x27;s even more difficult to be with someone...&quot; In another letter in 1970 she wrote: &quot;I feel very tired and cannot seem to get myself together to plan where to go... I am sorry but something always seem to go a little wrong with me, and it is not in my head either...&quot;

Because Garbo was suspicious and mistrustful of the media, and often at odds with MGM executives, she spurned Hollywood&#x27;s publicity rules. She was routinely referred to by the press as the &quot;Swedish Sphinx&quot;. Her reticence and fear of strangers perpetuated the mystery and mystique she projected both on screen and in real life. MGM eventually capitalized on it, for it bolstered the image of the silent and reclusive woman of mystery. In spite of her strenuous efforts to avoid publicity, Garbo paradoxically became one of the twentieth century&#x27;s most publicized women. She is closely associated with a line from &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, one which the American Film Institute in 2005 voted the 30th-most memorable movie quote of all time, &quot;I want to be alone; I just want to be alone.&quot; The theme was a running gag in her movies that began during the silent period. According to a 1955 piece in LIFE magazine, Garbo explained that she&#x27;d said: &quot;I want to be &quot;let&quot; alone&quot;, not &quot;I want to be alone&quot;.

Fashion and personal style

After starring in &quot;Torrent&quot; (1926), she became known as &quot;the Art Deco Diva&quot;. She favored men&#x27;s shoes and clothes and her style has been described as &quot;trench coat, simple shoes, shirts, cigarette pants, slouch hat and big sunglasses.&quot; Garbo has been credited with popularizing the &quot;slouchy hat&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Retirement ===
In her retirement, Garbo generally led a private life of simplicity and leisure. She made no public appearances and assiduously avoided the publicity she loathed. Contrary to myth, from the beginning she had many friends and acquaintances with whom she socialized and travelled, although it has also been said that in later years she did not trust many people and therefore did not have many close friends. Her usual response to anyone asking her about a comeback was &quot;I have made enough faces&quot;, as she once said to David Niven.

Garbo was often perplexed about what to do and how to spend her time, always struggling with her many eccentricities and her life-long melancholy and moodiness. (&quot;Drifting&quot; was the word she frequently used; in 1946 she told reporters, &quot;I have no plans, either for the movies or anything else. I&#x27;m just drifting.&quot;) As she approached her sixtieth birthday in 1965, she told a frequent walking companion, &quot;In a few days, it will be the anniversary of the sorrow that never leaves me, that will never leave me for the rest of my life.&quot; She told another friend in 1971, &quot;I suppose I suffer from very deep depression.&quot; One biographer claims that she could have been bipolar. &quot;I am very happy one moment, the next there is nothing left for me&quot;, she said in 1933.

Beginning in the 1940s, Garbo became an art collector. Although many of the paintings she owned were of negligible monetary value, she also owned valuable works by Renoir, Rouault, Kandinsky, Bonnard and Jawlensky. Her art collection was worth millions of dollars when she died in 1990.

On 9 February 1951, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and bought a seven-room apartment at 450 East 52nd Street in Manhattan in 1953, where she lived for the rest of her life. Her New York apartment buzzer was identified by a solitary G and the interior was a &quot;light and airy study in pink&quot;. In order to protect her privacy, she preferred being addressed as &quot;Miss [Harriet] Brown&quot;. Her close friends were only allowed to call her Miss Garbo or G.G.; if they called her Greta, she wouldn&#x27;t respond.

Garbo was a dinner guest at the White House on 13 November 1963, just nine days before the assassination of President Kennedy. She spent the night at the Washington, D.C. home of philanthropist Florence Mahoney. Garbo&#x27;s niece reported that Garbo had always spoken of it as a &quot;magical evening&quot;.

Italian film director Luchino Visconti allegedly attempted to bring Garbo back to the screen in 1969 with the small part of Maria Sophia, Queen of Naples in his adaptation of Proust&#x27;s &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;. He exclaimed: &quot;I am very pleased with the idea that this woman, with her severe and authoritarian presence, should figure in the decadent and rarefied climate of the world described by Proust.&quot; Claims that Garbo was interested in the part cannot be substantiated.

In 1971, Garbo vacationed in Southern France at the summer home of her close friend Baroness Cécile de Rothschild who introduced her to Samuel Adams Green, an art collector and curator in New York City. Green became an important friend and walking companion. He was in the habit of tape-recording all of his telephone calls, including many of his conversations with Garbo. He did so with her permission, but Garbo ended the friendship in 1981 after being falsely told that Green had played the tapes to friends. In his last will and testament, Green bequeathed all of the tapes in 2011 to the film archives at Wesleyan University. The tapes reveal Garbo&#x27;s personality in later life, her sense of humor, and various eccentricities. In 1977, Garbo wrote to Frederick Sands: &quot;I am forever running away from something or somebody&quot;... &quot;Unconsciously I have always known that I was not destined for real and lasting happiness.&quot;

Although she was increasingly withdrawn in her final years, Garbo became close to her cook and housekeeper Claire Koger, who worked for her for 31 years. &quot;We were very close—like sisters,&quot; Koger said.

Throughout her life, Garbo was known for taking long daily walks with companions or by herself. In retirement, she walked the streets of New York City, dressed casually and wearing large sunglasses. &quot;Garbo-watching&quot; became a sport for photographers, the media, admirers, and curious New Yorkers, but she strictly maintained her privacy and her elusive mystique followed her to the end.

Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann, who was dubbed &quot;The New Greta Garbo&quot;, and played Anna Christie on Broadway in 1977, saw Garbo in the street and ran after her, in hopes of meeting her and telling her she was playing Anna Christie. Garbo ran away from her and disappeared into Central Park. Ullmann gave up the chase after she saw that Garbo looked &quot;frightened&quot;. She said: &quot;Yes, she outpaced me. But when she turned and looked so frightened I gave up and didn&#x27;t follow her. I was younger; I could have made it, but I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

=== Relationships ===
Garbo never married, had no children, and lived alone for most of her adult life. Her most famous romance was with her frequent MGM co-star John Gilbert, with whom she lived intermittently in 1926 and 1927. Soon after their romance began, Gilbert began helping her develop acting skills on the set and teaching her how to behave like a star, socialize at parties, and deal with studio bosses. They co-starred again in three more hits: &quot;Love&quot; (1927), &quot;A Woman of Affairs&quot; (1928), and &quot;Queen Christina&quot; (1933). Gilbert allegedly proposed to Garbo numerous times and she finally accepted, but backed out just before the wedding. &quot;I was in love with him,&quot; she said. &quot;But I froze. I was afraid he would tell me what to do and boss me. I always wanted to be the boss.&quot; In later years when asked about Gilbert, Garbo said &quot;I can&#x27;t remember what I ever saw in him.&quot; According to Ava Gardner&#x27;s autobiography, Garbo admitted to her that Gilbert was the only man she&#x27;d ever really loved but he had &quot;let [her] down&quot; by having a &quot;superstitious affair&quot; with &quot;a little extra&quot; during their last film and she had never forgiven him.

In 1937, Garbo met Leopold Stokowski, then conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, with whom she had a brief, but highly publicized relationship while the pair traveled throughout Europe the following year; whether the relationship was romantic or platonic is uncertain. In his diary, Erich Maria Remarque discusses a liaison with Garbo in 1941, and in his memoir, Cecil Beaton described an affair with her in 1947 and 1948. In 1941, she met the Russian-born millionaire George Schlee, who was introduced to her by his wife, fashion designer Valentina. Nicholas Turner, Garbo&#x27;s close friend for 33 years, said that, after she bought an apartment in the same building, &quot;Garbo moved in and took Schlee from Valentina right away.&quot; Schlee would divide his time between the two, becoming Garbo&#x27;s close companion and advisor until his death in 1964.

Garbo once said: &quot;If I were ever to love anyone, it would be Mauritz Stiller.&quot;

Recent biographers and others have speculated that because it can be assumed she had intimate relationships with women as well as men, Garbo was bisexual, possibly even &quot;predominantly lesbian&quot;. In 1927, Garbo was introduced to stage and screen actress Lilyan Tashman, and they may have had an affair, according to some writers. Silent film star Louise Brooks stated that she and Garbo had a brief liaison the following year.

In 1931, Garbo befriended the writer and acknowledged lesbian Mercedes de Acosta, whom she met through Salka Viertel, and, according to Garbo&#x27;s and de Acosta&#x27;s biographers, began a sporadic and volatile romance.
The two remained friends—with ups and downs—for almost 30 years, during which time Garbo wrote de Acosta 181 letters, cards, and telegrams, now at the Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library in Philadelphia. Garbo&#x27;s family, which controls her estate, has made only 87 of these items publicly available.

In 2005, Mimi Pollak&#x27;s estate released 60 letters Garbo had written to her in their long correspondence. Several letters suggest she may have had romantic feelings for Pollak for many years. After learning of Pollak&#x27;s pregnancy in 1930, for example, Garbo wrote: &quot;We cannot help our nature, as God has created it. But I have always thought you and I belonged together.&quot; In 1975, she wrote a poem about not being able to touch the hand of her friend with whom she might have been walking through life.

== Death ==

Garbo was successfully treated for breast cancer in 1984. Towards the end of her life, only Garbo&#x27;s closest friends knew she was receiving six-hour dialysis treatments three times a week at The Rogosin Institute in New York Hospital. A photograph appeared in the media in early 1990, showing Koger assisting Garbo, who was walking with a cane, into the hospital.

Garbo died on Easter Sunday, 15 April 1990, aged 84, in the hospital, as a result of pneumonia and renal failure. Daum later claimed that towards the end, she also suffered from gastrointestinal and periodontal ailments.

Garbo was cremated and her ashes were interred nine years later in 1999 at Skogskyrkogården Cemetery just south of her native Stockholm.

Garbo made numerous investments, primarily in stocks and bonds, and left her entire estate of $32million () to her niece.

== Legacy ==
Garbo was an international movie star during the late silent era and the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Hollywood who became a screen icon. For most of her career, Garbo was the highest-paid star at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, making her for many years the studio&#x27;s &quot;premier prestige star&quot;. After her death, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published an obituary calling her &quot;the most alluring, vibrant and yet aloof character to grace the motion-picture screen.&quot; The April 1990 &quot;Washington Post&quot; obituary said that &quot;at the peak of her popularity, she was a virtual cult figure.&quot;

Garbo possessed a subtlety and naturalism in her acting that set her apart from other actors and actresses of the period. About her work in silents, film critic Ty Burr said: &quot;This was a new kind of actor—not the stage actor who had to play to the far seats, but someone who could just look and with her eyes literally go from rage to sorrow in just a close-up.&quot;

Film historian Jeffrey Vance said that Garbo communicated her characters&#x27; innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and, most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters and the truth of the situation. &quot;She doesn&#x27;t act,&quot; said &quot;Camille&quot; co-star Rex O&#x27;Malley, &quot;she lives her roles.&quot; Clarence Brown, who directed seven of Garbo&#x27;s pictures, told an interviewer, &quot;Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn&#x27;t see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn&#x27;t have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes as she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has been able to do that on screen.&quot; Director George Sidney adds: &quot;You could call it underplaying, but in underplaying, she overplayed everyone else.&quot;

Many critics have said that few of Garbo&#x27;s 24 Hollywood films are artistically exceptional, and that many are simply bad. It has been said, however, that her commanding and magnetic performances usually overcome the weaknesses of plot and dialogue. As one biographer put it, &quot;All moviegoers demanded of a Garbo production was Greta Garbo.&quot;

Film historian Ephraim Katz: &quot;Of all the stars who have ever fired the imaginations of audiences, none has quite projected a magnetism and a mystique equal to Garbo. &#x27;The Divine&#x27;, the &#x27;dream princess of eternity&#x27;, the &#x27;Sarah Bernhardt of films&#x27;, are only a few of the superlatives writers used in describing her over the years ... She played heroines that were at once sensual and pure, superficial and profound, suffering and hopeful, world-weary and life-inspiring.&quot;

American film actress Bette Davis: &quot;Her instinct, her mastery over the machine, was pure witchcraft. I cannot analyze this woman&#x27;s acting. I only know that no one else so effectively worked in front of a camera.&quot;

Mexican film actress Dolores del Río: &quot;The most extraordinary woman (in art) that I have encountered in my life. It was as if she had diamonds in her bones and in her interior light struggled to come out through the pores of her skin.&quot;

American film director George Cukor: &quot;She had a talent that few actresses or actors possess. In close-ups, she gave the impression, the illusion of great movement. She would move her head just a little bit, and the whole screen would come alive, like a strong breeze that made itself felt.&quot;

American film actor Gregory Peck: &quot;If you ask me my favorite actress of all time, I will tell you that it is Greta Garbo. She shared her emotions with the camera and the audience. They were very truthful emotions. To my mind, she was an early practitioner of the Method. She felt everything she did and had the intelligence to go with it. ... And that is the key for the audience. If they believe it, then they&#x27;ve spent a couple of good hours at the cinema.&quot;

American film actress Kim Novak: &quot;You know, my idol, I idolize Greta Garbo. I just loved her work so much. She was, again, so real. She was not -- to me, she wasn&#x27;t stylized. You could see any of her work right now. She was just amazing, and what I loved about it also was there was an air of mystery about her work. There was always something more. She didn&#x27;t give you everything. She held back, and I like that. I probably -- she was my role model.&quot;

=== Documentary portrayals ===
Garbo is the subject of several documentaries, including four made in the United States between 1990 and 2005, and one made for the BBC in 1969:
* &quot;Garbo&quot; (1969), BBC, written by Alexander Walker (critic), narrated by Joan Crawford
* &quot;The Divine Garbo&quot; (1990), TNT, produced by Ellen M. Krass and Susan F. Walker, narrated by Glenn Close
* &quot;Greta Garbo: The Mysterious Lady&quot; (1998), Biography Channel, narrated by Peter Graves
* &quot;Greta Garbo: A Lone Star&quot; (2001), AMC
* &quot;Garbo&quot; (2005), TCM, directed by Kevin Brownlow, narrated by Julie Christie

=== In art and literature ===

Garbo has been memorialized in art and literature both during and after her life. Garbo was one of the subjects of French composer Charles Koechlin&#x27;s &quot;Seven Stars Symphony&quot; (1933), which consisted of seven movements, each dedicated to a Hollywood star.

Author Ernest Hemingway provided an imaginary portrayal of Garbo in his novel &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1940): &quot;Maybe it is like the dreams you have when someone you have seen in the cinema comes to your bed at night and is so kind and lovely ... He could remember Garbo still ... Maybe it was like those dreams the night before the attack on Pozoblanco, and [Garbo] was wearing a soft silky wool sweater when he put his arms around her, and when she leaned forward, and her hair swept forward and over his face, and she said why had he never told her that he loved her when she had loved him all this time? ... and it was as true as though it had happened ...&quot;

Garbo was portrayed by Betty Comden in the film &quot;Garbo Talks&quot; (1984). The plot concerns a dying Garbo fan (Anne Bancroft) whose last wish is to meet her idol. Her son (played by Ron Silver) diligently searches for the elusive Garbo, determined to fulfill his mother&#x27;s wish.

A statue of Greta Garbo titled &quot;Statue of Integrity&quot; by Jón Leifsson sits isolated deep in the forest in Härjedalen.

The Cole Porter song &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot; makes a passing reference to the importance of her salary. Garbo is mentioned in The Kinks&#x27; 1972 song &quot;Celluloid Heroes&quot; and the 1977 song &quot;Right Before Your Eyes&quot; by Ian Thomas, which was covered by America in 1982. Greta Garbo is mentioned in the 1981 Kim Carnes hit song &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; and she was the subject of the 1985 Freddie Mercury song, &quot;Living On My Own&quot;. The 1988 song, &quot;Garbo&quot; by Austrian musician Falco serves as a tribute in the form of a love song. In the 1990 song &quot;Vogue&quot; by Madonna, Greta Garbo is the first mentioned of a list of stars from Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age.

In 2023, notable artist William Kentridge included a drawing of Garbo in his solo museum exhibition at The Broad in Los Angeles.

Pornographic film director Peter de Rome shot footage of Garbo walking across First Avenue that he inserted into his 1974 feature &quot;Adam &amp; Yves.&quot; Its presence was explained by having one of the characters recalling how he once saw the elusive star. The Garbo footage was used without the star&#x27;s knowledge or permission, and she was not paid for her appearance.

== Awards and honors ==
Garbo was nominated four times for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1930, a performer could receive a single nomination for their work in more than one film. Garbo received her nomination for her work in both &quot;Anna Christie&quot; and for &quot;Romance&quot;.
She lost out to Irving Thalberg&#x27;s wife, Norma Shearer, who won for &quot;The Divorcee&quot;. In 1937, Garbo was nominated for &quot;Camille&quot;, but Luise Rainer won for &quot;The Good Earth&quot;. Finally, in 1939, Garbo was nominated for &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, but again came away empty-handed. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; swept the major awards, including Best Actress, which went to Vivien Leigh. In 1954, however, she was awarded an Academy Honorary Award &quot;for her luminous and unforgettable screen performances&quot;. Predictably, Garbo did not show up at the ceremony, and the statuette was mailed to her home address.

Garbo twice received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress: for &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; in 1935, and for &quot;Camille&quot; in 1936. She won the National Board of Review Best Acting Award for &quot;Camille&quot; in 1936; for &quot;Ninotchka&quot; in 1939; and for &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; in 1941. The Swedish royal medal Litteris et Artibus, which is awarded to people who have made important contributions to culture (especially music, dramatic art, or literature) was presented to Garbo in January 1937. In a 1950 &quot;Daily Variety&quot; opinion poll, Garbo was voted &quot;Best Actress of the Half Century&quot;, In 1957, she was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

In November 1983, she was made a Commander of the Swedish Order of the Polar Star by order of King Carl XVI Gustaf, the King of Sweden. In 1985, she was awarded the Illis quorum by the government of Sweden. In 1985, a star was nicknamed after her. For her contributions to cinema, in 1960, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard.

Garbo appears on a number of postage stamps, and in September 2005, the United States Postal Service and Swedish Posten jointly issued two commemorative stamps bearing her image.
On 6 April 2011, Sveriges Riksbank announced that Garbo&#x27;s portrait was to be featured on the 100-krona banknote, beginning in 2014–2015.

<text>Jack Tramiel ( ; born Idek Trzmiel; December 13, 1928 – April 8, 2012) was a Polish-American businessman and Holocaust survivor, best known for founding Commodore International. The Commodore PET, VIC-20, and Commodore 64 are some home computers produced while he was running the company. Tramiel later formed Atari Corporation after he purchased the remnants of the original Atari, Inc. from its parent company. He was one of six people spotlighted when the computer was denoted &quot;Machine of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1982.

==Early years==
Tramiel was born as &quot;Idek Trzmiel&quot; (some sources also list Juda Trzmiel, Jacek Trzmiel, or Idek Tramielski) into a Jewish family, the son of Abram Josef Trzmiel and Rifka Bentkowska.

After the German invasion of Poland in 1939 his family was transported by German occupiers to the Jewish ghetto in Łódź, where he worked in a garment factory. When the ghettos were liquidated, his family was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. He was examined by Josef Mengele and selected for a work party, after which he and his father were sent to the labor camp Ahlem near Hanover, while his mother remained at Auschwitz. Like many other inmates, his father was reported to have died of typhus in the work camp; however, Tramiel believed he was killed by an injection of gasoline. Tramiel was rescued from the labor camp in April 1945 by the 84th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.

On November 10, 1947, Tramiel immigrated to the United States. He soon joined the U.S. Army, where he learned how to repair office equipment, including typewriters.

==Commodore==
===Typewriters and calculators===
In 1953, while working as a taxi driver, Tramiel bought a shop in the Bronx to repair office machinery, securing a $25,000 loan for the business from a U.S. Army entitlement. He named it Commodore Portable Typewriter. Tramiel wanted a military-style name for his company, but names such as Admiral and General were already taken, so he settled on the Commodore name.

In 1956, Tramiel signed a deal with Czechoslovakian typewriter manufacturer Zbrojovka Brno NP to assemble and sell their typewriters in North America. However, as Czechoslovakia was part of the Warsaw Pact, they could not be imported directly into the U.S., so Tramiel used parts from Zbrojovka&#x27;s Consul typewriters and set up Commodore Business Machines in Toronto, Canada. After Zbrojovka began developing their own hardware Commodore signed an agreement in 1962 with Rheinmetall-Borsig AG and began to sell Commodore portable typewriters made from the parts of older Rheinmetall-Borsig typewriters. In 1962, Commodore went public, but the arrival of Japanese typewriters in the U.S. market made the selling of Czechoslovakian typewriters unprofitable. Struggling for cash, the company sold 17% of its stock to Canadian businessman Irving Gould, taking in $400,000 and using the money to re-launch the company in the adding machine business, which was profitable for a time before the Japanese entered that field as well. Stung twice by the same source, Gould suggested that Tramiel travel to Japan to learn why they were able to outcompete North Americans in their own local markets. It was during this trip that Tramiel saw the first digital calculators, and decided that the mechanical adding machine was a dead end.

When Commodore released its first calculators, combining an LED display from Bowmar and an integrated circuit from Texas Instruments (TI), it found a ready market. However, after slowly realizing the size of the market, TI decided to cut Commodore out of the middle, and released their own calculators at a price point below Commodore&#x27;s cost of just the chips. Gould once again rescued the company, injecting another $3 million, which allowed Commodore to purchase MOS Technology, Inc. an IC design and semiconductor manufacturer, a company which had also supplied Commodore with calculator ICs. When their lead designer, Chuck Peddle, told Tramiel that calculators were a dead end and computers were the future, Tramiel told him to build one to prove the point.

===Home computers===
Peddle responded with the Commodore PET, based on his company&#x27;s MOS Technology 6502 processor. It was first shown, privately, at the Chicago Consumer Electronics Show in 1977, and soon the company was receiving 50 calls a day from dealers wanting to sell the computer. The PET became a success—especially in the education field, where its all-in-one design was a major advantage. Much of their success with the PET came from the business decision to sell directly to large customers, instead of selling to them through a dealer network. The first PET computers were sold primarily in Europe, where Commodore had also introduced the first wave of digital handheld calculators.

As prices dropped and the market matured, the PET&#x27;s monochrome monitor (green text on black screen) was at a disadvantage in the market when compared to machines like the Apple II and Atari 8-bit computers, which offered color graphics and could be hooked to a television as an inexpensive display. Commodore responded with the VIC-20, and then the Commodore 64, which became the best-selling home computer of all time. The VIC-20 was the first computer to sell one million units. The Commodore 64 sold several million units. It was during this time that Tramiel coined the phrase, &quot;We need to build computers for the masses, not the classes.&quot; An industry executive attributed to Tramiel the discontinuation of the TI-99/4A home computer in 1983, after the company had lost hundreds of millions of dollars, stating that &quot;TI got suckered by Jack&quot;. By 1983 Commodore had $1 billion in annual revenue.

===Departure===
Gould had controlled the company since 1966. He and Tramiel often argued, but Gould usually let Tramiel run Commodore by himself. Tramiel was considered by many to be a micromanager who did not believe in budgets; he wanted to approve every expense greater than $1,000, which meant that operations stopped when Tramiel went on vacation. His management style made it difficult for Commodore to hire and keep executives, but was effective. Adam Osborne wrote in 1981:

Tramiel angrily left a January 13, 1984 meeting of Commodore&#x27;s board of directors led by chairman Gould, and never returned to the company. What happened at the board meeting remains unclear, but the departure surprised the industry because of Commodore&#x27;s great success against competitors. The press reported the poor relationship between Tramiel and Gould as the cause. Neil Harris, editor of &quot;Commodore Magazine&quot;, recalled:

Tramiel said that he had resigned from Commodore because he disagreed with Gould &quot;on the basic principles, how to run the company. And I felt that if I could not go into my office smiling, and being happy, I&#x27;d better quit&quot;. Their disagreement was so bitter that, after his departure, &quot;Commodore Magazine&quot; was forbidden to quote Tramiel or mention his name. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; wrote that although Tramiel&#x27;s &quot;obsession with controlling the cost of every phase of the manufacturing process&quot; had led to record profits during the home computer price war, his &quot;inflexible one-man rule&quot; had resulted in poor dealer relations and &quot;a steady turnover of top executives at Commodore&quot;. The magazine concluded &quot;it has become increasingly clear that the company is just too big for one man, however talented, to run&quot;.

During a question and answer session at CommVEx v11 (July 18, 2015), Jack&#x27;s son, Leonard Tramiel, stated that now that both Irving Gould and his dad Jack were both deceased, he could finally reveal to the crowd, what really transpired between Jack and Irving Gould resulting in Tramiel leaving Commodore: On January 13, 1984 during a meeting with Irving, Jack told Irving that treating the assets of the company as his own and using them for personal use was wrong. He said to Irving, &quot;you can&#x27;t do that while I&#x27;m still president&quot; to which Irving responded by saying &quot;Goodbye&quot;. Three days after the show, Jack announced to the public that he was resigning from the company.

Whilst acknowledging this description of events, David Pleasance (the eventual managing director of Commodore UK) also states that Gould told him the falling out was due to Tramiel&#x27;s insistence on his three sons joining the board.

In a 1986 interview with Dr. Achim Becker for the german newspaper DATA WELT, at the question &quot;Why did you leave Commodore? Is there a simple answer to this question?&quot; Jack Tramiel answered:If you ask the people who have worked with me, they will tell you that I have changed virtually nothing in the last 25 years. I&#x27;ve always been one of them. Just because we were a billion-dollar company, we didn&#x27;t have to throw money out the window like a billion-dollar company. Because, if you spend more, you have to raise prices. The man I worked for disagreed. When business was better, he wanted to spend more. That&#x27;s one of the points where we disagreed. We also disagreed on the issue of financing. I felt that the moment our stock was trading high, we should have issued new stock; especially since we had never had an increase since we went public in 1962. With the $120 million we would have earned from 2 million new shares, we could have paid all our debts to the banks and strengthened the company&#x27;s position. It would have allowed us to weather any storm without relying on the banks. The man I worked for thought this would dilute his share in the company and lose influence in the process - that was absolutely wrong. Those were the main reasons. In short, our philosophies were different. It got to the point where I said to him: Either I can run the company the way I think it should be run or I have to leave. I was told very kindly: If you don&#x27;t want to do it the way I do, then leave. And I left.

In an interview with &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine on April 13, 1998, Tramiel said &quot;Business is war, I don&#x27;t believe in compromising, I believe in winning.&quot;

==Atari==
After a short break from the computer industry, he formed a new company named Tramel Technology, Ltd., in order to design and sell a next-generation home computer. The company was named &quot;Tramel&quot; to help ensure that it would be pronounced correctly (i.e., &quot;tra – mel&quot; instead of &quot;tra – meal&quot;).

In July 1984, Tramel Technology bought the Consumer Division of Atari Inc. from Warner Communications. The division had fallen on hard times due to the video game crash of 1983. TTL was then renamed Atari Corporation, and went on to produce the 16-bit Atari ST computer line based on Motorola&#x27;s MC68000 CPU, directly competing with Apple&#x27;s Macintosh and Commodore&#x27;s Amiga, which also used the same CPU. Under Tramiel&#x27;s direction, the Atari ST was a considerable success in Europe, and globally in the professional music market.

Despite successfully shipping the ST, Tramiel&#x27;s poor personal reputation hurt Atari. One retailer said in 1985 about the ST that because of its prior experience with Tramiel &quot;Our interest in Atari is zero, zilch&quot;. A software company executive said &quot;Dealing with Commodore was like dealing with Attila the Hun. I don&#x27;t know if Tramiel will be following his old habits ... I don&#x27;t see a lot of people rushing to get software on the machine.&quot; (One ex-Commodore employee said that to Tramiel &quot;software wasn&#x27;t tangible—you couldn&#x27;t hold it, feel it, or touch it—so it wasn&#x27;t worth spending money for&quot;.) Steve Arnold of LucasArts said after meeting with Tramiel that he reminded him of Jabba the Hutt, while within Atari Darth Vader was often the comparison. Another executive was more positive, stating &quot;Jack Tramiel is a winner. I wouldn&#x27;t bet against him.&quot; In 1988 Stewart Alsop II called Tramiel and Alan Sugar &quot;the world&#x27;s two leading business-as-war entrepreneurs&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Tramiel decided to step away from day-to-day operations at Atari, naming his son, Sam, President and CEO. In 1995, Sam suffered a heart attack, and his father returned to oversee operations. In 1996, Tramiel sold Atari to disk-drive manufacturer Jugi Tandon Storage in a reverse merger deal. The newly merged company was named JTS Corporation, and Tramiel joined the JTS board.

==Later years==
Michael Tomczyk recalled that when Tramiel asked the German government for financial incentives for Commodore to take over a factory,

Tramiel was a co-founder of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which was opened in 1993. He was among many other survivors of the Ahlem labor camp who tracked down U.S. Army veteran Vernon Tott, who was among the 84th Division which rescued survivors from the camp and had taken and stored photographs of at least 16 of the survivors. Tott, who died of cancer in 2003, was personally commemorated by Tramiel with an inscription on one of the Holocaust Museum&#x27;s walls saying &quot;To Vernon W. Tott, My Liberator and Hero&quot;.

Tramiel retired in 1996 and moved to Monte Sereno, California. He died of heart failure on April 8, 2012, aged 83.

<text>Antoine Laurent de Jussieu (; 12 April 1748 – 17 September 1836) was a French botanist, notable as the first to publish a natural classification of flowering plants; much of his system remains in use today. His classification was based on an extended unpublished work by his uncle, the botanist Bernard de Jussieu.
== Life ==

Jussieu was born in Lyon, France, in 1748, as one of 10 children, to Christophle de Jussieu, an amateur botanist. His father&#x27;s three younger brothers were also botanists. He went to Paris in 1765 to be with his uncle Bernard and to study medicine, graduating with a doctorate in 1770, with a thesis on animal and vegetable physiology. His uncle introduced him to the Jardin du Roi, where he was appointed as a botany Demonstrator and deputy to L. G. Le Monnier, professor of botany there in 1770. Le Monnier had succeeded Antoine-Laurent&#x27;s uncle Antoine in 1759. Lectures by eminent botanists, including the Jusssieu dynasty were popular there, especially among pharmacists. His lecture on the classification of Ranunculaceae in 1773 to the Académie des Sciences led to his election as a member that year. In 1784 he was appointed to a Royal Commission by Louis XVI, as one of five commissionaires to investigate animal magnetism, publishing a dissenting opinion from the majority, suggesting further investigation was required.

The publication of Jussieu&#x27;s &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; in 1789 was rapidly followed by the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789–1799). Jussieu adhered to the revolutionary principles and was appointed to a position in the municipal government of Paris, where he had the task of managing all the hospitals. With the overthrow of the monarchy, the Jardin du Roi was renamed the Jardin des plantes, and Jussieu was instrumental in reorganizing the Jardin as the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle in 1790, where he became a professor of botany, holding the chair in Botanique à la campagne. He was also Director of the museum from 1794 to 1795, and again from 1798 to 1800. Jussieu immediately set about setting up a herbarium, a task greatly facilitated by the seizure of foreign collections by the revolutionary armies, and by the confiscation of the assets of the church and aristocracy. In 1808, Napoleon appointed him to the position of counsellor of the university.

He remained at the museum until 1826, when he was succeeded by his son Adrien-Henri. At the museum he published many papers in the museum&#x27;s annals (&quot;Annales du Museum d’histoire naturelle&quot; 1802–1813) and its succeeding &quot;Mémoires du Muséum d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot; (1815–), as well as contributing articles to Frederic Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire des sciences naturelles&quot; (1816-1830). He was also a member of the Masonic Lodge, Les Neuf Sœurs.

== Work ==

Jussieu&#x27;s system of plant classification, based on the relative value of their characteristics, served as the basis for natural systems of taxonomy. His system was first published in a paper on Ranunculaceae in 1773. The following year he developed the concept further in a paper on the arrangement of plants in the Jardin de Roi, based on the work of his uncle Bernard at the Trianon garden in Versaille. The work dealt primarily with suprafamilial ranks of classification. The following five years were devoted to applying his ideas to the entire plant kingdom, culminating in his epochal work, the &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; (1789). In preparing this work he had access to a large number of herbaria and botanical gardens. Although at first British and German botanists, firm adherents of the Linnaean system, were wary of what they considered radical ideas emanating from the French revolution, the work soon gained wide acceptance in scientific circles, and was actively promoted by eminent botanists including Robert Brown and A. P. de Candolle. 

In the &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; (1789), Jussieu adopted a methodology based on the use of multiple characters to define groups, an idea derived from naturalist Michel Adanson. This was a significant improvement over the &quot;artificial&quot; system of Linnaeus, whose most popular work classified plants into classes and orders based on the number of stamens and pistils, though Jussieu did keep Linnaeus&#x27; binomial nomenclature. He extended his uncle&#x27;s ideas about the value of the characteristics of plants. These characteristics were considered to be of unequal value, with some subordinate to others in a hierarchical system. As Jusssieu put it, plant characteristics should be &quot;pesés et non comptés&quot; (weighed, not counted), in assigning each to a definite group. The names he gave to his uncle&#x27;s three major groupings were Acotyledon, Monocotyledon, and Dicotyledon. These were then divided into fifteen classes and one hundred families. The most important features of the &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; are the division into groups and the description and circumscription of the 100 families (&quot;ordines naturales&quot;). With the resumption of his scientific work at the museum, Jussieu&#x27;s publications (some 60 memoirs) largely dealt with further elaborating the principles of the &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; and more detailed circumscription and description of the families he had named, work that was very much influenced by Joseph Gärtner. Although he worked on a second edition of &quot;Genera plantarum&quot;, all that was published was his &quot;Introductio&quot;, posthumously in 1837.

== Legacy ==

Jussieu&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; system of classification soon replaced the artificial sexual one of Linnaeus. The system of suprageneric nomenclature in botany is officially dated to 4 Aug 1789 with the publication of the &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; (Gen. Pl.). The &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; was far-reaching in its impact; many of the present-day plant families are still attributed to Jussieu. Morton&#x27;s 1981 &quot;History of botanical science&quot; counts 76 of Jussieu&#x27;s families conserved in the ICBN, versus just 11 for Linnaeus, for instance. Writing of the natural system, Sydney Howard Vines remarked: 

De Jussieu and his family have been commemorated by a number of images, including a bust and medallion by David d&#x27;Angers (Pierre-Jean David), upon his death. A statue of Jussieu, commissioned for 10,000 Fr by Jean-François Legendre-Héral in 1842, stands in the Galerie de Botanique of the Jardin des Plantes. Another, by Jean-Baptiste Gustave Deloye is on the balustrade of the Natural History Museum, Vienna (facing Maria-Theresien-Platz). The Jussieu botanical dynasty is commemorated in the neighbourhood of the Jardin des Plantes by the Place Jussieu, (Quartier Saint-Victor, 5th arrondissement) Rue Jussieu, the Jussieu metro station and the Jussieu science campus of the University of Paris. The Jussieu family are also commemorated by street names in Marseille and Lyon, their family home. The Jussieu Peninsula in South Australia is also named after Antoine Laurent Jussieu, as is an asteroid.

<doc id="63444" wikidata="Q164061" url="?curid=63444" title="Helen of Troy">
<text>Helen (), also known as Helen of Troy, or Helen of Sparta, and in Latin as Helena, was a figure in Greek mythology said to have been the most beautiful woman in the world. She was believed to have been the daughter of Zeus and Leda or Nemesis, and the sister of Clytemnestra, Castor, Pollux, Philonoe, Phoebe and Timandra. She was married first to King Menelaus of Sparta &quot;who became by her the father of Hermione, and, according to others, of Nicostratus also.&quot; Her subsequent marriage to Paris of Troy was the most immediate cause of the Trojan War.

Elements of her putative biography come from classical authors such as Aristophanes, Cicero, Euripides, and Homer (in both the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;). Her story reappears in Book II of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. In her youth, she was abducted by Theseus. A competition between her suitors for her hand in marriage saw Menelaus emerge victorious. All of her suitors were required to swear an oath (known as the &quot;Oath of Tyndareus&quot;) promising to provide military assistance to the winning suitor, if Helen were ever stolen from him. The obligations of the oath precipitated the Trojan War. When she married Menelaus she was still very young. In most accounts, including Homer&#x27;s, Helen ultimately fell in love with Paris and willingly went to Troy with him, though there are also stories she was abducted by force.

The legends of Helen during her time in Troy are contradictory: Homer depicts her ambivalently, both regretful of her choice and sly in her attempts to redeem her public image. Other accounts have a treacherous Helen who simulated Bacchic rites and rejoiced in the carnage she caused. In some versions, Helen does not arrive in Troy, but instead waits out the war in Egypt. Ultimately, Paris was killed in action, and in Homer&#x27;s account Helen was reunited with Menelaus, though other versions of the legend recount her ascending to Olympus instead. A cult associated with her developed in Hellenistic Laconia, both at Sparta and elsewhere; at Therapne she shared a shrine with Menelaus. She was also worshiped in Attica and on Rhodes.

Her beauty inspired artists of all times to represent her, frequently as the personification of ideal human beauty. Images of Helen start appearing in the 7th century BC. In classical Greece, her elopement — or abduction — was a popular motif. In medieval illustrations, this event was frequently portrayed as a seduction, whereas in Renaissance paintings it was usually depicted as a &quot;rape&quot; (i. e., a &quot;forced abduction&quot;) by Paris. Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s lines from his tragedy &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1604) are frequently cited: &quot;Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?&quot;

== Etymology ==

The etymology of Helen&#x27;s name continues to be a problem for scholars. In the 19th century, Georg Curtius related &quot;Helen&quot; () to the moon (Selene; ). But two early dedications to Helen in the Laconian dialect of ancient Greek spell her name with an initial digamma (Ϝ, probably pronounced like a w), which rules out any etymology originally starting with simple &quot;*s-&quot;.

In the early 20th century, Émile Boisacq considered Ἑλένη to derive from the well-known noun meaning &quot;torch&quot;. It has also been suggested that the λ of arose from an original ν, and thus the etymology of the name would be connected with the root of &quot;Venus&quot;. Linda Lee Clader, however, says that none of the above suggestions offers much satisfaction.

More recently, Otto Skutsch has advanced the theory that the name Helen might have two separate etymologies, which belong to different mythological figures respectively, namely &quot;*Sṷelenā&quot; (related to Sanskrit &quot;svaraṇā&quot; &quot;the shining one&quot;) and &quot;*Selenā&quot;, the first a Spartan goddess, connected to one or the other natural light phenomenon (especially St. Elmo&#x27;s fire) and sister of the Dioscuri, the other a vegetation goddess worshiped in Therapne as Ἑλένα Δενδρῖτις (&quot;Helena of the Trees&quot;).

Others have connected the name&#x27;s etymology to a hypothetical Proto-Indo-European sun goddess, noting the name&#x27;s connection to the word for &quot;sun&quot; in various Indo-European cultures including the Greek proper word and god for the sun, Helios. In particular, her marriage myth may be connected to a broader Indo-European &quot;marriage drama&quot; of the sun goddess, and she is related to the divine twins, just as many of these goddesses are. Martin L. West has thus proposed that &quot;Helena&quot; (&quot;mistress of sunlight&quot;) may be constructed on the PIE suffix &quot;-nā&quot; (&quot;mistress of&quot;), connoting a deity controlling a natural element.

== Prehistoric and mythological context ==
Helen first appears in the poems of Homer, after which she became a popular figure in Greek literature. These works are set in the final years of the Age of Heroes, a mythological era which features prominently in the canon of Greek myth. Because the Homeric poems are known to have been transmitted orally before being written down, some scholars speculate that such stories were passed down from earlier Mycenaean Greek tradition, and that the Age of Heroes may itself reflect a mythologized memory of that era.

Recent archaeological excavations in Greece suggest that modern-day Laconia was a distinct territory in the Late Bronze Age, while the poets narrate that it was a rich kingdom. Archaeologists have unsuccessfully looked for a Mycenaean palatial complex buried beneath present-day Sparta. Modern findings suggest the area around Menelaion in the southern part of the Eurotas valley seems to have been the center of Mycenaean Laconia.

== Family ==
Helen and Menelaus had a daughter, Hermione. Hesiod says she was &quot;a child unlooked for,&quot; and Homer writes she was Helen&#x27;s first and only child. Different sources say she was also the mother of one or more sons, named Aethiolas, Nicostratus, Megapenthes and Pleisthenes. Still, according to others, these were instead illegitimate children of Menelaus and various lovers.

According to other sources that also contradict Homer, Helen and Paris had three sons, Bunomus, Aganus, Idaeus, and a daughter also called Helen. The three sons died during the Trojan War when an earthquake caused the roof of the room where they slept to collapse.

== Mythology ==
=== Birth ===
In most sources, including the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Helen is the daughter of Zeus and of Leda, the wife of the Spartan king Tyndareus. Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Helen&quot;, written in the late 5th century BC, is the earliest source to report the most familiar account of Helen&#x27;s birth: that, although her putative father was Tyndareus, she was actually Zeus&#x27; daughter. In the form of a swan, the king of gods was chased by an eagle, and sought refuge with Leda. The swan gained her affection, and the two mated. Leda then produced an egg, from which Helen emerged. The First Vatican Mythographer introduces the notion that two eggs came from the union: one containing Castor and Pollux; one with Helen and Clytemnestra. Nevertheless, the same author earlier states that Helen, Castor and Pollux were produced from a single egg. Fabius Planciades Fulgentius also states that Helen, Castor and Pollux are born from the same egg. Pseudo-Apollodorus states that Leda had intercourse with both Zeus and Tyndareus the night she conceived Helen.

On the other hand, in the &quot;Cypria&quot;, part of the Epic Cycle, Helen was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Nemesis. The date of the &quot;Cypria&quot; is uncertain, but it is generally thought to preserve traditions that date back to at least the 7th century BC. In the &quot;Cypria&quot;, Nemesis did not wish to mate with Zeus. She therefore changed shape into various animals as she attempted to flee Zeus, finally becoming a goose. Zeus also transformed himself into a goose and raped Nemesis, who produced an egg from which Helen was born. Presumably, in the &quot;Cypria&quot;, this egg was somehow transferred to Leda. Later sources state either that it was brought to Leda by a shepherd who discovered it in a grove in Attica, or that it was dropped into her lap by Hermes.

Asclepiades of Tragilos and Pseudo-Eratosthenes related a similar story, except that Zeus and Nemesis became swans instead of geese. Timothy Gantz has suggested that the tradition that Zeus came to Leda in the form of a swan derives from the version in which Zeus and Nemesis transformed into birds.

Pausanias states that in the middle of the 2nd century AD, the remains of an egg-shell, tied up in ribbons, were still suspended from the roof of a temple on the Spartan acropolis. People believed that this was &quot;the famous egg that legend says Leda brought forth&quot;. Pausanias traveled to Sparta to visit the sanctuary, dedicated to Hilaeira and Phoebe, in order to see the relic for himself.

Pausanias also says that there was a local tradition that Helen&#x27;s brothers, &quot;the Dioscuri&quot; (i.e. Castor and Pollux), were born on the island of Pefnos, adding that the Spartan poet Alcman also said this, while the poet Lycophron&#x27;s use of the adjective &quot;Pephnaian&quot; (&quot;Πεφναίας&quot;) in association with Helen, suggests that Lycophron may have known a tradition which held that Helen was also born on the island.

=== Youthful abduction by Theseus ===

Two Athenians, Theseus and Pirithous, thought that since they were sons of gods, they should have divine wives; they thus pledged to help each other abduct two daughters of Zeus. Theseus chose Helen, and Pirithous vowed to marry Persephone, the wife of Hades. Theseus took Helen and left her with his mother Aethra or his associate Aphidnus at Aphidnae or Athens. Theseus and Pirithous then traveled to the underworld, the domain of Hades, to kidnap Persephone. Hades pretended to offer them hospitality and set a feast, but, as soon as the pair sat down, snakes coiled around their feet and held them there. Helen&#x27;s abduction caused an invasion of Athens by Castor and Pollux, who captured Aethra in revenge, and returned their sister to Sparta. In Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, Centaur Chiron is said to have aided the Dioscuri brothers in returning Helen home.

In most accounts of this event, Helen was quite young; Hellanicus of Lesbos said she was seven years old and Diodorus makes her ten years old. On the other hand, Stesichorus said that Iphigenia was the daughter of Theseus and Helen, which implies that Helen was of childbearing age. In most sources, Iphigenia is the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, but Duris of Samos and other writers, such as Antoninus Liberalis, followed Stesichorus&#x27; account.

Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot; give us an idea of how ancient and, in particular, Roman authors imagined Helen in her youth: she is presented as a young princess wrestling naked in the palaestra, alluding to a part of girls&#x27; physical education in classical (not Mycenaean) Sparta. Sextus Propertius imagines Helen as a girl who practices arms and hunts with her brothers:
=== Suitors ===

When it was time for Helen to marry, many kings and princes from around the world came to seek her hand, bringing rich gifts with them or sent emissaries to do so on their behalf. During the contest, Castor and Pollux had a prominent role in dealing with the suitors, although the final decision was in the hands of Tyndareus. Menelaus, her future husband, did not attend but sent his brother, Agamemnon, to represent him. He was chosen as he had the most wealth.

=== Oath of Tyndareus ===
Tyndareus was afraid to select a husband for his daughter, or send any of the suitors away, for fear of offending them and giving grounds for a quarrel. Odysseus was one of the suitors, but had brought no gifts because he believed he had little chance to win the contest. He thus promised to solve the problem, if Tyndareus in turn would support him in his courting of Penelope, the daughter of Icarius. Tyndareus readily agreed, and Odysseus proposed that, before the decision was made, all the suitors should swear a most solemn oath to defend the chosen husband against whoever should quarrel with him. After the suitors had sworn not to retaliate, Menelaus was chosen to be Helen&#x27;s husband because he was the &quot;greatest in possessions&quot; and had offered the most gifts. As a sign of the importance of the pact, Tyndareus sacrificed a horse. Helen and Menelaus became rulers of Sparta, after Tyndareus and Leda abdicated. Menelaus and Helen rule in Sparta for at least ten years; they have a daughter, Hermione, and (according to some myths) three sons: Aethiolas, Maraphius, and Pleisthenes.

The marriage of Helen and Menelaus marks the beginning of the end of the age of heroes. Concluding the catalog of Helen&#x27;s suitors, Hesiod reports Zeus&#x27; plan to obliterate the race of men and the heroes in particular. The Trojan War, caused by Helen&#x27;s elopement with Paris, is going to be his means to this end.

=== Seduction or kidnapping by Paris ===
Paris, a Trojan prince, came to Sparta to claim Helen, in the guise of a supposed diplomatic mission. Before this journey, Paris had been appointed by Zeus to judge the most beautiful goddess; Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite. In order to earn his favour, Aphrodite promised Paris the most beautiful woman in the world. Swayed by Aphrodite&#x27;s offer, Paris chose her as the most beautiful of the goddesses, earning the wrath of Athena and Hera.

Although Helen is sometimes depicted as being forcibly abducted by Paris, most Ancient Greek sources, following Homer, believed that Helen fell in love with the Trojan prince, and went to Troy willingly. In Homer, Helen herself says she followed Paris, or that she was led to Troy by Aphrodite. Herodotus, who says Paris &quot;carried off&quot; (&quot;ἁρπάσαντος&quot;) Helen, says Paris &quot;got her to fly&quot; with him. The &quot;Cypria&quot; simply mentions that after giving Helen gifts, &quot;Aphrodite brings the Spartan queen together with the Prince of Troy.&quot; Apollodorus says Paris persuaded Helen to leave with him, and Sappho argues that Helen willingly left behind Menelaus and their nine-year-old daughter, Hermione, to be with Paris:
Dio Chrysostom gives a completely different account of the story, questioning Homer&#x27;s credibility: after Agamemnon had married Helen&#x27;s sister, Clytemnestra, Tyndareus sought Helen&#x27;s hand for Menelaus for political reasons. However, Helen was sought by many suitors, who came from far and near, among them Paris who surpassed all the others and won the favor of Tyndareus and his sons. Thus he won her fairly and took her away to Troia, with the full consent of her natural protectors. &quot;Cypria&quot; narrate that in just three days Paris and Helen reached Troy. Homer narrates that during a brief stop-over in the small island of Kranai, according to &quot;Iliad&quot;, the two lovers consummated their passion. On the other hand, &quot;Cypria&quot; note that this happened the night before they left Sparta.

In her book &quot;Helen of Troy: Myth, Beauty, Devastation&quot;, Ruby Blondell posits, &quot;Though [Helen&#x27;s] departure is typically referred to as an &#x27;abduction&#x27;, none of our sources claims that Paris took Helen by force against her will. Her complicity is essential to her story&quot;.

=== In Egypt ===
At least three Ancient Greek authors denied that Helen ever went to Troy; instead, they suggested, Helen stayed in Egypt during the Trojan War. Those three authors are Euripides, Stesichorus, and Herodotus. In the version put forth by Euripides in his play &quot;Helen&quot;, Hera fashioned a likeness (&quot;eidolon&quot;, εἴδωλον) of Helen out of clouds at Zeus&#x27; request, Hermes took her to Egypt, and Helen never went to Troy, but instead spent the entire war in Egypt. An &quot;eidolon&quot; is also present in Stesichorus&#x27; account, but not in Herodotus&#x27; rationalizing version of the myth. In addition to these accounts, Lycophron (822) states that Hesiod was the first to mention Helen&#x27;s &quot;eidolon&quot;. This may mean Hesiod stated this in a literary work, or that the idea was widely known/circulated in early archaic Greece during the time of Hesiod and was consequently attributed to him.

Herodotus adds weight to the &quot;Egyptian&quot; version of events by putting forward his own evidence—he traveled to Egypt and interviewed the priests of the temple (&quot;Foreign Aphrodite&quot;, ξείνη Ἀφροδίτη) at Memphis. According to these priests, Helen had arrived in Egypt shortly after leaving Sparta, because strong winds had blown Paris&#x27;s ship off course. King Proteus of Egypt, appalled that Paris had seduced his host&#x27;s wife and plundered his host&#x27;s home in Sparta, disallowed Paris from taking Helen to Troy. Paris returned to Troy without a new bride, but the Greeks refused to believe that Helen was in Egypt and not within Troy&#x27;s walls. Thus, Helen waited in Memphis for ten years, while the Greeks and the Trojans fought. Following the conclusion of the Trojan War, Menelaus sailed to Memphis, where Proteus reunited him with Helen.

=== In Troy ===
When he discovered that his wife was missing, Menelaus called upon all the other suitors to fulfill their oaths, thus beginning the Trojan War.

The Greek fleet gathered in Aulis, but the ships could not sail for lack of wind. Artemis was enraged by a sacrilege, and only the sacrifice of Agamemnon&#x27;s daughter, Iphigenia, could appease her. In Euripides &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot;, Clytemnestra, Iphigenia&#x27;s mother and Helen&#x27;s sister, begs her husband to reconsider his decision, calling Helen a &quot;wicked woman&quot;. Clytemnestra tries to warn Agamemnon that sacrificing Iphigenia for Helen&#x27;s sake is, &quot;buying what we most detest with what we hold most dear&quot;.

Before the opening of hostilities, the Greeks dispatched a delegation to the Trojans under Odysseus and Menelaus; they endeavored without success to persuade Priam to hand Helen back. A popular theme, &quot;The Request of Helen&quot; (Helenes Apaitesis, Ἑλένης Ἀπαίτησις), was the subject of a drama by Sophocles, now lost.

Homer paints a poignant, lonely picture of Helen in Troy. She is filled with self-loathing and regret for what she has caused; by the end of the war, the Trojans have come to hate her. When Hector dies, she is the third mourner at his funeral, and she says that, of all the Trojans, Hector and Priam alone were always kind to her:
These bitter words reveal that Helen gradually realized Paris&#x27; weaknesses, and decided to ally herself with Hector. There is an affectionate relationship between the two, and Helen has harsh words for Paris when she compares the two brothers:

After Paris was killed in combat, there was some dispute among the Trojans about which of Priam&#x27;s surviving sons she should remarry: Helenus or Deiphobus, but she was given to the latter.

=== During the Fall of Troy ===

During the fall of Troy, Helen&#x27;s role is ambiguous. In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Deiphobus gives an account of Helen&#x27;s treacherous stance: when the Trojan Horse was admitted into the city, she feigned Bacchic rites, leading a chorus of Trojan women, and, holding a torch among them, she signaled to the Greeks from the city&#x27;s central tower. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, however, Homer narrates a different story: Helen circled the Horse three times, and she imitated the voices of the Greek women left behind at home—she thus tortured the men inside (including Odysseus and Menelaus) with the memory of their loved ones, and brought them to the brink of destruction.

After the deaths of Hector and Paris, Helen became the paramour of their younger brother, Deiphobus; but when the sack of Troy began, she hid her new husband&#x27;s sword, and left him to the mercy of Menelaus and Odysseus. In &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Aeneas meets the mutilated Deiphobus in Hades; his wounds serve as a testimony to his ignominious end, abetted by Helen&#x27;s final act of treachery.

However, Helen&#x27;s portraits in Troy seem to contradict each other. From one side, we read about the treacherous Helen who simulated Bacchic rites and rejoiced over the carnage of Trojans. On the other hand, there is another Helen, lonely and helpless; desperate to find sanctuary, while Troy is on fire. Stesichorus narrates that both Greeks and Trojans gathered to stone her to death. When Menelaus finally found her, he raised his sword to kill her. He had demanded that only he should slay his unfaithful wife; but, when he was ready to do so, she dropped her robe from her shoulders, and the sight of her beauty caused him to let the sword drop from his hand. Electra wails:
=== Fate ===
Helen returned to Sparta and lived with Menelaus, where she was encountered by Telemachus in Book 4 of &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. As depicted in that account, she and Menelaus were seemingly reconciled and had a harmonious married life—he holding no grudge at her having run away with a lover and she feeling no restraint in telling anecdotes of her life inside besieged Troy.

According to another version, used by Euripides in his play &quot;Orestes&quot;, Helen had been saved by Apollo from Orestes and was taken up to Mount Olympus almost immediately after Menelaus&#x27; return. A curious fate is recounted by Pausanias the geographer (3.19.11–13), which has Helen share the afterlife with Achilles.

Pausanias also has another story (3.19.9–10): &quot;The account of the Rhodians is different. They say that when Menelaus was dead, and Orestes still a wanderer, Helen was driven out by Nicostratus and Megapenthes and came to Rhodes, where she had a friend in Polyxo, the wife of Tlepolemus. For Polyxo, they say, was an Argive by descent, and when she was already married to Tlepolemus, shared his flight to Rhodes. At the time she was queen of the island, having been left with an orphan boy. They say that this Polyxo desired to avenge the death of Tlepolemus on Helen, now that she had her in her power. So she sent against her when she was bathing handmaidens dressed up as Furies, who seized Helen and hanged her on a tree, and for this reason the Rhodians have a sanctuary of Helen of the Tree.&quot; There are other traditions concerning the punishment of Helen. For example, she is offered as a sacrifice to the gods in Tauris by Iphigeneia, or Thetis, enraged when Achilles dies because of Helen, kills her on her return journey.

Tlepolemus was a son of Heracles and Astyoche. Astyoche was a daughter of Phylas, King of Ephyra who was killed by Heracles. Tlepolemus was killed by Sarpedon on the first day of fighting in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Nicostratus was a son of Menelaus by his concubine Pieris, an Aetolian slave. Megapenthes was a son of Menelaus by his concubine Tereis, with no further origin.

In Euripides&#x27;s tragedy &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, Helen is shunned by the women who survived the war and is to be taken back to Greece to face a death sentence. This version is contradicted by two of Euripides&#x27; other tragedies, &quot;Electra&quot;, which predates The Trojan Women, and &quot;Helen&quot;, as Helen is described as being in Egypt during the events of the Trojan War in each.

== Artistic representations ==
From Antiquity, depicting Helen would be a remarkable challenge. The story of Zeuxis deals with this exact question: how would an artist immortalize ideal beauty? He eventually selected the best features from five virgins. The ancient world starts to paint Helen&#x27;s picture or inscribe her form on stone, clay and bronze by the 7th century BC. Dares Phrygius describes Helen in his &quot;History of the Fall of Troy&quot;: &quot;She was beautiful, ingenuous, and charming. Her legs were the best; her mouth the cutest. There was a beauty-mark between her eyebrows.&quot;

Helen is frequently depicted on Athenian vases as being threatened by Menelaus and fleeing from him. This is not the case, however, in Laconic art: on an Archaic stele depicting Helen&#x27;s recovery after the fall of Troy, Menelaus is armed with a sword but Helen faces him boldly, looking directly into his eyes; and in other works of Peloponnesian art, Helen is shown carrying a wreath, while Menelaus holds his sword aloft vertically. In contrast, on Athenian vases of c. 550–470, Menelaus threateningly points his sword at her.
The abduction by Paris was another popular motif in ancient Greek vase-painting; definitely more popular than the kidnapping by Theseus. In a famous representation by the Athenian vase painter Makron, Helen follows Paris like a bride following a bridegroom, her wrist grasped by Paris&#x27; hand. The Etruscans, who had a sophisticated knowledge of Greek mythology, demonstrated a particular interest in the theme of the delivery of Helen&#x27;s egg, which is depicted in relief mirrors.

In Renaissance painting, Helen&#x27;s departure from Sparta is usually depicted as a scene of forcible removal (rape) by Paris. This is not, however, the case with certain secular medieval illustrations. Artists of the 1460s and 1470s were influenced by Guido delle Colonne&#x27;s &quot;Historia destructionis Troiae&quot;, where Helen&#x27;s abduction was portrayed as a scene of seduction. In the &quot;Florentine Picture Chronicle&quot; Paris and Helen are shown departing arm in arm, while their marriage was depicted into Franco-Flemish tapestry.
In Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1604), Faust conjures the shade of Helen. Upon seeing Helen, Faustus speaks the famous line: &quot;Was this the face that launch&#x27;d a thousand ships, / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium.&quot; (Act V, Scene I.) Helen is also conjured by Faust in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;.

In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play Troilus and Cressida, Helen is a minor character who adores Troilus.

In Pre-Raphaelite art, Helen is often shown with shining curly hair and ringlets. Other painters of the same period depict Helen on the ramparts of Troy, and focus on her expression: her face is expressionless, blank, inscrutable. In Gustave Moreau&#x27;s painting, Helen will finally become faceless; a blank &quot;eidolon&quot; in the middle of Troy&#x27;s ruins.

== Cult ==

The major centers of Helen&#x27;s cult were in Laconia. At Sparta, the urban sanctuary of Helen was located near the Platanistas, so called for the plane trees planted there. Ancient sources associate Helen with gymnastic exercises or/and choral dances of maidens near the Evrotas River. This practice is referenced in the closing lines of Lysistrata, where Helen is said to be the &quot;pure and proper&quot; leader of the dancing Spartan women. Theocritus conjures the song epithalamium Spartan women sung at Platanistas commemorating the marriage of Helen and Menelaus:

Helen&#x27;s worship was also present on the opposite bank of Eurotas at Therapne, where she shared a shrine with Menelaus and the Dioscuri. The shrine has been known as the Menelaion (the shrine of Menelaus), and it was believed to be the spot where Helen was buried alongside Menelaus. Despite its name, both the shrine and the cult originally belonged to Helen; Menelaus was added later as her husband. In addition, there was a festival at the town, which was called Meneleaeia (Μενελάεια) in honour of Menelaus and Helen.
Isocrates writes that at Therapne Helen and Menelaus were worshiped as gods, and not as heroes. Clader argues that, if indeed Helen was worshiped as a goddess at Therapne, then her powers should be largely concerned with fertility, or as a solar deity. There is also evidence for Helen&#x27;s cult in Hellenistic Sparta: rules for those sacrificing and holding feasts in their honor are extant.

Helen was also worshiped in Attica along with her brothers, and on Rhodes as Helen &quot;Dendritis&quot; (Helen of the Trees, Έλένα Δενδρῖτις); she was a vegetation or a fertility goddess. Martin P. Nilsson has argued that the cult in Rhodes has its roots to the Minoan, pre-Greek era, when Helen was allegedly worshiped as a vegetation goddess. Claude Calame and other scholars try to analyze the affinity between the cults of Helen and Artemis Orthia, pointing out the resemblance of the terracotta female figurines offered to both deities.

== In popular culture ==
=== Pre-modern ===
Helen frequently appeared in Athenian comedies of the fifth century BC as a caricature of Pericles&#x27;s mistress Aspasia. In Hellenistic times, she was associated with the moon due to the similarity of her name to the Greek word Σελήνη (&quot;Selēnē&quot;), meaning &quot;Moon, goddess of the moon&quot;. One Pythagorean source claimed that Helen had originally come from a colony on the moon, where people were larger, stronger, and &quot;fifteen times&quot; more beautiful than ordinary mortals. She is one of the eponymous women the tragedy &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; produced in 415 BC by the Greek playwright Euripides.

Dio Chrysostom absolved Helen of guilt for the Trojan War by making Paris her first, original husband and claiming that the Greeks started the war out of jealousy. Virgil, in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, makes Aeneas the one to spare Helen&#x27;s life, rather than Menelaus, and instead portrays the act as a lofty example of self-control. Meanwhile, Virgil also makes Helen more vicious by having her betray her own husband Deiphobos and give him over to Menelaus as a peace offering. The satirist Lucian of Samosata features Helen in his famous &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;, in which he portrays her deceased spirit as aged and withered.

In the early Middle Ages, after the rise of Christianity, Helen was seen as a pagan equivalent to Eve from the Book of Genesis. Helen was so beloved by early medieval Christians that she even took on some of the roles of the Virgin Mary.

=== Modern ===

During the Renaissance, the French poet Pierre de Ronsard wrote 142 sonnets addressed to a woman named Hélène de Surgères, in which he declared her to be the &quot;true&quot;, French Helen, rather than the &quot;lie&quot; of the Greeks.

Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; has Helen tormented in the circle of lust alongside Paris.

Helen appears in various versions of the Faust myth, including Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s 1604 play &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot;, in which Faustus famously marvels, &quot;Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?&quot; upon seeing a demon impersonating Helen. The line, which is frequently quoted out of context, is a paraphrase of a statement from Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;. It is debated whether the phrase conveys astonishment at Helen&#x27;s beauty, or disappointment that she is not more beautiful. The German poet and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe re-envisioned the meeting of Faust and Helen. In &quot;&quot;, the union of Helen and Faust becomes a complex allegory of the meeting of the classical-ideal and modern worlds.

In 1803, when French zoologist François Marie Daudin was to name a new species of beautifully colored snake, the trinket snake (&quot;Coelognathus helena&quot;), he chose the specific name &quot;helena&quot; in reference to Helen of Troy.

In 1864, Paris saw the premiere of the operetta &quot;La belle Hélène&quot; by Jacques Offenbach.

Helen of Troy is a minor character in the opera &quot;Mefistofele&quot; by Arrigo Boito, which received its premiere in Milan in 1868.

In 1881, Oscar Wilde published a poem entitled &quot;The New Helen&quot;, in which he declared his friend Lillie Langtry to be the reincarnation of Helen of Troy. Wilde portrays this new Helen as the antithesis of the Virgin Mary, but endows her with the characteristics of Jesus Christ himself. The Irish poet William Butler Yeats compared Helen to his muse, Maude Gonne, in his 1916 poem &quot;No Second Troy&quot;. The anthology &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; by C. S. Lewis includes a fragment entitled &quot;After Ten Years&quot;. In Egypt after the Trojan War, Menelaus is allowed to choose between the real, disappointing Helen and an ideal Helen conjured by Egyptian magicians.

The English Pre-Raphaelite painter Evelyn De Morgan portrayed a sexually assertive Helen in her 1898 painting &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;. Salvador Dalí was obsessed with Helen of Troy from childhood and saw his wife Gala Dalí and the surrealist character Gradiva as the embodiments of Helen. He dedicates his autobiography &quot;Diary of a Genius&quot; to &quot;my genius Gala Gradiva, Helen of Troy, Saint Helen, Gala Galatea Placida.&quot;

Minor planet 101 Helena discovered by James Craig Watson in 1868, is named after Helen of Troy.

====20th century====

John Erskine&#x27;s 1925 bestselling novel &quot;The Private Life of Helen of Troy&quot; portrayed Helen as a &quot;sensible, bourgeois heroine&quot;, but the 1927 silent film of the same name, directed by Alexander Korda, transformed Helen into &quot;a shopaholic fashion maven&quot;.

In 1928, Richard Strauss wrote the German opera &quot;Die ägyptische Helena&quot; (&quot;The Egyptian Helena&quot;), which is the story of Helen and Menelaus&#x27;s troubles when they are marooned on a mythical island.

The 1938 short story, &quot;Helen O&#x27;Loy&quot;, written by Lester del Rey, details the creation of a synthetic woman by two mechanics. The title is wordplay that combines &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; with &quot;alloy&quot;.

The 1951 Swedish film &quot;Sköna Helena&quot; is an adapted version of Offenbach&#x27;s operetta, starring Max Hansen and Eva Dahlbeck. In 1956, a Franco-British epic titled &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; was released, directed by Oscar-winning director Robert Wise and starring Italian actress Rossana Podestà in the title role. It was filmed in Italy, and featured well-known British character actors such as Harry Andrews, Cedric Hardwicke, and Torin Thatcher in supporting roles.

The 1971 film &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; was an adaptation of the play by Euripides in which Irene Papas portrayed (a non-blonde) Helen of Troy.

In the 1998 TV series &quot;Hercules&quot;, Helen appears as a supporting character at Prometheus Academy as a student. Helen is caring and enthusiastic. She was the most popular girl in the academy and Adonis&#x27; girlfriend. Helen tries her best to keep Adonis from behaving stupidly, but mostly fails. She likes Hercules, but as a friend. She is a princess as in the myth but is not a half-sister of Hercules in the series. She was voiced by Jodi Benson.

====21st century====
A 2003 television version of Helen&#x27;s life up to the fall of Troy, &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;, in which she was played by Sienna Guillory. In this version, Helen is depicted as unhappy in her marriage and willingly runs away with Paris, with whom she has fallen in love, but still returns to Menelaus after Paris dies and Troy falls.

Helen was portrayed by Diane Kruger in the 2004 film &quot;Troy&quot;. In this adaptation, as in the 2003 television version, she is unhappily married to Menelaus and willingly leaves with Paris, whom she loves. However, in this version she does not return to Sparta with Menelaus (who is killed by Hector), but escapes Troy with Paris and other survivors when the city falls.

Inspired by the line, &quot;Was this the face that launched a thousand ships...?&quot; from Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Faustus&quot;, Isaac Asimov jocularly coined the unit &quot;millihelen&quot; to mean the amount of beauty that can launch one ship. Canadian novelist and poet Margaret Atwood re-envisioned the myth of Helen in modern, feminist guise in her poem &quot;Helen of Troy Does Countertop Dancing&quot;.

In the &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; episode &quot;Helen Hunt&quot;, Helen is portrayed by Israeli-American model and actress Bar Paly. In the episode, Helen is an anachronism appearing in 1930s Hollywood. She lands a job as an actress and unintentionally starts a war between two film studios. The Legends travel to the 1930s and try to get Helen back to the Bronze Age. She regretfully goes along, telling the team she wishes to stay away. After analyzing historical records of her impact on history, Zari Tomaz finds the best time to take her away from the fighting of her time and takes her to Themyscira. Helen reappears in the season three finale, &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Cuddly&quot;, as an Amazon warrior who assists the Legends in defeating the demon Mallus&#x27;s army.

<doc id="63446" wikidata="Q338688" url="?curid=63446" title="Dwarves in Middle-earth">
<text>In the fantasy of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Dwarves are a race inhabiting Middle-earth, the central continent of Arda in an imagined mythological past. They are based on the dwarfs of Germanic myths who were small humanoids that lived in mountains, practising mining, metallurgy, blacksmithing and jewellery. Tolkien described them as tough, warlike, and lovers of stone and craftsmanship.

The origins of Tolkien&#x27;s Dwarves can be traced to Norse mythology; Tolkien also mentioned a connection with Jewish history and language.
Dwarves appear in his books &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937), &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–55), and the posthumously published &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (1977), &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; (1980), and &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; series (1983–96), the last three edited by his son Christopher Tolkien.

== Characteristics ==

The medievalist Charles Moseley described the dwarves of Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium as &quot;Old Norse&quot; in their names, their feuds, and their revenges. In the appendix on &quot;Durin&#x27;s Folk&quot; in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Tolkien describes dwarves as:

&quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; considers Tolkien&#x27;s use of the adjective &quot;&quot;, noting its similarity with &quot;Þráinn&quot;, a noun meaning &quot;obstinate person&quot;, and a name found in the Norse list of Dwarf-names, the &quot;Dvergatal&quot; in the &quot;Völuspá&quot;. Tolkien took it for the name, Thráin, of two of Thorin Oakenshield&#x27;s ancestors. It suggests this may have been a philological joke on Tolkien&#x27;s part.
Dwarves were long-lived, with a lifespan of some 250 years. They breed slowly, for no more than a third of them are female, not all marry, and they have children only late in life. Tolkien names only one female, Dís, Thorin&#x27;s sister. They are still considered children in their 20s, as Thorin was at age 24; and as &quot;striplings&quot; in their 30s. Despite his young age, Dáin Ironfoot was 32 when he killed Azog, the orc chieftain of Moria. They had children starting in their 90s.

The Dwarves are described as &quot;the most redoubtable warriors of all the Speaking Peoples&quot; – a warlike race who fought fiercely against their enemies, including other Dwarves. Highly skilled in the making of weapons and armour, their main weapon was the battle axe, but they also used bows, swords, shields and mattocks, and wore armour.

Sauron gave seven Rings of Power to Dwarf lords. The Rings caused them to be wrathful and greedy for gold, but they were not brought under Sauron&#x27;s domination, nor did they gain longer life. Eventually all seven Rings were destroyed or reclaimed by Sauron. One of the rings was given to Durin III, and passed down to Thrór, who gave it to his son Thráin II, father of Thorin Oakenshield. Sauron captured Thráin and took the ring from him in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.

== Origins ==


The Dwarves are portrayed in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as an ancient people who awake during the Years of the Trees, after the Elves at the start of the First Age, but before Men when the Sun and Moon are created. The Vala Aulë, impatient for the arising of the Children of Ilúvatar, creates the seven in secret, intending them to be his children to whom he could teach his crafts. He teaches them Khuzdul, a language he had devised for them. Ilúvatar, creator of Arda, is aware of the Dwarves&#x27; creation and sanctifies them. Because they had been made by a Vala, Dwarves lacked souls until granted them by Ilúvatar. Aulë sealed the seven Fathers of the Dwarves in stone chambers in far-flung regions of Middle-earth to await their awakening.


Each of the Seven Fathers founds one of the seven Dwarf clans. Durin I is the eldest, and the first of his kind to awake in Middle-earth. He awakens in Mount Gundabad, in the northern Misty Mountains, and founds the clan of Longbeards (Durin&#x27;s Folk); they found the city of Khazad-dûm below the Misty Mountains, and later realms in the Grey Mountains and Erebor (the Lonely Mountain). Two others lie in sleep in the north of the &quot;Ered Luin&quot; or Blue Mountains, and they found the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards. The remaining four clans, the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots come from the East. After the end of the First Age, the Dwarves spoken of are almost exclusively of Durin&#x27;s line.&lt;ref name=&quot;R. Tolkien 1954 pp. 52/53&quot; group=T&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A further division, the even shorter , appears in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;. Moseley likens , the last known Petty-dwarf, to the similarly named Mime from the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.

== Artefacts ==
=== Mining, masonry, and metalwork ===

As creations of Aulë, they are attracted to the substances of Arda. They mine and work precious metals throughout the mountains of Middle-earth. They are unrivalled in smithing, crafting, metalworking, and masonry, even among the Elves. The Dwarf-smith Telchar is the greatest in renown. They build immense halls under mountains for their cities. They build many famed halls including the Menegroth, Khazad-dûm, and Erebor. Among the many treasures they forge are the named weapons Narsil, the sword of Elendil, the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin and the necklace Nauglamír, the most prized treasure in Nargothrond and the most famed Dwarven work of the Elder Days. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thorin gives Bilbo a Mithril coat of linked rings of mail.

=== Language and names ===

In Grey-elvish or Sindarin the Dwarves are called &quot;Naugrim&quot; (&quot;Stunted People&quot;), &quot;Gonnhirrim&quot; (&quot;Stone-lords&quot;), and &quot;Dornhoth&quot; (&quot;Thrawn Folk&quot;), and &quot;Hadhodrim&quot;. In Quenya they are the &quot;Casári&quot;. The Dwarves call themselves &quot;Khazâd&quot; in their own language, Khuzdul. Khuzdul is created for them by Aulë, rather than being descended from an Elvish language, as most of the languages of Men are. They write it using Cirth runes, a writing system originally created by Elves in Beleriand to write Sindarin, and later more fully developed by Daeron, an Elf of Doriath. The Cirth runes are adapted by Dwarves for writing Khuzdul. The Dwarves keep their language secret and do not normally teach it to others, so they learn both Quenya and Sindarin to communicate with the Elves, especially the Noldor and Sindar. By the Third Age the Dwarves are estranged from the Elves and no longer routinely learn their language. Instead, they mostly use the Westron or Common Speech, a Mannish tongue, in communicating with other races.

Each Dwarf has two personal names, a secret or &quot;inner&quot; name in Khuzdul, which is used only among other Dwarves and is never revealed to outsiders, and a public &quot;outer&quot; name for use with other races, taken from the language of the people amongst whom the Dwarf lives. For example, the Dwarves of Moria and the Lonely Mountain use outer names taken from the language of the Men of the north where they lived.

In reality, Tolkien took the names of 12 of the 13 dwarves – excluding Balin – that he used in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; from the Old Norse &quot;Völuspá&quot;, long before the idea of Khuzdul arose. When he came to write &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in order to explain why the Dwarves had Norse names, he created an elaborate fiction that many of the languages used in the book were &quot;translated&quot; into real-life languages for the benefit of the reader, roughly retaining the relationships of the languages among themselves. Thus, Westron was translated into English, the related but more archaic language of the Rohirrim was translated into Anglo-Saxon (Old English), and the even more distantly related language of Dale was translated into Norse. It is possible that the problem of explaining the Dwarves&#x27; Norse names was the origin of the entire structure of the Mannish languages in Middle-earth along with the fiction of &quot;translation&quot;.

=== Calendar ===

Tolkien&#x27;s only mention of the Dwarves&#x27; calendar is in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, regarding the &quot;dwarves&#x27; New Year&quot; or &quot;Durin&#x27;s Day&quot;, which occurs on the day of the last new moon of autumn. However, in his first drafts of the book, Durin&#x27;s Day was the &quot;first&quot; new moon of autumn. After he had finished writing the book, Tolkien went back and changed all occurrences of the date to the last new moon, more in keeping with the real-world Celtic calendar, but overlooked one mention in Chapter IV, which still named the date as the first new moon. Tolkien never noticed this inconsistency, and it was not corrected until the 1995 edition of the book. The astronomer Bradley E. Schaefer has analysed the astronomical determinants of Durin&#x27;s Day. He concluded that – as with many real-world lunar calendars – the date of Durin&#x27;s Day is observational, dependent on the first visible crescent moon.

== Concept and creation ==

=== Norse myth ===

In Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, the very few Dwarves who appear are portrayed as evil beings, employers of Orc mercenaries and in conflict with the Elves—who are the imagined &quot;authors&quot; of the myths, and are therefore biased against Dwarves. Tolkien was inspired by the dwarves of Norse myths and of later Germanic folklore (such as that of the Brothers Grimm), from whom his Dwarves take their characteristic affinity with mining, metalworking, and crafting.

=== Jewish history ===

In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Dwarves are portrayed as occasionally comedic and bumbling, but largely as honourable, serious-minded, and proud. Tolkien was influenced by his own selective reading of medieval texts regarding Jewish people and their history. The dwarves&#x27; characteristics of being dispossessed of their homeland in Erebor, and living among other groups but retaining their own culture, are derived from the medieval image of Jews, while, according to the Tolkien scholar John D. Rateliff, their warlike nature stems from accounts in the Hebrew Bible. Medieval views of Jews also saw them as having a propensity for making well-crafted and beautiful things, a trait shared with Norse dwarves. The Dwarf calendar invented for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; reflects the Jewish calendar&#x27;s Rosh Hashanah in beginning in late autumn.

=== Semitic-style language ===

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Tolkien continued the themes of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. When giving Dwarves their own language, Khuzdul, Tolkien decided to create an analogue of a Semitic language influenced by Hebrew phonology. Like medieval Jewish groups, the Dwarves used their own language only among themselves, and adopted the languages of those they live amongst for the most part, for example taking public names from the cultures they lived within, whilst keeping their &quot;true-names&quot; and true language a secret. Tolkien further underlined the diaspora of the Dwarves with the lost stronghold of the Mines of Moria. Tolkien elaborated on Jewish influence on his Dwarves in a letter: &quot;I do think of the &#x27;Dwarves&#x27; like Jews: at once native and alien in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue...&quot; In the last interview before his death, Tolkien said &quot;The dwarves of course are quite obviously, wouldn&#x27;t you say, that in many ways they remind you of the Jews? Their words are Semitic, obviously, constructed to be Semitic.&quot; This raises the question, examined by Rebecca Brackmann in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, of whether there was an element of antisemitism, however deeply buried, in Tolkien&#x27;s account of the Dwarves, inherited from English attitudes of his time. Brackman notes that Tolkien himself attempted to work through the issue in his Middle-earth writings. It has been suggested that the formation of the deep friendship between the dwarf Gimli and elf Legolas in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; overcoming longtime mutual suspicion can be seen as Tolkien&#x27;s reply toward &quot;Gentile anti-Semitism and Jewish exclusiveness&quot;.

The philologist Helge Fauskanger analyses Khuzdul, finding in it features of Semitic languages.

=== Spelling ===

The original editor of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; &quot;corrected&quot; Tolkien&#x27;s plural &quot;dwarves&quot; to &quot;dwarfs&quot;, as did the editor of the Puffin paperback edition. According to Tolkien, the &quot;real &#x27;historical&#x27; plural&quot; of &quot;dwarf&quot; is &quot;dwarrows&quot; or &quot;dwerrows&quot;. He described the word &quot;dwarves&quot; as &quot;a piece of private bad grammar&quot;. In Appendix F of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Tolkien explained that if people still spoke of &quot;dwarves&quot; regularly, English might have retained a special plural for the word &quot;dwarf&quot;, as with the irregular plural of &quot;goose&quot;, &quot;geese&quot;. Despite his fondness for it, the form &quot;dwarrow&quot; only appears in his writing as &quot;Dwarrowdelf&quot; (&quot;Dwarf-digging&quot;), a name for Moria. He used &quot;Dwarves&quot;, instead, corresponding to his &quot;Elves&quot; as a plural for &quot;Elf&quot;. Tolkien used &quot;dwarvish&quot; and &quot;dwarf(-)&quot; (e.g. &quot;Dwarf-lords&quot;, &quot;Old Dwarf Road&quot;) as adjectives for the people he created.

== Adaptations ==

=== Films ===

In Rankin-Bass&#x27; 1977 animated film adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thorin was voiced by Hans Conreid, with Don Messick voicing Balin, John Stephenson voicing Dori, Jack DeLeon voicing Dwalin, Fíli, Kíli, Óin, Glóin, Ori, Nori, Bifur, and Bofur, and Paul Frees voicing Bombur.

In Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated film &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the part of the Dwarf Gimli was voiced by David Buck.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s live action adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, Gimli&#x27;s character is from time to time used as comic relief, whether with jokes about his height or his rivalry with the elf Legolas. Gimli is played by John Rhys-Davies, who gave the character a &quot;Welsh-derived&quot; accent.

In Jackson&#x27;s three-film adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thorin is portrayed by Richard Armitage, with Ken Stott as Balin, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan Turner as Kíli, Dean O&#x27;Gorman as Fíli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, Jed Brophy as Nori, Adam Brown as Ori, John Callen as Óin, Peter Hambleton as Glóin, William Kircher as Bifur, James Nesbitt as Bofur, and Stephen Hunter as Bombur. Jackson&#x27;s films introduce a story arc not found in the original novel, in which Kili and the Elf Tauriel (a character also invented for the films) fall in love.

=== Role-playing games ===

In Iron Crown Enterprises&#x27; &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot; (1986), Dwarf player-characters receive statistical bonuses to Strength and Constitution, and subtractions from Presence, Agility and Intelligence. Seven &quot;Dwarven Kindreds&quot;, named after each of the founding fathers—Durin, Bávor, Dwálin, Thrár, Druin, Thelór and Bárin—are given in &quot;The Lords of Middle-earth—Volume III&quot; (1989).

In Decipher Inc.&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game&quot; (2001), based on the Jackson films, Dwarf player-characters get bonuses to Vitality and Strength attributes and must be given craft skills.

In the real-time strategy game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II&quot;, and its expansion, both based on the Jackson films, Dwarves are heavily influenced by classical military practice, and use throwing axes, war hammers, spears, and circular or Roman-style shields. One dwarf unit is the &quot;Phalanx&quot;, similar to its Greek counterpart.

<text>A heuristic or heuristic technique (&quot;problem solving&quot;, &quot;mental shortcut&quot;, &quot;rule of thumb&quot;) is any approach to problem solving that employs a pragmatic method that is not fully optimized, perfected, or rationalized, but is nevertheless &quot;good enough&quot; as an approximation or attribute substitution. Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision.

==Context==


Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier (2011) state that sub-sets of &quot;strategy&quot; include heuristics, regression analysis, and Bayesian inference.

Heuristics are strategies based on rules to generate optimal decisions, like the anchoring effect and utility maximization problem. These strategies depend on using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human beings, machines and abstract issues. When an individual applies a heuristic in practice, it generally performs as expected. However it can alternatively create systematic errors.

The most fundamental heuristic is trial and error, which can be used in everything from matching nuts and bolts to finding the values of variables in algebra problems. In mathematics, some common heuristics involve the use of visual representations, additional assumptions, forward/backward reasoning and simplification.

Dual process theory concerns embodied heuristics.
==Heuristic rigour models==



Lakatosian heuristics is based on the key term: Justification (epistemology).

===Contemporary===
The study of heuristics in human decision-making was developed in the 1970s and the 1980s, by the psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, although the concept had been originally introduced by the Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon. Simon&#x27;s original primary object of research was problem solving that showed that we operate within what he calls &quot;bounded rationality&quot;. He coined the term &quot;satisficing&quot;, which denotes a situation in which people seek solutions, or accept choices or judgements, that are &quot;good enough&quot; for their purposes although they could be optimised.

Rudolf Groner analysed the history of heuristics from its roots in ancient Greece up to contemporary work in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, proposing a cognitive style &quot;heuristic versus algorithmic thinking&quot;, which can be assessed by means of a validated questionnaire.

===Adaptive toolbox===

The &quot;adaptive toolbox&quot; contains strategies for fabricating heuristic devices. The core mental capacities are recall (memory), frequency, object permanence, and imitation. Gerd Gigerenzer and his research group argued that models of heuristics need to be formal to allow for predictions of behavior that can be tested. They study the fast and frugal heuristics in the &quot;adaptive toolbox&quot; of individuals or institutions, and the ecological rationality of these heuristics; that is, the conditions under which a given heuristic is likely to be successful. The descriptive study of the &quot;adaptive toolbox&quot; is done by observation and experiment, while the prescriptive study of ecological rationality requires mathematical analysis and computer simulation. Heuristics – such as the recognition heuristic, the take-the-best heuristic and fast-and-frugal trees – have been shown to be effective in predictions, particularly in situations of uncertainty. It is often said that heuristics trade accuracy for effort but this is only the case in situations of risk. Risk refers to situations where all possible actions, their outcomes and probabilities are known. In the absence of this information, that is under uncertainty, heuristics can achieve higher accuracy with lower effort. This finding, known as a less-is-more effect, would not have been found without formal models. The valuable insight of this program is that heuristics are effective not despite their simplicity – but because of it. Furthermore, Gigerenzer and Wolfgang Gaissmaier found that both individuals and organisations rely on heuristics in an adaptive way.

===Cognitive-experiential self-theory===
Heuristics, through greater refinement and research, have begun to be applied to other theories, or be explained by them. For example, the cognitive-experiential self-theory (CEST) is also an adaptive view of heuristic processing. CEST breaks down two systems that process information. At some times, roughly speaking, individuals consider issues rationally, systematically, logically, deliberately, effortfully, and verbally. On other occasions, individuals consider issues intuitively, effortlessly, globally, and emotionally. From this perspective, heuristics are part of a larger experiential processing system that is often adaptive, but vulnerable to error in situations that require logical analysis.

===Attribute substitution===
In 2002, Daniel Kahneman and Shane Frederick proposed that cognitive heuristics work by a process called &quot;attribute substitution&quot;, which happens without conscious awareness. According to this theory, when somebody makes a judgement (of a &quot;target attribute&quot;) that is computationally complex, a more easily calculated &quot;heuristic attribute&quot; is substituted. In effect, a cognitively difficult problem is dealt with by answering a rather simpler problem, without being aware of this happening. This theory explains cases where judgements fail to show regression toward the mean. Heuristics can be considered to reduce the complexity of clinical judgments in health care.

==Academic disciplines==
===Psychology===


In psychology, heuristics are simple, efficient rules, either learned or inculcated by evolutionary processes. These psychological heuristics have been proposed to explain how people make decisions, come to judgements, and solve problems. These rules typically come into play when people face complex problems or incomplete information. Researchers employ various methods to test whether people use these rules. The rules have been shown to work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases can lead to systematic errors or cognitive biases.

===Philosophy===
A heuristic device is used when an entity &quot;X&quot; exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity &quot;Y&quot;.

A good example is a model that, as it is never identical with what it models, is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in this sense. A classic example is the notion of utopia as described in Plato&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;The Republic&quot;. This means that the &quot;ideal city&quot; as depicted in &quot;The Republic&quot; is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development. Rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously.

&quot;Heuristic&quot; is also often used as a noun to describe a rule of thumb, procedure, or method. Philosophers of science have emphasised the importance of heuristics in creative thought and the construction of scientific theories. Seminal works include Karl Popper&#x27;s &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot; and others by Imre Lakatos, Lindley Darden, and William C. Wimsatt.

===Law===
In legal theory, especially in the theory of law and economics, heuristics are used in the law when case-by-case analysis would be impractical, insofar as &quot;practicality&quot; is defined by the interests of a governing body.

The present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons. In truth, actual investors face cognitive limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects. For instance, in all states in the United States the legal drinking age for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of alcohol consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary delineation is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.

The same reasoning applies to patent law. Patents are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society&#x27;s best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted monopoly on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including University of North Dakota law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries – such as software patents – should be protected for different lengths of time.

===Artificial intelligence===

The bias–variance tradeoff gives insight into describing the less-is-more strategy. A heuristic can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space. The heuristic is derived by using some function that is put into the system by the designer, or by adjusting the weight of branches based on how likely each branch is to lead to a goal node.

===Behavioural economics===
Heuristics refers to the cognitive shortcuts that individuals use to simplify decision-making processes in economic situations. Behavioral economics is a field that integrates insights from psychology and economics to better understand how people make decisions.

Anchoring and adjustment is one of the most extensively researched heuristics in behavioural economics. Anchoring is the tendency of people to make future judgements or conclusions based too heavily on the original information supplied to them. This initial knowledge functions as an anchor, and it can influence future judgements even if the anchor is entirely unrelated to the decisions at hand. Adjustment, on the other hand, is the process through which individuals make gradual changes to their initial judgements or conclusions.

Anchoring and adjustment has been observed in a wide range of decision-making contexts, including financial decision-making, consumer behavior, and negotiation. Researchers have identified a number of strategies that can be used to mitigate the effects of anchoring and adjustment, including providing multiple anchors, encouraging individuals to generate alternative anchors, and providing cognitive prompts to encourage more deliberative decision-making.

Other heuristics studied in behavioral economics include the representativeness heuristic, which refers to the tendency of individuals to categorize objects or events based on how similar they are to typical examples, and the availability heuristic, which refers to the tendency of individuals to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily it comes to mind.

==Stereotyping==
Stereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgements about things they have never seen or experienced. They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person (based on their actions), to classifying a plant as a tree based on it being tall, having a trunk, and that it has leaves (even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before).

Stereotypes, as first described by journalist Walter Lippmann in his book &quot;Public Opinion&quot; (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.

<text>Ungoliant () is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, described as an evil spirit in the form of a giant spider. Her name means &quot;dark spider&quot; in Sindarin. She is mentioned briefly in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and plays a supporting role in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, enabling the Dark Lord Melkor to destroy the Two Trees of Valinor, darkening the world.

Her origins are unclear, as Tolkien&#x27;s writings do not explicitly reveal her nature, other than that she is from &quot;before the world&quot;; this may mean she is a Maia, an immortal spirit. Scholars have likened the story of Ungoliant and Melkor to John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, where Sin conceives a child, Death, by Satan: Sin and Death are always hungry. There are limited parallels in Norse myth: while there are female giants, they are not usually spiders, though the Devil appears as a spider in an early Icelandic tale, and a female giant in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; is named Nótt (&quot;Night&quot;), she and her brood dwelling in and personifying darkness.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Ungoliant&quot; means &#x27;dark spider&#x27; in Tolkien&#x27;s invented language of Sindarin. It is a loan word from .
In early versions, recorded in &quot;Morgoth&#x27;s Ring&quot;, Tolkien writes &quot;Ungoliantë&quot;.

== Internal history ==

Tolkien&#x27;s original writings say that Ungoliant was a primeval spirit of night, named Móru, who aided Melkor in his attack upon the Two Trees of Valinor, draining them of their sap after Melkor had injured them. She also consumed the reserves of light from the wells of Varda. Afterward the light of the trees persisted only within the Silmarils of Fëanor. Ungoliant helped Melkor evade the Valar by shrouding them both in the impenetrable darkness she produced.

Melkor had promised Ungoliant to yield anything she wished in return for her aid, but betrayed this promise by withholding the Silmarils, and summoned the Balrogs to repel her. Ungoliant fled to the Ered Gorgoroth in Beleriand. At some point she gave birth to the Giant Spiders, including the character Shelob of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, it is stated that when she went into hiding her hunger was such that she would mate with other spiders only to devour them later, with her offspring used as food once fully grown. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; suggests that Ungoliant&#x27;s unremitting hunger may perhaps have driven her to devour herself.

== Analysis ==

According to the Tolkien scholar John Wm. Houghton, the story of Ungoliant and Morgoth is comparable to the account in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; in which Sin conceives a child, Death, by Satan. Both Sin and Death are always hungry; Satan says he will feed them, and leads them to the world.

Joe Abbott, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, comments that Ungoliant and Shelob are similar monsters, &quot;product of a singular concept&quot;. He observes that they are female giants, something found in Northern folklore. Those are not usually in spider form, but he notes an early Icelandic example where &quot;the Devil appears as a spider and has his leg cut off&quot;. On Ungoliant&#x27;s race, he notes Tolkien&#x27;s remark in &quot;The Theft of Melko&quot; (in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;) that &quot;Mayhap she was bred of mists and darkness on the confines of the Shadowy seas, in the utter dark that came between the overthrow of the Lamps and the kindling of the Trees, but &quot;more like she has always been&quot; [Abbott&#x27;s italics]; and she it is who loveth still to dwell in that black place &quot;taking the guise&quot; of an unlovely spider.&quot; He draws attention to Tolkien&#x27;s suggestions that Ungoliant has always existed and that she is simply choosing to appear (in the &quot;guise&quot;) as a spider, and states that this means she must be an immortal Maia, a spirit-being able to take on physical form. He offers the parallel of Nott (&quot;Night&quot;), an Icelandic female giant in the &quot;Gilfaginning&quot; in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; of Snorri Sturluson. Nott was dark, like all her kindred, just as Ungoliant and all her brood dwell in and &quot;personify&quot; darkness.

In &quot;Mythlore&quot;, Candice Fredrick and Sam McBride write that Ungoliant and the lesser spider Shelob signify purely irrational evil, &quot;wholly preoccupied with their own lusts; they operate on the pleasure principle.&quot; They contrast this with the Dark Lords Melkor and Sauron, who, while also wholly evil, possess the power of rational thought, &quot;evil guided by rationality&quot;. Thus, Melkor can think long-term, exploiting other beings to achieve his goals, whereas Ungoliant chooses &quot;instant gratification&quot;. They further assert that the spiders&#x27; irrationality required Tolkien to make them female, while the Dark Lords&#x27; analytical thought identified them as male.

In a version of &quot;Of the Darkening of Valinor&quot; written after &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and not included in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Tolkien added that &quot;[Ungoliantë] would not dare the perils of Aman, or the power of the dreadful Lords, without a great reward; for she feared the eyes of Manwë and Varda more even than the wrath of Melkor.&quot; Kristine Larsen, in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, comments that this mention of Varda&#x27;s power over the great spider is unique.

== Legacy ==

Ungoliant has been the subject of several heavy metal music songs. Her conflict with Morgoth over the Silmaril was the subject of Blind Guardian&#x27;s song &quot;Into the Storm&quot;, from their 1998 album &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot;. Austrian black metal band Summoning had a song called &quot;Ungolianth&quot; on their 1995 album &quot;Minas Morgul&quot;. On their 2006 album &quot;The Morrigan&#x27;s Call&quot;, the Irish Celtic metal band Cruachan featured a song &quot;Ungoliant&quot; as well as one named after Shelob.
Ungoliant is mentioned in the 2012 film &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, the first film of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, when the wizard Radagast the Brown conjectures on the origin of malevolent giant spiders endemic to Mirkwood.

<doc id="63455" wikidata="Q1621322" url="?curid=63455" title="Men in Middle-earth">
<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth fiction, Man and Men denote humans, whether male or female, in contrast to Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and other humanoid races. 
Men are described as the second or younger people, created after the Elves, and differing from them in being mortal. Along with Ents and Dwarves, these are the &quot;free peoples&quot; of Middle-earth, differing from the enslaved peoples such as Orcs.

Tolkien uses the Men of Middle-earth, interacting with immortal Elves, to explore a variety of themes in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, especially death and immortality. This appears throughout, but is the central theme of an appendix, &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;. Where the Hobbits stand for simple, earthbound, comfort-loving people, Men are far more varied, from petty villains and slow-witted publicans to the gentle warrior Faramir and the genuinely heroic Aragorn; Tolkien had wanted to create a heroic romance suitable for the modern age. Scholars have identified real-world analogues for each of the varied races of Men, whether from medieval times or classical antiquity. 

The weakness of Men, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; asserts, is the desire for power; the One Ring promises enormous power, but is both evil and addictive. Tolkien uses Aragorn and the warrior Boromir, the two Men in the Fellowship that was created to destroy the Ring, to show opposite reactions to that temptation. It becomes clear that, except for Men, all the peoples of Middle-earth are dwindling and fading: the Elves are leaving, and the Ents are childless. By the Fourth Age, Middle-earth is peopled with Men, and indeed Tolkien intended it to represent the real world in the distant past.

Commentators have questioned Tolkien&#x27;s attitude to race, given that good peoples are white and live in the West, while enemies may be dark and live in the East and South. However, others note that Tolkien was strongly anti-racist in real life.

==In the fictional world==

=== Creation ===
The race of Men in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional world, in his books &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, is the second race of beings, the &quot;younger children&quot;, created by the One God, Ilúvatar. Because they awoke in the First Age at the start of the Years of the Sun, long after the Elves, the Elves called them the &quot;afterborn&quot;, or in Quenya the &quot;Atani&quot;, the &quot;Second People&quot;. Like Elves, Men first awoke in the East of Middle-earth, spreading all over the continent and developing a variety of cultures and ethnicities. Unlike Tolkien&#x27;s Elves, Men are mortal; when they die, they depart to a world unknown even to the godlike Valar.

=== Free peoples ===

Men are one of the four &quot;free peoples&quot; in the list-poem spoken by the Ent Treebeard; the others being Elves, Dwarves, and Ents. Hobbits, not included on that list, were a branch of the lineage of Men. Hobbits were not known to the Ents, but on meeting Merry and Pippin, Treebeard at once worked that people into the list.

The concept of the free peoples is shared by Elrond. The Tolkien scholar Paul H. Kocher writes that, in the style of the medieval Great Chain of Being, this list places Men and the other speaking peoples higher than the beasts, birds, and reptiles which he lists next. &quot;Man the mortal, master of horses&quot; is listed last among the free peoples, who were created separately.

=== Diversity ===

Although all Men in Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium are related to one another, there are many different groups with different cultures. Those on the side of the hobbits in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the Dúnedain, the men who fought on the side of the Elves in the First Age against Morgoth in Beleriand, from whom other friendly groups, the Rangers including Aragorn, and the men of Gondor are descended; and their allies the Rohirrim.

The main human adversaries in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the Haradrim and the Easterlings. The Haradrim or Southrons were hostile to Gondor, and used elephants in war. Tolkien describes them as &quot;swart&quot;, meaning &quot;dark-skinned&quot;. The Easterlings lived in Rhûn, the vast eastern region of Middle-earth; they fought in the armies of Morgoth and Sauron. Tolkien describes them as &quot;slant-eyed&quot;; they ride horses or wagons, leading to the name &quot;wain-riders&quot;. The Variags of Khand formed a third but smaller group, who appear as vassals of Mordor in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Their name is from (&quot;Variag&quot;), meaning the Varangians, Viking or other Germanic warriors who served as mercenaries. Other human adversaries include the Black Númenóreans, good men gone wrong; and the Corsairs of Umbar, rebels of Gondor.

Sandra Ballif Straubhaar notes in &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that Faramir, son of the Steward of Gondor, makes an &quot;arrogant&quot; speech, of which he later &quot;has cause to repent&quot;, classifying the types of Men as seen by the Men of Númenórean origin at the end of the Third Age; she notes, too, that his taxonomy is probably not to be taken at face value.

=== History===
In a world with other intelligent and cultured races, Men in Middle-earth interact with each other and with the other races in a complex history, narrated mainly in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. Men are in general friendly with the other free peoples, especially Elves; they are implacable enemies of the enslaved peoples, especially Orcs. In the First Age, Men, the Edain, lived in Beleriand on the extreme West of Middle-earth. They form an alliance with the Elves and join a disastrous war against the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, which destroys Beleriand. As a reward for fighting in the war, the creator, Eru Iluvatar, gives the Edain the new island of Númenor as their home.

The key difference between Men and Elves now becomes central to the story: Elves are immortal, and return to Valinor, home of the godlike Valar, when they become weary of Middle-earth, or are killed in battle. Men, however, are mortal. Morgoth&#x27;s servant, Sauron, tempts the Men of Númenor to attack Valinor, in their search for immortality: Sauron has falsely insinuated that Men can become immortal just by being in that place. The Men and Númenor are destroyed: the island is drowned, Atlantis-like, beneath the waves; the world is made round; and Valinor is removed from the world, so that only the Elves can reach it. Sauron&#x27;s body is destroyed, but his spirit escapes to become the new Dark Lord of Middle-earth. A remnant of the Men of Númenor who remained faithful, under Elendil, sail to Middle-earth, where they found the kingdoms of Arnor in the North and Gondor in the South, remaining known as the Dúnedain, &quot;Men of the West&quot;. Arnor becomes fragmented, and declines until its kings become Rangers in the wilds, but they retain their memory of Númenor or &quot;Westernesse&quot;, through many generations down to Aragorn, a protagonist in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The line of kings in Gondor eventually dies out, and the country is ruled by Stewards, the throne empty, until Aragorn returns.

=== Intermarriage and immortality ===
Tolkien stated that the core theme of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was death and the human desire to escape it. The theme, which recurs throughout the work, is sharply visible in an appendix, &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;, in which the immortal Elf Arwen chooses mortality so that she can marry the mortal Man Aragorn. The result, as with the earlier intermarriage of their ancestors Lúthien and Beren in the First Age in Beleriand, was to make Aragorn&#x27;s line exceptionally long-lived among Men, and as the royal family intermarried with other people of Gondor, to maintain or extend the lifespan of the entire race.

=== Fading ===

The overall feeling in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, however, despite the victories and Aragorn&#x27;s long-awaited kingship and marriage, is of decline and fall, echoing the view of Norse mythology that everything will inevitably be destroyed. As the Tolkien scholar Marjorie Burns put it, &quot;Here is a mythology where even the gods can die, and it leaves the reader with a vivid sense of life&#x27;s cycles, with an awareness that everything comes to an end, that, though [the evil] Sauron may go, the elves will fade as well.&quot; This fits with Tolkien&#x27;s equation of Middle-earth with the real Earth at some distant epoch in the past, and with his apparent intention to create a mythology for England. He could combine medieval myths and legends, hints from poems and nearly-forgotten names to build a world of Wizards and Elves, Dwarves, Rings of Power, Hobbits, Orcs, Trolls and Ringwraiths, and heroic Men with Elvish blood in their veins, and follow their history through long ages, provided that at the end he tore it all down again, leaving nothing, once again, but dim memories. By the end of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the reader has learnt that the Elves have left for the Uttermost West, never to return, and that the other peoples, Dwarves, Hobbits, Ents and all the rest, are dwindling and fading, leaving only a world of Men.

Kocher writes that the furthest look into Man&#x27;s future in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is the conversation between the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, close friends, at the moment when they first visit Minas Tirith, the capital city of the Men of Gondor, &quot;and see the marks of decay around them&quot;. Gimli says that the works of Men always &quot;fail of their promise&quot;; Legolas replies that even if that&#x27;s so, &quot;seldom do they fail of their seed&quot;, in marked contrast to the scarcity of children among Elves and Dwarves, implying that Men will outlast the other races. Gimli suggests again that Men&#x27;s projects &quot;come to naught in the end but might-have-beens&quot;. Legolas just replies &quot;To that the Elves know not the answer&quot;. Kocher comments that this &quot;sad little fugue&quot; is at variance with the hopeful tone of the rest of the work, remaining cheerful even in the face of apparently insuperable odds.

== Analysis ==

=== Ambition for power ===
Kocher writes that the Rings of Power reflected the characteristics of the race that was to wear them. Those for Men &quot;stimulated and implemented their ambition for power&quot;. Whereas the tough Dwarves resisted Sauron&#x27;s domination, and the Elves hid their Rings from him, with Men his plan &quot;works perfectly&quot;, turning the ambitious kings into Ringwraiths, the nine Black Riders. With the One Ring to rule them, Sauron gains complete control over them, and they become his most powerful servants. Kocher comments that for Tolkien, the exercise of personal free will, the most precious gift, is &quot;the distinguishing mark of his individuality&quot;. The wise, like the Wizard Gandalf and the Elf-queen Galadriel, therefore avoid putting pressure on anybody. In contrast, Sauron is evil exactly because he seeks to dominate the wills of others; the Ringwraiths, the nine fallen kings of Men, are the clearest exemplars of the process.

Kocher states that the leading Man in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is Aragorn, though critics often overlooked him in favour of Frodo as protagonist. Aragorn is one of two Men in the Fellowship of the Ring, the nine walkers from the Free Peoples opposed to the nine Black Riders. The other is Boromir, elder son of the Steward of Gondor, and the two Men are sharply opposed. Both are ambitious, and both intend one day to rule Gondor. Boromir means to fight valiantly, to save Gondor, with any help he can get, and to inherit the Stewardship. Aragorn knows he is in the line of kings by his ancestry, but he is unknown in Gondor. When they meet at the Council of Elrond, they dispute who has been holding back Sauron. Aragorn presents the shards of the broken sword of his ancestor, Elendil, and asks Boromir if he wants the House of Elendil (the line of kings) to return. Boromir evasively replies that he would welcome the sword. The One Ring is then shown to the Council. Boromir at once thinks of using it himself. Elrond explains how dangerous the Ring is; Boromir reluctantly sets the idea of using it aside for the moment, and suggests again that Elendil&#x27;s sword might help save Gondor, if Aragorn is strong enough. Aragorn replies gracefully to the tactless suggestion. Kocher comments that by being both bold and tactful, Aragorn has won all that he wanted from Boromir: the sword is genuine, as is Aragorn&#x27;s claim to own it, and he has been invited back to Gondor. The Fellowship set off, temporarily united; when they reach Parth Galen, Boromir tries to seize the Ring from Frodo, causing Frodo to use the Ring to escape; the Fellowship is scattered. Orcs attack, seeking the Ring; Boromir repents, and dies trying to save the Hobbits, an act which redeems him. Aragorn gives Boromir an honourable boat-funeral. The quest eventually succeeds, and Aragorn, growing in strength through many perils and wise decisions is crowned King. Boromir gave in to the temptation of power, and fell; Aragorn responded rightfully, and rose.

=== Race ===
The status of the friendly races has been debated by critics. David Ibata, writing in &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, asserts that the protagonists in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; all have fair skin, and they are mainly blond-haired and blue-eyed as well. Ibata suggests that having the &quot;good guys&quot; white and their opponents of other races, in both book and film, is uncomfortably close to racism. The theologian Fleming Rutledge states that the leader of the Drúedain, Ghân-buri-Ghân, is treated as a noble savage. Michael N. Stanton writes in &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that Hobbits were &quot;a distinctive form of human beings&quot;, and notes that their speech contains &quot;vestigial elements&quot; which hint that they originated in the North of Middle-earth.

The scholar Margaret Sinex states that Tolkiens&#x27; construction of the Easterlings and Southrons draws on centuries of Christian tradition of creating an &quot;imaginary Saracen&quot;. Zakarya Anwar judges that while Tolkien himself was anti-racist, his fantasy writings can certainly be taken the wrong way.

With his different races of Men arranged from good in the West to evil in the East, simple in the North and sophisticated in the South, Tolkien had, in the view of John Magoun, constructed a &quot;fully expressed moral geography&quot;: Gondor is both virtuous, being West, and has problems, being South; Mordor in the Southeast is hellish, while Harad in the extreme South &quot;regresses into hot savagery&quot;.

Peter Jackson, in his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, clothes the Haradrim in long red robes and turbans, and has them riding their elephants, giving them the look in Ibata&#x27;s opinion of &quot;North African or Middle Eastern tribesmen&quot;. Ibata notes that the film companion book, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Creatures&quot;, describes them as &quot;exotic outlanders&quot; inspired by &quot;12th century Saracen warriors&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s Easterling soldiers are covered in armour, revealing only their &quot;coal-black eyes&quot; through their helmet&#x27;s eye-slits. Ibata comments that they look Asian, their headgear recalling both Samurai helmets and conical &quot;Coolie&quot; hats.

=== From &quot;clod&quot; to hero ===


The Tolkien scholar Deborah C. Rogers compares the Men of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; with the Hobbits. She notes that the Hobbits are to an extent the low, simple, earthbound &quot;clods&quot; of the story who like beer and comfort and do not wish to go on adventures; they fit the antihero of modern literature and Northrop Frye&#x27;s lower literary modes including various forms of humour. 

In contrast, Tolkien&#x27;s Men are not all of a piece: Rogers mentions the &quot;petty villain&quot;, Bill Ferny; the &quot;loathsome&quot; Grima Wormtongue; the &quot;slow-thinking&quot; publican Barliman Butterbur of Bree; &quot;that portrait of damnation&quot;, Denethor, Steward of Gondor; and at the upper end of the scale, the kingly Théoden, brought back to life from Wormtongue&#x27;s corruption; the &quot;gentle warrior&quot; Faramir and his brother the hero-villain Boromir; and finally the ranger Aragorn, who becomes king.

Aragorn is the opposite of hobbitish: tall, not provincial, untroubled by the discomforts of the wild. At the start, in Bree, he appears as a Ranger of the North, a weatherbeaten man named Strider. Gradually the reader discovers he is heir to the throne of Gondor, engaged to be married to Arwen, an Elf-woman. Equipped with a named magical sword, he emerges as an unqualified hero, in Frye&#x27;s &quot;High Mimetic&quot; or &quot;Romantic&quot; literary mode, making the whole novel indeed a heroic romance: he regains his throne, marries Arwen, and has a long, peaceful, and happy reign.

<text>The Great River Road is a collection of state and local roads that follow the course of the Mississippi River through ten states of the United States. They are Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana. It formerly extended north into Canada, serving the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. The road is designated as both a National Scenic Byway and an All-American Road in several states along the route.

The term &quot;Great River Road&quot; refers both to a series of roadways and to a larger region inside the US and in each state, used for tourism and historic purposes. Some states have designated or identified regions of state interest along the road and use the roads to encompass those regions.

It is divided into two main sections: the Great River Road and the National Scenic Byway Route. The eponymous segment runs on both sides of the river from Louisiana through the state borders of Kentucky/Illinois and Missouri/Iowa, excepting the full length of the road in Arkansas. A five-state section of the road has been designated a National Scenic Byway, running through Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. In 2021, eight of the 10 state routes were designated All-American Roads by the Federal Highway Administration, highlighting their national significance and one-of-a-kind features.

Developed in 1938, the road has a separate commission in each state. These in turn cooperate through the Mississippi River Parkway Commission (MRPC). The 2,340 miles (3,765 km) are designated with a green-and-white sign showing a river steamboat inside a pilotwheel with the name of the state or province. The over-all logo reads &quot;Canada to Gulf&quot; where the local name would be, and most MRPC publications denote the route as beginning at Lake Itasca in Minnesota and ending in Louisiana.

==Route description==

The Great River Road is not a single road but a designated route along connected segments of named and numbered highways and streets maintained by state, county, or local jurisdictions.

===National and other routes===
Until the early 1980s, a single Canada-to-Gulf alignment of the Great River Road, serving all ten states, was eligible for special federal funding. The states posted &quot;National Route&quot; plates above the markers on this route and marked their own alternate routes across the river, creating two alignments between New Orleans and Hastings-Point Douglas. Signs marking the National Route are now used only in Illinois and Minnesota. The National Route followed the following segments:
*Venice to Port Allen, Louisiana on the west bank
*Huey P. Long Bridge
*Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Greenville, Mississippi on the east bank
*Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge (replaced by the Greenville Bridge in 2010)
*Lake Village to West Memphis, Arkansas on the west bank
*Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge
*Memphis, Tennessee through Kentucky to Chester, Illinois on the east bank
*Chester Bridge
*McBride to Hannibal, Missouri on the west bank
*Mark Twain Memorial Bridge (replaced by the modern Mark Twain Memorial Bridge in 2000)
*East Hannibal to Niota, Illinois on the east bank
*Fort Madison Toll Bridge
*Fort Madison to Muscatine, Iowa on the west bank
*Muscatine High Bridge (replaced by the Norbert F. Beckey Bridge in 1972)
*Illinois City to East Dubuque, Illinois on the east bank
*Julien Dubuque Bridge
*Dubuque to Lansing, Iowa on the west bank
*Black Hawk Bridge
*De Soto, Wisconsin to Point Douglas, Minnesota on the east bank
*single route from Point Douglas to Lake Itasca

More recently, much of the Great River Road, including a portion in every state, has been designated a National Scenic Byway.

===Western route===
;Louisiana
Few if any signs are present in Louisiana, but the route has been defined by state law. It begins at Venice on the west bank, following LA 23 into Gretna, where the eastern route splits. The western route, historically part of the National Route here, turns west on LA 18, which it follows all the way to Donaldsonville except for a detour on LA 541 from Harvey to Bridge City. A short piece of LA 1 connects the Great River Road to LA 405, which hugs the river to another junction with LA 1 in Plaquemine. LA 988 loops off LA 1 from northern Plaquemine back to yet another junction south of Port Allen, where the route leaves LA 1 again on Oaks Avenue, which becomes LA 987-5 and turns north along the river on River Road. LA 987-4 (Court Street) leads back west to Jefferson Avenue, which the Great River Road follows north to LA 986 along the river and under the Huey P. Long Bridge (US 190), which carries the National Route to the east bank (with access via LA 987-1).

A state alternate route begins along LA 986, becoming LA 415 near Lobdell and continuing along the river to Hermitage. LA 416 takes the route inland along the False River, an oxbow lake, to LA 1 near Knapp. LA 1 is followed through New Roads to Keller, where LA 15 splits to continue along the river to southwest of Vidalia. LA 131 leads northeast to Vidalia, from which US 425 and US 65 take the Great River Road to Arkansas.

;Arkansas

The Great River Road enters Arkansas from Louisiana on US 65, which it follows to Dumas. The National Route enters the state on the Greenville Bridge (originally the Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge from 1940 to its replacement in 2010 by the current bridge), following US 82 to join US 65 near Lake Village. There it turns northeast on US 165, splitting onto Highway 1 in DeWitt until an intersection near Turner. The route follows a sequence of minor state highways: Highway 316 east, Highway 318 south, and Highway 20 east to Elaine, and Highway 44 northeast to Helena. It then uses short segments of Highway 20 and US 49 to reach US 49B into downtown Helena, where it leaves the state highway system, following Columbia, McDonough, and Holly Streets through a residential area. Between Helena and Bear Creek Lake, the Great River Road runs along County Road 239, a partially unpaved roadway hugging the east side of Crowley&#x27;s Ridge through the St. Francis National Forest. Highway 44 begins again at Bear Creek Lake and takes the route northwest across Crowley&#x27;s Ridge into Marianna, where it turns north on Poplar Street, west on Chestnut Street, and north on US 79. At Hughes, the Great River Road leaves US 79 and turns east on Highway 38, then north on Highway 147 around the north shore of Horseshoe Lake and on to US 70 at Lehi. US 70 leads east into West Memphis, where the National Route historically crossed the Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge. The final leg of Arkansas&#x27;s Great River Road turns north at West Memphis and uses Highway 77 and US 61 north into Missouri.
;Missouri
The Great River Road is marked entirely along state-maintained highways in Missouri, with more than half along US 61. Although plates for the National Route are not used in the state, it can be identified based on signage in Illinois.

A state alternate route enters the state from Arkansas and follows US 61, including two overlaps with I-55, all the way to Perryville. The National Route crosses the Mississippi from Illinois on the Chester Bridge, following Route 51 south to Perryville and then turning north along US 61. At exit 170 south of Festus, the Great River Road joins I-55, following that highway into St. Louis and using I-44 and I-70 to exit 220 on the St. Peters-O&#x27;Fallon border. From there the National Route follows the entire length of Route 79 to I-72 in Hannibal, where it crosses the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge back to Illinois. A second state alternate begins in Hannibal by running west on I-72 to its end at US 61, then turning north on US 61. It follows Route 168 to Palmyra, rejoining US 61 for the rest of its path to Iowa, except for the portion through La Grange and Canton, where the Great River Road uses the former alignment of US 61, now Route B.

;Iowa
As with Missouri, the National Route in Iowa can mostly be inferred by Illinois signage. On the other hand, the Great River Road uses a number of county and local roads in Iowa.

A state alternate route crosses the Des Moines River from Missouri into Keokuk, following US 136 into downtown. It follows a convoluted alignment, turning southeast on Main Street (still US 136), northeast on 4th Street, northwest on Orleans Avenue, northeast on 7th Street, northwest on Grand Avenue, and northeast on Rand Park Terrace, curving northwest onto the river-hugging Mississippi River Road (CR X28 and CR X21) through Montrose to US 61. US 61 and US 61 Business lead through Fort Madison to the Fort Madison Bridge and the entrance of the National Route into Iowa.

The National Route returns to US 61 via US 61 Business, splitting to follow CR X62 and Madison Avenue into Burlington. It turns east onto Main Drive through Crapo Park and curves back north on Main Street, which leads to CR X99 (former Iowa 99) to north of Toolesboro and CR X61 into Muscatine. After turning onto US 61 Business, the National Route leaves the state on the Norbert F. Beckey Bridge (Iowa 92).

A second state alternate route continues on US 61 Business, turning east to follow Iowa 22 along the river to Davenport. It follows another US 61 Business through that city and US 67 through Bettendorf, remaining on that highway until Sabula where it then follows US 52 north. After passing over the Great River Road Bridge in Bellevue the route reaches US 20 in Dubuque.

The National Route reenters Iowa on the Julien Dubuque Bridge (US 20), turning north onto Iowa 946 to reach US 52. In northern Sageville, the Great River Road turns north on CR C9Y, soon splitting onto Mud Lake Road, which, along with Circle Ridge Road, forms a loop back to CR C9Y in Sherrill. In Millville, the county road returns to US 52, which is followed into Guttenberg. As of 2012, the route through that city leaves US 52 east on Koerner Street, turning north on River Park Drive, west on Broadway Street, north on 2nd Street, west on Kosciusko Street, north on 3rd Street and through the municipal marina to CR X56. The Great River Road follows the entire length of CR X56 (including former Iowa 340) to McGregor, and then continues north on Iowa 76 and CR X52 (partly former Iowa 364) to Lansing, where the National Route crosses the Black Hawk Bridge (Iowa 9) to Wisconsin.

Finally, Iowa 26 carries a state alternate from Lansing north to the Minnesota state line at New Albin.

;Minnesota
The Great River Road enters Minnesota on MN 26, connecting to US 61 in La Crescent via a short piece of MN 16. Except for a detour onto MN 316, US 61 carries this state alternate route to its junction with the National Route in Hastings.

===Eastern route===
;Louisiana
A state alternate route begins in Gretna and crosses the Crescent City Connection (US 90 Business) into New Orleans. Tchoupitoulas Street leads along the river to Audubon Park, with Magazine Street, Leake Avenue, and Oak Street continuing from the other side of the park to the city line. In Jefferson Parish, the road becomes River Road (partly LA 611-1), from which the Great River Road jogs northwest on Hickory Street to LA 48. LA 48 hugs the river to Norco, where US 61 crosses the Bonnet Carre Spillway to LA 628, connecting in LaPlace to LA 636-3 and LA 44. Another river-hugging highway, LA 44 leads to Burnside, where LA 942 continues to Darrow; the route then follows LA 75, LA 991, and LA 327 around the curves of the river to Baton Rouge. Through that city, the Great River Road uses LA 30, Government Street, River Road (partly US 61 Business), State Capitol Drive, Third Street, Spanish Town Road, Fifth Street, and Capitol Access Road (LA 3045) to I-110. At the Airline Highway interchange on I-110, the National Route comes over the Huey P. Long Bridge (US 190) and turns north to follow I-110 and US 61 into Mississippi.

In January 1811, there was a rebellion of several hundred enslaved and free black people referred to as the 1811 German Coast uprising, beginning in St. John the Baptist Parish and continuing on a route through lower Louisiana toward New Orleans. A Louisiana militia countered the rebellion, the largest revolt of enslaved persons in United States history. Afterward, there were trials on the plantations and executions of the majority involved in the revolt. The heads of many of those executed were placed on spikes along the Great River Road.

Some sources show the Great River Road continuing south from New Orleans along the east bank on LA 46 and LA 39 to Pointe à la Hache or even further down to Venice.

;Mississippi
In Mississippi, much of the Great River Road follows US 61. Between Onward and west of Lula, it runs nearer to the river on MS 1. The routing in the vicinity of Lula is not marked; the only state-maintained road connecting to US 61 is US 49. Historically, the National Route turned off MS 1 at Greenville and followed US 82 to the Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge (replaced by the Greenville Bridge in 2010).

;Tennessee
The Great River Road enters Tennessee on US 61, following that highway along 3rd Street into Downtown Memphis. The National Route historically crossed the Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge, meeting 3rd Street at Crump Boulevard. The route follows a number of city streets along the riverfront: G.E. Patterson Avenue, Main Street, Beale Street, Riverside Drive, Jefferson Avenue, Front Street (passing the Pyramid), the A.W. Willis Bridge, Island Drive, Mud Island Drive, Second Street, and Whitney Avenue, joining US 51 in northern Memphis. It soon turns off on SR 388, and then follows a sequence of local roads past Meeman-Shelby Forest State Park: Locke Cuba Road, Bluff Road, Riverbluff Road, Herring Hill Road (which is partly unpaved), Pryor Road, and Richardson Landing Road. At Richardsons the route turns east with SR 59 to Covington, then runs north on US 51.

After crossing the Hatchie River on its westernmost bridge, the Great River Road again leaves US 51 at Henning, looping west on SR 87, north on partly unpaved Crutcher Lake Road (past Fort Pillow State Park) and Four Mile Lane, and east on SR 19 to rejoin US 51 at Ripley. It leaves US 51 for the last time at Halls, following SR 88 west to near Hales Point, turning north on SR 181 atop a levee to SR 79 near Cottonwood Grove. The route continues north, slightly east of the levee, along Hoecake Road, Robison Bayou Road, Bingham Road, Mooring Road, and SR 21 into Tiptonville. The Great River Road ends its Tennessee stretch by following SR 78 to the state line.

;Kentucky
The Great River Road&#x27;s National Route enters Kentucky from Tennessee on KY 94 and runs northeast and east through Hickman. At Cayce it turns north to follow KY 239, continuing on KY 123 from west of Clinton through Columbus to the Bardwell area. There two routes are signed, one following KY 123 to Bardwell and the other bypassing the city to the west on KY 1203. The last leg in Kentucky takes US 51 to the bridge across the Ohio River to Cairo, Illinois.

Signs are present for an alternate route that runs inland through Fulton, Clinton, and Arlington along KY 125, KY 166, KY 1648, US 51, and KY 80. It leaves the main route at Hickman and ends north of Columbus.

;Illinois
Portions of the Great River Road in Illinois are signed as the National Route, while other portions lack this banner. National Route signs continue to Mississippi River bridges, with the unbannered alternate routes spurring from these before the crossings. A number of spurs are also signed to parks and other points of interest off the main route.

The initial segment in Illinois is part of the National Route, entering from Kentucky at Cairo and leaving at Chester. It follows US 51 off the Cairo Ohio River Bridge through Cairo, and then IL 3 paralleling the river to near Chester. Before entering Chester city limits, the route turns west onto a signed truck bypass that runs closer to the river. It ends by turning southwest onto the Chester Bridge (IL 150) to Missouri.
The first section of unbannered route stretches from Chester to near Fall Creek. It begins at the approach to the Chester Bridge, following IL 150 and the remainder of the truck bypass back to IL 3, which carries the Great River Road all the way to East St. Louis. But instead of continuing along IL 3 through the riverside industrial areas, the route turns east on I-55 / I-70, north on IL 111, and back west on I-270 to rejoin IL 3 in Granite City. It soon leaves IL 3 for the last time to follow IL 143 into downtown Alton and then a short piece of US 67 to reach IL 100, which runs directly along the river for a significant distance before turning inland at Grafton. Rather than cross the Illinois River on the Brussels Ferry, the Great River Road remains with IL 100 alongside the Illinois River, first on the east side to the Hardin Bridge and then on the west side to Kampsville. There it turns west to rejoin the Mississippi River, following IL 96 to north of Hull and former IL 57 to the I-172 interchange near Fall Creek.

The National Route reenters Illinois on the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge (I-72) from Hannibal, Missouri and follows I-172 north to the IL 57 interchange, where the unbannered route from Chester ends. It follows extant IL 57 into Quincy and then US 24 and IL 96 to a point east of Warsaw, turning west onto that city&#x27;s Main Street and leaving to the northeast on 6th Street. A short jog east on US 136 in Hamilton returns the Great River Road to IL 96, which it follows, mostly right along the river, through Nauvoo to Niota. The National Route turns northwest there on IL 9 to the Fort Madison Bridge into Fort Madison, Iowa.

IL 96 continues to carry the unbannered route beyond Niota to Lomax, where IL 96 turns inland and the Great River Road follows Carman Road to US 34 near Gulfport. After following US 34 east to near Gladstone, it again turns north onto IL 164 through Oquawka, turning north just east of that village onto a county road that becomes 10th Street in Keithsburg. Main Street leads west to 4th Street and another county road, ending up on IL 17 west of Joy. Finally, after 2.5 miles (4 km) of travel west on IL 17 to a point north of New Boston, a third north–south county road (designated as CR A in Rock Island County) takes Great River Road traffic to IL 92 opposite Muscatine, Iowa.

The National Route reenters from Muscatine, following IL 92 east through the Quad Cities except for a detour onto County Road TT east of Illinois City. On the East Moline-Silvis border, the Great River Road turns back north along IL 84, which stays near the river most of the way to a point southeast of Galena. US 20 carries the route through Galena to East Dubuque, where the National Route crosses the river one last time into Dubuque, Iowa on the Julien Dubuque Bridge. No route is signed on the Illinois side of the Mississippi north of East Dubuque, although Wisconsin Highway 35 has Great River Road markers all the way to the state line (at IL 35).

;Wisconsin

WIS 35, which hugs Wisconsin&#x27;s western border, carries most of the Great River Road in that state from its entrance near East Dubuque, Illinois. The longest separation from WIS 35 is between Tennyson and a point south of Bridgeport, where WIS 35 heads inland through Lancaster and the Great River Road follows WIS 133 to Cassville, County VV and County A to Bagley, and County X and County C to return to WIS 35. The historic National Route entered Wisconsin on the Black Hawk Bridge (WIS 82), turning north on WIS 35 near De Soto. US 61 and US 53 take the route through downtown La Crosse, which WIS 35 bypasses to the east, and it follows WIS 35 Business in Holmen. Finally, at Prescott, the Great River Road turns west on US 10 across the St. Croix River on the Prescott Drawbridge into Minnesota.

;Minnesota
On entering Minnesota, the east-side alignment of the Great River Road (here signed as the National Route) follows US 10 west and US 61 south across the Mississippi on the Hastings Bridge into Hastings, where it joins with the west-side alignment.

The two sides of the Great River Road combine at the south end of the Hastings Bridge (US 61) in Hastings, Minnesota, with a single route (marked as the National Route) continuing to the headwaters at Lake Itasca. The route leaves Hastings to the west by following County 42, which begins along 2nd Street, west to the junction with MN 55. MN 55 turns north as it merges with US 52, and the Great River Road soon splits onto County 56 (former MN 56) into South St. Paul. There it follows I-494 east across the Mississippi on the Wakota Bridge and again turns north on US 10 / US 61, soon entering St. Paul. Shepard Road/Warner Road (mostly County 36 and 37) takes the route west along the St. Paul riverfront to I-35E, where it turns back south and recrosses the Mississippi on the Lexington Bridge. MN 13 takes it to Mendota, at which point it crosses the Minnesota River near its mouth on the Mendota Bridge (MN 55) and passes Fort Snelling. After MN 55 enters Minneapolis, the Great River Road turns east on 46th Street (County 46), south on Minnehaha Avenue, and east on Godfrey Parkway to reach the south end of the West River Parkway, a segment of the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. This scenic drive parallels the west bank of the Mississippi through downtown Minneapolis, becoming West River Road at the Plymouth Avenue Bridge and ending at the Broadway Avenue Bridge (County 66). After crossing the Mississippi again, the Great River Road turns north on Marshall Street (County 23) and East River Road (County 1), then turns back west to cross the Mississippi one last time in the Twin Cities area on the I-694 Bridge. From there to Champlin (opposite Anoka), it sticks to the old pre-freeway route of US 169 as much as possible, taking MN 252 north to Brookdale Drive and jogging east to West River Road, which leads to County 12 into Champlin.

County 12 continues along the Mississippi, becoming County 42 in Wright County. The route jogs north on MN 101 and then turns west on County 39 along the river to Monticello. There it picks up former MN 152 (which has been supplanted by I-94), now known as County 75 to St. Cloud. Through that city, the Great River Road follows Clearwater Road and 9th Avenue, crossing the Mississippi into Sauk Rapids on the Sauk Rapids Regional Bridge. County 33 (Benton Drive) leads to Sartell and another river crossing, the Sartell Bridge (County 29 / County 133), from which it uses the short County 78 to reach County 1. This road and its continuations in Morrison County - County 21, 25, and 52 - follow the west bank of the Mississippi to Little Falls, where it jogs east on MN 27 to County 213, which ends at MN 115 at the Camp Ripley entrance. The Camp Ripley Bridge takes MN 115 east to its terminus at MN 371, which the Great River Road follows north to Baxter, crossing the Mississippi at the south city limits.

As of 2010, the route through Baxter left MN 371 at College Drive, heading east back over the Mississippi on the College Drive Bridge into Brainerd. There it turned north on East River Road, east on Laurel Street, north on 6th Street (MN 371 Business), east on MN 210, and north on 8th Avenue (County 3). However, the left turn from College Drive onto East River Road is no longer permitted due to a reconstruction project.

The Great River Road leaves Brainerd to the north on County 3 (former MN 25), crossing the Mississippi again at the city limits. North of Merrifield it turns east on County 19, which leads to County 11 and then MN 6 south across the Mississippi and into Crosby. MN 210 leads east to Aitkin, where the route turns back to the north on County 1 and crosses the river yet again, then follows the unpaved County 21 and County 10 (separated by a bit of US 169) to Palisade. County 10 continues as a paved road from that city, north across MN 200 near Jacobson and northwest to Grand Rapids (becoming County 3 in Itasca County). The Great River Road does not cross the river in the Grand Rapids area, turning south on 7th Avenue, west on 10th Street and County 23, north on County 76, and west on County 63. At MN 6 the route jogs south to County 28, where it turns west and soon enters Cass County as County 65. Several more turns—north on County 74, west on County 3, and north to remain on County 3—take it to another Mississippi crossing onto County 18, from which it turns west on US 2 into Ball Club. County 39 and a bit of MN 46 lead to County 9, which runs southwest across the river at the Lake Winnibigoshish outlet and back to US 2, where it turns west to and beyond Bena.

From Bena to Bemidji, the Great River Road follows a large number of county roads that approximate the winding course of the Mississippi. These are, in order, 91, 54, 91, 10, 39 (bridge across the Mississippi near the Cass Lake outlet), 12, 33 (bridge between Allens Bay and Andrusia Lake), 8 (bridge between Andrusia Lake and Wolf Lake), 27, and 12 (yet another bridge). The route turns west onto 1st Street to reach MN 197, which crosses the river again into downtown Bemidji, where it turns west on 5th Street. That road continues west and south as County 7 (with yet another bridge), County 3, and County 10, from which the Great River Road again turns west on County 9, which becomes County 40 in Clearwater County and crosses the river yet again. Turning south on County 2, the route crosses the Mississippi River one last time before it crosses MN 200 and enters Itasca State Park on County 122.

===Canadian extensions===
The Great River Road formerly continued north into Canada. There were two routes, one from Bemidji into Ontario and the other from Lake Itasca into Manitoba. The former followed US 71 to the Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge, then Highway 71 to Longbow Corners on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 17) east of Kenora. Some sources indicate that it continued east on Highway 17 to Dryden or north on Highway 596 to Minaki. The other route followed MN 200 west from Lake Itasca to Zerkel, then ran north on MN 92 to Clearbrook, County 5 and BIA 3 to the shore of Lower Red Lake, MN 89 to Roseau, and east on MN 11 to Warroad. Crossing into Manitoba on MN 313, the Great River Road then followed Highway 12 north to near Ste. Anne, Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) to Winnipeg, and Highway 59 to near Victoria Beach, where it turned southeast on Highway 11 to near Seven Sisters Falls, Provincial Road 307 to near Rennie, Highway 44 to near West Hawk Lake, and finally east on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highways 1 and 17) to join the Ontario branch at Kenora.

==History==
The Mississippi River Parkway Planning Commission was formed in 1938 to develop plans for what was to become the Great River Road. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes urged the governors of the 10 states along the Mississippi River to form the commission. State planning officials had been developing the concept of a Mississippi River Parkway as an extension of an idea for a recreational river road that had been first put forward by the Missouri Planning Board in 1936.

The commission was instrumental not only in the early planning and development of the parkway but also in its construction, promotion, marketing, and development. Now known as the Mississippi River Parkway Commission and headquartered in Minneapolis, the commission continues to promote, preserve, and enhance the resources of the Mississippi River Valley and the Great River Road. Representatives of the 10 states and two Canadian provinces serve on the commission&#x27;s board of directors, and they serve as chairpersons of their state Mississippi River Parkway commissions. But the road from the commission&#x27;s beginning in 1938 to the success of the Great River Road today has been a long one—full of fits and starts. A late bloomer, the Great River Road was more than 30 years old before it really began to mature.

The U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; Committee on Public Lands held hearings in 1939 and 1940 to discuss a bill that would have authorized a feasibility study of the Mississippi River Parkway concept. While popular, the parkway idea was soon overshadowed by World War II.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1949 that Congress approved funding for a feasibility study. The study, &quot;Parkway for the Mississippi River&quot;, was completed by the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) (predecessor agency to the Federal Highway Administration) in 1951.

The study concluded that a parkway for the Mississippi River would benefit the nation as a whole. However, the report made an important distinction. Because it would be too expensive to build an entirely new parkway, BPR recommended instead that the project be designated a scenic route.

The scenic route would consist of existing riverside roads, and new construction would be limited to connecting the existing roads so that a continuous route could be developed. The existing roads would be upgraded to parkway quality. The modified approach would save a great deal of land acquisition and new construction costs. Another consideration was that some of the most scenic locations along the river had already been preempted by existing highways, railroads, and towns and cities.

The concept of a scenic route rather than a national parkway was adopted. As a result, the Great River Road is not owned by the National Park Service, as is the case with true national parkways, such as the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways. Instead, the states have developed the Great River Road through a nationally coordinated program. BPR recommended &quot;that the selected route shall be improved in a superior manner and that it should be dedicated to recreational purposes as well as to moving traffic&quot;. The needed construction and improvements &quot;can be done with regular apportionments under the federal highway act or by the states on their own...&quot;

With the Federal Highway Act of 1954, Congress responded to the recommendations of BPR by appropriating planning funds. BPR was authorized to work with each of the states to develop specific criteria for the parkway and to determine one specific route within each state for the Mississippi River Parkway. By the late 1950s, the familiar green-and-white pilot&#x27;s wheel marker began to spring up on various sections of the designated route. Planning continued through the 1960s. The 1961 Iowa highway map was the first map in that state to highlight the route.

With the completion of all the planning reports in early 1970, actual development of the Great River Road was ready to begin. Although a number of states put up Great River Road highway signs and used available state funds for scenic bluff protection and road improvements, full-scale development funds were not yet available. Legislation to fund the development of the Great River Road was included for the first time as part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973. From 1973 to 1982, Congress authorized a total of $314 million for the Great River Road. Most of those funds ($251 million) were allocated directly to the states.

With funds available, development could begin in earnest. In 1976, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued program guidelines setting criteria for the Great River Road. The states then set up their own procedures for selecting the route of the Great River Road within their state boundaries.

&quot;The Great River Road should be located within designated segments to take advantage of scenic views and provide the traveler with the opportunity to enjoy the unique features of the Mississippi River and its recreational opportunities&quot;, the guidelines said. The criteria also specified that the Great River Road should provide for a variety of experiences or themes, including history, geology, and culture, and that the road should provide convenient access to larger population centers. Protection of the Mississippi River corridor was required by &quot;appropriate route selection, effective control and development, and scenic easement acquisition&quot;.

The route of the federal Great River Road consists of sections that conform to the FHWA guidelines and that were eligible for the Great River Road funds in the 1970s and early 1980s. The states have designated alternative routes that include sections with significant scenic, historic, and recreational interest. While the federal Great River Road crisscrosses the river within each state, the alternative routes provide Great River Road routes on both sides of the river from the headwaters to the gulf. The Mississippi River Parkway Commission makes no distinction between the federal and state routes in its promotional efforts. However, some states do use highway signs that distinguish between a federal and state route.

In 2021, eight of the 10 state Great River Road National Scenic Byways were named All-American Roads by the Federal Highway Administration.

<doc id="63461" wikidata="Q2485929" url="?curid=63461" title="Goldberry">
<text>Goldberry is a character from the works of the author J. R. R. Tolkien. She first appeared in print in a 1934 poem, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, where she appears as the wife of Tom Bombadil. Also known as the &quot;River-woman&#x27;s daughter&quot;, she is described as a beautiful, youthful woman with golden hair. She is best known from her appearance as a supporting character in Tolkien&#x27;s high fantasy epic &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, first published in 1954 and 1955. 

Like her husband, Goldberry&#x27;s role and origins are enigmatic and have been debated by scholars. On her possible origins, scholars have compared her with a character in George MacDonald&#x27;s 1867 fairy tale &quot;The Golden Key&quot;, and with the eponymous character in the late-medieval lyric poem &quot;The Maid of the Moor&quot;. Her characterisation has been described as a mixture of the domestic and the supernatural, connected in some way with the river Withywindle in the Old Forest of Middle-earth. Some have suggested that she may be a divine being in Tolkien&#x27;s mythology; others, that she recalls the biblical Eve, a token of the unfallen creation; and an embodiment of joy, serving with Tom Bombadil as a model of the Catholic sacrament of marriage.

Both Bombadil and Goldberry were omitted from Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy; they were, however, included in the 1991 Russian television play &quot;Khraniteli&quot; and the second season of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;.

== Origins ==

J. R. R. Tolkien never explored the specific details regarding Goldberry&#x27;s origins. Tom Bombadil clearly identifies her as having been discovered by him in the river Withywindle within the Old Forest, and her title &quot;River-woman&#x27;s daughter&quot; strongly suggests that she is not a mortal human being. In a 1958 letter, Tolkien wrote that Goldberry &quot;represents the actual seasonal changes&quot; in &quot;real river-lands in autumn&quot;. He conveyed this notion through a poem recited by Frodo Baggins in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, specifically the lines &quot;O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!&quot; 

For the scholar of literature Isabelle Pantin, the sequence involving Goldberry in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is reminiscent of a passage from &quot;The Golden Key&quot; by George MacDonald: the heroine, Tangle, after having almost been suffocated by a tree believing herself being pursued by the bears of Goldilocks, is taken in by a kindly old lady dressed in a mermaid&#x27;s finery and holding a basin full of fish. Pantin noted that Goldberry herself is reminiscent of the Goldilocks character: she has a similar hairstyle and her house appears to be as comfortable as that of the bears&#x27;.

The Tolkien scholar John M. Bowers writes that Goldberry recalls &quot;The Maid of the Moor&quot;, a late-medieval lyric familiar to Tolkien which contains the lines

Goldberry first appeared in Tolkien&#x27;s 1934 poem, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, re-worked into a 1962 poetry collection of the same name. The poem tells of how she drags Tom into the river before he escapes, returning later to capture her and make her his bride. 
In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the first volume of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Frodo and his companions Sam, Merry, and Pippin encounter Goldberry and Tom in the Old Forest near Buckland. After the Hobbits are rescued from Old Man Willow, the couple offers them refuge in their cottage, which is surrounded by a pond of water lilies. The hobbits&#x27; stay is brief but strange, for Bombadil and Goldberry are clearly more than they seem. Like her earlier incarnation, Goldberry retains a link with nature, and more particularly running water. She is described as having a mermaid adornment on her hair, her gown &quot;rustled softly like the wind on the flowered banks of a river&quot; as she ran, and the songs she sings to the hobbits remind them of &quot;ponds and waters larger than they had ever known.&quot;

Goldberry&#x27;s final reference in Tolkien&#x27;s works prior to his death is in the poem &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, published in 1965. Described as wearing &quot;a wild-rose crown&quot;, she blows away a dandelion clock from within a lady-smock.

==Analysis==

=== Type of being ===

Goldberry does not fit easily into any of Tolkien&#x27;s definitions of sentient beings in his world, and like Tom Bombadil she remains an enigma. With regards to Goldberry&#x27;s true nature within the context of Middle-earth, the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey suggested that Goldberry is similar to the many named water spirits of traditional English folklore such as Jenny Greenteeth or Peg Powler of the River Tees, though she is a noticeably gentler figure than they are. The scholar Ann McCauley believed that she is likely a water sprite, while John D. Rateliff suggested that, at least within the context of Tolkien&#x27;s early mythology, she should be seen as one of the wide category of fays, spirits, and elementals.
Goldberry&#x27;s association with water, writes , thematically links Bombadil with Väinämöinen and his fiancée Aino from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish national epic. 

The scholar Ruth Noel calls Bombadil and Goldberry &quot;undisguised personifications of land untouched by humans&quot;.
Another proposed explanation is that she is one of the Ainur, specifically the Vala Yavanna. There are physical similarities between Goldberry and Yavanna: both characters have blond hair and dress in green, and are associated with the plant kingdom, which would make Tom Bombadil an avatar of Aulë, husband of Yavanna. Taryne Jade Taylor associates Goldberry with the Greek myth of the goddess Persephone, for the way she is captured by Bombadil and its association with the rhythm of the seasons, as well as Étaín, a deity in Irish mythology associated with light. For Christina Ljungberg, Goldberry is one of the three divinities of personified Nature that exist on the side of good: she represents the immanent goddess, while Elbereth or Varda represents the transcendent goddess, and the elf queen Galadriel combines these two aspects. 
=== Gender role ===

In the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, Katherine Hasser observed that Goldberry appeared to the hobbits in the diverse roles of &quot;goddess, nurturer, and manager of domestic responsibilities&quot;. With regards to her initial appearance, Hasser said Tolkien&#x27;s description evokes a &quot;Botticelli-like image of a woman embodied and surrounded by the natural characteristics of her environment&quot;, and her clothing reflects her peaceful, symbiotic connection with the natural world. 
Goldberry is sometimes discussed in critical commentary about the roles of women in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. She is presented as a hospitable domestic figure, a good hostess who feeds passing travellers. While the scholar of children&#x27;s literature Melissa McCrory Hatcher called her &quot;a mystical washer-woman&quot;, Hasser emphasized that the most significant point about Goldberry as a feminine figure is that she shares a cooperative and reciprocal domestic relationship with Bombadil, with a dynamic of equality that is not seen in other romantic pairings in Tolkien&#x27;s body of work as the other Middle-earth peoples often have a clearer separation of gender roles within their societies. Hasser noted that Goldberry is the sole female character in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; who does not have a personal agenda, and that she provides a feminine figure who is &quot;pure, content, significant to the world around her, and wise&quot; in its narrative.

=== Theological role ===
For several critics, the appearance of Goldberry in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; foreshadows that of Galadriel&#x27;s later appearance: both are beautiful and of regal stature, live in an isolated domain and are associated with water. Ann McCauley Basso compared Goldberry as a biblical Eve figure to Galadriel&#x27;s Mary. In an entry on redemption in mythopoeic writing by the Catholic writer Joseph Pearce for the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, the apparent innocence and primitive nature of Goldberry and Tom Bombadil is analogous to Adam and Eve, as they represent the &quot;Unfallen Creation&quot;.

=== Sacrament of marriage ===

The scholar Brandon Best sees Goldberry&#x27;s relationship to Tom Bombadil as a model of the sacrament of marriage, something to be witnessed rather than explained. Further, they sing of all creation, celebrating the natural order, and they include themselves as part of that order, with Goldberry&#x27;s song:

Robert Chapman-Morales notes that scholars such as L. Eugene Startzman and Jennifer Raimundo see Goldberry and Bombadil as embodiments of unexpected joy, an aspect of Tolkien&#x27;s eucatastrophe. He quotes one of Tolkien&#x27;s letters: &quot;the government of a &#x27;family&#x27; ... was not a monarchy ... It was a &#x27;dyarchy&#x27;, in which master and mistress had equal status, if different functions.&quot; He notes also that Basso describes the couple&#x27;s marital joy, and he remarks on their &quot;mutual respect when we see how different they are, yet how perfectly they work together&quot;.

==Adaptations==

=== Radio ===

In a twelve-part radio adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; which ran from 1955 to 1956, the producer Terence Tiller wrote Goldberry as Tom Bombadil&#x27;s daughter. This alteration annoyed Tolkien, though he conceded that the events described in the 1934 poem are not clearly summarized in the published version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. 

The chapters involving the Old Forest and its characters were omitted from Brian Sibley and Michael Bakewell&#x27;s 1981 radio adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In 1992, Sibley produced a radio series, &quot;Tales from the Perilous Realm&quot;, which featured short texts by Tolkien; the episode &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; covered &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; chapters cut from the 1981 adaptation, including those about the Old Forest. Goldberry is voiced by Sorcha Cusack for the adaptation. 

=== Film ===

In 1957 Tolkien was consulted about a cartoon of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, its first proposed cinematic treatment. On the subject of Goldberry, he said he would much rather that she be omitted from the adaptation than make a cameo appearance without context or meaning. The film director Peter Jackson omitted Goldberry and Bombadil from his films; he stated that this was because they did little to advance the story and would have made the films unnecessarily long. 

Only one adaptation includes Goldberry, the 1991 Russian &quot;Khraniteli&quot;, where she is portrayed by (as &quot;Zolotinka&quot;). The version uses a green screen technique to present her as much larger than the hobbits dining at her table.

Goldberry is portrayed by Raya Yarbrough in the second season of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;.

=== Games and other media ===

Along with Bombadil, Goldberry appears as a non player character in the 2002 video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, where she is voiced by Kath Soucie.

Goldberry appears in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;. She is found in &quot;Goldberry&#x27;s Glade&quot; in the Old Forest, where a quest to gather lilies on her behalf at the foot of Old Man Willow is given to the player by Bombadil. Her race is referred to as &quot;River-maid&quot;, as the game also features Goldberry&#x27;s sister Naruhel, an original character who is of a darker and crueller nature.

The 1969 &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; novel &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; depicts a parody character named &quot;Hashberry&quot;, partner to the equally drug-soaked Tim Benzedrine. Her name was a reference to Haight-Ashbury, a district of San Francisco nicknamed Hashbury and widely seen as the origin of hippie counterculture.

The 2023 &quot;&quot; set &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth&quot; includes the card “Goldberry, River-Daughter” and represents her as a Nymph whose color alignment is blue.

<text>Arwen Undómiel is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium. She appears in the novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Arwen is one of the half-elven who lived during the Third Age; her father was Elrond half-elven, lord of the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell, while her mother was the Elf Celebrian, daughter of the Elf-queen Galadriel, ruler of Lothlórien. She marries the Man Aragorn, who becomes King of Arnor and Gondor.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation, Arwen is played by Liv Tyler. She plays a more active role in the film than in the book, personally rescuing the Hobbit Frodo from the Black Riders at the Fords of Bruinen (a role played by Glorfindel in the book).

== Fictional biography ==

=== Narrative ===

Arwen was the youngest child of Elrond, lord of the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell and leader of the High Elves remaining in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age, and Celebrían, daughter of Galadriel, ruler of the Elvish forest realm of Lothlórien. Her elder brothers were the twins Elladan and Elrohir. Her name &quot;Ar-wen&quot; means &#x27;noble maiden&#x27; in Sindarin. She was given the name &quot;Evenstar&quot; as the most beautiful of the last generation of High Elves in Middle-earth.

As told in &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;, an appendix to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in his twentieth year Aragorn met Arwen for the first time in Rivendell, where he lived under Elrond&#x27;s protection. Arwen, then over 2,700 years old, had recently returned to her father&#x27;s home after living with her grandmother, Galadriel, in Lothlórien. Aragorn fell in love with Arwen at first sight. Thirty years later, the two were reunited in Lothlórien. Arwen reciprocated Aragorn&#x27;s love, and on the mound of Cerin Amroth they committed themselves to marrying each other. In making that choice, Arwen gave up the Elvish immortality available to her as a daughter of Elrond, and agreed to remain in Middle-earth instead of travelling to the Undying Lands.

Arwen first appears in the text of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in Rivendell, shortly after Frodo Baggins wakes in the House of Elrond: she sits beside her father at the celebratory feast. When the Fellowship of the Ring comes to Lothlórien, Aragorn remembers his earlier meeting with Arwen and pauses in reverence.

Shortly before Aragorn takes the Paths of the Dead, he is joined by a contingent of his people accompanied by Arwen&#x27;s brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, who bring him a gift from Arwen: a banner of black cloth. The banner is unfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to reveal the emblem of Elendil figured in &quot;mithril&quot;, gems, and gold; this becomes the first triumphant public announcement of the king&#x27;s return.

After the ring is destroyed, Aragorn becomes king of Arnor and Gondor. Arwen arrives at Minas Tirith, and they are married. She gives Frodo the Evenstar: her necklace with a white stone, to aid him when his injuries trouble him.

Arwen serves as inspiration and motivation for Aragorn, who must become King of both Arnor and Gondor before Elrond will allow her to marry him. &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot; relates that Aragorn and Arwen had a son, Eldarion, and at least two unnamed daughters. One year after Aragorn&#x27;s death, Arwen dies at the age of 2,901.

=== Relationships ===

Through her father, Elrond, Arwen was the granddaughter of Eärendil the Mariner (the second of the Half-elven), great-granddaughter of Tuor of Gondolin, and therefore a direct descendant of the ancient House of Hador. Through her great-grandmother, Idril, Arwen was a descendant of King Turgon of the Noldor. Through her mother, she was the granddaughter of the Elf-queen Galadriel of Lothlórien. Through both of her parents, Arwen was a direct descendant of the ancient Elven House of Finwë. Furthermore, Arwen was a descendant of Beren and Lúthien, whose story resembled hers. Indeed, Arwen was held to be the reappearance in likeness of Lúthien, fairest of all the Elves, who was called Nightingale (&quot;Tinúviel&quot;).

Arwen was a distant relative of her husband Aragorn. Aragorn&#x27;s ancestor, Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor, was her father Elrond&#x27;s brother, who chose to live as a Man rather than as one of the Eldar. Arwen became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor when she married Aragorn, who was of the line of the Kings of Arnor. By their marriage, the lines of the Half-elven were reunited. Their union served, too, to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the three kings of the high Elves (Ingwë, Finwë, and the brothers Olwë and Elwë) as well as the only line with Maiarin blood through Arwen&#x27;s great-great-great grandmother, Melian, Queen of Doriath.

As related in &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, Tolkien conceived the character of &quot;Elrond&#x27;s daughter&quot; late in the writing. Prior to this, he had considered having Aragorn marry Éowyn of the royal family of Rohan.

Arwen is depicted as extremely beautiful; she is in Melissa Hatcher&#x27;s view in &quot;Mythlore&quot; &quot;a symbol of the unattainable, a perfect match for the unattainable Aragorn in Éowyn&#x27;s eyes.&quot; Carol Leibiger wrote in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that Arwen&#x27;s lack of involvement follows the general Elvish pattern, already established in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and continued in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, of retreating to safe havens.

The scholar of English literature Nancy Enright wrote that Arwen, like Christ, is an immortal who voluntarily chooses mortality out of love, in her case for Aragorn. She granted that Arwen is not a conspicuous character, and unlike Éowyn does not ride into battle, but stated that her inner power is &quot;subtly conveyed&quot; and present throughout the novel.

==Adaptations==

=== Peter Jackson&#x27;s film series ===

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, Arwen is played by Liv Tyler. The films give her a more prominent role than her literary counterpart. 
In the first film, Arwen searches for Aragorn and single-handedly rescues Frodo Baggins from the Black Riders at Bruinen, thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. During this flight, Arwen wields the sword Hadhafang, which according to film merchandise was once wielded by her father and had belonged to his grandmother Idril Celebrindal.

In the film adaptation of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the injured Aragorn is revived by a dream or vision of Arwen, who kisses him and asks the Valar to protect him.

In the film, Arwen does not send Aragorn the banner she has made; instead, Elrond takes the sword Narsil, reforged as Andúril, to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that Arwen&#x27;s fate has become bound to the One Ring, and that she is dying. The Tolkien scholar Janet Brennan Croft comments that Jackson makes Arwen passive, denying her independence of mind; from being a constant support, she is a distraction, even a temptation, to Aragorn, whom Croft likens to &quot;the American Superhero&quot;, and their marriage, in the book a sign of his rightful kingship, is in the film something he accepts as if he was condemned to it.

In the extended version, Elrond asks Arwen, in Elvish with English subtitles, to accompany him to safety in Valinor, away from Middle-earth.

The Tolkien scholar Dimitra Fimi comments that the procession of Elves in the scene &quot;Arwen&#x27;s vision&quot; in the extended version borrows visually from the &quot;Celtic&quot; imagery of John Duncan&#x27;s 1911 Pre-Raphaelite painting &quot;Riders of the Sidhe&quot;. 
Sauron uses the Palantír to show Aragorn a dying Arwen (a scene from the future) in the hope of weakening his resolve.

The films portray Arwen as becoming human through her love for Aragorn; as in the novel, she follows the choice of her ancestor Lúthien to become a mortal woman for the love of a mortal man. The films introduce a jewelled pendant called the &quot;Evenstar&quot; which Arwen gives to Aragorn as a token of their love. A similar pendant appears in Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s short story &quot;The Jewel of Arwen&quot;, although in that story Arwen gives it to &quot;the Ring-Bearer&quot; rather than to Aragorn. In Tolkien&#x27;s novel, Arwen gives Frodo &quot;a white gem like a star...hanging upon a silver chain&quot; before he leaves Minas Tirith, saying, &quot;When the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles you...this will bring you aid&quot;.

In earlier versions of the script, Arwen fought in the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep and brought the sword Andúril to Aragorn. Some scenes of Arwen fighting in Helm&#x27;s Deep were filmed before both the film&#x27;s writers (with Liv Tyler&#x27;s approval) reconsidered the change and deleted her from the sequence. The critic John D. Rateliff wrote approvingly of the deletion of what he calls &quot;Arwen, &quot;, even though it came &quot;at the cost of reducing her to a sort of Lady of Shallott languishing for most of the final two films&quot;.

In the Mythopoeic Society&#x27;s &quot;Tolkien on Film: Essays on Peter Jackson&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Cathy Akers-Jordan, Victoria Gaydosik, Jane Chance, and Maureen Thum all contend that the portrayal of Arwen and other women in the Jackson films is thematically faithful to or compatible with Tolkien&#x27;s writings, despite the differences.

=== Other ===
In the 1981 BBC radio serialisation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Arwen is voiced by Sonia Fraser. In the musical theatre adaptation of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, Arwen, played in London in 2007 by Rosalie Craig, sings the Prologue, and three musical numbers: &quot;The Song of Hope&quot;, &quot;Star of Eärendil&quot; (with the Elven chorus) and &quot;The Song of Hope Duet&quot; (with Aragorn). In the 2009 fan film &quot;The Hunt for Gollum&quot;, Arwen is played by Rita Ramnani.

The &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; board game made use of a rendition of Arwen by Jackson&#x27;s conceptual designer, the illustrator John Howe; the work was inspired by the French actress Isabelle Adjani.

<text>Helix DNA was a project to produce computer software that can play audio and video media in various formats and aid in creating such media. It was intended as a largely free and open-source digital media framework compatible with numerous operating systems and processors (including mobile phones) and it was started by RealNetworks, which contributed much of the code. The Helix Community was an open collaborative effort to develop and extend the Helix DNA platform. The Helix Project has been discontinued.

Helix DNA Client is a software package for multi-platform, multi-format media playback. Helix Player is a media player compatible with Linux, Solaris, Symbian, and FreeBSD and uses the Helix DNA Client. 
The Helix DNA Producer application aids in producing media files, and Helix DNA Server can stream media files over a network.

It is used on Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and Sony Ericsson mobile phones. 800 million mobile phones with the Helix client have been shipped since 2004. It is also being used in embedded devices like the Internet Tablet OS from Nokia, which is found on the Nokia 770, N800 and N810 Internet Tablets. Cingular Video is also based on the framework. Other projects that use the Helix framework include RealNetwork&#x27;s Rhapsody online music service, the Banshee and Amarok music players, and MediaReady 4000. Helix DNA also manifests itself as the RealPlayer on Mobile Internet Devices (MID) and on Netbooks.

Developers from the Open Source Lab announced in 2007 they would use Helix technologies for content creation applications and collaboration in the One Laptop Per Child project.

Helix DNA client contains support for the following media formats:

<doc id="63469" wikidata="Q220110" url="?curid=63469" title="Rohan, Middle-earth">
<text>Rohan is a fictional kingdom of Men in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy setting of Middle-earth. Known for its horsemen, the Rohirrim, Rohan provides its ally Gondor with cavalry. Its territory is mainly grassland. The Rohirrim call their land the Mark or the Riddermark, names recalling that of the historical kingdom of Mercia, the region of Western England where Tolkien lived.

Tolkien grounded Rohan in elements inspired by Anglo-Saxon tradition, poetry, and linguistics, specifically in its Mercian dialect, in everything but its use of horses. Tolkien used Old English for the kingdom&#x27;s language and names, pretending that this was in translation of Rohirric. Meduseld, the hall of King Théoden, is modelled on Heorot, the great hall in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

Within the plot of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Rohan plays a critical role in the action—first against the wizard Saruman in the Battle of the Hornburg, then in the climactic Battle of the Pelennor Fields. There, Théoden leads the Rohirrim to victory against the forces of Mordor; he is killed when his horse falls, but his niece Éowyn kills the leader of the Ringwraiths.

== In Tolkien&#x27;s works ==

=== Etymology ===

Tolkien&#x27;s own account, in an unsent letter, gives both the fictional and the actual etymologies of Rohan:

=== Geography ===

In Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, Rohan is an inland realm. Its countryside is described as a land of pastures and lush tall grassland which is frequently windswept. The meadows contain &quot;many hidden pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs&quot; that water the grasses. The cartographer Karen Wynn Fonstad calculated Rohan to be 52,763 square miles (136,656 km2) in area (slightly larger than England).

==== Borders ====

Rohan is bordered to the north by the Fangorn forest, home to the Ents (tree-giants) led by Treebeard, and by the great river Anduin, called Langflood by the Rohirrim. To the northeast are the walls of Emyn Muil. After the War of the Ring, the kingdom is extended northwards over the Limlight to the borders of Lothlórien. To the east are the mouths of the River Entwash, and the Mering Stream, which separated Rohan from the Gondorian province of Anórien, known to the Rohirrim as Sunlending. To the south lie the White Mountains (&quot;Ered Nimrais&quot;). To the west are the rivers Adorn and Isen, where Rohan borders the land of the Dunlendings. To the northwest, just under the southern end of the Misty Mountains, lies the walled circle of Isengard around the ancient tower of Orthanc; at the time of the War of the Ring, it had been taken over by the evil wizard Saruman. The area of the western border where the Misty Mountains and the White Mountains drew near to each other is known as the Gap of Rohan.

==== Capital ====

The capital of Rohan is the fortified town of Edoras, on a hill in a valley of the White Mountains. &quot;Edoras&quot; is Old English for &quot;enclosures&quot;. The town of Edoras was built by Rohan&#x27;s second King, Brego son of Eorl the Young. The hill on which Edoras is built stands in the mouth of the valley of Harrowdale. The river Snowbourn flows past the town on its way east towards the Entwash. The town is protected by a high wall of timber.

Meduseld, the Golden Hall of the Kings of Rohan, is in the centre of the town at the top of the hill. &quot;Meduseld&quot;, Old English for &quot;mead hall&quot;, is meant to be a translation of an unknown Rohirric word with the same meaning. Meduseld is based on the mead hall Heorot in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; it is a large hall with a thatched roof that appears golden from far off. The walls are richly decorated with tapestries depicting the history and legends of the Rohirrim, and it serves as a house for the King and his kin, a meeting hall for the King and his advisors, and a gathering hall for ceremonies and festivities. It is at Meduseld that Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf meet with King Théoden. Legolas describes Meduseld in a line that directly translates a line of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;The light of it shines far over the land&quot;, representing &quot;líxte se léoma ofer landa fela&quot;. The hall is anachronistically described as having louvres to remove the smoke, derived from William Morris&#x27;s 1889 &quot;The House of the Wolfings&quot;.

==== Other settlements ====

Upstream from Edoras, deeper into Harrowdale, are the hamlets of Upbourn and Underharrow. At the head of Dunharrow (from Old English &quot;Dûnhaerg&quot;, &quot;the heathen fane on the hillside&quot;) is a refuge, Firienfeld, in the White Mountains. Aldburg, capital of the Eastfold, is the original settlement of Eorl the Young. The Hornburg, a major fortress guarding the western region, is in Helm&#x27;s Deep, a valley in the White Mountains.

==== Regions ====

The kingdom of Rohan, also called the Mark, is primarily divided into two regions, the East-mark and the West-mark. They are each led by a marshal of the kingdom. Rohan&#x27;s capital, Edoras, lies in a small but populous region in the centre south of the kingdom, the Folde. In an earlier concept, Rohan&#x27;s capital region was called the King&#x27;s Lands, of which the Folde was a sub-region to the south-east of Edoras. North of the Folde, the boundary between the East-mark and West-mark runs along the Snowbourn River and the Entwash. Most of the rest of Rohan&#x27;s population is spread along the foothills of the White Mountains in both directions from the Folde. In the West-mark the Westfold extends along the mountains to Helm&#x27;s Deep (the defensive centre of Westfold) and to the Gap of Rohan. Beyond the Gap of Rohan lies the West Marches, the kingdom&#x27;s far west borderland. The Eastfold extends along the White Mountains in the opposite direction (and was thus a part of the East-mark). It is bound by the Entwash to the north. Its eastern borderland is called the Fenmarch; beyond this lies the Kingdom of Gondor.

The centre of Rohan is a large plain, divided by the Entwash into the East Emnet and the West Emnet. These regions fell respectively into the East-mark and the West-mark. The northernmost region of Rohan, and the least populous, is the Wold. The Field of Celebrant (named for a synonym of the River Silverlode), even further north, is added to Rohan after the War of the Ring.

===Culture===
==== People ====

The Rohirrim are distantly related to the Dúnedain of Gondor, having descended from the same place. Unlike the inhabitants of Gondor, who are portrayed as enlightened and highly civilized, the Rohirrim are shown as being at a lower level of enlightenment.

The names and many details of Rohirric culture are derived from Germanic cultures, particularly that of the Anglo-Saxons and their Old English language, towards which Tolkien felt a strong affinity. Anglo-Saxon England was defeated by the cavalry of the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, and some Tolkien scholars have suggested that the Rohirrim are Tolkien&#x27;s wishful version of an Anglo-Saxon society that retained a &quot;rider culture&quot;, and would have been able to resist such an invasion. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that Tolkien derived the emblem of the House of Éorl, a &quot;white horse upon green&quot;, from the Uffington White Horse carved into the grass of the chalk downs in England.

While Tolkien represents the Rohirrim with Anglo-Saxon culture and language, their ancestors are given Gothic attributes. The names of Rhovanion&#x27;s royal family, (the ancestors of the Rohirrim), include such names as Vidugavia, Vidumavi and Vinitharya, which are of Gothic origin. Vidugavia specifically has been seen as an synonym for Vitiges, king of the Ostrogoths in Italy from 536 to 540. Tolkien saw this as a parallel with the real-world relationship between Old English and Gothic.

In response to a query about clothing styles in Middle-earth, Tolkien wrote:

==== Horses and warfare ====

The armies of Rohan were largely horsemen. The basic tactical unit was the &quot;éored&quot;, Old English for &quot;a unit of cavalry, a troop&quot;, which at the time of the War of the Ring had a nominal strength of 120 riders.
In time of war, every able man was obliged to join the Muster of Rohan. Rohan was bound by the Oath of Éorl to help Gondor in times of peril, and the latter asked for their aid through the giving of the Red Arrow. This has a historical antecedent in the Old English poem &quot;Elene&quot;, in which Constantine the Great summoned an army of mounted Visigoths to his aid against the Huns by sending an arrow as a &quot;token of war&quot;. Gondor could also call the Rohirrim in need by lighting the warning beacons of Gondor, seven signal fires along the White Mountains from Minas Tirith to the Rohan border: &quot;Amon Dîn&quot;, &quot;Eilenach&quot;, &quot;Nardol&quot;, &quot;Erelas&quot;, &quot;Min-Rimmon&quot;, &quot;Calenhad&quot; and &quot;Halifirien&quot;.

At the start of the War of the Ring a Full Muster would have been over 12,000 riders. Among the horses of the Rohirrim were the famed &quot;mearas&quot;, the noblest and fastest horses that ever roamed Arda. It was because of the close affiliation with horses, both in war and peace, that they received their name.

====Language====
Tolkien generally called the language simply &quot;the language of Rohan&quot; or &quot;of the Rohirrim&quot;. The adjectival form &quot;Rohirric&quot; is common; Tolkien once also used &quot;Rohanese&quot;. Like many languages of Men, it is akin to Adûnaic, the language of Númenóreans, and therefore to the Westron or Common Speech.

The Rohirrim called their homeland the &quot;Riddermark,&quot; a modernization by Tolkien of Old English &quot;Riddena-mearc&quot;, meaning, according to the Index to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;the border country of the knights&quot;; also &quot;Éo-marc&quot;, the &quot;Horse-mark&quot;, or simply the &quot;Mark&quot;. They call themselves the &quot;Éorlingas&quot;, the Sons of Éorl. Tolkien rendered the language of the Riders of Rohan, Rohirric, as the Mercian dialect of Old English. Even words and phrases that were printed in modern English showed a strong Old English influence. This solution occurred to Tolkien when he was searching for an explanation of the Eddaic names of the dwarves already published in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Tolkien, a philologist, with a special interest in Germanic languages, pretended that the names and phrases of Old English were translated from Rohirric, just as the English used in The Shire was supposedly translated from Middle-earth&#x27;s Westron or Common Speech. Examples include &quot;éored&quot; and &quot;mearas&quot;. The Riders&#x27; names for the cunningly-built tower of Isengard, Orthanc, and for the Ents, the tree-giants of Fangorn forest, are similarly Old English, both being found in the phrase &quot;orþanc enta geweorc&quot;, &quot;cunning work of giants&quot; in the poem &quot;The Ruin&quot;, though Shippey suggests that Tolkien may have chosen to read the phrase also as &quot;Orthanc, the Ent&#x27;s fortress&quot;.
In &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, chapter 6, the Riders of Rohan are introduced before they are seen, by Aragorn, who chants in the language of the Rohirrim words &quot;in a slow tongue unknown to the Elf and the Dwarf&quot;, a &quot;lai&quot; that Legolas senses &quot;is laden with the sadness of Mortal Men&quot;. The song is called the &quot;Lament of the Rohirrim&quot;. To achieve a resonant sense of the lost past, the now-legendary time of a peaceful alliance of the Horse-lords with the realm of Gondor, Tolkien adapted the short &quot;Ubi sunt&quot; (&quot;Where are they?&quot;) passage of the Old English poem &quot;The Wanderer&quot;.

&quot;Thus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in Rohan, recalling how tall and fair was Eorl the Young, who rode down out of the North,&quot; Aragorn explains, after singing the &quot;Lament&quot;.

=== History ===

==== Early history ====

In the 13th century of the Third Age, the Kings of Gondor made close alliances with the Northmen of Rhovanion, a people said in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to be akin to the Three Houses of Men (later the Dúnedain) from the First Age. In the 21st century, a remnant tribe of such Northmen, the Éothéod, moved from the valleys of Anduin to the northwest of Mirkwood, disputing with the Dwarves over the treasure-hoard of Scatha the dragon.

In 2509, Cirion the Steward of Gondor summoned the Éothéod to help repel an invasion of Men from Rhûn and Orcs from Mordor. Eorl the Young, lord of the Éothéod, answered the summons, arriving unexpected at a decisive battle on the Field of Celebrant, routing the orc army. As a reward, Éorl was given the Gondorian province of Calenardhon (except for Isengard).

====Kingdom of Rohan====

Eorl the Young founded the Kingdom of Rohan in the former Calenardhon; the royal family was known as the House of Eorl. The first line of kings lasted for 249 years, until the ninth king Helm Hammerhand died. His sons had been killed earlier, and his nephew Fréaláf Hildeson began the second line of kings, which lasted until the end of the Third Age. The two lines of kings are buried in two lines of grave mounds below the royal hall at Edoras, like those at Gamla Uppsala in Sweden, or Sutton Hoo in England.

In 2758, Rohan was invaded by Dunlendings under Wulf, son of Freca, of mixed Dunland and Rohan blood. The King, Helm Hammerhand, took refuge in the Hornburg until help from Gondor and Dunharrow arrived a year later. Soon after this Saruman took over Isengard, and was welcomed as an ally.

==== War of the Ring ====

Saruman used his influence through the traitor Grima Wormtongue to weaken Théoden. Saruman then launched an invasion of Rohan, with victory in early battles at the Fords of Isen, killing Théoden&#x27;s son, Théodred. Saruman was defeated at the Battle of the Hornburg, where the tree-like Huorns came from the forest of Fangorn to help the Rohirrim.

Théoden then rode with his army to Minas Tirith, helping to break its siege in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and killing the leader of the Haradrim, but was killed when his horse fell. He was succeeded by his nephew Éomer. His niece Éowyn and the hobbit Merry Brandybuck killed the Lord of the Nazgûl.

Éomer rode with the armies of Gondor to the Black Gate of Mordor and took part in the Battle of the Morannon against the forces of Sauron. At this time, the destruction of the Ruling Ring in Mount Doom ended the battle and the war. Éowyn married Faramir, Prince of Ithilien.

== Analysis ==

The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance writes that Théoden is transformed by Gandalf into a good bold &quot;Germanic king&quot;; she contrasts this with the failure of &quot;the proud Beorhtnoth&quot; in the Old English poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;. In her view, in the account of the battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep, the fortress of the Riddermark, Tolkien is emphasising the Rohirrim&#x27;s physical prowess.

The philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that the Riders of Rohan are, despite Tolkien&#x27;s protestations, much like the ancient English (the Anglo-Saxons), but that they differed from the ancient English in having a culture based on horses. They use many Old English words related to horses; their name for themselves is &quot;Éotheod&quot;, horse-people, and the names of riders like Éomund, Éomer, and Éowyn begin with the word for &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;eo[h]&quot;. In Shippey&#x27;s view, a defining virtue of the Riders is panache, which he explains means both &quot;the white horsetail on [Éomer&#x27;s] helm floating in his speed&quot; and &quot;the virtue of sudden onset, the dash that sweeps away resistance.&quot; Shippey notes that this allows Tolkien to display Rohan both as English, based on their Old English names and words like &quot;éored&quot; (&quot;troop of cavalry&quot;), and as &quot;alien, to offer a glimpse of the way land shapes people&quot;. 
Shippey states further that &quot;the Mark&quot; (or the Riddermark), the land of the Riders of Rohan – all of whom have names in the Mercian dialect of Old English, was once the usual term for central England, and it would have been pronounced and written &quot;marc&quot; rather than the West Saxon &quot;mearc&quot; or the Latinized &quot;Mercia&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Thomas Honegger, agreeing with Shippey&#x27;s description of the Rohirrim as &quot;Anglo-Saxons on Horseback&quot;, calls the sources for them &quot;quite obvious to anyone familiar with Anglo-Saxon literature and culture&quot;. The resemblances, according to Honegger, include masterly horsemanship, embodying the Old English saying &quot;Éorl sceal on éos boge, éored sceal getrume rídan&quot; (&quot;The leader shall on horse&#x27;s back, warband shall ride in a body&quot;). The Riders are a Germanic warrior-society, exemplifying the &quot;northern heroic spirit&quot;, like the Anglo-Saxons. But the &quot;crucial&quot; fact is the language; Honegger notes that Tolkien had represented Westron speech as modern English; since Rohan spoke a related but older language, Old English was the natural choice in the same style; Tolkien&#x27;s 1942 table of correspondences also showed that the language of the people of Dale was represented by Norse. Honegger notes that this does not equate the Rohirrim with the Anglo-Saxons (on horseback or not), but it does show a strong connection, making them &quot;the people most dear to Tolkien and all medievalists.&quot;

Jane Ciabattari writes on BBC Culture that Lady Éowyn&#x27;s fear of being caged rather than &quot;doing great deeds&quot; by riding to battle with the Rohirrim resonated with 1960s feminists, contributing to the success of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; at that time.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

For Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, the Poolburn Reservoir in Central Otago, New Zealand was used for Rohan scenes. The theme for Rohan is played on a Hardanger fiddle. A fully realised set for Edoras was built on Mount Sunday in the upper reaches of the Rangitata Valley, near Erewhon in New Zealand. Some of the set was built digitally, but the main buildings atop the city were built on location; the mountain ranges in the background were part of the actual location shot. The interiors of buildings such as the Golden Hall, however, were located on soundstages in other parts of New Zealand; when the camera is inside of the Golden Hall, looking out the open gates, the image of the on-set Edoras set is digitally inserted into the door-frame. The site was known among the cast and crew for being extremely windy, as can be seen during the film and DVD interviews. After filming, Mount Sunday was returned to its original state.

<text>A discrete element method (DEM), also called a distinct element method, is any of a family of numerical methods for computing the motion and effect of a large number of small particles. Though DEM is very closely related to molecular dynamics, the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees-of-freedom as well as stateful contact, particle deformation and often complicated geometries (including polyhedra). With advances in computing power and numerical algorithms for nearest neighbor sorting, it has become possible to numerically simulate millions of particles on a single processor. Today DEM is becoming widely accepted as an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular and discontinuous materials, especially in granular flows, powder mechanics, ice and rock mechanics. DEM has been extended into the Extended Discrete Element Method taking heat transfer, chemical reaction and coupling to CFD and FEM into account.

Discrete element methods are relatively computationally intensive, which limits either the length of a simulation or the number of particles. Several DEM codes, as do molecular dynamics codes, take advantage of parallel processing capabilities (shared or distributed systems) to scale up the number of particles or length of the simulation. An alternative to treating all particles separately is to average the physics across many particles and thereby treat the material as a continuum. In the case of solid-like granular behavior as in soil mechanics, the continuum approach usually treats the material as elastic or elasto-plastic and models it with the finite element method or a mesh free method. In the case of liquid-like or gas-like granular flow, the continuum approach may treat the material as a fluid and use computational fluid dynamics. Drawbacks to homogenization of the granular scale physics, however, are well-documented and should be considered carefully before attempting to use a continuum approach.

==The DEM family==
The various branches of the DEM family are the distinct element method proposed by Peter A. Cundall and Otto D. L. Strack in 1979, the generalized discrete element method, the discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) and the finite-discrete element method concurrently developed by several groups (e.g., Munjiza and Owen). The general method was originally developed by Cundall in 1971 to problems in rock mechanics. 
Williams showed that DEM could be viewed as a generalized finite element method, allowing deformation and fracturing of particles. Its application to geomechanics problems is described in the book &quot;Numerical Methods in Rock Mechanics&quot;. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd International Conferences on Discrete Element Methods have been a common point for researchers to publish advances in the method and its applications. Journal articles reviewing the state of the art have been published by Williams and O&#x27;Connnor, Bicanic, and Bobet et al. (see below). A comprehensive treatment of the combined Finite Element-Discrete Element Method is contained in the book &quot;The Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method&quot;.

==Applications==
The fundamental assumption of the method is that the material consists of separate, discrete particles. These particles may have different shapes and properties that influence inter-particle contact. Some examples are:
* liquids and solutions, for instance of sugar or proteins;
* bulk materials in storage silos, like cereal;
* granular matter, like sand;
* powders, like toner.
* Blocky or jointed rock masses

Typical industries using DEM are:
* Agriculture and food handling
* Chemical
*Detergents
* Oil and gas
* Mining
* Mineral processing
* Pharmaceutical industry
* Powder metallurgy

==Outline of the method==

A DEM-simulation is started by first generating a model, which results in spatially orienting all particles and assigning an initial velocity. The forces which act on each particle are computed from the initial data and the relevant physical laws and contact models. Generally, a simulation consists of three parts: the initialization, explicit time-stepping, and post-processing. The time-stepping usually requires a nearest neighbor sorting step to reduce the number of possible contact pairs and decrease the computational requirements; this is often only performed periodically.

The following forces may have to be considered in macroscopic simulations:
* friction, when two particles touch each other;
* contact plasticity, or recoil, when two particles collide;
* gravity, the force of attraction between particles due to their mass, which is only relevant in astronomical simulations.
* attractive potentials, such as cohesion, adhesion, liquid bridging, electrostatic attraction. Note that, because of the overhead from determining nearest neighbor pairs, exact resolution of long-range, compared with particle size, forces can increase computational cost or require specialized algorithms to resolve these interactions.

On a molecular level, we may consider:
* the Coulomb force, the electrostatic attraction or repulsion of particles carrying electric charge;
* Pauli repulsion, when two atoms approach each other closely;
* van der Waals force.

All these forces are added up to find the total force acting on each particle. An integration method is employed to compute the change in the position and the velocity of each particle during a certain time step from Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. Then, the new positions are used to compute the forces during the next step, and this loop is repeated until the simulation ends.

Typical integration methods used in a discrete element method are:
* the Verlet algorithm,
* velocity Verlet,
* symplectic integrators,
* the leapfrog method.

==Thermal DEM==
The discrete element method is widely applied for the consideration of mechanical interactions in many-body problems, particularly granular materials. Among the various extensions to DEM, the consideration of heat flow is particularly useful. Generally speaking in Thermal DEM methods, the thermo-mechanical coupling is considered, whereby the thermal properties of an individual element are considered in order to model heat flow through a macroscopic granular or multi-element medium subject to a mechanical loading. Interparticle forces, computed as a part of classical DEM, are used to determined areas of true interparticle contact and thus model the conductive transfer of heat from one solid element to another. A further aspect that is considered in DEM is the gas phase conduction, radiation and convection of heat in the interparticle spaces. To facilitate this, properties of the inter-element gaseous phase need to be considered in terms of pressure, gas conductivity and the mean-free path of gas molecules.

==Long-range forces==

When long-range forces (typically gravity or the Coulomb force) are taken into account, then the interaction between each pair of particles needs to be computed. Both the number of interactions and cost of computation increase quadratically with the number of particles. This is not acceptable for simulations with large number of particles. A possible way to avoid this problem is to combine some particles, which are far away from the particle under consideration, into one pseudoparticle. Consider as an example the interaction between a star and a distant galaxy: The error arising from combining all the stars in the distant galaxy into one point mass is negligible. So-called tree algorithms are used to decide which particles can be combined into one pseudoparticle. These algorithms arrange all particles in a tree, a quadtree in the two-dimensional case and an octree in the three-dimensional case.

However, simulations in molecular dynamics divide the space in which the simulation take place into cells. Particles leaving through one side of a cell are simply inserted at the other side (periodic boundary conditions); the same goes for the forces. The force is no longer taken into account after the so-called cut-off distance (usually half the length of a cell), so that a particle is not influenced by the mirror image of the same particle in the other side of the cell. One can now increase the number of particles by simply copying the cells.

Algorithms to deal with long-range force include:
* Barnes–Hut simulation,
* the fast multipole method.

==Combined finite-discrete element method==

Following the work by Munjiza and Owen, the combined finite-discrete element method has been further developed to various irregular and deformable particles in many applications including pharmaceutical tableting, packaging and flow simulations, and impact analysis.

==Advantages and limitations==
Advantages
* DEM can be used to simulate a wide variety of granular flow and rock mechanics situations. Several research groups have independently developed simulation software that agrees well with experimental findings in a wide range of engineering applications, including adhesive powders, granular flow, and jointed rock masses.
* DEM allows a more detailed study of the micro-dynamics of powder flows than is often possible using physical experiments. For example, the force networks formed in a granular media can be visualized using DEM. Such measurements are nearly impossible in experiments with small and many particles.
* The general characteristics of force-transmitting contacts in granular assemblies under external loading environments agree with experimental studies using Photo-stress analysis (PSA).

Disadvantages
* The maximum number of particles, and duration of a virtual simulation is limited by computational power. Typical flows contain billions of particles, but contemporary DEM simulations on large cluster computing resources have only recently been able to approach this scale for sufficiently long time (simulated time, not actual program execution time). 
* DEM is computationally demanding, which is the reason why it has not been so readily and widely adopted as continuum approaches in computational engineering sciences and industry. However, the actual program execution times can be reduced significantly when graphical processing units (GPUs) are utilized to conduct DEM simulations, due to the large number of computing cores on typical GPUs. In addition GPUs tend to be significantly more energy efficient than conventional computing clusters when conducting DEM simulations i.e. a DEM simulation solved on GPUs requires less energy than when it is solved on a conventional computing cluster.

<text>Chapter 7 of Title 11 U.S. Code is the bankruptcy code that governs the process of liquidation under the bankruptcy laws of the U.S. In contrast to bankruptcy under Chapter 11 and Chapter 13, which govern the process of &quot;reorganization&quot; of a debtor, Chapter 7 bankruptcy is the most common form of bankruptcy in the U.S.

== For businesses ==
When a financially troubled business is unable to pay creditors, the business may file (or be compelled by creditors to file) for bankruptcy in a federal court under Chapter 7, which means that the business ceases operations unless those operations are continued by the Chapter 7 trustee. In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the trustee is appointed almost immediately, with broad powers to examine the finances of the business in bankruptcy; generally, the trustee sells the assets and distributes the money to the creditors.

The investors who took the least amount of risk prior to the bankruptcy are generally paid first. For example, secured creditors will have taken less risk, because the credit that they will have extended is usually backed by collateral, such as assets of the debtor company. Fully secured creditors—that is, creditors, 
such as collateralized bondholders and mortgage lenders, for whom the value of collateral equals or exceeds the amount of debt outstanding—have a legally enforceable right to the collateral securing their loans or to the equivalent value, a right that generally cannot be defeated by bankruptcy. They are therefore not entitled to participate in any distribution of liquidated assets that the bankruptcy trustee might make.

In a Chapter 7 case, a corporation or partnership does not receive a bankruptcy discharge, whereas an individual may (see ). Once all assets of the corporate or partnership debtor have been fully administered, the case is closed. The debts of the corporation or partnership theoretically continue to exist until applicable statutory periods of limitations expire.

== For individuals ==
Individuals who reside, have a place of business, or own property in the United States may file for bankruptcy in a federal court under Chapter 7 (&quot;straight bankruptcy&quot;, or liquidation). Chapter 7, as with other bankruptcy chapters, is not available to individuals who have had bankruptcy cases dismissed within the prior 180 days under specified circumstances.

In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the individual is allowed to keep certain exempt property. Most liens, however (such as real estate mortgages and security interests for car loans), survive. The value of property that can be claimed as exempt varies from state to state. Other assets, if any, are sold (&quot;liquidated&quot;) by the trustee to repay creditors. Many types of unsecured debt are legally discharged by the bankruptcy proceeding, but there are various types of debt that are not discharged in a Chapter 7. Common exceptions to discharge include child support, income taxes less than three years old, property taxes, student loans (unless the debtor prevails in a difficult-to-win adversary proceeding brought to determine the dischargeability of the student loan), and fines and restitution imposed by a court for any crimes committed by the debtor. Spousal support is likewise not covered by a bankruptcy filing, nor are property settlements through divorce. Despite their potential non-dischargeability, all debts must be listed on bankruptcy schedules.

A Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on an individual&#x27;s credit report for ten years from the date of filing the Chapter 7 petition. This contrasts with a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which stays on an individual&#x27;s credit report for seven years from the date of filing the Chapter 13 petition. This may make credit less available or may make lending terms less favorable, although high debt can have the same effect. That must be balanced against the removal of actual debt from the filer&#x27;s record by the bankruptcy, which tends to improve creditworthiness. Consumer credit and creditworthiness is a complex subject, however. Future ability to obtain credit is dependent on multiple factors and difficult to predict.

Another aspect to consider is whether the debtor can avoid a challenge by the United States Trustee to his or her Chapter 7 filing as &quot;abusive&quot;. One factor in considering whether the U.S. Trustee can prevail in a challenge to the debtor&#x27;s Chapter 7 filing is whether the debtor can otherwise afford to repay some or all of his debts out of disposable income in the five year time frame provided by Chapter 13. If so, then the U.S. Trustee may succeed in preventing the debtor from receiving a discharge under Chapter 7, effectively forcing the debtor into Chapter 13.

Some bankruptcy practitioners assert that the U.S. Trustee has become more aggressive in recent times in pursuing (what the U.S. Trustee believes to be) &quot;abusive&quot; Chapter 7 filings. Through these activities the U.S. Trustee has achieved a regulatory system that Congress and most creditor-friendly commenters have consistently espoused, i.e., a formal means test for Chapter 7. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 has clarified this area of concern by making changes to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that include, along with many other reforms, language imposing a means test for Chapter 7 cases.

Creditworthiness and the likelihood of receiving a Chapter 7 discharge are some of the issues to be considered in determining whether to file bankruptcy. The effect of bankruptcy on creditworthiness in many cases might not be significant, because by the time many debtors are ready to file for bankruptcy, their credit score is already extremely low. Also, new credit extended post-petition is not covered by the discharge, so creditors may offer new credit to the newly-bankrupt.

== Methods of filing ==
Official Federal bankruptcy forms are prescribed in the relevant Rules, and are a computer based equivalent option of paper forms. Software can also be used, which generates court-ready forms and is more simple for users. Bankruptcy petition preparers can aid in completing applications, as can a bankruptcy attorney.

== BAPCPA revisions ==

On October 17, 2005, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) went into effect. This legislation was the biggest reform to the bankruptcy laws since 1978. The legislation was enacted after years of lobbying efforts by banks and lending institutions and was intended to prevent abuses of the bankruptcy laws.

The changes to Chapter 7 were extensive.

=== Means test ===
The most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within. The amendments effectively subject most debtors who have an income, as calculated by the Code, above the debtor&#x27;s state census median income to a 60-month disposable income based test. This test is referred to as the &quot;means test&quot;. The means test provides for a finding of abuse if the debtor&#x27;s disposable monthly income is higher than a specified floor amount or portion of their debts. If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may only be rebutted in the case of &quot;special circumstances.&quot; Debtors whose income is below the state&#x27;s median income are not subject to the means test. Under this test, any debtor with more than $182.50 in monthly disposable income, under the formula, would face a presumption of abuse.

Notably, the Code-calculated income is based on the prior six months and may be higher or lower than the debtor&#x27;s actual current income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code&#x27;s &quot;current monthly income&quot; as &quot;presumed income&quot;. If the debtor&#x27;s debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable. The inapplicability to non-consumer debt allows business debtors to &quot;abuse&quot; credit without repercussion unless the court finds &quot;cause.&quot;

&quot;Special circumstances&quot; does not confer judicial discretion; rather, it gives a debtor an opportunity to adjust income by documenting additional expenses or loss of income in situations caused by a medical condition or being called or order to active military service. However, the assumption of abuse is only rebutted where the additional expenses or adjustments for loss of income are significant enough to change the outcome of the means test. Otherwise, abuse is still presumed despite the &quot;special circumstances.&quot;

=== Credit counseling ===
Another major change to the law enacted by BAPCPA deals with eligibility. §109(h) provides that a debtor will no longer be eligible to file under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 unless within 180 days prior to filing, the debtor received an &quot;individual or group briefing&quot; from a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator.
The new legislation also requires that all individual debtors in either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 complete an &quot;instructional course concerning personal financial management.&quot; If a Chapter 7 debtor does not complete the course, this constitutes grounds for denial of discharge pursuant to new §727(a)(11). The financial management program is experimental and the effectiveness of the program is to be studied for 18 months. Theoretically, if the educational courses prove to be ineffective, the requirement may disappear.

=== Applicability of exemptions ===
BAPCPA attempted to eliminate the perceived &quot;forum shopping&quot; by changing the rules on claiming exemptions. Under BAPCPA, a debtor who has moved from one state to another within two years of filing (730 days) the bankruptcy case must use exemptions from the place of the debtor&#x27;s domicile for the majority of the 180-day period preceding the two years (730 days) before the filing §522(b)(3). If the new residency requirement would render the debtor ineligible for any exemption, then the debtor can choose the federal exemptions.

BAPCPA also &quot;capped&quot; the amount of a homestead exemption that a debtor can claim in bankruptcy, despite state exemption statutes. Also, there is a &quot;cap&quot; placed upon the homestead exemption in situations where the debtor, within 1,215 days (about 3 years and 4 months) preceding the bankruptcy case, added value to a homestead. The provision provides that &quot;any value in excess of $125,000&quot; added to a homestead can not be exempted. The only exception is if the value was transferred from another homestead within the same state or if the homestead is the principal residence of a family farmer (§522(p)). This &quot;cap&quot; would apply in situations where a debtor has purchased a new homestead in a different state, or where the debtor has increased the value to his or her homestead (presumably through a remodeling or addition).

=== Lien avoidance ===
Some types of liens may be avoided through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. However, BAPCPA limited the ability of debtors to avoid liens through bankruptcy. The definition of &quot;household goods&quot; was changed limiting &quot;electronic equipment&quot; to one radio, one television, one VCR, and one personal computer with related equipment. The definition now excludes works of art not created by the debtor or a relative of the debtor, jewelry worth more than $500 (except wedding rings), and motor vehicles (§522(f)(1)(B)). Prior to BAPCPA, the definition of household goods was broader so that more items could have been included, including more than one television, VCR, radio, etc.

=== Other changes ===
* Decreased the number and type of debts that could be discharged in bankruptcy. Decreased limits for discharge of debts incurred discharging luxury goods. Expanded the scope of student loans not dischargeable without undue hardship.
* Increase the time in which a debtor may have multiple discharges from 6 to 8 years.
* Limited the duration of the automatic stay, particularly for debtors who had filed within one year of a previous bankruptcy. Automatic stay may be extended at the discretion of the court.
* BAPCPA limited the applicability of the automatic stay in eviction proceedings. If the landlord has already obtained a judgment of possession prior to the bankruptcy case being filed, a debtor must deposit an escrow for rent with the Bankruptcy Court, and the stay may be lifted if the debtor does not pay the landlord in full within 30 days thereafter, §362(b)(22). The stay also would not apply in a situation where the eviction is based on &quot;endangerment&quot; of the rented property or &quot;illegal use of controlled substances&quot; on the property, §362(b)(23).
* BAPCPA enacts a provision that protects creditors from monetary penalties for violating the stay if the debtor did not give &quot;effective&quot; notice pursuant to [§342(g)]. The new notice provisions require the debtor to give notice of the bankruptcy to the creditor at an &quot;address filed by the creditor with the court&quot; or &quot;at an address stated in two communications from the creditor to the debtor within 90 days of the filing of the bankruptcy case&quot;.

<text>The King&#x27;s Highway was a roughly road laid out from 1650 to 1735 in the American colonies. It was built on the order of Charles II of England, who directed his colonial governors to link Charleston, South Carolina, and Boston, Massachusetts. The section north of New York City, laid out on January 22, 1673, became the Upper Boston Post Road. The road was finally completed in 1735. Much of the Post Road is now U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 20.

The King&#x27;s Highway Historic District in New Jersey covers U.S. Route 206 and New Jersey Route 27, connecting Lawrenceville with Kingston through Princeton. In Pennsylvania, much of the route is now U.S. Route 13. (In Philadelphia, Route 13 becomes Frankford Avenue.) Through Maryland, the King&#x27;s Highway largely follows U.S. Route 1. From Virginia southward, the modern U.S. Route 17 has many segments that follow the old King&#x27;s Highway.

==History==
The Boston Post Road was a system of mail-delivery routes between New York City and Boston that evolved into the first major highways in the United States. Some routes followed trails in use by Native Americans long before Europeans arrived. Some of these important native trails had been used long enough that they were two feet below the surrounding woodland.

Following a trail known as the Pequot Path, the Upper Post Road was first laid out in 1673. Used by post riders to deliver the mail, it was later widened and smoothed so that horse-drawn wagons or stagecoaches could use it. During the 19th century, turnpike companies took over and improved pieces of the road. Large sections of the various routes are still called the &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; and &quot;Boston Post Road&quot;.

In 1761, Postmaster General Benjamin Franklin ordered milestones placed along the route from Boston to Saco, Maine, then to Machias, as a northern extension of King&#x27;s Highway. As part of his duties, Franklin conducted inspections of the roads that were used for delivering mail as settlements along the coast increased. One method of charging for mail service was by mileage, so Franklin invented an odometer to measure mileage more accurately. The King&#x27;s Highway, as a result, morphed into the Post Road.

<doc id="63480" wikidata="Q155339" url="?curid=63480" title="The Eminem Show">
<text>The Eminem Show is the fourth studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on May 26, 2002, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. The album saw Eminem take a predominant production role, including the album&#x27;s four hit singles: &quot;Without Me&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Cleanin&#x27; Out My Closet&quot;, and &quot;Sing for the Moment&quot;. Guest appearances include Obie Trice, D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Dina Rae, and Eminem&#x27;s daughter, Hailie Jade.

The album incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem&#x27;s previous albums, and its themes are predominantly based on Eminem&#x27;s prominence in hip-hop culture, as well as his ambivalent thoughts of fame. The album also features political commentary on the United States, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the war on terror, President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; was regarded as Eminem&#x27;s most personal album at the time and a step back from the Slim Shady alter ego.

Widely considered the most anticipated album of 2002, &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and stood there for six non-consecutive weeks. It sold over 1.3 million copies in its second week in the US, where it registered a full week of sales. It also topped the UK Albums Chart for five consecutive weeks. It produced four commercially successful singles, &quot;Without Me&quot;, &quot;Cleanin&#x27; Out My Closet&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Sing for the Moment&quot;, and it features one of his most popular songs, &quot;&#x27;Till I Collapse&quot;. The album was met with widespread acclaim, with praise directed at Eminem&#x27;s mature, introspective lyricism and the album&#x27;s experimental production.

&quot;The Eminem Show&quot; was both the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States and the best-selling album worldwide of 2002, along with being the best-selling hip-hop album in music history, and Eminem&#x27;s most commercially successful album to date. The album was certified 12× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its worldwide sales of 27 million copies make it one of the best-selling albums of all time and the second best-selling album of the 21st century. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album, while &quot;Without Me&quot; won Best Music Video. &quot;Blender&quot;, &quot;Muzik&quot; and &quot;LAUNCH&quot; named it the best album of 2002, and several publications named it among the best albums of the decade.

==Background==
Speaking to &quot;Spin&quot;, Eminem said, &quot;Eventually, I might need some drama in my life to inspire me [...] With &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, everything that everybody was saying–I took that, and it was my ammo. And then when shit died down a little bit, I had other turmoil in my personal life, so that was what I was able to dump out on &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;. Now, I just gotta wait for the next phase of my life. But something always seems to happen, man; something&#x27;s always gotta be fucking turbulent.&quot;

Eminem cited that the inspiration for the album was taken from the Peter Weir-directed 1998 science fiction comedy-drama film &quot;The Truman Show&quot;. Jim Carrey starred in the film as the lead character Truman Burbank, a man who unwittingly lives inside a TV show, where his life is broadcast to viewers around the world. Eminem spoke on the film&#x27;s influence, saying, &quot;My life felt like it was becoming a circus around that time, and I felt like I was always being watched [...] Basically, Jim Carrey wrote my album.&quot;

==Recording==
Speaking with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2002, Eminem said Sing for the Moment&#x27; was the first song I wrote for the album; &#x27;Cleanin Out My Closet&#x27; was the second. I had the line in &#x27;Cleanin Out My Closet&#x27; — &#x27;I&#x27;d like to welcome y&#x27;all out to &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;—and it was just a line, but I sat back and I was like, &#x27;My life is really like a fucking show&#x27;. I have songs on the album that I wrote when I was in that shit last year, with a possible jail sentence hangin&#x27; over my head and all the emotions going through the divorce. I went through a lot of shit last year [lawsuits, divorce and the threat of jail time] that I resolved at the same time, all in the same year. And, yeah, that&#x27;s when half of the album was wrote&quot;.

Eminem had started recording the album around the same time he was filming &quot;8 Mile&quot;. Production was used for both the soundtrack of the film and his album. The album also saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass co-producing several tracks (mainly the songs which eventually became the released singles). Dr. Dre, in addition to being the album&#x27;s executive producer, produced only three individual tracks: &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Say What You Say&quot;, and &quot;My Dad&#x27;s Gone Crazy&quot;. Regarding his increase in producing, Eminem told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;I actually know how to program a drum machine now. It used to be so simple—just writing lyrics and raps, laying vocals and leaving the studio was great. But now that I&#x27;m so into producing, it&#x27;s a fucking job.&quot;

==Singles==
&quot;Without Me&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on May 14, 2002.

&quot;Cleanin&#x27; Out My Closet&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on July 29 of that same year. Releasing singles from this album went on a hiatus when &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; (one of the singles from 2002 soundtrack, &quot;8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture&quot;) was released on October 28.

Releasing singles from this album resumed when &quot;Superman&quot; (which features Dina Rae) was released as the third single on January 21, 2003.

&quot;Sing for the Moment&quot; was released as the fourth single on February 25 of that same year.

&quot;Business&quot; was released as the fifth and final single on July 22, though it was unreleased in the United States.

==Music and lyrics==
Stylistically, &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; has a lighter tone than &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; and incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem&#x27;s previous albums, featuring mixed guitar-driven melodies with hip-hop rhythms. In an interview with British magazine &quot;The Face&quot; in April 2002, Eminem said that he treated the album like it was a rock record. He continued that he &quot;tried to get the best of both worlds&quot; on the album. Eminem spoke on specific rock influences, saying, &quot;I listened to a lot of &#x27;70s rock growing up, when I was real little. When I go back and listen to them songs, like Led Zeppelin or Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix...&#x27;70s rock had this incredible feel to it.&quot; Notably, &quot;Sing For The Moment&quot; contains a sample of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Dream On&quot; as well as a reinterpretation of its guitar solo. Another rock sample on the album is the kick-clap beat of &quot;&#x27;Till I Collapse&quot;, which is an interpolation of the intro from Queen&#x27;s &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;.

The themes of &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; are predominantly based on Eminem&#x27;s prominence in hip-hop culture and the subsequent envy towards him, as well as his thoughts on his unexpected enormous success and its consequential negative effects on his life. The album also touches on Eminem&#x27;s thoughts on themes surrounding American politics, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the war on terror President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Speaking on his use of political commentary on the album, Eminem told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;You put your shit out there for the world to see and to judge, and whoever agrees with you agrees with you. Even my most die-hard fans don&#x27;t agree with everything I say. These are my views, this is how I see it. You may have your own opinion, but you may not get to project it to the world like I do.&quot; Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, rock critic Alan Light said that the album may have proved that Eminem is the most &quot;dexterous, vivid writer in pop music&quot;. The album also sees Eminem dissing several artists, including Mariah Carey, Moby, Canibus and Limp Bizkit, while Dr. Dre disses Jermaine Dupri on the song &quot;Say What You Say&quot;.

Lyrically, the album displays a dramatic shift from the misogynistic and homophobic lyrics presented on &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;. Eminem told &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;One of the frustrating things was people saying, &#x27;He&#x27;s got to cuss to sell records,&#x27; [...] That&#x27;s why with this album, I toned it down a bit as far as shock value. I wanted to show that I&#x27;m a solid artist, and I&#x27;m here to stay.&quot; Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; was regarded as a departure from Eminem&#x27;s previous albums with it being more personal and reflective and a step back of the Slim Shady alter ego. Eminem said during an interview with MTV that he felt that &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; was his &quot;best record so far&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; said that Eminem&#x27;s first two albums &quot;aired dirty laundry, then the world&#x27;s most celebrated rapper [Eminem] examined life in the hall of mirrors he&#x27;d built for himself.&quot;

With the release of &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;, Eminem was considered to be more socially acceptable: there were no protests over his lyrics, boycotts, and talk shows discussing his impact on America&#x27;s youth. A columnist of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; wrote that Eminem had become a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; for baby boomers, describing him as &quot;the most compelling figure to have emerged from popular music since the holy trinity of [Bob] Dylan, [John] Lennon, and [Mick] Jagger.&quot;

===Censored version===
The &quot;clean version&quot; of &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; censors many more profanities and derogatory words than in clean versions of Eminem&#x27;s previous albums, in which the words &quot;goddamn&quot;, &quot;prick&quot;, &quot;bastard&quot;, &quot;piss&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;ass&quot;, and &quot;shit&quot; were allowed. This album allowed no profanities, and the profanities were either muted, obscured by sound effects, or back-masked. In addition to this, entire sentences were sometimes removed from the censored version for being very sexually charged. The entire song &quot;Drips&quot; was removed in early clean versions and is heard only as four seconds of silence moving on to the next track, &quot;Without Me&quot;. Later on, digital releases of the clean version removed &quot;Drips&quot; completely, moving the next 11 songs up on the tracklist. Some copies of the clean version, however, feature an edited version of &quot;Drips&quot;.

There are some inconsistencies in the clean version&#x27;s censorship. In the skit &quot;The Kiss&quot;, Eminem&#x27;s shouting of the word &quot;motherfucker!&quot; is still audible in the censored version. In the track, &quot;Soldier&quot;, which is a continuation of &quot;The Kiss&quot;, the word &quot;bitch&quot; was used three times, and can be clearly heard once. Also, in &quot;White America&quot;, the word &quot;flag&quot; is back masked when he raps, &quot;To burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Eminem Show&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 20 reviews.

Alex Needham of &quot;NME&quot; hailed &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; as a &quot;fantastic third album&quot; that &quot;is bigger, bolder and far more consistent than its predecessors&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt the album&#x27;s more personal lyrics &quot;succeed in fleshing out Eminem&#x27;s complexities and contradictions&quot;, nonetheless concluding that &quot;[l]ike its predecessors, though, &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; is a testament to the skills of its star. The sludgy rapping of such guests as D12 only confirms Eminem&#x27;s dizzying prowess, gob-spewing individuality, and wickedly prankish humor.&quot; Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kris Ex argued that Eminem &quot;may have made the best rap-rock album in history&quot;.

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani wrote that he &quot;peels back some of the bullshit façade and reveals a little bit of the real Marshall Mathers&quot; on an album that &quot;displays a—dare I say it?—more &#x27;mature&#x27; Eminem.&quot; In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the album &quot;proves Eminem is the gold standard in pop music in 2002, delivering stylish, catchy, dense, funny, political music that rarely panders&quot;. Critic Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;I think it represents an articulate, coherent, formally appropriate response to Eminem&#x27;s changing position and role, one that acknowledges the privileges and alienations that accrue to all fame as well as the resolution of Marshall Mathers&#x27;s worst traumas and the specifics of his success.&quot;

Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that Eminem is &quot;as good as he gets but in the end inflicts more damage on himself, hoisting &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; to a level of self-absorption rivaled only by Woody Allen&quot;, and despite the presence of some mediocre tracks, he &quot;displays an admirable dexterity in blending invective and invention, even though his approach is more reactionary than revolutionary.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote, &quot;Behind the hype and the swagger, he&#x27;s still baring enough of his soul for &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; to be compelling theatre.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; was more mixed in its assessment, stating that as &quot;Eminem outgrows his old alter-id, so the obligatory pantomime villainy, skits and crass cameos by Shady Records signings become a hindrance.&quot; Marc L. Hill of &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that the album lacked the shock factor of his previous albums and described it as &quot;a disappointing combination of promising musical experimentation and uninspired lyrics.&quot;

&quot;Blender&quot; named &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; the best album of 2002. The album became Eminem&#x27;s third to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, while &quot;Without Me&quot; won Eminem his first Best Music Video award. The album swept the MTV Music Video Awards, winning four awards for Best Male Video, Video of the Year, Best Direction, and Best Rap Video. The album also won Best Album at the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, both Album of the Year and Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Album at the 2002 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, both Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the 2003 American Music Awards, Best International Album at the 2003 Brit Awards, and International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2003.

===Legacy and reappraisal===
&quot;The Eminem Show&quot; received critical praise by most music critics and is often debated as Eminem&#x27;s most personal and best work. The album cemented Eminem&#x27;s &quot;three-peat&quot; of classic hip-hop albums, following the critical appraisal of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; and &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 317 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and was later ranked at number 84 on the same magazine&#x27;s Best Albums of the 2000s Decade. In 2007, it was ranked number 63 by The National Association of Recording Merchandisers, in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their list of the Definite 200 Albums of All Time. In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; magazine deemed it a &quot;classic&quot; album that &quot;cemented Eminem&#x27;s place as one of the most important figures in rap history&quot;, and has included it on their list of 100 Best Albums of the &quot;Complex&quot; Decade, placing it at number 5. Following the 15th anniversary of the album, the Grammy Awards also described &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; as a &quot;classic album&quot;. &quot;Popdose&quot; ranked the album at 79 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. In 2015, &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; was ranked number 56 on the Greatest of All Time &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Eminem Show&quot; was originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002; however, pirated and bootlegged copies appeared online via peer-to-peer networks and began surfacing on the streets. It was provided by Rabid Neurosis (RNS), an MP3 warez release organisation who pirated the album twenty-five days prior to release. Radio show &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; broadcast the entire album on May 17, 2002. Interscope decided to release the album earlier than planned, on May 28 to prevent bootlegging. However, many stores in the United States began selling it even earlier than the new release date on Sunday, May 26, and some put the album out as early as Friday. Promotional posters in stores read, &quot;America Couldn&#x27;t Wait&quot;. Due to the premature release by many retailers on a Sunday, the album had only one day of official sales for the chart week and was unavailable in Walmart stores during that period. &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; was Eminem&#x27;s first album to include lyrics to all its songs inside the CD booklet. Additionally, the first 2,000,000 copies of the album shipped in the United States included a bonus DVD with an exclusive interview and live footage. A week before the album&#x27;s release, it was the second-most played CD on computers, the highest ranking ever for an unreleased title. It was considered the most anticipated album of 2002.

Despite the confusion over the exact release date, the album still managed to have a very successful debut on the charts. &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling approximately 284,000 copies in its first day, marking the first time an album had topped the chart from only a day&#x27;s sale. It sold 1,322,000 copies in the following week, its first full week of sales, then sold 809,000 copies in its third week and 529,562 copies in its fourth week to bring its four-week sales total to just under 3 million copies. The album sold 381,000 copies in its fifth week and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for a fifth and final consecutive week. On March 7, 2011, the album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping 10 million copies, making it Eminem&#x27;s second album to receive a Diamond certification in the United States. It has also achieved Diamond certification in Canada and 18× Platinum in Australia.

&quot;The Eminem Show&quot; has sold 27 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and Eminem&#x27;s best-selling album. It reached number one in 18 other countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The album also spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart.

== Expanded edition ==
On May 24, 2022, Eminem announced the release of the expanded edition of the album on his social media to celebrate its 20th anniversary. On May 26, 2022, Eminem released the new expanded edition, which contains instrumentals of selected tracks, freestyles and live versions of songs from previous albums performed with his longtime friend and collaborator Proof at Tramps, New York and Fuji Rock Festival, Japan. It also features four new tracks which were recorded during the initial recording sessions but not included in the original version of the album; &quot;Stimulate&quot;, which was kept off the album due to time constraints and instead appeared on the bonus disc of the &quot;8 Mile&quot; soundtrack album, &quot;Bump Heads&quot; and &quot;The Conspiracy Freestyle&quot; (which had appeared on other Shady Records releases), and an unreleased song, &quot;Jimmy, Brian and Mike&quot;, which had a verse and chorus re-recorded by Eminem especially for the expanded edition. Physical versions of the expanded edition were released later in the year, including a 4xLP vinyl set, CD, and cassette. Along with &quot;Curtain Call 2&quot;, it was nominated for an Outstanding Anthology/Compilation/Reissue at the 2023 Detroit Music Awards.

<text>A show [[cat]] (also known as a [[purebred cat]] or [[pedigreed cat]]) is one that has been judged to be close to the physical ideal for its breed standard at a cat show. Not all pedigreed cats are show cats, many are just pets but the ones with the best conformation and personality are often shown in associations such as the CFA and TICA in the US, the GCCF in the UK or the FiFe in the rest of Europe. Uncommonly, a prize-winning pedigreed show cat can be worth thousands of dollars but most are loved pets. In order to compare examples of breeds and improve stock, cat shows are held where judges evaluate the cats according to a breed standard. Pedigreed cats are often identified with microchip implants.
== Issues ==

=== Health ===
A common conception is that all pedigreed cats are less healthy than random-bred cats due to inbreeding. The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random-bred Populations by Lipinski et al. showed that pedigreed cats are more inbred than random bred cats. For some breeds such as Singapura and Burmese the genetic diversity is very low. Some breeders take great care to select for the healthiest animals, and this has the potential to reduce the incidence of health issues. An example of this is blindness in the Abyssinian caused by PRA, which have been reduced from 45% to less than 4% in 2008. Many of the worst, like PKD in Persians, Hip Dysplasia in British Shorthairs and Maine Coons, HCM in Maine Coons, Persians, Exotic Shorthair, British Shorthair, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ragdoll and Bengal, are still present in high frequencies. The frequency of HCM in British Shorthairs are 2.1% for females and 20.4% for males. The frequency of Hip Dysplasia in Maine Coons is 36.3% or 30.2%. Some breeders use preventive screening, but no studies documenting possible reductions in prevalences exists.

=== Breeding ===
Generally, breeds are established using few cats as founders and outcrossing is mostly not allowed. It is also normal that breeds go through population bottlenecks because of the popular sire syndrome. It is quite normal that cats winning in shows are found attractive to breeders and these cats end up being overused and eventually they are present many or perhaps all pedigrees many times. This population structure is addressed in Patterns of molecular genetic variation among cat breeds. Quote - &quot;As a consequence of small effective population sizes, founder effects, and population bottlenecks, cat breeds have become repositories of spontaneous mutations causative of hereditary disease.&quot; One example is the presence of the mutation R820W, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), in 30% of all Ragdolls.

Breeds have different origins, some are manmade or the result of mutation, while others are found in nature. Some breeds of cat have been created by taking a single or queen with an unusual physical characteristic that breeds true. The entire Cornish Rex breed can be traced back to a single parent animal with an unusual genetic mutation producing a curly coat. Both the Burmese and Tonkinese breeds can be traced back to a single cat, Wong Mau, which was brought from Burma in the 1930s. Breeders continually strive to eliminate negative characteristics that various cat breeds exhibit as the breeds are developed. There is not really any such thing as a &#x27;purebred&#x27; cat since all registered breeds began as random-bred cats. In this case, &#x27;pedigreed&#x27; is a more accurate term.

=== Meeting breed standards ===
Cat breeders are continually competing to find the &#x27;ideal&#x27; of the breed – the cats that come closest to fitting the breed standard. Because of this, the physical characteristics of a prize-winning show cat have gradually changed in some breeds. This genetic shifting is most obvious in the two oldest, most popular and most distinctive breeds of show cat - the Persian and the Siamese. However, some show cats are naturally occurring breeds that are perpetuated to keep the original look of a cat from a particular region. Examples are the Maine Coon and Turkish Van.

<doc id="63491" wikidata="Q2037014" url="?curid=63491" title="Bill James">
<text>George William James (born October 5, 1949) is an American baseball writer, historian, and statistician whose work has been widely influential. Since 1977, James has written more than two dozen books about baseball history and statistics. His approach, which he named sabermetrics after the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), scientifically analyzes and studies baseball, often through the use of statistical data, in an attempt to determine why teams win and lose.

In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named him in the &quot;Time&quot; 100 as one of the most influential people in the world. In 2003, James was hired as senior advisor on Baseball Operations for the Boston Red Sox and worked for the team for 17 years during which they won four World Series championships.

==Early life==
James was born in Holton, Kansas. He joined the United States Army in 1971. After his service, he graduated from the University of Kansas in 1973 with degrees in English and economics, and in 1975 with a degree in education.

==Career==

===&quot;The Bill James Baseball Abstract&quot;s===
An aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles in his mid-twenties after leaving the United States Army. Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing night shifts as a security guard at the Stokely-Van Camp&#x27;s pork and beans cannery. Unlike most writers, his pieces did not recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players. A typical James piece posed a question (&quot;e.g.,&quot; &quot;Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?&quot;), and then presented data and analysis that offered an answer.

Editors considered James&#x27;s pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James began self-publishing an annual book titled &quot;The Bill James Baseball Abstract&quot;, beginning in 1977. The first edition, titled &quot;1977 Baseball Abstract: Featuring 18 categories of statistical information that you just can&#x27;t find anywhere else&quot;, presented 68 pages of in-depth statistics compiled from James&#x27;s study of box scores from the preceding season and was offered for sale through a small advertisement in &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. Seventy-five people purchased the booklet. The 1978 edition, subtitled &quot;The 2nd annual edition of baseball&#x27;s most informative and imaginative review&quot;, sold 250 copies. Beginning in 1979, James wrote an annual preview of the baseball season for &quot;Esquire&quot;, and continued to do so through 1984.

The first three editions of the &quot;Baseball Abstract&quot; garnered respect for James&#x27;s work, including a very favorable review by Daniel Okrent in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. New annual editions added essays on teams and players. By 1982 sales had increased tenfold, and a media conglomerate agreed to publish and distribute future editions.

While writers had published books about baseball statistics before (most notably Earnshaw Cook&#x27;s &quot;Percentage Baseball&quot;, in the 1960s), few had ever reached a mass audience. Attempts to imitate James&#x27;s work spawned a flood of books and articles that continues to this day.

===Post-&quot;Abstract&quot;s work===
In 1988, James ceased writing the &quot;Abstract&quot;, citing workload-related burnout and concern about the volume of statistics on the market. He has continued to publish hardcover books about baseball history, which have sold well and received admiring reviews. These books include three editions of &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot; (1985, 1988, 2001, the last entitled &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;).

James has also written several series of new annuals:
* &quot;The Baseball Book&quot; (1990–1992) was a loosely organized collection of commentary, profiles, historical articles, and occasional pieces of research. James&#x27;s assistant Rob Neyer was responsible for much of the research, and wrote several short pieces. Neyer went on to become a featured baseball columnist at ESPN and SB Nation.
* &quot;The Player Ratings Book&quot; (1993–95) offered statistics and 50-word profiles aimed at the fantasy baseball enthusiast.
* The Bill James Handbook (2003–present) provides past-season statistics and next-season projections for Major League players and teams, and career data for all current Major League players. Results for the Fielding Bible Awards, an alternative to the Gold Glove Awards voted on by a 10-person panel that includes James, are also included.
* The Bill James Gold Mine (2008–2010) was a collection of new essays and never-before-seen statistics, as well as profiles of players and teams.
* Playing off the name of the earlier series, &quot;Solid Fool&#x27;s Gold: Detours on the Way to Conventional Wisdom&quot; (2011) was a mixed collection of both baseball-related and miscellaneous pieces, culled from the Bill James Online archives (see below).

In 2008, James launched Bill James Online. Subscribers could read James&#x27;s new, original writing and interact with one another—as well as with James—in a question-and-answer format. The web site also offered new &quot;profiles&quot; of teams and players full of facts and statistics that hoped to map what James has termed &quot;the lost island of baseball statistics&quot;. On June 9, 2023, James wrote an article for the site announcing that it would soon be closed in order for James to &quot;focus on other projects&quot;.

===STATS, Inc.===
In an essay published in the 1984 &quot;Abstract&quot;, James vented his frustration about Major League Baseball&#x27;s refusal to publish play-by-play accounts of every game. James proposed the creation of Project Scoresheet, a network of fans that would work together to collect and distribute this information.

While the resulting non-profit organization never functioned smoothly, it worked well enough to collect accounts of every game from 1984 through 1991. James&#x27;s publisher agreed to distribute two annuals of essays and data—the 1987 and 1988 editions of &quot;Bill James Presents The Great American Baseball Statbook&quot; (though only the first of these featured writing by James).

The organization was eventually disbanded, but many of its members went on to form for-profit companies with similar goals and structure. STATS, Inc., the company James joined, provided data and analysis to every major media outlet before being acquired by Fox Sports in 2001.

==Innovations==
Among the statistical innovations attributable to James are:
* Runs created. A statistic intended to quantify a player&#x27;s contribution to runs scored, as well as a team&#x27;s expected number of runs scored. Runs created is calculated from other offensive statistics. James&#x27;s first version of it was: formula_1 Applied to an entire team or league, the statistic correlates closely (usually within 5%) to that team&#x27;s or league&#x27;s actual runs scored. Since James first created the statistic, sabermetricians have refined it to make it more accurate, and it is now used in many different variations.
* Range factor. A statistic that quantifies the defensive contribution of a player, calculated in its simplest form as (A is an assist, PO is a putout): formula_2 The statistic is premised on the notion that the total number of outs that a player participates in is more relevant in evaluating his defensive play than the percentage of cleanly handled chances as calculated by the conventional statistic fielding percentage.
* Defensive Efficiency Rating. A statistic that shows the percentage of balls in play a defense turns into an out. It is used to help determine a team&#x27;s defensive ability. The formula is: formula_3
* Win shares. A unifying statistic intended to allow the comparison of players at different positions, as well as players of different eras. Win Shares incorporates a variety of pitching, hitting and fielding statistics. One drawback of Win Shares is the difficulty of computing it.
* Pythagorean Winning Percentage. A statistic explaining the relationship of wins and losses to runs scored and runs allowed. The statistic correlates closely to a team&#x27;s actual winning percentage. Its simplest formula is: formula_4
* Game score is a metric to determine the strength of a pitcher in any particular baseball game. It has since been improved by Tom Tango.
* Major League Equivalency. A metric that uses minor league statistics to predict how a player is likely to perform at the major league level.
* The Brock2 System. A system for projecting a player&#x27;s performance over the remainder of his career based on past performance and the aging process.
* Similarity scores. Scoring a player&#x27;s statistical similarity to other players, providing a frame of reference for players of the distant past. Examples: Lou Gehrig comparable to Don Mattingly; Joe Jackson to Tony Oliva.
* Secondary average. A statistic that attempts to measure a player&#x27;s contribution to an offense in ways not reflected in batting average. Secondary averages tend to be similar to batting averages, but can vary wildly, from less than .100 to more than .500 in extreme cases. The formula is (ISO is isolated power): formula_5
* Power/Speed Number. A statistic that attempts to consolidate the various &quot;clubs&quot; of players with impressive numbers of both home runs and stolen bases (e.g., the 30–30 club (Bobby Bonds was well known for being a member), the 40–40 club (Jose Canseco was the first to perform this feat), and even the 25–65 club (Joe Morgan in the &#x27;70s)). The formula is: formula_6
* Approximate Value. A system of cutoffs designed to estimate the value a player contributed to various category groups (including his team) to study broad questions such as &quot;how do players age over time&quot;.
* &quot;Temperature gauge&quot; to determine how &quot;hot&quot; a player is, based on recent performance. The gauge has been used in NESN Red Sox telecasts and has provoked mixed reactions from critics.

Although James may be best known as an inventor of statistical tools, he has often written on the limitations of statistics and urged humility concerning their place amid other kinds of information about baseball. To James, context is paramount: he was among the first to emphasize the importance of adjusting traditional statistics for park factors and to stress the role of luck in a pitcher&#x27;s win–loss record. Many of his statistical innovations are arguably less important than the underlying ideas. When he introduced the notion of secondary average, it was as a vehicle for the then-counterintuitive concept that batting average represents only a fraction of a player&#x27;s offensive contribution. (The runs-created statistic plays a similar role vis-à-vis the traditional RBI.) Some of his contributions to the language of baseball, like the idea of the &quot;defensive spectrum&quot;, border on being entirely non-statistical.

==Acceptance and employment in mainstream baseball==
Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane began applying sabermetric principles to running his low-budget team in the early 2000s, to notable effect, as chronicled in Michael Lewis&#x27; book &quot;&quot;.

In 2003, James was hired by a former reader, John Henry, the new owner of the Boston Red Sox.

One point of controversy was in handling the relief pitching of the Red Sox. James had previously published analysis of the use of the closer in baseball, and had concluded that the traditional use of the closer both overrated the abilities of that individual and used him in suboptimal circumstances. He wrote that it is &quot;far better to use your relief ace when the score is tied, even if that is the seventh inning, than in the ninth inning with a lead of two or more runs.&quot; The Red Sox in 2003 staffed their bullpen with several marginally talented relievers. Red Sox manager Grady Little was never fully comfortable with the setup, and designated unofficial closers and reshuffled roles after a bad outing. When Boston lost a number of games due to bullpen failures, Little reverted to a traditional closer approach and moved Byung-hyun Kim from being a starting pitcher to a closer. The Red Sox did not follow James&#x27;s idea of a bullpen with no closer, but with consistent overall talent that would allow the responsibilities to be shared. Red Sox reliever Alan Embree thought the plan could have worked if the bullpen had not suffered injuries. During the 2004 regular season Keith Foulke was used primarily as a closer in the conventional model; however, Foulke&#x27;s usage in the 2004 postseason was along the lines of a relief ace with multiple inning appearances at pivotal times of the game. Houston Astros manager Phil Garner also employed a relief ace model with his use of Brad Lidge in the 2004 postseason.

During his tenure with the Red Sox, James published several new sabermetric books (see #Bibliography below). Indeed, although James was typically tight-lipped about his activities on behalf of the Red Sox, he is credited with advocating some of the moves that led to the team&#x27;s first World Series championship in 86 years, including the signing of non-tendered free agent David Ortiz, the trade for Mark Bellhorn, and the team&#x27;s increased emphasis on on-base percentage.

After the Red Sox suffered through a disastrous 2012 season, Henry stated that James had fallen &quot;out of favor [in the front office] over the last few years for reasons I really don&#x27;t understand. We&#x27;ve gotten him more involved recently in the central process and that will help greatly.&quot;

On October 24, 2019, James announced his retirement from the Red Sox, saying that he had &quot;fallen out of step with the organization&quot; and added that he hadn&#x27;t earned his paycheck with the Red Sox for the last couple of years. During his time with the team, Bill James received four World Series rings for the team&#x27;s 2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018 World Series titles.

== Other writing ==
James has written two true crime books, &quot;Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence&quot; (2011) and - together with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James - &quot;The Man from the Train&quot; (2017). The latter is an attempt to link scores of murders of entire families in the early 20th century United States to a single perpetrator. Those murders include the Villisca axe murders. The Jameses propose a solution to the murders based on the signature elements these killings share with each other.

James is a fan of the University of Kansas men&#x27;s basketball team and has written about basketball. He has created a formula for what he calls a &quot;safe lead&quot; in the sport.

== In culture ==
Michael Lewis, in his 2003 book &quot;&quot;, dedicates a chapter to James&#x27;s career and sabermetrics as background for his portrayal of Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics&#x27; unlikely success.

James was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2007.

James was profiled on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on March 30, 2008, in his role as a sabermetric pioneer and Red Sox advisor. In 2010, he was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.

James made a guest appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2010 episode &quot;MoneyBART&quot;. He claimed &quot;I&#x27;ve made baseball as fun as doing your taxes.&quot;

Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s planned film adaptation of &quot;&quot; would have featured an animated version of James as a &quot;host&quot;. This script was discarded when director Bennett Miller and writer Aaron Sorkin succeeded Soderbergh on the project. Ultimately, the 2011 film mentions James several times. His bio is briefly recapped, and Billy Beane is depicted telling John Henry that Henry&#x27;s hiring of James is the reason Beane is interested in the Red Sox general manager job.

==Controversies==
===Dowd Report controversy===
In his &quot;Baseball Book 1990&quot;, James heavily criticized the methodology of the Dowd Report, which was an investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti) on the gambling activities of Pete Rose. James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose&#x27;s gambling. (James&#x27;s attitude on the matter surprised many fans, especially after the writer had been deeply critical of Rose in the past, especially what James considered to be Rose&#x27;s selfish pursuit of Ty Cobb&#x27;s all-time record for base hits.)

James expanded his defense of Rose in his 2001 book &quot;The New Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, with a detailed explanation of why he found the case against Rose flimsy. James wrote &quot;I would characterize the evidence that Rose bet on baseball as...well, not quite non-existent. It is extremely weak.&quot; This countered the popular opinion that the case against Rose was a slam dunk, and several critics claimed that James misstated some of the evidence in his defense of Rose. Derek Zumsteg of Baseball Prospectus wrote an exhaustive review of the case James made and concluded: &quot;James&#x27; defense of Rose is filled with oversights, errors in judgment, failures in research, and is a great disservice to the many people who have looked to him for a balanced and fair take on this complicated and important issue.&quot;

In 2004, Rose admitted publicly that he had bet on baseball and confirmed the Dowd Report was correct. James remained steadfast, continuing to insist that the evidence available to Dowd at the time was insufficient to reach the conclusion that it did.

===Paterno controversy===
On November 4, 2011, Jerry Sandusky was indicted for committing sex crimes against young boys, which brought the Penn State child sex abuse scandal to national attention. On December 11, 2011, James published an article called &quot;The Trial of Penn State&quot;, depicting an imaginary trial in which Penn State defended itself against charges of &quot;acting rashly and irresponsibly in the matter of Joe Paterno, in such a manner that [they] defamed, libeled and slandered Paterno, unfairly demolishing his reputation.&quot;

On July 12, 2012, the Freeh report was released, charging Paterno and three other University officials with covering up reports of sexual assaults and enabling the attacker to prey on other children for more than a decade, often in Penn State facilities. Soon afterwards, during an interview on ESPN radio, James claimed that the Freeh report&#x27;s characterizations of Paterno as a powerful figure were wrong, and that it was not Paterno&#x27;s responsibility to report allegations of child molestation to the police. &quot;[Paterno] had very few allies. He was isolated and he was not nearly as powerful as people imagine him to have been.&quot; When asked if he knew anyone who had showered with a boy they were not related to, James said it was a common practice when he was growing up. &quot;That was actually quite common in the town I grew up in. That was quite common in America 40 years ago.&quot;

The July 2012 interview comments were widely criticized. Rob Neyer wrote in defense of James. James&#x27;s employer, the Boston Red Sox, issued a statement disavowing the comments James made and saying that he had been asked not to make further public comments on the matter.

===&quot;Replaceable players&quot; controversy===

On November 7, 2018, James participated in a Twitter conversation regarding comments made by agent Scott Boras about teams &quot;tanking&quot;. James wrote:If the players all retired tomorrow, we would replace them, the game would go on; in three years it would make no difference whatsoever. The players are NOT the game, any more than the beer vendors are.This was arguably consistent with thoughts James had publicly expressed prior to his affiliation with the Red Sox. In an article in &quot;The 1988 Bill James Baseball Abstract&quot;, he had written:This nation could support, without any detectable loss of player quality, at a very, very minimum, 200 major league teams.Nonetheless, in the context of James&#x27;s association with the Red Sox front office and baseball&#x27;s checkered labor history (including alleged collusion amongst the owners in the previous offseason to curb free agent salaries), the tweets were taken by many as inflammatory. Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark called James&#x27;s comments &quot;reckless and insulting&quot;. Other active or former players also objected. James told the &quot;New York Times&quot;:I don&#x27;t know that the idea that the game endures and we&#x27;re all just passing through it is inherently an offensive idea. But if I phrased it in an offensive way, that was not my intention.The Red Sox responded by issuing a statement saying:Bill James is a consultant to the Red Sox. He is not an employee, nor does he speak for the club. His comments on Twitter were inappropriate and do not reflect the opinions of the Red Sox front office or its ownership group. Our Championships would not have been possible without our incredibly talented players — they are the backbone of our franchise and our industry. To insinuate otherwise is absurd.

==Personal life==
James married Susan McCarthy in 1978. They have three children.

In January 2024, James announced that he had suffered a stroke, which impeded the use of his right hand.

<doc id="63493" wikidata="Q536900" url="?curid=63493" title="Ken Griffey Jr.">
<text>George Kenneth Griffey Jr. (born November 21, 1969), nicknamed &quot;Junior&quot; and &quot;the Kid&quot;, is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played 22 years in Major League Baseball (MLB). He spent most of his career with the Seattle Mariners and Cincinnati Reds, along with a short stint with the Chicago White Sox. The first overall pick in the 1987 draft and a 13-time All-Star, Griffey is one of the most prolific home run hitters in baseball history; his 630 home runs rank as the seventh-most in MLB history. Griffey was also an exceptional defender and won 10 Gold Glove Awards in center field. He is tied for the record of most consecutive games with a home run (eight, with Don Mattingly and Dale Long).

Griffey signed lucrative deals with companies of international prominence like Nike and Nintendo; his popularity reflected well upon MLB and is credited by some with helping restore its image after the 1994 labor dispute. Griffey is one of only 31 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four different calendar decades.

Following his playing career, Griffey joined the Mariners&#x27; front office as a special consultant. He was inducted into both the Mariners Hall of Fame and the Reds Hall of Fame. In 2016, Griffey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, receiving 99.32% of the vote, breaking pitcher Tom Seaver&#x27;s record of 98.84%, a record that had stood for 24 years. 

Griffey is the son of former MLB player Ken Griffey Sr. and the father of former football player Trey Griffey.

==Early life==
Griffey was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21, 1969. His family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, as his father, Ken Griffey Sr., made his MLB debut on August 25, 1973 for the Reds. Ken Jr. was only three years old at the time. Ken Jr. was in the clubhouse during his father&#x27;s back-to-back championships in the 1975 and 1976 World Series. When Griffey was a young child, Ken Sr. instilled in him the pride of a team accomplishment rather than the individual performance: &quot;My dad would have bopped me on the head when I was a kid if I came home bragging about what I did on the field. He only wanted to know what the team did.&quot; An incident during his father&#x27;s tenure with the New York Yankees, where Griffey Jr. was told to leave the dugout while sitting with his father, while a white player&#x27;s son was allowed to practice on the field, would lead to Griffey Jr. refusing to contemplate signing with the Yankees during his career.

He attended Archbishop Moeller High School in Cincinnati (the same high school as his future teammate Barry Larkin), where he was the U.S. high school baseball player of the year in 1987. Griffey hit .478 with 17 home runs in his two seasons of high school baseball. Griffey also played football as a wide receiver and received scholarship offers to play college football for such programs as Oklahoma and Michigan.

==Professional career==

===Draft and minor leagues===
The Seattle Mariners selected Griffey with the first overall selection of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft, held on June 2, 1987. He received a signing bonus of $160,000 from the Mariners. On June 11, 1987, Griffey joined the Bellingham Mariners of the Northwest League, a Low-A minor league. He made his professional debut on June 16, 1987. During the 54-game season he hit .313 with 14 home runs, 40 runs batted in, and 13 steals. &quot;Baseball America&quot; magazine named him the league&#x27;s number one major league prospect.
In 1988, Griffey joined the San Bernardino Spirit of the High-A California League. During his 58 games with the Spirit, Griffey batted .338, hit 11 home runs, drove in 42 runs, and stole 32 bases. Late in the season, Griffey was promoted to the Vermont Mariners of the Double-A Eastern League. He played the final 17 games with the club, hitting .279 with two home runs and 10 runs batted in.

===Seattle Mariners (1989–1999)===

In his first 11 seasons with Seattle (1989–1999), Griffey established himself as one of the most prolific and exciting players of the era, racking up 1,752 hits, 398 home runs, 1,152 runs batted in, and 167 stolen bases. He led the American League in home runs for four seasons (1994, 1997, 1998, and 1999), was voted the A.L. MVP in 1997, and maintained a .297 career batting average.

Griffey&#x27;s defense in center field was widely considered the standard of elite fielding during the decade, exemplified by his streak of 10 straight Gold Gloves from 1990 to 1999. His impressive range allowed frequent spectacular diving plays, and he often dazzled fans with over-the-shoulder basket catches and robbed opposing hitters of home runs by leaping up and pulling them back into the field of play. He was featured on the Wheaties cereal box and had his own signature sneaker line from Nike, Inc.
On April 3, 1989, in his very first MLB plate appearance, Griffey hit a line-drive double off Oakland Athletics pitcher Dave Stewart at the Oakland Coliseum. One week later in his first at-bat at the Kingdome, Griffey hit his first major league home run. Griffey was a frequent participant in the All-Star Game during the 1990s. He led his league multiple times in different hitting categories.

In 1990 and 1991, Griffey and his father became the first son and father to play on the same team at the same time. In his father&#x27;s first game as a Mariner, on August 31, 1990, the pair hit back-to-back singles in the first inning and both scored. On September 14, the pair hit back-to-back home runs in the top of the first off California Angels pitcher Kirk McCaskill, becoming the first father-son duo to hit back-to-back home runs. On September 21, Ken Griffey Jr. famously stole a fly ball off the bat of Sammy Sosa from his father, who was playing left field, for the third out of the inning. Then-twenty year old Griffey Jr. was subsequently grounded by his father in the dugout after the play for going inside the former&#x27;s previously established &quot;three square feet territory&quot; in left field for fly balls and had his car keys confiscated. The duo played a total of 51 games together before Griffey Sr. retired in June 1991.

At the MLB Home Run Derby in 1993, which was held at Oriole Park in Baltimore, Griffey hit the warehouse beyond the right-field wall on the fly and he is still the only player ever to do so. As with every home run that hits Eutaw Street, each feat is honored with a circular plaque, embedded horizontally onto the concourse&#x27;s walkway, in the exact spot where the ball landed. In 1994, he led the league in voting for All-Star Game selection. That season, which ended prematurely on August 12 due to the labor dispute, saw Griffey hit 30 home runs in the Mariners&#x27; first 65 games. He would go on to have four multi-home run games that year. Although his pace cooled somewhat in the final eight weeks of the season (he only hit 10 home runs in the Mariners&#x27; last 47 games), his 40 home runs by August 12 still put him two ahead of Chicago&#x27;s Frank Thomas and four ahead of Cleveland&#x27;s Albert Belle for the AL lead.

One of the most memorable moments of Griffey&#x27;s career with the Mariners came during the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees. After losing the first two games, the Mariners and Griffey were on the verge of elimination, but came back to win the next two games, setting up a decisive fifth game. In the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 5, with Griffey on first base, teammate Edgar Martínez hit a double. Griffey raced around the bases, slid into home with the winning run, and popped up into the waiting arms of the entire team. The 1995 AL Division Series kicked off a brief rivalry between the Yankees and Mariners. Griffey may have escalated it by saying that he would never play for the Yankees, because the Yankees allegedly treated his father, Ken Griffey Sr. badly. Also, when Griffey was a kid visiting his dad in the Yankee clubhouse, Yankee manager Billy Martin would, believing that children did not belong in the clubhouse, kick him out of there. Although the Mariners subsequently lost the ALCS to the Cleveland Indians (managed by later Mariners manager Mike Hargrove), that moment remains one of the most memorable in Mariners history, capping a season that &quot;saved baseball in Seattle&quot;, Seattle&#x27;s improbable late-season playoff run that year, spurred by Griffey&#x27;s return from injury, led to the construction of Safeco Field and the future security of a franchise rumored for years to be on the move. The play also inspired the title of the video game &quot;Ken Griffey Jr.&#x27;s Winning Run&quot; for the Super NES.
In 1997, Griffey led the Mariners to the AL West crown and captured the American League Most Valuable Player Award, hitting .304 with 56 home runs and 147 runs batted in during 157 games. The next season, 1998, was a season which was followed closely by the national media as both Griffey and Mark McGwire entered the summer ahead of the pace of Roger Maris&#x27; home run record of 61. Despite Griffey falling short, Major League Baseball put forth an effort to draw a new set of young fans and regain those disenchanted by the 1994 strike focused on McGwire, Sosa, and Griffey&#x27;s pursuit of Maris&#x27; record. Griffey, however, fell out of the spotlight due to some nagging injuries and was surpassed by Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, who finished with 66 home runs, himself falling short of McGwire&#x27;s then record 70. Despite falling out of the record chase, Griffey nearly duplicated his 1997 statistics, finishing with a .284 average, 56 home runs and 146 runs batted in during 161 games. On April 15, 1997, Griffey wore the number 42, which led to an MLB tradition started in 1999 known as Jackie Robinson Day.

In 1999, he ranked 93rd on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. This list was compiled during the 1998 season, counting only statistics through 1997. At age 29 (going on 30), he was the youngest player on the list. That same year, Griffey was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. However, when &quot;TSN&quot; updated their list for a new book in 2005, despite having surpassed 400 and 500 home runs, Griffey remained at Number 93.

While playing with Seattle, Griffey was a 10-time American League Gold Glove winner, the 1992 All-Star Game MVP, 1997 AL MVP, 1998 ESPY co-winner for Male Athlete of the Year, 1999 &quot;Players Choice Awards&quot; Player of the Decade (by the players), and was named to the All-Century team in 1999.

====Departure from Seattle (1999–2000)====
Griffey formerly lived in the same neighborhood in Orlando as golfer Payne Stewart. After Stewart&#x27;s death in a plane crash on October 25, 1999, Griffey started expressing a desire to live closer to his relatives in his hometown of Cincinnati. Not only did Griffey want to live closer, but he wanted to be able to raise his kids, Trey and Taryn (Tevin was not born at the time). On February 10, 2000, Griffey was traded to the Reds for pitcher Brett Tomko, outfielder Mike Cameron, and minor leaguers Antonio Perez and Jake Meyer. Griffey signed a nine-year, $112.5 million contract with the Reds after the trade was completed, with a club option for a 10th. Earlier that offseason, Griffey vetoed a trade to the New York Mets for Roger Cedeño, Octavio Dotel, and a relief pitcher variously reported as Dennis Cook or Armando Benítez. Griffey&#x27;s agent, Brian Goldberg, said afterward that Griffey would only accept a trade to the Reds and &quot;[i]f he can&#x27;t go to Cincinnati, then he&#x27;s going back to Seattle for the final year of his contract.&quot;

===Cincinnati Reds (2000–2008)===
====2000–2004====

In 2000, Griffey changed his number from 24 to 30, the number his father wore while playing in both Cincinnati and Seattle; the number 24 was already retired in honor of Tony Pérez. The 2000 season began what has generally been seen by the media as a decline in Griffey&#x27;s superstar status. Although his statistics during this season were respectable, they were far below his previous level of play: in 145 games, Griffey hit .271 with 40 home runs and 118 runs batted in, but his .942 on-base plus slugging was his lowest mark in five years. From 2001 through 2004, Griffey was plagued by a string of injuries, including season-ending injuries in 2002, 2003, and 2004. The cumulative effects of the injuries lowered his bat speed, resulting in less power and fewer home runs (he slugged only .426 before succumbing to injury in 2002, his lowest output in seven years). Injuries forced Griffey to miss 260 out of 486 games from 2002 through 2004, diminishing both his skills and his star reputation.

In 2004, Griffey avoided major injury during the first half of the season, and on June 20 became the 20th player to hit 500 career home runs. His 500th home run came on Father&#x27;s Day in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium, with his father in the stands; the homer tied Griffey with his father in career hits with 2,143. However, the injury bug bit again just before the All-Star break; he suffered a partial hamstring tear, knocking him out of the All-Star Game and putting him on the disabled list yet again.

Griffey finished the 2004 season on the disabled list after suffering a rupture of his right hamstring in San Francisco. The play in question occurred at AT&amp;T Park in a game against the San Francisco Giants. Griffey was starting in right field for the first time in his 16-year Major League career when he raced toward the gap to try to cut off a ball before it got to the wall. He slid as he got to the ball, but in the process hyper-extended his right leg, tearing the hamstring completely off the bone. He later came out of the game, complaining of &quot;tightness&quot; in the hamstring exacerbated by chilly conditions in San Francisco. However, there was far more to it than anyone realized at the time.

Shortly after this injury, the Reds&#x27; team physician, Timothy Kremchek, devised an experimental surgery dubbed &quot;The Junior Operation&quot; that would use three titanium screws to reattach Griffey&#x27;s hamstring. For several weeks, Griffey&#x27;s right leg was in a sling that kept it at a 90-degree angle, and he was not able to move the leg until late October. After an intense rehabilitation period, he returned for the 2005 season. In April, he hit .244 with one homer (on April 30) and nine runs batted in.

====2005–2006====

Starting May 1, the 2005 season saw the resurgence of a healthy Griffey. His 35 home runs were his highest since his first year with the Reds as Griffey slowly moved up the career home run list. He ended the season tied with Mickey Mantle, after having passed Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, Willie McCovey, Ernie Banks, Eddie Mathews, Mel Ott, and Eddie Murray.

Early in September, he strained a tendon in his left foot (an injury unrelated to his past hamstring and calf problems), and was listed as day-to-day for several weeks. On September 22, with the Reds out of playoff contention, Griffey decided to sit out for the rest of the season so he could immediately have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and a separate operation to repair scars from his 2004 hamstring operation. Still, his 128 games in 2005 were the most he had played since 2000. Griffey&#x27;s resurgence was recognized when he was named National League Comeback Player of the Year. He played in the World Baseball Classic for the American team that off-season with his father as a coach. Griffey batted .524, but the USA failed to reach the semifinals.

At the start of the 2006 season, Griffey changed his number from 30 to 3 to honor his three children. During the second game of the 2006 regular season, Griffey hit home run #537, surpassing Mickey Mantle for 12th on the all-time list. He returned on May 11 from a knee injury suffered April 12, and hit a walk-off three-run home run in the bottom of the 11th inning against the Washington Nationals. On June 5, Griffey tied Fred McGriff&#x27;s record by hitting a home run in his 43rd different ballpark, at the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; Busch Stadium. On June 19, Griffey hit career home run #548 against the Mets, tying him with Mike Schmidt, and then six days later passed Schmidt with #549 against the Cleveland Indians. On June 27, he hit his 550th career home run against the Kansas City Royals. On September 25, 2006, Griffey hit his 27th home run of the season against Chicago Cubs relief pitcher Scott Eyre to tie Reggie Jackson for tenth on the all-time home run list.

Griffey&#x27;s injuries continued in the 2006 off-season. While on holiday in the Bahamas with his family, he broke his wrist. Griffey said his hand felt fine and he expected to be ready to go for 2007 spring training.

====2007====

At the beginning of the 2007 Major League Baseball season, Ryan Freel took over center field for the Reds, and Griffey Jr. was moved to right field. Reds manager Jerry Narron said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to do everything I can do to put our best club out there. My feeling is that with Ryan Freel out there, it gives us strong defense up the middle.&quot;

On May 10, 2007, Griffey hit his sixth home run of the season and the 569th of his career, tying Rafael Palmeiro for ninth place on the career home runs list. He passed Palmeiro on May 13 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Griffey tied Harmon Killebrew for eighth on the all-time list hitting his 573rd career home run on May 22. He then surpassed him on May 25 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

On June 22, 2007, Griffey made his first return to Seattle after his trade to the Reds. Before the game, the Mariners honored him with a 15-minute presentation which included a highlight reel of his playing career with the Mariners, a presentation of a &quot;The House that Griffey Built&quot; memorial by Mariners hall-of-famers and former teammates Jay Buhner and Edgar Martínez, and a four-minute standing ovation from the sold-out crowd. Griffey did not expect such a welcome or a turnout by fans when he came back, and a short but emotional speech was given by Griffey afterwards. Many of the fans in attendance made signs professing their gratitude and adoration toward him with quotes such as: &quot;The House that Griffey Built&quot;, &quot;Seattle Junior&quot;, and &quot;Griffey we miss you.&quot; Griffey went 1-for-5 in the game. On June 24, Griffey hit his 583rd and 584th career home runs, tying and passing Mark McGwire for seventh place on the all-time career home run list.

Following the Cincinnati Reds versus Seattle Mariners series from June 22–24, 2007, a fan movement emerged petitioning Mariners&#x27; management to bring Griffey back. Over 1,900 signatures were collected on a fan vid-blog/petition.

Griffey received the most votes of any player in the National League for the 2007 All-Star balloting, and in the July 10 game, he went on to drive in two runs for the National League. On July 16, 2007, Griffey hit his 587th home run to pass Frank Robinson for sixth place on the all-time home run list. On July 18, 2007, Griffey hit his 2,500th hit, a first-inning single off Atlanta Braves starting pitcher John Smoltz.

On September 19, 2007, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Griffey fielded a Derrek Lee single in right field, then suddenly went down in pain. The injury, first thought to be a lower abdominal strain, was later revealed to be a season-ending groin strain. This marked one of many seasons in Cincinnati in which Griffey had to end the year on the disabled list. Griffey ended the 2007 season with 593 career home runs.

On August 22, 2007, Griffey was selected as an all-time Rawlings Gold Glove winner, on a list of nine players considered the greatest defensive players in the last 50 years. He finished the season with 78 runs, 146 hits, 24 doubles, one triple, 30 home runs, 93 runs batted in, and a .277 batting average in 144 games.

====2008====
On April 4, 2008, Griffey passed Reggie Jackson for 16th on the all-time list after driving in his 1,702nd run. On June 9, Griffey hit his 600th home run on a 3–1 pitch from Mark Hendrickson of the Florida Marlins in the first inning at Land Shark Stadium in Miami. Fans of both teams gave him a standing ovation.

Despite being ranked second in the National League All-Star voting for outfielders for most of the first half of the season, Griffey finished fourth with 2,907,746 ballots, 87,000 votes behind Kosuke Fukudome. He was not selected to the All-Star Game as a reserve. At the All-Star Break, Griffey was batting .239 with 12 home runs and 42 runs batted in. &quot;I always have a backup plan... If you can&#x27;t hit a tough lefty, bunt. If you can&#x27;t hit a tough righty, bunt. If you can&#x27;t go to the All-Star Game, go to the Bahamas,&quot; Griffey said.

On July 30, Griffey hit his 608th career home run in his last game for the Reds.

Griffey was criticized by some for his effort during his stint with the Reds. Gregg Doyel had this to say of the years Griffey was with the Reds in comparison to the 2010 Reds team: &quot;It&#x27;s a different Reds team than the older, beer-bellied softball teams of recent years. Those Reds were Ken Griffey and Adam Dunn lounging on the clubhouse&#x27;s leather couches, hitting home runs, misplaying balls in the outfield, and thinking they had it all figured out, when all they knew how to do was lose.&quot;

===Chicago White Sox (2008)===

On July 31, 2008, at the MLB trade deadline, Griffey was traded to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Nick Masset and infielder Danny Richar, ending his nine-year tenure in Cincinnati. In his first game with the White Sox, he went 2-for-3 with 2 runs batted in, a walk, and a run.

On August 20, 2008, Griffey hit his first home run as a member of the White Sox, off the Mariners&#x27; R. A. Dickey, which moved him into a tie with former outfielder Sammy Sosa for fifth place in career home runs. He surpassed Sosa on September 23, with one off Minnesota&#x27;s Matt Guerrier.

Griffey&#x27;s signature moment with the White Sox came on September 30, the last game of the 2008 season; an extra 163rd game between the White Sox and Minnesota Twins to break the tie atop the AL Central. In the fifth inning of the scoreless game, the Twins threatened with Michael Cuddyer on third and one out. Twins third baseman Brendan Harris flied out softly to Griffey in center field, who threw a strike to White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski who tagged out Cuddyer at home in a home plate collision to complete the double play and end the threat. The White Sox went on to beat the Twins, 1–0, to advance to the 2008 American League Division Series, where they fell to the Tampa Bay Rays.

On October 30, 2008, the White Sox declined a $16 million option on Griffey, making him a free agent for the first time in his career. Griffey would instead receive a buyout for $4 million, split between the Reds and White Sox. Griffey hit .249 with 18 home runs and 71 runs batted in during 143 games with the Reds and White Sox in 2008. When the 2008 season ended he said he wouldn&#x27;t retire, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve got things to do.&quot;

===Return to Mariners (2009–2010)===

As a free agent, Griffey was courted by the Mariners and the Atlanta Braves. The national media was dubious about Griffey&#x27;s ability to contribute meaningfully, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noting &quot;... the Mariners are not about to sign Griffey for baseball reasons; they&#x27;re bringing him back to Seattle to sell tickets.&quot; Griffey ultimately accepted a contract offer from the Mariners on February 18, 2009, after &quot;agonizing&quot; over the decision. Griffey indicated he was motivated by sentimental reasons toward Seattle, where he received an overwhelmingly positive reception when he last played there as a Cincinnati Red in June 2007, but was inclined towards the Braves for its proximity to his home in Orlando, Florida, and his desire to be with his family during the season. Apparently, Griffey was very close to signing with the Braves; however, a premature report emerged from &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; that an Atlanta deal was done and a conversation with Willie Mays and his own 13-year-old daughter played a factor in his choice. Griffey once again sported #24 with the Mariners; the team had not issued the number to any player or coach in the nine years between his two stints in Seattle.

Griffey went 1-for-3 with a home run in his regular-season debut on April against the Minnesota Twins. The home run was Griffey&#x27;s eighth Opening Day home run; as of 2013, he is tied with Frank Robinson and Adam Dunn for first place in this category. On April 15, 2009, Griffey hit his 400th home run as a Mariner (613th of career), off Los Angeles Angels pitcher Jered Weaver, becoming the first MLB player to hit 400 home runs with one club (Mariners) and 200 home runs with another (Reds). AP stated, &quot;Griffey returned to the Mariners in 2009 and almost single-handedly transformed what had been a fractured, bickering clubhouse with his leadership, energy and constant pranks.&quot;

On June 23, 2009, at Safeco Field, Griffey hit the 5,000th home run in franchise history, off San Diego Padres pitcher Chad Gaudin. This was Griffey&#x27;s 619th career home run. On July 1, Griffey hit career home run 621 at the new Yankee Stadium, off Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte in the sixth inning. It marked the 44th different ballpark in which he had hit a home run. On August 12, 2009, against his former team, the Chicago White Sox, he hit a run-scoring single in the bottom of the 14th inning to win the game, 1–0, for the Mariners.

Griffey returned to the Mariners for the 2010 campaign with a similar one-year contract to that of 2009, but struggled offensively over the first two months while posting a .184 batting average. On April 27, Griffey passed Andre Dawson for 45th on the career hit list. On May 20, 2010, in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Griffey hit a run-scoring single off Blue Jays&#x27; closer Kevin Gregg to win the game, 4–3, for the Mariners. After starting the ninth inning trailing 3–1, the Mariners rallied in the bottom of the ninth to load the bases on two singles and a walk, then tied the game via a walk and a sacrifice fly. The walk-off single was the final hit and run batted in of Griffey&#x27;s Major League Baseball career, and moved him past Rafael Palmeiro to 14th on the all-time runs batted in list.

===Retirement===
In May 2010, Mariners&#x27; manager Don Wakamatsu made the decision to significantly limit Griffey&#x27;s play due to his ongoing poor performance. On May 10, 2010, beat writer Larry Larue reported that Wakamatsu had not used Griffey in a pinch-hitting situation the prior week, with two players stating that Griffey had been asleep. National media quickly covered the incident, dubbed &quot;Napgate&quot;. In the ensuing days, teammate Mike Sweeney said he challenged anyone who said Griffey was asleep &quot;to stand up and fight me&quot; with Wakamatsu denying Griffey had been asleep; however, Griffey did not deny it. Griffey&#x27;s agent stated Larue&#x27;s initial report had been posted in error and that Larue had asked his employer to remove it, both of which they refuted. In the aftermath of his report, Larue was boycotted by players.

On June 2, 2010, with the clubhouse still in turmoil, Griffey left the Mariners after the second game of a four-game series with the Minnesota Twins, leaving in the middle of the night for a cross-country drive to his home in Florida. He released a statement through the Seattle Mariners organization announcing his retirement effective immediately. Mariners president Chuck Armstrong was only made aware of this by Griffey&#x27;s agent a few hours before gametime the next day; Griffey then called from the road to confirm it. His retirement was announced at Safeco Field before the Mariners played the Twins. In an interview on March 17, 2011, Griffey stated he had retired to avoid being a distraction for the team.

==Post-playing career==
On February 17, 2011, Griffey was hired by the Mariners as a special consultant. He is involved with the Mariners at spring training and the regular season, along with visiting most of the Mariners minor-league affiliates.
On January 22, 2013, the Mariners announced Griffey would be the seventh person inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame. Griffey joined Alvin Davis (1997), Dave Niehaus (2000), Jay Buhner (2004), Edgar Martínez (2007), Randy Johnson (2012) and Dan Wilson (2012). He was formally inducted on August 10, 2013. Jamie Moyer was selected in 2015.

A campaign had been formed to rename a section of First Avenue South, which runs adjacent to T-Mobile Park, to Ken Griffey Jr. Drive just after his announcement to retire from baseball. Later, the campaign changed direction after the death of Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus in November 2010 to Dave Niehaus Way South.

Writer Bill Simmons pointed out the prevalent belief that Griffey was the best home run hitter of the 1990s who everyone was convinced never used performance enhancing drugs. Therefore, Simmons stated Griffey was the one player who would be the most devastating to &quot;an entire generation of American men&quot; should he ever be linked to steroids.

On August 9, 2014, Griffey was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. Griffey returned to Cincinnati for the weekend activities and choked up during his speech when he mentioned wearing the same uniform as his dad. Second baseman Ron Oester, outfielder Dave Parker, and first baseman Jake Beckley joined Griffey in the Class of 2014.

In 2018, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; named Griffey as the most important athlete in Seattle sports history.

On October 25, 2021, Griffey joined the Mariners ownership group, becoming the first former player to hold partnership interest in the Mariners.

===Baseball Hall of Fame election===

On January 6, 2016, Griffey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 99.32 percent of the vote, breaking the record previously held by Tom Seaver&#x27;s 98.84 percent in 1992. A flag bearing Griffey&#x27;s number 24 was flown from the Space Needle following the announcement. Griffey is one of four Baseball Hall of Fame inductees who have been chosen first overall in an MLB draft. The other three are Chipper Jones, who was inducted in 2018, Harold Baines, who was inducted by the Veterans Committee in 2019, and Joe Mauer, who was inducted in 2024.

To coincide with his Hall of Fame election, the Mariners announced on January 8, 2016, that they would retire his jersey number 24. The retirement took effect with the start of the 2016 MLB season, with the formal ceremony taking place prior to the Mariners&#x27; August 6, 2016 game. The jersey retirement includes the number 24 also being taken out of circulation of all of the Mariners minor league affiliates.

The Mariners also honored Griffey in a unique fashion in the 2016 MLB draft, selecting his son Trey in the 24th round (matching his jersey number), even though Trey, at the time a wide receiver at the University of Arizona, had not played baseball since his preteen years.

On July 29, 2021, Griffey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Board of Directors.

As of 2021, Griffey is also working as a senior adviser to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.

==Philanthropy==
In 2008, Griffey released a series of charity wines to support The Ken Griffey Jr. Family Foundation, a fund that supports several causes, including the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and several children&#x27;s hospitals across the United States. He is also an honorary co-chairman of the AOPA Foundation&#x27;s Hat in the Ring Society, a charitable organization that promotes aviation safety and education.

==Film and television==
==Personal life==
In April 2007, Griffey was diagnosed with pleurisy, an inflammation of the lining of the cavity surrounding the lungs which can cause painful respiration and other symptoms.

Griffey and his wife Melissa have three children: Ken Griffey III (Trey), daughter Taryn Kennedy, and son Tevin Kendall. Trey was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) (2017–2019). Taryn attended the University of Arizona and played for the women&#x27;s basketball team.

The Griffey family resides in Windermere, Florida, where Ken Griffey Sr. is also a resident.

Griffey was named an American Public Diplomacy Envoy by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on November 18, 2008.

Griffey has a private pilot certificate and owns a Cirrus SR22.

Since 2015, Griffey has worked as a sports photographer, and has been credentialed to shoot 
MLB, MLS, NFL, and IndyCar events.

The video game &quot;MLB The Show 17&quot; includes Griffey as the cover athlete for the American version of the game.

The Griffey family joined as a minority owner in the Seattle Sounders FC on November 17, 2020.

On May 26, 2024, Griffey drove the pace car for the 2024 Indianapolis 500.

===Suicide attempt===
In January 1988, Griffey attempted suicide by swallowing 277 aspirin pills but wound up in intensive care at Providence Hospital in Mount Airy, Ohio. Griffey Jr. cited arguments with his father, depression, and anger as reasons for his attempted suicide. On his failed attempt, Griffey Jr. stated, &quot;It seemed like everyone was yelling at me in baseball, then I came home and everyone was yelling at me there. I got depressed. I got angry. I didn&#x27;t want to live.&quot; He stated that he had also previously contemplated taking his own life, but he had not acted on it until this incident. After Griffey swallowed the aspirin, his girlfriend&#x27;s mother drove him to the hospital. While in intensive care, he ripped the IV from his arm in order to stop an argument between him and his father. Both Griffey Jr. and his father stated that the incident changed their relationship, and since then, there has been better understanding for both of them.

<text>The Boston Post Road was a system of mail-delivery routes between New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, that evolved into one of the first major highways in the United States.

The three major alignments were the Lower Post Road (now U.S. Route 1 (US 1) along the shore via Providence, Rhode Island), the Upper Post Road (now US 5 and US 20 from New Haven, Connecticut, by way of Springfield, Massachusetts), and the Middle Post Road (which diverged from the Upper Road in Hartford, Connecticut, and ran northeastward to Boston via Pomfret, Connecticut).

In some towns, the area near the Boston Post Road has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, since it was often the first road in the area, and some buildings of historical significance were built along it. The Boston Post Road Historic District, including part of the road in Rye, New York, has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The Post Road is also famous for milestones that date from the 18th century, many of which survive to this day. In parts of Connecticut (generally east of Hartford), it is also known as Route 6.

==History==
The Upper Post Road was originally called the Pequot Path and had been in use by Native Americans long before Europeans arrived. Some of these important native trails were in many places as narrow as two feet.

What is now called the Old Connecticut Path and the Bay Path were used by John Winthrop the Younger to travel from Boston to Springfield in November 1645, and these form much of the basis for the Upper Post Road.

The colonists first used this trail to deliver the mail using post riders. The first ride to lay out the Upper Post Road started on January 1, 1673. Later, the newly blazed trail was widened and smoothed to the point where horse-drawn wagons or stagecoaches could use the road. The country&#x27;s first successful long-distance stagecoach service was launched by Levi Pease along the upper road in October 1783.

During the 19th century, turnpike companies took over and improved pieces of the road. Large sections of the various routes are still called the &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; and &quot;Boston Post Road&quot;. Much of the Post Road is now U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 5, and U.S. Route 20.

Mileposts were measured from the intersection of Broadway and Wall Street in New York (one block west of Federal Hall) and from the old Boston city-line on Washington Street, near the present-day Massachusetts Turnpike.

The Metropolitan Railroad Company was chartered in 1853 to run streetcars down the stretch of the road on Washington Street in Roxbury, which is now served by the MBTA Silver Line. The Upper and Lower Boston Post Roads were designated U.S. Routes 1 and 20 in 1925 (though Route 20 has since been substantially modified).

==New York==
===Manhattan===
Much of the route in Manhattan, where it was known as the Eastern Post Road, was abandoned between 1839 and 1844, when the current street grid was laid out as part of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan that had been originally advanced in 1811. The following sections of the road still exist:
* Broadway – Park Row – Bowery – Fourth Avenue – Broadway from Wall Street (the southern end of the Post Road) to Madison Square Park
* There is a large gap in midtown Manhattan before Post Road resumes its course north of Central Park
* St. Nicholas Avenue-Broadway: St. Nicholas Avenue from 110th Street (with a realignment near 145th Street), switching to Broadway at 169th Street and continuing to 228th Street
* 228th Street-Kingsbridge Avenue from Broadway to the old Kings Bridge over the old Harlem River bed. (The course of the Harlem River was altered in 1895.)

These milestones were once present in Manhattan:
* 1 – the west side of Bowery near Rivington Street
* 2 – southwest corner of Astor Place and Fourth Avenue
* 3 – Madison Avenue and 26th Street
* 4 – east side of Third Avenue, halfway between 45th Street and 46th Street
* 5 – west side of Second Avenue at 62nd Street
* 6 – northwest corner of Third Avenue and 81st Street
* 7 – in Central Park, west of Fifth Avenue, between 97th Street and 98th Street
* 8 – St. Nicholas Avenue, west side, between 115th Street and 116th Street
* 9 – St. Nicholas Avenue, west side, opposite north line of 133rd Street
* 10 – southwest corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and 152nd Street
* 11 – Broadway, west side, near 170th Street or 171st Street ~ Now at Roger Morris Park next to the Morris-Jumel Manse 40°50&#x27;04.7&quot;N 73°56&#x27;18.5&quot;W
* 12 – Broadway, west side, at or near 189th Street ~ Now at the Broadway entrance to Isham Park 40°52&#x27;06.4&quot;N+73°55&#x27;08.9&quot;W
* 13 – east side of Broadway between Academy Street and 204th Street
* 14 – Broadway, west side, between 225th Street and 228th Street

===The Bronx===

In southwestern Westchester County, now the Bronx, the Boston Post Road came off the Kings Bridge and quickly turned east, with the Albany Post Road continuing north to Albany, New York. It passed over the Bronx River on the Williams Bridge, and left The Bronx on Bussing Avenue, becoming Kingsbridge Road in Westchester County. In more detail, it used the following modern roads:

* Kingsbridge Avenue – 230th Street – Broadway – 231st Street
** Albany Post Road continued north on Albany Crescent
* Albany Crescent – Kingsbridge Terrace – Heath Avenue
* gap across Jerome Park Reservoir
* Van Cortlandt Avenue
* gap at Williamsbridge Reservoir
* Reservoir Place – Gun Hill Road – White Plains Road (southbound lanes)
* gap from near 217th Street to near 231st Street
* Bussing Avenue
* gap from Grace Avenue to De Reimer Avenue
* Bussing Place – Bussing Avenue

===Westchester County===
* Pelham Manor
* New Rochelle
* Larchmont
* Mamaroneck
* Rye
* Port Chester

The Boston Post Road entered what is now Westchester County on Kingsbridge Road, and turned north on Third Avenue-Columbus Avenue (Route 22), forking off onto Colonial Place. It continued across Sandford Boulevard (Sixth Street) where there is no longer a road, and curved east and southeast around the hill, hitting Sandford Boulevard-Colonial Avenue at the Hutchinson River Parkway interchange. It then continued east on Colonial Avenue-Kings Highway, merging with U.S. Route 1. From there to the Connecticut border, the Post Road used US 1, except for several places, where Post Road used the following roads:
* The southbound side of US 1-Huguenot Street through downtown New Rochelle.
* Old Boston Post Road north of downtown New Rochelle.
* Old Post Road-Orienta Avenue south of downtown Mamaroneck.
* Mamaroneck Avenue-Prospect Avenue-Tompkins Avenue north of downtown Mamaroneck.
* Old Post Road at Playland Parkway in Rye.

==Upper Post Road==
The Upper Post Road was the most traveled of the three routes, being the furthest from the shore and thus having the fewest and shortest river crossings. It was also considered to have the best taverns, which contributed to its popularity. The Upper Post Road roughly corresponds to the alignment of U.S. Route 5 from New Haven, Connecticut, to Hartford; Connecticut Route 159 from Hartford to Springfield, Massachusetts; U.S. Route 20 from Springfield to Warren, Massachusetts (via Route 67); Massachusetts Route 9 from Warren to Worcester; an unnumbered road (Lincoln Street in Worcester, Main Street in Shrewsbury, and West Main Street in Northborough) to Northborough; and U.S. Route 20 from Northborough to Boston. A series of historic milestones erected in the 18th century survive along its route from Springfield to Boston.

===Connecticut===

===Massachusetts===
==Lower Post Road==
The Lower Post Road hugged the shoreline of Long Island Sound all the way to Rhode Island and then turned north through Providence to Boston. This is now the best-known of the routes. The Lower Post Road roughly corresponds to the original alignment of U.S. Route 1 in eastern Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.

===Rhode Island===

===Massachusetts===
In Massachusetts, the Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike was established in 1803 as a straighter route between Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and Roxbury, Massachusetts, mostly west of the Post Road. It is known as Washington Street in many of the towns it passes through. Due to its avoidance of built-up areas, the southern half of this road was little-used. In addition, another well-used route passed west of this turnpike along current Route 1A.

;South Attleboro
The Post Road entered Massachusetts at the town of Attleboro&#x27;s Newport Avenue (Route 1A) through the settlement of South Attleboro. It continued northeast on Newport Avenue along Route 123, splitting to the north (staying with Newport Avenue) to cross into North Attleborough.

;North Attleborough
South of North Attleborough center, the old road is known as Old Post Road. The old road crossed the turnpike (now US 1) just south of the intersection with Route 120, forming a small curve before merging with the turnpike north of the intersection. This curved alignment is now gone, so traffic must use US 1. Additionally, US 1 leaves the turnpike at the Route 120 intersection to bypass North Attleborough center on East Washington Street.

The Lower Post Road passed through North Attleborough Center on Washington Street, later used as part of the turnpike. Another short curved alignment still exists to the west of Washington Street north of the center, now called &quot;Park Street&quot;. Just north of this, the route crosses the Ten Mile River and then enters a complicated five-way intersection with US 1 and Route 1A. US 1 straight ahead is the old turnpike, and US 1 to the right was built in the 1930s. The Post Road went to the right onto Elmwood Street. The fork to the left onto Route 1A through Plainville center was an alternate route to Boston.

Elmwood Street enters the town of Plainville, where it becomes Messenger Street. The road merges with Route 106 before crossing Route 152 at Wilkins Four Corners and entering Foxborough.

;Sharon
There is a road passing from the town of Sharon into East Walpole which is known as Old Post Road, which continues north as Pleasant Street into Norwood. 

;East Walpole (part of Walpole)

;Norwood
In Norwood, the oldest route of the Post Road followed Neponset Street south until the intersection with Pleasant Street. The newer route followed Washington Street through the center of Norwood, south towards Walpole.

;Islington (part of Westwood)
The Post Road turned from East Street onto Washington Street, heading south towards Norwood.

;Dedham
In Dedham, the road followed modern-day Lower East Street north to Boston. Here the Post Road splits, with the oldest route (prior to 1704) following East Street in an arc around the old marshes until it meets Washington Street (Route 1A) south of the Dedham village center.

The new road (in use by 1744) followed High Street to Court Street, and continued south along Highland Street and Elm Street, rejoining East Street south of Interstate 95.

;Roxbury
In Roxbury, the road turned down Roxbury Street and followed modern-day Centre Street around the edge of Fort Hill, crossing Stony Brook at a bridge in the location of the modern-day Jackson Square MBTA station. The road continued following Centre Street southwards through modern-day Hyde Square and Jamaica Plain, and southwards to Dedham.

;Boston
In the colonial city, the road began at the Old State House, the government center of the 18th-century city. Once called Cornhill, Orange, and Newbury Street, it&#x27;s now modern-day Washington Street, running southwards off the Boston Neck towards the village of Roxbury.

==Middle Post Road==
The Middle Post Road was the shortest, fastest, and youngest portion of the route. From Hartford, it ran into the Eastern Upper Highlands, an area with large native Indian populations. During King Philip&#x27;s War of 1675, travel in these areas was often dangerous for settlers. It was not until the end of the war and establishment of the Colonial post system that the area began to become populated, and the middle post road was established as the fastest route. This area of the state continues to remain underpopulated in contrast to other portions of Connecticut, and accordingly, portions of the original post road have been preserved due to various circumstances. It split from the Upper Post Road in Hartford, and initially ran roughly along current U.S. Route 44 through Bolton Notch and towards Mansfield Four Corners. From Mansfield, it went through Ashford, Pomfret, and headed into Massachusetts via the town of Thompson, along Thompson Road. In Massachusetts, the Middle Post Road runs along sections of modern Route 16 to Mendon, then through Bellingham, and then via Route 109 from Medway to Dedham where it meets with the Lower Post Road (old U.S. Route 1) heading into Boston.

===Connecticut===
;Hartford
Starting at the Old State House, the road crossed the Connecticut River over the area that is now occupied by the Founders Bridge, initially by ferry and later by bridge. It is notable that until 1783, Hartford&#x27;s eastern boundaries included present-day East Hartford and Manchester.

;East Hartford
Although the road crossed via the route of the Founders Bridge from Hartford, this area was later developed into an enormous highway interchange, and thus much of the historic road was destroyed. In the early years of Connecticut&#x27;s history, East Hartford was privately owned. What remains of the route is the path of Interstate 84 / Route 6, which connects to Manchester&#x27;s Middle Turnpike East.

;Manchester
Since Manchester was a part of Hartford until 1783, the area was made up of settlements and present-day boroughs. The post road can be traced along present-day Middle Turnpike East through central Manchester. It later passed through Manchester Green, where the post road became reconnected with Route 6, and, for the first time, U.S. Route 44. Just before leaving Manchester and entering Bolton, the post road breaks off Route 44 onto Middle Turnpike East (the portion of Route 44 between Manchester and Bolton is known as &quot;New Bolton Road&quot;)

;Bolton
Bolton serves a unique role in the post road, as it was the border between the flat and tranquil Connecticut River Valley, and the hilly and turbulent Eastern Upper Highlands. Entering Bolton on Middle Turnpike East, the traveler encountered a fork and could choose to head southeast on Bolton Center Street (later Center Street) to the settlement of Bolton, or stay on Middle Turnpike East to reconnect with Route 44 and head east on the original Mohegan Indian Trail through Bolton Notch, a natural depression in the ridge that dramatically sped up transit and served as a demarcation between the two geologic landscapes. Within the Bolton settlement was White&#x27;s Tavern, notable for having housed the staff of General Rochambeau, whose unit camped in the settlement during the revolutionary war. To exit Bolton, one heads north on Notch Road until reaching Route 44, just outside Bolton Notch. Route 44 then connects to Coventry.

;Coventry
Between Bolton and Mansfield, the road passed through the borough of North Coventry, entirely along present-day U.S. Route 44, known locally as the Boston Turnpike. Along the Willimantic River (and border of Mansfield) stands the Brigham Tavern, which holds the distinction of having housed George Washington around the period of the Revolutionary War. This plaque can be seen in front of the Brigham Tavern; it is currently a private residence.

;Mansfield
Like Coventry, the post road follows the path of present-day U.S. Route 44. After crossing the Willimantic River from Coventry, the road crosses through Mansfield Four Corners, and towards Ashford.

;Ashford
The road connects on Route 44 from Mansfield, and runs directly through the borough of Ashford. It stops, however, at Phoenixville, which then heads north towards Eastford on Route 198. Before reaching Eastford, however, it takes a right onto Route 244 (&quot;Brayman Hollow Road&quot;) which headed directly to Pomfret.

;Pomfret
At the center of Pomfret, Route 244 headed east turns into U.S. Route 44. The post road turns left shortly after the intersection with Route 169 onto Allen Road which quickly merges into Freedley Road. The road then heads northeast into Woodstock.

;Woodstock
The post road briefly passes through the Harrisville section of town on Tripp Road before entering Putnam.

;Putnam
Soon after entering Putnam, the road crosses over Route 171 onto West Thompson Road headed into Thompson.

;Thompson
The post road soon follows over West Thompson Dam. The road once passed through the village of West Thompson, which was flooded purposely to control the Quinebaug River. The original post road can be seen from the Dam when water levels in West Thompson Lake are low enough. Once over the Dam the road turns into Route 193 and travels through historic Thompson Hill. Continuing northeast, the road bears right at a fork onto East Thompson Road and follows all the way to the Massachusetts state line.

===Massachusetts===
;Douglas
Crosses the Massachusetts state line into the town of Douglas as Southwest Main Street. This section passes through Douglas State Forest and is one of the most remote parts of the route that is still used as a public road. A section here was still unpaved until 2002. At the center of Douglas, the Post Road follows Massachusetts Route 16 eastward to East Douglas. Where Route 16 turns south, the Post Road continues east as Northeast Main Street, which leads to the Uxbridge town line. French General Lafayette traveled this road to join forces with Washington, and stopped in Douglas during the Revolutionary War.
;Uxbridge
Entering Uxbridge, the name of the road changes to Hartford Avenue. Hartford Avenue is a major cross-town road and follows the route of the Post Road for its entire length. From the Douglas town line to the intersection of Massachusetts Route 122, it is known as Hartford Avenue West; from Route 122 to the Mendon town line, it is known as Hartford Avenue East. The original stone arch bridge over the Blackstone Canal is still in use today. There was a Civil War encampment near the stone-arch bridge, and the road was used by troops during the French and Indian Wars and as a supply route during the War of 1812. George Washington stopped here a number of times when traveling this road, including when he took command of the Continental Army at Boston in 1775, and on his post-Inaugural tour of New England in 1789.

;Mendon
The Post Road enters the town from Uxbridge as Hartford Avenue West. It follows that road to Route 16, which follows the route of the Post Road for approximately one-half-mile eastward to Maple Street, which follows the route into Mendon town center. From there, the Post Road followed a Providence-Worcester post road south out of the village. This section is now part of Providence Street. About south of the town center the roads diverged. The Post Road heads east, now known as Hartford Avenue East. This road follows the original Post Road route to the Bellingham town line. Historic milestone 37 is still located along the route.

;Bellingham
The Post Road enters from Mendon as Hartford Avenue. Massachusetts Route 126 joins the road shortly before crossing over Interstate 495. Route 126 follows the Post Road route the remainder of the way to the Medway town line.

;Medway
The original Post Road from Mendon followed Village Street through Medway to the Tavern and Inn in Medway Village near the Charles River. The post road followed (present day) Village Street through Millis (part of Medway until 1885). In the early 19th century, the Hartford and Dedham Turnpike was built (now Rt 109), a straight route built through the Great Black Swamp, and up a large hill in the center of town.

;Millis
The original Post Road in Millis followed Village St from Medway, crossing current Massachusetts Rt 109, and then following the current Dover Road to the location of a series of Bridges over the Charles River leading into Medfield. In the period from 1806 to 1810, the Hartford and Dedham Turnpike was built (now Route 109), nearly going broke in attempting to build a causeway over the Charles River at the Medfield town line and through the Great Black Swamp.

;Medfield
;Dedham

The upper post road (US 20) also runs through Weston, and links directly to The Gifford School

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Long Walk&quot; – a novel by Stephen King published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman in 1979 as a paperback original – revolves around the contestants of a gruelling walking contest along a route that roughly follows and extends beyond the Boston Post Road.
* In the 1957 &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode &quot;Lucy Raises Tulips&quot;, Lucy loses control of a riding lawn mower while mowing the lawn at the Ricardos&#x27; Westport home, and later describes riding it down the Boston Post Road &quot;for a mile and a half, against traffic all the way&quot;.

<text>Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like &#x27;pod&#x27; suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

==History==
In 1966, Canadian Domina Jalbert was granted a patent for a &quot;multi-cell wing type aerial device—&quot;&quot;a wing having a flexible canopy constituting an upper skin and with a plurality of longitudinally extending ribs forming in effect a wing corresponding to an airplane wing airfoil... More particularly the invention contemplates the provision of a wing of rectangular or other shape having a canopy or top skin and a lower spaced apart bottom skin&quot;, a governable gliding parachute with multi-cells and controls for glide.

In 1954, Walter Neumark predicted (in an article in &quot;Flight&quot; magazine) a time when a glider pilot would be &quot;able to launch himself by running over the edge of a cliff or down a slope ... whether on a rock-climbing holiday in Skye or skiing in the Alps.&quot;

In 1961, the French engineer Pierre Lemongine produced improved parachute designs that led to the Para-Commander (PC). The Para-Commander had cutouts at the rear and sides that enabled it to be towed into the air and steered, leading to parasailing/parascending.

Domina Jalbert invented the parafoil, which had sectioned cells in an aerofoil shape, an open leading edge, a closed trailing edge, and was inflated by passage through the airthe design. He filed US Patent 3131894 on January 10, 1963.

About that time, David Barish was developing the sail wing (single-surface wing) for recovery of NASA space capsules—&quot;slope soaring was a way of testing out... the Sail Wing.&quot; After tests on Hunter Mountain, New York, in September 1965, he went on to promote slope soaring as a summer activity for ski resorts.

Author Walter Neumark wrote &quot;Operating Procedures for Ascending Parachutes&quot;, and in 1973 he and a group of enthusiasts with a passion for tow-launching PCs and ram-air parachutes broke away from the British Parachute Association to form the British Association of Parascending Clubs (which later became the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association). In 1997, Neumark was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club of the UK. Authors Patrick Gilligan (Canada) and Bertrand Dubuis (Switzerland) wrote the first flight manual, &quot;The Paragliding Manual&quot; in 1985, coining the word &quot;paragliding&quot;.

These developments were combined in June 1978 by three friends, Jean-Claude Bétemps, André Bohn and Gérard Bosson, from Mieussy, Haute-Savoie, France. After inspiration from an article on slope soaring in the &quot;Parachute Manual&quot; magazine by parachutist and publisher Dan Poynter, they calculated that on a suitable slope, a &quot;square&quot; ram-air parachute could be inflated by running down the slope; Bétemps launched from Pointe du Pertuiset, Mieussy, and flew 100 m. Bohn followed him and glided down to the football pitch in the valley 1000 metres below. Parapente ( being French for &#x27;slope&#x27;) was born.

From the 1980s, equipment has continued to improve, and the number of paragliding pilots and established sites has continued to increase. The first (unofficial) Paragliding World Championship was held in Verbier, Switzerland, in 1987, though the first officially sanctioned FAI World Paragliding Championship was held in Kössen, Austria, in 1989.

Europe has seen the greatest growth in paragliding, with France alone registering in 2011 over 25,000 active pilots.

Starting in 2022, feasibility studies of paragliding from above 8000meters have been in progress in the Everest region of Nepal this would effectively be paragliding from the highest starting altitude on the planet.

== Equipment ==

=== Wing ===
The paraglider wing or canopy is usually what is known in engineering as a &quot;ram-air airfoil&quot;. Such wings comprise two layers of fabric that are connected to internal supporting material in such a way as to form a row of cells. By leaving most of the cells open only at the leading edge, incoming air keeps the wing inflated, thus maintaining its shape. When inflated, the wing&#x27;s cross-section has the typical teardrop aerofoil shape. Modern paraglider wings are made of high-performance non-porous materials such as ripstop nylon.

In most modern paragliders (from the 1990s onwards), some of the cells of the leading edge are closed to form a cleaner aerodynamic profile. Holes in the internal ribs allow a free flow of air from the open cells to these closed cells to inflate them, and also to the wingtips, which are also closed. Almost all modern paragliders follow a &quot;sharknose&quot; design of the leading edge, by which the inflation opening is not at the front of the wing, but slightly backwards on the underside of the wing, and following a concave shape. This design, resembling the nose of a shark, increases wing stability and stall resistance. In modern paragliders, semi-flexible rods made out of plastic or nitinol are used to give extra stability to the profile of the wing. In high-performance paragliders, these rods extend through most of the length of the upper wing.

The pilot is supported underneath the wing by a network of suspension lines. These start with two sets of risers made of short () lengths of strong webbing. Each set is attached to the harness by a carabiner, one on each side of the pilot, and each riser of a set is generally attached to lines from only one row of its side of wing. At the end of each riser of the set, there is a small delta maillon with a number (2–5) of lines attached, forming a fan. These are typically long, with the end attached to 2–4 further lines of around m, which are again joined to a group of smaller, thinner lines. In some cases this is repeated for a fourth cascade.

The top of each line is attached to small fabric loops sewn into the structure of the wing, which are generally arranged in rows running span-wise (i.e., side to side). The row of lines nearest the front are known as the A lines, the next row back the B lines, and so on. A typical wing will have A, B, C and D lines, but recently, there has been a tendency to reduce the rows of lines to three, or even two (and experimentally to one), to reduce drag.

Paraglider lines are usually made from UHMW polythene or aramid. Although they look rather slender, these materials are strong and subject to load testing requirements. For example, a single 0.66 mm-diameter line (about the thinnest used) can have a breaking strength of .

Paraglider wings typically have an area of with a span of and weigh . Combined weight of wing, harness, reserve, instruments, helmet, etc. is around . Ultralight Hike &amp; Fly kits can be lighter than .

The glide ratio of paragliders ranges from 9.3 for recreational wings to about 11.3 for modern competition models, reaching in some cases up to 13. For comparison, a typical skydiving parachute will achieve about 3:1 glide. A hang glider ranges from 9.5 for recreational wings to about 16.5 for modern competition models. An idling (gliding) Cessna 152 light aircraft will achieve 9:1. Some sailplanes can achieve a glide ratio of up to 72:1.

The speed range of paragliders is typically , from stall speed to maximum speed. Achieving maximum speed requires the use of speedbar, or trimmers. Without these, and without applying brakes, a paraglider is at its trim speed, which is typically and often at the best glide ratio, too. High-performance paragliders meant for competitions may achieve faster accelerated flight, as do speedwings, due to their small size and different profile.

For storage and carrying, the wing is usually folded into a stuffsack (bag), which can then be stowed in a large backpack along with the harness. Some modern harnesses include the ability to turn the harness inside out such that it becomes a backpack, saving weight and space.

Paragliders are unique among human-carrying aircraft in being easily portable. The complete equipment packs into a rucksack and can be carried easily on the pilot&#x27;s back, in a car, or on public transport. In comparison with other air sports, this substantially simplifies travel to a suitable takeoff spot, the selection of a landing place and return travel.

Tandem paragliders, designed to carry the pilot and one passenger, are larger but otherwise similar. They usually fly faster with higher trim speeds, are more resistant to collapse, and have a slightly higher sink rate compared to solo paragliders.

=== Harness ===
The pilot is loosely and comfortably buckled into a harness, which offers support in both the standing and sitting positions. Most harnesses have protectors made out of foam or other materials underneath the seat and behind the back to reduce the impact on failed launches or landings. Modern harnesses are designed to be as comfortable as a lounge chair in the sitting or reclining position. Many harnesses even have an adjustable lumbar support. A reserve parachute is also typically connected to a paragliding harness.

Harnesses also vary according to the need of the pilot, and thereby come in a range of designs, mostly:
* open harnesses, ranging from training harness for beginners to all-round harnesses
* pod harnesses for long-distance cross-country flights
* competition harnesses, which are pod harnesses with the capacity to carry two reserve parachutes
* acro harnesses, a type of open harness, designed for acrobatic paragliding, with the capacity for two or three reserve parachutes
* hike&amp;fly harnesses, which are designed to be lightweight and compact when folded away for hiking
* harnesses for tandem pilots and passengers
* kids tandem harnesses are also now available with special child-proof locks

Harnesses have a substantial influence on the flying characteristics; for instance, acro harnesses lead to more agile handling, which is desirable for flying acrobatics, but may be unsuitable for beginners or XC pilots looking for more stability in flight. While pod harnesses offer more stability and aerodynamic properties, they increase the risk of riser twist, and are hence not suitable for beginners. The standard harness is an open harness, which features a sitting, slightly reclined body position.

=== Instruments in paragliding ===
Most pilots use variometers, radios, and, increasingly, GNSS units when they are flying.

;Variometer

The main purpose of a variometer is in helping a pilot find and stay in the &quot;core&quot; of a thermal to maximise height gain and, conversely, to indicate when a pilot is in sinking air and needs to find rising air.
Humans can sense the acceleration when they first hit a thermal, but cannot detect the difference between constant rising air and constant sinking air. Modern variometers are capable of detecting rates of climb or sink of 1 cm per second.
A variometer indicates climb rate (or sink-rate) with short audio signals (beeps, which increase in pitch and tempo during ascent, and a droning sound, which gets deeper as the rate of descent increases) and/or a visual display. It also shows altitude: either above takeoff, above sea level, or (at higher altitudes) flight level.

;Radio
Radio communications are used in training, to communicate with other pilots, and to report where and when they intend to land. These radios normally operate on a range of frequencies in different countries—some authorised, some illegal but tolerated locally. Some local authorities (e.g., flight clubs) offer periodic automated weather updates on these frequencies. In rare cases, pilots use radios to talk to airport control towers or air traffic controllers.
Many pilots carry a cell phone so they can call for pickup should they land away from their intended point of destination.

;GNSS
GNSS is a necessary accessory when flying competitions, where it has to be demonstrated that way-points have been correctly passed.
The recorded GNSS track of a flight can be used to analyze flying technique or can be shared with other pilots. GNSS is also used to determine drift due to the prevailing wind when flying at altitude, providing position information to allow restricted airspace to be avoided and identifying one&#x27;s location for retrieval teams after landing out in unfamiliar territory.
GNSS is integrated with some models of variometer. This is not only more convenient, but also allows for a three-dimensional record of the flight. The flight track can be used as proof for record claims, replacing the old method of photo documentation.

Increasingly, smart phones are used as the primary means of navigation and flight logging, with several applications available to assist in air navigation. They are also used to co-ordinate tasks in competitive paragliding and facilitate retrieval of pilots returning to their point of launch. External variometers are typically used to assist in accurate altitude information.

== Ground handling ==

Paraglider ground handling, also known as kiting, is the practice of handling the paraglider on land. The primary purpose of ground handling is to practice the skills necessary for launching and landing. However, ground handling could be considered a fun and challenging sport in and of itself.

Ground handling is considered an essential part of most paragliding wing management training. It needs to be remembered that in any sort of stumble or tumble, the head is at risk and a helmet is therefore always advisable.

It is highly recommended that low hour pilots, ground-handling, should be wearing a formal harness with leg and waist straps firmly fitted and fastened. Since 2015 the standard harness has become an inflatable type. This forms a protective cushion when, during flight, air is forced through a check valve and retained in a chamber behind and under the pilot. In ground-handling practice the amount of air passing through the check valve may be very slight. In an accident where the pilot has been lifted and dumped while facing downwind, the protection offered by an inflatable harness is likely to be minimal. The old fashioned foam type of harness has a special value in that sort of situation.
=== Location ===
The ideal launch training site for novices with standard wings has the following characteristics:
* Measured steady wind strength: 1 m/s to 4 m/s (3.6–14 km/h: 1.9-7.7 knots: 2.2-8.9 mph)
* The even, flat, surface should slope slightly downwards (2 or 3 degrees) from down-wind to up-wind (providing a small vertical lift component).
* The site must be isolated from uninvolved visitors.
* Free of obstructions that might create a trip or snag hazard.
* Soft surface, such as grass or sand, to reduce damage to the handler and wing in case of falls.
* Novices should wear a harness and helmet and be accompanied by an appropriate adult.
As pilots progress, they may challenge themselves by kiting over and around obstacles, in strong or turbulent wind, and on greater slopes.

== Flying ==

=== Launching ===
As with all aircraft, launching and landing are done into wind. The wing is placed into an airstream, either by running or being pulled, or an existing wind. The wing moves up over the pilot into a position in which it can carry the passenger. The pilot is then lifted from the ground and, after a safety period, can sit down into his harness. Unlike skydivers, paragliders, like hang gliders, do not jump at any time during this process. There are two launching techniques used on higher ground and one assisted launch technique used in flatland areas:

==== Forward launch ====
In low winds, the wing is inflated with a forward launch, where the pilot runs forward with the wing behind so that the air pressure generated by the forward movement inflates the wing.

It is often easier, because the pilot only has to run forward, but the pilot cannot see his wing until it is above him, where he has to check it in a very short time for correct inflation and untangled lines before the launch.

==== Reverse launch ====
In higher winds, a reverse launch is used, with the pilot facing the wing to bring it up into a flying position, then turning around under the wing and running to complete the launch.

Reverse launches have a number of advantages over a forward launch. It is more straightforward to inspect the wing and check if the lines are free as it leaves the ground. In the presence of wind, the pilot can be tugged toward the wing, and facing the wing makes it easier to resist this force and safer in case the pilot slips (as opposed to being dragged backwards). However, the movement pattern is more complex than forward launch, and the pilot has to hold the brakes in a correct way and turn to the correct side so he does not tangle the lines. These launches are normally attempted with a reasonable wind speed, making the ground speed required to pressurise the wing much lower.

The launch is initiated by the hands raising the leading edge with the As. As it rises the wing is controlled more by centring the feet than by use of the brakes or Cs. With mid level wings (EN C and D) the wing may try to &quot;overshoot&quot; the pilot as it nears the top. This is checked with Cs or brakes. The wing becomes increasingly sensitive to the Cs and brakes as its internal air pressure rises. This is usually felt from increasing lift of the wing applying harness pressure to the seat of the pants. That pressure indicates that the wing is likely to remain stable when the pilot pirouettes to face the wind.

The next step in the launch is to bring the wing into the lift zone. There are two techniques for accomplishing this depending on wind conditions. In light wind this is usually done after turning to the front, steering with the feet towards the low wing tip, and applying light brakes in a natural sense to keep the wing horizontal. In stronger wind conditions it is often found to be easier to remain facing downwind while moving slowly and steadily backwards into the wind.

Knees bent to load the wing, foot adjustments to remain central and minimum use of Cs or Brakes to keep the wing horizontal. Pirouette when the feet are close to lifting. This option has two distinct advantages. a) The pilot can see the wing centre marker (an aid to centring the feet) and, if necessary, b) the pilot can move briskly towards the wing to assist with an emergency deflation.

With either method it is essential to check &quot;traffic&quot; across the launch face before committing to flight.

The A&#x27;s and C&#x27;s technique described above is well suited to low-hours pilots, on standard wings, in wind strengths up to 10 knots. It is particularly recommended for kiting. As wind speed increases (above ten knots), especially on steep ridges, the use of the C&#x27;s introduces the potential to be lifted before the wing is overhead due to the increased angle of attack. That type of premature lift often results in the pilot&#x27;s weight swinging downwind rapidly, resulting in a frontal tuck (due to excess A line loads). In that situation the pilot commonly drops vertically and injuries are not uncommon. In ridge soaring situations above ten knots it is almost always better to lift the wing with A&#x27;s only and use the brakes to stop any potential overshoot. The brakes do not usually increase the angle of attack as much C&#x27;s. As wind strength increases it becomes more important than ever for the pilot to keep the wing loaded by bending the knees and pushing the shoulders forward. Most pilots will find that when their hands are vertically under the brake line pulleys they are able reduce trailing edge drag to the absolute minimum. That is not so easy for most, when the arms are thrust rearwards.

==== Towed launch ====
In flatter countryside, pilots can also be launched with a tow. Once at full height (towing can launch pilots up to altitude), the pilot pulls a release cord, and the towline falls away. This requires separate training, as flying on a winch has quite different characteristics from free flying. There are two major ways to tow: pay-in and pay-out towing. Pay-in towing involves a stationary winch that winds in the towline and thereby pulls the pilot in the air. The distance between winch and pilot at the start is around or more. Pay-out towing involves a moving object, like a car or a boat, that pays out line slower than the speed of the object, thereby pulling the pilot up in the air. In both cases, it is very important to have a gauge indicating line tension to avoid pulling the pilot out of the air. Another form of towing is static line towing. This involves a moving object, like a car or a boat, attached to a paraglider or hang glider with a fixed-length line. This can be very dangerous, because now the forces on the line have to be controlled by the moving object itself, which is almost impossible to do, unless stretchy rope and a pressure/tension meter (dynamometer) is used. Static line towing with stretchy rope and a load cell as a tension meter has been used in Poland, Ukraine, Russia, and other Eastern European countries for over 20 years (under the name &quot;Malinka&quot;) with about the same safety record as other forms of towing.

One more form of towing is hand towing. This is where 1−3 people pull a paraglider using a tow rope of up to . The stronger the wind, the fewer people are needed for a successful hand tow. Tows up to have been accomplished, allowing the pilot to get into a lift band of a nearby ridge or row of buildings and ridge-soar in the lift the same way as with a regular foot launch.

=== Landing ===

Landing a paraglider, as with all unpowered aircraft which cannot abort a landing, involves some specific techniques and traffic patterns. Paragliding pilots most commonly lose their height by flying a figure 8 over a landing zone until they reach the correct height, then line up into the wind and give the glider full speed. Once the correct height (about a metre above ground) is achieved the pilot will stall the glider in order to land.

==== Traffic pattern ====

Unlike during launch, where coordination between multiple pilots is straightforward, landing involves more planning, because more than one pilot might have to land at the same time. Therefore, a specific traffic pattern has been established. Pilots line up into a position above the airfield and to the side of the landing area, which is dependent on the wind direction, where they can lose height (if necessary) by flying circles. From this position, they follow the legs of a flightpath in a rectangular pattern to the landing zone: downwind leg, base leg, and final approach. This allows for synchronization between multiple pilots and reduces the risk of collisions, because a pilot can anticipate what other pilots around him are going to do next.

==== Techniques ====

Landing involves lining up for an approach into wind and, just before touching down, flaring the wing to minimise vertical and/or horizontal speed. This consists of gently going from 0% brake at around two metres to 100% brake when touching down on the ground.

During the approach descent, at around four metres before touching ground, some momentary braking (50% for around two seconds) can be applied then released, thus using forward pendular momentum to gain speed for flaring more effectively and approaching the ground with minimal vertical speed.

In light winds, some minor running is common. In moderate to medium headwinds, the landings can be without forward speed, or even going backwards with respect to the ground in strong winds. Landing with winds which force the pilot backwards are particularly hazardous as there is a potential to tumble and be dragged. While the wing is vertically above the pilot there is potential for a reduced risk deflation. This involves taking the leading edge lines (As) in each hand at the mallion/riser junction and applying the pilot&#x27;s full weight with a deep knee bend action. In almost every case the wing&#x27;s leading edge will fly forward a little and then tuck. It is then likely to collapse and descend upwind of the pilot. On the ground it will be restrained by the pilot&#x27;s legs.

Landing in winds which are too strong for the wing is to be avoided wherever possible. During approach to the intended landing site this potential problem is often obvious and there may be opportunities to extend the flight to find a more sheltered landing area. On every landing it is desirable to have the wing remain flyable with a small amount of forward momentum. This makes deflation much more controllable. While the midsection lines (Bs) are vertical there is much less chance of the wing moving downwind fast. The common deflation cue comes from a vigorous tug on the rear risers&#x27; lines (Cs or Ds). Promptly rotate to face down wind, maintain pressure on the rear risers and take brisk steps towards the wing as it falls. With practice there is potential for precision enabling safe trouble-free landing.

For strong winds during the landing approach, flapping the wing (symmetrical pulsing of brakes) is a common option on final. It reduces the wing&#x27;s lift performance. The descent rate is increases by the alternate application and release of the brakes about once per second. (The amount of brake applied in each cycle being variable but about 25%.) The system depends on the pilot&#x27;s wing familiarity. The wing must not become stalled. This should be established with gentle applications in flight, at a safe height, in good conditions and with an observer providing feedback. As a rule the manufacturer has set the safe-brake-travel-range based on average body proportions for pilots in the approved weight range. Making changes to that setting should be undertaken in small increases, with tell-tale marks showing the variations and a test flight to confirm the desired effect. Shortening the brake lines can produce the problematic effect of making the wing sluggish. Lengthening brakes excessively can make it hard to bring the wing to a safe touchdown speed.

Alternative approach techniques for landing in strong winds include the use of a speed bar and big ears. A speed bar increases wing penetration and adds a small increase in the vertical descent rate. This makes it easier to adjust descent rates during a formal circuit. In an extreme situation it might be advisable to stand on the speed bar, after shifting out of the harness, and stay on it till touchdown and deflation. Big ears are commonly applied during circuit height management. The vertical descent speed is increased and that advantage can be used to bring the glider to an appropriate circuit joining height. Most manufacturers change the operation technique for big ears in advanced models. It is common for Big Ears in C-rated gliders to remain folded in after the control line is released. In those cases the wing can be landed with reasonable safety with big ears deployed. In those wing types it usually takes two or three symmetrical pumps with brakes, over a second or two, to re-inflate the tips. In lower rated wings the Big Ears need the line to remain held to hold the ears in. While they are held-in the wing tends to respond to weight shift slightly better (due to reduced effective area) on the roll axis. They auto re-inflate when the line is released. In general those wings are better suited to the situation where the ears are pulled in simply to get rid of excess height. Full-wing flight should then be resumed during base leg or several seconds before touch down. Wing familiarity is a key ingredient in applying these controls. Pilots should practise in medium conditions in a safe area, at a safe height and with options for landing.

=== Control ===
Brakes: controls held in each of the pilot&#x27;s hands connect to the trailing edge of the left and right sides of the wing. These controls are called brakes and provide the primary and most general means of control in a paraglider. The brakes are used to adjust speed, to steer (in addition to weight shift), and to flare (during landing).

Weight shift: in addition to manipulating the brakes, a paraglider pilot must also lean in order to steer properly. Such weight shifting can also be used for more limited steering when brake use is unavailable, such as when under &quot;big ears&quot; (see below). More advanced control techniques may also involve weight shifting.

Speed bar: a kind of foot control called the speed bar (also accelerator) attaches to the paragliding harness and connects to the leading edge of the paraglider wing, usually through a system of at least two pulleys (see animation in margin). This control is used to increase speed and does so by decreasing the wing&#x27;s angle of attack. This control is necessary because the brakes can only slow the wing from what is called trim speed (no brakes applied). The accelerator is needed to go faster than this.

More advanced means of control can be obtained by manipulating the paraglider&#x27;s risers or lines directly. Most commonly, the lines connecting to the outermost points of the wing&#x27;s leading edge can be used to induce the wingtips to fold under. The technique, known as &quot;big ears&quot;, is used to increase the rate of descent (see picture and the full description below). The risers connecting to the rear of the wing can also be manipulated for steering if the brakes have been severed or are otherwise unavailable. For ground-handling purposes, a direct manipulation of these lines can be more effective and offer more control than the brakes. The effect of sudden wind blasts can be countered by directly pulling on the risers and making the wing unflyable, thereby avoiding falls or unintentional takeoffs.

==== Fast descents ====
Problems with getting down can occur when the lift situation is very good or when the weather changes unexpectedly. There are three possibilities for rapidly reducing altitude in such situations, each of which has benefits and issues to be aware of. The &quot;big ears&quot; manoeuvre induces descent rates of 2.5 to 3.5 m/s, 4–6 m/s with additional speed bar. It is the most controllable of the techniques and the easiest for beginners to learn. The B-line stall induces descent rates of 6–10 m/s. It increases loading on parts of the wing (the pilot&#x27;s weight is mostly on the B-lines, instead of spread across all the lines). Finally, a spiral dive offers the fastest rate of descent, at 7–25 m/s. It places greater loads on the wing than other techniques do and requires the highest level of skill from the pilot to execute safely.

;Big ears

:Pulling on the outer A-lines during non-accelerated, normal flight folds the wing tips inwards, which substantially reduces the glide angle with only a small decrease in forward speed. As the effective wing area is reduced, the wing loading is increased, and it becomes more stable. However, the angle of attack is increased, and the craft is closer to stall speed, but this can be ameliorated by applying the speed bar, which also increases the descent rate. When the lines are released, the wing re-inflates. If necessary, a short pumping on the brakes helps reestablish normal flight. Compared to the other techniques, with big ears, the wing still glides forward, which enables the pilot to leave an area of danger. Even landing this way is possible, e.g., if the pilot has to counter an updraft on a slope.

;B-line stall
:In a B-line stall, the second set of risers from the leading-edge/front (the B-lines) are pulled down independently of the other risers, with the specific lines used to initiate a stall. This puts a spanwise crease in the wing, thereby separating the airflow from the upper surface of the wing. It dramatically reduces the lift produced by the canopy and thus induces a higher rate of descent. This can be a strenuous manoeuvre, because these B-lines have to be held in this position, and the tension of the wing puts an upwards force on these lines. The release of these lines has to be handled carefully not to provoke a too fast forward shooting of the wing, which the pilot then could fall into. This is less popular now as it induces high loads on the internal structure of the wing.

;Spiral dive
:The spiral dive is the most rapid form of controlled fast descent; an aggressive spiral dive can achieve a sink rate of 25 m/s. This manoeuvre halts forward progress and brings the flier almost straight down. The pilot pulls the brakes on one side and shifts his weight onto that side to induce a sharp turn. The flight path then begins to resembles a corkscrew. After a specific downward speed is reached, the wing points directly to the ground. When the pilot reaches his desired height, he ends this manoeuvre by slowly releasing the inner brake, shifting his weight to the outer side and braking on this side. The release of the inner brake has to be handled carefully to end the spiral dive gently in a few turns. If done too fast, the wing translates the turning into a dangerous upward and pendular motion.
:Spiral dives put a strong G-force on the wing and glider and must be done carefully and skilfully. The G-forces involved can induce blackouts, and the rotation can produce disorientation. Some high-end gliders have what is called a &quot;stable spiral problem&quot;. After inducing a spiral and without further pilot input, some wings do not automatically return to normal flight and stay inside their spiral. Serious injury and fatal accidents have occurred when pilots could not exit this manoeuvre and spiralled into the ground.

The rate of rotation in a spiral dive can be reduced by using a drogue chute, deployed just before the spiral is induced. This reduces the G forces experienced.

=== Ridge lift ===
Ridge lift is achieved by using wind directed upwards by a fixed object such as a dune or ridge.
To achieve this, pilots fly along the length of a slope feature in the landscape, relying on the lift provided by the air, which is forced up as it passes over the slope. This type of lift is highly dependent on a steady wind within a defined range (the suitable range depends on the performance of the wing and the skill of the pilot). Too little wind, and insufficient lift is available to stay airborne (pilots end up &#x27;scratching&#x27; along the slope). With more wind, gliders can fly well above and forward of the slope, but too much wind, and there is a risk of being blown back over the slope. A particular form of ridge soaring is called condo soaring, where pilots soar a row of buildings that form an artificial ridge. This form of soaring is particularly used in flat lands where there are no natural ridges, but there are plenty of man-made building ridges.

=== Thermal flying ===

When the sun warms the ground, the ground will radiate some of its heat to a thin layer of air situated just above it. Air has very poor thermal conductivity and most of the heat transfer in it will be convective - forming rising columns of hot air, called thermals. If the terrain is not uniform, it will warm some features more than others (such as rock faces or large buildings) and these thermals will tend to always form at the same spot, otherwise they will be more random. Sometimes these may be a simple rising column of air; more often, they are blown sideways in the wind and will break off from the source, with a new thermal forming later.

Once a pilot finds a thermal, he begins to fly in a circle, trying to centre the circle on the strongest part of the thermal (the &quot;core&quot;), where the air is rising the fastest. Most pilots use a vario-altimeter (&quot;vario&quot;), which indicates climb rate with beeps and/or a visual display, to help core in on a thermal.

Often there is strong sink surrounding thermals, and there is also strong turbulence resulting in wing collapses as a pilot tries to enter a strong thermal. Good thermal flying is a skill that takes time to learn, but a good pilot can often core a thermal all the way to cloud base.

=== Cross-country flying ===
Once the skills of using thermals to gain altitude have been mastered, pilots can glide from one thermal to the next to go cross country. Having gained altitude in a thermal, a pilot glides down to the next available thermal.

Potential thermals can be identified by land features that typically generate thermals or by cumulus clouds, which mark the top of a rising column of warm, humid air as it reaches the dew point and condenses to form a cloud.

Cross-country pilots also need an intimate familiarity with air law, flying regulations, aviation maps indicating restricted airspace, etc.

=== In-flight wing deflation (collapse) ===
Since the shape of the wing (airfoil) is formed by the moving air entering and inflating the wing, in turbulent air, part or all of the wing can deflate (collapse). Piloting techniques referred to as active flying will greatly reduce the frequency and severity of deflations or collapses. On modern recreational wings, such deflations will normally recover without pilot intervention. In the event of a severe deflation, correct pilot input will speed recovery from a deflation, but incorrect pilot input may slow the return of the glider to normal flight, so pilot training and practice in correct response to deflations are necessary.

For the rare occasions when it is not possible to recover from a deflation (or from other threatening situations such as a spin), most pilots carry a reserve (rescue, emergency) parachute (or even two); however, most pilots never have cause to &quot;throw&quot; their reserve. Should a wing deflation occur at low altitude, i.e., shortly after takeoff or just before landing, the wing (paraglider) may not recover its correct structure rapidly enough to prevent an accident, with the pilot often not having enough altitude remaining to deploy a reserve parachute [with the minimum altitude for this being approximately , but typical deployment to stabilization periods using up of altitude] successfully. Different packing methods of the reserve parachute affect its deploying time.

Low-altitude wing failure can result in serious injury or death due to the subsequent velocity of a ground impact whereas a higher altitude failure may allow more time to regain some degree of control in the descent rate and, critically, deploy the reserve if needed. In-flight wing deflation and other hazards are minimized by flying a suitable glider and choosing appropriate weather conditions and locations for the pilot&#x27;s skill and experience level.

== As a competitive sport ==
There are various disciplines of competitive paragliding:
* Cross-country flying is the classical form of paragliding competitions with championships in club, regional, national and international levels. The two top level competitions are:
**World Paragliding Championships
**Paragliding World Cup
* Aerobatic competitions demand the participants to perform certain manoeuvres. Competitions are held for individual pilots as well as for pairs that show synchronous performances. This form is the most spectacular for spectators on the ground to watch.
* Hike &amp; Fly competitions, in which a certain route has to be flown or hiked only over several days: Red Bull X-Alps—the unofficial world championship in this category of competition—first launched in 2003 and has since taken place every other year. Since 2012, the similar X-Pyr cross-Pyrenees competition has taken place in the even years. Many other Hike and Fly competitions occur today worldwide.

In addition to these organized events it is also possible to participate in various online contests that require participants to upload flight track data to dedicated websites like OLC.

== Safety ==

Paragliding, like any adventure sport, is a potentially dangerous activity. In the United States, for example, in 2010 (the last year for which details are available), one paraglider pilot died. This is an equivalent rate of one in 5,000 pilots. In 2019, YouTube personality Grant Thompson of The King Of Random died in a paraglider accident. Over the years 1994−2010, an average of seven in every 10,000 active paraglider pilots have been fatally injured, though with a marked improvement in recent years. In France (with over 25,000 registered fliers), two of every 10,000 pilots were fatally injured in 2011 (a rate that is not atypical of the years 2007−2011), although around six of every 1,000 pilots were seriously injured (more than two-day hospital stay).

The potential for injury can be significantly reduced by training and risk management. The use of proper equipment such as a wing designed for the pilot&#x27;s size and skill level, as well as a helmet, a reserve parachute, and a cushioned harness also minimize risk. Pilot safety is influenced by an understanding of the site conditions such as air turbulence (rotors), strong thermals, gusty wind, and ground obstacles such as power lines. Sufficient pilot training in wing control and emergency manoeuvres from competent instructors can minimize accidents. Many paragliding accidents are the result of a combination of pilot error and poor flying conditions.

SIV, short for Simulation d&#x27;Incident en Vol (simulation of incident in flight) instruction offers training in managing and preventing unstable and potentially dangerous situations such as collapses, full stalls, and cravattes. These courses are typically led by a specially trained instructor over large bodies of water, with the student usually being instructed via radio. Students will be taught how to induce dangerous situations, and thus learn how to both avoid and remedy them once induced. This course is recommended to pilots who are looking to move to more high performance and less stable wings, which is a natural progression for most pilots. In some countries a SIV course is a basic requirement of initial pilot training. In the event of an unrecoverable manoeuvre resulting in water landing, a rescue boat is typically dispatched to collect the pilot. Other added safety features may include buoyancy aids or secondary reserve parachutes. These courses are not considered essential for novice level flying.

Before scheduling a paragliding adventure, verify weather conditions to ensure flight safety. Check the pilot&#x27;s qualifications, ensuring they hold a P4 or P5 certification, which includes extensive experience and training in emergency procedures. Engage with the pilot beforehand to assess their experience and ensure they are well-rested, as fatigue becomes a risk factor after multiple flights. Inspect the paragliding equipment for wear and tear, focusing on components like the canopy, brake lines, and reserve parachute, which should be regularly maintained. Finally, confirm the operator&#x27;s licenses and permissions, and practice ground handling skills under guidance before takeoff to enhance safety and control. 

==Fitness and age==

Paragliding in ordinary circumstances is not especially demanding in terms of strength. It sometimes needs a Pilot to walk with equipment to and from a launch site and this occasionally requires assistance from a friend or colleague. Age is more significant in people past their fifties. This especially relates to those with artificial joints. An unexpected or heavy landing can put enormous pressure on the bones which serve as anchors for hips and knee joints. Due to increasing loss of bone density in senior pilots, there is an increased risk that during a bad landing a bone may shatter and this considerably complicates moving to an appropriate treatment centre. Currently surgeons often rate these prosthetic joints as being suitable only for smooth, steady, work loads. But even for those with ordinary knees and hips there is often a stiffness in walking and running which has a negative effect on launching. Pilots who recognise this minor debility usually avoid strong wind launches, which may demand the pilot to move briskly towards the wing during inflation.

There are pilots still flying while in their nineties but these are exceptional and they may very well depend on specific assistance. It is important for individuals to consult a doctor following any serious health event. It is especially important to carry, in one&#x27;s flight pack, an up to date list of details relating to medications and major health issues. [?]

==Instruction==

Most popular paragliding regions have a number of schools, generally registered with and/or organized by national associations. Certification systems vary widely between countries, though around 10 days instruction to basic certification is standard.

There are several key components to a paragliding pilot certification instruction program. Initial training for beginning pilots usually begins with some amount of ground school to discuss the basics, including elementary theories of flight as well as basic structure and operation of the paraglider.

Students then learn how to control the glider on the ground, practising take-offs and controlling the wing &#x27;overhead&#x27;. Low, gentle hills are next where students get their first short flights, flying at very low altitudes, to get used to the handling of the wing over varied terrain. Special winches can be used to tow the glider to low altitude in areas that have no hills readily available.

As their skills progress, students move on to steeper/higher hills (or higher winch tows), making longer flights, and learning to turn the glider, control the glider&#x27;s speed, then moving on to 360° turns, spot landings, &#x27;big ears&#x27; (used to increase the rate of descent for the paraglider), and other more advanced techniques. Training instructions are often provided to the student via radio, particularly during the first flights.

A third key component to a complete paragliding instructional program provides substantial background in the key areas of meteorology, aviation law, and general flight area etiquette.

To give prospective pilots a chance to determine if they would like to proceed with a full pilot training program, most schools offer tandem flights, in which an experienced instructor pilots the paraglider with the prospective pilot as a passenger. Schools often offer pilot&#x27;s families and friends the opportunity to fly tandem, and sometimes sell tandem pleasure flights at holiday resorts.

Most recognised courses lead to a national licence and an internationally recognised International Pilot Proficiency Information/Identification card. The IPPI specifies five stages of paragliding proficiency, from the entry level ParaPro 1 to the most advanced stage 5. Attaining a level of ParaPro 3 typically allows the pilot to fly solo or without instructor supervision.

==Related activities==

===Sky diving===
Parachutes have the most resemblance with paragliders but the sports are very different. Whereas with sky diving the parachute is a tool to safely return to earth after free fall, the paraglider allows longer flights and the use of thermals.

===Hang gliding===
Hang gliding is a close cousin, and hang glider and paraglider launches are often found in proximity to one another. Despite the considerable difference in equipment, the two activities offer similar pleasures, and some pilots are involved in both sports.

===Powered hang glider===

Foot-launched powered hang gliders are powered by an engine and propeller in pusher configuration. An ordinary hang glider is used for its wing and control frame, and the pilot can foot-launch from a hill or from flat ground.

===Powered paragliding===
Powered paragliding is the flying of paragliders with a small engine known as a paramotor attached. Powered paragliding is known as paramotoring and requires extra training alongside regular paragliding training. It is often recommended to become competent in paragliding prior to learning to paramotor in order to know fully what one is doing.

===Speed flying===
Speed flying, or &quot;speed riding&quot;, is the separate sport of flying paragliders of a reduced size. These wings have increased speed, though they are not normally capable of soaring flight. The sport involves taking off on skis or on foot and swooping rapidly down in close proximity to a slope, even periodically touching it if skis are used. These smaller wings are also sometimes used where wind speeds are too high for a full-sized paraglider, although this is invariably at coastal sites where the wind is laminar and not subject to as much mechanical turbulence as inland sites.

===Gliding===
Just like sailplanes and hang gliders, paragliders use thermals to extend the time in the air. Air speed, glide ratio and flight distances are superior to the ones achieved by paragliders. Paragliders on the other hand are able to also facilitate thermals that are too small (because of the much larger turn radius) or too weak for gliding.
Paragliding can be of local importance as a commercial activity. Paid accompanied tandem flights are available in many mountainous regions, both in the winter and in the summer. In addition, there are many schools offering courses and guides who lead groups of more experienced pilots exploring an area. Finally, there are the manufacturers and the associated repair and after-sales services. Paraglider-like wings also find other uses, for example, in ship propulsion and wind energy exploitation, and are related to some forms of power kite. Kite skiing uses equipment similar to paragliding sails.

<doc id="63503" wikidata="Q485708" url="?curid=63503" title="Duluth, Minnesota">
<text>Duluth ( ) is a port city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and the county seat of St. Louis County. Located on Lake Superior in Minnesota&#x27;s Arrowhead Region, the city is a hub for cargo shipping. The population was 86,697 at the 2020 census, making it Minnesota&#x27;s fifth-largest city. Duluth forms a metropolitan area with neighboring Superior, Wisconsin, called the Twin Ports. Duluth is south of the Iron Range and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. It is named after Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, the area&#x27;s first known European explorer.

Duluth is on the north shore of Lake Superior at the westernmost point of the Great Lakes. It is the largest metropolitan area, the second-largest city, and the largest U.S. city on the lake. Duluth is accessible to the Atlantic Ocean, away, via the Great Lakes Waterway and St. Lawrence Seaway. The Port of Duluth is the world&#x27;s farthest inland port accessible to oceangoing ships and is the largest and busiest port on the Great Lakes. It is also among the top 20 U.S. ports by tonnage. Common items shipped from Duluth include coal, iron ore, grain, limestone, cement, salt, wood pulp, steel coil, and wind turbine parts.

Duluth is a popular Midwest tourist destination. The city is home to the Great Lakes Aquarium, a freshwater aquarium. The Aerial Lift Bridge, next to Canal Park, crosses the Duluth Ship Canal into the Duluth–Superior harbor. Minnesota Point, known locally as Park Point, is the world&#x27;s longest freshwater baymouth bar, stretching . The city is also the starting point for road trips along the North Shore of Lake Superior to Thunder Bay, Ontario.

==History==
===Native history===
The Ojibwe occupied a historic settlement at &quot;Onigamiinsing&quot; (&quot;at the little portage&quot;), the portage across Minnesota Point between Lake Superior and western St. Louis Bay, which forms Duluth&#x27;s harbor. For both the Ojibwe and the Dakota, interaction with Europeans during the contact period revolved around the fur trade and related activities.

According to Ojibwe oral history, Spirit Island, near the Spirit Valley neighborhood, was the &quot;Sixth Stopping Place&quot; where the northern and southern branches of the Ojibwe Nation came together and proceeded to their &quot;Seventh Stopping Place&quot; near the present city of La Pointe, Wisconsin. The &quot;Stopping Places&quot; were places the Native Americans occupied during their westward migration as the Europeans overran their territory.

===Exploration and fur trade===

Several factors brought fur traders to the Great Lakes in the early 17th century. The fashion for beaver hats in Europe generated demand for pelts. The French trade for beavers in the lower St. Lawrence River led to the depletion of the animals in the region by the late 1630s, after which the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver furs.

Étienne Brûlé is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers explored the Duluth area, Fond du Lac (Bottom of the Lake), in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where Grand Portage became a major trading center. The French explorer Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, whose name is sometimes anglicized as &quot;DuLuth&quot;, explored the St. Louis River in 1679.

After 1792 and the independence of the United States, the North West Company established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, as well as in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the Dakota, and other native tribes. The first post was where Superior, Wisconsin, later developed; known as Fort St. Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West&#x27;s new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockade walls, two houses of each, a shed of , a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Native American peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed.

In 1808, German-born John Jacob Astor organized the American Fur Company. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day Fond du Lac on the St. Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with Lake Vermilion to the north and with the Mississippi River to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business around 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade continued until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions changed, and many American areas were getting over-trapped, causing game to decline.

In 1832, Henry Schoolcraft visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow based the Song of Hiawatha, his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft&#x27;s writings.

Natives signed two Treaties of Fond du Lac with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847; in them, the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa, the United States placed the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation upstream from Duluth near Cloquet, Minnesota.

===Permanent settlement===

As European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and subsequently relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations. Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of copper mining. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness lands for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a land rush, and led to the development of iron ore mining in the area. The 1854 Ojibwe Land Cession Treaty would force the Ojibwe onto what are now known as the Fond du Lac and Grand Portage Reservations, though some land rights such as hunting and fishing were retained.

Around the same time, newly constructed channels and locks in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the Twin Cities was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the St. Louis River were formed, establishing Duluth&#x27;s roots as a city.

By 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area&#x27;s economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the Panic of 1857, caused most of the city&#x27;s early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 says: &quot;Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer. Capital idea; build a brewery. The absence of malt and hops and barley did not at all embarrass those stout-hearted settlers.&quot; The water for brewing was obtained from a stream that emptied into Lake Superior that came to be called Brewery Creek. While the brewery &quot;was not a pecuniary success&quot;, it became the Fitger Brewing Company a few decades later.

The opening of the canal at Sault Ste. Marie in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads&#x27; approach made Duluth the only port with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Soon, the lumber industry, railroads, and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand; storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a Fourth of July speech, Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth&#x27;s first newspaper, coined the expression &quot;The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas&quot;.

In 1869–70, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years. When Jay Cooke, a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad to create an extension from St. Paul to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to iron ore mining. Duluth&#x27;s population on New Year&#x27;s Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the Fourth of July, 3,500 people were present to celebrate.

In the first &quot;Duluth Minnesotian&quot; printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:
In 1873, Cooke&#x27;s empire crumbled, and the stock market crashed, causing Duluth to almost disappear from the map. But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and the completion of the railroads, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce, and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the Mesabi Range, and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio. The trade continued into the 20th century.
====&quot;The Untold Delights of Duluth&quot;====
Early doubts about the Duluth area&#x27;s potential were voiced in &quot;The Untold Delights of Duluth,&quot; a speech U.S. Representative J. Proctor Knott of Kentucky gave in the U.S. House of Representatives on January 27, 1871. His speech opposing the St. Croix and Superior Land Grant lampooned Western boosterism, portraying Duluth as an Eden in fantastically florid terms. The speech has been reprinted in collections of folklore and humorous speeches and is regarded as a classic. The nearby city of Proctor, Minnesota, is named after Knott.

Duluth&#x27;s unofficial sister city, Duluth, Georgia, got its name in 1871 shortly after Knott&#x27;s speech gained national attention. Prominent Georgia newspaperman and politician Evan Howell had been called upon to make remarks at the dedication of a new railroad line into Howell&#x27;s Crossing, a village named for his grandfather. There, Howell humorously suggested that the community be called &quot;Duluth&quot; instead, and townspeople agreed.

Proctor Knott is sometimes credited with characterizing Duluth as the &quot;zenith city of the unsalted seas,&quot; but the honor for that coinage belongs to journalist Thomas Preston Foster, who spoke at a Fourth of July picnic in 1868.
===20th century===

During the 20th century, the Port of Duluth was, for a time, the busiest port in the United States, surpassing even New York City in gross tonnage. Lake freighters carried iron ore through the Great Lakes to processing plants in Illinois and Ohio. Ten newspapers, six banks, and an 11-story skyscraper, the Torrey Building, were founded and built. As of 1905, Duluth was said to be home to the most millionaires per capita in the United States.

In 1907, U.S. Steel announced that it would build a $5 million plant in the area. Although steel production did not begin until 1915, predictions held that Duluth&#x27;s population would rise to 200,000–300,000. Along with the Duluth Works steel plant, U.S. Steel developed Morgan Park as a company town for steel workers. It is now a city neighborhood within Duluth.

The Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company was founded in 1908 and later became a major manufacturer and exporter of wrenches and automotive tools. Duluth&#x27;s huge wholesale Marshall Wells Hardware Company expanded in 1901 by opening branches in Portland, Oregon, and Winnipeg, Manitoba; the company catalog totaled 2,390 pages by 1913. The Duluth Showcase Company, which later became the Duluth Refrigerator Company and then the Coolerator Company, was established in 1908. The Universal Atlas Cement Company, which made cement from the slag byproduct of the steel plant, began operations in 1917.

====Immigration====
Because of its numerous jobs in mining and industry, the city was a destination for large waves of immigrants from Europe during the early 20th century. It became the center of one of the largest Finnish communities in the world outside Finland. For decades, a Finnish-language daily newspaper, &quot;Päivälehti,&quot; was published in the city, named after the former Grand Duchy of Finland&#x27;s pro-independence liberal paper. The Finnish community of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) members published the widely read labor newspaper &quot;Industrialisti.&quot; From 1907 to 1941, the Finnish Socialist Federation and then the IWW operated Work People&#x27;s College, an educational institution that taught classes from a working-class, socialist perspective. Immigrants from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, England, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia also settled in Duluth. At one time, Duluth was home to several historic immigrant neighborhoods, including Little Italy. Today, people of Scandinavian descent constitute a strong plurality of Duluth&#x27;s population, accounting for more than a third of the residents identifying European ancestry.

====Duluth lynchings====
In September 1918, a group calling itself the Knights of Liberty dragged Finnish immigrant Olli Kinkkonen from his boarding house, tarred and feathered him, and lynched him. Kinkkonen had not wanted to fight in World War I and instead planned to return to Finland. His body was found two weeks later hanging in a tree in Duluth&#x27;s Lester Park.

Another lynching in Duluth occurred on June 15, 1920, when three innocent black male circus workers—Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson, and Isaac McGhie—were attacked by a white mob and hanged after purportedly raping a teenage white girl. The Duluth lynchings took place on First Street and Second Avenue East. In 1970, journalist Michael Fedo wrote &quot;The Lynchings in Duluth&quot;, which began to raise awareness of the event. Members of many different communities then began to come together for reflection and education.

The men&#x27;s unmarked graves were soon found. In 1991, gravestones were erected with funding from a local church. Vigils were held at the intersection where the men were lynched. In 2000, a grassroots committee was formed and began to offer speakers to groups and schools. It decided to commemorate the event with a memorial; the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which includes a corner wall and plaza, was dedicated in 2003. It includes three -tall bronze statues of the three men. The CJMM Committee continues to work for racial justice through educational outreach, community forums, and scholarships for youth.

====1918 Cloquet Fire====
In 1918, the Cloquet Fire (named for the nearby city of Cloquet) burned across Carlton and St. Louis Counties, destroying dozens of communities in the Duluth area. The fire was the worst natural disaster in Minnesota history in terms of the number of lives lost in a single day. Many people died on the rural roads surrounding the Duluth area, and historical accounts tell of victims dying while trying to outrun the fire. The &quot;News Tribune&quot; reported: &quot;It is estimated that 100 families were rendered homeless by Saturday&#x27;s fire in the territory known as the Woodland District... In most cases, families which lost their homes also lost most or all of their furniture and personal belongings, the limited time and transportation facilities affording little opportunity for saving anything but human life.&quot; The National Guard unit based in Duluth was mobilized in a heroic effort to battle the fire and assist victims, but its troops were overwhelmed by the enormity of the fire.

Retired &quot;Duluth News Tribune&quot; columnist and journalist Jim Heffernan wrote that his mother &quot;recalled an overnight vigil watching out the window of their small home on lower Piedmont Avenue with her father, her younger sisters having gone to sleep, ready to be evacuated to the waterfront should the need arise. The fire never made it that far down the hill, but devastated what is now Piedmont Heights, and, of course, a widespread area of Northeastern Minnesota.&quot; In the fire&#x27;s aftermath, tens of thousands of people were left injured or homeless; many of the refugees fled into the city for aid and shelter.

====Continued growth====
For the first half of the 20th century, Duluth was an industrial port boom town dominated by its several grain elevators, a cement plant, a nail mill, wire mills, and the Duluth Works plant. Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city&#x27;s economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.

The Aerial Lift Bridge (earlier known as the &quot;Aerial Bridge&quot; or &quot;Aerial Ferry Bridge&quot;) was built in 1905 and was known at that time as the United States&#x27; first transporter bridge. Only one other like it was ever constructed in the country. In 1929–30, the span was converted to a vertical-lift bridge, which was also rather uncommon. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

In 1916, after Europe entered World War I, a shipyard was constructed on the St. Louis River. A new workers&#x27; neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during World War II as Duluth&#x27;s large harbor and the area&#x27;s vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and submarine chasers (usually called &quot;sub-chasers&quot;) were built at the Riverside shipyard. Duluth&#x27;s population continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.

====Economic decline====

Economic decline began in the 1950s when high-grade iron ore ran out on the Iron Range north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city&#x27;s economy. Low-grade ore (taconite) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.

In the 1970s, the United States experienced a steel crisis and a recession in the global steel market. Like many American cities, Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, U.S. Steel closed its Duluth Works plant—a blow to the city&#x27;s economy with effects including the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including shipbuilding and heavy machinery. By the decade&#x27;s end, unemployment rates hit 15%. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth&#x27;s West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.

During the 1980s, plans were underway to extend Interstate 35 through Duluth and up the North Shore, bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city&#x27;s access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered. The Minnesota Department of Transportation then agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels, which allowed preservation of Fitger&#x27;s Brewery, Sir Ben&#x27;s Tavern, Leif Erikson Park, and Duluth&#x27;s Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city&#x27;s Lakewalk was built.

===21st-century development===
With the decline of the city&#x27;s industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to tourism. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick, and skywalks and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area&#x27;s unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into cafés, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new Canal Park as a tourism-oriented district. Duluth&#x27;s population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.

In the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to the tourist industry&#x27;s expansion. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.

A group of like-minded businesses in Lincoln Park, an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have been rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014, at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred, and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios. Due to the neighborhood&#x27;s revitalization, many developers are also investing in housing projects in anticipation of further growth.

====Waterfront reclamation efforts====
Duluth&#x27;s prominence as a port city gave it an economic advantage in its early years, but as various industries began to wane, new efforts to reclaim areas of the waterfront for public use emerged. Notable among them is the reclamation of the St. Louis River corridor, which runs along the edge of the city&#x27;s western neighborhoods. Many of these sites, filled with legacy pollutants due to previous industrial use, have been or are in the process of being restored by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with several developments, such as Pier B Resort and Hotel, demonstrating the revitalization opportunity of these former industrial spaces.

Other efforts to reclaim waterfront space in Duluth have been led by the Duluth Waterfront Collective. One notable example includes the Highway 61 Revisited concept, which seeks to reimagine the I-35 corridor as it runs through the city&#x27;s downtown. The group&#x27;s efforts have been met with interest, with the city council voting to explore options for the corridor in 2021.

While the acreage of land utilizing the waterway for port-related purposes has shifted in recent years, the goods being shipped through the Duluth–Superior port have shifted to reflect a changing economy. In recent decades, declines in the shipment of coal and iron ore have been met by increases in the shipment of wind turbine components and multimodal shipping containers.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is Minnesota&#x27;s second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by Hibbing. Duluth&#x27;s canal connects Lake Superior to the Duluth–Superior harbor and the Saint Louis River. It is spanned by the Aerial Lift Bridge, which connects Canal Park with Minnesota Point (or &quot;Park Point&quot;). Minnesota Point is about long and, when included with adjacent Wisconsin Point, which extends from the city of Superior, Wisconsin, is the largest freshwater baymouth bar in the world at a total of .
Duluth&#x27;s topography is dominated by a steep hillside that climbs from Lake Superior to high inland elevations. Duluth has been called &quot;the San Francisco of the Midwest&quot;, alluding to San Francisco&#x27;s similar water-to-hilltop topography. This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an inclined railroad, the 7th Avenue West Incline Railway, that, like San Francisco&#x27;s cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth&#x27;s two airports. The weather station at the lakeside Sky Harbor Airport on Minnesota Point has an elevation of , while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is higher at .
Even as the city has grown, its populace has tended to hug Lake Superior&#x27;s shoreline, making Duluth a primarily southwest–northeast city. The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as Piedmont Heights and Bayview Heights, are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. Skyline Parkway is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the Gary–New Duluth neighborhood near the western end of the city to the Lester Park neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth&#x27;s entire length and affords views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.

A developing part of the city is the Miller Hill Mall area, as well as the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strips &quot;over the hill&quot; along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009–10 road reconstruction project in Duluth&#x27;s Miller Hill area improved movement through the U.S. Highway 53 corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways. A new international airport terminal was completed in 2013 as part of the federal government&#x27;s Stimulus Reconstruction Program.

===Geological history===
The geology of Duluth demonstrates the Midcontinent Rift, formed as the North American continent began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. As the Earth&#x27;s crust thinned, magma rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a -thick sill, primarily of gabbro, which is known as the Duluth Complex.

The creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of continental glaciers that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the sandstone that filled the axis of the rift valley but encountered more resistance from the igneous rocks forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake as high as above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, Glacial Lake Duluth. The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time, a large number of quarries produced the stone, after which it was sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior brownstone; such stone was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.

===Climate===


Duluth has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior. Winters are long, snowy, and very cold, normally seeing maximum temperatures remaining at or below for 100 days (the second-most of any city in the contiguous US behind International Falls), falling to or below on 38 nights, and bringing consistent snow cover from late November to early April. Winter storms that pass south or east of Duluth can often set up easterly or northeasterly flow, leading to occasional upslope lake-effect snow events that bring or more of snow to the city while areas inland receive considerably less. The average annual snowfall is . The lake steams in the winter when moist lake-warmed air at the surface rises and cools, losing some of its moisture-carrying capacity.

Using data on the minimum monthly temperature between 1981 and 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) developed a Comparative Climatic Data report. With a minimum average monthly low temperature of and a maximum average monthly low temperature of , Duluth was found to be the fifth-coldest city in the United States.

Summers are warm, although nights are generally cool, with daytime temperatures averaging in July, with that figure being a few degrees warmer inland. Temperatures reach or exceed on average, only two days per year, while the city has officially seen temperatures on only three days, all during the July 1936 heat wave from the Dust Bowl years. The phrase &quot;cooler by the lake&quot; can be heard often in weather forecasts during the summer, especially on days when an easterly wind is expected. Great local variations are also common because of the rapid change in elevation between the nearly hilltop and shoreside. Often, this variation manifests itself as snow in higher elevations, whereas rain falls near Lake Superior.

The record low temperature in Duluth is , set on January 2, 1885. The record high temperature is , set on July 13, 1936. On average, the first freezing temperature occurs on September 30 and the last on May 14, although a freezing temperature has occurred in August. The average window for measurable (≥) snowfall is October 22 through April 26.


===2012 flooding===
From June 19–20, 2012, Duluth suffered the worst flood in its history, caused by of rain throughout the course of 30 hours. Combined with its rocky sediments, hard soil, and 43 streams and creeks, the city could not handle the massive rainfall. Mayor Don Ness declared a state of emergency, asking for national assistance. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton declared a state of emergency, sending the National Guard and the Red Cross to assist in the relief efforts. Several sinkholes opened throughout the city, causing massive property damage. Several feet of standing water accumulated in many city alleys and parking lots. Streets were turned into rapids, and many roads split apart due to the heavy flow of water. A portion of West Skyline Parkway tumbled down the hill, isolating a neighborhood. The Saint Louis River, in Duluth&#x27;s Fond du Lac neighborhood, flooded Highway 23, isolating that neighborhood as well and damaging roadways and bridges.

The Lake Superior Zoo flooded in the early hours of June 20; 11 barnyard animals drowned, as did a turkey vulture, a raven, and a snowy owl. The rising waters enabled a polar bear to escape her exhibit, though she was quickly found on zoo grounds, tranquilized, and moved to safety. Two harbor seals escaped the zoo grounds but were later found on Grand Avenue. All three animals were moved to Como Park Zoo in Saint Paul for a temporary but indeterminate amount of time. The polar bear was transferred to the Kansas City Zoo in 2012 as part of the American Zoological Association&#x27;s (AZA) Species Survival Program breeding recommendation.

===2012 tornado===
Tornadoes are uncommon in Duluth, considering its latitude and location next to the climate-moderating Lake Superior. However, on August 9, 2012, at around 11:00 am, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar&#x27;s shoreline, making it a true tornado. It quickly dissipated but soon touched down again on Superior&#x27;s Barker&#x27;s Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage; the tornado was categorized as an EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. At the time, the National Weather Service reported that it was Duluth&#x27;s first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a &quot;miniature tornado&quot; that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The &quot;News Tribune&quot; reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935:Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds [and] a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.

==Economy==
Duluth is the major regional center for health care, higher education, retail, and business services not only of its own immediate area but also of a larger area encompassing northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years, it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota, as well as of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta. The Port of Duluth handles an average of 35 million short tons of cargo and nearly 900 vessel visits each year. 90 percent of the port&#x27;s vessels are &quot;Lakers&quot;, ships that ship goods exclusively among the upper four Great Lakes and are too large to transit the Welland Canal. The rest are &quot;Salties&quot;, ships that can traverse the seaway all the way from the Atlantic Ocean.

The Twin Ports has attracted several new engineering firms, including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, Enbridge, and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields including Loll Designs and Epicurean, two sister companies that make eco-friendly furniture and kitchen utensils respectively, and microbrewery Bent Paddle. Women&#x27;s clothing retail chain Maurices is also headquartered in Duluth, as are luggage manufacturers and suppliers Duluth Pack and Frost River. In 1989, the workwear and accessories brand Duluth Trading Company was founded on a barge in the city&#x27;s shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000. Supermarket chain Super One Foods is also based in the Twin Ports, with its headquarters in neighboring Hermantown.

Duluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA&#x27;s Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the University of Minnesota Duluth. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth&#x27;s economy. A short list of these businesses includes ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and Ecolab.

The city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic North Shore via Highway 61 and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota&#x27;s far north, including the Superior National Forest, Voyageurs National Park, Lake Vermilion, and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Tourists also may drive on the North Shore Scenic Drive to Gooseberry Falls State Park, Baptism Falls (Minnesota&#x27;s largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of Palisade Head, Isle Royale National Park (reached via ferry), Grand Portage National Monument in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada–US border). Thunder Bay, Ontario, can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.

In 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city. Mayor Don Ness called it &quot;the single most important volunteer effort in our city&#x27;s history&quot;. After reforming and restructuring the benefits and a court case that went all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, in 2013 the liability stood at an estimated $191 million. In 2014, Ness announced &quot;a full solution for the retiree health care issue that once threatened to bankrupt our city&quot;.

===Top employers===
According to the city&#x27;s 2023 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, Duluth&#x27;s 10 largest employers are:

===Aviation===
Several multinational aviation corporations operate near Duluth. Since 1994, the city has been home to the headquarters and main manufacturing facilities of Cirrus Aircraft, a company with nearly 1,600 Duluth employees (as of 2023) building the world&#x27;s best-selling general aviation aircraft, the SR22, and the world&#x27;s first single-engine personal jet, the Vision SF50. James Fallows, national correspondent for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, said that Cirrus&#x27; rapid growth in Duluth over the years &quot;was a major, major factor in the town&#x27;s modern emergence&quot;. Former mayor Gary Doty called the arrival of Cirrus in the mid-1990s a &quot;crucial turning point&quot; for Duluth and said it was &quot;the catalyst for more positive attitudes about the city... If that hadn&#x27;t happened, then we might really have been in a tailspin.&quot; As of 2024, the company is Duluth&#x27;s largest manufacturer and third-largest employer. In January 2012, another aircraft manufacturer, Kestrel Aircraft, maker of the K-350 turboprop plane and later known as ONE Aviation, moved to the Twin Ports. In October of that year, AAR Corp opened an aircraft repair and maintenance facility at the Duluth airport. Both companies ceased operations in the region during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In January 2013, the Duluth International Airport opened a new terminal, now named the U.S. Representative James L. Oberstar Terminal after the late Jim Oberstar.

The Air National Guard&#x27;s 148th Fighter Wing is at the Duluth Air National Guard Base and is the city&#x27;s sixth-largest employer as of 2022. It is one of a handful of National Guard units with an active association which, in the 148th&#x27;s case, means having the capability to provide training for Air Force pilots. The 179th Fighter Squadron is a unit of the 148th.

Minnesota&#x27;s largest airshow, the Duluth Air &amp; Aviation Expo, takes place each year on the grounds of Duluth International Airport.

==Arts and culture==
Duluth&#x27;s museums include the Duluth Children&#x27;s Museum in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Founded in 1930, it is the fifth-oldest of its kind in the nation. It features interactive exhibits, educational programs, and opportunities for creative play designed for children, their families and caregivers, and school field trips. The museum also curates an artifact collection of over 25,000 objects drawn from the lives and cultures of people who have resided in the region, particularly American Indians and immigrants. Other museums include the Tweed Museum of Art at the University of Minnesota Duluth and the Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum.

The Historic Old Central High School, a city landmark built in 1892, housed a museum dedicated to the school&#x27;s history until its sale to developers in 2022. The old school features a clock tower with chimes patterned after Big Ben in London; the clock faces are each in diameter, overlooking the Duluth harbor. It is listed with the National Register of Historic Places, which says, &quot;Old Central is a very fine example of that traditionally rich architectural style known as Romanesque and is certainly the most outstanding structure of its kind to be found in northern Minnesota.&quot;

The premier community art center is the Duluth Art Institute, with galleries, a fiber studio, and a darkroom in the Depot downtown, as well as ceramic and multi-purpose studios in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Several art galleries are also downtown and in Canal Park. The Duluth Public Library has three locations. Duluth is home to a professional ballet company, the Minnesota Ballet. It shares a symphony orchestra—the Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra—with Superior, Wisconsin. In the summer, free concerts are held in Chester Park, where local musicians play for crowds. The Bayfront Blues Festival is held in early August.

Duluth is home to several theater companies, including The Duluth Playhouse, one of the country&#x27;s oldest operating community theaters. Founded in 1914, the Playhouse&#x27;s main offices and two of its theaters are housed in the Depot Building on Michigan Street. The Playhouse has a comprehensive theatrical season on multiple stages, including Duluth&#x27;s NorShor Theatre. It also has a renowned education program.

The NorShor Theatre is a historic movie palace on Superior Street that was restored for use as a performance venue. The century-old venue is generally considered a local landmark. After 19 months of construction and renovations, it opened in 2018 with a 600-seat, stadium-style, balconied, live-performance auditorium; a bar; and a lounge.

Since 2004, Duluth has celebrated Gay Pride with a parade on Labor Day weekend. Since 1998, the city has held the Homegrown Music Festival in the first week of May; it features over 170 local musical acts performing across the city. The Junior Achievement High School ROCKS–Battle of the Bands showcases middle-school and high-school bands from central Minnesota to the Canada–U.S. border and northern Wisconsin at the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center (DECC) in mid-April. Duluth also hosts the Northeastern Minnesota Book Awards, honoring books about the region.

===Attractions===
Canal Park is a district with recreation activities, restaurants, cafés, hotels, and shops, especially those dealing in antiques. Formerly a warehouse district, the area converted to a recreation-oriented district following the decline in manufacturing in the 1980s. A walking path offers views of Park Point&#x27;s sand dunes and swimming beaches and the lighthouse pier. The path passes under the Aerial Lift Bridge, a vertical lift bridge spanning the Duluth Ship Canal into Duluth&#x27;s harbor. It was originally an exceedingly rare aerial transfer bridge—a bridge that slides a basketlike &quot;gondola&quot; back and forth to transfer people and vehicles from one side to the other. The wreck of the &quot;Thomas Wilson&quot;, a classic early-20th-century whaleback ore boat, lies underwater less than outside the Duluth harbor ship canal.

The Duluth Lakewalk, expanded and improved beginning in the 1980s, is a seven-mile walking/biking path that begins in Canal Park and follows the lakeshore, crossing through Leif Erikson Park and the Duluth Rose Garden, and ending at the Bayfront Festival Park, an area with a covered pavilion where festivals, concerts, and other events are held.

Duluth is the starting point for the North Shore of Lake Superior scenic route that runs from Duluth, at the southwestern end of the lake, to Thunder Bay and Nipigon in the north and Sault Ste. Marie in the east. The route was already a popular tourist destination after 1855 when the Great Lakes lock system first allowed steamboats onto the lake and eastern tourists began to travel onto Lake Superior for recreational purposes. By the mid-1870s, many excursion boats, coastal steamers, and ferries ran along the North Shore, primarily out of Duluth and Thunder Bay. After docking in Duluth, tourists often canoed or were ferried up the North Shore, staying in hunting and fishing camps and later hotels and small cabins.

====Great Lakes Aquarium====
The Great Lakes Aquarium is in the Duluth Waterfront Park. A freshwater aquarium, it features animals and habitats found in the Great Lakes Basin and other freshwater ecosystems such as the Amazon River. The aquarium houses 205 different species of fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals. It is one of the few aquariums in the United States to focus on freshwater exhibits.

====Lake Superior Maritime Museum and Visitor Center====
The Great Lakes Maritime Museum and Visitor Center contains historical exhibits, maritime artifacts, and a recreation of a ship&#x27;s pilot house, cabins, and staterooms with life-size mannequins that speak to the visitors. In the pilot house, children can pretend to command the ship using a ship&#x27;s steering wheel and other instruments. The exhibits contain artifacts from the many sunken ships in the Duluth harbor; one exhibit tells the story of the , which sank in a November gale after departing from the Duluth Superior port. There is also a small movie theater and a viewing room where visitors can watch the ships arriving in the harbor and find arrival times of the ships that will arrive throughout the day.

====William A. Irvin Ship Museum====
After transporting coal and iron in the Great Lakes for more than 40 years, the was docked in Duluth and serves as a preserved example of the shipping history of the Great Lakes. As the flagship of U.S. Steel&#x27;s Great Lakes Fleet, she provided what has been called the &quot;comfort and elegance to dignitaries and guests who traveled the Lakes with her&quot; while hauling materials from Two Harbors and Duluth to U.S. Steel&#x27;s respective mills on Lake Michigan in Ohio and on Lake Erie in Indiana.

====Lake Superior Railroad Museum====

The Lake Superior Railroad Museum is in the Duluth Union Depot. It has seven steam, 14 diesel, and two electric locomotives, as well as over 40 other pieces of rolling stock. The collection includes the William Crooks, the first locomotive to operate in the state of Minnesota, and the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway Number 227, a Yellowstone locomotive that was among the largest steam engines ever. Only 18 Yellowstones were ever built; Duluth exhibits one of the three that remain.

====North Shore Scenic Railroad====
The North Shore Scenic Railroad is a heritage railroad that operates between Duluth and Two Harbors, Minnesota. It is owned by the Lake Superior Railroad Museum and offers several different types of passenger excursion trains between May 28 and October 15 each year. The railroad was started in 1990, using the Lakefront Line once owned by the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway.

====Fitger&#x27;s Brewery====
The original brewery was built in 1857 on a stream that came to be known as Brewery Creek; it was purchased by Michael Fink in 1881 and moved downstream to its present location on Superior Street. Fink&#x27;s Lake Superior Brewery hired a new brewmaster, August Fitger, a graduate of one of Germany&#x27;s premier brewing schools, and the brewery was renamed A. Fitger &amp; Co. / Lake Superior Brewery. The brewery then became successful and stayed in operation even through Prohibition, but closed in 1972 after 115 years of operation, making it Duluth&#x27;s oldest business. The complex reopened in 1984 and contains a craft brewery, several restaurants, hotels, shops, and a museum. Fitger&#x27;s Brewery Complex is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

====Glensheen Mansion====
The Glensheen Historic Estate, on the shore of Lake Superior, was built as the family home for wealthy businessman Chester Adgate Congdon. Glensheen sits on of lakefront property, has 38 rooms, and is built in the Jacobean architectural tradition, inspired by the Beaux-Arts styles of the era. The building was designed by Minnesota architect Clarence H. Johnston Sr., with interiors designed by William French. The formal terraced garden and English-style landscape was designed by the Charles Wellford Leavitt firm of New York. Construction began in 1905 at a cost of $854,000 (about $ in dollars) and was completed in 1908. Aside from its architectural significance, Glensheen is noteworthy for the murders of Elisabeth Congdon and her nurse on June 27, 1977. The mansion is open to tours year-round.

====Lake Superior Zoo====
The 16-acre Lake Superior Zoo offers year-round recreational activities and features animals from around the world, including Amur tigers, snow leopards, African lions, brown bears, kangaroos, gray wolves, and a variety of birds, reptiles, primates and barnyard animals. The zoo offers learning programs and regularly features special events.

====Enger Tower====
Enger Tower is an , five-story blue stone observation tower atop Enger Hill in Duluth. The tower provides panoramic views of the Twin Ports from lookouts accessible by stairs, and a green beacon is mounted atop the tower.

====Hawk Ridge fall raptor count====
Duluth is in the path of many avian flyways and migratory birds that pass over the area in great numbers. Hawk Ridge, on Skyline Parkway, is ideal for viewing migratory raptors. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Hawk Ridge has attracted visitors from all 50 states and 40 countries, from Labor Day through October. Volunteers and licensed bird banders capture raptors in nets and band them while large crowds gather to observe the capture and release.

====Gichi-Ode&#x27; Akiing====
Just off the Lakewalk is a park named Gichi-Ode&#x27; Akiing; the name is Ojibwe for &quot;a grand heart place&quot;. The Duluth City Council approved the name change from Lake Place Park in 2018. A memorial to Kechewaishke, also known as Chief Buffalo, honors his symbolic petition carried to president Millard Fillmore in 1849. Kechewaishke signed the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe a year before his death, with the provision that of land at the corner of Lake Superior be given to his adopted son Benjamin G. Armstrong. Known as the Buffalo Tract, Armstrong&#x27;s land comprised part of today&#x27;s downtown Duluth.

====John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon====

The John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon, named for winter mail carrier John Beargrease, is an annual sled dog race that runs from Duluth to Grand Portage. Beargrease and his brothers were among the first to carry mail between Two Harbors and Grand Marais, going by dogsled, boat, and horse for almost 20 years before the towns were connected by road. Competitors can choose between two distances: a round trip between Duluth and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area—or a course from Duluth to Tofte. The race begins at Billy&#x27;s Bar in northeastern Duluth. Run every January since 1980, it is regarded as a training ground for Alaska&#x27;s larger and more elite Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

====Magic Smelt Parade====
In May, Duluthians celebrate the annual smelt run with the Magic Smelt Parade along the city&#x27;s lakewalk. It is a family-oriented affair conducted in the manner of a New Orleans Second Line Parade, with a &quot;Main Line&quot; led by a small brass band followed by the &quot;second liners&quot; who walk and dance behind the band. The Smelt Parade&#x27;s second liners wear silver hats, capes, and other costumes related to smelt. A Smelt King and Smelt Queens also take part in the parade.

====Grandma&#x27;s Marathon====

Since 1977, Duluth has hosted Grandma&#x27;s Marathon, a race held annually in June. Named after its original sponsor, Grandma&#x27;s Restaurant, it draws runners from all over the world. The course starts just outside Two Harbors, Minnesota, runs down Old Highway 61 (the former route of Highway 61 along the North Shore of Lake Superior), and finishes in one of Duluth&#x27;s tourism neighborhoods, Canal Park. The same route is also taken during the North Shore Inline Marathon, held in September, which also draws racers from all over the world.

====Christmas City of the North Parade====
Each year in November, the Christmas City of the North Parade takes place in Duluth. The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich—who owned the former WDSM-TV at the time, now KBJR-TV—came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow, and frigid cold. Even in years when instruments were too cold to produce music, the bands became choirs to provide music instead. Recorded by Merv Griffin in 1962, the &quot;Christmas City&quot; song is the parade&#x27;s signature sound. According to Rich&#x27;s grandson, the song was written by a local resident, and his grandfather asked his friend Griffin—at that time not the well-known TV personality he became—to sing the song and put it to music.

====Bentleyville Tour of Lights====
Since 2009, the Bentleyville Tour of Lights decorates the Bayfront Festival Park during November and December with over 5,000,000 lights. A free lighting display, it has been called the United States&#x27; &quot;largest display of Christmas lights&quot; that patrons can walk through.

==Sports==

===Professional sports history===
====Football====

Duluth fielded a National Football League team called the Kelleys (officially the Kelley Duluths after the Kelley-Duluth Hardware Store) from 1923 to 1925. It also fielded the Eskimos (officially Ernie Nevers&#x27; Eskimos after the early NFL great, their star player) from 1926 to 1927. The Eskimos were then sold and became the Orange Tornadoes (Orange, New Jersey). This bit of history became the basis for the 2008 George Clooney/Renée Zellweger movie, &quot;Leatherheads&quot;.

====Baseball====
The Duluth–Superior Dukes of the Northern League Independent Professional Baseball played in West Duluth&#x27;s Wade Stadium from the league&#x27;s inception in 1993 until 2002 when the team moved to Kansas City, Kansas, after which it became the Kansas City T-Bones. The Dukes were Northern League champions in 1997. An earlier Northern League, based in the Midwest, was also in operation off and on from 1902 to 1971, the longest stint being 1932–1971. The Dukes were also a farm team for the Detroit Tigers from 1960 to 1964 and several other teams in later years before the Northern League folded in 1971. The Dukes produced notable players such as Denny McLain, Bill Freehan, Gates Brown, Ray Oyler, Jim Northrup, Mickey Stanley, John Hiller, and Willie Horton, all of whom were members of the 1968 world champion Detroit Tigers.

====Boxing====
Duluth is also home to Horton&#x27;s Gym, the home gym of professional boxers Zach &quot;Jungle Boy&quot; Walters and Andy Kolle, as well as a number of other professional prizefighters. Horton&#x27;s Gym was run by Chuck Horton from 1994 to 2011. During that time, Horton trained some of the most recognized professional and amateur boxers in Minnesota such as Walters, Kolle, RJ Lasse, Gary Eyer and Wayne Putnam. In 2011, Horton turned the gym over to Zach Walters so that Horton could concentrate solely on training professional boxers; Walters then changed the gym&#x27;s name to Jungle Boy Boxing Gym. Horton is currently the trainer of Al Sands; Sands won the North American Boxing Association&#x27;s U.S. Cruiserweight title in April 2014.

==Parks and recreation==
Duluth has numerous parks, including six parks on Lake Superior: Leif Erikson Park, which includes a lakeside rose garden; Brighton Beach Park; Canal Park on Park Point; the Lakewalk (connecting Canal Park and Leif Erikson Park via the lakeshore); and Lafayette Park on Park Point. The Park Point Recreation Area near the end of Park Point has a community center, numerous pavilions, a swimming beach, sand volleyball court, picnic tables and grills, and a boat launch. Park Point Pine Forest, at the tip of Park Point, is popular for bird-watching in the spring and fall when shorebirds use the area as a resting point during their migration. A shipping schedule of ships entering the harbor is available, as well as five live cams including a cam of the canal, the lift bridge, and the beach.
Other parks include historic Lester Park, one of Duluth&#x27;s most popular parks. Just upstream from where Amity Creek joins the Lester River, a large, deep pool has formed that attracts cliff diving. Amity Creek is the site of The Seven Bridges Road, a four-mile section of Skyline Parkway where it follows Amity Creek from the top of the bluffs down to Lake Superior. The 400-foot drop has resulted in a long cascade of waterfalls.

Duluth&#x27;s other parks include Congdon Park, Hartley Park, Chester Park, Bayfront Festival Park, Cascade Park, Enger Park, Lincoln Park, Brewer Park, Fairmount Park, Indian Point Park, Magney–Snively Park, and Fond du Lac Park, as well as some small neighborhood parks and athletic fields. Lester Park, Congdon Park, Hartley Park, and Chester Park have trail systems, and three of these parks—all but Hartley—also have waterfalls, as does Lincoln Park. Hartley Park also has a nature center. Lester Park and Enger Park have public golf courses. Fairmount Park has the Lake Superior Zoo. Jay Cooke State Park is a Minnesota state park about southwest of Duluth. The park is along the Saint Louis River and is one of Minnesota&#x27;s 10 most visited state parks.

===Leif Erikson Park===

For many years, the &quot;Leif Erikson&quot;, a Viking ship that was built in Norway by local boat builders to replicate the type of ship sailed by Leif Erikson who arrived in North America around 997 A.D. was on display in the Leif Erikson park. The vessel is long, has a beam and draws of water. The Dragon&#x27;s Head and Tail are considered by architects to be masterpieces. The ship was invited to Duluth by Norwegian-American immigrant and businessman H.H. Borgen. When the crew landed in Duluth on June 23, 1927, they had traveled a distance of , the greatest distance for a ship of its size in modern history. Hundreds of people lined the dock to greet the ship as it sailed into the Duluth harbor.

Duluthian Emil Olson purchased the ship soon after the voyage and donated the &quot;Leif Erikson&quot; to the City of Duluth. The ship was placed on display in Duluth&#x27;s Lake Park, which was later named Leif Erikson Park.

The &quot;Leif Erikson&quot; steadily deteriorated after years of neglect and vandalism. By 1980, it was in such poor condition that it was even considered that the ship be burned in the traditional Viking manner of putting a ship to rest. This suggestion inspired Emil Olson&#x27;s grandson, Will Borg, to bring volunteers together and begin fundraising efforts to restore the ship. Through donations, festivals, and other endeavors, the group raised $100,000. Boatbuilders began the restoration in 1991. Restoration went slowly with starts and stops due to lack of funding. In 2015, it was announced that restoration had been completed and plans were in place to build a glass structure to house the ship, but as of 2022, the ship remains in storage.

Located within Leif Erikson Park and overlooking Lake Superior, the Duluth Rose Garden is a formal English style garden with more than 3,000 rose bushes and 12,000 non-rose plantings, including day lilies, evergreen shrubs, mixed perennials, and an herb garden. The rose varieties are labeled, and there are signs that give information on the rose&#x27;s history and culture. The six-acre garden grows in soil resting over a highway tunnel that encloses the termination point of the freeway entering Duluth. Brick walkways connect all of the beds, and there are many benches in the garden that resemble stone sofas. There is an antique horse fountain and a marble gazebo. The garden is a popular place for summer outdoor weddings.

In August 1956, a bronze statue of Leif Erikson by John Karl Daniels was added to the park. The statue was donated by the Norwegian American League and members of the community.

===Recreation===
Duluth offers numerous outdoor activities including fishing, hiking, skiing, sailing, canoeing, kayaking, surfing, trail running, and mountain biking. In addition to the two public golf courses at Lester and Enger Park, golfers can play at the Northland Country Club and the Ridgeview Country Club. Duluth has five public tennis courts and 63 private tennis club courts. The city has many indoor and outdoor ice rinks, including curling facilities.

The University of Minnesota Duluth Recreational Sport Outdoor Program offers classes in kayak, stand-up paddleboarding, and canoe whitewater river running, and holds the Annual St. Louis River Whitewater Rendezvous Slalom &amp; Sprint Races in July. The program also provides sea kayaking and rock climbing lessons for individuals and families.

====Superior Hiking and Piedmont Mountain Biking trails====
Duluth hosts a segment of the Superior Hiking Trail, which is also part of the North Country National Scenic Trail—the nation&#x27;s longest hiking trail. This trail segment passes through Jay Cooke State Park, Ely Peak, Bardon Peak, the Magney–Snively old growth forest, Spirit Mountain, Enger Park, Point of Rocks, the Lakewalk, Chester Park, UMD&#x27;s Bagley nature trails, and Hartley Park. It features views of the Saint Louis River, the Twin Ports, the Aerial Bridge, and Lake Superior.

The hilly, Piedmont mountain biking trail crosses numerous bridges and offers scenic views of Duluth and the bay. The trail is recommended for both beginner and intermediate riders.

====Skiing====

With a vertical elevation of approximately , Spirit Mountain is Minnesota&#x27;s second-highest ski hill. The park includes jumps ranging from to over , as well as numerous rails, boxes, and other jibs. Spirit Mountain opened an alpine coaster in 2010. In 2011, it announced plans to add a zip line, miniature golf, and snow tubing. In 1995, the mountain completed its first NORBA application; in 2012, work began on downhill mountain bike trails.

The Duluth area also has a large and active Nordic skiing community, with many parks providing excellent Nordic skate skiing and classic cross-country skiing opportunities.

Chester Bowl, off Skyline Parkway in Chester Park, is a city-owned park with a chairlift; it has the lowest daily lift ticket prices in the nation, at $6. For decades, Chester Bowl was also known for its ski jumps; they were removed due to safety concerns in 2015.

====Sailing and rowing====
Duluth has both a yacht and rowing club. Since 1969, the Trans Superior Race has run every other year from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to Duluth. At a distance of almost , it is said to be &quot;the world&#x27;s longest known freshwater sailboat race&quot;.

Duluth has been holding the Tall Ships festivals since 2008. The events are held every three years, and estimates of 250,000 have crowded the shoreline during each event to watch the vintage ships enter the harbor.

====Surfing====
Surfing is a popular Duluth recreation on Lake Superior shores when conditions are right for producing high waves. UMD offers a surfing course as part of its Recreational Sports Outdoor Program. The instructors say that when the wind blows from the northeast, &quot;Duluth becomes a legitimate surf town.&quot; They list Park Point, Lester River, and Stoney Point as &quot;local hot spots&quot;.

A documentary film about Duluth&#x27;s surfing community was scheduled to premiere in 2022.

====Hunting for agates====
The Minnesota state gem, the Lake Superior agate, can be found on the shores of Lake Superior, in the streams that run into it, and in gravel pits and road cuts. Duluth&#x27;s Park Point is an excellent area for hunting, as shorelines and beaches are replenished each year because winter ice and storms push new material up on the shores. Books are available in Duluth to help amateur rock hounds learn more about agates and how to locate them.

==Government==
Duluth is in Minnesota&#x27;s 8th congressional district, represented by Republican Pete Stauber. It has a mayor–council form of government. The mayor is Roger Reinert, who took office in 2024 after defeating incumbent Emily Larson. The Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party has controlled the mayor&#x27;s office continuously since 1975. Duluth&#x27;s longest-serving mayor was Samuel F. Snively, serving from 1921 to 1937. He is remembered for his initiatives creating parks and boulevards, such as the Seven Bridges Road and Skyline Parkway. 

The City Administration makes policy proposals to a nine-member City Council. Duluth&#x27;s five representational districts are divided into 36 precincts. Each district elects its own councilor. There are also four at-large councilors, representing the entire city. The City Council elects a president who presides over meetings.

Duluth is the heart of the state&#x27;s 8th legislative district, represented in the Minnesota Senate by Jen McEwen and in the Minnesota House of Representatives by Alicia Kozlowski (District 8B) and Liz Olson (District 8A)—all members of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which has long dominated the city&#x27;s politics.

==Education==
Local colleges and universities include the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD); the UMD campus includes a medical school. The UMD Bulldogs won the Division I National Hockey Championship in 2011, 2018 and 2019. Other schools include The College of St. Scholastica, Lake Superior College, and Duluth Business University. The University of Wisconsin–Superior and Northwood Technical College are in nearby Superior, Wisconsin.

Most public schools are administered by Duluth Public Schools. The schools have open enrollment. ISD 709 (Independent School District number 709) is now undertaking a reconstruction of all area schools under a program called the &quot;Red Plan.&quot; The Red Plan&#x27;s goals are the reconstruction of some older schools (to meet new educational guidelines) and the construction of four new school buildings. The new schools will result in the redistricting of many students. As of 2009, the Red Plan was and is being contested in court by some citizens because of the cost of implementing the plan and because of the choice of construction management contractor.

Several independent and public charter schools also serve Duluth students. The largest is Duluth Edison Charter Schools, a public charter school covering grades K-8. Marshall School, a private college preparatory school founded as Duluth Cathedral in 1904, covers grades 4–12. Duluth&#x27;s Catholic school system, Stella Maris Academy, has four campuses providing Catholic education from early childhood to high school. There are also two Protestant schools, two Montessori schools, and six other charter and private schools.

Due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, Duluth is the location for the Large Lakes Observatory. The Large Lakes Observatory operates the largest university-owned research vessel in the Great Lakes, the R/V Blue Heron. Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997; sailed from Portland, Maine, up the St. Lawrence Seaway, to Duluth; and converted into a limnological research vessel during the winter of 1997–98. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes.

==Infrastructure==

===Public transportation===
The local bus system is run by the Duluth Transit Authority (DTA), which serves Duluth, Hermantown, Proctor, Rice Lake, and Superior, Wisconsin. The DTA runs a system of buses manufactured by Gillig and Proterra, including new hybrids and battery electric busses. Duluth is also served by Skyline Shuttle, with daily service to the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport; Jefferson Lines, with daily service to the Twin Cities; and Indian Trails, with service to Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula.

===Railways===
Duluth was connected to Minneapolis by the &quot;North Star&quot; passenger train from 1978 to 1985. The North Shore Scenic Railroad operated seasonal excursion trains on its line to Two Harbors. The former Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway, now part of the Canadian National Railway, operates taconite-hauling trains in the area. Duluth is also served by the BNSF Railway, the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Union Pacific Railroad.

A proposal to restore service between the Twin Cities and the Twin Ports via the Northern Lights Express was first made in 2000. Detailed plans and environmental assessments have since been completed, but the project has yet to be fully funded.

===Air Transport===
Duluth International Airport serves the city and surrounding region with daily flights to Minneapolis and Chicago. Nearby municipal airports are Duluth Sky Harbor on Minnesota Point and the Richard I. Bong Airport in Superior. Both the Bong Airport and Bong Bridge are named for famed World War II pilot and highest-scoring American World War II air ace Major Richard Ira &quot;Dick&quot; Bong, a native of nearby Poplar, Wisconsin.

===Highways===
The Duluth area marks the northern endpoint of Interstate Highway 35, which stretches south to Laredo, Texas. U.S. Highways that serve the area are U.S. Highway 53, which stretches from La Crosse, Wisconsin, to International Falls, and U.S. Highway 2, which stretches from Everett, Washington, to St. Ignace, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The southwestern part of the city has Thompson Hill, where travelers entering Duluth on I-35 can see most of Duluth, including the Aerial Lift Bridge and the waterfront. There are two freeway connections from Duluth to Superior. U.S. 2 provides a connection into Superior via the Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge; Interstate 535 runs concurrently with U.S. 53 over the John Blatnik Bridge.

Many state highways serve the area. Highway 23 runs diagonally across Minnesota, indirectly connecting Duluth to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Highway 33 provides a western bypass of Duluth connecting Interstate 35, which comes up from the Twin Cities to U.S. 53, which leads to Iron Range cities and International Falls. Highway 61 provides access to Thunder Bay, Ontario, via the North Shore of Lake Superior. Highway 194 provides a spur route into the city of Duluth known as &quot;Central Entrance&quot; and Mesaba Avenue. Wisconsin Highway 13 reaches along Lake Superior&#x27;s South Shore. Wisconsin Highway 35 runs along Wisconsin&#x27;s western border for to its southern terminus at the Wisconsin–Illinois border ( north of East Dubuque). Highway 61 and parts of Highways 2 and 53 are segments of the Lake Superior Circle Tour route that follows Lake Superior through Minnesota, Ontario, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

===Port of Duluth–Superior===
At the western end of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, the Duluth–Superior port is North America&#x27;s largest and farthest-inland freshwater port. The port handles an average of of cargo and over 1,100 visits each year from domestic and international vessels. With of waterfront, it is one of North America&#x27;s leading bulk cargo ports and ranks among the top 20 ports in the U.S. Duluth is a major shipping port for taconite pellets, made from concentrated low-grade iron ore and destined for midwestern and eastern steel mills. The arrival schedule of the ships that pass under the bridge is available, and locals and visitors gather to watch them enter the harbor. Despite their size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze over in winter, interrupting most shipping from January to March.

Two types of ships regularly enter the port: the lakers and the salties. The lakers, which comprise over 90% of the port traffic, are the larger cargo ships built specially to sail the Great Lakes, with the largest ones over 1,000 feet long. They are mostly self-unloaders, with a long boom mounted on the upper deck. Their traffic is limited to the Great Lakes because they are too large to fit through the St. Lawrence Seaway. The salties are smaller ships with a maximum size of 740 feet. They typically have sharply cutaway bows as compared to the lakers&#x27; vertical ones, as well as a series of cranes rising above their decks. They are small enough to navigate the St. Lawrence Seaway. Other than their size, they can also be identified by their color, often blue, red, or green. The lakers are generally black or rust.

===Utilities===
Duluth gets electric power from Duluth-based Minnesota Power, a subsidiary of ALLETE Corporation. Minnesota Power produces energy at generation facilities located throughout northern Minnesota and a generation plant in North Dakota. The latter supplies electricity into the MP system by the Square Butte HVDC line, which ends near the town.

Minnesota Power primarily uses western coal to generate electricity but also has a number of small hydroelectric facilities, the largest of which is the Thomson Dam southwest of Duluth on the Saint Louis River.

In December 2006, Minnesota Power began purchasing all the energy generated from the new 50-MW Oliver Wind I Energy Center built by NextEra Resources near Center, North Dakota. In 2007, Minnesota Power entered into a second 25-year wind power purchase agreement with NextEra. A 48-MW facility was built adjacent to the initial Oliver County wind farm, and new generators began commercial operation in November 2007.

Construction began in 2010 on the 76-MW Bison Wind I Energy Center near New Salem, North Dakota. Bison I represents the first wave of Minnesota Power-constructed wind farms that will be built in south central North Dakota and linked to Minnesota by way of a direct current (DC) transmission line. In 2010, ALLETE finalized an agreement to purchase a 250-kilovolt DC line between Center, North Dakota, and Hermantown, Minnesota (near ALLETE headquarters in Duluth), and phase out a long-term contract to buy coal-generated electricity transmitted over the line.

Because of wind energy demand, Duluth has recently become a port for wind energy parts shipments from overseas and the Midwestern hub for shipments out to various wind energy sites.

Duluth&#x27;s water supply is sourced from Lake Superior and treated at the Lakewood Water Treatment Plant. The plant&#x27;s oldest structure, the Lakewood Pumphouse, was built in 1896 in Romanesque Revival style, replacing older facilities that had been unable to prevent a typhoid epidemic. It was designed by William Patton. A 42-inch original main from 1896, one of two leaving the facility with clean, treated water, is still in use today. The system supplies approximately 100,000 people in Duluth and nearby towns.

Throughout its history, Duluth&#x27;s sewers have overflowed when it rains, causing untreated sewage to flow into Lake Superior and the Saint Louis River. In 2001 alone, the overflow amounted to over . The City of Duluth has recently taken measures to eliminate sewage overflows; in 2013, the improvements were three years ahead of schedule.

===Fire department===
According to a 2013 report, the city of Duluth was protected by 132 paid, professional firefighters of the city of Duluth Fire Department that year. The Duluth Fire Department responded to 12,231 fire and emergency medical calls in 2015.

The Duluth Fire Department operates out of eight fire stations throughout the city, under the command of an Assistant Chief, Squad 251. The department also operates a fire apparatus fleet of six engines, one tower ladder, two quints, one heavy-duty rescue, two light medical response vehicles, and numerous other special, support, and reserve units.

<doc id="63504" wikidata="Q778161" url="?curid=63504" title="Touch of Evil">
<text>Touch of Evil is a 1958 American film noir written and directed by Orson Welles, who also stars. The screenplay was loosely based on Whit Masterson&#x27;s novel &quot;Badge of Evil&quot; (1956). The cast included Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Joseph Calleia, Akim Tamiroff and Marlene Dietrich.

Universal-International commissioned the film adaptation of the novel in April 1956. Albert Zugsmith was selected as producer, who then hired television writer Paul Monash to write the script. Heston was brought on board to star in January 1957 and suggested that Welles direct the project. Welles was hired to direct and star, as well as re-write the script. Filming started the next month and wrapped in April. During the film&#x27;s post-production, creative differences between Welles and Universal executives arose and Welles was forced off the film. Subsequently, Universal-International revised the film&#x27;s editing style to be more conventional and ordered re-shoots to be made in November 1957. In response to the new version, Welles wrote a 58-page memo in which he elaborately outlined his creative vision for the film and asked that his version be restored.

Initially dismissed by film critics, &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; found popularity among European audiences and won top awards at the 1958 Brussels World Film Festival. During the 1970s, its reputation was renewed and it is now widely regarded as one of Welles&#x27;s best motion pictures and one of the last and best of the classic-era noir films. In 1998, Walter Murch re-edited &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; according to Welles&#x27;s original vision, as outlined in his memo.

In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==

Along the U.S.–Mexico border, a time bomb placed inside a vehicle explodes, killing two people. Mexican special prosecutor Miguel Vargas, who is honeymooning in town with his new American wife Susie, takes an interest in the investigation, which is being conducted by veteran police captain Hank Quinlan and his devoted, admiring, fanatically loyal assistant, Pete Menzies. Quinlan is a recovering alcoholic and an anti-Mexican bigot. He injured his leg long ago, and now walks with a prosthetic &quot;game&quot; leg and a cane. He implicates Sanchez, a young Mexican man secretly married to the victim&#x27;s daughter. During the interrogation at Sanchez&#x27;s apartment, Menzies finds two sticks of dynamite in a shoe-box in the bathroom. Vargas, who had accidentally knocked over the shoe-box a few minutes earlier and found it empty, accuses Quinlan of planting the dynamite, and begins to suspect that many of his previous convictions were similarly tainted. Quinlan angrily dismisses Vargas&#x27;s allegation.

&quot;Uncle&quot; Joe Grandi, the acting leader of a crime family Vargas has been investigating, makes common cause with Quinlan against Vargas, and plies Quinlan with liquor, causing him to break his sobriety. Grandi orders his family to capture and drug Susie with illegal recreational drugs; while she is unconscious, he and Quinlan lock her in a hotel room. Quinlan then murders Grandi and leaves the body there with Susie; however, drunk and exhausted, he carelessly also leaves his cane in the room with them. When Susie wakes up and sees the body, she screams for help, and gets arrested on suspicion of the murder, which infuriates Vargas. Searching the room, Menzies finds Quinlan&#x27;s cane, and realizes that Quinlan is the real killer.

Vargas, reviewing Quinlan&#x27;s past successes, confirms his suspicion that Quinlan has planted evidence in many of the cases. He confronts Menzies, who sadly agrees to work with him to expose Quinlan, by wearing a wire and getting a confession.

Quinlan hears an echo from Vargas&#x27; recording device, and realizes that Menzies is betraying him. He shoots and mortally wounds Menzies. He then aims his gun at Vargas, but the dying Menzies shoots Quinlan before he can fire. Susie is exonerated and reunited with Vargas. As Quinlan dies, it is revealed that Sanchez has confessed to the original bombing and that Quinlan&#x27;s efforts had all been for nothing.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development ===
In March 1956, the mystery novel &quot;Badge of Evil&quot; was released to generally favorable reviews and its sales were brisk, with two printings in hardcover. Edward Muhl, the head of production of Universal-International, believed the novel had cinematic possibilities and arranged to purchase the film rights through the literary agency Curtis Brown. By April 1956, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the film rights had been acquired and that Albert Zugsmith (known as the &quot;King of the Bs&quot;) had been tapped as producer. Zugsmith then assigned television writer Paul Monash to write the script adaptation within four weeks. Zugsmith then read Monash&#x27;s script, but did not care for it and temporarily halted any further development on the project. By December 1956, Zugsmith had received a memo from Universal executive Mel Tucker inquiring about the development of &quot;Badge of Evil&quot; and suggested the possibility of casting Charlton Heston as the lead.

By January 1957, having just finished promoting &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), Heston had received the script and considered it good enough. The actor contacted Universal to ask who they had considered to direct. They told him that they did not know, but Orson Welles was lined up as Hank Quinlan. Heston then replied, &quot;Why not him direct, too. He&#x27;s pretty good&quot; to which the studio responded &quot;We&#x27;ll get back to you.&quot; Universal studio head executives Ernest Nims and Jim Pratt—both of whom had worked with Welles on &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946)—lobbied for Welles to direct again. Based on Pratt&#x27;s suggestion, Universal-International offered Welles $125,000 for the job to act, direct, and based on his choosing, to rewrite the script. On January 11, it was officially announced that Welles had signed with Muhl to star in and direct &quot;Badge of Evil&quot;.

Welles had previously starred in &quot;Man in the Shadow&quot; (1957), which Zugsmith produced. According to Zugsmith, on the last day of shooting, Welles, who was impressed with Zugsmith&#x27;s writing abilities, expressed that he was interested in directing a picture for him. Zugsmith offered Welles a pile of scripts, of which he requested the worst one. Welles was then handed Monash&#x27;s script for &quot;Badge of Evil&quot; to which he asked, &quot;Can I have two weeks to write it?&quot; Zugsmith replied, &quot;You can have it.&quot;

=== Writing ===
For his screenplay draft, Welles made numerous changes along with smaller changes to better tighten the script. His two main contributions dealt with his thematic element of American racism and his decision to shift narrative points of view. He shifted the location setting from San Diego to the Mexico–United States border. Welles renamed the protagonist from Mitch Holt to Miguel Vargas, stating he made the character a Mexican &quot;for political reasons. I wanted to show how Tijuana and the border towns are corrupted by all sorts of mish-mash, publicity more or less about American relations&quot;. Welles&#x27;s shooting script was finished by February 5, 1957. Heston stated that Welles re-wrote the script in ten days.

=== Casting ===
Welles selected Janet Leigh for the role of Susan Vargas. Before her agent had notified her of the casting, Welles contacted Leigh via telegram stating how delighted he was to work with her on &quot;Badge of Evil&quot;. She contacted her agent, and accepted the part. Dennis Weaver was asked to audition as the night manager after Welles had watched him as Chester Goode on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He was instructed to improvise. Meanwhile, Zugsmith had met Joanna Cook Moore at a party, and was determined that she was right for the role as Marcia Linnekar. Welles rounded out the supporting cast with Akim Tamiroff, whom he previously cast in &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot; (1955), while Joseph Cotten, Ray Collins, Marlene Dietrich, and Keenan Wynn agreed to appear in the film for union pay scale and without screen credit. Zugsmith also insisted that his friend Zsa Zsa Gabor be given a cameo in the film. Ultimately, all actors were paid over union scale and given screen credit.

Having known Mercedes McCambridge since her time at Mercury Theatre, Welles called her and requested she arrive at the set. Leigh and the actors dressed as &quot;greasy-looking hoodlums&quot; stood around waiting for Welles to start filming. Welles had McCambridge&#x27;s hair cut and applied black shoe polish over her newly trim hair and eyebrows. According to her memoir: &quot;They brought a black leather jacket from somewhere, and I was &#x27;ready.&#x27; Orson said he wanted a heavy, coarse Mexican accent. I said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got it!&#x27;&quot;

Joseph Calleia was cast as Quinlan&#x27;s longtime partner Pete Menzies, giving Welles an opportunity to work with an actor he had long admired. &quot;What an actor—Joseph Calleia&quot;, said Welles:

I fell in love with him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York ... a very well-staged melodrama which was an enormous hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I&#x27;d seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He&#x27;s always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I&#x27;ve ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.

&quot;Even among these performers, one man&#x27;s sincerity stands out,&quot; wrote George E. Turner, film historian and editor of &quot;The American Cinematographer&quot;. &quot;Joseph Calleia, a veteran actor from Malta, makes Menzies the most realistic and touching character in the film. ... His agony is the true touchstone of the film.&quot;

=== Filming ===
The film was shot in Venice, California from February 18, 1957, to April 2, 1957. The location had been suggested by Aldous Huxley to Welles, who informed him the town had decayed significantly. Welles, cinematographer Russell Metty, and the art directors drove there, and upon viewing the city&#x27;s Bridge of Sighs, Welles decided to revise the ending to incorporate it. Sometime during the early months of filming, Zugsmith retitled the film to &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, which Welles later criticized calling it &quot;silly.&quot;

As when he worked with cinematographer Gregg Toland, Welles and Metty devised a distinctive visual style for &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;incorporating deep focus, off-kilter and low-angle shots (to emphasize the girth of Quinlan), and other stylistic touches that furthered the visual style of film noir. Most notable among the stylistic flourishes in the film is an opening crane shot that runs almost three-and-a-half minutes, which has frequently been commented on by film scholars.

Heston&#x27;s autobiography states that the scene with Vargas and Schwartz in the convertible marks the first time that a scene with dialogue was shot in a moving car, rather than a stationary one in front of a projection screen. However, there is an earlier example of such a scene in &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1950).

=== Post-production ===
As was typical, Welles himself worked on the film&#x27;s editing, paired initially with Edward Curtiss. According to Zugsmith, the two had creative differences, and Curtiss was replaced with Virgil Vogel. During June 1957, Welles flew out to New York to appear on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. In his absence, studio executives had scheduled a screening of the rough cut. Informed of this by Vogel, Welles was angered, resulting in Universal post-production head Ernest Nims cancelling the screening. At this point, Vogel agreed to step down, and Nims appointed Aaron Stell, another Universal staff editor, to finish the film. When Welles returned to Hollywood, Nims instructed him to stay out of the editing room and let Stell work alone. Having been locked out, Welles went to Mexico City in late June 1957 to begin shooting his next film, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

On his own, Stell constantly changed the editing sequence, providing different interpretations of multiple scenes in which he altered the continuity. Throughout the editing process, Stell was never satisfied, and at the end of his tenure, he stated he had grown &quot;ill, depressed and unhappy with the studio&#x27;s impatience.&quot; In July 1957, Stell&#x27;s cut was screened to the executives, most of whom were left unimpressed. According to Nims, Welles &quot;had really messed up those first five reels...He was making those quick cuts—in the middle of a scene you cut to another scene, and then come back and finish the scene, and then cut to the last half of the other scene.&quot;

Hoping to make the continuity editing more conventional, Muhl appointed Nims to re-edit the film. A month later, Nims&#x27;s cut was shown to Welles, who remained diplomatic but was astonished at the newly altered cut. Welles wrote a memorandum as a critique of Nim&#x27;s revisions, and shortly after, he left for Louisiana to appear in Martin Ritt&#x27;s &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; (1958). By November 1957, Universal removed about fifteen minutes from the film, and hired Harry Keller to film some expository scenes intended to make the plot easier to follow.

Out of loyalty to Welles, Heston and Leigh initially refused to film the re-shoots. A week later, Heston&#x27;s agents informed him that he was contractually obligated to film re-shoots if necessary. For the re-shoots, Clifford Stine had replaced Metty as the film&#x27;s cinematographer while new dialogue had been written by Franklin Coen, a staff scriptwriter for Universal. Several new scenes were filmed including four scenes between Vargas and his wife, a love scene in the car, and a scene where Menzies explains about Quinlan&#x27;s leg. Another scene was shot in which Quinlan&#x27;s car meets Vargas&#x27;s en route to the motel, in which an uncredited actor doubles for Welles. On November 19, re-shoots under Keller were completed. Heston further reflected in his journal: &quot;I have done worse work in the movies than this day&#x27;s retakes, but I don&#x27;t remember feeling worse...I was able to talk them out of one change I felt was a mistake.&quot;

On December 5, 1957, having been screened a new cut, Welles presented a 58-page memorandum addressed to Muhl, detailing what he thought needed to be done to make the film work. In response, Muhl stated his changes would be implemented, but also requested that Welles attend a dubbing session. Welles refused.

==Release==
===Initial release and reception===
On January 31, 1958, &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; was given a sneak preview at a theater in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. This version of the film ran 108 minutes, and was not well-received. Heston wrote in his journal that &quot;I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s simply not a good picture. It has the brilliance that made each day&#x27;s rushes look so exciting, of course. Indeed, there&#x27;s hardly a dull shot in the film. But it doesn&#x27;t hold together as a story.&quot; In February 1958, &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; was attached in a double bill with &quot;The Female Animal&quot;, starring Hedy Lamarr, which was also produced by Albert Zugsmith and directed by Harry Keller. The two films even had the same cameraman, Russell Metty. This general version ran only 94 minutes.

====Contemporary reviews====
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;...while good versus evil remains the text, the lasting impression of this film is effect rather than substance, hence its real worth.&quot; He complimented the film&#x27;s direction noting that &quot;Mr. Welles&#x27; is an obvious but brilliant bag of tricks. Using a superlative camera (manned by Russell Metty) like a black-snake whip, he lashes the action right into the spectator&#x27;s eye.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;As usual, Welles has placed mood above content. But what mood! &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; is underkeyed, underlighted and undermonitored (for sound), but with the assistance of Russell Metty&#x27;s marvelous mobile camera it charges ahead like the pure cinema it so often succeeds in being, complete with built-in stocks.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; felt that Welles &quot;has peopled the story with odd characterizations and, in an apparent effort to get away from routine picture-making, has made dramatic use of unusual photographic angles, shadows and lighting. This makes for an arty approach but it seems to lessen the dramatic impact of the story. The acting is very good, and a number of the individual scenes are tense and exciting.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; felt that &quot;Welles establishes his creative talent with pomp, but unfortunately the circumstances of the story suffer. There is insufficient orientation and far too little exposition, with the result that much of the action is confusing and difficult to relate to the plot...Welles&#x27; script contains some hard-hitting dialogue; his use of low-key lighting with Russell is effective, and Russell Metty&#x27;s photography is fluid and impressive; and Henry Mancini&#x27;s music is poignant. But &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; proves it takes more than good scenes to make a good picture.&quot; Dorothy Masters, reviewing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, gave the film three stars out of four noting that the &quot;Welles touch is manifest in a taut screen play, suspenseful presentation, stark backgrounds, off-beat camera angles and a weird assortment of characters. The production is advantage and are ably supported by the rest of the cast.&quot;

====Accolades====
Although Universal Pictures did its best to prevent &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; from being selected for the 1958 Brussels World Film Festival—part of the Expo 58 world&#x27;s fair—the film received its European premiere and Welles was invited to attend. To his astonishment, Welles collected the two top awards. &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; would also receive the International Critics Prize, and Welles was recognized for his body of work.

====Critical re-evaluation====
In 1998, Roger Ebert added &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; to his Great Movies list. He praised the lead and supporting actors and argued that the cinematography was &quot;not simply showing off&quot; but rather was used to add depth to the complex plot by showing interpersonal connections and &quot;trapping [the characters] in the same shots&quot;. Ebert also speculated Welles&#x27;s role was semi-autobiographical, describing his Quinlan character as nursing old feuds and demonstrating an obsessive desire for control that arguably parallels Welles&#x27;s life and career. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; stated that although the restored film was virtually the same, he noted the film&#x27;s plot is more coherent and that &quot;due to the pristine new print, Welles&#x27; technical virtuosity and ingenious use of locations have never been more evident, and the entire picture plays more smoothly.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Touch of Evil&quot; is a savvy starter because Welles&#x27; astonishing cinematic invention and his persuasive presence as star are prime noir attractions. The look, a deftly arranged climate of odd shadows and angles, neon lighting and flawlessly choreographed action scenes, keeps interest piqued through a contrived plot and mannered acting.&quot;

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; positively wrote the film was &quot;close to the pinnacle of film noir&quot; thanks to &quot;[w]izardly moving camera shots, nightmarish angles and incredibly florid, amusing performances&quot;. Kenneth Turan, reviewing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, summarized the 1998 re-cut: &quot;Photographed by Russell Metty, &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; is one of the standard-bearers for the kind of eye-catching, bravura camera work Welles favored. Expressionistic in the extreme, filled with shadows, angles and cinematic flourishes, the film raises the usual brooding nightmare ambience of film noir to a level few other pictures have attempted.&quot; In 2012, critic Manohla Dargis listed &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; as one of her ten favourite films of all time on 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll list.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 95% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 8.80/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;Artistically innovative and emotionally gripping, Orson Welles&#x27; classic noir is a visual treat, as well as a dark, sinister thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 99 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In 1998, &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine conducted a poll and the film was voted 57th greatest film of all time. In 2000, the film was ranked at No. 55 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 100 Greatest Films list. &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; was placed No. 64 on American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years, 100 Thrills&quot; list in 2001.

In the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Greatest Films of All Time 2012 poll, the film was placed No. 26 and No. 57 by the directors and the critics respectively. In 2015, the film ranked 51st on BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest American Films&quot; list, voted on by film critics from around the world.

===Restorations===
====1976 release====
During the early 1970s, Robert Epstein, a UCLA film studies professor, had requested a film print for a screening in his class. Inside the Universal archives, he discovered a 108-minute print of &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;. On December 15, 1973, it was publicly screened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as part of &quot;The 50 Great American Films&quot;. In June 1975, the American Film Institute, recognizing the historical value of the discovery, had submitted a duplicated negative to the Library of Congress for preservation. A 16 mm re-release provided through United World Films, Universal Pictures&#x27; non-theatrical distribution arm, was also discussed. Subsequently, it was screened at the Paris Film Festival, which was followed with a wide theatrical re-release by Universal Pictures that recognized an increased interest among film fans in Welles&#x27;s works.

In 1975, Jonathan Rosenbaum published an article in the film magazine &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, claiming that, except for a few minor details, the version was &quot;apparently identical to Welles&#x27; final cut,&quot; and described it as the &quot;definitive version&quot;. Joseph McBride, in a letter to &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, issued a correction, identifying the cut as the &quot;preview&quot; version.

====1998 release====
In 1998, Walter Murch, working from all available material, re-edited the film based on the Welles memo, with Rick Schmidlin who produced the re-edit and with the help of Bob O&#x27;Neil, Universal&#x27;s director of film restoration and Bill Varney, Universal&#x27;s Vice President of Sound Operations, participating in the restoration. As Welles&#x27;s rough cut no longer exists, no true &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; is possible but Murch was able to assemble a version incorporating most of the existing material, omitting some of the Keller scenes (though some were retained, either because they had replaced Welles&#x27;s lost scenes and were necessary to the plot or because Welles had approved of their inclusion). Some of Welles&#x27;s complaints concerned subtle sound and editing choices and Murch re-edited the material accordingly. Notable changes include the removal of the credits and Henry Mancini&#x27;s music from the opening sequence, cross-cutting between the main story and Janet Leigh&#x27;s subplot and the removal of Harry Keller&#x27;s hotel lobby scene. Rick Schmidlin produced the 1998 edit, which had a limited but successful theatrical release (again by Universal) and was subsequently made available on DVD. The DVD includes an on-screen reproduction of the 58-page memo.

Originally scheduled to be premiered at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival with Janet Leigh, Walter Murch and Rick Schmidlin attending, the screening was canceled at the eleventh hour after threats of litigation from Welles&#x27;s daughter, Beatrice Welles. Her suit against Universal, for not consulting her or obtaining her consent prior to the reworking of &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, was settled out of court. Welles later said she had only asked Universal to inform her on what was being done and when she was ignored, she told the Cannes Festival that the restoration was not sanctioned by the Welles Estate,

I saw it later and it was wonderful...I thought they did an amazing job, and it was very well done. It was what he wanted and it made much more sense than that chopped up nightmare there was before. It was fine and it was his. If they had told me that from the very beginning, none of that would have happened.

The 1998 re-edit received awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics.

===Home media===
The home media release history of &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; is summarized in the following table. The film was shot in the fullscreen Academy ratio with Welles reportedly composing his shots primarily with the newer 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio in mind, which Universal applied to all its new films using a hard matte. Universal preserved Academy ratio prints of the film for later broadcast on television. Both formats of the film have been released to home media.

<doc id="63506" wikidata="Q736344" url="?curid=63506" title="Don Lancaster">
<text>Donald E. Lancaster was an American author, inventor, and microcomputer pioneer.

==Background==
Don graduated from North Allegheny High School in Wexford, Pennsylvania. He received a BSEE degree from Lafayette College in 1961, and a MSEE from Arizona State University in 1967.

Lancaster was a writer and engineer, who wrote multiple articles for computer and electronics magazines of the 1970s, including &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;, &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;, &quot;73 Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Byte&quot;. He has written books on electronics, computers, and entrepreneurship, both commercially published and self-published.

One of his early projects was &quot;TV Typewriter&quot; serial terminal. The design was accepted by early microcomputer users as it used an ordinary television set for the display and could be built for around USD$200 in parts, at a time when commercial terminals were selling for over $1,000.

Lancaster was an early advocate and developer of what is now known as print-on-demand technology. Lancaster produced his self-published books by re-purposing the game port of an Apple II to transfer PostScript code directly to a laser printer, rather than using a Macintosh running PageMaker. This enabled continuous book production using an inexpensive Apple II, rather than tying up an expensive Macintosh until the print run was complete.

He formerly held a ham radio license (K3BYG).
