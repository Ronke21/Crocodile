<text>Murmansk () is a port city and the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast in the far northwest part of Russia. It is the world&#x27;s largest city north of the Arctic Circle and sits on both slopes and banks of a modest fjord, Kola Bay, an estuarine inlet of the Barents Sea, with its bulk on the east bank of the inlet. The city is a major port of the Arctic Ocean and is about from the border with Norway, from the border with Finland and from Moscow.

Benefiting from the North Atlantic Current, Murmansk resembles cities of its size across western Russia, with highway and railway access to the rest of Europe, and the northernmost trolleybus system on Earth. Its connectivity contrasts with the isolation of Arctic ports like the Siberian Dikson on the shores of the Kara Sea, and Iqaluit, in the Canadian Arctic. Despite long, snowy winters, Murmansk&#x27;s climate is moderated by the generally ice-free waters around it.

Although there was a building boom in the early twentieth century&#x27;s arms races, Murmansk&#x27;s population has been in decline since the Cold War, from to 270,384 (2021 Census).

==Etymology==
The name of the city is derived from &quot;Murman&quot;, from an old name for Norwegians by Russians, likely a borrowing from Old Norse &quot;&quot;, which gave its name to the Murman Coast and the surrounding region including the Kola Peninsula.

==History==


Murmansk was the last city founded in the Russian Empire. In 1915, World War I needs led to the construction of the railroad from Petrozavodsk to an ice-free location on the Murman Coast in the Russian Arctic, to which Russia&#x27;s allies shipped military supplies. The terminus became known as the Murman station and soon boasted a port, a naval base, and an adjacent settlement with a population that quickly grew in size and soon surpassed the nearby towns of Alexandrovsk and Kola.

On , 1916, Russian Transport Minister Alexander Trepov petitioned to grant urban status to the railway settlement. On , 1916, the petition was approved and the town was named Romanov-on-Murman (, &quot;Romanov-na-Murmane&quot;), after the Imperial Russian dynasty, the Romanovs. On , 1916, the official ceremony was performed, and the date is now considered the official date of the city&#x27;s foundation. After the February Revolution of March 1917, on , 1917, the town was given its present name.
In the winter of 1917 the British North Russia Squadron under Rear Admiral Thomas Kemp was based at Murmansk.

From 1918 to 1920, during the Russian Civil War, the town was occupied by the Western powers, who had been allied in World War I, and was also controlled by White Army forces.

On February 13, 1926, local self-government was organized in Murmansk for the first time, during a plenary session of the Murmansk City Soviet, which elected a Presidium. Before this, the city was governed by the authorities of Alexandrovsky Uyezd and later of Murmansk Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) issued two resolutions: &quot;On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast&quot; and &quot;On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast&quot;, which transformed Murmansk Governorate into Murmansk Okrug within Leningrad Oblast and made Murmansk the administrative center of Murmansk Okrug.

In 1934, the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee developed a redistricting proposal, which included a plan to enlarge the city by merging the surrounding territories in the north, south, and west into Murmansk. While this plan was not confirmed by the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee, in 1935–1937 several rural localities of Kolsky and Polyarny Districts were merged into Murmansk anyway.

According to the Presidium of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee resolution of February 26, 1935, the administrative center of Polyarny District was moved from Polyarnoye to Sayda-Guba. However, the provisions of the resolution were not fully implemented, and due to military construction in Polyarnoye, the administrative center was instead moved to Murmansk in the beginning of 1935. In addition to being the administrative center of Murmansk Okrug, Murmansk continued to serve as the administrative center of Polyarny District until September 11, 1938. On February 10, 1938, when the VTsIK adopted a Resolution changing the administrative-territorial structure of Murmansk Okrug, the city of Murmansk became a separate administrative division of the okrug, equal in status to that of the districts. This status was retained when Murmansk Okrug was transformed into Murmansk Oblast on May 28, 1938. The Germans were promised the use of the port they called for transportation of goods and raw materials from 1922 to 1941.

During World War II, Murmansk was a link to the Western world for the Soviet Union, with large quantities of goods important to the respective military efforts traded with the USSR&#x27;s Allies: primarily military equipment, manufactured goods and raw materials brought into the Soviet Union. The supplies were brought to the city in the Arctic convoys.

German forces in Finnish territory launched an offensive against Murmansk in 1941 as part of Operation Silver Fox. Fierce Soviet resistance and harsh local weather, with the bad terrain, prevented the Germans from capturing it. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombed the city 792 times during World War II. Murmansk suffered extensive destruction, the magnitude of which was rivaled only by the destruction in Leningrad and Stalingrad.

For the rest of the war, Murmansk served as a transit point for weapons and other supplies entering the Soviet Union from other Allied nations. The city&#x27;s resistance was commemorated at the 40th anniversary of the victory over the Germans in the formal designation of Murmansk as a Hero City on May 6, 1985. During the Cold War Murmansk was a center of Soviet submarine and icebreaker activity. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the nearby city and naval base of Severomorsk remains the headquarters of the Russian Northern Fleet.

In 1974, a massive tall statue &quot;Alyosha&quot;, depicting a Soviet World War II soldier, was installed on a high foundation. The Hotel Arctic opened in 1984, becoming the tallest building above the Arctic Circle.

On January 1, 2015, the territory of Murmansk was expanded when the urban-type settlement of Roslyakovo, previously under the jurisdiction of the closed administrative-territorial formation of Severomorsk, was abolished and its territory merged into Murmansk.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the City of Murmansk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Murmansk is incorporated as Murmansk Urban Okrug.

===City divisions===
, the city is divided into three administrative okrugs:
*Leninsky (Ленинский (Lenin))
*Oktyabrsky (Октябрьский (October))
*Pervomaysky (Первомайский (First May))

City districts were established in Murmansk for the first time by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR of April 20, 1939; at the time, three city districts (Kirovsky, Leninsky, and Mikoyanovsky) were created. They were abolished on June 2, 1948. The same city districts were created for the second time on June 23, 1951.

Mikoyanovsky City District was renamed Oktyabrsky on October 30, 1957, but on September 30, 1958, all three city districts were again abolished. On June 10, 1967, two city districts were created (Leninsky and Oktyabrsky); Pervomaysky City District was split from Oktyabrsky on February 21, 1975. In the Charter of the Hero City of Murmansk, adopted on December 17, 1995, the districts started to be referred to as administrative okrugs.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Murmansk experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), with long and cold (though average by arctic standards) winters and short, cool summers. In the city, freezing temperatures are routinely experienced from October to May. Average temperatures exceed 0 degrees Celsius only from May through October. The average low during the coldest part of the year in Murmansk is approximately . However, temperatures routinely plunge below during the winter.

Murmansk&#x27;s brief summer is mild, with average highs in July exceeding . The city is slightly wetter during the summer than the winter and receives an annual average of just under of precipitation.

The &quot;midnight sun&quot; is above the horizon from 22 May to 23 July (63 days), and the period with continuous darkness is somewhat shorter — the polar night lasts from 2 December to 10 January (40 days).

Extreme temperatures range from on January 6, 1985, and January 27, 1999, up to on July 9, 1972; the record cold daily maximum is , set on January 6, 1985, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is last set on July 9, 1972.

Murmansk&#x27;s evening newspaper is &quot;Vecherniy Murmansk&quot;; it has been published since 1991.

===Transportation===
The port of Murmansk remains ice-free year round due to the warm North Atlantic Current and is an important fishing and shipping destination. It is home port to Atomflot, the world&#x27;s only fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers.

The Port of Murmansk is the headquarters of Sevmorput (Northern Sea Route) and the administration of Russian Arctic maritime transport. In 2018, the Russian government transferred the main responsibility for the Northern Sea Route to Rosatom which through its ROSATOMFLOT subsidiary manages the Russian nuclear powered icebreaker fleet based in Murmansk.

Murmansk is linked by the Kirov Railway to St. Petersburg and is linked to the rest of Russia by the M18 Kola Motorway. Murmansk Airport provides air links to Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Buses and trolleybuses provide local transport.


====Arctic Bridge====
Murmansk is set to be the Russian terminus of the Arctic Bridge, a sea route linking it to the Canadian port of Churchill, Manitoba. Even though the passage has not been fully tested for commercial shipping yet, Russian interest in this project (along with the Northwest Passage) is substantial, as the bridge will serve as a major trade route between North America, Europe and Asia.

<text>Wi-Fi () is a family of wireless network protocols based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, which are commonly used for local area networking of devices and Internet access, allowing nearby digital devices to exchange data by radio waves. These are the most widely used computer networks, used globally in home and small office networks to link devices and to provide Internet access with wireless routers and wireless access points in public places such as coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, libraries, and airports.

&quot;Wi-Fi&quot; is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term &quot;&quot;Wi-Fi Certified&quot; to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing. Non-compliant hardware is simply referred to as WLAN, and it may or may not work with &quot;Wi-Fi Certified&quot;&quot; devices. the Wi-Fi Alliance consisted of more than 800 companies from around the world. over 3.05 billion Wi-Fi-enabled devices are shipped globally each year.

Wi-Fi uses multiple parts of the IEEE 802 protocol family and is designed to work well with its wired sibling, Ethernet. Compatible devices can network through wireless access points with each other as well as with wired devices and the Internet. Different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with different radio technologies determining radio bands, maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the UHF and SHF radio bands, with the 6 gigahertz SHF band used in newer generations of the standard; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks, but, within range, only one transmitter can transmit on a channel at a time.

Wi-Fi&#x27;s radio bands work best for line-of-sight use. Common obstructions, such as walls, pillars, home appliances, etc., may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. The range of an access point is about indoors, while some access points claim up to a range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves or as large as many square kilometers using multiple overlapping access points with roaming permitted between them. Over time, the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi have increased. some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware at close range, can achieve speeds of 9.6 Gbit/s (gigabit per second).

== History ==
A 1985 ruling by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission released parts of the ISM bands for unlicensed use for communications. These frequency bands include the same 2.4 GHz bands used by equipment such as microwave ovens, and are thus subject to interference.

In 1991 in Nieuwegein, the NCR Corporation and AT&amp;T invented the precursor to 802.11, intended for use in cashier systems, under the name WaveLAN. NCR&#x27;s Vic Hayes, who held the chair of IEEE 802.11 for ten years, along with Bell Labs engineer Bruce Tuch, approached the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to create a standard and were involved in designing the initial 802.11b and 802.11a specifications within the IEEE. They have both been subsequently inducted into the Wi-Fi NOW Hall of Fame.

In 1989 in Australia, a team of scientists began working on wireless LAN technology. A prototype test bed for a wireless local area network (WLAN) was developed in 1992 by a team of researchers from the Radiophysics Division of the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) in Australia, led by John O&#x27;Sullivan. A patent for Wi Fi was lodged by the CSIRO in 1992.

The first version of the 802.11 protocol was released in 1997, and provided up to 2 Mbit/s link speeds. This was updated in 1999 with 802.11b to permit 11 Mbit/s link speeds.

In 1999, the Wi-Fi Alliance formed as a trade association to hold the Wi-Fi trademark under which most IEEE 802.11 products are sold.

The major commercial breakthrough came with Apple Inc. adopting Wi-Fi for their iBook series of laptops in 1999. It was the first mass consumer product to offer Wi-Fi network connectivity, which was then branded by Apple as AirPort. This was in collaboration with the same group that helped create the standard: Vic Hayes, Bruce Tuch, Cees Links, Rich McGinn, and others from Lucent.

In 2000, Radiata, a group of Australian scientists connected to the CSIRO, were the first to use the 802.11a standard on chips connected to a Wi-Fi network.

Wi-Fi uses a large number of patents held by multiple different organizations. Australia, the United States and the Netherlands simultaneously claim the invention of Wi-Fi, and a consensus has not been reached globally. In 2009, the Australian CSIRO was awarded $200 million after a patent settlement with 14 technology companies, with a further $220 million awarded in 2012 after legal proceedings with 23 companies.

In 2016, the CSIRO&#x27;s WLAN prototype test bed was chosen as Australia&#x27;s contribution to the exhibition &quot;A History of the World in 100 Objects&quot; held in the National Museum of Australia.

== Etymology and terminology ==
The name &quot;Wi-Fi&quot;, commercially used at least as early as August 1999, was coined by the brand-consulting firm Interbrand. The Wi-Fi Alliance had hired Interbrand to create a name that was &quot;a little catchier than &#x27;IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence&#x27;.&quot; According to Phil Belanger, a founding member of the Wi-Fi Alliance, the term &quot;Wi-Fi&quot; was chosen from a list of ten names that Interbrand proposed. Interbrand also created the Wi-Fi logo. The yin-yang Wi-Fi logo indicates the certification of a product for interoperability. The name is often written as &quot;WiFi&quot;, &quot;Wifi&quot;, or &quot;wifi&quot;, but these are not approved by the Wi-Fi Alliance.

The name &quot;Wi-Fi&quot; is &quot;not&quot; short-form for &#x27;Wireless Fidelity&#x27;, although the Wi-Fi Alliance did use the advertising slogan &quot;The Standard for Wireless Fidelity&quot; for a short time after the brand name was created, and the Wi-Fi Alliance was also called the &quot;Wireless Fidelity Alliance Inc.&quot; in some publications. IEEE is a separate, but related, organization and their website has stated &quot;WiFi is a short name for Wireless Fidelity&quot;. The name &quot;Wi-Fi&quot; was partly chosen because it sounds similar to Hi-Fi, which consumers take to mean &quot;high fidelity&quot; or &quot;high quality&quot;. Interbrand hoped consumers would find the name catchy, and that they would assume this &quot;wireless&quot; protocol has high fidelity because of its name.

Other technologies intended for fixed points, including Motorola Canopy, are usually called &quot;fixed wireless&quot;. Alternative wireless technologies include Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth and mobile phone standards.

To connect to a Wi-Fi LAN, a computer must be equipped with a wireless network interface controller. The combination of a computer and an interface controller is called a &quot;station&quot;. Stations are identified by one or more MAC addresses.

Wi-Fi nodes often operate in infrastructure mode in which all communications go through a base station. &quot;Ad hoc mode&quot; refers to devices communicating directly with each other, without communicating with an access point.

A service set is the set of all the devices associated with a particular Wi-Fi network. Devices in a service set need not be on the same wavebands or channels. A service set can be local, independent, extended, mesh, or a combination. Each service set has an associated identifier, a 32-byte service set identifier (SSID), which identifies the network. The SSID is configured within the devices that are part of the network. A basic service set (BSS) is a group of stations that share the same wireless channel, SSID, and other settings that have wirelessly connected, usually to the same access point. Each BSS is identified by a MAC address called the &quot;BSSID&quot;.

== Certification ==
The IEEE does not test equipment for compliance with their standards. The Wi-Fi Alliance was formed in 1999 to establish and enforce standards for interoperability and backward compatibility, and to promote wireless local-area-network technology. The Wi-Fi Alliance enforces the use of the Wi-Fi brand to technologies based on the IEEE 802.11 standards from the IEEE. Manufacturers with membership in the Wi-Fi Alliance, whose products pass the certification process, gain the right to mark those products with the Wi-Fi logo. Specifically, the certification process requires conformance to the IEEE 802.11 radio standards, the WPA and WPA2 security standards, and the EAP authentication standard. Certification may optionally include tests of IEEE 802.11 draft standards, interaction with cellular-phone technology in converged devices, and features relating to security set-up, multimedia, and power-saving.

Not every Wi-Fi device is submitted for certification. The lack of Wi-Fi certification does not necessarily imply that a device is incompatible with other Wi-Fi devices. The Wi-Fi Alliance may or may not sanction derivative terms, such as Super Wi-Fi, coined by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to describe proposed networking in the UHF TV band in the US.

==Versions and generations==
Equipment frequently supports multiple versions of Wi-Fi. To communicate, devices must use a common Wi-Fi version. The versions differ between the radio wavebands they operate on, the radio bandwidth they occupy, the maximum data rates they can support and other details. Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.

Historically, the equipment listed the versions of Wi-Fi supported using the name of the IEEE standards. In 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced simplified Wi-Fi generational numbering to indicate equipment that supports Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance has stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.

The most important standards affecting Wi‑Fi are: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11–2012, 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), 802.11ay.

==Uses==

=== Internet ===
Wi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and Internet access to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected access points can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in wireless mesh networks in London. An international example is Fon.

Wi-Fi provides services in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free of charge or commercially, often using a captive portal webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities and businesses, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas. Routers often incorporate a digital subscriber line modem or a cable modem and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access for the structure.

Similarly, battery-powered routers may include a mobile broadband modem and a Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet. A number of smartphones have a built-in mobile hotspot capability of this sort, though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it. Standalone devices such as MiFi- and WiBro-branded devices provide the capability. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.

Multiple traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. Carnegie Mellon University built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called Wireless Andrew, at its Pittsburgh campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding existed. A number of universities collaborate in providing Wi-Fi access to students and staff through the Eduroam international authentication infrastructure.

=== City-wide ===

In the early 2000s, multiple cities around the world announced plans to construct citywide Wi-Fi networks. There are a number of successful examples; in 2004, Mysore (Mysuru) became India&#x27;s first Wi-Fi-enabled city. A company called WiFiyNet has set up hotspots in Mysore, covering the whole city and a few nearby villages.

In 2005, St. Cloud, Florida and Sunnyvale, California, became the first cities in the United States to offer citywide free Wi-Fi (from MetroFi). Minneapolis has generated $1.2 million in profit annually for its provider.

In May 2010, the then London mayor Boris Johnson pledged to have London-wide Wi-Fi by 2012. Several boroughs including Westminster and Islington already had extensive outdoor Wi-Fi coverage at that point.

New York City announced a city-wide campaign to convert old phone booths into digital kiosks in 2014. The project, titled LinkNYC, has created a network of kiosks that serve as public Wi-Fi hotspots, high-definition screens and landlines. Installation of the screens began in late 2015. The city government plans to implement more than seven thousand kiosks over time, eventually making LinkNYC the largest and fastest public, government-operated Wi-Fi network in the world. The UK has planned a similar project across major cities of the country, with the project&#x27;s first implementation in the London Borough of Camden.

Officials in South Korea&#x27;s capital Seoul were moving to provide free Internet access at more than 10,000 locations around the city, including outdoor public spaces, major streets, and densely populated residential areas. Seoul was planning to grant leases to KT, LG Telecom, and SK Telecom. The companies were supposed to invest $44 million in the project, which was to be completed in 2015.

=== Geolocation ===
Wi-Fi positioning systems use known positions of Wi-Fi hotspots to identify a device&#x27;s location. It is used when GPS isn&#x27;t suitable due to issues like signal interference or slow satellite acquisition. This includes assisted GPS, urban hotspot databases, and indoor positioning systems. Wi-Fi positioning relies on measuring signal strength (RSSI) and fingerprinting. Parameters like SSID and MAC address are crucial for identifying access points. The accuracy depends on nearby access points in the database. Signal fluctuations can cause errors, which can be reduced with noise-filtering techniques. For low precision, integrating Wi-Fi data with geographical and time information has been proposed.

The Wi-Fi RTT capability introduced in IEEE 802.11mc allows for positioning based on round trip time measurement, an improvement over the RSSI method. The IEEE 802.11az standard promises further improvements in geolocation accuracy.

=== Motion detection ===
Wi-Fi sensing is used in applications such as motion detection and gesture recognition.

== Operational principles ==
Wi-Fi stations communicate by sending each other data packets, blocks of data individually sent and delivered over radio on various channels. As with all radio, this is done by the modulation and demodulation of carrier waves. Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses direct-sequence spread spectrum on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing.

Channels are used half duplex and can be time-shared by multiple networks. Any packet sent by one computer is locally received by stations tuned to that channel, even if that information is intended for just one destination. Stations typically ignore information not addressed to them. The use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, so for example, available throughput to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.

As with other IEEE 802 LANs, stations come programmed with a globally unique 48-bit MAC address. The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored.

A scheme known as carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) governs the way stations share channels. With CSMA/CA stations attempt to avoid collisions by beginning transmission only after the channel is sensed to be idle, but then transmit their packet data in its entirety. CSMA/CA cannot completely prevent collisions, as two stations may sense the channel to be idle at the same time and thus begin transmission simultaneously. A collision happens when a station receives signals from multiple stations on a channel at the same time. This corrupts the transmitted data and can require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduces throughput, in some cases severely.

=== Waveband ===
The 802.11 standard provides several distinct radio frequency ranges for use in Wi-Fi communications: 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 3.6 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz and 60 GHz bands. Each range is divided into a multitude of channels. In the standards, channels are numbered at 5 MHz spacing within a band (except in the 60 GHz band, where they are 2.16 GHz apart), and the number refers to the centre frequency of the channel. Although channels are numbered at 5 MHz spacing, transmitters generally occupy at least 20 MHz, and standards allow for neighbouring channels to be bonded together to form a wider channel for higher throughput.

Countries apply their own regulations to the allowable channels, allowed users and maximum power levels within these frequency ranges. 802.11b/g/n can use the 2.4 GHz band, operating in the United States under FCC Part 15 rules and regulations. In this frequency band, equipment may occasionally suffer interference from microwave ovens, cordless telephones, USB 3.0 hubs, Bluetooth and other devices.

Spectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4 GHz band, while Japan has three more (12–14).

802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax can use the 5 GHz U-NII band, which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20 MHz channels. This is in contrast to the 2.4 GHz frequency band where the channels are only 5 MHz wide. In general, lower frequencies have longer range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.

As 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their bandwidth use. Additionally, they have gained the ability to aggregate channels together to gain still more throughput where the bandwidth for additional channels is available. 802.11n allows for double radio spectrum bandwidth (40 MHz) per channel compared to 802.11a or 802.11g (20 MHz). 802.11n can be set to limit itself to 20 MHz bandwidth to prevent interference in dense communities. In the 5 GHz band, 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz channels are permitted with some restrictions, giving much faster connections.

=== Communication stack ===

Wi-Fi is part of the IEEE 802 protocol family. The data is organized into 802.11 frames that are very similar to Ethernet frames at the data link layer, but with extra address fields. MAC addresses are used as network addresses for routing over the LAN.

Wi-Fi&#x27;s MAC and physical layer (PHY) specifications are defined by IEEE 802.11 for modulating and receiving one or more carrier waves to transmit the data in the infrared, and 2.4, 3.6, 5, 6, or 60 GHz frequency bands. They are created and maintained by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had many subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the market place, each revision tends to become its own standard.

In addition to 802.11, the IEEE 802 protocol family has specific provisions for Wi-Fi. These are required because Ethernet&#x27;s cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within the range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, the accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is, therefore, a best-effort delivery mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the Logical Link Control (LLC) specified by IEEE 802.2 employs Wi-Fi&#x27;s media access control (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.

For internetworking purposes, Wi-Fi is usually layered as a link layer below the internet layer of the Internet Protocol. This means that nodes have an associated internet address and, with suitable connectivity, this allows full Internet access.

===Modes===

====Infrastructure====
In infrastructure mode, which is the most common mode used, all communications go through a base station. For communications within the network, this introduces an extra use of the airwaves but has the advantage that any two stations that can communicate with the base station can also communicate through the base station, which limits issues associated with the hidden node problem and simplifies the protocols.

==== Ad hoc and Wi-Fi direct ====
Wi-Fi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary. This is called &quot;ad hoc&quot; Wi-Fi transmission. Different types of ad hoc networks exist. In the simplest case, network nodes must talk directly to each other. In more complex protocols nodes may forward packets, and nodes keep track of how to reach other nodes, even if they move around.

Ad hoc mode was first described by Chai Keong Toh in his 1996 patent of wireless ad hoc routing, implemented on Lucent WaveLAN 802.11a wireless on IBM ThinkPads over a size nodes scenario spanning a region of over a mile. The success was recorded in &quot;Mobile Computing&quot; magazine (1999) and later published formally in &quot;IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications&quot;, 2002 and &quot;ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review&quot;, 2001.

This wireless ad hoc network mode has proven popular with multiplayer video games on handheld game consoles, such as the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. It is also popular on digital cameras, and other consumer electronics devices. Some devices can also share their Internet connection using ad hoc, becoming hotspots or virtual routers.

Similarly, the Wi-Fi Alliance promotes the specification Wi-Fi Direct for file transfers and media sharing through a new discovery and security methodology. Wi-Fi Direct launched in October 2010.

Another mode of direct communication over Wi-Fi is Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS), which enables two devices on the same Wi-Fi network to communicate directly, instead of via the access point.

=== Multiple access points ===
An Extended Service Set may be formed by deploying multiple access points that are configured with the same SSID and security settings. Wi-Fi client devices typically connect to the access point that can provide the strongest signal within that service set.

Increasing the number of Wi-Fi access points for a network provides redundancy, better range, support for fast handover, and increased overall network capacity by using more channels or by defining smaller cells. Except for the smallest implementations (such as home or small office networks), Wi-Fi implementations have moved toward &quot;thin&quot; access points, with more of the network intelligence housed in a centralized network appliance, relegating individual access points to the role of dumb transceivers. Outdoor applications may use mesh topologies.

== Performance ==
Wi-Fi operational range depends on factors such as the frequency band, radio power output, receiver sensitivity, antenna gain, and antenna type as well as the modulation technique. Also, the propagation characteristics of the signals can have a big impact.

At longer distances, and with greater signal absorption, speed is usually reduced.

=== Transmitter power ===
Compared to cell phones and similar technology, Wi-Fi transmitters are low-power devices. In general, the maximum amount of power that a Wi-Fi device can transmit is limited by local regulations, such as FCC Part 15 in the US. Equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) in the European Union is limited to 20 dBm (100 mW).

To reach requirements for wireless LAN applications, Wi-Fi has higher power consumption compared to some other standards designed to support wireless personal area network (PAN) applications. For example, Bluetooth provides a much shorter propagation range between 1 and 100 metres (1 and 100 yards) and so in general has a lower power consumption. Other low-power technologies such as Zigbee have fairly long range, but much lower data rate. The high power consumption of Wi-Fi makes battery life in some mobile devices a concern.

===Antenna===
An access point compliant with either 802.11b or 802.11g, using the stock omnidirectional antenna might have a range of 0.1 km. The same radio with an external semi-parabolic antenna (15 dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 32 km.

Higher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect isotropic radiator, and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna. For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100 mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500 mW. This assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost; this may not be the case in some situations, especially in large buildings or within a waveguide. In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low-power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100 mW.

On wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide a higher gain in particular directions. Outdoor ranges can be improved to many kilometres through the use of high gain directional antennas at the router and remote device(s).

=== MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) ===
Wi-Fi 4 and higher standards allow devices to have multiple antennas on transmitters and receivers. Multiple antennas enable the equipment to exploit multipath propagation on the same frequency bands giving much higher speeds and longer range.

Wi-Fi 4 can more than double the range over previous standards.

The Wi-Fi 5 standard uses the 5 GHz band exclusively, and is capable of multi-station WLAN throughput of at least 1 gigabit per second, and a single station throughput of at least 500 Mbit/s. As of the first quarter of 2016, The Wi-Fi Alliance certifies devices compliant with the 802.11ac standard as &quot;Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac&quot;. This standard uses several signal processing techniques such as multi-user MIMO and 4X4 Spatial Multiplexing streams, and wide channel bandwidth (160 MHz) to achieve its gigabit throughput. According to a study by IHS Technology, 70% of all access point sales revenue in the first quarter of 2016 came from 802.11ac devices.

===Radio propagation===
With Wi-Fi signals line-of-sight usually works best, but signals can transmit, absorb, reflect, refract, diffract and up and down fade through and around structures, both man-made and natural. Wi-Fi signals are very strongly affected by metallic structures (including rebar in concrete, low-e coatings in glazing), rock structures (including marble) and water (such as found in vegetation).

Due to the complex nature of radio propagation at typical Wi-Fi frequencies, particularly around trees and buildings, algorithms can only approximately predict Wi-Fi signal strength for any given area in relation to a transmitter. This effect does not apply equally to long-range Wi-Fi, since longer links typically operate from towers that transmit above the surrounding foliage.

Mobile use of Wi-Fi over wider ranges is limited, for instance, to uses such as in an automobile moving from one hotspot to another. Other wireless technologies are more suitable for communicating with moving vehicles.

====Distance records====
Distance records (using non-standard devices) include in June 2007, held by Ermanno Pietrosemoli and EsLaRed of Venezuela, transferring about 3 MB of data between the mountain-tops of El Águila and Platillon. The Swedish National Space Agency transferred data , using 6 watt amplifiers to reach an overhead stratospheric balloon.

=== Interference ===

Wi-Fi connections can be blocked or the Internet speed lowered by having other devices in the same area. Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or non-Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the hidden node and exposed node problem.

A standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Interference can be caused by overlapping channels. Any two channel numbers that differ by five or more, such as 2 and 7, do not overlap (no adjacent-channel interference). The oft-repeated adage that channels 1, 6, and 11 are the &quot;only&quot; non-overlapping channels is, therefore, not accurate. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only &quot;group of three&quot; non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing. Channels that are four apart interfere a negligible amountmuch less than reusing channels (which causes co-channel interference)if transmitters are at least a few metres apart. In Europe and Japan where channel 13 is available, using Channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 for 802.11g and 802.11n is viable and recommended.

However, multiple 2.4 GHz 802.11b and 802.11g access-points default to the same channel on initial startup, contributing to congestion on certain channels. Wi-Fi pollution, or an excessive number of access points in the area, can prevent access and interfere with other devices&#x27; use of other access points as well as with decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between access points. These issues can become a problem in high-density areas, such as large apartment complexes or office buildings with multiple Wi-Fi access points.

Other devices use the 2.4 GHz band: microwave ovens, ISM band devices, security cameras, Zigbee devices, Bluetooth devices, video senders, cordless phones, baby monitors, and, in some countries, amateur radio, all of which can cause significant additional interference. It is also an issue when municipalities or other large entities (such as universities) seek to provide large area coverage. On some 5 GHz bands interference from radar systems can occur in some places. For base stations that support those bands they employ Dynamic Frequency Selection which listens for radar, and if it is found, it will not permit a network on that band.

These bands can be used by low power transmitters without a licence, and with few restrictions. However, while unintended interference is common, users that have been found to cause deliberate interference (particularly for attempting to locally monopolize these bands for commercial purposes) have been issued large fines.

=== Throughput ===
Various layer-2 variants of IEEE 802.11 have different characteristics. Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer-2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.

This means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.

Due to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g. VoIP) creates a data flow with high overhead traffic (low goodput).

Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e. the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.

The same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of UDP throughput measurements. Each represents an average throughput of 25 measurements (the error bars are there, but barely visible due to the small variation), is with specific packet size (small or large), and with a specific data rate (10 kbit/s – 100 Mbit/s). Markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included as well. This text and measurements do not cover packet errors but information about this can be found at the above references. The table below shows the maximum achievable (application-specific) UDP throughput in the same scenarios (same references again) with various WLAN (802.11) flavours. The measurement hosts have been 25 metres (yards) apart from each other; loss is again ignored.

== Hardware ==

Wi-Fi allows wireless deployment of local area networks (LANs). Also, spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs. However, building walls of certain materials, such as stone with high metal content, can block Wi-Fi signals.

A Wi-Fi device is a short-range wireless device. Wi-Fi devices are fabricated on RF CMOS integrated circuit (RF circuit) chips.

Since the early 2000s, manufacturers are building wireless network adapters into most laptops. The price of chipsets for Wi-Fi continues to drop, making it an economical networking option included in ever more devices.

Different competitive brands of access points and client network-interfaces can inter-operate at a basic level of service. Products designated as &quot;Wi-Fi Certified&quot; by the Wi-Fi Alliance are backward compatible. Unlike mobile phones, any standard Wi-Fi device works anywhere in the world.

=== Access point ===
A wireless access point (WAP) connects a group of wireless devices to an adjacent wired LAN. An access point resembles a network hub, relaying data between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.

=== Wireless adapter ===
Wireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as mini PCIe (mPCIe, M.2), USB, ExpressCard and previously PCI, Cardbus, and PC Card. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built-in internal adapters.

=== Router ===
Wireless routers integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet switch, and internal router firmware application that provides IP routing, NAT, and DNS forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, DSL modem, or optical modem. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated web server that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple&#x27;s AirPort, which is managed with the AirPort Utility on macOS and iOS.

=== Bridge ===
Wireless network bridges can act to connect two networks to form a single network at the data-link layer over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the wireless distribution system (WDS).

Wireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as consumer entertainment devices; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).
A dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.

=== Repeater ===
Wireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. Besides, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi-equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the &quot;weakest link&quot; in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighbouring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.

=== Embedded systems ===
The security standard, Wi-Fi Protected Setup, allows embedded devices with a limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The Internet of things and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. Several Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.

Increasingly in the last few years (particularly ), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that can communicate via a serial port. This allows the design of simple monitoring devices. An example is a portable ECG device monitoring a patient at home. This Wi-Fi-enabled device can communicate via the Internet.

These Wi-Fi modules are designed by OEMs so that implementers need only minimal Wi-Fi knowledge to provide Wi-Fi connectivity for their products.

In June 2014, Texas Instruments introduced the first ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller with an onboard dedicated Wi-Fi MCU, the SimpleLink CC3200. It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.

== Security ==
The main issue with wireless network security is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external firewall. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.

An attacker who has gained access to a Wi-Fi network router can initiate a DNS spoofing attack against any other user of the network by forging a response before the queried DNS server has a chance to reply.

=== Securing methods ===
A common measure to deter unauthorized users involves hiding the access point&#x27;s name by disabling the SSID broadcast. While effective against the casual user, it is ineffective as a security method because the SSID is broadcast in the clear in response to a client SSID query. Another method is to only allow computers with known MAC addresses to join the network, but determined eavesdroppers may be able to join the network by spoofing an authorized address.

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption was designed to protect against casual snooping but it is no longer considered secure. Tools such as AirSnort or Aircrack-ng can quickly recover WEP encryption keys. Because of WEP&#x27;s weakness the Wi-Fi Alliance approved Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) which uses TKIP. WPA was specifically designed to work with older equipment usually through a firmware upgrade. Though more secure than WEP, WPA has known vulnerabilities.

The more secure WPA2 using Advanced Encryption Standard was introduced in 2004 and is supported by most new Wi-Fi devices. WPA2 is fully compatible with WPA. In 2017, a flaw in the WPA2 protocol was discovered, allowing a key replay attack, known as KRACK.

A flaw in a feature added to Wi-Fi in 2007, called Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), let WPA and WPA2 security be bypassed. The only remedy was to turn off Wi-Fi Protected Setup, which is not always possible.

Virtual private networks can be used to improve the confidentiality of data carried through Wi-Fi networks, especially public Wi-Fi networks.

A URI using the WIFI scheme can specify the SSID, encryption type, password/passphrase, and if the SSID is hidden or not, so users can follow links from QR codes, for instance, to join networks without having to manually enter the data. A MeCard-like format is supported by Android and iOS 11+.

* Common format: codice_1
* Sample codice_2

=== Data security risks ===
Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (&quot;open&quot;) mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any wireless security, providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software graphical user interface (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a VPN, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Transport Layer Security (HTTPS).

The older wireless-encryption standard, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), has been shown easily breakable even when correctly configured. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) ratified in 2004 is considered secure, provided a strong passphrase is used. The 2003 version of WPA has not been considered secure since it was superseded by WPA2 in 2004.

In 2018, WPA3 was announced as a replacement for WPA2, increasing security; it rolled out on 26 June.

=== Piggybacking ===


Piggybacking refers to access to a wireless Internet connection by bringing one&#x27;s computer within the range of another&#x27;s wireless connection, and using that service without the subscriber&#x27;s explicit permission or knowledge.

During the early popular adoption of 802.11, providing open access points for anyone within range to use was encouraged to cultivate wireless community networks, particularly since people on average use only a fraction of their downstream bandwidth at any given time.

Recreational logging and mapping of other people&#x27;s access points have become known as wardriving. Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one&#x27;s Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the ISP. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and case law differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave graffiti describing available services was called warchalking.

Piggybacking often occurs unintentionally – a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default &quot;unsecured&quot; settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see DHCP and Zeroconf) this could lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see man-in-the-middle attack). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecured network to log into a website, thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an insecure protocol such as plain HTTP without TLS.

On an unsecured access point, an unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point and use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized or unlawful activities.

== Societal aspects ==
Wireless Internet access has become much more embedded in society. It has thus changed how the society functions in a number of ways.

=== Influence on developing countries ===
 over half the world did not have access to the Internet, prominently rural areas in developing nations. Technology that has been implemented in more developed nations is often costly and energy inefficient. This has led to developing nations using more low-tech networks, frequently implementing renewable power sources that can solely be maintained through solar power, creating a network that is resistant to disruptions such as power outages. For instance, in 2007, a network between Cabo Pantoja and Iquitos in Peru was erected in which all equipment is powered only by solar panels. These long-range Wi-Fi networks have two main uses: offer Internet access to populations in isolated villages, and to provide healthcare to isolated communities. In the case of the latter example, it connects the central hospital in Iquitos to 15 medical outposts which are intended for remote diagnosis.

=== Work habits ===
Access to Wi-Fi in public spaces such as cafes or parks allows people, in particular freelancers, to work remotely. While the accessibility of Wi-Fi is the strongest factor when choosing a place to work (75% of people would choose a place that provides Wi-Fi over one that does not), other factors influence the choice of specific hotspots. These vary from the accessibility of other resources, like books, the location of the workplace, and the social aspect of meeting other people in the same place. Moreover, the increase of people working from public places results in more customers for local businesses thus providing an economic stimulus to the area.

Additionally, in the same study it has been noted that wireless connection provides more freedom of movement while working. Both when working at home or from the office it allows the displacement between different rooms or areas. In some offices (notably Cisco offices in New York) the employees do not have assigned desks but can work from any office connecting their laptop to Wi-Fi hotspot.

=== Housing ===
The Internet has become an integral part of living. , 81.9% of American households have Internet access. Additionally, 89% of American households with broadband connect via wireless technologies. 72.9% of American households have Wi-Fi.

Wi-Fi networks have also affected how the interior of homes and hotels are arranged. For instance, architects have described that their clients no longer wanted only one room as their home office, but would like to work near the fireplace or have the possibility to work in different rooms. This contradicts architect&#x27;s pre-existing ideas of the use of rooms that they designed. Additionally, some hotels have noted that guests prefer to stay in certain rooms since they receive a stronger Wi-Fi signal.

== Health concerns ==
The World Health Organization (WHO) says, &quot;no health effects are expected from exposure to RF fields from base stations and wireless networks&quot;, but notes that they promote research into effects from other RF sources. (a category used when &quot;a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence&quot;), this classification was based on risks associated with wireless phone use rather than Wi-Fi networks.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s Health Protection Agency reported in 2007 that exposure to Wi-Fi for a year results in the &quot;same amount of radiation from a 20-minute mobile phone call&quot;.

A review of studies involving 725 people who claimed electromagnetic hypersensitivity, &quot;...suggests that &#x27;electromagnetic hypersensitivity&#x27; is unrelated to the presence of an EMF, although more research into this phenomenon is required.&quot;

== Alternatives ==
Several other wireless technologies provide alternatives to Wi-Fi for different use cases:
* Bluetooth Low Energy, a low-power variant of Bluetooth
* Bluetooth, a short-distance network
* Cellular networks, used by smartphones
* LoRa, for long range wireless with low data rate
* NearLink, a short-range wireless technology standard
* WiMAX, for providing long range wireless internet connectivity
* Zigbee, a low-power, low data rate, short-distance communication protocol

Some alternatives are &quot;no new wires&quot;, re-using existing cable:
* G.hn, which uses existing home wiring, such as phone and power lines

Several &quot;wired&quot; technologies for computer networking, which provide viable alternatives to Wi-Fi:
* Ethernet over twisted pair

<text>A Fresnel lens ( ; ; or ) is a type of composite compact lens which reduces the amount of material required compared to a conventional lens by dividing the lens into a set of concentric annular sections.

The simpler dioptric (purely refractive) form of the lens was first proposed by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and independently reinvented by the French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788–1827) for use in lighthouses. The catadioptric (combining refraction and reflection) form of the lens, entirely invented by Fresnel, has outer prismatic elements that use total internal reflection as well as refraction to capture more oblique light from the light source and add it to the beam, making it visible at greater distances.

The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design. A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a flat sheet.

Because of its use in lighthouses, it has been called &quot;the invention that saved a million ships&quot;.

== History ==

=== Forerunners ===

The first person to focus a lighthouse beam using a lens was apparently the London glass-cutter Thomas Rogers, who proposed the idea to Trinity House in 1788. The first Rogers lenses, 53cm in diameter and 14cm thick at the center, were installed at the Old Lower Lighthouse at Portland Bill in 1789. Behind each lamp was a back-coated spherical glass mirror, which reflected rear radiation back through the lamp and into the lens. Further samples were installed at Howth Baily, North Foreland, and at least four other locations by 1804. But much of the light was wasted by absorption in the glass.

In 1748, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon was the first to replace a convex lens with a series of concentric annular prisms, ground as steps in a single piece of glass,to reduce weight and absorption. In 1790 (although secondary sources give the date as 1773 or 1788), the Marquis de Condorcet suggested that it would be easier to make the annular sections separately and assemble them on a frame; but even that was impractical at the time. These designs were intended not for lighthouses, but for burning glasses. David Brewster, however, proposed a system similar to Condorcet&#x27;s in 1811, and by 1820 was advocating its use in British lighthouses.

=== Publication and refinement ===
The French (Commission of Lighthouses) was established by Napoleon in 1811, and placed under the authority of French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel&#x27;s employer, the Corps of Bridges and Roads. As the members of the commission were otherwise occupied, it achieved little in its early years. However, on 21 June 1819—three months after winning the physics of the Academy of Sciences for his celebrated memoir on diffraction—Fresnel was &quot;temporarily&quot; seconded to the commission on the recommendation of François Arago (a member since 1813), to review possible improvements in lighthouse illumination.

By the end of August 1819, unaware of the Buffon-Condorcet-Brewster proposal, Fresnel made his first presentation to the commission, recommending what he called (&#x27;lenses by steps&#x27;) to replace the reflectors then in use, which reflected only about half of the incident light. Another report by Fresnel, dated 29 August 1819 (Fresnel, 1866–70, vol. 3, pp. 15–21), concerns tests on reflectors, and does not mention stepped lenses except in an unrelated sketch on the last page of the manuscript. The minutes of the meetings of the Commission go back only to 1824, when Fresnel himself took over as Secretary. Thus the exact date on which Fresnel formally recommended is unknown. Much to Fresnel&#x27;s embarrassment, one of the assembled commissioners, Jacques Charles, recalled Buffon&#x27;s suggestion. However, whereas Buffon&#x27;s version was biconvex and in one piece, Fresnel&#x27;s was plano-convex and made of multiple prisms for easier construction.

With an official budget of 500 francs, Fresnel approached three manufacturers. The third, François Soleil, found a way to remove defects by reheating and remolding the glass. Arago assisted Fresnel with the design of a modified Argand lamp with concentric wicks (a concept that Fresnel attributed to Count Rumford), and accidentally discovered that fish glue was heat-resistant, making it suitable for use in the lens. The prototype, finished in March 1820, had a square lens panel 55cm on a side, containing 97 polygonal (not annular) prisms—and so impressed the Commission that Fresnel was asked for a full eight-panel version. This model, completed a year later in spite of insufficient funding, had panels 76cm square. In a public spectacle on the evening of 13 April 1821, it was demonstrated by comparison with the most recent reflectors, which it suddenly rendered obsolete.

Soon after this demonstration, Fresnel published the idea that light, including apparently unpolarized light, consists exclusively of transverse waves, and went on to consider the implications for double refraction and partial reflection.

Fresnel acknowledged the British lenses and Buffon&#x27;s invention in a memoir read on 29 July 1822 and printed in the same year. The date of that memoir may be the source of the claim that Fresnel&#x27;s lighthouse advocacy began two years later than Brewster&#x27;s; but the text makes it clear that Fresnel&#x27;s involvement began no later than 1819.

Fresnel&#x27;s next lens was a rotating apparatus with eight &quot;bull&#x27;s-eye&quot; panels, made in annular arcs by Saint-Gobain, giving eight rotating beams—to be seen by mariners as a periodic flash. Above and behind each main panel was a smaller, sloping bull&#x27;s-eye panel of trapezoidal outline with trapezoidal elements. This refracted the light to a sloping plane mirror, which then reflected it horizontally, 7 degrees ahead of the main beam, increasing the duration of the flash. Below the main panels were 128 small mirrors arranged in four rings, stacked like the slats of a louver or Venetian blind. Each ring, shaped like a frustum of a cone, reflected the light to the horizon, giving a fainter steady light between the flashes. The official test, conducted on the unfinished on 20 August 1822, was witnessed by the Commission—and by Louis XVIII and his entourage—from away. The apparatus was stored at Bordeaux for the winter, and then reassembled at Cordouan Lighthouse under Fresnel&#x27;s supervision—in part by Fresnel&#x27;s own hands. On 25 July 1823, the world&#x27;s first lighthouse Fresnel lens was lit. As expected, the light was visible to the horizon, more than out.

The day before the test of the Cordouan lens in Paris, a committee of the Academy of Sciences reported on Fresnel&#x27;s memoir and supplements on double refraction—which, although less well known to modern readers than his earlier work on diffraction, struck a more decisive blow for the wave theory of light. Between the test and the reassembly at Cordouan, Fresnel submitted his papers on photoelasticity (16 September 1822), elliptical and circular polarization and optical rotation (9 December), and partial reflection and total internal reflection (7 January 1823), essentially completing his reconstruction of physical optics on the transverse wave hypothesis. Shortly after the Cordouan lens was lit, Fresnel started coughing up blood.

In May 1824, Fresnel was promoted to Secretary of the , becoming the first member of that body to draw a salary, albeit in the concurrent role of Engineer-in-Chief. Late that year, being increasingly ill, he curtailed his fundamental research and resigned his seasonal job as an examiner at the , in order to save his remaining time and energy for his lighthouse work.

In the same year he designed the first &quot;fixed&quot; lens—for spreading light evenly around the horizon while minimizing waste above or below. Ideally the curved refracting surfaces would be segments of toroids about a common vertical axis, so that the dioptric panel would look like a cylindrical drum. If this was supplemented by reflecting (catoptric) rings above and below the refracting (dioptric) parts, the entire apparatus would look like a beehive. The second Fresnel lens to enter service was indeed a fixed lens, of third order, installed at Dunkirk by 1 February 1825. However, due to the difficulty of fabricating large toroidal prisms, this apparatus had a 16-sided polygonal plan.

In 1825 Fresnel extended his fixed-lens design by adding a rotating array outside the fixed array. Each panel of the rotating array was to refract part of the fixed light from a horizontal fan into a narrow beam.

Also in 1825, Fresnel unveiled the (&#x27;lighthouse map&#x27;), calling for a system of 51 lighthouses plus smaller harbor lights, in a hierarchy of lens sizes called &quot;orders&quot; (the first being the largest), with different characteristics to facilitate recognition: a constant light (from a fixed lens), one flash per minute (from a rotating lens with eight panels), and two per minute (16 panels).

In late 1825, to reduce the loss of light in the reflecting elements, Fresnel proposed to replace each mirror with a catadioptric prism, through which the light would travel by refraction through the first surface, then total internal reflection off the second surface, then refraction through the third surface. The result was the lighthouse lens as we now know it. In 1826 he assembled a small model for use on the , but he did not live to see a full-sized version: he died on 14 July 1827, at the age of 39.

=== After Fresnel ===

The first stage of the development of lighthouse lenses after the death of Augustin Fresnel consisted in the implementation of his designs. This was driven in part by his younger brother Léonor—who, like Augustin, was trained as a civil engineer but, unlike Augustin, had a strong aptitude for management. Léonor entered the service of the Lighthouse Commission in 1825, and went on to succeed Augustin as Secretary.

The first fixed lens to be constructed with toroidal prisms was a first-order apparatus designed by the Scottish engineer Alan Stevenson under the guidance of Léonor Fresnel, and fabricated by Isaac Cookson &amp; Co. using French glass; it entered service at the Isle of May, Scotland, on 22 September 1836. The first large catadioptric lenses were made in 1842 for the lighthouses at Gravelines and Île Vierge, France; these were fixed third-order lenses whose catadioptric rings (made in segments) were one metre in diameter. Stevenson&#x27;s first-order Skerryvore lens, lit in 1844, was only partly catadioptric; it was similar to the Cordouan lens except that the lower slats were replaced by French-made catadioptric prisms, while mirrors were retained at the top. The first &quot;fully&quot; catadioptric first-order lens, installed at Pointe d&#x27;Ailly in 1852, also gave eight rotating beams plus a fixed light at the bottom; but its top section had eight catadioptric panels focusing the light about 4 degrees ahead of the main beams, in order to lengthen the flashes. The first fully catadioptric lens with &quot;purely revolving&quot; beams—also of first order—was installed at Saint-Clément-des-Baleines in 1854, and marked the completion of Augustin Fresnel&#x27;s original &quot;Carte des Phares&quot;.

Thomas Stevenson (younger brother of Alan) went a step beyond Fresnel with his &quot;holophotal&quot; lens, which focused the light radiated by the lamp in nearly all directions, forward or backward, into a single beam. The first version, described in 1849, consisted of a standard Fresnel bull&#x27;s-eye lens, a paraboloidal reflector, and a rear hemispherical reflector (functionally equivalent to the Rogers mirror of 60 years earlier, except that it subtended a whole hemisphere). Light radiated into the forward hemisphere but missing the bull&#x27;s-eye lens was deflected by the paraboloid into a parallel beam surrounding the bull&#x27;s-eye lens, while light radiated into the backward hemisphere was reflected back through the lamp by the spherical reflector (as in Rogers&#x27; arrangement), to be collected by the forward components. The first unit was installed at North Harbour, Peterhead, in August 1849. Stevenson called this version a &quot;catadioptric holophote&quot;, although each of its elements was either purely reflective or purely refractive. In the second version of the holophote concept, the bull&#x27;s-eye lens and paraboloidal reflector were replaced by a catadioptric Fresnel lens—as conceived by Fresnel, but expanded to cover the whole forward hemisphere. The third version, which Stevenson confusingly called a &quot;dioptric holophote&quot;, was more innovative: it retained the catadioptric Fresnel lens for the front hemisphere, but replaced the rear hemispherical reflector with a hemispherical array of annular prisms, each of which used &quot;two&quot; total internal reflections to turn light diverging from the center of the hemisphere back toward the center. The result was an all-glass holophote, with no losses from metallic reflections.

James Timmins Chance modified Thomas Stevenson&#x27;s all-glass holophotal design by arranging the double-reflecting prisms about a vertical axis. The prototype was shown at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Later, to ease manufacturing, Chance divided the prisms into segments, and arranged them in a cylindrical form while retaining the property of reflecting light from a single point back to that point. Reflectors of this form, paradoxically called &quot;dioptric mirrors&quot;, proved particularly useful for returning light from the landward side of the lamp to the seaward side.

As lighthouses proliferated, they became harder to distinguish from each other, leading to the use of colored filters, which wasted light. In 1884, John Hopkinson eliminated the need for filters by inventing the &quot;group-flashing&quot; lens, in which the dioptric and/or the catadioptric panels were split so as to give multiple flashes—allowing lighthouses to be identified not only by frequency of flashes, but also by multiplicity of flashes. Double-flashing lenses were installed at Tampico (Mexico) and Little Basses (Sri Lanka) in 1875, and a triple-flashing lens at Casquets Lighthouse (Channel Islands) in 1876. The example shown (right) is the double-flashing lens of the Point Arena Light, which was in service from 1908 to 1977.

The development of hyper-radial lenses was driven in part by the need for larger light sources, such as gas lights with multiple jets, which required a longer focal length for a given beam-width, hence a larger lens to collect a given fraction of the generated light. The first hyper-radial lens was built for the Stevensons in 1885 by F. Barbier &amp; Cie of France, and tested at South Foreland Lighthouse with various light sources. Chance Brothers (Hopkinson&#x27;s employers) then began constructing hyper-radials, installing their first at Bishop Rock Lighthouse in 1887. In the same year, Barbier installed a hyper-radial at Tory Island. But only about 30 hyper-radials went into service before the development of more compact bright lamps rendered such large optics unnecessary (see &quot;Hyperradiant Fresnel lens&quot;).

Production of one-piece stepped dioptric lenses—roughly as envisaged by Buffon—became feasible in 1852, when John L. Gilliland of the Brooklyn Flint-Glass Company patented a method of making lenses from pressed and molded glass. The company made small bull&#x27;s-eye lenses for use on railroads, steamboats, and docks; such lenses were common in the United States by the 1870s. In 1858 the company produced &quot;a very small number of pressed flint-glass sixth-order lenses&quot; for use in lighthouses—the first Fresnel lighthouse lenses made in America. By the 1950s, the substitution of plastic for glass made it economic to use Fresnel lenses as condensers in overhead projectors.

== Design ==

The Fresnel lens reduces the amount of material required compared to a conventional lens by dividing the lens into a set of concentric annular sections. An ideal Fresnel lens would have an infinite number of sections. In each section, the overall thickness is decreased compared to an equivalent simple lens. This effectively divides the continuous surface of a standard lens into a set of surfaces of the same curvature, with stepwise discontinuities between them.

In some lenses, the curved surfaces are replaced with flat surfaces, with a different angle in each section. Such a lens can be regarded as an array of prisms arranged in a circular fashion with steeper prisms on the edges and a flat or slightly convex center. In the first (and largest) Fresnel lenses, each section was actually a separate prism. &#x27;Single-piece&#x27; Fresnel lenses were later produced, being used for automobile headlamps, brake, parking, and turn signal lenses, and so on. In modern times, computer-controlled milling equipment (CNC) or 3-D printers might be used to manufacture more complex lenses.

Fresnel lens design allows a substantial reduction in thickness (and thus mass and volume of material) at the expense of reducing the imaging quality of the lens, which is why precise imaging applications such as photography usually still use larger conventional lenses.

Fresnel lenses are usually made of glass or plastic; their size varies from large (old historical lighthouses, meter size) to medium (book-reading aids, OHP viewgraph projectors) to small (TLR/SLR camera screens, micro-optics). In many cases they are very thin and flat, almost flexible, with thicknesses in the range.

Most modern Fresnel lenses consist only of refractive elements. Lighthouse lenses, however, tend to include both refracting and reflecting elements, the latter being &quot;outside&quot; the metal rings seen in the photographs. While the inner elements are sections of refractive lenses, the outer elements are reflecting prisms, each of which performs two refractions and one total internal reflection, avoiding the light loss that occurs in reflection from a silvered mirror.

== Lighthouse lens sizes ==

Fresnel designed six sizes of lighthouse lenses, divided into four &quot;orders&quot; based on their size and focal length. The 3rd and 4th orders were sub-divided into &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot;. In modern use, the orders are classified as first through sixth order. An intermediate size between third and fourth order was added later, as well as sizes above first order and below sixth.

A first-order lens has a focal length of and stands about high, and wide. The smallest (sixth) order has a focal length of and a height of .

The largest Fresnel lenses are called hyperradiant (or hyper-radial). One such lens was on hand when it was decided to build and outfit the Makapuu Point Light in Hawaii. Rather than order a new lens, the huge optic construction, tall and with over a thousand prisms, was used there.

== Types ==

There are two main types of Fresnel lens: &quot;imaging&quot; and &quot;non-imaging&quot;. Imaging Fresnel lenses use segments with curved cross-sections and produce sharp images, while non-imaging lenses have segments with flat cross-sections, and do not produce sharp images. As the number of segments increases, the two types of lens become more similar to each other. In the abstract case of an infinite number of segments, the difference between curved and flat segments disappears.

Imaging lenses can be classified as:

; Spherical: A spherical Fresnel lens is equivalent to a simple spherical lens, using ring-shaped segments that are each a portion of a sphere, that all focus light on a single point. This type of lens produces a sharp image, although not quite as clear as the equivalent simple spherical lens due to diffraction at the edges of the ridges. This type is sometimes called a kinoform when the ridges are microscopic, at the wavelength scale.
; Cylindrical: A cylindrical Fresnel lens is equivalent to a simple cylindrical lens, using straight segments with circular cross-section, focusing light on a single line. This type produces a sharp image, although not quite as clear as the equivalent simple cylindrical lens due to diffraction at the edges of the ridges.

Non-imaging lenses can be classified as:

; Spot: A non-imaging spot Fresnel lens uses ring-shaped segments with cross sections that are straight lines rather than circular arcs. Such a lens can focus light on a small spot, but does not produce a sharp image. These lenses have application in solar power, such as focusing sunlight on a solar panel. Fresnel lenses may be used as components of Köhler illumination optics resulting in very effective nonimaging optics Fresnel-Köhler (FK) solar concentrators.
; Linear: A non-imaging linear Fresnel lens uses straight segments whose cross sections are straight lines rather than arcs. These lenses focus light into a narrow band. They do not produce a sharp image, but can be used in solar power, such as for focusing sunlight on a pipe, to heat the water within.

== Uses ==

=== Illumination ===

High-quality glass Fresnel lenses were used in lighthouses, where they were considered state of the art in the late 19th and through the middle of the 20th centuries. These lighthouse Fresnel lens systems typically include extra annular prismatic elements, arrayed in faceted domes above and below the central planar Fresnel, in order to catch all light emitted from the light source. The light path through these elements can include an internal reflection, rather than the simple refraction in the planar Fresnel element. These lenses conferred many practical benefits upon the designers, builders, and users of lighthouses and their illumination. Among other things, smaller lenses could fit into more compact spaces. Greater light transmission over longer distances, and varied patterns, made it possible to triangulate a position. Starting in the mid-20th century, most lighthouses have retired glass Fresnel lenses from service and replaced them with much less expensive and more durable aerobeacons or similar systems, including the Vega Industries VRB-25, which contains plastic Fresnel lens panels.
Perhaps the most widespread use of Fresnel lenses, for a time, occurred in automobile headlamps, where they can shape the roughly parallel beam from the parabolic reflector to meet requirements for dipped and main-beam patterns, often both in the same headlamp unit (such as the European H4 design). For reasons of economy, weight, and impact resistance, newer cars have dispensed with glass Fresnel lenses for sealed beam headlamp units, instead using multifaceted reflectors with plain polycarbonate lenses. However, Fresnel lenses continue in wide use in automobile tail, marker, and reversing lights.
Glass Fresnel lenses also are used in lighting instruments for theatre and motion pictures (see Fresnel lantern); such instruments are often called simply &quot;Fresnels&quot;. The entire instrument consists of a metal housing, a reflector, a lamp assembly, and a Fresnel lens. Many Fresnel instruments allow the lamp to be moved relative to the lens&#x27; focal point, to increase or decrease the size of the light beam. As a result, they are very flexible, and can often produce a beam as narrow as 7° or as wide as 70°. The Fresnel lens produces a very soft-edged beam, so is often used as a wash light. A holder in front of the lens can hold a colored plastic film (&quot;gel&quot;) to tint the light or wire screens or frosted plastic to diffuse it. The Fresnel lens is useful in the making of motion pictures not only because of its ability to focus the beam brighter than a typical lens, but also because the light is a relatively consistent intensity across the entire width of the beam of light.

Aircraft carriers and naval air stations typically use Fresnel lenses in their optical landing systems. The &quot;meatball&quot; light aids the pilot in maintaining proper glide slope for the landing. In the center are amber and red lights composed of Fresnel lenses. Although the lights are always on, the angle of the lens from the pilot&#x27;s point of view determines the color and position of the visible light. If the lights appear above the green horizontal bar, the pilot is too high. If it is below, the pilot is too low, and if the lights are red, the pilot is very low.

Fresnel lenses are also commonly used in searchlights, spotlights, and flashlights.

=== Imaging ===

Fresnel lenses are used as simple hand-held magnifiers. They are also used to correct several visual disorders, including ocular-motility disorders such as strabismus. Fresnel lenses have been used to increase the visual size of CRT displays in pocket televisions, notably the Sinclair TV80. They are also used in traffic lights.

Fresnel lenses are used in left-hand-drive European lorries entering the UK and Republic of Ireland (and vice versa, right-hand-drive Irish and British trucks entering mainland Europe) to overcome the blind spots caused by the driver operating the lorry while sitting on the wrong side of the cab relative to the side of the road the car is on. They attach to the passenger-side window.

Another automobile application of a Fresnel lens is a rear view enhancer, as the wide view angle of a lens attached to the rear window permits examining the scene behind a vehicle, particularly a tall or bluff-tailed one, more effectively than a rear-view mirror alone. Fresnel lenses have been used on rangefinding equipment and projected map display screens.

Fresnel lenses have also been used in the field of popular entertainment. The British rock artist Peter Gabriel made use of them in his early solo live performances to magnify the size of his head in contrast to the rest of his body, for dramatic and comic effect. In the Terry Gilliam film &quot;Brazil&quot;, Fresnel lenses are used as magnifiers for small CRT monitors in the Ministry of Information. The lenses occasionally appear between the actors and the camera, distorting the scale and composition of the scene to humorous effect. In the Pixar movie Wall-E, the protagonist watches the musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; on an iPod, magnified by a Fresnel lens.

Virtual reality headsets, such as the Meta Quest 2 and the HTC Vive Pro use Fresnel lenses, as they allow a thinner and lighter form factor than regular lenses. Newer devices, such as the Meta Quest Pro, have switched to a pancake lens design due to its smaller form factor and less chromatic aberration than Fresnel lenses.

Multi-focal Fresnel lenses are also used as a part of retina identification cameras, where they provide multiple in- and out-of-focus images of a fixation target inside the camera. For virtually all users, at least one of the images will be in focus, thus allowing correct eye alignment.

Many cameras are equipped with viewfinders which project the scene through a lens onto a ground glass screen for focusing and composition, including view, twin-lens reflex, and single-lens reflex cameras; often a Fresnel condenser lens is applied to the ground glass to increase the perceived brightness of the projected image and make the illumination more even from center to corner. For example, the Polaroid SX-70 camera uses a Fresnel reflector as part of its viewing system.

==== Projection ====

The use of Fresnel lenses for image projection reduces image quality, so they tend to occur only where quality is not critical or where the bulk of a solid lens would be prohibitive. Cheap Fresnel lenses can be stamped or molded of transparent plastic and are used in overhead projectors and projection televisions.

Fresnel lenses of different focal lengths (one collimator, and one collector) are used in commercial and DIY projection. The collimator lens has the lower focal length and is placed closer to the light source, and the collector lens, which focuses the light into the triplet lens, is placed after the projection image (an active matrix LCD panel in LCD projectors). Fresnel lenses are also used as collimators in overhead projectors.

=== Solar power ===

Since plastic Fresnel lenses can be made larger than glass lenses, as well as being much cheaper and lighter, they are used to concentrate sunlight for heating in solar cookers, in solar forges, and in solar collectors used to heat water for domestic use. They can also be used to generate steam or to power a Stirling engine to generate electricity.

Fresnel lenses can concentrate sunlight onto solar cells with a ratio of almost 500:1. This allows the active solar-cell surface to be reduced, lowering cost and allowing the use of more efficient cells that would otherwise be too expensive. In the early 21st century, Fresnel reflectors began to be used in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants to concentrate solar energy. One application was to preheat water at the coal-fired Liddell Power Station, in Hunter Valley Australia.

Fresnel lenses can be used to sinter sand, allowing 3D printing in glass.

<text>Overtone singing, also known as overtone chanting, harmonic singing, polyphonic overtone singing, or diphonic singing, is a set of singing techniques in which the vocalist manipulates the resonances of the vocal tract to arouse the perception of additional separate notes beyond the fundamental frequency that is being produced.

From a fundamental pitch, made by the human voice, the belonging harmonic overtones can be selectively amplified by changing the vocal tract: the dimensions and the shape of the resonant cavities of the mouth and the pharynx. That resonant tuning allows singers to create more than one pitch at the same time (the fundamental and one or more selected overtones) and usually generates a single fundamental frequency with their vocal folds.

Overtone singing should not be confused with throat singing, although many throat singing techniques include overtone singing. As mentioned, overtone singing involves the careful manipulations of the vocal tract, and throat singing is mostly related to the voice source.

== Asia ==
=== Mongolia and Buryatia ===

It is thought that the art of overtone singing originated in southwestern Mongolia in today&#x27;s Khovd Province and Govi Altai region. Nowadays, overtone singing is found throughout the country and Mongolia is often considered the most active center of overtone singing in the world. The most commonly practiced style, called (Cyrillic: ), can be divided up into the following categories:

* / labial khöömii
* / palatal khöömii
* / nasal khöömii
* / glottal, throat khöömii
* / chest cavity, stomach khöömii
* / khöömii combined with long song

Mongolians also use many other singing styles such as (literally &#x27;growling&#x27;) and .

=== Tuva ===

Tuvan overtone singing is practiced in the Republic of Tuva (southern Siberia, Russia).

The Tuvan way of singing overtones is based on appreciation of complex sounds with multiple layers or textures, which is how the Tuvans developed a wide range of rhythmic and melodic styles during the centuries. Most of the styles are sung with ( &#x27;chest&#x27; + &#x27;sing&#x27;), literally &#x27;to sing with chest voice&#x27;. Styles include:
* 
* (which also uses a second sound source made by false vocal folds. This technique is called &quot;false-folds-diplophony&quot;)

Other sub-styles include:
* ,
* .
* (a unique type of vibrato, mainly applied to khöömei and kargyraa styles)

The melodies are traditionally created by using the 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th and sometimes the 16th harmonics, which form the major pentatonic scale, so the 7th and 11th harmonics are carefully skipped.

The most peculiar melody, from Tuvan tradition, is &quot;&quot;, mostly performed in kargyraa style.

=== Altai and Khakassia ===
Tuva&#x27;s neighbouring Russian regions, the Altai Republic to the west and Khakassia to the northwest, have developed forms of throat singing called kai (, &quot;qay&quot;) or khai (, &quot;xay&quot;). In Altai, this is used mostly for epic poetry performance, to the instrumental accompaniment of a topshur. Altai narrators () perform in kargyraa, khöömei, and sygyt styles, which are similar to those in Tuva. They also have their own style, a very high harmonics, emerging from kargyraa. Variations of kai are:
* ,
* , and
The first well-known kai-chi was Alexei Kalkin.

=== Chukchi Peninsula ===
The Chukchi people of the Chukchi Peninsula in the extreme northeast of Russia also practice a form of throat singing.

=== Tibet ===
Tibetan Buddhist chanting is a subgenre of throat singing, mainly practiced by monks of Tibet, including Khokhonor (Qinghai) province in the Tibetan plateau area, Tibetan monks of Nepal, Bhutan, India, and various locations in the Himalayan region. Most often the chants hold to the lower pitches possible in throat singing. Various ceremonies and prayers call for throat singing in Tibetan Buddhism, often with more than one monk chanting at a time.
There are different Tibetan throat singing styles, such as Gyuke ( Wylie: ), which uses the lowest pitch of voice; Dzoke ( ); and Gyer ( ).

===Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan===
The poet-musicians of Kazakhstan and the Uzbek region of Karakalpakstan, known as , employ throat singing in their epic poetry recitations, accompanied by the dombra. singers believe that the ability to throat-sing is an innate gift of selected Kazakhs, and that it cannot be taught.

Besides zhirau, there is another form of throat singing called &quot;Kömeimen än aituw (Көмеймен ән айту)&quot; in Kazakhstan. This technique is similar to throat singing in Altai Republic. The Kömeimen än aituw is now being revived by famous Kazakh ethno-folk musical bands HasSak and Turan Ensemble, after Kazakhs believed that this form of throat singing might have been died out because of Russian conquest or rarely practiced or didn&#x27;t know them at all due to lack of documentings of this practice.

===Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan===
Balochi Nur Sur is one of the ancient forms of overtone singing and is still popular in parts of Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan – especially in the Sulaiman Mountains.

=== Kurdistan ===
Dengbêj, the Kurdish-Yazidi style of bardic chanting, often incorporates overtones as part of the chant, and in a way which is distinct from other forms of overtone singing. There is an article &#x27;Dengbêj - Kurdish long song and overtone singing&#x27; by Nick Hobbs in 2020 where he discusses the use of overtones in dengbêj in some detail. Dengbêj is largely a traditional style of Turkish Kurdistan and practitioners are mostly Anatolian. Dengbêj singers often also sing Kurdish folk song but overtones can rarely be heard in Kurdish traditional music outside of dengbêj.

==Europe==
===Sardinia===

On the island of Sardinia (Italy), especially in the subregion of Barbagia, one of the two different styles of polyphonic singing is marked by the use of throat singing. This kind of choir is called &quot;singing &quot;a tenore&quot;&quot;. The other style, known as &quot;cuncordu&quot;, does not use throat singing. Cantu a Tenore is practiced by groups of four male singers, each of whom has a distinct role; the &quot; &#x27;oche &quot; or &quot;boche&quot; (pronounced or , &quot;voice&quot;) is the solo voice, while the &quot; mesu &#x27;oche &quot; or &quot;mesu boche&quot; (&quot;half voice&quot;), &quot;contra&quot; (&quot;against&quot;), and &quot;bassu&quot; (&quot;bass&quot;) – listed in descending pitch order – form a chorus (another meaning of &quot;tenore&quot;). &quot;Boche&quot; and &quot;mesu boche&quot; sing in a regular voice, whereas &quot;contra&quot; and &quot;bassu&quot; sings with the use of the false vocal folds, just like the Tuvan Khoomei and Kargyraa techniques. In 2005, Unesco classed the &quot;cantu a tenore&quot; as an intangible world heritage. The most well known groups who perform the singing a Tenore are from Bitti, Orosei, Oniferi, and Neoneli. Each town has usually more than one group, and their name is based on a specific place, or monument, and then their hometown: for example: Tenore Su Remediu(place) de Orosei(Town).

===Northern Europe===
The Sami people of the northern parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia have a singing genre called yoik. While overtone techniques are not a defining feature of yoik, individuals sometimes utilize overtones in the production of yoik.

===Bashkortostan===
The Bashkirs of Bashkortostan, Russia have a style of overtone singing called &quot;özläü&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;uzlyau&quot;; Bashkort Өзләү), which has nearly died out. In addition, Bashkorts also sing uzlyau while playing the kurai flute, a national instrument. This technique of vocalizing into a flute can also be found in folk music as far west as the Balkans and Hungary.

===Andalusia===
In Flamenco&#x27;s Cante Jondo singers often include overtonal colour at the end of phrases. Perhaps originating as a way of facilitating sustain, and then becoming an appreciated ornamentation in its own right. There are many examples but Carmen Linares and Duquende often incorporate overtones. 

==Africa==
===South Africa===
Some Thembu Xhosa women of South Africa have a low, rhythmic style of throat-singing, similar to the Tuvan Kargyraa style, that is called umngqokolo. It is often accompanied by call-and-response vocals and complicated poly-rhythms.

==Non-traditional styles==
===Canada, United States, and Europe===
The 1920s Texan singer of cowboy songs, Arthur Miles, independently created a style of overtone singing, similar to sygyt, as a supplement to the normal yodelling of country western music. Blind Willie Johnson, also of Texas, is not a true overtone singer according to National Geographic, but his ability to shift from guttural grunting noises to a soft lullaby is suggestive of the tonal timbres of overtone singing.

Starting in the 1960s, some musicians in the West either have collaborated with traditional throat singers or ventured into the realm of throat singing and overtone singing, or both. Some made original musical contributions and helped this art rediscover its transcultural universality. As harmonics are universal to all physical sounds, the notion of authenticity is best understood in terms of musical quality. Musicians of note in this genre include Collegium Vocale Köln (who first began using this technique in 1968), Michael Vetter, Tran Quang Hai, David Hykes, Jill Purce, Jim Cole, Ry Cooder, Paul Pena (mixing the traditional Tuvan style with that of American Blues), Steve Sklar, and Kiva (specializing in jazz/ world beat genres and composing for overtone choirs). Others include composer Baird Hersey and his group Prana with Krishna Das (overtone singing and Hindu mantra), as well as Canadian songwriter Nathan Rogers, who has become an adept throat singer and teaches Tuvan throat singing in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Paul Pena was featured in the documentary &quot;Genghis Blues&quot;, which tells the story of his pilgrimage to Tuva to compete in their annual throat singing competition. The film won the documentary award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, and was nominated for an Oscar in 2000.

Tuvan singer Sainkho Namtchylak has collaborated with free jazz musicians such as Evan Parker and Ned Rothenberg. Lester Bowie and Ornette Coleman have worked with the Tenores di Bitti, and Eleanor Hovda has written a piece using the Xhosa style of singing. DJs and performers of electronic music like The KLF have also merged their music with throat singing, overtone singing, or with the theory of harmonics behind it.

Tran Quang Hai, a researcher on overtone singing since 1969 in Paris, France, has published many articles, videos on overtone singing from 1971. His film &quot;The Song of Harmonics&quot; directed by Hugo Zemp in 1989 obtained 4 international prizes in Estonia (1990) France (1990) and Canada (1991).

David Hykes, a pioneer in new music, contemplative chant and healing sounds, founded Harmonic Chant in New York in 1975, the year he also founded his legendary group, The Harmonic Choir, considered to be one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent overtone ensembles.

Wolfgang Saus, from Germany, is considered one of the major teachers/performers of &quot;polyphonic overtone singing&quot; in Europe. Formerly trained as a classical baritone, his unique skills make him instantly recognizable. He&#x27;s also a renowned composer and arranger of polyphonic overtone singing music for solo voice and choirs.

A cappella singer Avi Kaplan also exhibited overtone singing during his group&#x27;s (Pentatonix) performances. He merged throat singing together with a cappella dubstep.

The Overtone Choir Spektrum from Prague, Czech Republic, is unique among overtone choirs, particularly because it connects traditional choir singing with overtone techniques. It is the only one of its kind in the Czech Republic, and one of only a few in the world. 

MuOM Ecstatic Voices is another unique and peculiar overtone singing choir, as it combines in its own compositions Western overtone singing and Tuvan/Mongolian throat singing techniques (such as kargyraa, khoomei, sygyt, ezengiler, bonbarnadyr, among others). Created in Barcelona in 2008, with 8 singers on average, it has specialised in the creation of overtone polyphonies, (each singer is emitting an overtone) in addition to the polyphony of the fundamentals, creating two distinguishable sound planes.

Sherden Overtone Choir was founded in 2016 in Sardinia by Ilaria Orefice and Giovanni Bortoluzzi. The choir combines Tuvan Throat Singing Styles with Sardinian Throat singing.

Contemporary multi-instrumentalist performer The Suitcase Junket employs a self-taught overtone singing, or throat singing technique in his live and recorded performances.

Several contemporary classical composers have incorporated overtone singing into their works. Karlheinz Stockhausen was one of the first, with &quot;Stimmung&quot; in 1968. Tran Quang Hai (b.1944), a French national of Vietnamese origin, created the composition &quot;Ve Nguon&quot; with the collaboration of Vietnamese composer Nguyen Van Tuong in 1975, in Paris. &quot;Past Life Melodies&quot; for SATB chorus by Australian composer Sarah Hopkins (b. 1958) also calls for this technique. In &quot;Water Passion after St. Matthew&quot; by Tan Dun, the soprano and bass soloists sing in a variety of techniques including overtone singing of the Mongolian style.

In 2014 German singer Anna-Maria Hefele went viral on YouTube with her &quot;polyphonic overtone&quot; singing. The Huffington Post has commented on her &quot;amazing ability&quot; and her singing being &quot;utterly bizarre&quot;. On 10 October 2014, she was number two on The Guardian&#x27;s Viral Video Chart, with one online video titled &quot;Polyphonic Overtone Singing&quot;, which features Hefele as she demonstrates and explains overtones. As of February 2023, this video has received more than 20 million views.

Istanbul-based British singer Nikolai Galen incorporates overtones into his experimental work. They can be heard on his solo album Emanuel Vigeland, the Black Paintings album Screams and Silence and the Hoca Nasreddin album A Headful of Birds.

*1988: &quot;Carrie&quot; is notorious for its history as a flop on Broadway, and has gained a cult following in recent years. The musical was revived at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York, directed by Stafford Arima from January until April 2012. On September 25, 2012, the first official cast recording was released. The new production is currently available to license for professional and amateur productions from Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Theatricals.
*1990: &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; was an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s short stories &quot;The Return of Timmy Baterman,&quot; about zombies; &quot;Strawberry Spring,&quot; about a campus serial killer; &quot;Gray Matter,&quot; a black comedy about a hideous mutation caused by a bottle of beer; &quot;Uncle Otto&#x27;s Truck,&quot; and &quot;The Boogeyman,&quot; about a distraught father&#x27;s encounter with a child-killing closet monster, as well as selections from &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;. Adapted and directed by Robert Pridham, the play premiered at the Arts Center Theatre at Kent Place School in Summit, New Jersey, and toured the United States in the mid-1990s.
*1992: &quot;Misery&quot; stage play by Simon Moore based on 1987 novel. Another adaptation, written by William Goldman (who wrote the 1990 film), premiered on Broadway in 2015 with Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf. This version was also adapted to Polish language. It premiered at the Kwadrat Theatre in Warsaw in 2017. A musical version also exists, written by Jeff Hockhauser and Bob Johnson. While it has not been staged, a demo recording has circulated on the internet in recent years. There are also four Finnish-language stage adaptations of &quot;Misery&quot; under the name &quot;Piina&quot;: the first adaptation was performed in October 2019 by Tampere Theatre in Tampere, the second adaptation was performed in September of the same year by Kuopio City Theatre in Kuopio, the third adaptation was performed in November 2022 by Pori Theatre in Pori, and the fourth adaptation was performed in February 2025 by Seinäjoki City Theatre in Seinäjoki.
*1993: &quot;Rage&quot; stage play written by Phillip Smith, produced by Shane Black, and directed by Jim Birge. It was intended to premiere in Jasper, Indiana, but scheduling and venue issues due to protests over its mature themes forced it to move to the American Legion hall in Santa Claus, Indiana, where it ran from April 23 to May 1.
*2009: &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot; was dramatized by Dave Johns and Owen O&#x27;Neill for the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin. A later version, directed by Peter Sheridan, had its world premiere at the Peter Sheridan Theatre in London in September 2010. A production was mounted at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace in August 2013. In April 2019, The Shawshank Redemption made its North American debut at the Metropolitan Ensemble Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri, directed by Bob Paisley. It garnered great reviews from critics during its run. It featured Keenan Ramos as Red, Chris Roady as Andy Defresne, S.E. Perry as Warden Stammas, Tim Ahlenius as Hadley, Chad Burris as Boggs Diamond, Dan Daly as Pinky, Kevin Fewell as Brooksie, Christopher Preyer as Rooster, Larry Goodman as Dawkins, Nick Hazel as Entwhistle, Evan Lovelace as Tommy, Andrew Paredes as Rico, and Alex Paxton as inmate/guard.

*2013: &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; is an American opera composed by Tobias Picker. It premiered at the San Francisco Opera in Fall 2013.
*2014: &quot;The Body&quot; (also known as &quot;Stand By Me&quot;) was produced by Chellaston Players in Derby, England. Though an amateur staging (produced with Stephen King&#x27;s permission), it received rave reviews.

There have also been dramatizations of many of King&#x27;s short stories, including &quot;Nona&quot;, &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;In the Deathroom&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Spring&quot;, &quot;Harvey&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Loved Flowers&quot;, &quot;Mute&quot;, &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock People&quot; and King&#x27;s poem, &quot;&quot;.

<text>Different Seasons (1982) is a collection of four Stephen King novellas with a more dramatic bent, rather than the horror fiction for which King is famous. The four novellas are tied together via subtitles that relate to each of the four seasons. The collection is notable for having three out of its four novellas turned into Hollywood films, one of which, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, was nominated for the 1994 Academy Award for Best Picture, and another, &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, was nominated for the 1986 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Novellas==

==Title==
At the ending of the book, there is also a brief afterword, which King wrote on January 4, 1982. In it, he explains why he had not previously submitted the novellas (each written at a different time) for publication. Early in his career, his agents and editors expressed concern that he would be &quot;written off&quot; as someone who only wrote horror. However, his horror novels turned out to be quite popular and made him much in demand as a novelist. Conversely, the novellas, which did not deal (primarily) with the supernatural, were very difficult to publish as there was not a mass market for &quot;straight&quot; fiction stories in the 25,000- to 35,000-word format. Thus, King and his editor conceived the idea of publishing the novellas together as &quot;something different&quot;, hence the title of the book.

==Plot summaries==
=== &quot;Hope Springs Eternal&quot; - &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot;===
The story takes place in Maine at Shawshank State Penitentiary and is told from the first-person perspective of prisoner Ellis “Red” Reddings as he recounts his time in prison. His writings mainly focus on his friend and fellow prisoner, Andy Dufresne. Red opens by describing himself and why he was in prison- having staged a car accident in 1938 intended only to kill his wife after insuring his wife for a large amount of money, but incidentally also killed his neighbor and her child as his wife had offered to give them a ride- thus leading to him being sentenced soon after to serve three life sentences, one for each murder. One of Red’s most important aspects is that he’s “the guy who can get it for you” as his various connections allow him to easily smuggle contraband into the prison.

Red describes meeting Andy Dufrense for the first time in 1948, one year after Andy was potentially falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover, a well-to-do golfer. Andy asks Red to get him a rock hammer, stating that he is a “rock hound”. A year later, Andy asks Red to get him a large poster of Rita Hayworth. Red also details the various encounters he had during his time in prison, detailing his initial trouble with one of the prison’s rape gangs. Red insinuates that Andy eventually paid off the prison guards to beat up the leader of the rape gang, Bogs Diamond. Along with this, Red describes how Andy had become somewhat of a financial advisor to many of the prison’s guards and higher-ups through his encounter with prison guard, Byron Hadley, in which Andy advises him to use a loophole to avoid the taxation on the inheritance he recently received. Along with helping prison guards with their tax returns, loans, and any other financial advice, Andy begins to help some of the higher-ups with money laundering.

Andy eventually begins working as the prison’s librarian and expands it past its original location, a small room that was originally used to store paint. It is during this time that he meets prisoner fellow Tommy Williams. Tommy tells Andy that his former cellmate at the previous prison he was in, a man by the name of Elwood Blatch, had confided in Tommy that he had been the one who killed Andy’s wife and her lover. Andy uses this information to go to the prison’s warden, Samuel Norton, as a means to try and gain his freedom. Norton denies Andy’s request, stating he is far too valuable as an asset and that he knows too much since he aided the administration in money laundering. Norton sentences Andy to twenty days in solitary confinement and transfers Tommy to a different prison during his sentence.

Four years after his time in solitary confinement, Andy confronts Red and tells him about his pseudonym- “Peter Stevens”. Andy had sold all of his assets to this pseudonym before getting sentenced to prison, stating he had upwards of $370,000 in the bank waiting for him once he got out of prison. Andy shares that he intends to use this money to move to Zihuatanejo, Mexico, and open a small hotel. He implies that he wishes for Red to come with him when that day ever comes. On March 12, 1975, 8 years after Andy tells Red about his pseudonym, Andy is missing from his cell. They discover that he had used his rock hammer to create a hole in the prison wall through which he could escape and had hidden it behind the poster he hung up in his cell. Nine months after his escape, Red receives a blank postcard from McNary, Texas, and assumes that it is from Andy and that he has successfully crossed the border.

In 1977, Red was released on parole. He finds a note addressed to him from “Peter Stevens” inviting Red to join him in Zihuatanejo along with $1,000. The story ends with Red deciding to join Andy and sharing his hope for the future.

=== &quot;Summer of Corruption&quot; - &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;===
The story is set in Los Angeles in 1974 and is told in the third-person perspective. The story follows Todd Bowden from the age of thirteen up until he graduates high school. The story opens with Todd as he arrives at the doorstep of an elderly German immigrant, named Auther Denker, and accuses him of being Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander. Dussander does little to deny his identity and Todd insists that Dussander tells Todd about the crimes he had committed lest he turn him in to the authorities. Todd then begins to go to Dussander’s house every day demanding to know the details of all of his crimes in excruciating detail.

As months go by, Todd begins to have nightmares and his grades begin to slip. He resigns to forging his report card before giving it to his parents. Eventually, his school’s guidance counselor Ed French, requests to meet with Todd and his parents to discuss his failing grades. Todd, desperate for his parents not to find out convinces Dussander to pretend to be his grandfather and accompany him to the meeting. Now aware of his failing grades, Dussander uses this as blackmail to force Todd into studying during their meetings. Todd’s grades begin to improve and he decides he no longer has any need of Dussander and plots to kill him and make it seem like it was an accident. Todd tells Dussander that should anything happen to him he has a friend he gave a letter to listing all of Dussander’s crimes that will be mailed to the police upon his death. Dussander realizes Todd’s plot, however, and tells him that he wrote his statement and placed it in a safe deposit box so that if Todd were to kill him, the authorities would know he was willingly conversing with a war criminal. These statements prevent them from killing each other despite both of them lying about the ‘evidence’ they had on one another.

As the months go by, Todd begins killing homeless people on the street as it helps alleviate his nightmares. Years pass and Todd visits Dussander less and less. Todd greatly enjoys the thrill associated with killing, stating that he believes it to be better than sex. However, he is uncertain if he dislikes sex in comparison to the thrill of killing simply because he enjoys killing more or if sex with his girlfriend is unenjoyable because she is Jewish. Similarly to Todd, Dussander has also begun to have nightmares and kills homeless people to relieve them, burying the bodies in his basement.

One night when Dussander is burying one of his victims he has a heart attack. He asks Todd to clean up and hide the body before calling an ambulance and being sent to the hospital. While in the hospital Dussander shares a room with holocaust survivor Morris Heisel. Heisel does not immediately remember Dussander’s identity but makes it known that he remembers his face. Todd visits the hospital a few days later to tell Dussander that he would never visit him again, only for Dussander to tell Todd to be more careful with his murders.

Eventually, Heisel realizes “Mr. Denker”’s true identity as the commandant of the concentration camp where his wife and daughter were killed. Heisel contacts a Nazi hunter named Weiskopf to visit Dussander and tell him he had been found out. After the encounter, Dussander steals drugs from the hospital dispensary and commits suicide. Weiskopf along with police detective Richler then interviews Todd because of his connections to Dussander.

Later, French meets with Todd’s real grandfather and realizes that he had been lying when he said that Dussander had been his grandfather. This leads French to check Todd’s report cards and discover that Todd had been tampering with them. French confronts Todd, showing him a newspaper clipping describing Dussander’s death and his true identity. Todd kills French in retaliation. Afterward, Todd goes on a killing spree and is eventually killed by police five hours later.

=== &quot;Fall From Innocence&quot; - &quot;The Body&quot;===
Gordon &quot;Gordie&quot; Lachance reminisces about his childhood in Castle Rock, Maine. At that time, Gordie&#x27;s elder brother Dennis (also known as Denny), whom his parents favored, had recently died, leaving Gordie&#x27;s parents too depressed to pay much attention to him. In 1960, Gordie and his three friends − Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio − learn that a gang of hooligans led by John &quot;Ace&quot; Merrill have accidentally discovered the dead body of a missing boy named Ray Brower, who was hit by a train. Because the gang found the body while driving a stolen car, they elected not to report the body to the police. The boys get the idea to find the body &quot;officially&quot; so that they may become famous. In preparation for the expedition, Chris steals a gun from his father, and the boys camp out in a nearby field.

Over the course of the narrative, the adult Gordie recalls his first published story, Stud City, about the life of a simple man named Edward &quot;Chico&quot; May whose older brother also died. He has a girlfriend, Jane, who he does not have particularly strong feelings for. Chico knows that his stepmother Virginia slept with his brother before he died, but he hesitates to tell his father about it. One day, Chico has a fight with his father over Virginia and leaves the house.

Along the way, the boys trespass at the town dump and are chased by Chopper, the dump custodian Milo Pressman&#x27;s dog. Teddy gets into a verbal skirmish with Milo when the latter insults Teddy&#x27;s father (a WW2 veteran who was given a &quot;Section 8&quot; medical discharge for trauma related to the Normandy invasion) by calling him a &quot;loonie&quot;. Gordie and Vern are nearly run over by a train while crossing a trestle. While at a resting point, Gordie tells his friends another story, &quot;The Revenge of Lard-Ass Hogan&quot;, in which the titular Davie &quot;Lard-Ass&quot; Hogan exacts vengeance on the town locals for ridiculing his wide girth by downing a whole bottle of castor oil before engaging in the town&#x27;s annual pie-eating contest and vomiting on the previous year&#x27;s champion, which causes a chain reaction that nauseates the entire audience. The next morning, the boys stumble upon a small pond and partake in a swim, but jump out in horror when they find that the pond is teeming with leeches.

After a thunderstorm, the boys finally find the dead body. The body of Ray Brower was discovered to be mangled by the train while attempting to escape the locomotive&#x27;s path. Ace&#x27;s gang arrives shortly after. During an argument, Chris pulls the gun on the gang and forces them to leave, but Ace promises reprisals. Tired, depressed and fearing retaliation, the boys decide there is nothing more to be done with the body and return home. Subsequently, one of the gang members reports the body as an anonymous tip, and the gang members severely beat all four boys. The four friends eventually drift apart, but Gordie and Chris remain close. Chris decides to prepare for higher education, and with Gordie&#x27;s support, they both graduate from the University of Maine. In the present day, Gordie tells how he learned of Chris&#x27;s death after he was fatally stabbed while trying to stop an argument in a restaurant, about the deaths of Vern and Teddy (in a house fire and car accident respectively), about his successful writing career, and about his recent visit to Castle Rock, where he found that Ace has become an alcoholic and a worker at the town&#x27;s mill.

=== &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; - &quot;The Breathing Method&quot;===
David, the narrator of the frame tale, is a middle-aged Manhattan lawyer. At the invitation of a senior partner, he joins a strange gentlemen&#x27;s club where the members, in addition to reading, chatting and playing billiards and chess, like to tell stories, some of which range into the bizarre and macabre.

One Thursday before Christmas, the elderly physician Dr. Emlyn McCarron tells a story about an episode that took place early in his long and varied career: that of a patient, Sandra Stansfield, who was determined to give birth to her illegitimate child, no matter what, despite financial problems and social disapproval. McCarron comes to admire her bravery and humor, and the implication is that he has even fallen a bit in love with her.

Sandra masters Dr. McCarron&#x27;s unusual (for the 1930s) breathing method intended to help her through childbirth. However, when she goes into labor and is on the way to the hospital on an icy winter night, her taxi crashes and she is decapitated. McCarron arrives at the crash site and realizes that Sandra is somehow still alive. Her lungs in her decapitated body are still pumping air, as her head, some feet away, is working to sustain the breathing method so that the baby can be born. McCarron manages to deliver the infant alive and well.

On a sweet but haunting end note, Sandra whispers &quot;Thank you&quot;—her severed head mouthing the words, which are distortedly heard from the throat jutting from her headless body. McCarron is able to tell her that her baby is a boy and to see that she has registered this before she dies. McCarron and his office nurse pay for the woman&#x27;s burial, for she has no one else.

The child is adopted, and despite the confidential nature of adoption records, McCarron is able to keep track of him over the years. When the man is &quot;not yet 45&quot;, and an accomplished college professor, McCarron arranges to meet him socially. &quot;He had his mother&#x27;s determination, gentlemen,&quot; he tells the club members, &quot;and his mother&#x27;s hazel eyes.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
The second episode of the seventh season of the 2016 American television series &quot;Billions&quot; featured a copy of the book in the possession of a prisoner character played by Clancy Brown. Brown played a sadistic prison guard in the 1994 movie adaptation of &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot;.

<doc id="63995" wikidata="Q679633" url="?curid=63995" title="Professional wrestling match types">
<text>Many types of wrestling matches, sometimes called &quot;concept&quot; or &quot;gimmick matches&quot; in the jargon of the business, are performed in professional wrestling. Some gimmick matches are more common than others and are often used to advance or conclude a storyline. Throughout professional wrestling&#x27;s decades-long history, some gimmick matches have spawned many variations of the core concept.

==Singles match==
The singles match is the most common of all professional wrestling matches, which involves only two competitors competing for one fall. A victory is obtained by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout, or disqualification. One of the most common variations on the singles match is to restrict the possible means for victory.

===Blindfold match===
In a blindfold match, the two participants must wear a blindfold over their eyes for the entire duration of the match. A well-known example of this match is the WrestleMania VII match between Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts and Rick Martel.

===No count-out match===
A no count-out match is a singles match in which both competitors can stay outside of the ring without being counted out. A well-known example is at Vengeance (2003) between Stephanie McMahon and Sable, which Sable won.

===Pure wrestling rules match===
A pure wrestling rules match originally appeared in Ring of Honor (ROH), and still exists as the &quot;official rules&quot; for the ROH Pure Championship. Under the rules, each wrestler is allowed only three rope breaks; once they are all used, the wrestler cannot use the ropes to escape pins or submissions. Closed fists are illegal, and the first offense (if seen by the official) results in a warning. A second offense results in disqualification. The wrestlers must shake hands before and after the match.

===Special challenge match===
A special challenge match was often used in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) to refer to a singles match in which the champion is not defending the title, so the title doesn&#x27;t change hands if the champion loses the match. It can be announced by name, as a non-title match or as a singles match. It was also used in a tag team format. World TV Champion Arn Anderson vs. Paul Orndorff at Clash of the Champions XI was one example. Though Orndorff won the match, Anderson remained champion.

===Champion vs Champion match===
A champion vs. champion match can also be referenced to a Winner Takes All match, but in some cases each superstars&#x27; title is not contested in the match or only one title is on the line. During WWE&#x27;s second brand extension, this type of match was frequently used at Survivor Series, with both titles not defended, up until 2021, with the champion vs. champion matches being replaced by WarGames. This type of match has now been used at Crown Jewel since 2024, with both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s world title holders facing each other for a commemorative Crown Jewel Championship.

===Bloodsport/Underground match===
This event consists of a unique ruleset compared to a traditional pro wrestling event, in that every match must end in either a knockout or submission. The traditional wrestling ring is replaced by a ring canvas with no ropes or turnbuckles.

====GCW Bloodsport====

This event features worked shoot matches in a style that mimics the early days of MMA and catch wrestling. It is common for Bloodsport competitors to have some knowledge in other combat sports and/or MMA, as well as professional wrestling, as these one on one matches often appear stiff and have a feel of classic Shoot-style wrestling fights.

====Raw/NXT Underground====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, wrestling promotions were forced to hold events behind closed doors from March 2020 until July 2021. During the closed door period, WWE introduced a segment called Raw Underground in August that year. It was a &quot;Fight Club&quot; inspired concept hosted and commentated by Shane McMahon in Raw&#x27;s third hour and didn&#x27;t take place in the main arena, but rather in the basement of the WWE Performance Center, with only wrestlers and dancers present. The matches were held in a ring with no ropes and a black canvas, and were short work shoot style and could end by knockout, submission or McMahon&#x27;s call. Raw Underground segments aired from August 3 to September 21, 2020 in 8 episodes of Raw.

WWE&#x27;s NXT brand then adopted the concept beginning on the July 4 episode of NXT between Eddy Thorpe and Damon Kemp. Unlike when the match was on Raw, in NXT the match takes place in the main arena in front of the fans, with the ring ropes being taken down and a black canvas covering the ring. 
On the December 26, 2023 episode of NXT, Thorpe defeated Dijak in the second NXT Underground match.

The first women&#x27;s NXT Underground match took place on week 2 of NXT Spring Breakin&#x27; (2024), where Lola Vice defeated Natalya.

On NXT Battleground (2024), Vice defeated Shayna Baszler in the second NXT Underground match.

On NXT Deadline (2024), Vice defeated Jaida Parker in the third NXT Underground match.

==Battle royale-based variations==
The battle royale is a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left. Typical battle royales begin with 20 or more participants all in the ring at the same time, who are then eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor.

===Battlebowl===

The Battlebowl is a two-ring variation on a battle royale. In these matches, the wrestlers start in one ring and try to throw wrestlers into the second ring, after which they can be eliminated by being thrown out of that ring. The last remaining wrestler in the first ring can rest until only one wrestler is left in the second ring, after which they fight in both rings until one is eliminated and a winner is declared, in similar fashion to a double elimination tournament. This was held by World Championship Wrestling at the 1991 Starrcade event, but future Battlebowl matches were contested under normal battle royale rules.

===Battle Zone===
The battle zone features any number of men in a one-ring, over-the-top-rope elimination. A typical battle royale, except this one features tables covered with barbed wire, thumbtacks, and light bulbs on the outside of the ring, which may catch wrestlers as they are thrown out of the ring.

===Bunkhouse Stampede===
The National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s (NWA) Bunkhouse Stampede involved wrestlers wearing what was described as &quot;bunkhouse gear&quot;—cowboy boots, jeans, T-shirts—instead of their normal wrestling tights and not only allowed but encouraged the bringing of weapons. In 1988 the NWA named a pay-per-view after the Bunkhouse Stampede, headlined by a Bunkhouse Stampede match held inside a cage. Recently, the match has been revitalized by Ricky Morton of the Rock n&#x27; Roll Express at his wrestling academy in Chuckey, Tennessee.

===Hardcore battle royale===
A battle royale with hardcore rules (no disqualifications and no count-outs) involving several competitors in the ring at the same time. The match could last for either 15 or 20 minutes. All participants are not eliminated by being thrown out of the ring and both feet touching the floor. Pinning or forcing to submit whoever was current Hardcore champion would result in the victorious participant becoming the interim champion. Whoever the person held the title at end of the time limit would be declared the winner of the match and the official champion. The most famous example is the Hardcore Title Battle Royal from WWF&#x27;s WrestleMania 2000.

===Last Blood battle royale===
A last blood battle royale is essentially a multi-competitor First Blood match. All competitors start at the same time and wrestlers are eliminated when they start bleeding. The winner is the last wrestler in the match not bleeding. This match was held in the Tri-State Wrestling Association, a predecessor to Extreme Championship Wrestling.

===Reverse battle royale===
Generally used in TNA/Impact Wrestling, a reverse battle royale begins with wrestlers surrounding the ring instead of inside it. At the start of the match they battle for half of them to get into the ring, at which point a standard last person standing wins the battle royale.

The Cage Reverse Battle Royale is another TNA variation of this match type. This actually has three stages; It begins the first stage as an inside-out battle royale with 15 or more wrestlers involved. The first seven to enter the ring over the top cage will advance to the second stage which is a gauntlet match. When it gets down to the final stage, only two wrestlers will battle in a singles match which is decided by pinfall or submission.

===Semi-final battle royale===
A semi-final battle royale consists of a battle royale where when a specific number of wrestlers are remaining, the match ends, and those that remain are placed in a standard wrestling match for the prize at stake. An example of this occurred on a January 2024 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, where 20 women competed in a battle royal that became a Fatal 4-Way once there were four competitors remaining.

In All Elite Wrestling (AEW), it is known as a &quot;Dynamite Dozen Battle Royale&quot;, as twelve competitors compete until it is reduced to two, and there is a subsequent episode where the final two compete, in this case, &quot;AEW Dynamite Diamond Ring&quot;.

In New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), the 2021 New Japan Rumble at Wrestle Kingdom 15 was conducted as a semi-final battle royale. Chase Owens, Bad Luck Fale, Tetsuya Bushi, and Toru Yano were the final four that competed in a championship match the next day.

===Tag Team battle royale===
The tag team battle royale consist of designated tag teams of wrestlers with two members on the team. This match uses the normal battle royale rules, teams may be eliminated when either one or both partners are thrown over the top rope with both feet touching the floor. This match is conducted similarly to a battle royale but in these cases, both wrestlers are considered active at the same time and there are no tags using the tornado tag team stipulation.

This variation of the tag team battle royale was used during the 2011 WWE Draft on April 25, 2011; where the wrestler&#x27;s team has to eliminate all members of the opposing team, much like an elimination tag team match where the losing wrestler of a team, who just got thrown over the ring ropes with both feet touching the floor, must return to their locker room. The team winner receives a #1 draft pick for their respective brand. Another notable version of this match was used at the WrestleMania XV as well.

===World War 3===
Created by WCW in 1995, the World War 3 battle royale involved a three-ring setup and 60 competitors; 20 wrestlers started in each of the three rings, in which they would wrestle under regular battle royale rules. Once there were 30 competitors remaining (except in 1997, where the number was 20), all competitors would enter the center ring and continue under regular rules until only one wrestler was left standing.

==Cinematic match==
A cinematic match is not technically a match type itself, but rather, it is a term used to refer to matches that are produced with various cinematic techniques. The rules vary from match to match, but generally have a basis in hardcore wrestling. Unlike a normal wrestling match, which is done in one take and typically in front of a live audience, cinematic matches are shot over several hours with various scenes filmed, similar to filmmaking, with higher-budget production involved. The final product (the complete match) generally lasts from 20 to 40 minutes and airs at a later time, typically for a pay-per-view event. They are also usually filmed on-location or at a custom built set.

While not considered a cinematic match at the time, the Hollywood Backlot Brawl between Roddy Piper and Goldust at WrestleMania XII in 1996 is considered an early cinematic match by the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE), as it used techniques now featured in cinematic matches. Unlike future cinematic matches (which typically air during one segment), the match aired during several segments in between matches inside the ring, and featured both pre-taped segments outside the Arrowhead Pond of the two fighting as well as Piper &quot;chasing&quot; Goldust&#x27;s solid gold Cadillac in a white Ford Bronco in an obvious reference to the then-ongoing O. J. Simpson murder case. (Vince McMahon mentioned on commentary without completely breaking kayfabe that the &quot;footage looked awfully familiar&quot;; in reality, repurposed footage of Simpson&#x27;s infamous Bronco chase was actually used as part of the match.) The match eventually ended in the ring live, when Piper stripped Goldust down to women&#x27;s lingerie and kissed him as part of &quot;making him a man&quot;. WrestleMania XII featured a second cinematic match between &quot;The Huckster&quot; and &quot;Nacho Man&quot;.

At SummerSlam 1996, The Undertaker faced Mankind in a &quot;Boiler Room Brawl&quot; that was largely pre-taped, incorporating props and unorthodox camera angles.

In 2016, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling) held a match entitled the &quot;Final Deletion&quot; between brothers Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy for the July 5 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, which was filmed at Matt Hardy&#x27;s compound. It was a hardcore wrestling match with falls count anywhere. The sequel was a brawl between The Broken Hardys and Decay titled &quot;Delete or Decay&quot;. The Broken Hardys and Decay continued their feud at Bound for Glory, where Decay lost their TNA World Tag Team Championship to The Hardys in &quot;The Great War&quot;. The Hardys issued an open tag team invitational at their compound on the December 15 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, titled Total Nonstop Deletion. The main event was the &quot;Tag Team Apocalypto&quot; where The Hardys last defeated Decay.

Although not contested as a match, WWE followed this up shortly after and filmed a cinematic-style brawl between The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) and The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Erick Rowan, and Braun Strowman) that was held at The Wyatt Family Compound and shown on the July 11, 2016 episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;. WWE then taped their own cinematic match for their 2017 pay-per-view Payback, called a House of Horrors match between Randy Orton and Bray Wyatt. Similar to the &quot;Final Deletion&quot; match in TNA, this one was held at an abandoned house, but instead of falls count anywhere, this match had to end in the ring in the arena that the event was held in (the House of Horrors scenes were pre-taped, while the in-ring portion was live). The next cinematic match would occur on the March 19, 2018 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which featured Matt Hardy, who had returned to WWE and became &quot;Woken&quot; Matt Hardy, against Bray Wyatt and was called the &quot;Ultimate Deletion;&quot; this was just like the &quot;Final Deletion,&quot; including being held at Matt&#x27;s compound.

Cinematic matches became more frequent in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; the pandemic began affecting the professional wrestling industry in March that year, forcing promotions to hold events behind closed doors. WWE would hold several cinematic matches at their pay-per-views between March and August, being highly praised for the two that occurred at WrestleMania 36; a Boneyard match between The Undertaker and AJ Styles, which was a Buried Alive match held at a custom built cemetery set in the Orlando area, and a Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and &quot;The Fiend&quot; Bray Wyatt. (Although the match ended with The Fiend pinning Cena in a ring, the match itself was a dream-like sequence of Cena&#x27;s career, showing his perceived character flaws; the various segments were filmed at WWE&#x27;s Titan Towers headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut). Following this, cinematic matches occurred at Money in the Bank in May, which was the event&#x27;s eponymous ladder matches that occurred at WWE&#x27;s headquarters, a Backlot Brawl between Adam Cole and Velveteen Dream in the parking lot of Full Sail University at NXT TakeOver: In Your House in June, a cinematically produced singles match between Edge and Randy Orton at Backlash (billed as &quot;The Greatest Wrestling Match Ever&quot;) also in June, and a Wyatt Swamp Fight between Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules in July. Following the introduction of the WWE ThunderDome and Capitol Wrestling Center (CWC) staging arenas in August and October, respectively, the use of cinematic matches was greatly reduced, as these new staging arenas allowed fans to attend the events virtually. To go with the Halloween-theme at in October, a Haunted House of Terrors match was held between Dexter Lumis and Cameron Grimes, which was similar to the House of Horrors match from Payback 2017. Matches involving Randy Orton, &quot;The Fiend&quot; Bray Wyatt, and Alexa Bliss have also used cinematic techniques, such as the Firefly Inferno match between Orton and The Fiend at in December, where Orton set The Fiend&#x27;s entire body on fire, and an intergender match between Orton and Bliss at Fastlane in March 2021, where Bliss used supernatural powers. Since the resumption of live touring in July 2021, WWE ceased producing cinematic matches.

AEW also incorporated cinematic matches during pandemic restrictions in 2020 and 2021, most notably the Stadium Stampede match at Double or Nothing 2020, which was a 5v5 empty arena match in the TIAA Bank Field stadium. During that period, AEW featured at least one cinematic match at each of their PPVs: a &quot;Tooth and Nail match&quot; at All Out 2020 between Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D. and Big Swole at Baker&#x27;s real-life dental office, a match entitled &quot;The Elite Deletion&quot; at Full Gear 2020, featuring Matt Hardy against Sammy Guevara and similar to the other &quot;Deletion&quot; matches involving Hardy, and a tag team street fight pitting Darby Allin and Sting against Team Taz (Brian Cage and Ricky Starks) at Revolution 2021, which was held at an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Atlanta, Georgia. At Double or Nothing 2021 the Stadium Stampede match was a hybrid cinematic match with the first half recorded at TIAA Bank Field, then concluding live at the adjacent Daily&#x27;s Place. The audience in attendance watched the first half of the match on video screens before the action spilled into the amphitheater. This would be AEW&#x27;s final cinematic match produced before the company resumed live touring in July that year.

Impact Wrestling would also return to producing cinematic matches in 2021 when Ethan Page wrestled his alter ego &quot;The Karate Man&quot; at Hard to Kill in a &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;-style cinematic match that saw The Karate Man &quot;kill&quot; Page in what would be Page&#x27;s last appearance with Impact before leaving for AEW.

==Container-based variations==
Some matches have a container stationed in or near the ring, with the object of the match being to trap the opposing wrestler in it. All of these matches are fought under hardcore rules, and many of these matches take the name of the container, such as Ambulance match and the Casket match. A similar type of match aims to restrain opposing wrestlers somehow, and the match often takes the name of the restraining device – for example, the Stretcher. None of these matches can end in a pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification.

Common containers used for these matches are caskets (connected to The Undertaker&#x27;s Deadman persona, either using a typical coffin or a double-deep, double-wide casket, sometimes specially designed for specific opponents The Undertaker takes on), ambulances, dumpsters, hearses (known as a &quot;Last Ride match&quot;, also connected to The Undertaker gimmick), and stretchers.

===Ambulance match===
An Ambulance match is fought under hardcore rules, no pinfalls, no submissions, no disqualifications, no countouts and the only way to win is for one wrestler to force their opponent into the back of an ambulance and close the door. The first ambulance match took place at Survivor Series 2003 where Kane defeated Shane McMahon. The second one took place at Elimination Chamber (2012) which also involved Kane as one of the competitors. His opponent was John Cena, who won the match, where an additional rule was added in that the ambulance has to leave to win. The third Ambulance match was part of Three Stages of Hell match at WWE Payback on June 16, 2013, in Rosemont, Illinois between John Cena and Ryback for the WWE Championship. The most recent was at NXT Halloween Havoc in October 2024, between Ridge Holland and Andre Chase. The famous 2017 Lucha Underground &quot;Hell of War&quot; bout between Dante Fox (A.R. Fox) and Killshot (Swerve Strickland) was that promotion&#x27;s only ambulance match.

===Buried alive match===
A buried alive match is one in which the object is for one wrestler to throw his opponent into a grave dug out of a large mound of soil placed outside the ring. Once in the grave, the wrestler must bury his opponent in dirt and soil to the referee&#x27;s discretion. Equipment ranging from shovels and wheelbarrows to bulldozers are often made available to completely bury the opponent. The Buried Alive match is one of three of The Undertaker&#x27;s signature matches (the Casket and Last Ride matches being the others).

A cinematic Buried Alive match was held between The Undertaker and AJ Styles for WrestleMania 36, referred to as a &quot;Boneyard match&quot; . The match took place outdoors in a cemetery-like setting near an abandoned warehouse rather than in a traditional ring.

===Body Bag match===
A Body Bag match is a no-disqualification match where the objective is for a wrestler to put an opposing wrestler in a body bag situated in the middle of the ring for the victory. This was one of The Undertaker’s early gimmick matches; he had one of these matches in 1992 against The Ultimate Warrior at the Madison Square Garden.

===Casket match===

The casket match (also known as the Coffin match) has a casket near the ring, with the objective of the match being to trap the opposing wrestler inside. The casket match began its life as a one-off coffin match in the 1970s fought between Dusty Rhodes and Ivan Koloff. The coffin match was revived as one of The Undertaker&#x27;s signature matches and first appeared on television at the Survivor Series as the coffin match against Kamala. Prior to that, at a house show on July 14, 1991, the Ultimate Warrior defeated the Undertaker in a casket match in St. Louis, Missouri at Busch Stadium. There have been 17 casket matches, 11 of which have been won by The Undertaker. The 20th edition was held at Halloween Havoc and the first following the retirement of The Undertaker involving Grayson Waller vs. Apollo Crews in which Crews won. WWE held its first women&#x27;s casket match on the October 29, 2024 episode of &quot;NXT&quot; involving Tatum Paxley and Wendy Choo in which Paxley won.

In addition to WWE, the casket match has been adopted for use in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, All Elite Wrestling, and Lucha Underground, with Lucha Underground denominating it as the Grave Consequences (subsequently Graver Consequences) match. Another toned-down version of the Casket Match is when a victory is not obtained by placing the opponent in the coffin but by pinfall or submission. However, the defeated wrestler is then placed into the coffin.

====Last Rites match====
The Last Rites match is a Total Nonstop Action Wrestling variation where a casket is lowered into the center of the ring, and the objective is to get your opponent into the casket, which is raised to the ceiling following the match. The first Last Rites match was done between Sting and Abyss. Vince Russo came up with this match; it was perceived to be a disaster because neither wrestler could work properly due to the placement of the casket in the center of the ring, which limited and obstructed their workspace. The match was such a failure that during the match, the enraged crowd screamed &quot;Fire Russo!&quot; so loudly that the commentators had to yell into their microphones to be heard.

In 2023, TNA Wrestling brought back the Last Rites match, but modified it to be more of a basic casket match.

===Dumpster match===
A dumpster match is a no-disqualification, no-submission, no-countout, no-fall hardcore match in which the only objective to win is by forcing your opponent into a dumpster and closing the lid. The first match occurred was at WrestleMania XIV, pitting The New Age Outlaws against Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie.

The most recent Dumpster match taking place, was on the October 5th, 2024 episode of &quot;Smackdown&quot;, in which Michin powerbombs Chelsea Green through a table and into a Dumpster.

===Last Ride match===
A Last Ride match is a hardcore match similar to an Ambulance match, in which the victory condition is for one wrestler to force their opponent into the back of a hearse, close the door, and drive it out of the arena. The first match of this type occurred at No Mercy when Undertaker challenged John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield for the WWE Championship, although a match was held previously with similar stipulations. The second match of this type occurred at Armageddon when The Undertaker challenged Mr. Kennedy and defeated him. A variation of this match was used at NXT Spring Breakin&#x27;, called a Trunk match contested between Tony D&#x27;Angelo and Channing &quot;Stacks&quot; Lorenzo, who were the victors; and Pretty Deadly (Kit Wilson and Elton Prince).

==Enclosure-based variations==
Some matches take place in specific enclosed environments. Although the majority of these enclosures are set up either in or around the ring, some of them are placed apart from it. In all cases, the structure itself is considered &quot;in play&quot; and most enclosure-based matches are decided by pinfall or submission unless specific other stipulations are made beforehand.

===Steel cage match===

Steel cages are one of the oldest form of enclosures used in professional wrestling. The earliest known &quot;steel cage matches&quot; of any kind took place on January 9, 1936, in Caruthersville, Missouri, in a card that included two such &quot;chicken wire fence&quot; matches between Jez and Otto Ludwig, and Joe Dillman vs. Charles Sinkey. These matches took place in a ring surrounded by chicken wire, to keep the athletes inside, and prevent any potential interference. They have evolved a great deal over time, changing from chicken wire to steel bars to chain-link fencing (the latter is now the standard, due to it being cheaper to manufacture, lighter to transport, and more flexible and thus safer for the wrestlers).

A steel cage match is a match fought within a cage formed by placing sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against the edges of the wrestling ring. The most common way of winning is by simply escaping the cage, either over the top of the cage wall and having both feet touch the arena floor, or by escaping through the cage door with both feet touching the arena floor. The other occasional ways to win a steel cage match are by pinfall or by submission.

It is also possible to have one wrestler attempting to escape over the top of the cage wall while another tries to escape through the cage door. In Mexico, steel cage matches are won by just climbing to the top of the cage wall. In Impact Wrestling, the matches were previously branded &quot;Six Sides of Steel&quot; as the cage surrounded their six-sided ring.

===Asylum match===
The Asylum match is the name given to three different types of matches, involving a chain link cage in the shape of a circle placed in the middle of the ring.

The first type was a match created by Scott Steiner in WCW, held within a small chain link cage in the shape of a circle placed in the middle of the ring. Victory occurred only by submission.

On May 16, 2016, a second type was introduced and scheduled between Dean Ambrose and Chris Jericho at Extreme Rules, a variation to the steel cage match where weapons are suspended above the cage and escaping the cage is not a means of victory, leaving only pinfall or submission.

On August 10, 2019, a third type, which also included a barbed wire steel cage stipulation (a type of match where the steel cage door is locked with chains and a padlock), was introduced after Adam Cole and Johnny Gargano tied one to one after a normal match and a no holds barred match at NXT TakeOver: Toronto (2019) where weapons are connected to the steel cage and barbed wire on the top.

===Barbed Wire Steel Cage match===
A barbed wire steel cage match is a match that uses strands of barbed wire in a steel cage match in some capacity, usually around the top of the cage. Simply using barbed wire in an otherwise regular steel cage match does &quot;not&quot; make the match a barbed wire steel cage match; the barbed wire must be part of the cage&#x27;s design. This type of match is one where escape from the cage is almost impossible, because in addition to the barbed wire preventing escape over the top of the cage, the cage&#x27;s door is also locked with chains and a padlock, like a Hell in a Cell match. One particular example was John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield vs. Big Show at No Way Out 2005 where in addition to the barbed wire there was also razor wire wrapped around the top of the cage in a circular fashion; and another example was Adam Cole vs Johnny Gargano at NXT TakeOver: Toronto 2019 where in addition to the barbed wire and the chain-locked door, various weapons were made available at the top of the cage; this cage however did not have razor wire.

====Wire Steel Cage match====
Other variations are the razor wire steel cage match, a similar concept to that of the barbed wire cage match, however the barbed wire is replaced by larger and thicker razor wire and is wrapped around the top, corners, and walls of the cage, and barbed wire razor wire steel cage match is the same as the barbed wire cage match, however the top, corners, and walls of the cage are covered with barbed wire, then also further covered with razor wire. There are also boards in the ring that are covered in razor wire.

===Cage of Death match===

The Cage of Death match is a type of steel cage match with various weapons littered in the cage, such as electrified cage walls, cacti, tables, light tubes, glass, thumbtacks, baseball bats, barbed wire and numerous other weapons and objects. This match always features as the main event of CZW&#x27;s biggest show, Cage of Death. Some of these matches have been done under WarGames style rules with two rings being used.

===Chamber match===
In TNA, a Chamber match starts off between two wrestlers (or up to six) fighting inside a chamber. Wrestlers who were not involved in the match surrounded the chamber. About five minutes into the match, the outside wrestlers throw weapons into the chamber. This match only ends when one wrestler knocks out his opponent.

===Chamber of Extreme match===
In a Chamber of Extreme match, created by Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling (ECCW), an 8-feet-high steel cage surrounds the ringside area with the top wrapped in barbed wire and &quot;extreme&quot; weapons scattered around the ring and ringside area. Disqualifications, count-outs and rope-breaks do not apply. The winner is decided by pinfall, submission or being unable to stand up at 10-count.

===Chamber of Horrors match===
The Chamber of Horrors match was an enclosed steel cage match between two teams of four men. In the middle of the cage there was a smaller cage with an electric chair connected to a lever. The way to win this match is to put the opponent in the chair and switch the lever on (which was attached to the outer cage and six feet off the ground), so as, in kayfabe, the person is electrocuted. This match was used in WCW only once, with Abdullah the Butcher being electrocuted accidentally by his teammate Cactus Jack after being placed in the chair at the last second by Rick Steiner.

===Dixieland match===
A Dixieland match (named for TNA President Dixie Carter, who &quot;invented&quot; the match) is a hybrid steel cage/ladder match. The wrestlers start the match in the ring enclosed in a steel cage. To win the match, a wrestler must first climb out of the cage, then go up the entrance ramp where a championship belt is hung from the ceiling, and finally climb a ladder to retrieve the belt. The first match of this type occurred during the &quot;Impact Wrestling: Final Resolution&quot; taping on December 3, 2013, as Magnus defeated Jeff Hardy to become TNA World Heavyweight Champion.

===Doomsday Cage match===
Also called a Tower of Doom, the Doomsday Cage is a three-story cage – the middle one split into two rooms – all of which house wrestlers. The object of the match is for a team of wrestlers to fight their way from the top cage to the bottom, where pinfalls and submissions come into play. In the later days of WCW, it was referred to as a Triple Decker Cage match, a reference to the match type being used in the finale of the film &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot;. The most notable match of this type occurred at WCW&#x27;s Uncensored event in 1996, when Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage fought Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Meng, The Barbarian, Lex Luger, Kevin Sullivan, Z-Gangsta, and The Ultimate Solution.

===Doomsday Chamber of Blood match===
The Doomsday Chamber of Blood match was created by Abyss. This match is a combination of the Barbed Wire Cage, Six Sides of Steel and Sadistic Madness match types, with the cage having a barbed wire roof on top. This match is won by making your opponent bleed first, then pinning your opponent for the victory. Matt Morgan and Abyss competed in one of these matches at TNA&#x27;s Lockdown (2009) pay-per-view.

===Electrified Cage match===
The Electrified Cage match is a variation of a steel cage match where the ring is surrounded by an electrified steel cage. The cage can be also used as a weapon. The only way to win is by pinfall or submission. The Lucha en Jaula Electrificada is another variation of the electrified cage match in which the only way to win is by escape. The cage is turned off in a time interval, allowing the participants a chance at escape before it turns back on. This match type is used by the AAA promotion in Mexico.

===Elimination Chamber match===
The Elimination Chamber (known as No Escape in Germany to avoid a potential brand blunder over references of gas chambers in The Holocaust), which was the result of an idea by Triple H and introduced by Eric Bischoff for WWE in 2002, is a steel cage with a grid-locked, chain-linked enclosure with support bars that surrounds the ring entirely, including creating a steel grated (later padded) floor area on the apron. Inside the cage, at each turnbuckle, is a clear pod in which competitors in the match wait to join the match. As the name implies, this is an elimination-style match, so wrestlers are eliminated one-by-one via pinfall or submission until only one remains.

The original Chamber, used from 2002–16, was cylindrical, and a re-designed chamber introduced in 2017 was cubic, but still used the same materials with the same 4 enclosures.

An Extreme Elimination Chamber took place at the 2006 December to Dismember pay-per-view, where each waiting wrestler was given a weapon. Since 2010, WWE has held an eponymous Elimination Chamber pay-per-view every February, with this match type as one of its marquee matches. At its 2018 edition, the first-ever women&#x27;s Elimination Chamber match was held, as well as the first seven-man Elimination Chamber match.

===Fight Pit match===
The Fight Pit match is a variation of a cage match where the ring is surrounded by a steel cage rather than ropes and turnbuckles, with a catwalk surrounding the top. The catwalk also has chain-linked fence surrounding the outer edge (originally railings), which the wrestlers can climb up to and jump from. The match also has a no-pinfall stipulation, which means it can only be won by submission or knockout either by making the opponent unable to stand up at a 10-count or via technical knockout, making the match somewhat of a hybrid of a professional wrestling match and a mixed martial arts fight- MMA fights can only be won in those ways. The inaugural fight pit match was held during the May 27, 2020 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, between Matt Riddle and Timothy Thatcher (with Kurt Angle as a guest referee). A modified version of the Pit with chain-linked fencing was used at the Extreme Rules premium live event where Matt Riddle and Seth Rollins continued their rivalry (with UFC Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier as a guest referee). The match between Riddle &amp; Rollins was the first ever Fight Pit match in a WWE PPV.

===Hell in a Cell match===
The Hell in a Cell match is a specific kind of enclosure match run by WWE inside an enlarged 4-sided cuboid steel cage made from open-weave steel mesh chain-link fencing, which extends beyond the ring apron, leaving a gap between the edge of the ring and the Cell fence. As opposed to a conventional steel cage, the cell fencing continues across the top as a ceiling, hence the name &#x27;Cell&#x27;. Unlike a standard cage match, there is no escape clause because after the combatants enter the Cell, the door of the Cell is locked with chains and a padlock from the outside by referees to prevent the combatants from escaping (although it has been fairly common for Hell in a Cell matches to spill out of the cell and even onto the roof of the cage). The match has a no disqualification &quot;anything goes&quot; stipulation, and can only be won via pinfall or submission inside the ring. One exception could be made is Hell in a Cell 2018 and 2019 where the WWE Universal Championship match ended via stoppage.

Because of the &quot;anything goes&quot; rule, this match developed an infamous reputation in its early years. This match usually takes place on pay-per-view shows (there have only been five exceptions: four Cell matches occurred on &quot;Raw&quot;: two in 1998, one in 2011 (as a dark match), and one in 2021, while the first-ever Cell Match on &quot;Smackdown&quot; happened on June 18, 2021). Many wrestlers were legitimately injured during these matches (most notably Mick Foley) thanks to the dangerous bumps involved and the chain-link fencing of the Cell. In kayfabe, it is regarded as the most dangerous match in the entire promotion. Jim Ross has referred to the cell itself as &quot;a demonic structure&quot; that is &quot;custom built for injury&quot;. There have been 53 Hell in a Cell matches to date, with The Undertaker competing in 14 (with his last at WrestleMania 32), more than any other WWE performer. The first Hell in a Cell match was between The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels at Badd Blood: In Your House in St. Louis in October 1997.

====Kennel from Hell match====
A Kennel from Hell match was held at WWF&#x27;s Unforgiven pay-per-view in 1999, between Al Snow and The Big Boss Man for the WWF Hardcore Championship. The match was held within a steel cage, but with the Hell in a Cell cage also placed over the steel cage and the ring. The objective of the match was to escape through the door of the outer Hell in a Cell cage first, with the added obstacle of hostile attack dogs that would roam the apron between the two cages. This match was conceived by Vince Russo as part of Snow&#x27;s short-lived feud with The Big Boss Man—in which he had kidnapped and killed his pet chihuahua Pepper.

After being unable to obtain trained attack dogs, Russo sought dogs from local owners on short notice. The dogs were playful and friendly towards Russo, and during the match, they were seen urinating, defecating, and trying to mate with one another rather than making any attempt at attacking the wrestlers when they stepped outside the steel cage. The match was deemed by critics to be one of the worst gimmick matches, if not one of the worst matches in WWE history.

===Inferno match===
In an Inferno match (a type of no-disqualification, no-fall, no-submission, no-countout match), the ring is completely surrounded by flames once both contenders have entered the ring. The only way to win is to set your opponent on fire. Inferno matches usually end on the outside of the ring; this way, paramedics can assist the loser of the match. Due to the potentially graphic or dangerous nature of this type of match, it is very rarely seen in North America. , there have only been six inferno matches in WWE, with almost all of them have involved Kane, this being his signature match.

The first Inferno match took place in 1987 at the Juan Pachin Vicens coliseum in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where the ropes were simply soaked with gasoline and lit on fire. This kind of match was also done again in 1992 at FMW in Japan, and was called a Hellfire Deathmatch, which featured barbed wire as the ring ropes which were lit on fire. The match was a total disaster as wrestlers such as Sabu, his uncle The Original Sheik and Atsushi Onita, due to unbearably hot conditions, dashed out of the ring after just a minute. The Sheik was badly burned as a result and went into a coma. The first WWF Inferno Match was between Kane and The Undertaker at Unforgiven (1998) pay-per-view in Greensboro, North Carolina, and it was a safer and much more professional affair where special effects and pyrotechnics experts were brought in from Hollywood to set up and control the fire around the ring. Kane had been thrown out of the ring and the Undertaker had no way of attacking him unless he too went out of the ring. The match ended in the Undertaker&#x27;s victory. WCW also attempted an Inferno match, known as the Human Torch match, at The Great American Bash in 2000 between Sting and Vampiro.

Another version of the match known as the Firefly Inferno match was held at in 2020, between &quot;The Fiend&quot; Bray Wyatt and Randy Orton; its title referenced Wyatt&#x27;s &quot;Firefly Fun House&quot; gimmick. In addition to the ring being surrounded by fire, other objects that are placed around the ring are also set on fire.

Another variation of the Inferno match, dubbed a Ring of Fire match, took place at SummerSlam in 2013, when Kane faced Bray Wyatt. While the ring is surrounded by flames just like in a standard Inferno match, the match is decided by pinfall or submission and not by burning your opponent. In addition, the flames prevent others from possibly interfering in the match, as was the case with Luke Harper and Erick Rowan of The Wyatt Family.

===Lethal Lockdown match===

Similar to the WarGames match used in WCW, TNA/Impact Wrestling&#x27;s Lethal Lockdown consists of a single ring enclosed by a steel cage with two teams facing off with each other. The staggered entry system is identical, but weapons are permitted and are even provided. When all competitors have entered the ring, a roof is lowered onto the top of the cage, with various weapons hanging from it. Victory can be attained by pinfall or submission. This match has become a staple of TNA&#x27;s Lockdown pay-per-view event, but has also made appearances at other TNA pay-per-views.

===Lion&#x27;s Den match===
The Lion&#x27;s Den match is a steel cage match where a wrestler must knock out their opponent unconscious or make them submit inside an octagonal cage. The rules are made to mimic mixed martial arts matches, with the octagonal cage meant to mimic the cage used by the Ultimate Fighting Championship. This was Ken Shamrock&#x27;s specialty match; two examples were at the 1998 and 1999 editions of SummerSlam, where Shamrock respectively fought Owen Hart and Steve Blackman.

===Punjabi Prison match===

The Punjabi Prison match, named after the Punjab state that The Great Khali (the match&#x27;s founder) is billed from, consists of two large steel-reinforced bamboo cages. The first is four sided and stands 16 feet (4.8 m) tall, while the second has eight sides and stands 20 feet (6 m) and surrounds the first.

The inner cage has a four-foot (1.2 m) by four-foot door on each of its sides, with a referee standing by to open them at a wrestler&#x27;s request. Each door may only be opened once and is only allowed to remain open for sixty seconds, after which it is padlocked. Should all four doors end up locked before the wrestlers escape, they are forced to climb out over the top, where the bamboo is fashioned into spikes. Between the two cages are sometimes placed two tables, on which are weapons (both &quot;medieval&quot; and &quot;bamboo&quot; variations of standard wrestling weapons). There are also extended straps at the corners of the cage which can be used to choke the opponent. Once a wrestler has escaped the first cage, he must climb over and out of the second cage, with the first wrestler having both of their feet touch the arena floor becoming the winner of the match.

The match was revived with modifications in 2017 as the main event of Battleground, which featured the Indian-Canadian Jinder Mahal facing Randy Orton for the WWE Championship; The Great Khali made a surprise run-in to assist Mahal.

===Rage in a Cage match===
The Rage in a Cage match is held in an oval-shaped steel cage. It is typically used as the arena for the blowoff match of a feud and can be used for a tag team or singles match. In this match, wins are usually by pinfall or submission. Alternatively, Rage in a Cage may refer to the match that held in a Florida independent organization such as NWA Florida in which 20 or more wrestlers take part in a battle royale inside the oval-shaped steel cage. Each wrestler is encouraged to bring different weapons to the match, and a wrestler is eliminated by being thrown through the cage door. The last man standing wins.

===Scramble Cage match===
The Scramble Cage match was contested exclusively in Ring of Honor (ROH), in which the ring is surrounded by a steel cage with four wooden platforms at the corners of the cage to make the &quot;high risk&quot; wrestling moves. All participants are allowed to be inside and outside the cage at any time. The Scramble Cage Melee match is an elimination cage match held in a cage similar to the one used in the Scramble Cage match, with wooden platforms on the top corners. There are no pinfalls or submissions; wrestlers are eliminated only by aerial moves performed from the platforms. The first and only match took place at Ring of Honor (ROH) on August 24, 2004. The competitors in this match were Jack Evans, Trent Acid, H. C. Loc, Tony Devito, Dan Maff, B. J. Whitmer, Oman Turtuga, Diablo Santiago, Fast Eddie, Altar Boy Luke, Kevin Dunn and Kirby Marcos.

===Thundercage===

WCW&#x27;s Thundercage, based on the film &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot;, is a large domed structure of steel bars engulfing the ring. Although it does not have a top, the sides curve in to prevent escape.

Mexico&#x27;s AAA promotion tweaked the concept with the &quot;Domo de la Muerte&quot; (&quot;Dome of Death&quot;), which uses a similar cage but only allows victory by escaping through a hole at the top center. This variation is also used in TNA, where it was called the TerrorDome, or more recently the Steel Asylum. In AAA it is typically used for multi-man &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot; (bet matches), with the last man standing in the cage losing his mask or hair.

The Thunderdome is a variation on the Thundercage, with the area near the top of the cage electrified. The only way for a wrestler to win the Thunderdome match is to have their opponents&#x27; &quot;terminator&quot; (usually a manager who stands outside of the ring) throw in the towel to stop the match. In another variation of this match, each pinned competitor in the match is handcuffed to the cage. The last man left is given a key to unlock his teammates to attack the other team, who are still handcuffed. Ironically, the ThunderDome name was used for WWE&#x27;s bio-secure bubble during the pandemic between 2020 and 2021.

===Triple Cage match===
Triple cage matches have been held by WCW and its predecessor, Jim Crockett Promotions, in which two smaller cages are stacked on top of the cage enclosing the ring.

At The Great American Bash in 1988, a &quot;Tower of Doom&quot; match was held, in which two teams attempted to make their way from the uppermost cage to the bottom, with victory achieved when all five members of a team escaped a door there. The cages were cut off from each other, with doors controlled from outside by referees, who only opened them for two-minute intervals.

At Uncensored in 1996, a &quot;Doomsday Cage Match&quot; was held where Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage faced off against the Alliance to End Hulkamania, which consisted of Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Lex Luger, The Taskmaster, Meng, The Barbarian, The Ultimate Solution and Z-Gangsta. Hogan and Savage had to start at the top of the three tiered structure, and on each level there were members of the Alliance waiting for them. The structure featured scaffolding with steps on it to enable the wrestlers to traverse it, with the object being to make it to the bottom cage where the ring was and score a fall to win.

A triple cage match at Slamboree in 2000 was held between David Arquette, Diamond Dallas Page, and Jeff Jarrett; it was conducted similarly to a ladder match, with the objective being for the competitors to make their way to the roof of the third cage, and retrieve the championship belt. The roof of the first cage—which extended beyond the apron–had a trapdoor leading to the second cage, which contained weapons. The competitors then had to exit through a side door in the second cage, and climb the structure to reach the belt above the third cage. The third cage contained guitars, used for Jarrett&#x27;s signature move.

The same year, WCW conducted another match using the same structure, &quot;WarGames 2000: Russo&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, on an episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro.&quot; Despite sharing its name with WCW&#x27;s well-known WarGames match, its only similarity was its use of teams. A belt was placed inside the uppermost cage, with the first team to have a member escape from the bottom cage with the belt being declared the winner.

===WarGames match===

Sometimes suffixed with the tagline &quot;The Match Beyond,&quot; the WarGames match features two rings surrounded by an enclosed steel cage (usually with a roof), with two teams (or sometimes three) of four or five wrestlers facing one another. After a portion of the match fought one-on-one, members of the two teams begin to alternate entering the other ring at staggered intervals (with the order decided by a coin toss); once both teams&#x27; members have all entered the ring, the first team to score submission or surrender over a member of the opposing team is declared the winner. Depending on the rules used, a team may also win by scoring a knockout or pinfall.

This match was made famous by Jim Crockett Promotions&#x27; annual Great American Bash, and later WCW&#x27;s Wrestle War, before becoming a tradition at their annual Fall Brawl pay-per-view event from 1993 to 1998. At Fall Brawl 1998, a three-team WarGames match was held, with pinfalls counting. An in name only revamp of WarGames, &quot;WarGames 2000&quot;, was held on an episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;.

ECW held its own version of WarGames known as an &quot;Ultimate Jeopardy steel cage match&quot; (typically as part of an eponymous event), with weapons available, pinfalls counting, and the losing team receiving a stipulation as a penalty. In 2017, WWE&#x27;s NXT brand began to hold a live event known as NXT TakeOver: WarGames, which feature a version of the WarGames match as their signature event. The NXT version of WarGames does not use a roofed cage, and pinfalls count. In 2021, AEW held a WarGames match between The Pinnacle and The Inner Circle as a &quot;Blood and Guts match&quot;, during an eponymous special episode of its weekly series &quot;Dynamite&quot;. AEW adopted the WarGames rules that were used by WCW, with a roofed cage and no pinfalls.

===Xscape match===
The Xscape match has been held by TNA/Impact Wrestling as one of the signature matches of its Lockdown pay-per-view, which exclusively features cage matches. The match begins with four to eight competitors, who are eliminated by either pinfall or submission; eliminated wrestlers leave the cage through a door. When only two competitors remain, the first to escape the cage by climbing out and reaching the floor is declared the winner.

==Flag match==
The flag match is essentially the professional wrestling version of capture the flag. For the match two flags are placed on opposite turnbuckles, each representing a specific wrestler or team of wrestlers and the objective of the match is to retrieve the opponent&#x27;s flag and raise it while defending the flag in the wrestler&#x27;s corner. If the referee is knocked down and cannot acknowledge the win, the defender can put the flag back in its place, thus resetting the match.

===Anthem match===
An Anthem match is a variation of a flag match with the added stipulation that the national anthem of the winning wrestler&#x27;s or team&#x27;s home country will be played in the arena after the match, similarly to a medal ceremony. This can be used to promote patriotism for the face wrestler or heat for the heel wrestler.

Another variation of the Flag match can be a regular Interpromotion match between two wrestlers, each usually representing a different wrestling promotion, fighting for the right to raise the flag of their respected promotion. This variation was only used at ECW&#x27;s November to Remember 1997 in a match between Rob Van Dam (representing WWE) vs. Tommy Dreamer (representing ECW) which ended in a no-contest.

==Handicap match==
A handicap match is any match pitting one wrestler or team of wrestlers against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority, such as two against one or three against two. Normally the babyfaces are outnumbered with the heels having more members on their team to provide an unfair advantage. In some two-on-one handicap matches, the team with superior numbers act under tag team rules, with one person in the ring at a time. In others, such as tornado tag team handicap matches, all competitors are in the ring at the same time. In the 1980s and 1990s, handicap matches were used in preliminary matches involving large star wrestlers (usually heels), such as King Kong Bundy, Big Van Vader or Yokozuna, who – as a way to get a monster heel persona/gimmick over with the crowd – would completely dominate their opponents despite the latter&#x27;s superiority in numbers.

==Hardcore-based variations==

Hardcore wrestling, the most violent and bloody type of professional wrestling, is a subset in which some or all of the traditional rules do not apply. Most often this simply means there are no-disqualifications, which itself eliminates countouts, sometimes allowing decisions to take place anywhere. Most hardcore matches or deathmatches often have a combination of match types within one, and elaborate titles are often used, particularly in Japanese wrestling promotions. (example: &quot;Barbed Wire Rope, Exploding Barbed Wire Boards and Exploding Ring Time Bomb Deathmatch&quot;)

Some promotions, such as Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, the International Wrestling Association of Japan, International Wrestling Syndicate, Extreme Championship Wrestling, Big Japan Pro Wrestling, and Combat Zone Wrestling, have specialized in hardcore matches, with &quot;standard&quot; non-hardcore matches being the exception.

===Hardcore match===
A standard hardcore match, also known as a Devil&#x27;s Playground match, a Belfast Brawl match or a Guerrilla Warfare match is a no-disqualification, no-countout, falls count anywhere, one-fall match where the only rule (unless specifically noted) is to achieve a fall by pinning the opponent for a 3-count or making them submit. Otherwise, anything goes: any weapon can be used, any amount of wrestlers who are not booked in the match can be involved, either wrestler booked in the match can be pinned anywhere and any move can be used (except moves banned by the promotion booking the match before-hand). Hardcore matches came to prominence in Japan in the 1970s, and then in the United States in the 1990s in promotions like ECW and later WWE. Blunt objects such as steel chairs, wooden event tables, ladders, wrestling ring stairs, kendo sticks, baseball bats, flour, metal cylindrical trashcans, trashcan lids and road signs are often featured in hardcore matches.

Other common euphemisms for hardcore matches are the No Holds Barred match (which suggests wrestlers are allowed to use any illegal moves), Street Fight (which suggests wrestlers are to dress in normal street clothes), and World Championship Wrestling used the term Raven&#x27;s rules match for hardcore matches involving the wrestler Raven. They also created their own specific brand of hardcore match, for which bouts were to begin backstage rather than in the ring.

====Unsanctioned match====
A variant of a hardcore match is a non-sanctioned match, unsanctioned match, or lights out match. In addition to the match not having any rules and the objective being achieving a pinfall or submission anywhere, the match is not officially recognized by the promotion (such as in All Elite Wrestling, where the match does not count towards a wrestler&#x27;s win–loss record). In kayfabe, the match is sometimes used when a wrestler is &quot;injured&quot; (at the hands of another wrestler) and wants revenge but cannot be &quot;medically cleared&quot;, thus he agrees to a non-sanctioned match where &quot;the promotion is not held liable&quot; for any injuries incurred during the match.

===Deathmatch===
A more extreme version of a hardcore match, a deathmatch is even more violent and bloody. In addition to the blunt weapons and thumbtacks familiar to hardcore matches, deathmatches often include more dangerous elements, such as bricks, nails, staple guns, explosives, barbed wire, light tubes, glass shards, gardening tools (from trowels to weed whackers), and even fire produced from lighter fluid or gasoline. Other euphemisms for deathmatch include extreme rules match, ultraviolent rules match (hardcore rules matches exclusively in CZW), and HardKore X-Treme match.

===Barbed Wire Ring Rope match===

A barbed wire ring rope match or no rope barbed wire match is a hardcore match where the ring ropes are replaced with barbed wire. There are four known ways to prop up barbed wire in place of ring ropes: with three strands of barbed wire run from turnbuckle to turnbuckle; with five strands of wire tied to form an &quot;X&quot;; &quot;spider net&quot;, where the ring ropes are not replaced and barbed wire is wrapped up and down the ropes to create a wall of barbed wire, and finally barbed wire wrapped in the &quot;X&quot; fashion- that has been electrified or rigged with explosives. These types of matches were made popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s by American territory wrestling promotions, as well as Japanese promotions during the 1990s. These types of matches often included other stipulations and weapons in them.

====Barbed Wire Massacre====
A Barbed Wire Massacre is a type of barbed wire rope match where the barbed wire ropes are set up in the &quot;X&quot; fashion and the use of additional items that have barbed wire attached to or wrapped around them are made available, such as plywood, baseball bats, steel folding chairs and other weapons. This match originated in TNA in 2005. Since then, there have been five such matches, the most recent in 2022. However, unlike the first three Barbed Wire Massacre matches, the fourth did not replace the ring ropes. The Japanese Barbed Wire Massacre is a variation in which there are wooden boards covered with barbed wire, and a small charge goes off when someone lands on one.

===Bath House Deathmatch===
The Bath House Deathmatch was believed to have been started by IWA Japan in 1995. The wrestlers compete in the pool of a public bathhouse, with even naked or toweled women in this bath house during this match. Besides regular wrestling rules, if they leave the pool, they are disqualified. The pool is heated by a fire that is regularly fed more logs, making staying in it harder and harder.

===Caribbean Barbed Wire Deathmatch===
The Caribbean Barbed Wire Deathmatch is a hardcore match where barbed wire is wrapped around the ring ropes in &quot;spidernet&quot; fashion on two sides, and on the other two sides are barricaded traps on ground level situated right next to the ring. These elaborate traps are wooden structures featuring multiple strands of barbed wire strung from short adjacent wooden poles covered by panes of glass, with a thick wooden board below as foundation for the entire trap. The wooden poles stand 18 inches high on one side, and two feet on the other side. This match was featured in the W*ING hardcore wrestling promotion in Japan and was first done in 1993.

===Circus Deathmatch===
A Circus Deathmatch is a type of scaffold match where in the ring is a scaffold and under that scaffold, there is a type of spider net made of barbed wire six feet below. The first wrestler to fall off of the scaffold into the barbed wire spider net loses. The first match was between Mad Man Pondo and Ryuji Ito in Japan.

===Clockwork Orange House of Fun match===
The Clockwork Orange House of Fun match, known as &quot;Raven&#x27;s House of Fun&quot; or simply &quot;House of Fun&quot;, was created by professional wrestler Raven (legitimately, as Raven pitched the idea himself to TNA&#x27;s creative team). It is a singles match for which poles attached to the ring posts measured about five to six feet above the turnbuckles, with single chains wrapped from and hanging on the poles to various points on the ring itself with many weapons hanging from and attached to steel chains above the ring, sometimes with sides of a steel cage attached to and erected on the ring. In the first match the use of weapons is legal, and the only way to win was to put an opponent through two tables after throwing them off &quot;Raven&#x27;s perch&quot; (a small scaffold), but afterwards it was changed to falls-count-anywhere rules.

===Electric Pool match===
In an Electric Pool match, the ring is placed in a large pool of water, with no ropes on two sides of the ring, and exploding barbed wire on the other two sides of the ring. Wrestlers were transported to the ring via a dinghy, and the ring was put on a floating device, then it was surrounded by four metal barricades. There was a current running through these four barricades (which were essentially small sections of the pool enclosed off from the rest of the pool), enabling the water to &quot;explode&quot; when a wrestler was thrown into one of these barricaded areas. Considering the danger involved in allowing a current to run through water, this match was only used once in FMW in 1994, which was known for its extreme hardcore matches.

===Explosion/Bomb Deathmatch===
The Explosion or Bomb Deathmatch is usually accompanied with barbed wire ropes, a large barbed wire wrapped explosion board is placed in the ring laced with a small amount of C-4. The match can be won by either a pinfall or a submission, or in other versions of the match, by blowing up the eventual loser. In some versions of the C-4 match is to finish the match before the timer runs out and detonates the ring (although this does not necessarily end the match) while in others the explosives are concentrated in a specific area, with the wrestlers struggling not to get pushed onto it. Almost all of these matches so far have been done in Japan in promotions with larger budgets.

====Anus Explosion Deathmatch ====
An Anus Explosion Deathmatch is a hardcore match where the only way to win is to stick a firecracker up an opponent&#x27;s buttocks and light it. Once the firecracker goes off while lodged inside an incapacitated wrestler&#x27;s buttocks, the match ends. This match was only done once, by Japanese hardcore wrestling promotion Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling in October 1999, where Mr. Gannosuke faced off against Hayabusa.

====Double Hell Deathmatch====
A Double Hell Deathmatch is a hardcore match where exploding (or non-exploding) barbed wire is put up at two sides of the ring in place of ropes, and the other two are left with nothing. However, at ringside on the empty sides, there are huge boards laden with barbed wire and landmines/explosives (and sometimes glass). This makes it a lot easier for a participant to fall out of the ring.

====Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch====
AEW&#x27;s variation is an Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch which is a combination of an Explosion Deathmatch, Barbed Wire Ring Rope match, Double Hell Deathmatch, and Time Bomb Deathmatch. There was three sides of barbed wire ring ropes with explosives triggered upon contact, three zones around the ringside floor wired to explosives (Triple Hell), and a 30-minute countdown timer until all explosives in and around the ring detonate. The match was contested between Kenny Omega and Jon Moxley for the AEW World Championship at Revolution, which Omega won.

The concept was planned to be used in the WWE but according to Court Bauer in November 2022, Vince McMahon had once accepted an idea for an Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch. This stipulation did not appear at all but it would later appear in a form of a Punjabi Prison Match which debuted at The Great American Bash in 2006.

====Landmine Deathmatch====
A Landmine Deathmatch is a hardcore match where explosives are set up at ringside, usually laced with barbed wire. This match was first done with FMW in Japan in the mid-1990s.

====Time Bomb Deathmatch====
A Time Bomb Deathmatch is a type of deathmatch where explosives or fireworks set up around the ring are set off after an allotted time. This match originated in Japan and was done various times in the 1990s. Mick Foley and Terry Funk participated in a &quot;Barbed Wire Rope, Exploding Barbed Wire Boards and Exploding Ring Time Bomb Deathmatch&quot; as the final match of the 1995 Kawasaki Dream King of the Deathmatch tournament, where there were multiple plywood boards with barbed wire and explosives attached to them strewn around the ring.

====Time Bomb Exploding Cage Deathmatch====
A Time Bomb Exploding Cage Deathmatch is a mixture of a Steel Cage match and a Time Bomb Deathmatch, where every square foot of a steel cage is wrapped in barbed wire and explosives set up around the ring go off after a set time, and five minutes before the explosion a loud siren is activated. The match, unlike a traditional steel cage match is a one-fall match and victory cannot be achieved via escaping the cage, which, if attempted would be very painful and difficult. This match also originated in Japan in the early 1990s.

===Eye for an Eye match===
An Eye for an Eye match is a hardcore match that could only be won when one competitor &quot;extracts&quot; an eyeball out of the socket of their opponent. This match only occurred once, between Rey Mysterio and Seth Rollins at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules. In it, Rollins shoved Mysterio&#x27;s eye into the corner of the steel steps, causing the eyeball to pop out and giving Rollins the victory.

===Falls Count Anywhere match===
A falls count anywhere match allows pinfalls to take place in any location, negating the standard rule that they must take place inside the ring and between the ropes, and these matches largely take place outside of the ring. Submissions may or may not also be covered by this rule. This also eliminates the usual &quot;countout&quot; rule. A variation of the rules states that once a pinfall takes place, the pinned wrestler loses the match if they are unable to return to the ring within a specific amount of time – usually a referee&#x27;s count of 10 or 30. If the pinned wrestler makes it to the ring in this time, the match continues. Occasionally, this stipulation is listed as having a specific territory in which falls count (e.g. the state, county, or general location the match is in). As the match may take place in various parts of the arena, the &quot;falls count anywhere&quot; provision is almost always accompanied with a &quot;no-disqualification&quot; stipulation to make the match a hardcore match, so as to allow wrestlers the convenience to use any objects they may find wherever they wrestle.

===First Blood match===
A First Blood match is a no-disqualification, no-submission, no-fall, no-countout match in which the first wrestler to bleed anywhere loses the match. Depending on the nuance of the stipulation, this might include bleeding noses. Although there are no-disqualifications, outside interference cannot be seen causing the participant to bleed. The first televised First Blood match was Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kane at King of the Ring 1998. This type of match became rare in the WWE since 2008 in which blood is rarely shown in its programming to adhere with the TV-PG standards. The most recent first blood match was John Cena vs. JBL at One Night Stand in 2008.

====Doomsday Chamber of Blood match====
A Doomsday Chamber of Blood match, created by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, is a First Blood match that takes place inside of a barbed wire topped cage.

====Sadistic Madness match====
A Sadistic Madness match, created by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, is another variation of the First Blood match, the main difference being that the opponent must be bleeding before a wrestler can legally pin them.

===Four Corners of Pain match===
A Four Corners of Pain match is a hardcore match where in each corner of the ring, there is a container that has a weapon or another type of harmful item. This match originated at the 2003 Combat Zone Wrestling Tournament of Death II, and at the 2006 IWA-MS Queen of the Deathmatch, Amy Lee took on Sexxxy Eddy in this match.

====Pools of Fuckery Deathmatch====
A Pools of Fuckery Deathmatch is similar to a Four Corners of Pain match, only the harmful items in each corner are in small plastic pools. This match originated in March 2021 in the independent wrestling promotion Asylum Wrestling Revolution (AMR), where Mickie Knuckles faced Akira.

===Good Old Fashioned Donnybrook match===
A Good Old Fashioned Donnybrook match is a no disqualification hardcore match where large wood barrels of Irish brandy and canes are made available at ringside. The first match of its kind was on the July 29, 2022 episode of WWE SmackDown between Sheamus and Drew McIntyre, which McIntyre won. A tag team version later took place during WWE&#x27;s 2022 edition of its Extreme Rules pay-per-view between The Brawling Brutes and Imperium, which was won by The Brawling Brutes. This is Sheamus&#x27; signature match.

===Hard Ten match===
The Hard Ten match is a hardcore match that was created by TNA/Impact Wrestling. It is contested on a points system, in which the points are earned for the use of weapons. The first wrestler to earn ten points and be at least two points ahead is the winner. Regular strikes with a weapon are worth one point, while putting an opponent through a table is worth five points. This match type happened only once in TNA history.

===Last Man/Woman Standing match===

A last man standing match (or last woman standing) is a hardcore-style match in which the only way to win is by count out via standing, and a wrestler can be counted out anywhere. A wrestler will lose the match if they are unable to answer a ten-count after being downed, similar to the knockout rules of a boxing match. To avoid losing, the downed wrestler must be on their feet by the count of 10, but they can not lose by leaving the ring for 10-count (ring out) if they are still on his feet while recovering. Because of the hardcore nature of the match restraining a downed opponent is a permissible way to ensure that they do not respond to the ten-count, even if they would otherwise be able to.

====Baseball Brawl match====
A Baseball Brawl match or Brawl Game match is variant of a Last Man Standing match where baseball bats are initially banned, but if a wrestler is counted out by 10, then baseball bats for the wrestler or team that got the count-out automatically become legal, and the match converts over to a standard hardcore match where victory is achieved by either pinfalls, submissions or count outs. This match was first done at ECW&#x27;s Hardcore Heaven in August 1994, and was known as the signature match of The Public Enemy tag team.

====Texas Deathmatch====

A variant of the Last Man Standing match is the Texas Deathmatch (a.k.a. Mexican Deathmatch, or Armageddon Rules match), in which a wrestler must be pinned to a 3-count or made to submit/rendered unconscious before the referee will begin the ten-count. Some of these matches have been known to last for hours, including one that Dory Funk Jr. participated in that went on for more than four hours. This match was often done by Dory and his brother Terry Funk in the 1960s in their father Dory Sr.&#x27;s promotion Western States Sports.

===Light Tube Deathmatch===
A light tube match is a hardcore match where hundreds (usually 200) of long, cylindrical, glass fluorescent light tubes are attached to the ring ropes (usually via tape), and mock shaped weapons and mock large objects made of light tubes are made available. These matches often end with most or all of the light tubes broken or shattered; these matches are some of the bloodiest, most gruesome and most dangerous types of wrestling matches because the glass in a light tube contains poisonous and carcinogenic chemicals, and when broken, the poisonous and carcinogenic dust from the shattered glass gets into the air and allows audience members, the referee and the wrestlers to breathe it in. Another hazard of this match is shards of broken glass still rife with dangerous chemicals laying around the ring mat and sticking in the wrestlers&#x27; bodies (when they are slammed onto the wrestling mat); in more organized wrestling promotions, attendants briefly enter the ring and quickly sweep the broken glass off the mat. This type of match originated in Japan in the late 1990s and early 2000s in Big Japan Pro Wrestling, and some independent promotions in the United States feature this type of match.

====2/3 Light Tube Log cabins Deathmatch====
A 2/3 Light Tube Log Cabins Deathmatch is a hardcore match where the only way to win is to break two shaped light tube weapons over and/or on an opponent. Combat Zone Wrestling has used this match in their Tournament of Death series.

===Monster&#x27;s Ball match===
A Monster&#x27;s Ball match is a match invented and staged by TNA Wrestling. The key premise of the match was that all contenders are sequestered alone in a locked room without light, food or water for 24 hours before the match. This stipulation is intended to induce extreme feelings of aggression in the competitors. Once released, the wrestlers fight one another in a hardcore match, with the usage of weapons encouraged. Victory can be achieved by pinfall or submission, with the match ending as soon as one wrestler is pinned or submits.

The Monster&#x27;s Ball match typically features numerous high spots. There have been 54 matches taking place under TNA, as well as several unaffiliated independent promotions hosting the match. The match has almost always featured Abyss in some capacity, wrestling in 48 and managing in one, as it is his signature match. There are various weapons frequently used in the match, including thumbtacks, &quot;Janice&quot; (a board filled with nails, Abyss&#x27;s signature weapon), and a bed of barbed wire.

===No Disqualification match ===
A No Disqualification match, also known as a No Holds Barred match, or sometimes as an Anything Goes match, an Extreme Rules match (in WWE, since the establishment of the now-former ECW brand), Tribal Combat and Bloodline Rules (in WWE, for wrestlers in the Anoaʻi family) or a No Ropes Catch Wrestling match (in MLW), is a match in which neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. However, unlike a hardcore match pinfalls and submissions must be made inside the ring.

No-disqualification matches may be used in feuds in which a challenger may have won matches against the champion, but did not claim the championship because the champion was disqualified (championships usually only change hands via pinfall or submission). Unless stipulated, a no-disqualification match can end in a countout. Those that cannot are no-disqualification, no-countout matches, therefore they&#x27;re called no holds barred matches.

===Piranha Deathmatch===
A Piranha Deathmatch or Amazon River Piranha Deathmatch, similar to a Desert Deathmatch is a type of highly dangerous match where a fish tank containing dangerous and flesh-eating Piranha fish is placed in the center of the ring, and the first wrestler who gets put into the tank for 10 seconds loses. There was only one match ever done, and it was at Big Japan Pro Wrestling&#x27;s Summer Night Dream event in Yokohama, Japan in September 1996, where in the main event Kendo Nagasaki put Mitsuhiro Matsunaga in the tank, defeating him.

===Pitch Black match===
A Pitch Black match is a hardcore-based match during which the arena lights are turned off or extremely dimmed, with most of the action visible due to the competitors wearing clothes or body paint that glows in the dark. The only known Pitch Black match, sponsored by Mountain Dew, happened at the 2023 Royal Rumble, with Bray Wyatt defeating LA Knight.

===Razor Deathmatch===
A Razor Deathmatch is an often extremely bloody match where boards full of razor blades are made available as weapons. This match is a trademark of Japanese hardcore wrestler Jun Kasai who has participated in five such contests.

===Spike Nail Deathmatch===
A Spike Nail Deathmatch is a hardcore match where a large bed of six-inch spiked nails sticking out of a rectangular piece of plywood is made available. The most famous example of this kind of match was at the IWA Kawasaki Dream King of the Deathmatch, where Cactus Jack faced Shoji Nakamaki in August 1995. Another type of Spike Nail match was rather than achieving a fall to win, the first wrestler to take a bump on the huge planks of wood infested with six-inch nails at ringside loses.

====Nail Hell Deathmatch====
A Nail Hell Deathmatch is a hardcore match where some boards with nails were hung on the ring ropes all the way across, and onto opposing sides of the ring there was a board, on one side there was nails and on the other side was barbed wire. Only one match like this was done, in December 1994 by IWA Japan.

===Street fight===
A street fight is a type of hardcore match with no disqualifications, in which falls count anywhere, and weapons are legal. The main difference between a hardcore match and a street fight is that while wrestlers wear their normal wrestling gear in hardcore matches, wrestlers (particularly in modern times) almost always wear their own street clothes in street fights, and weapons typically used in street fights are items typically found on or are often used on city streets, such as trash cans, road signs, broomsticks, dumpsters and sometimes vehicles and shopping carts filled with those items, among other things. Sometimes street fights have the name of the host arena&#x27;s city in the name, such as &quot;Chicago Street Fight&quot; or &quot;New York Street Fight&quot;.

==== Bunkhouse match ====
A Bunkhouse match is a type of street fight where wrestlers compete with each other dressed in cowboy clothes or wearing items cowboys wear, such as cowboy boots, leather belts, jeans and ten-gallon cowboy hats. This is named a &quot;Bunkhouse match&quot; because bunkhouses were barracks-like buildings that historically were used to house working cowboys on ranches.

====&quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; Fight====
A &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; Fight is a Christmas-themed variant of a Street Fight, named after the movie Miracle on 34th Street, involving Christmas-themed weapons including fire extinguishers, pumpkin pies, presents, Christmas trees, Christmas wreaths, candy cane themed kendo sticks, bowling balls, and teddy bears, plus common wrestling weapons such as tables and chairs.

====Trick or Street Fight====
A Trick or Street Fight is a Halloween-themed variant of a Street Fight, named after the Halloween tradition &quot;trick or treating&quot;, involving Halloween-themed weapons including pumpkins, buckets of candy, bowls full of water and apples, skeletons, witches&#x27; brooms, gravestones, candy corn themed kendo sticks, plus common wrestling weapons such as tables and chairs.

===Taipei Deathmatch===
A Taipei Deathmatch, (also known as an Ancient Way Deathmatch) is a very bloody and violent hardcore match where the wrestlers&#x27; fists are taped and dipped into glue or honey, and then into broken and crushed glass, allowing shards to stick to their fists. Win by pinfall, submission or escape. It is unknown why this match is named after the capital city of Taiwan; the first time this match was ever held was at ECW&#x27;s Hardcore Heaven in July 1995 where the Rotten brothers, Axl and Ian, faced off in this match, and it was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, not in Taipei.

===Thumbtack Deathmatch===
A Thumbtack Deathmatch is a hardcore match where one or more trays containing thousands (usually 10,000) of thumbtacks is/are made available and usually placed in either the center or apron of the ring. The most well-known version of this match was at the IWA Kawasaki Dream King of the Deathmatch, where Terry Gordy faced Cactus Jack in August 1995. Variants of the thumbtack deathmatch staged by TNA/Impact Wrestling have been done where the objective is modified to simply slam an opponent into the pile of thumbtacks on the mat.
A variation of this match is a cross between a Ladder Match and 10,000 Thumbtacks Match called a Thumbtacks Ladder match in which a ladder is placed in the ring with a reward at the top. Thumbtacks are also spread out across the ring. A variant of the 10,000 thumbtacks deathmatch is the East Coast Thumbtack match, this match has 177,000 thumbtacks placed in the ring. The first match was introduced between Ian Rotten and The Messiah.

====Barefoot Thumbtack match====
A Barefoot Thumbtack match is a hardcore match where both wrestlers have bare feet, and there is a large container containing thousands of thumbtacks in the middle of the ring that are legal to use it. Originated in Big Japan Pro Wrestling.

====Thumbtack Balloons match====
Big Japan Pro Wrestling staged a &#x27;Thumbtacks In Balloons&#x27; match on 5/22/96. The match, which saw Axl Rotten and Shoji Nakamaki lock up with Kendo Nagasaki and Seiji Yamakawa, had six black balloons suspended above the ring. At a certain point in the match, the balloons exploded and released 30,000 thumbtacks onto the ring.

===Unlucky 13 Deathmatch===
An Unlucky 13 Deathmatch is a hardcore match invented by Ian Rotten. In order to win the match, a wrestler must staple seven out of thirteen one dollar bills to their opponent&#x27;s mouth.

==Location-based variations==
Though most matches take place in and around the ring, some are designed specifically for more exotic locales. The majority of these matches take on the name of their setting, often appending &quot;brawl&quot; to the end, and all of them are hardcore by definition. The following is a list of locale-based variations that supplant or replace the standard rules.

===Bar Room Brawl===
A Bar Room Brawl is a multi-competitor no disqualification match held in a bar. During the match wrestlers are encouraged to drink while fighting, and the &quot;last man standing&quot; is declared winner. Wrestlers can be eliminated from the match both by the standard pinfall, submission, or by simply becoming too (kayfabe) drunk to continue the match. A known example of this match is the APA Invitational Bar Room Brawl at Vengeance 2003 which Bradshaw won after knocking down Brother Love. Another example, a Bar Fight was done in 2020, with Jeff Hardy facing off against Sheamus.

===Boiler Room Brawl===
A Boiler Room Brawl or Boiler Room match starts in a boiler room, with the winner being the first wrestler to successfully get out. This match is a no-disqualification, no-falls, no-countout match, so anything goes, so long as someone escapes first. The rather hazardous environment of this match featured some of the arena&#x27;s internal infrastructure, such as all sorts of large, exposed metal piping with large bolts, concrete flooring and solid electrical equipment everywhere, among other features. Mick Foley participated in all of the WWF-run Boiler Room Brawls under his persona Mankind, because this persona dwelled in boiler rooms, hence this being Mankind&#x27;s signature match. The first Boiler Room Brawl happened at SummerSlam 1996 with Mankind vs. The Undertaker, where in addition to escaping the boiler room the combatant had to make his way to the ring and grab Paul Bearer&#x27;s urn; but when the next Boiler Room Brawl was contested at Backlash 1999 with Mankind against The Big Show, the objective was simplified to just escaping the boiler room first. World Championship Wrestling used a match with similar rules, naming their match and its location the Block.

===Body of Water match===
A Body of Water match is a hardcore match where the sole objective is to get your opponent into a large body of water. This match was only done once, where CM Punk faced Chavo Guerrero during an ECW show in Corpus Christi, Texas (which is located right on the Gulf of Mexico, the body of water used) in February 2008.

===Dungeon match===
A Dungeon match is a hardcore match that took place in the legendary Hart Family Dungeon in Calgary, where Owen Hart challenged Ken Shamrock to come to the Dungeon (referred to as Hart&#x27;s &quot;basement&quot;) for a fight. The match can only be won by submission.

===Empty Arena match===
An empty arena match is a hardcore (no disqualification, falls count anywhere) &quot;anything goes&quot; match between two or more wrestlers that takes place in an arena or stadium that although is fully set up for a wrestling event, is devoid of fans. The only people present are the competitors, referee, commentators, and cameramen. The match is broadcast, or videotaped and played later. An example of this is the WWF championship match between The Rock and Mankind that took place in Tucson, Arizona, at the Tucson Convention Center, which aired as part of a special Halftime Heat edition of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; aired against the Super Bowl halftime show of Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999. One of the earliest and best known empty arena matches occurred in 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee, at the Mid-South Coliseum between Jerry Lawler and Terry Funk.

A lack of audience that is a legitimate aspect of the production and not a kayfabe stipulation of the match (i.e. the match is conducted normally, except a live audience is not present) is not necessarily considered an empty arena match. For example, audiences were barred from attending televised AEW, and later WWE, shows in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Parking Lot Brawl===
A Parking Lot Brawl is a Falls Count Anywhere match that is usually fought in an interior location or in an outside parking lot around a tightly parked circle of cars. The first wrestler to score a pinfall, submission, or knockout in a Parking Lot Brawl is the winner. Both wrestlers are allowed to use everything around them as weapons, including the cars. The first Parking Lot Brawl was between Jerry Lawler and Eddie Gilbert in Memphis, Tennessee in 1988, which was fought all over the arena and its outside parking lot. More well-known examples of a Parking Lot Brawl both involved John Cena, where he faced Eddie Guerrero in 2003 and JBL in 2008.

====Hollywood Backlot Brawl====
A Hollywood Backlot Brawl was a no-disqualification match that started in a Hollywood studio backlot, and it was fought between Goldust and Roddy Piper. This match also involved the two performers actually driving cars for a long period of time, and then ended with the two arriving in the Honda Center in Anaheim 30 miles away to finish their match in the ring.

====Iron Circle match====
An Iron Circle match is a type of Parking Lot Brawl that is fought specifically in a parking garage around a rowdy live audience sitting on the cars encircling the competitors. An Iron Circle match was a falls count anywhere match where Ken Shamrock fought Steve Blackman at WWF Fully Loaded 1999.

====Train match====
A Train match is a Falls Count Anywhere match fought in a moving train. All weapons are legal, and there is no disqualification (except for damage to the train). This happened in 2023 by CyberFight&#x27;s DDT Pro Wrestling promotion, where Sanshiro Takagi competed against Minoru Suzuki on the Shinkansen TGV from Tokyo to Nagoya, with speeds exceeding 170 MPH on the train.

===Tooth and Nail match===
A Tooth and Nail match is a Falls Count Anywhere-stipulation match that is fought in and around a dental office, and any weapon is legal. This is Britt Baker&#x27;s speciality match, based on her role as a dentist in both kayfabe and off-screen reality, and the objective of this match is to achieve a pinfall, submission or countout.

==Lumberjack match==

A lumberjack match is a standard match with the exception that the ring is surrounded by a group of wrestlers not directly involved in it. These wrestlers, known collectively as lumberjacks (female wrestlers serving in this manner are sometimes called lumberjills; lumberjack matches between female wrestlers are called lumberjill matches, a play on the famous Nursery Rhyme, &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;), are there to prevent the wrestlers in the match from getting out of the ring. The groups of lumberjacks are typically split up into groups of faces and heels who occupy opposing sides around the ring. Usually, the &quot;opposing&quot; lumberjacks (that is, face lumberjacks if the wrestler is a heel, and vice versa) swarm the wrestlers if they leave the ring and force them back in it. Occasional interference from the lumberjacks is common, as is an all-out brawl on the outside involving most of the lumberjacks. Early lumberjack matches even featured the lumberjacks wearing stereotypical lumberjack clothing in keeping with the lumberjack theme, though this is generally no longer done. A common theme is for the lumberjacks to consist entirely of heel wrestlers to stack the odds against the face competitor. The Lumberjill Snowbunny match is another variation of the Lumberjill match with female lumberjacks, held in a pit of snow.

===Canadian Lumberjack match===
In a &quot;Canadian&quot; lumberjack match, the lumberjacks are equipped with leather straps. TNA&#x27;s &quot;fan&#x27;s revenge&quot; match was their own version of a Canadian lumberjack match, where fans equipped with straps act as lumberjacks and were encouraged to whip wrestlers. A similar &quot;fans&#x27; revenge&quot; variation was used in Lucha Underground where it was called a Believers&#x27; Backlash match (&quot;Believers&quot; was the nickname for fans of the series).

===Extreme Lumberjack match===
The Extreme Lumberjack match is a lumberjack match competed under hardcore rules, where there are no disqualifications, no countouts, and falls count anywhere.

==Multi-competitor-based variations==
On some occasions, a match may be held between more than two individual wrestlers or teams. Multi-competitor matches are often broken down to eliminations and non-eliminations.

=== Basic non-elimination matches ===
==== Non-elimination matches with three competitors ====
The most common example of a non-elimination match is the Three-Way match (also known as a Triple Threat match in WWE, Triangle match in WCW and Three-Way Dance in ECW), in which three wrestlers compete under standard rules with the first competitor to achieve a pinfall or submission being declared the winner. Triple Threat matches are fought under no-disqualification and no-countout stipulations. Triangle matches are often contested like a tag match where only two can be in the match at one time while the third waits on the ring apron and the only elimination factor is if a competitor is disqualified.

==== Non-elimination matches with four or more competitors ====

In many promotions, there are typically no distinctions between the two terms. Non-elimination variations are the Four-Way match (known as a Fatal Four-Way in WWE, Four Corners match in WCW and Four-Way Dance in ECW), the Five-Way match (known as a Fatal Five-Way in WWE) or the Six-Way match (known as the Six-Pack Challenge in WWE), involving four, five, or six wrestlers, respectively.
 American independent promotion USA Xtreme Wrestling hosted a match involving 8–12 competitors known as the 8 Ball Challenge. These types of matches can be used in certain situations to take a title off a wrestler without weakening him in the process.

On some occasions, multi-competitor matches are contested under similar rules as a tag team match. Two competitors start the match in the ring while the other wrestler(s) wait outside the ring for a tag from another wrestler, often achieved by touching an unsuspecting competitor in the ring. Variations of this include a Four Corners Survival match or Six-Man Mayhem match in Ring of Honor. Competitors are permitted to leave their position and attack wrestlers outside of the ring, such as when one or both wrestlers have been thrown over the top rope.

=== Basic elimination matches ===
Matches involving a larger number of competitors are typically elimination matches. These matches may begin with all of the competitors in the ring at the same time. The standard match rules apply as wrestlers may leave the position and attack other wrestlers outside the ring with a twist that the wrestler be pinned or forced to submit is eliminated from the match.

====Elimination matches with three competitors====

The most common example of an elimination match is the Three-Way Dance, where the first fall would eliminate one wrestler, reducing the match to a standard one-fall singles match. The Three-Way Dance was a specialty of Extreme Championship Wrestling.

====Elimination matches with four or more competitors====
A Four-Way Dance is similar except it involves four wrestlers in Extreme Championship Wrestling and some promotions use a tag format for the match instead of having all the wrestlers in the ring at the same time. Elimination variations are the Four-Way match (known as a Fatal Four-Way in WWE), the Five-Way match (known as a Fatal Five-Way in WWE) or the Six-Way match (known as the Six-Pack Challenge in WWE), involving four, five, or six wrestlers inside the ring, respectively.

The Deadly Draw match is a TNA variation where four competitors wrestle. The match begins with two competitors in the ring. After five minutes pass, the third competitor enters the ring, then after another five minutes pass, the fourth competitor enters the ring. Any wrestler who gets pinned or force to submit is eliminated, and any wrestler in the ring not involved in the fall is also eliminated. The last man standing wins.

=== Beat the Clock Challenge ===
A Beat the Clock challenge is a multi-competitor match in which wrestlers must defeat their opponent in a singles match before the clock runs out. Additionally, the next wrestler must beat the winner&#x27;s set time by defeating their opponent to advance, otherwise that wrestler is eliminated. In doing so, the victorious wrestler usually gets some type of reward in return, such as inclusion in a title match, for instance. In a variation on the November 20, 2013 episode of NXT, two wrestlers completed a match, with the match duration being used as the marker for two other wrestlers to complete their match. The first ever Divas Beat the Clock challenge occurred in the August 2015 episode of Raw when Paige, Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair faced a different competitor to earn a WWE Divas Championship match against Nikki Bella at Night of Champions.

=== Championship Scramble ===
WWE features a match called the Championship Scramble in which none of the wrestlers are eliminated. Two wrestlers start the match and every five minutes another wrestler enters until all five participants are present. After the last wrestler enters, there is a predetermined time limit. Each time a wrestler scores a pinfall or submission, he becomes the interim champion. Such reigns are not recorded as title reigns. The winner is the wrestler who scores the last pinfall or submission before the time limit expires. The Unforgiven pay-per view of 2008 is arguably the most prominent showcase of this match type, as all three world titles were contested under a Championship Scramble match.

=== Elimination Chase ===
The Elimination Chase, first used in WWE&#x27;s version of ECW brand in 2007, is a series of multi-competitor, one fall matches, with the loser of the fall being eliminated from future matches until one competitor remains.

=== Iron Survivor Challenge ===
WWE&#x27;s NXT brand features a match called the Iron Survivor Challenge at its annual December event Deadline, in which none of the wrestlers are eliminated. There is one each for the men and women. The rules are as follows:

*Five wrestlers compete in the match, which lasts 25 minutes.
*Two wrestlers start the match, which begins the timer, and every five minutes, another wrestler enters with the fifth and final participant entering at the 15-minute mark.
*Each time a wrestler scores a pinfall, submission, or being the victim of a disqualification, they gain a point. Points can be gained even before other participants have entered.
*A wrestler who is pinned, submitted, or is disqualified goes into a penalty box for 90 seconds, after which they can re-enter the match.
*The winner of the match, dubbed the Iron Survivor, is the wrestler who scores the most points at the end of the 25-minute time limit. In the result of a tie, those who are tied enter sudden death overtime.
*The winners of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s matches earn a future match for the NXT Championship and NXT Women&#x27;s Championship, respectively.

The Iron Survivor Challenge combines elements of the Championship Scramble, Iron Man, and TNA Wrestling&#x27;s King of the Mountain matches. It was used for the first time at Deadline in 2022.

===Special Guest Referee===
The Special Guest Referee is any match in which the usual referee is replaced with a &quot;guest&quot; filling in as the official. Celebrities (such as Muhammad Ali in the main event of WrestleMania I), managers and other wrestlers can &quot;guest&quot; as the special referee. In some cases, a special referee is put into a match which is already a different match type or stipulation. The special referee will often be biased towards or against one of the competitors or will be assigned as the Special Referee to ensure the match is called down the line. Special Outside Referee
also known as Special Enforcer or Special Guest Enforcer is same as the Special Referee but the guest referee stays on the outside enforcing what the normal referee doesn&#x27;t see. These guests are sometimes known as &quot;enforcers&quot;, the most famous of which was Mike Tyson, who served as the Special Guest Enforcer for the WWF title match between Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XIV, and Chuck Norris who served as Special Guest Enforcer at Survivor Series 1994 in a match between The Undertaker and Yokozuna. Another example of this is Triple H vs. The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania 28 with Shawn Michaels being the Special Guest Referee.

== Non-wrestling matches ==
Occasionally, a match would take place under the rules of a different type of contest. Like professional wrestling matches, the matches would be worked, with the participants not being in the perceived danger and the winner being predetermined.

=== Arm Wrestling match ===
An arm wrestling match, in the context of professional wrestling, is a basic arm wrestling contest. It can be contested between two females, two males or between one male and one female. Often the male in the latter will be a manager going against the wrestler of a competitor.

=== Boxing match ===
The professional wrestling version of a boxing match has standard boxing rules applied to it. Wrestlers wear boxing gloves and the match is contested in rounds with fouls given out, though the matches are generally worked and end with one wrestler cheating and using wrestling maneuvers.

=== Mixed Martial Arts match ===
The professional wrestling version of a mixed martial arts (MMA) match under standard MMA. As in MMA, pinfalls are not a valid method of victory. Matches can typically only be won by knockout, submission, disqualification, forfeit or by going to a referee&#x27;s decision.

=== Sumo match ===
For a sumo match, the ropes are removed from the ring and standard sumo rules apply. The first person to step outside of the ring or touch the mat with any part of the body except the soles of the feet is the loser. The most infamous match of this kind in WWE happened at WrestleMania 21 between The Big Show and Sumo legend, Akebono.

===Sumo Monster Truck match===
A Sumo Monster Truck match is a regular tug-o-war contest where two wrestlers are driving monster trucks, pushing and shoving each other. An example of this match type is at the Halloween Havoc (1995) pay-per-view between Hulk Hogan and The Giant.

==Rumble rules-based variations==
In this version – unlike traditional battle royales where all the wrestlers begin the match in the ring – the competitors (after numbers 1 and 2 begin the match) enter at timed intervals in accordance with the number that they have drawn until the entire field has entered.

=== Aztec Warfare ===
Aztec Warfare is the Lucha Underground version of the &quot;Rumble Rules&quot; battle royale. Upwards to 20 participants enter every 90 seconds and elimination occurs by either pinfall or submission and has to take place inside the ring. There are no count-outs and no disqualifications. , four Aztec Warfare matches have occurred—one in each season of Lucha Underground.

===Battle Riot===

The Battle Riot is Major League Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Rumble&quot; style battle royale. This match isn&#x27;t that much different from other Pin, Submission &amp; Over the top rope elimination rumble rules, however is different from the WWE Royal Rumble, of which you can only get eliminated via going over the top rope with both feet hitting the floor.

===Casino Battle Royale===

The Casino Battle Royale is used by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It is a modified rumble rules battle royale that features 21 entrants. It begins with a group of five wrestlers, and every three minutes, another group of five wrestlers enter, while the 21st and final entrant enters alone. The wrestlers are grouped based on the suit they drew from a deck of cards – spades, diamonds, clubs, or hearts – and the order of when each group enters is based on a random draw of the cards. The 21st and final entrant is the wrestler who drew the joker. The winner receives a world championship match of their respective gender&#x27;s division—either the AEW World Championship or the AEW Women&#x27;s World Championship.

The first Casino Battle Royale occurred during the pre-show of AEW&#x27;s inaugural event, Double or Nothing in 2019, and was a men&#x27;s match. The winner of the inaugural match was entered into the match to determine the inaugural AEW World Champion at All Out that year. The second Casino Battle Royale was an all-female version and was held during the pre-show of the aforementioned All Out event. Like the first, the winner of this second iteration was entered into the match to determine the inaugural AEW Women&#x27;s World Champion on the debut episode of AEW&#x27;s weekly television show, &quot;Dynamite&quot;. The third Casino Battle Royale—a men&#x27;s match—took place at All Out in 2020 and the winner received a future AEW World Championship match.

===Honor Rumble===
Ring of Honor (ROH) also periodically features the &quot;Rumble&quot; style of battle royale on their shows, billing it as the Honor Rumble. This battle royal differs from a standard version of the match in that the contestants do not all begin in the ring at the same time, but instead enter the match at timed intervals in order of their assigned entry numbers (comparable in style to WWE&#x27;s Royal Rumble match). Numbers are usually drawn through a lottery that is typically staged right before the event begins, although participants can also win desirable spots via a number of other means, the most common being winning a match.

===New Japan Rumble===
New Japan Pro-Wrestling&#x27;s annual &quot;Rumble&quot; battle royale, takes place on the pre-show of Wrestle Kingdom on January 4. Participants enter at one minute intervals and are eliminated via pinfall, submission or by being thrown over the top rope. Typically leaning towards light comedy, the match includes past stars as surprise entrants.

===Royal Rampage===
Used by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) on its program &quot;Rampage&quot;. The Royal Rampage is a two ring rumble rules battle royale. It features 20 wrestlers between the two rings (10 in each). It begins with two wrestlers in each ring, with two new wrestlers entering at timed intervals - one in the red ring and one in the blue ring (as differentiated by the color of the ropes). After all 20 wrestlers have entered, and once the field narrows to the last four participants, they will then consolidate into a single ring and fight until there is a winner, who then receives a championship match at a later date.

===Royal Rumble===

WWE&#x27;s Royal Rumble is the original battle royale to use this format. It begins with two wrestlers in the ring, with the remaining participants introduced one by one at a set time period, usually 90 seconds or two minutes.

(referred to as the &quot;Shawn Michaels rule&quot; in Royal Rumble 1995 in which he was thrown over the top rope, hung on to the top rope and only had one foot land on the floor). There is both a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Royal Rumble match, although WWE&#x27;s first official women&#x27;s Royal Rumble match debuted in 2018 used the same rules as the men&#x27;s version, with the winners getting a world championship match (in their respective divisions) at that year&#x27;s WrestleMania, which is WWE&#x27;s biggest annual show. At the Greatest Royal Rumble in 2018, 50 participants entered the match. Stone Cold Steve Austin is the only 3-time Royal Rumble winner.

=== Royal Sambo ===
Dragon Gate&#x27;s version takes place exclusively at touring shows at the Kobe Sambo Hall venue, as the promotion&#x27;s home location is Kobe, Japan. Royal Sambo matches typically consist of 10-16 participants entering two at a time at 60 second intervals, with both wrestlers&#x27; entrance themes crossfading back and forth over the speakers. If an odd number of wrestlers are booked in the match, the final participant enters solo. Participants can be eliminated via over-the-top rope elimination, pinfall, or submission, and multiple wrestlers may pin or submit someone simultaneously. Typically booked as a comedy match, or with one high-profile wrestler as the obvious winner among others with much lower status on the roster.

=== Square Go! ===
Square Go! is Insane Championship Wrestling&#x27;s (ICW) very own hybrid of WWE&#x27;s Royal Rumble and Money in the Bank matches, and named for the Glaswegian term for a street fight.

It has mostly the same rules apply as Royal Rumble, two competitors who draw the numbers 1 and 2. The remaining participants which will enter the ring one-by-one at every two-minute intervals.

Five people have drawn entry numbers that allow them to carry a weapon of their choice into the ring. Participants were eliminated when thrown over the top ropes with both feet landing on the floor. The winner will win a briefcase that will entitle him to a match for the ICW World Championship at any time and anywhere of their choosing for one year (similar to Money in the Bank).

== Series-based variations ==

Series matches may involve the same match throughout, or may use different matches for some or all of the series.
The most common form of a series match is extending the one-fall concept to a series of falls.

=== Best of Series match ===

A &quot;Best of Series&quot; match is similar to a two out of three falls match but an extended series to five or seven; Even though it takes place over several nights to continue a feud rather than settle it in one night.

One variation is a Best of Five Series where a wrestler must win three matches to win the series. John Cena defeated Booker T 3–2 to win the WWE United States Championship at No Mercy (2004).

The Best of Seven Series is another variation, where a wrestler must win four matches to win the series. Chris Benoit and Booker T fought in such a series to determine the #1 contender for the WCW World Television Championship in 1998. The two resumed their Best of Seven series in 2006 for the WWE United States Championship. Sheamus and Cesaro ended in a 3–3 draw when their seventh match at Clash of Champions (2016) ended in a no-contest. Death Triangle (Pac, Penta El Zero Miedo, and Rey Fénix) wrestled The Elite (Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson)) in a series for the AEW World Trios Championship in 2022.

=== Gauntlet match ===
A Gauntlet match, also referred to as a Turmoil match, is a quick series of one-fall one-on-one matches. Two wrestlers begin the match and are replaced whenever one is eliminated (by pinfall or submission). After a predetermined number of wrestlers have competed in the match, the last person standing is named the winner. A Gauntlet match may also be played out in multiple &quot;parts&quot; as part of a storyline (in which a face wrestler must face a series of a heel wrestler&#x27;s underlings before facing the heel himself, for instance) this was common in World Championship Wrestling in the early 1990s. A participant involved in a Gauntlet match may be said to be &quot;running the gauntlet&quot; but in most cases this designation being reserved for those who are involved for most of the match. Sometimes, it could also be (one-on-three) or (one-on-four) handicap match. Unlike tag matches, the three/four-man team will challenge the person handicapped individually until he is knocked out, at which time the match is over.

One example of this was on September 23, 1999 edition of &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot; where Triple H, being punished by Vince McMahon for his actions against him and his family, was booked in five gimmick matches in one night: a Chokeslam Challenge match (a match where the first to Chokeslam their opponent wins) against The Big Show, a Handicap Casket match against Viscera and Mideon, an Inferno match against Kane, a Boiler Room Brawl against Mankind, and a Brahma Bullrope match against The Rock.

====Gauntlet Eliminator====
The Gauntlet Eliminator is a modified gauntlet match in which two wrestlers start in the ring and every four minutes, another wrestler enters until all the entire field has entered. Eliminations can occur only by pinfall or submission. The last wrestler remaining wins.

==== Casino Gauntlet ====
The Casino Gauntlet match is a modified version of the Gauntlet Eliminator promoted by All Elite Wrestling (AEW).

The prize for winning the Casino Gauntlet is a championship match at a later date.

==== Gauntlet for the Gold ====

TNA Wrestling uses the &quot;Gauntlet for the Gold&quot; format, which is named similarly to the Gauntlet match but is actually very different. The wrestlers enter at regular intervals, and elimination occurs when thrown over the top rope with both feet hitting the floor (as in a Royal Rumble match). This continues until only two wrestlers remain, after which the final winner is decided by pinfall or submission. This match type was first featured on the first ever NWA-TNA PPV, with Ken Shamrock defeating Malice in the final two.

=== Iron Man/Woman match ===

An Iron Man (or Iron Woman for female matches) match is a multiple-fall match with a set time limit (usually 30 or 60 minutes). The match is won by the wrestler who wins the most falls within the time limit by either pinfall, submission, disqualification, or countout. If there is ever a tie, the match goes to sudden death overtime in which the wrestler who scores one fall on their opponent will immediately be declared the winner. An example of an Iron Man Match is Dolph Ziggler vs. Seth Rollins at 2018 Extreme Rules for the Intercontinental Championship. Other examples are MJF vs. Bryan Danielson at AEW Revolution in 2023 for the AEW World Championship, and Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XII for the WWE Championship.

Individual members will have a 5 minute Singles Iron Woman match (20 minutes total each), followed by a 40 minute Tag Team Iron Woman match. The team with the highest total number of points within the time limit wins.

==== Ultimate Submission match ====
An Ultimate Submission match is a variation of an Iron Man match where the only way to score a fall within the allotted time limit is to make your opponent submit. Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle had an Ultimate Submission match at Backlash 2001 for 30 minutes plus one minute and 33 seconds of tie-breaking overtime.

=== Three Strikes match ===
The Three Strikes match (often shortened to Three Strikes&#x27; You&#x27;re Out) is a multiple-fall match where wrestlers must achieve three victories of a specific nature in a specific order before the other. The name of the match is taken from baseball, referring to the notion that having three strikes would entail losing the match. The most common arrangement for the three strikes are pinfall, submission and knockout with the entire match being fought under no disqualification and no countout rules. Diamante faced Big Swole in a Three Strikes match on AEW Dark on September 7, 2021.

=== Two out of Three falls match ===
A Two out of Three falls match is a multiple-fall match where a wrestler or tag team must beat the other opponent(s) not once but twice for the victory.

Another match of this type took place at 2002 Armageddon between Shawn Michaels and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. The most recent example of this was at NXT TakeOver 36, when Adam Cole faced Kyle O&#x27;Reilly.

====Three Degrees of Pain match====
The Three Degrees of Pain match is a hybrid match, a variation of Two out of Three Falls and Steel Cage match types where a wrestler must achieve a victory in the specific order before the other. The first victory is a pinfall, the second victory is a submission and if necessary, the third victory is to escape from the steel cage. There have only been two of these matches occurred in TNA history and both were feud-enders.

== Stipulation-based variations ==
As professional wrestling seeks to also tell a story, some matches are made solely for the purposes of advancing the plot. This typically involves the loser of a match being penalized in some way.

===Clock Strikes Midnight match===
The Clock Strikes Midnight match is a singles match where a match is contested under different stipulations, and stipulations of the match keep changing after random intervals. This match was contested between Alexxis Falcon and Nina Samuels at the 2023 Super Strong Style 16. The stipulations changed from time to time from a singles match to different stipulations such as Tables match, First Blood match, Submission match, Last Man Standing match, and Deathmatch.

===Crybaby match===
A Crybaby match is a singles match with the exception that the loser would have to dress as a baby by wearing a nappy and sucking from a bottle. This match only occurred once between 1-2-3 Kid and Razor Ramon at the In Your House 6 pay-per-view.

===Jailhouse match===
A Jailhouse match is a singles match with the exception that the loser would have to spend the night in a New York City jail cell. This match featured heavy brawling by both competitors The Mountie and Big Bossman at SummerSlam 1991. At one point the Mountie tried to use his cattle prod, but missed. Bossman got the pin following a double leg slam and NYC police officers came down to handcuff the Mountie and take him to jail.

A variant of this match, entitled &quot;Jailhouse Street Fight&quot; is a hardcore match where the winner throws an opponent into a cage. This concept was introduced at NXT Roadblock 2023 where Tony D&#x27;Angelo defeated Dijak.

=== Kiss My Foot match ===
A Kiss My Foot match is a singles match with the exception that the loser must kiss the winner&#x27;s bare foot. Such matches included Bret Hart vs. Jerry Lawler during the 1995 King of the Ring, Jerry Lawler vs. Michael Cole during the 2011 Over the Limit pay-per-view. A version of this match was used as a No Holds Barred kiss my foot match at Major League Wrestling&#x27;s 2023 Fury Road event between Matt Cardona and Mance Warner.

====Kiss My Ass match====
A Kiss My Ass match is a singles match in which the loser has to kiss the winner&#x27;s bare buttocks, in front of the crowd; it became prominent during WWE&#x27;s Attitude Era. A notable example is The Rock vs. Billy Gunn at SummerSlam 1999, which The Rock won. The match type made a reappearance for Sheamus vs. Dolph Ziggler at Extreme Rules 2015, where it was branded a Kiss Me Arse match in reference to Sheamus&#x27; Irish accent. Ziggler won, but Sheamus attacked him and forced Ziggler&#x27;s unconscious self to kiss Sheamus&#x27; behind.

=== Last Chance match ===
A last chance match, also called a do or die match, is a championship match where, if the challenger does not win the title, they are banned from challenging for it again as long as the winner of the same match holds it. Rarely, the loser may even be barred from challenging for that title for as long as he remains employed at the company. For example, at Slammiversary XI&#x27;s main event, Sting was defeated by defending champion Bully Ray in a No Holds Barred variant of this match; as per the pre-match stipulation, he was barred from challenging for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship ever again no matter who holds it. A similar situation occurred at All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s 2019 Full Gear event, in which Cody Rhodes lost to AEW World Champion Chris Jericho and could never challenge for the title again as long as he was employed by AEW. Tyson Kidd lost a last chance match against Adrian Neville for the NXT Championship in 2014. As a result, Tyson Kidd would never get another chance at the NXT Championship as long as he remained employed with WWE.

These matches are usually a way to finish a feud between the champion and a certain challenger. It can also be used as a way of keeping the same challenger a title feud with a multiple champions; someone who had previously lost a last chance match may issue a challenge to a new champion as soon as the previous champion - who won a last chance match 
- loses their title. An example of this would be Drew McIntyre, who lost a last chance match for Bobby Lashley&#x27;s WWE Championship but immediately challenged new champion Big E when the latter won the belt from Lashley. A ban may also be lifted in some other way, such as when Sting was able to challenge Magnus for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a No Disqualification Title vs. Career match at Genesis (2014), though Sting lost.

AEW introduced a variation on the Last Chance match called a Championship Eliminator. In this variation, if the challenger defeats the champion, they get a future match for the title, but if they lose, then they can no longer challenge that champion for as long as the champion holds the title.

=== Loser Leaves Town match ===
&quot;Loser leaves town&quot; is a generic term for any match in which the loser has to leave the current promotion or sub-division. These matches were most often held during the &quot;territorial days&quot;, when wrestlers frequently jumped from company to company. It has been held with greater frequency in WWE during the brand split; the losing wrestler typically leaves the brand (usually either Raw or SmackDown), only to go to the other brand. It is also used as a way to write a wrestler off TV to give them some time off.

===Loser Wears A Chicken Suit match===
Loser Wears a Chicken Suit match is a singles match where the loser must wear a chicken suit either following the match or at another event soon after. Col. Robert Parker had to wear a chicken suit on the January 29, 1994 episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; following his loss to Flyin&#x27; Brian Pillman at Clash of the Champions XXVI.

===Loser Wears Dress match===
Loser Wears Dress match is a singles match where the loser must wear a woman&#x27;s dress temporarily after the match occurred. The match is won by pinfall or submission. An example of this type of match is at Souled Out (1999) between Chris Jericho and Perry Saturn which Jericho won.

===&quot;Luchas de apuestas&quot;===

&quot;Luchas de apuestas&quot; (in English meaning &quot;gambling fights&quot;) are matches in which both wrestlers wager something specific (the mask or hair) on the outcome. The loser of the match then loses the item, being forced to take off their mask or be shaved bald. It is also possible for a wrestler to put someone else&#x27;s item on the line, with the same stipulation applying in the event of a loss. These matches have a storied history in Mexico. Upon unmasking, it is not unheard of for a wrestler&#x27;s real name and information to be published. As a form of further humiliation, the loser can be forced to physically hand the mask they just lost to the winner.

The most popular types of wager are the mask of a masked wrestler or the hair of a non-masked wrestler, most commonly put against each other in mask vs. mask (in Spanish: &quot;máscara contra máscara&quot;), mask vs. hair (&quot;máscara contra cabellera&quot;), or hair vs. hair (&quot;cabellera contra cabellera&quot;) matches. Throughout Mexico, when masked wrestlers lose their masks, they are not allowed to compete under a mask with that same gimmick. In addition to masks and hair, championships, or careers — as a form of retirement match — can be put up as the wager in any combination.

====Bounty match====
Similarly the mask can be used in a bounty match, which can be a single match or series of matches where a third party will reward whoever can unmask the targeted competitor. The match can also be used to defeat a targeted individual or take them out of action with a reward. Sometimes the reward is disclosed and sometimes not. An example of the mask bounty match was Flyin&#x27; Brian Pillman having a bounty by Barry Windham after making appearances as The Yellow Dog in order to continue wrestling after losing a loser leaves match.

=== Move match ===
The Move match has the objective of performing a specific move first. Usually a signature move or finisher of the wrestlers is selected, although on occasion it will be a generic move that is notoriously hard to perform on both wrestlers. The match usually takes the name of the target move if both wrestlers are trying to perform their finisher for the win. The best known of these was Yokozuna&#x27;s Bodyslam Challenge, which Lex Luger won. Another famous move match was the $15,000 Body Slam Challenge between Andre The Giant and Big John Studd at the first WrestleMania. Another move match was the Masterlock Challenge which was created by Chris Masters. A Chokeslam Challenge match was also done between The Big Show and Triple H on WWE Smackdown in September 1999. A Stink Face Challenge match is another move match where whoever delivers the Stink Face to their opponent first wins.

====Banned Move match====
The Banned Move match is a singles match when one or both of the competitors is not allowed to use their finishing move or else they will be disqualified. One of the competitors cannot be disqualified if that wrestler uses the move to give an unfair disadvantage. Sometimes this stipulation is used in a feud with wrestlers whose finishers are the same or similar, in these cases it is common to see the stipulation added that the losing wrestler is no longer allowed to use that move anymore. This type of match often forces the banned wrestler to get more creative and use moves they don&#x27;t normally use in an attempt to win. An example of this match took place at Extreme Rules in 2015 between Seth Rollins and Randy Orton, where, in addition to the match taking place in a Steel Cage, Orton&#x27;s finisher, the RKO, was banned. Another example was at the 2020 edition of AEW&#x27;s All Out event, where AEW Champion Jon Moxley defended his title successfully against MJF. In that match, Moxley&#x27;s finisher, the Paradigm Shift (a variation of a DDT) was banned, although he did use it when the referee had his back turned.

=== Retirement match ===
The retirement stipulation can be applied to just one wrestler or both wrestlers in a match can be wrestling for their careers. (Though in practice some wrestlers career may resume their career later either inside or outside the promotion the match occurs in despite being &quot;retired&quot; per the stipulation of the match.) Some examples of this stipulation of match are Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair at WrestleMania XXIV and Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVI. More loosely, the term can refer to the last match of a (usually &quot;legendary&quot;) wrestler&#x27;s career. Such a match is designed to be a last hurrah, showcasing the wrestler&#x27;s talent one last time for their fans. An example of this type includes Sting&#x27;s retirement match at Revolution 2024 and Ric Flair&#x27;s Last Match in 2022.

=== Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal ===
The Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal concept was introduced in WCW at the 1992 Halloween Havoc to determine the stipulation for the match pitting Sting versus Jake Roberts. While not a match type in and of itself, Spin the Wheel, Make the deal involves a wheel of fortune featuring a number of match types. When the wheel is spun, the stipulation it lands on is the one used for the match. The concept was later used in TNA as the &quot;Wheel of Dixie&quot; and in WWE as &quot;Raw Roulette&quot;. Since 2020, WWE has revived Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal for Halloween Havoc, which was itself revived as an event for the NXT brand.

== Strip matches ==
In two kinds of matches, a wrestler does not win by pinfall or submission, but only by stripping their opponent of their clothing. Historically, these types of matches were contested between managers or valets, due to their supposed lack of wrestling ability. In the Attitude Era, however, full-time female wrestlers (known formerly as Divas in WWE) began engaging in strip matches for the purpose of .

=== Bra and Panties match ===
A bra and panties match is usually contested by two or more female wrestlers where the only objective to win this match is to strip her opponent down to her bra and panties.

=== Evening Gown match ===
An evening gown match is usually contested by two female competitors in evening gowns. The only objective to win this match is the wrestler must remove the evening gown from her opponent.

=== Tuxedo match ===
A tuxedo match is usually contested by two male competitors in tuxedos. The only objective to win this match is the wrestler must remove his opponent&#x27;s tuxedo.

== Submission match ==
A submission match is typically a variation of a singles match in which pinfalls, count-outs, and disqualifications are not legal and the match could only end by making an opponent tap out to a submission hold.

===Throw in the Towel match===
A Throw in the Towel match, also known as a No Surrender Rules match in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, is a singles match where there are one or more cornermen for each participant, and victory is obtained when an opponent&#x27;s cornerman throws a towel into the ring to signal surrender on behalf of their wrestler. An example of this type of match is between Bob Backlund with Owen Hart as his cornermen and Bret Hart with The British Bulldog as his cornermen at the 1994 Survivor Series.

===Catch-as-Catch Can match===
A Catch-as-Catch Can match is a singles match where any submission hold are allowed that is not intended to inflict injury, which contained mostly submission amateur-style wrestling. This match is altered to stipulate that a wrestler may lose by going to or being forced to the arena floor, like in a battle royale. An example of this type of match is the infamous match between Dean Malenko and Billy Kidman during WCW&#x27;s Souled Out (2000), where Malenko lost in two minutes by forgetting the rules and escaping to the floor after a barrage of attacks from Kidman.

===&quot;I quit&quot; match===

An &quot;I quit&quot; match is a singles match where a wrestler must force the other wrestler to submit in the form of saying the words &quot;I quit&quot; into a microphone to win. This match is run under hardcore rules - no disqualifications, no countouts and the submission can happen anywhere. The referee follows the action with a microphone in hand during the event.

====&quot;I respect you&quot; match====
An &quot;I respect you&quot; match is a singles match also similar to an &quot;I quit&quot; match, that means: anything goes. In order to win, a wrestler must hurt his opponent brutally that it leaves the other wrestler no other choice but force to say, &quot;I respect you&quot; into the microphone. This match type took place at WCW&#x27;s SuperBrawl VI in 1996 which marked Brian Pillman&#x27;s final match in WCW in his &quot;I respect you&quot; Strap Match against The Taskmaster, before Pillman shouted &quot;I respect you, booker man!&quot;, breaking kayfabe, before leaving the ring.

===Submission Count Anywhere match===
The Submission Count Anywhere match is a variation of a Submission and Falls Count Anywhere match, and was debuted at Breaking Point 2009 between D-Generation X and The Legacy. This is a tag-team stipulation where a wrestler can be submitted anywhere to win, and there are no pinfalls, no disqualifications and no countouts. This match occurred only once in WWE history.

== Substance match ==
The match is contested in a large container filled with various substances, typically between two female individuals who may or may not have experience with wrestling. Substances can include anything from mud to chocolate milk. Sometimes, specialty substances are used for certain occasions like gravy for Thanksgiving and eggnog for Christmas.

A notable example of this match type was the Mimosa Mayhem match, which was contested between Chris Jericho and Orange Cassidy at All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s All Out pay-per-view in September 2020, where the only ways to gain victory were by pinfall, submission or by knocking the opponent into a large vat of mimosa. Unlike the traditional reasoning, the theme fit with both parties&#x27; gimmicks: Jericho was promoting his own line of champagne, and Cassidy is billed as &quot;Freshly Squeezed&quot; as part of his gimmick (in the independent circuit Cassidy would often spit orange juice into his opponent&#x27;s eyes).

Another example of this match was the Chocolate Pudding match when Candice Michelle defeated Melina in one of these matches.

=== Blood Bath match ===
A Blood Bath match is a no-disqualification match where the first to be covered in a vat of blood dispensed from a bucket loses. The Brood members Edge and Gangrel had a Blood Bath match on WWE Raw in August 1999.

=== Mud match ===

Perhaps the most notable substance match was a mud match, where wrestlers would wrestle in an area or container full of mud, usually away from the ring. Usually women would participate in these matches with some occasional male involvement.

====Hog Pen match====
A variation of a Mud Match is the Hog Pen match, which is a Mud Match held in a pig pen on a farm, often filled with mud and pig excrement. Triple H and Henry O. Godwinn participated in a Hog Pen match at WWE&#x27;s In Your House 5 in December 1995. The only objective to win is to be the first wrestler to throw his opponent into a pig pen.

== Team matches ==

Matches are often contested between two or more teams, most often consisting of two members each. Tag team matches can range from two teams of two fighting, to multiple man teams challenging each other.

=== Tag Team match ===
On most occasions, one member of the team competes in the ring with one or more of his or her teammates standing behind the ropes. Wrestlers switch positions by &quot;tagging&quot; one another, usually similar to a high five and, as a result, these teams are referred to as tag teams. This can create tension during the match as an injured wrestler in the middle of the ring attempts to reach his or her teammates, often with the heel team preventing them from doing so. In typical tag team matches, standard wrestling rules apply with a match ending by pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification. Tag team matches have also been seen in mixed martial arts and boxing.

Promotions usually have a tag team championship for a team of two wrestlers, and on rare occasion allies of the reigning tag team will be allowed to defend the title in the place of one of the reigning wrestlers under the Freebird rule. Though common in Mexican &quot;lucha libre&quot;, at one point, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) had a championship for teams of three. WWE also can have three (triple threat) or four (fatal four-way) tag teams going against each other as well. The Tag Team Triple Threat match (known as Tag Team Triangle match in WCW) involves three teams where a member of two teams are in the ring and can tag their partner or a member of the third team. The first team with an active competitor to win by pinfall or submission wins the match for the team.

The Tag Team Four Corners match (also known as Tag Team Fatal Four-Way match) is another variation that starts off with four teams positioned as in a tag team match and two wrestlers active in the ring. The two wrestlers in the ring can tag their partner or members of a team not already represented in the match. It is an advantage to have a team member tagged into the match as you can only win by being a legal competitor in the match and the one who scores the fall wins the match for the team. One example was a four team match for the WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship at Starrcade (2019).

Another variation of the four-way tag team match is to have a member of each of the four teams in competition while their partners are on the apron and the active member who scores a pinfall or submission wins the match for the team. One example of this variation was contested for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship at Clash of Champions (2017).

Sometimes a team will have members of three, four or five in non-elimination tag matches. They are often named based on the number of participants and gender involved. Six-Man (Six-Woman) Tag Team match (known as Trios match in AEW) is one variation. The Wyatt Family defeated The Shield at Elimination Chamber (2014) in a six-man tag team match.

==== Tornado Tag Team match ====
The tornado tag team match (Originally known as the Texas Tornado) is a hardcore-rules match where all wrestlers involved are allowed to be in and wrestle in the ring and elsewhere at the same time, and thus all wrestlers are vulnerable to having a fall scored against them. Whether or not it is truly a tag team match is debatable, as it involves no tagging, but it is contested between tag teams. The first match of this kind was held on October 2, 1937, in Houston between Milo Steinborn and Whiskers Savage against Tiger Daula and Fazul Mohammed. It was the brainchild of promoter Morris Sigel. Another well-known example of this match is when The Shield (Roman Reigns &amp; Seth Rollins) challenged Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan &amp; Kane) for the WWE Tag Team Championship at Extreme Rules (2013).

Another example of this match is All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s renamed Anarchy in the Arena match. The match has been held three times at the annual Double or Nothing pay-per-view event:
* 2022: The Jericho Appreciation Society (Chris Jericho, Daniel Garcia, Jake Hager, Angelo Parker, and Matt Menard) defeated The Blackpool Combat Club (Bryan Danielson and Jon Moxley), Eddie Kingston, Santana and Ortiz by technical submission
* 2023: Blackpool Combat Club (Bryan Danielson, Jon Moxley, Claudio Castagnoli, and Wheeler Yuta) defeated The Elite (Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, Nick Jackson, and &quot;Hangman&quot; Adam Page) by pinfall
* 2024: The Elite (Matthew Jackson, Nicholas Jackson, Kazuchika Okada &amp; Jack Perry) defeated Darby Allin, FTR (Dax Harwood &amp; Cash Wheeler) &amp; Bryan Danielson by pinfall

=== Elimination Tag Team match ===
Tag team matches are occasionally held under elimination rules; that is, the losing wrestler is eliminated from the match, but their team is allowed to continue with their remaining members until all members of one team are eliminated. WWE and other promotions also has three or four tag teams going against each other as well. Anyone can be tagged in by anyone else and can be subject to immediate disqualification for failure to accept a tag. When a wrestler is pinned or force to submit, the entire team is eliminated and the last team remaining wins.

In WWE, these matches are primarily featured during its Survivor Series pay-per-views, where they are billed as a &quot;Survivor Series match&quot;. Teams of four or five, though on some occasions as many as seven, compete under elimination rules. All other standard rules apply, and team members may tag in and out in any order. While some teams are already established stables, others may need to recruit members for their team. In &quot;lucha libre&quot; promotions, a &quot;torneo cibernetico&quot; is a similar type of match between teams of up to eight wrestlers who enter in a predetermined order.

==== Captain&#x27;s Fall match ====
A captain&#x27;s fall match is a tag team elimination match where the two teams of four competitors to compete and captains are assigned to both teams. The purpose of the match is to score a fall over the captain to get the win. Eliminations may occur until the captain is pinned or force to submit, the team loses if the captain is eliminated. This match type only occurred at WWE 205 Live on August 20, 2019 between Team Drew Gulak vs. Team Lorcan.

==== Tag Team Turmoil ====
A tag team turmoil is another version of an elimination tag team match. The match has a team in each of the four corners to start the match, but as each team is eliminated another team takes its place, similar to a gauntlet match. There are five pay-per-view matches of the tag team turmoil took place at SummerSlam in 1999, Armageddon in 2003, Night of Champions in 2010, Night of Champions Kickoff Show in 2013 and Elimination Chamber in 2017. Two teams start, when one is eliminated a new team comes to the ring until all teams have competed, the remaining team is the winner. This was used on the May 31, 2011 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, with a team consisting of a WWE pro and an NXT rookie. The winning team earned three redemption points for the rookie in this version. This was also used on the May 8, 2017 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where the winning team earned a number one contender&#x27;s spot for Matt and Jeff Hardy&#x27;s WWE Raw Tag Team Championship.

====Ultimate Endurance match====

Primarily associated with Ring of Honor (ROH), An Ultimate Endurance match is a tag team elimination match that typically includes three to four tag teams with the members of two. The match starts off with a particular set of special stipulations, with the stipulation changing every time a team is eliminated. These stipulations are predetermined and are not limited to any specific type.

=== Mixed Tag Team match ===
A mixed tag team match features mixed-gender teams that only wrestlers of the same gender may be in the ring at the same time will wrestle each other under the standard rules. For example, if a female wrestler tags her male partner, both women leave the ring and both men enter the ring, the roles is also reversed as well. The Mixed Match Challenge tournament was debuted on January 16, 2018, which both team winners The Miz and Asuka won season one while R-Truth and Carmella won season two, earning themselves the #30 spots in the 2019 Royal Rumble matches and an all-expenses-paid vacation, respectively.

====Intergender Tag Team match====

A intergender tag team match features mixed-gender teams but it differs from the &quot;Mixed Tag Team match&quot; in which that both men and women can be in the ring at the same time to wrestle each other under the tornado tag team rules. This concept was used and popularized in the early 2000s by Team Xtreme during the Attitude Era.

===Stadium Stampede / Anarchy in the Arena match===

A Stadium Stampede match is a type of hybrid tag team, location and cinematic match that originated in All Elite Wrestling. It has been run twice at their Double or Nothing pay-per-view event under this name and three times under the Anarchy in the Arena name, as well as once at their AEW All In London pay-per-view event for a total of six times (when conducted indoors, it is called an Anarchy in the Arena match.) This match typically involves 10 wrestlers in a 5 vs 5 match, and all five wrestlers of the two teams are each part of an established faction in AEW. This often violent and brutal match is contested under hardcore rules, and it starts in a ring in the middle of the stadium or arena and progresses through various environments, such as bars, cargo loading areas and offices. The 2020 edition of this match stayed within the empty TIAA Bank Field and featured the teams brawling around the stadium, while the 2021 edition of this match had the combatants exit the empty stadium and then finally end up in the audience-present central event space at the adjacent Daily&#x27;s Place outdoor amphitheatre, where the match was finished in the Daily&#x27;s Place ring. The first indoor edition took place under the name Anarchy in the Arena at Double or Nothing 2022. The third match under the Stadium Stampede name was held at All In inside London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium in 2023. However, unlike the previous stadium editions, the entire match took place live in front of a crowd, instead of it being a cinematic match.

===Strange Bedfellows match===
A Strange Bedfellows match is a standard 
tag team match where a member of one tag team has to team up with a member of another tag team they are feuding with. One example of this was when Matt Hardy had to team up with Christian against his brother/tag team partner Jeff Hardy and Christian&#x27;s tag team partner Edge.

== Weapon-based variations ==
Through the use of foreign objects, the matches generally take the name of the weapon being used (&quot;Singapore cane match&quot;, &quot;Chairs match&quot;). In the following list of weapon-based matches additional rules have supplanted or replaced the standard rules.

=== Arcade Anarchy match ===
An Arcade Anarchy match is a tag-team hardcore match that originated in AEW where various items found in arcades like air hockey tables, mallet hammers (for Mogura Taiji (Whac-a-Mole)), various video game stalls, a claw crane and even Teddy bears filled with Lego bricks are made available and placed around the ring. There is also a &quot;prize wall&quot; made available with traditional hardcore professional wrestling weapons hanging on this wall. This match was first done on AEW Dynamite on March 31, 2021.

=== Beach Brawl ===
A Beach Brawl is a hardcore match where objects that are found at a beach, like surfboards, wooden benches, wooden tables, beach balls, sports balls and a kiddle pool filled with plastic balls are made available. The match is no-disqualification, so other weapons are also legal. The first Beach Brawl was between Sol Ruca and Blair Davenport in WWE NXT&#x27;s Spring Breakin&#x27; in April 2024.

=== Bricks match ===
A Bricks match is a hardcore match where concrete bricks are made available as weapons. Bricks were often integrated into no-rope barbed wire deathmatches, and bricks first made their appearance in Japanese deathmatches in 1993.

=== Chairs match ===
A Chairs match is a standard weapons match with any number of steel chairs being the only legal weapon to be used. This match can be won by pinfall or submission. The first Chairs match was introduced at between Batista vs. The Undertaker, which Undertaker won by pinfall.

=== Country Whipping match ===
A Country Whipping match is a hardcore match where all competitors are armed with leather belts, which is the only legal weapon in the match. This was known to be The Godwinns speciality match.

=== Crazy 8 match ===
The Crazy 8 match, used mostly in the defunct Pro Wrestling Unplugged promotion, involves placing a championship belt at the top of a scaffold with the first wrestler to retrieve it being declared the winner. Placed in and around the ring for the wrestlers to use during the match are one side of a steel cage, two trampolines, and four rope swings.

=== Fans Bring the Weapons match ===

A Fans Bring the Weapons match is a type of dangerous hardcore match where the competing wrestlers take random blunt objects from audience members and use them in the match. This match was first pioneered in Extreme Championship Wrestling in the mid-1990s.

=== Good Housekeeping match ===
A Good Housekeeping match is a hardcore match where various items usually found in private homes such as trashcans, kitchen sinks, ironing boards, pans, tables, brooms, utensils and various raw food ingredients are made available as weapons and these are the only legal weapons. This match is fought under no-disqualification and no-countout rules. Jeff Jarrett fought Chyna in a Good Housekeeping match at WWF&#x27;s No Mercy 1999.

===Handcuff match===
A Handcuff match is a hardcore match when the only way to win is a wrestler must retrieve a pair of handcuffs then handcuff the opposing wrestler to a ring fixture but sometimes so that the opposing wrestler is unable to make use of their hands.

===Hangman&#x27;s Horror match===
The Hangman&#x27;s Horror match was created by Raven to end his feud with Vampiro w/James Mitchell at TNA&#x27;s IMPACT Wrestling on October 29, 2003. The objective in this match is to wrap your opponent&#x27;s neck with a steel chain and then proceed in hanging him over the ring ropes. Once he is declared unconscious by the referee, the person in charge of the horrific hanging will gain the victory.

=== Kendo Stick match ===

A kendo stick match (also known as a Singapore cane match or Dueling canes match) is a standard weapons match with a kendo stick being the only legal weapon. Often, the ring will be lined with many kendo sticks for the wrestlers to use. Hardcore wrestling promotion Combat Zone Wrestling has used this match with fluorescent light tubes instead of kendo sticks.

=== Ladder match ===

A ladder match is a no-disqualification style match in which a specific object (usually a title belt, a contract or a briefcase) is placed above the ring—out of the reach of the competitors—with the winner being the first person to climb a ladder and retrieve it. This is often used in WWE with their Money in the Bank matches. The ladder may be used as a weapon.

==== Casino Ladder match ====
The Casino Ladder match was created by All Elite Wrestling as a variation of its Casino Battle Royale. A poker chip is hung above the ring beneath a ladder, which can be used as a weapon. The match starts with two wrestlers, with a new participant entering every 2 minutes. The first wrestler to grab the poker chip wins the match, and with it a future AEW World Championship match at a time and place of the wrestler&#x27;s choosing. Notably, the match can be won before all of the intended participants have entered.

==== Full Metal Mayhem match ====
A Full Metal Mayhem match is a variation on a TLC match (see below), where in addition to tables and chairs being present, steel chains are made available, and any other weapon that is metallic (trashcans, thumbtacks) often make appearances. This match originated in TNA Impact Wrestling and this promotion has had at least one of these matches every year since 2005.

==== King of the Mountain match ====

The King of the Mountain match is described as a &quot;reverse ladder match&quot;. Instead of retrieving an object hanging above the ring, the winner is the first person to use a ladder to &quot;hang&quot; a championship belt above the ring—after having scored a pinfall or submission (pinfalls count anywhere) to earn the right to try. A wrestler who has been pinned or forced to submit must spend two minutes in a penalty box. At Slammiversary (2022), the first-ever Queen of the Mountain match took place, with Jordynne Grace defeating champion Tasha Steelz, along with Chelsea Green, Deonna Purrazzo and Mia Yim to win the Impact Knockouts Championship. Four-time Knockouts World Champion Mickie James was the match&#x27;s enforcer.

==== Stairway to Hell match ====
Used in ECW, a Stairway to Hell match is a ladder match with a weapon hanging over the ring. Rather than winning the match by retrieving it, the first wrestler to climb a ladder and retrieve the weapon is allowed to use it in the match. The match is won by standard pinfall or submission.

==== TLC match ====

A tables, ladders and chairs match, often abbreviated as TLC match, is an extension of a ladder match with chairs and tables also being present as legal weapons. This match was introduced because each of the three teams specialized in one of these weapons: Edge and Christian were known for their frequent use of steel folding chairs and the tandem &quot;con-chair-to&quot; move; the Dudley Boyz were known for their pioneering, hard-hitting use of slamming their opponents through wooden event tables; and the Hardy Boyz were known for their high-flying acrobatics off of twin-step ladders. There had been a similar type of match at WrestleMania 2000 called the Triangle Ladder match which also involved tables and chairs. But the first ever official TLC match took place between Edge and Christian, The Dudley Boyz and The Hardy Boyz at the WWF event SummerSlam 2000; and another at Wrestlemania X-Seven.

Due to the destructive, dangerous, violent, frenetic and physically demanding nature of these matches, every subsequent TLC match after the third one held a month after X-Seven was toned down to reduce the physical demands and risks this type of match poses. From 2009 to 2020, WWE has held a pay-per-view in December named TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs, which features this stipulation in its main event. The match has two variations: one is competed as a ladder match, which the person/people must retrieve an object suspended above the ring, and the other is a traditional style match won by pinfall or submission. In WWE, Edge has competed in the most TLC matches (7) including the first three, and has often used this match to gain an advantage in a storyline, with some referring to it as his specialty match.

This match has also been run under singles match rules where a wrestler can win via pinfall, count-out or submission, and tables, ladders and chairs are heavily featured as weapons. Two examples were the “WeeLC” match in 2014 and the Tables, Ladders and Scares (a renamed TLC match) between Tony D’Angelo and Oba Femi in 2024.

====Ultimate X match====

The Ultimate X match is a &quot;ladder match without the ladders&quot; where two cables are strung metal structures rising from the four corners of the ring, crossing above the middle of the ring, forming an &quot;X&quot; pattern. The objective to win this match is to climb the turnbuckles and then climb hand-over-hand across the cables to claim the prize of the match, usually a championship belt. A signature match of Impact Wrestling&#x27;s X Division, the match is contested by three or more wrestlers.

===Nigerian Drum Fight===
A Nigerian Drum Fight is a no-disqualification stipulation weapons match where various musical percussion instruments used in traditional Nigerian music, such as bongos and a gong are made available at ringside, as are tables and kendo sticks. Big E faced Apollo Crews at WrestleMania 37 in a Nigerian Drum Fight.

=== Object on a Pole match ===
The Object on a Pole match, whose name is usually derived from the object being hung, i.e. &quot;Brass knuckles on a Pole&quot;, &quot;Steel chair on a Pole&quot;, &quot;Singapore cane on a Pole&quot;, &quot;Paddle on a Pole&quot;, &quot;Viagra on a Pole&quot;, &quot;Contract on a pole&quot;, &quot;Mistletoe on a Pole&quot; or &quot;Judy Bagwell on a Forklift&quot;, is the spiritual forebear of the ladder match. In this case, an object is placed on a pole that extends from one of the four turnbuckles on the ring with the wrestlers battling to reach it first. Unlike the ladder match, however, reaching the object doesn&#x27;t usually end the match; it simply allows that wrestler to use it as a weapon. This is &quot;not&quot; a no-disqualification match; the weapon on the pole is merely an exception to the disqualification rule. However, this is sometimes a no-disqualification match in which any weapon, plus the one on the pole, can be used. This match is referred to by many wrestling critics as a &quot;Russo Special&quot;, due to the propensity of WCW booker Vince Russo&#x27;s use of Pole Matches during his tenure at the company. Another World Championship Wrestling specialty is the San Francisco 49ers match, where four boxes are placed in the four corners of the ring, one with the championship belt and the other three with weapons. You must find box with the belt to win the match and the championship. To date, this match is only known to have happened in a major wrestling federation once, with Booker T. defeating Jeff Jarrett to become the WCW World Heavyweight champion on October 2, 2000.

Multiple variations of the &quot;Pole match&quot; exist. In some cases the match &quot;is&quot; closer to the ladder match, in that reaching the object does end the match. In others there will be objects above all of the turnbuckles. Further still, there can be a mixture of the two, with an object placed at (though not above) each turnbuckle, one to end the match, the rest to be used as weapons. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling used a &quot;Pole match&quot; as a setup to another match, placing objects at four of their six turnbuckles with the promise that the first wrestler to reach each object would be allowed to use them weeks later at an already scheduled cage match. In a Feast or Fired match each case contains a contract to fight for a TNA World Heavyweight Championship, TNA Tag Team Championship or TNA X-Division Championship, with the final case contains a pink slip, mean the holder of that case would be fired immediately, but if the person holding the X-Division title shot briefcase went on to win that title, it cannot be cashed in right away for the World Heavyweight Championship (Option C). The Coal Miner&#x27;s Glove match is a variation of the typical &quot;Object on a Pole match&quot; in which the object in question is a coal miner&#x27;s glove, which can be used on one&#x27;s opponent upon retrieval.

====Biker Chain match====
A Biker Chain match is a hardcore match where a chain is attached to a pole and is the only legal weapon, but the objective of this match is to pin your opponent. Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker did a Biker Chain match at WWE&#x27;s No Mercy 2003.

=== Pillow Fight ===
A pillow fight is a weapons match with only pillows and a bed are placed in the ring. The pillows may be used as weapons, but other than that, standard wrestling rules apply. Notably, Torrie Wilson once picked up the bed with Candice Michelle on it and threw it. Another variation, the Lingerie Pillow Fight, requires the participants to wear lingerie. Another variation, the Pajama Pillow Fight, requires the participants to wear pajamas.

=== Straitjacket match ===
In a straitjacket match, a wrestler must put their opponent into a straitjacket, usually after knocking the opponent out or by rendering them unconscious by submission holds. It made its televised debut on TNA when Samuel Shaw beat Mr. Anderson by first rendering him unconscious with a chokehold and then putting him into the straitjacket. On WWF Raw in June 1999, Ken Shamrock, who was the only participant confined to the straitjacket, still won his match with Jeff Jarrett after forcing him to submit to a headscissors submission hold.

=== Strap match ===
A strap match, known by many names and done with many slight variations, is any match in which the competitors are placed on the opposite ends of a restraint to keep them in close physical proximity. By definition, the strap and anything tied to it are considered legal and in play weapons. The most common rule for victory is to achieve a pinfall, but there is a common variation where one wrestler must circle the ring and touch all four corners in quick order, without interruption. Because of the strap&#x27;s legality, and subsequent use as a choking device, submissions are generally not allowed.

The traditional strap match involves two wrestlers tied together via a leather strap, with the strap match being one of the most varied forms of professional wrestling match type, both in name and implements used. The name used for the match generally comes from the implement used and one or both of the participants. Common restraints include a belt, bullrope (length of rope with a cowbell the center), steel chains, one to two-foot &quot;leash&quot;, or leather strap, where the wrestlers are tied together at one wrist. This match type is often named Caribbean Strap match when a wrestler from Puerto Rico (such as Savio Vega) is participating on the match or the match is being held on a Puerto Rican promotion like the International Wrestling Association.

====Barbed Wire Chain Deathmatch====
A Barbed Wire Chain Deathmatch is a strap match where instead of two wrestlers being bound together with a leather strap at the wrists, they are bound together with barbed wire at the wrists. This match was done a few times in 1995 in the IWA promotion in Japan with Shoji Nakamaki, Hiroshi Ono and Cactus Jack.

====Dog collar match====
A Dog Collar match is a type of strap match where instead of a leather strap at a wrist, the competing wrestlers are bound together by the neck via dog collars and chains. Made famous by the match between Roddy Piper and Greg Valentine at Starrcade &#x27;83: A Flare for the Gold, AEW has brought the match back in recent times, with Brodie Lee vs. Cody following the stipulation in 2020 (the last match of the former&#x27;s career before his death later that year), and CM Punk vs. MJF at Revolution being highly regarded for their violence. Punk himself competed in another famously violent dog collar match against Raven at ROH Death Before Dishonour 2003.

====Four Corners Strap match====
The Four Corners Strap match is when the first wrestler to touch all four turnbuckle pads in succession without any form of interruption from his opponent or anyone else wins. If at any point a wrestler starts touching pads but is taken down before the wrestler can finish touching them all, they must start over again. There are no pinfalls, no submissions, no countouts, or no disqualifications in this match. At WCW&#x27;s Uncensored 1995, Hulk Hogan actually dragged non-participant (Ric Flair) to all four corners to win his strap match against Big Van Vader. This match was renamed a Samoan Strap match for WWE&#x27;s Extreme Rules 2009 pay-per-view with Umaga facing off against CM Punk. WCW has their own variation strap match as well named the Yapapi Indian Strap match between Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair at the 2000 Uncensored pay-per-view. A No Surrender Dog Collar Strap match is a strap match with the &quot;No Surrender&quot; stipulation added, meaning that neither competitor would be permitted to submit in the match. TNA had a main event at the TNA No Surrender 2005 pay-per-view for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between Raven and Abyss, which Raven won. All Elite Wrestling (AEW) also has its own variation of the Four Corners Strap match, dubbed the South Beach Strap match, which has been used once in a match between Cody Rhodes and Q. T. Marshall at the Road Rager event in July 2021. It was named as such due to the event taking place in Downtown Miami, close to the neighbourhood of South Beach.

====Russian chain match====
A Russian Chain match is a type of strap match where instead of an elastic strap, a thick, 15-foot steel chain is used to bound the wrestlers, and this chain is often used as a weapon. This match has come under many names, including a Texas Chain match. A Biker Chain match is a variation of an Object on a Pole match. The Russian Chain match was the speciality of Ivan Koloff and Boris Malenko.

====Texas Bullrope match====
A Texas Bullrope match is a type of strap match where the wrestlers are bound together by a thick cattle rope with a cowbell attached; the objective of this match is to achieve a single pinfall, or in another variation, victory is achieved by touching all four turnbuckles successively similar to a standard Strap Match (as in the case of JBL vs. Eddie Guerrero in The Great American Bash (2004)). The Rock had his own signature match, the Brahma Bullrope match which was a renamed Texas Bullrope match.

=== Stretcher match ===

A Stretcher match is a hardcore match where a wrestler must incapacitate their opponent to such an extent that they are able to get them onto a stretcher and roll them to the finish line for the victory; usually past a line at the top of the entrance ramp. The stretcher can also be used as a weapon.

=== Steel Stairs match ===
A Steel Stairs match is a hardcore match where the only legal weapon are any number of steel stairs typically situated the on opposite sides of the ring that can be used to enter the ring. The Big Show faced Erick Rowan in a Steel Stairs match at the WWE pay-per view.

=== Symphony of Destruction match ===
A Symphony of Destruction match is a hardcore match where various musical instruments are available at ringside as weapons. This is Elias&#x27;s speciality match and debuted in 2018 when Elias faced Braun Strowman.

=== Tables match ===

A Tables match is a hardcore match in which, to win, one&#x27;s opponent must be driven through a table. It can only be won with an offensive maneuver.

Tables matches can be contested with tag teams, under both elimination and one fall rules. The first tables match was contested at ECW&#x27;s 1995 Double Tables event between The Public Enemy and The Tazmaniac &amp; Sabu for the ECW World Tag Team Championship, whilst the first in the WWE was a tag-team Tables match with The Hardy Boyz versus The Dudley Boyz at the 2000 Royal Rumble. The objective of both of these matches was to drive all opposing team members through tables with offensive moves, but subsequent WWE Tables matches have only required one member to be driven through a table. It is common for tables matches to also include a &quot;no-disqualification&quot; clause, turning them into hardcore matches (although this variation may also be known as a Hardcore Tables match). In some tag matches, a person can save his teammate by breaking the table with his own body. Apparently this does not count against the team.

====Flaming Tables match====
A Flaming Tables match is an Extreme Championship Wrestling specialty match, where the tables are set on fire, and the only way to win is to put opponents through the flaming tables.

====Thanksgiving Leftovers Throwdown====
The Thanksgiving Leftovers Throwdown is a specialty match based on the Thanksgiving holiday. It debuted on the November 26, 2021 Black Friday edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot; between Rick Boogs and Angel Garza. It is a standard wrestling match with a table by ringside covered with leftover foods. No competitor was thrown into the table although Humberto Carrillo, who distracted Boogs, was thrown into the table by Shinsuke Nakamura.

====Two out of Three Tables match====
A Two out of Three Tables match is a hardcore match where it can only be won when a wrestler or tag team puts their opponent or opponent&#x27;s team through two tables, but it does not have to be at the same time. Performing a move on double tables does not count as a victory. It is also a variation of a two out of three falls match.

=== Taped fist match ===
For a taped fist match, the wrestlers are allowed to tape and/or wrap their hands to allow them to punch harder without damaging their hands. The wrestlers must compete with their fists taped, the idea being that this would make it harder to grab each other while at the same time protecting their hands while punching, encouraging the athletes to &quot;fight&quot; instead of wrestle. In one variation, the Taipei Deathmatch, the taped fists are dipped in super glue, then broken glass.

===Viking Rules match===
The Viking Rules match is a viking-themed hardcore match with the ring decorated in a style of a viking ship. This match was introduced by The Viking Raiders on the September 2, 2022 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot; (taped on August 26, 2022) against The New Day.

===Water Fight===
A water fight is a weapons match which the ring is surrounded with buckets of water, water guns and water balloons to use as weapons. Other than that, standard wrestling rules apply. Notably, Jillian Hall once smacked Mickie James over the head with a water gun during this match.

===Weapon Rumble match===
The Weapon Rumble match is a hardcore match invented in DDT Pro-Wrestling in which, similarly to a Rumble rules match, with every time interval a new weapon is introduced in the match. The weapons are chosen by the participants beforehand and can widely vary due to the loose interpretation of the definition of a &quot;weapon&quot; that&#x27;s used by the company in a comedic manner.

===Weapons Wild match===
A Weapons Wild match is a hardcore match where various blunt weapons are made available along the padded barriers at ringside, and are all legal. Wrestlers are armed with at least one weapon when they start the match. This match originated in WWE&#x27;s NXT promotion.

== Winner Takes All match ==

Two scenarios constitute a Winner Takes All match; a title-versus-title match is a match in which both wrestlers (or teams if a tag team match) are champions going into the match, and the winner receives the championship of the loser, thus &quot;taking all&quot;. This differs from a championship unification match, where one championship is absorbed into the other and retired/deactivated. In a Winner Take All scenario, both titles are still active and defended as separate entities. Winner Takes All matches may also take the form of tag team matches, in which two separate titles are fought for in the same match; such as when Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch defended the Universal Championship and Raw Women&#x27;s Championship respectively against Baron Corbin and Lacey Evans at 2019&#x27;s Extreme Rules event.

<text>Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption is a realist novella by Stephen King. It was first published in 1982 by Viking Press in his collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot;. It was later included in the 2009 collection &quot;Stephen King Goes to the Movies&quot;. The plot follows former bank vice president Andy Dufresne, who is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and ends up in Shawshank State Penitentiary, where corruption and violence are rampant.

Stephen King described &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot; as a prison escape story in the vein of old Warner Bros. films. The work, written in a genre unusual for King, is considered one of his best works. The story was adapted to film in 1994 by Frank Darabont. The film, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994, including Best Picture, and has been regarded as one of the best films of all time. The main roles were played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. In 2009, the story was adapted for the stage as &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;.

== Plot ==
The story takes place in Maine and is told from the perspective of Shawshank State Penitentiary prisoner Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding, a 57-year-old Irish-American. In 1938, Red staged a car accident, having previously insured his wife for a large amount, but a neighbor and her child also got into his wife’s car. As a result, Red was sentenced to three life sentences for the murders. Red is known for his ability to smuggle in almost any contraband via his connections.

In 1948, he is approached by former bank vice president Andy Dufresne, a prisoner who arrived at Shawshank a year ago. Dufresne was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. He asks Red to get him a rock hammer, explaining that he is collecting minerals. A year later, Andy requests a large poster of Rita Hayworth. He gets into several fights with a gang of prison rapists led by Bogs Diamond, which end after Bogs is severely injured by the guards; Red suggests that Andy bribed the guards into doing so. One day, Andy overhears guard Byron Hadley complaining about the tax imposed on an inheritance he had recently received and offers help in resolving this issue. Hadley accepts the offer and treats all the prisoners to beer in gratitude. Over the years, Andy provides financial advice to the prison administration and assists with tax returns and loans.

He is transferred to the prison library, in which he launders money for the prison administration. He also seeks funding from the Maine Senate to expand the library, which he hopes will better prepare prisoners for life after release. Andy meets Tommy Williams, who tells him that his cellmate from another prison bragged about committing the murders that Andy was convicted of. Andy attempts to use Tommy&#x27;s testimony to get his case reconsidered, but the warden, Samuel Norton, does not grant his freedom, as Andy knows too much about the administration&#x27;s money laundering scheme and is too valuable as an accountant to release. Hoping to break Andy&#x27;s spirit, Norton places him in solitary confinement for 20 days and transfers Tommy to another prison. While in confinement, Andy refuses to continue accounting but complies when Norton threatens to worsen his living conditions and destroy the library.

In October 1967, Andy tells Red about &quot;Peter Stevens&quot;, a pseudonym under which Andy had sold off his assets and invested the proceeds. He says that one day Peter Stevens will own a seaside resort hotel in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. On the morning of March 12, 1975, after 28 years in prison, Andy disappears from his locked cell. Norton discovers that the poster pasted to Andy&#x27;s cell wall covers a man-sized hole – Andy had used his rock hammer to slowly dig a tunnel through the wall. Norton resigns three months after Andy&#x27;s escape, and six months later, Red receives a blank postcard from McNary, Texas, a town near the Mexican border, and surmises that Andy crossed the border there.

In March 1977, Red is paroled but has difficulty adjusting to life outside of prison. He finds a letter addressed to him from Peter Stevens containing $1,000 and inviting him to join Andy in Mexico. Red decides to break his parole and join Andy.

==Adaptation==
The novella has been adapted into a film, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, starring Tim Robbins as Andy, and Morgan Freeman as Red, and a play of the same name. The film version was nominated for seven Oscars at the 67th Academy Awards in 1995, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Freeman. Morgan Freeman stated in an interview that this novella is his favorite book.

<text>The Body is a novella by American writer Stephen King. &quot;The Body&quot; was published in King&#x27;s 1982 collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot; and later adapted into the 1986 film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.

The story takes place during the summer of 1960 in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine. After a boy disappears and is presumed dead, twelve-year-old Gordie LaChance and his three friends set out to find his body along the railway tracks. During the course of their journey, the boys, who all come from abusive or dysfunctional families, come to grips with death and the harsh truths of growing up in a small factory town that does not seem to offer them much of a future.

==Plot summary==
Gordon &quot;Gordie&quot; Lachance reminisces about his childhood in Castle Rock, Maine. At that time, Gordie&#x27;s elder brother Dennis (also known as Denny), whom his parents favored, had recently died, leaving Gordie&#x27;s parents too depressed to pay much attention to him. In 1960, Gordie and his three friends − Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio − learn that a gang of hooligans led by John &quot;Ace&quot; Merrill have accidentally discovered the dead body of a missing boy named Ray Brower, who was hit by a train. Because the gang found the body while driving a stolen car, they elected not to report the body to the police. The boys get the idea to find the body &quot;officially&quot; so that they may become famous. In preparation for the expedition, Chris steals a gun from his father, and the boys camp out in a nearby field.

Over the course of the narrative, the adult Gordie recalls his first published story, &quot;Stud City&quot;, about the life of a simple man named Edward &quot;Chico&quot; May whose older brother also died. He has a girlfriend, Jane, whom he does not have particularly strong feelings for. Chico knows that his stepmother Virginia slept with his brother before he died, but he hesitates to tell his father about it. One day, Chico has a fight with his father over Virginia and leaves the house.

Along the way, the boys trespass at the town dump and are chased by Chopper, the dump custodian Milo Pressman&#x27;s dog. Teddy gets into a verbal skirmish with Milo when the latter insults Teddy&#x27;s father (a WW2 veteran who was given a &quot;Section 8&quot; medical discharge for trauma related to the Normandy invasion) by calling him a &quot;loonie&quot;. Gordie and Vern are nearly run over by a train while crossing a trestle. While at a resting point, Gordie tells his friends another story, &quot;The Revenge of Lard-Ass Hogan&quot;, in which the titular Davie &quot;Lard-Ass&quot; Hogan exacts vengeance on the town locals for ridiculing his wide girth by downing a whole bottle of castor oil before engaging in the town&#x27;s annual pie-eating contest and vomiting on the previous year&#x27;s champion, which causes a chain reaction that nauseates the entire audience. The next morning, the boys stumble upon a small pond and partake in a swim, but jump out in horror when they find that the pond is teeming with leeches.

After a thunderstorm, the boys finally find the dead body. The body of Ray Brower was discovered to be mangled by the train while attempting to escape the locomotive&#x27;s path. Ace&#x27;s gang arrives shortly after. During an argument, Chris pulls the gun on the gang and forces them to leave, but Ace promises reprisals. Tired, depressed and fearing retaliation, the boys decide there is nothing more to be done with the body and return home. Subsequently, one of the gang members reports the body as an anonymous tip, and the gang members severely beat all four boys. The four friends eventually drift apart, but Gordie and Chris remain close. Chris decides to prepare for higher education, and with Gordie&#x27;s support, they both graduate from the University of Maine. In the present day, Gordie tells how he learned of Chris&#x27;s death after he was fatally stabbed while trying to stop an argument in a restaurant, about the deaths of Vern and Teddy (in a house fire and car crash, respectively), about his successful writing career, and about his recent visit to Castle Rock, where he found that Ace has become an alcoholic and a worker at the town&#x27;s mill.

== Publication ==
&quot;The Body&quot; was published in King&#x27;s 1982 novellas collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot;. It incorporates two earlier short stories by King: &quot;Stud City&quot; (published in &quot;Ubris&quot; in 1969) and &quot;The Revenge of Lard-Ass Hogan&quot; (published in &quot;The Maine Review&quot; in 1975).

===Accusation of plagiarism===
In Lisa Rogak&#x27;s unauthorized biography &quot;Haunted Heart: The Life and Times of Stephen King&quot;, a friend and college roommate of King&#x27;s, George MacLeod, claimed that King had cribbed the idea for &quot;The Body&quot; from a short story MacLeod had been working on, but these claims are disputed by King. MacLeod’s story was written from an experience he had as a child. His father had told him about a dead dog he had spotted on railroad tracks, prompting MacLeod and his friends to go looking for “the body” one day after school. Since MacLeod’s accusations, King has refused his fans&#x27; requests to read their manuscripts for advice; King has explained that he is concerned that there may be further accusations of plagiarism.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;The Body&quot; was adapted into the 1986 film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. The screenplay, by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

<doc id="63999" wikidata="Q7753662" url="?curid=63999" title="The New Lieutenant's Rap">
<text>&quot;The New Lieutenant&#x27;s Rap&quot; is a short story by Stephen King. It was originally published as a limited run chapbook by Philtrum Press in 1999 and was later reworked into &quot;Why We&#x27;re in Vietnam&quot;, a short story appearing in King&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
The story, set in summer 1999, opens with two American veterans of the Vietnam War, Dieffenbaker and John Sullivan, conversing after the funeral of Dick Pagano, another veteran whom they had served with. Sullivan recalls an incident in Đông Hà when Dieffenbaker, his commanding officer, had ordered him to kill another soldier, Clemson, to prevent him from massacring Vietnamese civilians. After Sullivan asks Dieffenbaker &quot;Why were we in Vietnam to begin with?&quot;, Dieffenbaker - who has grown immensely cynical and bitter following his experiences in Vietnam - opines that their generation &quot;had achieved little of value&quot; and postulates that the two men are still in Vietnam - with their memories of events that have happened since the product of &quot;a pot-bubble&quot; - and that Vietnam is the preferable of the two competing realities. The story ends with Sullivan agreeing, thinking &quot;We stay because it&#x27;s better.&quot;

== Publication ==
&quot;The New Lieutenant&#x27;s Rap&quot; was originally published by Philtrum Press (King&#x27;s own imprint) in chapbook format, with 500 numbered copies being printed. The text of the chapbooks was in King&#x27; handwriting. The chapbooks, which were autographed by King, were gifted to attendees at a party held to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the publishing of King&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Carrie&quot; that was held at Tavern on the Green in New York City. It has never been sold commercially. A &quot;substantially revised&quot; version of &quot;The New Lieutenant&#x27;s Rap&quot;, retitled &quot;Why We&#x27;re in Vietnam&quot;, was published in King&#x27;s book &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; later that year. 

== Reception ==
Rocky Wood states, &quot;It is as great a pleasure to read a story in King&#x27;s handwriting as it is to listen to his audio recordings.&quot;

<text>Apt Pupil is a 1998 American thriller film directed by Bryan Singer and starring Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro. It is based on the 1982 novella &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; by Stephen King. In the 1980s in southern California, high school student Todd Bowden (Renfro) discovers fugitive Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander (McKellen) living in his neighborhood under the pseudonym Arthur Denker. Bowden, obsessed with Nazism and acts of the Holocaust, persuades Dussander to share his stories, and their relationship stirs malice in each of them.

The novella was first published in King&#x27;s 1982 collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot;. Producer Richard Kobritz sought to adapt the novella into a film during the 1980s, but two actors he invited to play Dussander died. When filming began in 1987, a loss of financing led to the production being shut down. Forty minutes of usable footage existed, but production was never revived. In 1995, when rights to the novella returned to King, Bryan Singer petitioned the author for an opportunity to adapt the novella. With King&#x27;s support, Singer filmed &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; with McKellen and Renfro in Altadena, California, in 1997. The director shortened the novella&#x27;s storyline, reduced its violence, and changed the ending. Singer called &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; &quot;a study in cruelty&quot; with Nazism only serving as a vehicle for the capacity of evil.

During the $14 million production, a lawsuit was filed by several extras, including some underage who alleged that they were told to strip naked during a shower scene. There was no cause to file criminal charges, and a civil-case lawsuit was dismissed due to insufficient evidence. The film was released in the United States and Canada in October 1998 to mixed reviews and made under $9 million. The main actors won several minor awards for their performances.

==Plot==
In Southern California in 1984, 16-year-old high school student Todd Bowden discovers that his elderly neighbor, Arthur Denker, is Kurt Dussander—a former Nazi concentration camp commandant who is now a fugitive war criminal. Todd, fascinated with Nazi atrocities perpetrated during World War II, blackmails Dussander, forcing him to share disturbing stories of what it was like working at Nazi extermination camps and how it felt to participate in genocide.

Todd purchases an SS uniform from a costume shop and forces Dussander to wear it. As he spends more time with Dussander, his schoolwork suffers, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. Dussander begins blackmailing Todd in return, forcing him to work to restore his grades by threatening to expose the subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd&#x27;s grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd&#x27;s school counselor Edward French. Talking about the war crimes affects both the old man and the young boy. An intoxicated Dussander tries and fails to kill a cat with his gas oven. Dussander also takes pride in Todd&#x27;s remarkable turnaround, going from near-dropout to straight As in a matter of weeks.

One night, Dussander tries to kill a homeless person who earlier had seen him in the uniform. When Dussander has a heart attack, he calls Todd, who finishes the killing, cleans up, and calls an ambulance for Dussander. At the hospital, Dussander is recognized by a death camp survivor sharing his room. He is arrested and an extradition to Israel is arranged. Todd graduates as valedictorian and gives a speech about Icarus, saying, &quot;All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction. It is the desire to do better, to dig deeper, that propels civilization to greatness.&quot; The scene is juxtaposed in a montage with Dussander&#x27;s home being searched and the corpse being found in the basement.

Todd is questioned about his relationship with Dussander and he convinces the police that he knew nothing of the man&#x27;s true identity. A group of Neo-Nazis demonstrates outside the hospital; realizing his situation is hopeless, Dussander commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd&#x27;s grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails French into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances.

==Cast==
Ian McKellen stars as Kurt Dussander, a Nazi war criminal who hides in America under the pseudonym Arthur Denker. Screenwriter Brandon Boyce described Dussander as being &quot;a composite of these ghosts of World War II&quot; but not based on any real-life individual. McKellen was attracted to the role because he was impressed with Singer&#x27;s &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and saw the role of Dussander as &quot;a nice, meaty part and difficult&quot;. Singer, who enjoyed McKellen in John Schlesinger&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, invited the actor to take the role. The character&#x27;s language was written originally for &quot;a very stoic German&quot;, but Singer felt that McKellen&#x27;s &quot;complex&quot; personality could contribute to the character. The director said of choosing McKellen, &quot;I felt if I could combine his complexity, his colorfulness, to the stoic German character it would create a character that, although evil, would garner more sympathy and would be more enjoyable for the audience to watch.&quot;

Brad Renfro stars alongside McKellen as Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old who discovers Denker&#x27;s criminal past. Singer auditioned a couple hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, &quot;Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real. Not only could he have the intensity when we wanted, there was a hollowness that he could convey, and by the end of the picture he had to become this empty vessel.&quot; Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind. Renfro said of his performance, &quot;It&#x27;s a trip I have to take. People just kind of have to leave me alone when I&#x27;m doing it. It&#x27;s my job.&quot; He described Todd as a &quot;very articulate boy&quot; who unveils himself as a &quot;monster&quot;, which also signified a departure from his previous roles as the &quot;rebel&quot; or the &quot;oversensitive bad boy&quot;. Singer described his impression of the character:

Schwimmer plays Edward French, Todd Bowden&#x27;s high school guidance counselor. Before Schwimmer, Kevin Pollak was attached to the role. While Schwimmer was known for his comedic role on the television show &quot;Friends&quot;, Singer was impressed by the actor&#x27;s performance in a Los Angeles stage production and decided to cast him as the counselor.

==Production==
Under the studio Sony Pictures Entertainment, &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; was directed by Bryan Singer based on a screenplay by Brandon Boyce that adapted the 1982 novella &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; by Stephen King. The production was &quot;a Sony Pictures Entertainment release from TriStar Pictures of a Phoenix Pictures presentation of a Bad Hat Harry production&quot;.

===Previous production attempt===
When Stephen King&#x27;s novella &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; was published as part of his collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot; in 1982, producer Richard Kobritz optioned feature film rights to the novella. Kobritz met with actor James Mason to play the novella&#x27;s war criminal Kurt Dussander, but Mason died in July 1984 before production as a result of a heart attack. The producer also approached Richard Burton for the role, but Burton also died in August that same year. By 1987 production on the film began with Nicol Williamson cast as Kurt Dussander, and 17-year-old Rick Schroder was cast as Todd Bowden. In that year, Alan Bridges began direction of the film with a script co-written by Ken Wheat and his brother Jim Wheat. After ten weeks of filming, the production suffered from a lack of funds from its production company Granat Releasing, and the film had to be placed on hold. Kobritz sought to revive production, but when the opportunity came a year later, Schroder had aged too considerably for the film to work. Forty minutes of usable footage was abandoned.

===Direction under Bryan Singer===

Bryan Singer first read &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; when he was 19 years old, and when he became a director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script adapting the novella. Boyce recalled the writing process, &quot;I thought it was a great stageplay, actually ... two people, pretty much in a house talking. My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn&#x27;t work out, at least I&#x27;d have a writing sample.&quot; When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer&#x27;s film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King&#x27;s ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, &quot;Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece.&quot; The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal, &quot;There have been a lot of fun horror movies like &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot;, and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. But I miss movies like &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, and &quot;The Innocents&quot; by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie sort of in the spirit of the real horror movie.&quot;

Singer described &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;″s premise as a &quot;study in cruelty&quot;. He prepared for the film by reading books like the 1996 history book &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot;, which confirmed his beliefs that Nazi war criminals felt &quot;guiltless and matter-of-fact about what they did&quot;. He referred to how young Todd Bowden&#x27;s interactions with Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander start to affect him, &quot;I liked the idea of the infectious nature of evil ... The notion that anybody has the capacity within them to be cruel if motivated properly is, I think, a scary concept.&quot; The director also perceived the film as not about the Holocaust, believing that the Nazi war criminal could have been replaced by one of Pol Pot&#x27;s executioners or a mass murderer from Russia. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t about fascism or National Socialism. It was about cruelty and the ability to do awful deeds, to live with them and be empowered by them,&quot; Singer said. To this end, the director sought to avoid overt use of swastikas and other Nazi symbols. He was also attracted to the film as &quot;[an] idea that the collective awfulness of this terrible thing that happened decades ago in Europe had somehow crept up across the ocean and through time, like a golem, into this beautiful Southern California suburban neighborhood&quot;.

Singer turned down directing opportunities with films like &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; after the success of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. He instead pursued &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, &quot;It was a very dark subject matter, and it was something that came from passion.&quot; He acknowledged in retrospect that &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; &quot;wasn&#x27;t really supposed to be a big success&quot;. Singer was financially supported by producer Scott Rudin and the production company Spelling Films. Ian McKellen was cast as Dussander, and Brad Renfro was cast as Bowden. With $1 million paid toward pre-production, filming was scheduled to begin in June 1996. Due to financial disagreements between Singer and Rudin, the start date was pushed back and subsequently canceled. Singer and his production team stayed together while producer Don Murphy and his partner Jane Hamsher sought refinancing. Mike Medavoy, a former chairman of TriStar Pictures, rescued the production with the financial backing of his production company Phoenix Pictures. The company provided filmmakers with $14 million to produce &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;. Filming took place on location in Altadena, California. Singer related to how Todd Bowden rebelled against his suburban environment. The director used the name of his high school football team, the Pirates, and the green-and-gold team colors in the film, saying, &quot;I just projected my own childhood right out to Southern California.&quot;

===Editing and composition===
John Ottman served as both film editor and music composer for &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;. When he edited the film, he found it a challenge to create the proper musical score. Ottman recalled, &quot;Normally, an editor will score scenes with temporary music from CDs, and so forth, and nothing I could find worked for this film.&quot; The composer sought a mix between the scores of the science fiction film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) and the military-based comedy &quot;1941&quot; (1979) to create an &quot;otherworldly pastiche&quot;. Ottman said of his approach:

When you throw a cat in the oven, it&#x27;s easy to have someone in the orchestra slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring the hell out of everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there&#x27;s a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene ... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.

Another scene in which Ottman meshed his editing and composing duties was when Dussander wakes up in the hospital with the television show &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; playing in the background. Ottman explained his intent for the scene, &quot;I used &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; as this innocuous thing—going between him and the television—so that when he does open his eyes, it scares the hell out of you ... I added this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound.&quot; Ottman recorded the film&#x27;s score with the Seattle Symphony.

==Critical analysis==
===Obsession with Nazism and the Holocaust===
In &quot;The Films of Stephen King&quot;, Dennis Mahoney writes that the obsession with Nazism and the Holocaust that unfolds in &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; is the result of the paternal bond between Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander and high school student Todd Bowden. Such bonds are common themes in Stephen King&#x27;s works: &quot;King&#x27;s portrayal of evil most often appears to require an active, illicit bond between a male (often in the role of a father or father surrogate) and a younger, formerly innocent individual (often in the role of a biological or surrogate progeny) who is initiated into sin&quot;. In the film, the year 1984 highlights, in addition to Orwellian overtones, the time in American history in which the Holocaust is treated as a week-long course with little time &quot;to be tempered with self-questioning as to the motivations behind it&quot;. Bowden&#x27;s obsession with the Holocaust is a key plot device &quot;wherein the past has this unbreakable hold on the present&quot;. The film&#x27;s opening sequence shows how Bowden treats this history as a simulacrum in which the history becomes his own, as evidenced by his head&#x27;s brief overlapping with the Nazis he is studying. Though history becomes alive for Bowden, he perceives it through the perpetrators (namely Dussander) and not through the victims, characterizing Bowden as &quot;apt&quot; in the sense of &quot;a natural tendency to ... undesirable behavior&quot;.

Mahoney says language serves as &quot;a vehicle for corruption&quot;, as Dussander tells Bowden horrific stories of his service at the fictional Death Camp of Patin. Bowden, in listening to the stories, becomes &quot;a vampiric extension of the evil&quot; that Dussander exhibits. The sharing of stories lead both Dussander and Bowden to have nightmares, and for Bowden, the nightmares are &quot;a past that is becoming ever more present&quot;. One of the key motifs of the film is that &quot;a door was opened that could not be shut&quot;, referring to Dussander&#x27;s confession about following orders and being unable to hold back. The motif is also conveyed in the scene in which Bowden forces Dussander to put on a Schutzstaffel uniform and to march to Bowden&#x27;s commands. Dussander continues marching despite Bowden&#x27;s insistences to stop, emulating the premise of Goethe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; in which the untrained apprentice uses magic to enchant brooms and lacks the skill to stop them. The scene is &quot;the figurative and literal turning point in the film&quot;.

===Sadomasochism, homoeroticism, and homophobia===
Mahoney says that sadomasochism, homoeroticism, and homophobia are highlighted in Bryan Singer&#x27;s retelling of Stephen King&#x27;s novella. In &quot;Frames of Evil: The Holocaust as Horror in American Film&quot;, Caroline Picart and David Frank write that the face of evil is represented in the film as Nazism, oft labeled as &quot;quintessentially innate [and] supernaturally crafty&quot;, but also &quot;in a more subterranean way, dangerously blurring ... the boundaries between homoeroticism and homosexuality&quot;. The Nazi monstrosity in &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; is structured through sexual &quot;abnormality&quot;, where a series of binary dichotomies are introduced: &quot;normal versus monstrous, heterosexual versus homosexual, and healthy versus sick&quot;. An additional dichotomy, victimizer (masculinized) versus victim (feminized), reflects the film&#x27;s &quot;hidden tensions&quot; in which Bowden and Dussander&#x27;s roles of powers are reversible. While the &quot;set of perversions&quot; that unfold in the novella are misogynistic, the film unfolds the set as &quot;ambivalently homoerotic and homophobic&quot;. The film removes the novella&#x27;s misogyny and leaves intact the underlying homoeroticism of the central characters. The film also expounds the connection between homophobia and how male Holocaust victims are portrayed.

The central characters Todd Bowden and Kurt Dussander are onscreen most of the time, and they are frequently framed in close proximity, which Picart and Frank describe as &quot;[intensifying] a homoerotic intimacy [which is] punctuated by dread of contact with the monstrous&quot;. Homoeroticism in &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; is further demonstrated by the focus on Todd&#x27;s body. In the opening scene in which Bowden is in his bedroom during a stormy night, &quot;the ever-encroaching camera and the lighting fetishize Todd&#x27;s youthful body&quot;, similar to the fetishism of the female body in films like &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). This depiction creates a dualism in which &quot;he is now simultaneously dangerous and endangered&quot; in his homophobic and homoerotic ties to Nazism.

When Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to wear and in which to march under Bowden&#x27;s orders, the student&#x27;s demands are more heightened in the film as &quot;more dominant and voyeuristic&quot;, according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, &quot;I tried to do this the nice way, but you don&#x27;t want it. So fine, we&#x27;ll do this the hard way. You will put this on, because I want to see you in it. Now move!&quot; The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden&#x27;s reaction are from a low angle, which reflects &quot;the sexual difference between the characters&quot;; Bowden is masculinized as &quot;the bearer of the [sexual] gaze&quot;, and Dussander is feminized as &quot;the object of the gaze&quot;. The cutting between Bowden and Dussander &quot;corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images&quot; which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot reverse shot &quot;radically [ruptures] the structure of power&quot;, where Bowden loses &quot;control of his sadistic power over Dussander&quot;.

==Differences between novella and film==
Stephen King&#x27;s novella &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; begins in 1974, when Todd Bowden is in junior high, and it ends with him graduating from high school. In Bryan Singer&#x27;s film, the story takes place fully in 1984, when Todd Bowden is in his last year in high school. In the novella, for three years leading to the end of the story, Todd Bowden and discovered Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander independently murder a large number of hobos and transients, whereas in the film, the murders are condensed to Dussander&#x27;s attempt to kill the hobo Archie. Singer sought to reduce the novella&#x27;s violence, not wanting it to appear &quot;exploitative or repetitive&quot;. Unlike in the novella, animosity toward Jews was not explicitly displayed by the characters in the film. The novella&#x27;s dream sequence in which Bowden rapes a sixteen-year-old Jewish virgin as a laboratory experiment under Dussander&#x27;s guidance was replaced by the film&#x27;s dream sequence in which Bowden sees three shower-gas chamber scenes unfold. Reduced in the film was Todd&#x27;s encounter with the schoolgirl Betty (named Becky in the film). In the novella, he dreams of Betty as a concentration camp inmate whom he can rape and torture. In the film, he has a brief encounter with Becky where he finds himself unable to perform sexually.

In the novella, Bowden&#x27;s high school counselor Edward French confronts the student with suspicions that Dussander is not really Bowden&#x27;s grandfather, and Bowden murders French in cold blood. Bowden then embarks on a shooting spree from a tree overlooking a freeway, which results in his death five hours later. Singer felt unable to accomplish King&#x27;s ending, &quot;I told [King] the ending reads so beautifully. I could never measure up to it; I would have killed it.&quot; In the film, Bowden intimidates French, who suspects Dussander&#x27;s false relationship to the student, by threatening to destroy him with &quot;rumor and innuendo&quot;. Stanley Wiater, author of &quot;The Complete Stephen King Universe&quot;, wrote, &quot;As depicted on screen, Todd is much more consciously evil, in his way, than in the book. This switch, while making the ending less brutal, perhaps, achieves the impossible: it also makes the ending even darker.&quot;

==Release and reception==
Bryan Singer previewed &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; at the Museum of Tolerance&#x27;s L.A. Holocaust Center to assess feedback from rabbis and others about referencing the Holocaust. With a positive response, the director proceeded with the film&#x27;s release. &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in February 1998, but the film&#x27;s distributor moved the release date to autumn, feeling that it belonged &quot;alongside other more serious-minded films&quot;. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 1998. It was then commercially released on October 23, 1998 in 1,448 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing on its opening weekend and placing ninth at the weekend box office. The film went on to gross in the United States and Canada. &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; was considered a critical and commercial disappointment. The film was less successful than Singer&#x27;s previous film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, with critics describing it as &quot;a somewhat disturbing movie that works as a suspenseful thriller, yet isn&#x27;t completely satisfying&quot;.

Roger Ebert, reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, wrote that the film was well-made by Bryan Singer and well-acted, especially by Ian McKellen, but that &quot;the film reveals itself as unworthy of its subject matter&quot;. The critic felt that the offensive material lacked a &quot;social message&quot; or an &quot;overarching purpose&quot; and found the film&#x27;s later scenes to be &quot;exploitative&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; applauded the production value of Bryan Singer&#x27;s direction, liking Newton Thomas Sigel&#x27;s &quot;handsomely shot&quot; cinematography and John Ottman&#x27;s &quot;stunningly edited&quot; work. Maslin wrote of McKellen and Renfro&#x27;s performances, &quot;Both actors play their roles so trickily that tensions escalate until the horror grows unimaginatively gothic.&quot; The critic felt that as the film approached the end, &quot;the story&#x27;s cleverness is noticeably on the wane&quot;.

Kathleen Murphy of &quot;Film Comment&quot; called McKellen and Renfro&#x27;s performances &quot;skin-crawling&quot; but felt that it did not complete the film. Murphy wrote, &quot;[The acting] makes you wish &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; had the art and the courage actually to look into evil&#x27;s awful abyss.&quot; The critic perceived that &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; came off as a conventional horror film, that it had Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;characteristically unsavory&quot; touches, and that Singer&#x27;s &quot;inept&quot; direction &quot;trivialize[s] the characters and the subject matter&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; saw &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; as not a &quot;hunted-Nazi thriller&quot; nor a &quot;full-tilt Stephen King thriller&quot;, but as a &quot;student-teacher parable&quot; that comes off as &quot;disturbing&quot;. Schwarzbaum felt that Singer told &quot;a story with serious moral resonance&quot;, though patience was needed to get past Singer&#x27;s &quot;more baroque cinematic touches&quot; of &quot;visual furbelows ... and aural gimmicks&quot; in the film, citing as examples Dussander watching Mr. Magoo on television or the musical piece &quot;Liebestod&quot; being blared during a bloody scene.

Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; &quot;most compelling for its moral dimension&quot;, enjoying the &quot;duet between Renfro&#x27;s smooth-cheeked latter-day Faust and McKellen&#x27;s reawakened Mephistopheles&quot;. While Carr found the film&#x27;s framework to be realistic, he noted the change of pace, &quot;Perhaps sensing a narrative slackening and a smothering claustrophobia ... &#x27;Apt Pupil&#x27; veers into melodramatic devices that yank the film out of its disquieting amorality and turn it into something much more ordinary and mundane.&quot; The critic concluded, &quot;It maintains a bleak integrity by not pretending to arrive at remorse. Never is there any discussion.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; as &quot;a good shocker that misses the ultimate horror&quot;, finding the film&#x27;s weakness to be the &quot;contrived&quot; bond between Dussander and Bowden. Wilmington called the plot &quot;overly slick&quot;, asking, &quot;How can Todd not only conveniently find a Nazi war criminal in his hometown but also instantly coerce and control him?&quot;

==Accolades==
Renfro won the Best Actor award at the Tokyo International Film Festival for his performance in &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;. Ian McKellen won a Critics&#x27; Choice Award for Best Actor and a Florida Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his performance in both &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot;. The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films awarded a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor to McKellen for his performance and awarded the film a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film of 1998.

==Lawsuit==
For &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, Bryan Singer filmed a shower scene in which Todd Bowden, saturated with horrific stories from Kurt Dussander, imagines his fellow showering students as Jewish prisoners in gas chambers. The scene was filmed at Eliot Middle School in Altadena, California on April 2, 1997, and two weeks later, a 14-year-old extra filed a lawsuit alleging that Singer forced him and other extras to strip naked for the scene. Two boys, 16 and 17 years old, later supported the 14-year-old&#x27;s claim. The boys claimed trauma from the experience, seeking charges against the filmmakers including infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and invasion of privacy. Allegations were made that the boys were filmed for sexual gratification. The local news shows and national tabloid programs stirred the controversy. A sexual crimes task force that included local, state, and federal personnel investigated the incident. The Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s office determined that there was no cause to file criminal charges, stating, &quot;The suspects were intent on completing a professional film as quickly and efficiently as possible. There is no indication of lewd or abnormal sexual intent.&quot; The scene was filmed again with adult actors so the film could finish on time.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote in 2020, &quot;Singer was one of several defendants named in the suits, which reportedly were settled for an undisclosed sum, with the plaintiffs bound by confidentiality agreements.&quot;

<text>Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm is a line drawing algorithm that determines the points of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, all of which are very cheap operations in historically common computer architectures. It is an incremental error algorithm, and one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics. An extension to the original algorithm called the &quot;midpoint circle algorithm&quot; may be used for drawing circles.
While algorithms such as Wu&#x27;s algorithm are also frequently used in modern computer graphics because they can support antialiasing, Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm is still important because of its speed and simplicity. The algorithm is used in hardware such as plotters and in the graphics chips of modern graphics cards. It can also be found in many software graphics libraries. Because the algorithm is very simple, it is often implemented in either the firmware or the graphics hardware of modern graphics cards.

The label &quot;Bresenham&quot; is used today for a family of algorithms extending or modifying Bresenham&#x27;s original algorithm.

==History==
Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm is named after Jack Elton Bresenham who developed it in 1962 at IBM. In 2001 Bresenham wrote:
I was working in the computation lab at IBM&#x27;s San Jose development lab. A Calcomp plotter had been attached to an IBM 1401 via the 1407 typewriter console. [The algorithm] was in production use by summer 1962, possibly a month or so earlier. Programs in those days were freely exchanged among corporations so Calcomp (Jim Newland and Calvin Hefte) had copies. When I returned to Stanford in Fall 1962, I put a copy in the Stanford comp center library.

A description of the line drawing routine was accepted for presentation at the 1963 ACM national convention in Denver, Colorado. It was a year in which no proceedings were published, only the agenda of speakers and topics in an issue of Communications of the ACM. A person from the IBM Systems Journal asked me after I made my presentation if they could publish the paper. I happily agreed, and they printed it in 1965.

==Method==

The following conventions will be applied:
* the top-left is (0,0) such that pixel coordinates increase in the right and down directions (e.g. that the pixel at (7,4) is directly above the pixel at (7,5)), and
* the pixel centers have integer coordinates.
The endpoints of the line are the pixels at formula_1 and formula_2, where the first coordinate of the pair is the column and the second is the row.

The algorithm will be initially presented only for the octant in which the segment goes down and to the right (formula_3 and formula_4), and its horizontal projection formula_5 is longer than the vertical projection formula_6 (the line has a positive slope less than 1).
In this octant, for each column &quot;x&quot; between formula_7 and formula_8, there is exactly one row &quot;y&quot; (computed by the algorithm) containing a pixel of the line, while each row between formula_9 and formula_10 may contain multiple rasterized pixels.

Bresenham&#x27;s algorithm chooses the integer &quot;y&quot; corresponding to the pixel center that is closest to the ideal (fractional) &quot;y&quot; for the same &quot;x&quot;; on successive columns &quot;y&quot; can remain the same or increase by 1.
The general equation of the line through the endpoints is given by:
:formula_11.

Since we know the column, &quot;x&quot;, the pixel&#x27;s row, &quot;y&quot;, is given by rounding this quantity to the nearest integer:

:formula_12.

The slope formula_13 depends on the endpoint coordinates only and can be precomputed, and the ideal &quot;y&quot; for successive integer values of &quot;x&quot; can be computed starting from formula_9 and repeatedly adding the slope.

In practice, the algorithm does not keep track of the y coordinate, which increases by &quot;m&quot; = &quot;∆y/∆x&quot; each time the &quot;x&quot; increases by one; it keeps an error bound at each
stage, which represents the negative of the distance from (a) the point where the line exits the pixel to (b) the top edge of the pixel. 
This value is first set to formula_15 (due to using the pixel&#x27;s center coordinates), and is incremented by &quot;m&quot; each time the &quot;x&quot; coordinate is incremented by one. If the error becomes greater than &quot;0.5&quot;, we know that the line has moved upwards
one pixel, and that we must increment our &quot;y&quot; coordinate and readjust the error to represent the distance from the top of the new pixel – which is done by subtracting one from error.

==Derivation==
To derive Bresenham&#x27;s algorithm, two steps must be taken. The first step is transforming the equation of a line from the typical slope-intercept form into something different; and then using this new equation to draw a line based on the idea of accumulation of error.

===Line equation===

The slope-intercept form of a line is written as

:formula_16

where formula_17 is the slope and formula_18 is the y-intercept. Because this is a function of only formula_19, it can&#x27;t represent a vertical line. Therefore, it would be useful to make this equation written as a function of both formula_19 &quot;and&quot; formula_21, to be able to draw lines at any angle. The angle (or slope) of a line can be stated as &quot;rise over run&quot;, or formula_22. Then, using algebraic manipulation,

:formula_23

Letting this last equation be a function of formula_19 and formula_21, it can be written as

:formula_26

where the constants are
* formula_27
* formula_28
* formula_29

The line is then defined for some constants formula_30, formula_31, and formula_32 anywhere formula_33. That is, for any formula_34 not on the line, formula_35. This form involves only integers if formula_19 and formula_21 are integers, since the constants formula_30, formula_31, and formula_32 are defined as integers.

As an example, the line formula_41 then this could be written as formula_42. The point (2,2) is on the line

:formula_43

and the point (2,3) is not on the line

:formula_44

and neither is the point (2,1)

:formula_45

Notice that the points (2,1) and (2,3) are on opposite sides of the line and formula_46 evaluates to positive or negative. A line splits a plane into halves and the half-plane that has a negative formula_46 can be called the negative half-plane, and the other half can be called the positive half-plane. This observation is very important in the remainder of the derivation.

===Algorithm===
The starting point is on the line

:formula_48

only because the line is defined to start and end on integer coordinates (though it is entirely reasonable to want to draw a line with non-integer end points).

Keeping in mind that the slope is at most formula_49, the problem now presents itself as to whether the next point should be at formula_50 or formula_51. Perhaps intuitively, the point should be chosen based upon which is closer to the line at formula_52. If it is closer to the former then include the former point on the line, if the latter then the latter. To answer this, evaluate the line function at the midpoint between these two points:

:formula_53

If the value of this is positive then the ideal line is below the midpoint and closer to the candidate point formula_54; i.e. the y coordinate should increase. Otherwise, the ideal line passes through or above the midpoint, and the y coordinate should stay the same; in which case the point formula_55 is chosen. The value of the line function at this midpoint is the sole determinant of which point should be chosen.

The adjacent image shows the blue point (2,2) chosen to be on the line with two candidate points in green (3,2) and (3,3). The black point (3, 2.5) is the midpoint between the two candidate points.

=== Algorithm for integer arithmetic ===
Alternatively, the difference between points can be used instead of evaluating f(x,y) at midpoints. This alternative method allows for integer-only arithmetic, which is generally faster than using floating-point arithmetic. To derive the other method, define the difference to be as follows: 
:formula_56
For the first decision, this formulation is equivalent to the midpoint method since formula_57 at the starting point. Simplifying this expression yields:
:formula_58

Just as with the midpoint method, if formula_59 is positive, then choose formula_54, otherwise choose formula_55.

If formula_55 is chosen, the change in formula_63 will be: 
:formula_64
If formula_54 is chosen the change in formula_63 will be:
:formula_67

If the new D is positive then formula_68 is chosen, otherwise formula_69. This decision can be generalized by accumulating the error on each subsequent point.

All of the derivation for the algorithm is done. One performance issue is the 1/2 factor in the initial value of D. Since all of this is about the sign of the accumulated difference, then everything can be multiplied by 2 with no consequence.

This results in an algorithm that uses only integer arithmetic.

 plotLine(x0, y0, x1, y1)
 dx = x1 - x0
 dy = y1 - y0
 D = 2*dy - dx
 y = y0
 for x from x0 to x1
 plot(x, y)
 if D &gt; 0
 y = y + 1
 D = D - 2*dx
 end if
 D = D + 2*dy

Running this algorithm for formula_70 from (0,1) to (6,4) yields the following differences with dx=6 and dy=3:

 D=2*3-6=0
 Loop from 0 to 6
 * x=0: plot(0, 1), D≤0: D=0+6=6
 * x=1: plot(1, 1), D&gt;0: D=6-12=-6, y=1+1=2, D=-6+6=0
 * x=2: plot(2, 2), D≤0: D=0+6=6
 * x=3: plot(3, 2), D&gt;0: D=6-12=-6, y=2+1=3, D=-6+6=0
 * x=4: plot(4, 3), D≤0: D=0+6=6
 * x=5: plot(5, 3), D&gt;0: D=6-12=-6, y=3+1=4, D=-6+6=0
 * x=6: plot(6, 4), D≤0: D=0+6=6

The result of this plot is shown to the right. The plotting can be viewed by plotting at the intersection of lines (blue circles) or filling in pixel boxes (yellow squares). Regardless, the plotting is the same.

===All cases===
However, as mentioned above this only works for octant zero, that is lines starting at the origin with a slope between 0 and 1 where x increases by exactly 1 per iteration and y increases by 0 or 1.

The algorithm can be extended to cover slopes between 0 and -1 by checking whether y needs to increase or decrease (i.e. dy &lt; 0)

 plotLineLow(x0, y0, x1, y1)
 dx = x1 - x0
 dy = y1 - y0
 yi = 1
 if dy &lt; 0
 yi = -1
 dy = -dy
 end if
 D = (2 * dy) - dx
 y = y0
 for x from x0 to x1
 plot(x, y)
 if D &gt; 0
 y = y + yi
 D = D + (2 * (dy - dx))
 else
 D = D + 2*dy
 end if

By switching the x and y axis an implementation for positive or negative steep slopes can be written as 

 plotLineHigh(x0, y0, x1, y1)
 dx = x1 - x0
 dy = y1 - y0
 xi = 1
 if dx &lt; 0
 xi = -1
 dx = -dx
 end if
 D = (2 * dx) - dy
 x = x0
 for y from y0 to y1
 plot(x, y)
 if D &gt; 0
 x = x + xi
 D = D + (2 * (dx - dy))
 else
 D = D + 2*dx
 end if

A complete solution would need to detect whether x1 &gt; x0 or y1 &gt; y0 and reverse the input coordinates before drawing, thus
 plotLine(x0, y0, x1, y1)
 if abs(y1 - y0) &lt; abs(x1 - x0)
 if x0 &gt; x1
 plotLineLow(x1, y1, x0, y0)
 else
 plotLineLow(x0, y0, x1, y1)
 end if
 else
 if y0 &gt; y1
 plotLineHigh(x1, y1, x0, y0)
 else
 plotLineHigh(x0, y0, x1, y1)
 end if
 end if

In low level implementations which access the video memory directly, it would be typical for the special cases of vertical and horizontal lines to be handled separately as they can be highly optimized.

Some versions use Bresenham&#x27;s principles of integer incremental error to perform all octant line draws, balancing the positive and negative error between the x and y coordinates.

 plotLine(x0, y0, x1, y1)
 dx = abs(x1 - x0)
 sx = x0 &lt; x1 ? 1 : -1
 dy = -abs(y1 - y0)
 sy = y0 &lt; y1 ? 1 : -1
 error = dx + dy
 while true
 plot(x0, y0)
 e2 = 2 * error
 if e2 &gt;= dy
 if x0 == x1 break
 error = error + dy
 x0 = x0 + sx
 end if
 if e2 &lt;= dx
 if y0 == y1 break
 error = error + dx
 y0 = y0 + sy
 end if
 end while

==Similar algorithms==
The Bresenham algorithm can be interpreted as slightly modified digital differential analyzer (using 0.5 as error threshold instead of 0, which is required for non-overlapping polygon rasterizing).

The principle of using an incremental error in place of division operations has other applications in graphics. It is possible to use this technique to calculate the U,V co-ordinates during raster scan of texture mapped polygons. The voxel heightmap software-rendering engines seen in some PC games also used this principle.

Bresenham also published a Run-Slice computational algorithm: while the above described Run-Length algorithm runs the loop on the major axis, the Run-Slice variation loops the other way. This method has been represented in a number of US patents:

The algorithm has been extended to:
* Draw lines of arbitrary thickness, an algorithm created by Alan Murphy at IBM.
* Draw multiple kinds curves (circles, ellipses, cubic, quadratic, and rational Bézier curves) and antialiased lines and curves; a set of algorithms by Alois Zingl.

<text>GNU Mach is an implementation of the Mach microkernel. It is the default microkernel in the GNU Hurd. GNU Mach runs on IA-32 machines. GNU Mach is maintained by developers on the GNU project. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

==History==
Early versions of the Hurd were developed on top of CMU&#x27;s Mach 3.0.

In 1994, CMU stopped working on Mach, and the GNU Project switched to the University of Utah&#x27;s Mach 4. The kernel known as &quot;GNU Mach&quot; was derived from Mach 4 once Utah stopped development. The first ChangeLog entry by Thomas Bushnell (rather than by a Utah researcher) is from 16 December 1996.

In 2002, Roland McGrath branched the OSKit-Mach branch from GNU Mach 1.2, intending to replace all the device drivers and some of the hardware support with code from OSKit. After the release of GNU Mach 1.3, this branch was intended to become the GNU Mach 2.0 main line; however, as of 2006, OSKit-Mach is not being developed due to lack of activity in OSKit itself. Around 2006, an attempt to replace GNU Hurd&#x27;s kernel with the Coyotos kernel also ended in failure.

GNU Mach 1.4 was released on 27 September 2013, eleven years after 1.3.

<doc id="64010" wikidata="Q471926" url="?curid=64010" title="The Eyes of the Dragon">
<text>The Eyes of the Dragon is a fantasy novel by American writer Stephen King, first published as a limited edition slipcased hardcover by Philtrum Press in 1984, illustrated by Kenneth R. Linkhauser. The novel would later be published for the mass market by Viking in 1987, with illustrations by David Palladini. This trade edition was slightly revised for publication. The 1995 French edition did not reproduce the American illustrations; it included brand new illustrations by Christian Heinrich, and a 2016 new French version also included brand new illustrations, by Nicolas Duffaut.

At the time of publication, it was a deviation from the norm for King, who was best known for his horror fiction. The book is a work of epic fantasy in a quasi-medieval setting, with a clearly established battle between good and evil, and magic playing a lead role. &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; was originally titled &quot;The Napkins&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; takes place entirely within the realm of Delain (which itself is located within In-World from &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series, as established in &quot;The Little Sisters of Eluria&quot;). It is told from the perspective of an unnamed storyteller/narrator, who speaks casually and frankly to the reader, frequently adding his own commentary on characters&#x27; motivations and the like.

King Roland&#x27;s magician, Flagg, seeking to destroy the Kingdom of Delain, sees his plans being ruined by the good heart of Queen Sasha. After Sasha gives birth to Peter, a noble and worthy future king, Flagg realizes that his position, his plans, and his life may be in danger because of Peter. When Sasha is pregnant with a second son, Flagg seizes the opportunity. He forces the Queen&#x27;s midwife to wound Sasha while the second son, Thomas, is born. Sasha bleeds to death and Flagg begins plotting to remove Peter.

As Peter becomes a teenager, he begins the custom of bringing a glass of wine to his father before bed each night. Flagg decides to use this as a means of framing Peter. He dissolves a poison called Dragon Sand in a glass of wine and delivers it to the king after Peter leaves. Previously, in an attempt to win Thomas&#x27; friendship, Flagg had shown him a secret passage where Thomas could spy on his father. Unbeknownst to Flagg, when he delivers the poison, Thomas is watching through the glass eyes of the mounted head of Roland&#x27;s greatest trophy, Niner the dragon. Flagg plants evidence incriminating Peter.

After a brief trial, during which the judge decides Peter is guilty, he is locked up in the enormous tower called the Needle in the center of the city. Thomas is then crowned King, although he is only twelve years old; due to his youth and his fearful inexperience, he allows Flagg enormous amounts of power. At the start of his long stay in the Needle, Peter manages to send a note to the judge who convicted him, Anders Peyna, with the seemingly innocuous requests to have his mother&#x27;s old dollhouse and napkins with his meals. Peyna is puzzled by the requests, but, seeing no harm in them, grants them. Five years later, Peter escapes from the Needle, having used the toy loom in the dollhouse and threads from the napkins to make a rope. After the escape he and his allies rush to get Roland&#x27;s bow and arrow. However, it is not to be found because Thomas had it once they got into the king&#x27;s &quot;sitting room&quot;. Flagg, now revealed as a demonic being, is about to kill them when Thomas reveals himself and tells Flagg that he (Thomas) watched Flagg poison Roland. Thomas shoots Flagg in the eye, but Flagg uses magic to disappear and escape. At the end of the novel, Peter is declared to be the rightful king. Thomas, who has become deeply hated in Delain, sets off alongside his butler, Dennis, to find Flagg. They find him and confront him, but the narrator does not reveal the outcome. 

==Characters==
===House Delain===
* King Roland the Good – Delain&#x27;s ruler as the novel opens. In his younger and more virile days, Roland was renowned for slaying Niner the Dragon with Foe-Hammer, a great hunting-arrow forged by his mother, Queen Lita. Over the years since then, Roland has become somewhat infirm and addled. He trusts Flagg, his counselor, little realizing the ill will that Flagg harbors toward him. However, early in the story, he does favor his wife&#x27;s advice more than Flagg&#x27;s. Roland is the husband of Queen Sasha; their sons are Peter and Thomas.
* Queen Sasha – Roland&#x27;s wife; mother of Peter and Thomas. Sasha was chosen for Roland because she was an innocent girl from a lesser noble family...and, seemingly, the shyest of those whom Flagg had selected for Roland. Flagg believed Sasha would pose the least long-term threat to his authority; Roland, for his part, chose her since she seemed the least frightening to him. Yet Sasha revealed herself to be a strong and independent woman, who truly loved - and was truly loved in return by - both Roland and the kingdom. She was murdered under Flagg&#x27;s orders while giving birth to Thomas. Her cousin is Squire Andrew Staad.
* Prince Peter – Roland&#x27;s elder son, heir to the throne of Delain. Peter is a tall, lithe, handsome young man who has inherited his mother&#x27;s good looks and his father&#x27;s love of the common man. He is openly favored among the people of Delain to be their next King. Peter rides a horse named Peony.
* Prince Thomas – Roland&#x27;s younger son. Thomas takes after Roland, being slow and heavy even in childhood. He feels overshadowed by Peter and resents his elder brother because Roland clearly loves Peter more. Yet Thomas, like their father, is a talented archer; in this he can outstrip even Peter. As Thomas gets older, Flagg becomes his only friend and sole source of comfort. Crowned &quot;Thomas the Light-Bringer,&quot; he soon receives the nickname &quot;Thomas the Tax-Bringer&quot;...due to the merciless 80% tax increase he imposed upon the people of Delain at Flagg&#x27;s urging.
* Queen Lita – granddaughter of Queen Kyla the Good; daughter of King Landry; mother of King Roland the Good; grandmother of Princes Thomas and Peter. She forged the great hunting-arrow known as Foe-Hammer.
* King Alan II (aka Alan the Mad, mentioned only) – uncle of Queen Kyla the Good; grandfather of King Landry. Alan&#x27;s legendarily-beautiful cousin Eleanor married Duke Leven Valera of the South Barony (aka the Black Duke).
* Queen Kyla the Good (mentioned only) – niece of King Alan the Mad; mother of King Landry; grandmother of Queen Lita.
* King Landry (mentioned only) – grandson of King Alan the Mad; son of Queen Kyla the Good; father of Queen Lita; grandfather of King Roland the Good

===House Reechul===
* Charles Reechul – Naomi&#x27;s father.
* Naomi Reechul – the eldest daughter of farmer Charles Reechul. This peasant girl ultimately joins up with the Exiles, a developing resistance group. She and her dog Frisky help Ben Staad (whom she later marries) to locate Dennis.

===House Staad===
* Squire Andrew Staad – cousin of Queen Sasha; husband of Susan; father of Ben and Emmaline.
* Susan Staad – wife of Squire Andrew; their offspring are Ben and Emmaline.
* Ben Staad – Peter&#x27;s cousin and closest friend, although the Staad family is considered Delain&#x27;s most unfortunate. Ben is strong, handsome, and loyal. He eventually marries Naomi Reechul.
* Emmaline Staad – Ben&#x27;s younger sister.

===Other characters===
* Prince Ailon – mythological ruler of the Moon; he drives his lunar chariot across the sky every night.
* Aron Beson – Chief Warder of the Needle.
* Browson – Another alias of Flagg from long ago. 
* Anna Crookbrows – Queen Sasha&#x27;s midwife, and a pawn in her assassination. Her only son was twenty when he contracted Shaking Disease (“the Shakes”, for short). Flagg cured him in exchange for her killing Queen Sasha.
* Dennis – Peter&#x27;s butler. He, his father Brandon, and their family have served the royals of Delain for centuries; Dennis takes great pride in his work. He is complicit in Peter&#x27;s imprisonment; Dennis found the poison, which killed King Roland, inside Peter&#x27;s room. He acted as Thomas&#x27;s butler upon Roland&#x27;s death, and later aided Peter&#x27;s escape. Ultimately, Dennis goes with Thomas on his quest to find Flagg.
* Quentin Ellender – Delain&#x27;s greatest craftsman.
* Flagg from the land of Garlan (aka Flagg the Hooded) – the Royal Adviser to King Roland. Flagg, a powerful wizard, has been around for centuries. He has served as a counselor to at least four successive monarchs: Roland&#x27;s grandparents and parents, Roland himself, and Thomas. Though Flagg has lived in Delain for roughly seventy years, he has only appeared to age ten. Later in the story, it is revealed that Flagg has appeared in Delain multiple times, under multiple guises...the oldest-known of which took place over five hundred years in the past. His ultimate goal is to overthrow Delain&#x27;s monarchy and to plunge the kingdom into &quot;a thousand years of bloody anarchy, give or take a few months&quot;. (In &quot;The Stand&quot;, Randall Flagg was the personification of evil; Flagg plays a part in the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novels as well. Almost definitely the same Flagg as in the Dark Tower, the Stand, and many other works of Stephen King.)
* Galen – Goshawk (a rank indicated to be equal to a Corporal) of Delain&#x27;s Home Guard.
* Bill Hinch – once served as Lord High Executioner, he was one of Flagg&#x27;s personas during a previous stay in Delain (and is now a folk tale to strike fear in naughty children).
* Lord-Chancellor Anders Peyna – The Kingdom&#x27;s Judge-General, who presides over the Royal Court of Delain. The people are far more afraid of Peyna than they are of the King. Peyna condemns Peter to his imprisonment, but is later convinced of the prince&#x27;s innocence. Along with Ben Staad and Dennis, he helps engineer Peter&#x27;s escape from the Needle (albeit unwittingly) by raising the jailhouse bribe which allows Peter to have the dollhouse and napkins. Peyna is served by his butler Arlen.
* Rhiannon – Dark Witch of the Coos.
* Splitfoot – The Devil.
* Lord Towson
* Ulrich Wicks – one of the ten Great Lawyers of Delain.
* Yosef – serves King Roland as head groom.

==Reception==
&quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; was warmly received by professional critics. Barbara Tritel of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; as drawing clear influence from European fairy tales and wrote that the novel was &quot;more elegant than any other novel Mr. King has written so far.&quot; Some of King&#x27;s established fans rejected the novel, considering it a children&#x27;s book – King originally wrote the novel for his children. Another reason for fan rejection of &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; was the fact that it was epic fantasy, with little to no elements of the horror that typified King&#x27;s most successful work of this era. Negative fan reaction to &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; was an inspiration for King&#x27;s subsequent novel &quot;Misery&quot;. The protagonist of &quot;Misery&quot; was a successful romance novelist who killed off his most popular character to allow himself to write in other styles of fiction, only to be imprisoned by an angry, deranged fan; King saw &quot;Misery&quot; as a metaphor for his feelings of being chained to writing horror fiction.

==Relationship with other works==
*Flagg (Randall Flagg), the villain of this story, is directly involved with &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series, appearing as one of Roland of Gilead&#x27;s main antagonists. He is also the main antagonist in &quot;The Stand&quot;.
*In &quot;The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three&quot;, Roland Deschain mentions Thomas and Dennis visiting Gilead. &quot;Great Letters&quot; are also used in both novels.
*The witch Rhiannon (Rhea) of the Coos appears in &quot;The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass&quot;, and uses Flagg&#x27;s technique of becoming &quot;dim&quot;. Garlan, the land Flagg claims to be from, is also mentioned several times.
*H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Necronomicon&quot; makes a cameo as a grimoire that Flagg reads from frequently (but only a bit at a time; to read too long is to risk madness). The book is not named, but King does mention that it was written by the wizard Alhazred.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
Initially &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; was to be created as an animated film produced through the French company WAMC Entertainment. The film would have a budget of $45 million and was expected to release in late 2001 or early 2002. However the film did not progress into active production and the rights lapsed in 2000.

===Television adaptation===
In 2012 Syfy announced that it was developing several projects for potential television adaptations, one of which was &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;. If successfully developed, the book would be made into either a movie or miniseries. Michael Taylor and Jeff Vintar were confirmed to be penning the script and Taylor and Bill Haber would act as executive producers.

In 2019 news broke that Hulu was adapting the book as a television series. In September 2020, Seth Grahame-Smith, a producer and screenwriter for the Hulu adaptation, appeared on The Kingcast podcast with news that Hulu decided to cancel the project due to budgetary concerns and changes to the Hulu&#x27;s executive team.

<doc id="64011" wikidata="Q756675" url="?curid=64011" title="Hearts in Atlantis">
<text>Hearts in Atlantis (1999) is a collection of three novellas and two short stories by Stephen King, all connected to one another by recurring characters and taking place in roughly chronological order. The stories are loosely autobiographical; in an author&#x27;s note, King writes that while the places in the book are fictionalized, &quot;Although it is difficult to believe, the sixties are not fictional; they actually happened.&quot;

==Stories==

===&quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;===
In the first and longest work in the book, the year is 1960. A young boy named Bobby Garfield lives in Harwich, Connecticut, with his mother, Liz, a widow. He befriends a man named Ted Brautigan, who possesses psychic abilities. He confesses to Bobby that he is being stalked by &quot;low men&quot; who wear yellow coats and drive garish cars. Although Bobby agrees to let Ted know when he starts seeing &quot;lost pet&quot; signs that indicate that the low men are near, Bobby says nothing when he eventually starts seeing them for fear of losing his friend.

One day, Bobby finds his friend Carol has been beaten by three bullies with a baseball bat and left in a grove of trees. He takes her to his apartment, where Ted has to remove her shirt in order to set her dislocated shoulder. Liz comes home (herself having just been violently raped at a real estate seminar) and assumes that Ted has been molesting Carol. They resolve the misunderstanding, and Liz takes Carol home. Suspecting that his mother has told the low men of Ted&#x27;s whereabouts, Bobby catches up to Ted just as they are about to take him away. Bobby is given the choice to go with Ted—destination unknown. He decides to stay, but despises himself for his decision.

After leaving Harwich with his mother and twice being put in a juvenile detention facility, Bobby receives an envelope from Ted filled with red rose petals. He knows that Ted is once again free of the low men.

===&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;===
The next part of the book, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, takes place in 1966. Peter Riley, a freshman at the University of Maine, gets addicted to playing hearts in the all-male dormitory where he lives. Although their student draft deferments have shielded them from serving in the Vietnam War, Riley and the growing number of students addicted to the game (led by student Ronnie Malenfant, who introduced the game to the dorm) put themselves at risk as their studies suffer.

Peter eventually meets Carol, Bobby Garfield&#x27;s childhood friend. Carol herself uses student activism as an escapist addiction of her own. Although they fall in love, Carol comes to announce that she will be leaving school. She explains that her decisions are forever influenced by the help that Bobby had given her when they were 11. She and Riley make love for the first time in his car. The next morning, she leaves a note warning him to stop playing hearts.

When Stokely Jones, a disabled student activist (who specifically asks for a third floor dorm room, in spite of being on crutches), slips and falls in a rainstorm, Riley is disturbed by the strange way he and the other boys laughed at Jones&#x27;s misfortune. He finds he is shaken from his hearts addiction and resolves to turn his grades around. Shortly afterward, Jones is accused of having sprayed &quot;Fuck Johnson&quot; on a campus wall, with the dormitory floor proctor reasoning that the peace signs accompanying the message lead to Jones. However, Riley and the others point out that they, too, have been toting peace signs, undermining the accusation and saving Jones from punishment.

Riley barely passes his classes and receives a package from Carol containing a newspaper article of a protest she participated in.

===&quot;Blind Willie&quot;===
This short story was originally published in the October 1994 issue of &quot;Antaeus&quot;, and in 1997 was published as part of King&#x27;s limited edition collection &quot;Six Stories&quot;. For its inclusion in &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, the story was heavily revised.

Willie Shearman is a Vietnam veteran who lives in Connecticut but sits in a particular sidewalk location in downtown New York City each day. He pretends to be blind to receive money from people passing by, becoming blind every afternoon at the time of day that he was caught in a firefight and temporarily blinded. He believes that his blindness and begging is a form of penance for his involvement in the childhood beating of Carol (from &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;) and continuously writes apologies to her in notebooks that he carries around. Willie also keeps a scrapbook about her: her involvement in activist groups became increasingly militant under the guidance of a Svengali-like leader named Raymond Fiegler (a name with the initials R.F., suggesting that he is Randall Flagg). The group became responsible for a bombing at a recruiting office, giving Carol the name &quot;Red Carol&quot; (though she may have tried to stop the bomb). Carol was believed killed when their headquarters was raided and the building accidentally set afire.

At the end of the day, Willie&#x27;s sight returns, signifying it is time to return home to his suburban lifestyle. The story ends just as he gains inspiration for how to deal with the policeman he&#x27;s been bribing to keep from getting arrested.

=== &quot;Why We&#x27;re in Vietnam&quot; ===
Two veterans, John Sullivan (another childhood friend of Bobby Garfield&#x27;s) and a man named Dieffenbaker reunite at the funeral of a third. They revisit an incident that almost escalated into a My Lai-type massacre: stressed by the effort at rescuing survivors of a helicopter crash, Ronnie Malenfant (who first appears as another Hearts player in &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;) vows to burn a village in Dong Ha as a message to the enemy. After Malenfant stabs a woman with his bayonet and things are spiralling out of control, Dieffenbaker has a soldier shoot dead another rampaging soldier to stop the impending massacre. Later, Sullivan is gravely wounded. When he is airlifted out of combat, he sees the old woman who had been stabbed (&quot;mamasan&quot;) sitting in the chopper with him, a hallucination that has continued in perpetuity.

A recurring theme of the conversation between Sullivan and Dieffenbaker is the growing sense between the two men that the various characters of their youths &quot;sold out&quot; in various ways to the allure of materialism and conformity.

During the drive home from the funeral, Sullivan is caught in a traffic jam. Evidently hallucinating, he begins to see things fall from the sky: cordless phones, a grand piano, appliances, and a long yellow coat like the &quot;low men&quot; wear. He is struck by one more object, and picks it up to discover it is Bobby Garfield&#x27;s Alvin Dark glove. Mamasan, glowing brightly, speaks for the first time, saying she will keep him safe. He abruptly finds himself back in his car. All objects which fell from the sky are gone, except the glove, which Sullivan wears on his hand. Sullivan grows very tired, closes his eyes, and dies of an apparent heart attack.

===&quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling&quot;===

Bobby Garfield returns to Harwich to attend John Sullivan&#x27;s funeral. He also visits the park where he once came upon Carol Gerber with her arm injured after being beaten by neighborhood boys. In the park, he encounters Carol, alive but scarred and burned. She says that she now goes by the name Denise Schoonover. Bobby reveals that he had come because Sullivan&#x27;s probate lawyer sent him his old Alvin Dark fielder&#x27;s mitt with his current address in Ted&#x27;s handwriting. He then produces what was in the glove: the copyright page from &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, showing that although it came from the 1960 edition, it is still brand new. On it is written a message for Carol from Ted, &quot;Tell her she was as brave as a lion&quot;, and the equation she had written for Peter Riley on his copy (&quot;♡ + ☮ = INFORMATION&quot;) in &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot;

==Reception==
Charles de Lint praised &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; as &quot;the Great American Baby Boomer Novel&quot;, saying that, &quot;when he&#x27;s at the top of his form, as he certainly is here, he [King] can be as provocative and inspired as &lt;insert your favorite literary author here&gt;.&quot;

==Film adaptation==
&quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling&quot; formed the basis of a 2001 film entitled &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins as Ted Brautigan, Anton Yelchin as Bobby Garfield, Mika Boorem as Carol Gerber and Hope Davis as Liz Garfield. Major story elements are common to the film and the story, but many of the details were changed. In addition, all the references to the Dark Tower were removed and the final destinies of the characters, revealed in the latter stories of the original novel, are excluded. A further consequence of the changes is that the film&#x27;s title is completely impenetrable to those unfamiliar with the novel, although a snatch of dialogue attempts to remedy this: Ted remarks that childhood is a lost city like Atlantis.

==Connection to King&#x27;s other works==
The town of Derry is mentioned several times to be near the University of Maine. Derry is a recurring setting for King&#x27;s novels and short stories, like &quot;It&quot; and &quot;Insomnia&quot;.

&#x27;The Regulators&#x27; are mentioned, and appear in several stories linked with the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; universe.

When Ted has &#x27;gone blank&#x27; he uses language that occurs often in the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; universe, as when he says &quot;There will be water if God wills it&quot; and &quot;All things serve the Beam.&quot;

When Ted sends Bobby a letter toward the end of the novel, the envelope is filled with red rose petals; the Dark Tower stands in a field of red roses called Cań-Ka No Rey.

Insofar as &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series&#x27; overall plot is concerned, it is revealed in the seventh book that Ted is essential to the Crimson King&#x27;s quest to break the beams that hold the Dark Tower up, which in turn holds the universe together.

&quot;Low men&quot; also appear in King&#x27;s novella &quot;Ur&quot;, published for Amazon&#x27;s Kindle in 2009.

One of the bullies who beat Carol, Harry Doolin, shares a surname with minor characters in &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot;, Molly and Eamon Doolin, as well as the villain John Doolin (alias Jim Dooley and ZackMcCool) in &quot;Lisey&#x27;s Story.

Raymond Fiegler, who is identified near the novel&#x27;s end as leader of an activist group when he prevents Carol Gerber from retrieving an unexploded bomb on a college campus, is very likely another alias of Randall Flagg, a recurring villain in many of King&#x27;s works. King never identifies Fiegler as Flagg, but Christopher Golden and Hank Wagner suggest in &quot;The Complete Stephen King Universe&quot; that there is little doubt Fiegler is Flagg. Golden and Wagner cite evidence such as Fiegler&#x27;s ability to make himself appear &quot;dim&quot; (an ability shared by Flagg in &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;), his manipulation of Carol Gerber and her activist friends and Flagg&#x27;s frequent use of aliases (usually with the initials &quot;R.F.&quot;).

<text>&quot;Umney&#x27;s Last Case&quot; is a short story by American author Stephen King, first published in King&#x27;s collection &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; (1993). In July 1995, it was published as a separate paperback as part of Penguin&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

&quot;Umney&#x27;s Last Case&quot; is an example of metalepsis in narratology.

==Background information==
Prior to the story&#x27;s original appearance in the &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; collection, Viking Press made the text available online three weeks prior to the book&#x27;s publication in September 1993 via OBS (The Online Bookstore) for $5.

==Plot summary==
The story begins as a Raymond Chandler pastiche, and follows a private investigator named Clyde Umney as he goes about what he thinks is just another morning in 1930s Los Angeles. He soon discovers that his life as he knows it is falling apart. All of his lifelong friends and associates are abruptly departing in one fashion or other, for reasons ranging from winning the lottery to terminal cancer, and many of them express disdain towards Umney in place of farewells.

Umney is brooding alone in his office when he receives his final client: Landry, the crime-fiction author who created him. Having suffered the loss of his wife and child as well as a severe case of shingles, Landry took an overdose of medication and found himself in the world of his creation. He demonstrates that his will is law in this world, and explains to a helpless Umney that he intends to take Umney&#x27;s place to live a life of eternal adventure and excitement. Umney is cast into oblivion—or so it seems.

Umney finds himself in the year 1994, occupying the vacated body of his creator. Although he realizes/acknowledges that his previous existence was a sham (and falling apart), he also finds himself equally despising the ugly, bland, and generally inadequate nature of the &quot;real&quot; world. He announces that he has begun to practice the craft of writing so that he might return to his fictional home in order to take back his world and his life, and end Landry&#x27;s.

== Television ==
&quot;Umney&#x27;s Last Case&quot; was included as the third installment of TNT&#x27;s &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King&quot;, starring William H. Macy in a dual role as both Umney and the author. It originally aired on July 19, 2006. Macy was nominated for an Emmy for his performance.

Jon Condit of DreadCentral rated the episode two out of five stars. Condit said that the episode deviates too highly from King&#x27;s original story, and the changes only make the story worse. Brian Pope of DVD Verdict rated it a B+ and said that Macy&#x27;s performance was worthy of an Emmy. Christopher Noseck of DVD Talk said that the episode is &quot;not completely satisfying&quot; but is the best of the episodes on that disc. Virginia Heffernan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a gonzo noir special with some postmodern curlicues&quot; that emphasizes class issues common to King&#x27;s work.

<text>Lillehammer () is a municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Gudbrandsdal. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillehammer. Some of the more notable villages in the municipality include Fåberg, Hunderfossen, Jørstadmoen, Vingnes, and Vingrom.

The municipality is the 211th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Lillehammer is the 39th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 28,560. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 6.4% over the previous 10-year period.

The town of Lillehammer is the largest urban centre in the municipality. It lies in the central part of the municipality and it is surrounded by more rural areas. The town centre is a late nineteenth-century concentration of wooden houses, which enjoys a picturesque location overlooking the northern part of lake Mjøsa and the river Lågen, surrounded by mountains.

Lillehammer hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics and 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.

==General information==
The municipality was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1906, a small adjacent area of the neighboring municipality of Fåberg (population: 140) was annexed by Lillehammer to make room for more expansion as the town grew. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Lillehammer (population: 5,905) was merged with Fåberg Municipality (population: 13,381) to form a new, larger Lillehammer Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Hamar&quot; farm () since the first Lillehammer Church was built there. The name is identical with the word which means &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;rocky hill&quot;. To distinguish it from the nearby town of Hamar and Diocese of Hamar, it began to be called &quot;little Hamar&quot;: and , and finally Lillehammer. It is also mentioned in the Old Norse sagas as (&quot;Little Trading Place&quot;).

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 4 April 1898. The arms have are divided with a diagonal line. The field (background) above the line has a tincture of blue. Below the line, the field has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The charge is a birkebeiner, carrying a spear and a shield, who is skiing down the mountainside under a blue sky. The design symbolizes the historical importance of when the Birkebeiners carried the future King Haakon from Lillehammer to Rena on skis. There is a mural crown above the escutcheon. The arms were designed by Andreas Bloch.

===Churches===

The Church of Norway has six parishes () within the municipality of Lillehammer. It is part of the Sør-Gudbrandsdal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Hamar.

==History==
The town of Lillehammer is located at the northern end of Norway&#x27;s largest lake, Mjøsa. There have likely been settlements here since the Iron Age and the market here was mentioned in Håkon Håkonson&#x27;s saga in 1390. It is also mentioned as a site for Thing assembly in 1390. Tradition states that it was here in Lillehammer where the birkebeiners Torstein Skjevla and Skjervald Skrukka joined up with the King&#x27;s son (and future King), Haakon, in 1205 before they traveled to Østerdalen (an event which is commemorated in March every year to this day). Since medieval times, the Lillehammer Church has been located here.

The town was granted market town rights on 7 August 1827. At that time, 50 people lived within the boundaries of the newly established town. This site was chosen because there were no other towns in all of Christians amt (county) and this site was located along the Gudbrandsdalslågen river and the whole Gudbrandsdal valley was a major transportation route from the capital to northern Norway. Within two years of the establishment of the town, the population had risen to 360 people. The merchant Ludvig Wiese has been counted as the founder of the town (a statue of him was erected in the town in connection with the town&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 1927). The laying of the main railway line from the capital in Christiania to Eidsvoll was completed in 1852. This railway line was connected with steamships along the lake Mjøsa which travelled to Lillehammer and from there a newly laid road made connections further up into the Gudbrandsdalen valley. This transport system made the transit of timber and agricultural goods from all over the county to the capital possible, and it contributed to the growth of the town of Lillehammer.

In 1973, Mossad killed a Moroccan waiter, having mistaken him for Palestinian terrorist Ali Hassan Salameh, which became known as the &quot;Lillehammer affair&quot;.

Lillehammer is known as a typical venue for winter sporting events; it was host city of the 1994 Winter Olympics, and the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, and was part of a joint bid with applicant host city Oslo to host events part of the 2022 Winter Olympics until Oslo withdrew its bid on 1 October 2014.

Lillehammer is home to the largest literature festival in the Nordic countries and, in 2017, was designated as a UNESCO City of Literature.

==Education==
A number of schools are located in Lillehammer, including the Hammartun Primary and Lower Secondary School, Søre Ål Primary School and Kringsjå Primary and Lower Secondary School. Lillehammer Upper Secondary School consists of two branches, North and South, both situated near the city center. The private high school Norwegian College of Elite Sports, NTG, also has a branch in Lillehammer. The Lillehammer campus of Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences is situated just north of the town itself.

Lillehammer is also the home of the Nansen Academy - the Norwegian Humanistic Academy. The Nansen Academy is an educational institution for adult students with varied political, religious, and cultural backgrounds. The Academy was founded on the core principles of humanism and aims at strengthening the knowledge of these principles.

The 14th World Scout Jamboree was held from 29 July to 7 August 1975 and was hosted by Norway at Lillehammer.

==Government==
Lillehammer Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

<doc id="64015" wikidata="Q874295" url="?curid=64015" title="Skeleton Crew (short story collection)">
<text>Skeleton Crew is a short story collection by American writer Stephen King, published by Putnam in June 1985. A limited edition of a thousand copies was published by Scream/Press in October 1985 (), illustrated by J. K. Potter, containing an additional short story, &quot;The Revelations of &#x27;Becka Paulson&quot;, which had originally appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine (July 19 – August 2, 1984), and was later incorporated into King&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;. The original title of this book was &quot;Night Moves&quot;.

==Stories==

==Overview==
The collection features 22 works, which includes eighteen short stories, two novellas (&quot;The Mist&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of The Flexible Bullet&quot;), and two poems (&quot;Paranoid: A Chant&quot; and &quot;For Owen&quot;). In addition to the introduction, in which King directly addresses his readers in his signature conversational style, &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; features an epilogue of sorts entitled &quot;Notes&quot; wherein King discusses the origins of several stories in the collection. The stories are collected from science-fiction and horror anthologies (&quot;Dark Forces&quot;, &quot;Shadows&quot;, &quot;Terrors&quot;, and &quot;New Terrors&quot;), genre magazine publications (&quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, &quot;Startling Mystery Stories&quot;, &quot;Weirdbook&quot; and &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;), and popular magazines (&quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;Gallery&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;).

Although published in 1985, the stories collected in &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; span seventeen years from &quot;The Reaper&#x27;s Image&quot; (King&#x27;s second professional sale when he was just eighteen years old) to &quot;The Ballad of The Flexible Bullet&quot; which was completed in 1983.

The collection also features some more personal works, including &quot;For Owen&quot;, the poem he wrote for his son, and &quot;Gramma&quot; a horrific tale from an eleven-year-old boy&#x27;s perspective that seems to recall King&#x27;s own horrors living with his invalid grandmother.

Of one of the stories in the collection, King says: &quot;As far as short stories are concerned, I like the grisly ones the best. However the story &quot;Survivor Type&quot; goes a little bit too far, even for me.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===

&quot;The Raft&quot; was adapted as a segment of the 1987 New World Pictures anthology film &quot;Creepshow 2&quot;, with a script by George A. Romero, and directed by Michael Gornic.

&quot;Word Processor of the Gods&quot; (1984 Laurel TV, directed by Michael Gornic) was a 22-minute episode of &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;.

&quot;Gramma&quot; was adapted into an episode of the 1985 iteration of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, written by Harlan Ellison. In 2014, it was loosely adapted into a film called &quot;Mercy&quot;, starring Chandler Riggs and Dylan McDermott.

&quot;The Mist&quot; was adapted into the film &quot;The Mist&quot; (2007 The Weinstein Company, written and directed by Frank Darabont), which was released on November 21, 2007; it was later adapted as a 2017 Spike TV series.

&quot;Survivor Type&quot; was adapted as an animated segment for a special episode of the 2019 &quot;Creepshow&quot; TV series with the main character voiced by Kiefer Sutherland.

&quot;The Jaunt&quot; will be made into a feature film by production company Plan B Entertainment, with Andy Muschietti set to direct.

A film adaptation of &quot;The Monkey&quot; directed by Osgood Perkins with James Wan as executive producer through his Atomic Monster production label is set for a theatrical release by Neon on February 21st, 2025.

In 1985, the American Library Association issued a series of posters that featured celebrities encouraging Americans to patronize their local libraries. In one of these, Michael J. Fox holds a copy of &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; while a skeletal hand rests on his shoulder.

==Reception==
Neil Gaiman reviewed &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and described it as &quot;500 pages of gorious goodies.&quot;

&quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; is critically held as showing King as a maturing writer with greater breadth and depth than his previous short works.

The book was published on the heels of &quot;The Shining&quot; (1977 Doubleday) and is King&#x27;s fifth published book (including &quot;Rage&quot;, which was published under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman). Nine of the twenty stories had first appeared in issues of &quot;Cavalier Magazine&quot; from 1970 to 1975; others were originally published in &quot;Penthouse&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Gallery&quot;, &quot;Ubris&quot;, and &quot;Maine Magazine&quot;. The stories &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;The Last Rung on the Ladder&quot;, and &quot;The Woman in the Room&quot; appeared for the first time in this collection.

King had wanted to cut &quot;Gray Matter&quot; in favor of his 1972 story &quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot;, but deferred to editor Bill Thompson who chose to keep &quot;Gray Matter&quot; in the collection (&quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot; was ultimately collected in &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; in 1993).

==Foreword and introduction==
&quot;Night Shift&quot; is the first book for which King wrote a foreword. The introduction was written by one of King&#x27;s favorite authors, John D. MacDonald. MacDonald writes that &quot;Stephen King is a far, far better writer at thirty than I was at thirty, or at forty. I am entitled to hate him a little bit for this.&quot; He adds, &quot;I will say that I do not give a diddly-whoop what Stephen King chooses as an area in which to write. The fact that he presently enjoys writing in the field of spooks and spells and slitherings in the cellar is to me the least interesting fact about the man anyone can relate&quot;, predicting that &quot;Stephen King is not going to restrict himself to his present area of intense interest.&quot;

==Deluxe edition==
In 2020, a deluxe edition of &quot;Night Shift&quot; published by Cemetery Dance Publications. The deluxe edition included two other short stories by King: &quot;The Glass Floor&quot; (1967) and &quot;Weeds&quot; (1976).

==Film, television or theatrical adaptations==
With the publication of &quot;Night Shift&quot; and the rise in King&#x27;s popularity as a best-selling author, and with the success of Brian De Palma&#x27;s motion picture adaptation of &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976), student film makers began submitting requests to King to adapt stories from the collection. King formed a policy he deemed the Dollar Deal, which allowed the students the permission to make an adaptation for $1.

In the 1980s, entrepreneurial film producer Milton Subotsky purchased the rights to six of the stories in this collection to produce feature films and a television anthology based on multiple stories. Although Subotsky was involved with several King adaptations (&quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Sometimes They Come Back&quot;, &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot;) the television series never happened due to conflicts with the networks&#x27; Standards and Practices.

<doc id="64019" wikidata="Q438298" url="?curid=64019" title="Riding the Bullet">
<text>Riding the Bullet is a horror novella by American writer Stephen King. It marked King&#x27;s debut on the Internet. Simon &amp; Schuster, with technology by SoftLock, first published &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; in 2000 as the world&#x27;s first mass-market e-book, available for download at $2.50. That year, the novella was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in Long Fiction and the International Horror Guild Award for Best Long Form. In 2002, the novella was included in King&#x27;s collection &quot;Everything&#x27;s Eventual&quot;.

==Publication==
During the first 24 hours, over 400,000 copies of &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; were downloaded, jamming SoftLock&#x27;s server. Some Stephen King fans waited hours for the download.

With over 500,000 downloads, Stephen King seemed to pave the way for the future of publishing. The actual number of readers was unclear because the encryption caused countless computers to crash.

The total financial gross of the electronic publication remains uncertain. Initially offered at $2.50 by SoftLock and then Simon &amp; Schuster, it was later available free for download from Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.

In 2009, Lonely Road Books announced the impending release of &quot;Riding the Bullet: The Deluxe Special Edition Double&quot;, by Stephen King and Mick Garris, as an oversized slipcased hardcover bound in the flip book or tête-bêche format (like an Ace Double) featuring the novella &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot;, the original script for the eponymous 2004 film by Mick Garris, and artwork by Alan M. Clark and Bernie Wrightson. The book was available in three editions:
* Collector&#x27;s Gift Edition: limited to 3000 slipcased copies (not signed)
* Limited Edition of 500 copies (signed by Mick Garris and the artist)
* Lettered Edition of 52 copies (signed by Stephen King)

==Plot summary==

Alan Parker is a student at the University of Maine who is trying to find himself. He gets a call from a neighbor in his hometown of Lewiston, telling him that his mother has been taken to the hospital after having a stroke. Lacking a functioning car, Parker decides to hitchhike the 120 miles (200 km) south to visit his mother.

He ends up riding with an old man who continually tugs at his crotch in a car that stinks of urine. Eventually frightened and glad to escape the vehicle, Alan starts walking, hitchhiking his next ride. Coming upon a graveyard, he begins to explore it and notices a headstone for a stranger named George Staub, which reads: &quot;Well Begun, Too Soon Done&quot;. Sure enough, the next car to pick him up is driven by George Staub, complete with black stitches around his neck where his head had been sewn on after being severed and wearing a button saying, &quot;I Rode The Bullet At Thrill Village, Laconia.&quot;

During the ride, George talks to Alan about the amusement park ride he was too scared to ride as a kid: The Bullet in Thrill Village, Laconia, New Hampshire. George tells Alan that before they reach the lights of town, Alan must choose who goes on the death ride with George: Alan or his mother. In a moment of fright, Alan saves himself and tells him: &quot;Take her. Take my mother.&quot;

George shoves Alan out of the car. Alan reappears alone at the graveyard, wearing the &quot;I Rode the Bullet at Thrill Village&quot; button. He eventually reaches the hospital, where he learns that despite his guilt and the impending feeling that his mother is dead or will die any moment, she is fine.

Alan takes the button and treasures it as a good (or bad) luck charm. His mother returns to work. Alan graduates and takes care of his mother for several years, and she suffers another stroke.

One day, Alan loses the button and receives a phone call; he knows what the call is about. He finds the button underneath his mother&#x27;s bed and, after a final moment of sadness, guilt, and meditation, decides to carry on. His mother&#x27;s &quot;ride&quot; is over.

==Film==
A movie adaptation of the story, starring Jonathan Jackson, Barbara Hershey and David Arquette, was released in 2004.

==Reception==
&quot;F&amp;SF&quot; (&quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;) reviewer Charles de Lint praised the novella as &quot;a terrific story, highlighting King&#x27;s gift for characterization and his sheer narrative drive.&quot; 

In contrast, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, who read the book in both available online formats (computer download and an e-book supplied by the publisher, neither of which permitted a user to print out a copy), was more critical. He disliked reading digital content on a backlit monitor (&quot;I was also restlessly aware of the unusual effort it was taking to read onscreen&quot;) and the book&#x27;s content (&quot;after getting off to such a strong start, Mr. King writes himself into a corner that makes Alan&#x27;s scary adventure seem something of a shaggy dog story&quot;). He concluded: &quot;reading &#x27;Riding the Bullet,&#x27; I sorely missed the solidity of good old print on paper. And who knows, maybe old-fashioned print would have made Mr. King&#x27;s story seem a little more substantial?&quot;

<text>Multiprocessing is the use of two or more central processing units (CPUs) within a single computer system. The term also refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor or the ability to allocate tasks between them. There are many variations on this basic theme, and the definition of multiprocessing can vary with context, mostly as a function of how CPUs are defined (multiple cores on one die, multiple dies in one package, multiple packages in one system unit, etc.).

According to some on-line dictionaries, a multiprocessor is a computer system having two or more processing units (multiple processors) each sharing main memory and peripherals, in order to simultaneously process programs. A 2009 textbook defined multiprocessor system similarly, but noted that the processors may share &quot;some or all of the system’s memory and I/O facilities&quot;; it also gave tightly coupled system as a synonymous term.

At the operating system level, &quot;multiprocessing&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the execution of multiple concurrent processes in a system, with each process running on a separate CPU or core, as opposed to a single process at any one instant. When used with this definition, multiprocessing is sometimes contrasted with multitasking, which may use just a single processor but switch it in time slices between tasks (i.e. a time-sharing system). Multiprocessing however means true parallel execution of multiple processes using more than one processor. Multiprocessing doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that a single process or task uses more than one processor simultaneously; the term parallel processing is generally used to denote that scenario. Other authors prefer to refer to the operating system techniques as multiprogramming and reserve the term &quot;multiprocessing&quot; for the hardware aspect of having more than one processor. The remainder of this article discusses multiprocessing only in this hardware sense.

In Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy, multiprocessors as defined above are MIMD machines. As the term &quot;multiprocessor&quot; normally refers to tightly coupled systems in which all processors share memory, multiprocessors are not the entire class of MIMD machines, which also contains message passing multicomputer systems.

== Key topics ==

===Processor symmetry===

In a multiprocessing system, all CPUs may be equal, or some may be reserved for special purposes. A combination of hardware and operating system software design considerations determine the symmetry (or lack thereof) in a given system. For example, hardware or software considerations may require that only one particular CPU respond to all hardware interrupts, whereas all other work in the system may be distributed equally among CPUs; or execution of kernel-mode code may be restricted to only one particular CPU, whereas user-mode code may be executed in any combination of processors. Multiprocessing systems are often easier to design if such restrictions are imposed, but they tend to be less efficient than systems in which all CPUs are utilized.

Systems that treat all CPUs equally are called symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems. In systems where all CPUs are not equal, system resources may be divided in a number of ways, including asymmetric multiprocessing (ASMP), non-uniform memory access (NUMA) multiprocessing, and clustered multiprocessing.

====Master/slave multiprocessor system====
In a master/slave multiprocessor system, the master CPU is in control of the computer and the slave CPU(s) performs assigned tasks. The CPUs can be completely different in terms of speed and architecture. Some (or all) of the CPUs can share a common bus, each can also have a private bus (for private resources), or they may be isolated except for a common communications pathway. Likewise, the CPUs can share common RAM and/or have private RAM that the other processor(s) cannot access. The roles of master and slave can change from one CPU to another.

Two early examples of a mainframe master/slave multiprocessor are the Bull Gamma 60 and the Burroughs B5000.

An early example of a master/slave multiprocessor system of microprocessors is the Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 16 desktop computer which came out in February 1982 and ran the multi-user/multi-tasking Xenix operating system, Microsoft&#x27;s version of UNIX (called TRS-XENIX). The Model 16 has two microprocessors: an 8-bit Zilog Z80 CPU running at 4 MHz, and a 16-bit Motorola 68000 CPU running at 6 MHz. When the system is booted, the Z-80 is the master and the Xenix boot process initializes the slave 68000, and then transfers control to the 68000, whereupon the CPUs change roles and the Z-80 becomes a slave processor responsible for all I/O operations including disk, communications, printer and network, as well as the keyboard and integrated monitor, while the operating system and applications run on the 68000 CPU. The Z-80 can be used to do other tasks.

The earlier TRS-80 Model II, which was released in 1979, could also be considered a multiprocessor system as it had both a Z-80 CPU and an Intel 8021 microcontroller in the keyboard. The 8021 made the Model II the first desktop computer system with a separate detachable lightweight keyboard connected with by a single thin flexible wire, and likely the first keyboard to use a dedicated microcontroller, both attributes that would later be copied years later by Apple and IBM.

===Instruction and data streams===

In multiprocessing, the processors can be used to execute a single sequence of instructions in multiple contexts (single instruction, multiple data or SIMD, often used in vector processing), multiple sequences of instructions in a single context (multiple instruction, single data or MISD, used for redundancy in fail-safe systems and sometimes applied to describe pipelined processors or hyper-threading), or multiple sequences of instructions in multiple contexts (multiple instruction, multiple data or MIMD).

===Processor coupling===

====Tightly coupled multiprocessor system====
Tightly coupled multiprocessor systems contain multiple CPUs that are connected at the bus level. These CPUs may have access to a central shared memory (SMP or UMA), or may participate in a memory hierarchy with both local and shared memory (SM)(NUMA). The IBM p690 Regatta is an example of a high end SMP system. Intel Xeon processors dominated the multiprocessor market for business PCs and were the only major x86 option until the release of AMD&#x27;s Opteron range of processors in 2004. Both ranges of processors had their own onboard cache but provided access to shared memory; the Xeon processors via a common pipe and the Opteron processors via independent pathways to the system RAM.

Chip multiprocessors, also known as multi-core computing, involves more than one processor placed on a single chip and can be thought of the most extreme form of tightly coupled multiprocessing. Mainframe systems with multiple processors are often tightly coupled.

====Loosely coupled multiprocessor system====

Loosely coupled multiprocessor systems (often referred to as clusters) are based on multiple standalone relatively low processor count commodity computers interconnected via a high speed communication system (Gigabit Ethernet is common). A Linux Beowulf cluster is an example of a loosely coupled system.

Tightly coupled systems perform better and are physically smaller than loosely coupled systems, but have historically required greater initial investments and may depreciate rapidly; nodes in a loosely coupled system are usually inexpensive commodity computers and can be recycled as independent machines upon retirement from the cluster.

Power consumption is also a consideration. Tightly coupled systems tend to be much more energy-efficient than clusters. This is because a considerable reduction in power consumption can be realized by designing components to work together from the beginning in tightly coupled systems, whereas loosely coupled systems use components that were not necessarily intended specifically for use in such systems.

Loosely coupled systems have the ability to run different operating systems or OS versions on different systems.

<doc id="64022" wikidata="Q42642" url="?curid=64022" title="Selkirk Rex">
<text>The Selkirk Rex is a breed of cat with highly curled hair.

==Background==

The Selkirk Rex is distinct from all other Rex breeds. Unlike the Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, the hair is of normal length and not partly missing. There are longhair and shorthair varieties. It differs from the LaPerm in that the Selkirk Rex coat is plusher and thicker. While the LaPerm gene is a simple dominant, the Selkirk gene (Se) acts as an incomplete dominant; incompletely dominant allele pairs produce three possible genotypes and phenotypes: heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show ring, while homozygous cats (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume.

The Selkirk Rex originated in Montana, USA in 1987, with a litter born to a rescued cat. The only unusually coated kitten in the litter was ultimately placed with breeder Jeri Newman, who named her Miss DiPesto (after a curly-haired character in the TV series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; played by Allyce Beasley). This foundation cat was bred to a black Persian tomcat, producing three Selkirk Rex and three straight-haired kittens. This demonstrated that the gene had an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. All Selkirk Rex trace their ancestry back to the cat Miss DiPesto. Jeri Newman named the breed after her stepfather, &quot;Selkirk,&quot; making this the first (and currently only) breed of cat to be named after an actual person.

The breed has been developed in two coat lengths, long and short. It is a large and solidly built breed, similar to a British Shorthair. The coat is very soft and has a woolly look and feel with loose, unstructured curls. The head is round, with large rounded eyes, medium-sized ears, and a distinct muzzle, whose length is equal to half its width. An extreme break, like that of a Persian, is a disqualifiable fault.

American Shorthairs, Persians, Himalayans, Exotic Shorthairs, and British Shorthairs have been used as outcrosses to develop this breed. The American Shorthair has now been discontinued as an outcross, except in The International Cat Association (TICA). The breed was accepted by The International Cat Association in 1992, the American Cat Fanciers Association in 1998, and the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association in 2000. In Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) and in Australia, all outcrosses are scheduled to be discontinued in 2015.

The breed is accepted in all colors, including the pointed, sepia, and mink varieties of albinism; bicolors; cinnamon; silver/smoke; and the chocolate and lilac series. This breed has an extremely dense coat and high propensity for shedding. Unlike other Rex breeds with reduced amounts of hair, the Selkirk Rex is not recommended for those who might be allergic to cat allergens.

The temperament of the Selkirk Rex reflects that of the breeds used in its development. They have a lot of the laid-back, reserved qualities of the British Shorthair, the cuddly nature of the Persian, and the playfulness of the Exotic Shorthair.

There are no known health problems specific to the Selkirk Rex breed. They are a robust breed. Breeding towards proper head structure is necessary to prevent kinking of the tear ducts, resulting in tear run down the front of the face, or muzzle creases that can result in dermatitis on the face. Like other Rex breeds, irritation of the inside of the ear by curly fur can occur, increasing the production of ear wax. Homozygous cats (with two copies of the dominant Selkirk Rex gene) may have a tendency towards excessive greasiness of the coat, requiring increased frequency of bathing. Other health problems may be inherited from the outcross breeds used, including polycystic kidney disease from Persians and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from British Shorthairs. Responsible breeders screen their breeding cats for these diseases to minimize their impact on the breed.

In the UK, all Selkirk Rex registered with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) for breeding are genetically tested for Polycystic Kidney Disease or are from two genetically tested parents.

== Genetics ==
The Selkirk Rex is defined by an autosomal dominant woolly rexoid hair (ADWH) abnormality that is characterized by tightly curled hair shafts. A splice variant in the gene KRT71 was found to be associated with the curly coat phenotype. KRT71 is a crucial gene for keratinization of the hair follicle. An allele of this gene is also responsible for the hairless (hr) Sphynx and the Devon Rex (re) hair. Three mutations in KRT71 have now been identified in cats, forming the allelic series, KRT71SADRE &gt; KRT71+ &gt; KRT71re &gt; KRT71hr, where SADRE is the suggested locus designation for the Selkirk autosomal dominant rex
21 allele.

<text>Blood and Smoke (1999) is an audiobook in which Stephen King reads three of his own short stories. At the time, King said that the two short stories which had not been published wouldn&#x27;t be, but all three appeared in the &quot;Everything&#x27;s Eventual&quot; collection.

All three stories in &quot;Blood and Smoke&quot; involve smoking in one way or another. The audiobook packaging resembles a pack of cigarettes, including the flip top.

<text>Dolores Claiborne () is a 1992 psychological thriller novel by Stephen King. The novel is narrated by the title character. Atypically for a King novel, it has no chapters, double-spacing between paragraphs, or other section breaks; thus, the text is a single continuous narrative, which reads like the transcription of a spoken monologue. It was the best-selling novel of 1992 in the United States. The story introduced the fictional community of Little Tall Island, which Stephen King later used as the setting for the original TV mini-series &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;.

The novel was highly successful in 1992 and received overall positive reviews.

==Plot summary==
Dolores Claiborne, an opinionated 65-year-old widow living on the tiny Maine community of Little Tall Island, is suspected of murdering her wealthy, elderly employer, Vera Donovan. The novel is presented as a transcript of her statement, told to the local constable and a stenographer. Dolores wants to make clear to the police that she did not kill Vera, whom she has looked after for years, but does confess to orchestrating the death of her husband, Joe St. George, almost thirty years before. Dolores&#x27;s confession develops into the story of her life, her troubled marriage, and her relationship with her employer. 

Dolores first describes her relationship with Vera, which began when she and her millionaire husband purchased a summer home on Little Tall Island in 1949 and hired Dolores as a maid. Able to cope with Vera&#x27;s brutally exacting standards, Dolores rises from maid to housekeeper at the Donovan home. After Vera&#x27;s husband dies in a car crash in 1960, she spends increasing time at her island house, eventually moving there permanently. Vera suffers a series of strokes in the 1980s, whereupon Dolores becomes the woman&#x27;s live-in caretaker and reluctant companion. As the wealthy woman slips into dementia, Dolores comforts her from terrifying hallucinations of a force she calls &quot;the dust bunnies.&quot; When Vera is lucid, Dolores combats a series of mind games and power plays. 

Dolores further reveals that when she began working at the Donovan house, her marriage to Joe was already in distress due to his alcoholism, temper, and domestic violence. Their children, Selena, Joe Jr. and Pete, are unaware of the abuse. The marriage problems escalate one night in 1960 when Joe viciously hits Dolores in the back with a piece of stove wood over a perceived slight. In retaliation, Dolores smashes a ceramic cream pot over his head and threatens him with a hatchet, swearing she will kill him if he ever strikes her again. This confrontation is witnessed by Selena. Joe stops beating Dolores, but Selena does not realize Dolores was abused and acted in self-defense, and Joe uses the hatchet incident to gain sympathy from her. A rift grows between mother and daughter.

In 1962, Dolores notices Selena has become increasingly withdrawn, frightened, unsociable and neglectful of her appearance. After speculating she has met a boy or become involved in drugs, Dolores finally confronts her daughter as they return home on the island ferry. She explains the truth of the hatchet incident and Selena reluctantly admits that Joe molested her. Overwhelmed, Selena nearly jumps off the side of the ferry, but Dolores stops her and vows to protect her. That night, she considers murdering Joe, describing the urge to kill him as the opening of an &quot;inside eye.&quot; Instead, she confronts him, promising to have him arrested if he ever touches Selena again. 

Dolores resolves to protect her children by leaving Joe. When she attempts to withdraw her children&#x27;s savings accounts to fund their escape, she discovers Joe has stolen everything. In despair, she breaks down crying at work, confiding in Vera. An unusually sympathetic Vera reveals she has had some sort of experience with Dolores&#x27;s &quot;inside eye&quot;, and casually remarks that men like Joe often die in accidents, leaving their wives everything. As she departs, she implies she arranged the car crash that killed her own husband and advises Dolores that &quot;sometimes, an accident can be an unhappy woman&#x27;s best friend.&quot;

Dolores begins plotting Joe&#x27;s death, but she does not find an opportunity to execute her plan until the following summer. Vera becomes obsessed with a total solar eclipse that will be visible from the island, insisting the event will convince her estranged children to visit her. She plans a massive viewing party on the island ferry. Knowing the island will be mostly empty at that time, Dolores ensures Selena is sent to camp, and Joe Jr. and Pete are sent on to visit family on the mainland. Dolores marks the location of a dried-up well in a patch of brambles on the edge of their property. When it becomes clear her children will not be joining her for the eclipse, Vera becomes despondent and lashes out at her hired help, calming only after Dolores confronts her over the unjust firing of one of the maids. 

On the day of the eclipse, Dolores buys Joe a bottle of scotch and makes him a sandwich, lowering his guard, and they share their first moment of physical affection in many years. As the eclipse begins, Dolores has a vision of a young girl in the path of the eclipse who is being sexually abused by her father at that same moment. Reminded of what she has set out to do, she deliberately enrages Joe by claiming she has recovered the money he had stolen, provoking him into attacking her. She flees into the brambles, leading Joe to the well and tricking him into stepping on the rotted boards that cover it. The planks break and Joe falls into the well, severely injured. 

Joe calls out for help for some time before eventually losing consciousness. Dolores returns to the house and falls asleep. She has a nightmare, then checks the well. She arrives to discover Joe has regained consciousness and has nearly managed to climb out. He grabs at Dolores and attempts to pull her in with him. She hits him in the face with a rock, and he falls back into the well, dead.

Dolores reports Joe missing, and his body is found after several days of searching. His death is ruled an accident despite the suspicions of the local coroner. Dolores is free of Joe, but her actions damage her relationship with Selena, who also suspects her mother, and rumors begin to circulate that she has gotten away with murder.

The narration finally comes to the circumstances of Vera&#x27;s death, an incident which has led Dolores to tell her story. She confesses that Vera, in one of her hallucinations, managed to exit her wheelchair and fled in terror from &quot;the dust bunnies&quot;, falling down a flight of stairs. As she falls, Dolores has a terrifying vision of Joe&#x27;s ghost, covered in dust. Somehow alive and lucid despite her injuries, Vera begs Dolores to help end her suffering. Dolores fetches a rolling pin, but Vera dies before she can use it. The incriminating scene is discovered by the local mailman, who suspects Dolores of killing the old woman and forces her to call the police. 

That night, Dolores is harassed by members of the community who believe she has already escaped punishment for murder in the past. The next day, she receives a phone call from Vera&#x27;s lawyer, who informs a shocked Dolores that she has inherited Vera&#x27;s entire fortune—nearly $30 million. Dolores initially refuses the money in favor of Vera&#x27;s estranged children, but then learns they were killed in a car crash in 1961, and Vera had spent the last thirty years of her life only pretending they were still alive. Knowing the inheritance will be seen as a motive and worsen the case against her, Dolores convinces herself the only way to clear her name is to confess everything. Feeling at peace with herself at long last, she ends her statement. 

Several newspaper articles provide an epilogue to the story, revealing Dolores was cleared of any blame in Vera&#x27;s death and anonymously donated Vera&#x27;s fortune to the New England Home for Little Wanderers. The final article implies Dolores and Selena have reconciled and that Selena will be coming home for the first time in twenty years.

==Style==
Unlike many other works by King, little focus is given to the supernatural. Although several supernatural occurrences are implied, the only such events that clearly occur in the book are two telepathic visions of a nameless young girl sexually victimized by her father, which, along with the solar eclipse backdrop, form a link to King&#x27;s novel &quot;Gerald&#x27;s Game.&quot;

==Characters==

*Dolores Claiborne – The novel&#x27;s narrator and protagonist, she is a 65-year-old housekeeper. Caustic but not embittered by a lifetime of hard work and suffering, she is forced to confront her past sins to clear her name of a murder she did not commit. Despite expressing disparaging sentiments against President Kennedy throughout the novel, she is disclosed to be a registered Democrat near the novel&#x27;s end.

*Vera Donovan – Dolores&#x27;s employer and a demanding, high-handed woman (in Dolores&#x27;s phrasing, &quot;a high-riding bitch&quot;), she has a fanatical devotion to her complicated household procedures and will fire her hired help for the smallest of mistakes; Vera unexpectedly becomes Dolores&#x27;s only ally in her battle to free herself from Joe. Vera is revealed to have orchestrated the car crash that killed her unfaithful husband. As an elderly woman, she suffers a series of strokes and spends the last years of her life in an increasingly addled state, and Dolores&#x27;s position shifts from housekeeper to caretaker. When lucid, she gains amusement by inconveniencing Dolores anyway she can, even deliberately soiling herself and her bedding so Dolores will be forced to clean her. She suffers from terrifying visions and hallucinations she calls &quot;the dust bunnies&quot;, which she implies take the form of her dead husband and children, and which eventually lead to her death.

*Joe St. George – Dolores&#x27;s husband, she marries him directly out of high school. Inconsistently employed, racist, and both verbally and physically abusive to his family, Joe eventually begins sexually abusing his daughter, which leads Dolores to kill him.

*Selena St. George – Dolores&#x27;s and Joe&#x27;s daughter, and extremely bright and friendly as a girl, she is an honor student by the time she is in high school. After witnessing her mother threaten her father at the age of 12, she misunderstands the situation and becomes more sympathetic to Joe, who takes advantage of her kindness and begins molesting her. She becomes withdrawn and verges on the edge of suicide before Dolores manages to put a stop to the abuse. After Joe&#x27;s death, Selena directly asks her mother if she killed him, which Dolores denies, but Selena is left questioning her mother&#x27;s guilt. As an adult, Selena moves to New York and becomes a well-known journalist, but struggles with alcoholism and becomes distant from her mother. The novel&#x27;s epilogue implies that they are beginning to reconcile.

*Joe St. George Jr. – Dolores and Joe&#x27;s older son, he is harassed and belittled by his father for his intelligence, sensitivity, and lack of physical prowess, and by the time of Joe&#x27;s death, his son actively despises him.

*Donald and Helga Donovan – Vera&#x27;s children, they are last seen by Dolores in 1961, when Donald is 16 and Helga is 14, after an argument in which Vera refuses to let Helga get a driver&#x27;s license. Dolores speculates that they were aware or suspicious of their mother&#x27;s role in their father&#x27;s death and may even have been blackmailing her. Vera spends years telling Dolores they are estranged and creates elaborate lies of their current careers and families, but after her death, it emerges that they had died several months after Dolores last saw them, having veered off the road in a car driven by Helga.

*Ted Kenopensky – Vera&#x27;s handyman and occasional lover, Dolores refers to him as &quot;the Hunky&quot;. Dolores believes he conspired with Vera to kill her husband. He is killed in a car crash shortly after Vera&#x27;s health begins to fail.

*Mr. Pease – A banker, he unwillingly helps Dolores discover what Joe has done with the money he has stolen from her children&#x27;s college funds. In doing so, he shares confidential information with her against regulations, and after Joe&#x27;s death, he does not come forward to share his knowledge of Dolores&#x27;s motives for murder, which Dolores believes is out of fear of his own culpability. 

*Dr. John McAuliffe – The county medical examiner, he examines Joe&#x27;s body. A small, fastidious Scotsman, he suspects Dolores of killing her husband and harshly interrogates her prior to the official inquest, nearly cornering her with discrepancies in her story. He is eventually forced to enter a verdict of accidental death, which he does unwillingly. 

*Garrett Thibodeau – The town constable, he investigates Joe&#x27;s death. Friendly, empathetic, and not too bright, he cannot help himself from derailing McAuliffe&#x27;s interrogation of Dolores. As a result, she is not charged with Joe&#x27;s death.

*Sammy Marchant – The island&#x27;s dimwitted mailman, he discovers Dolores standing over Vera&#x27;s dead body. He immediately suspects her of murder and is responsible for the rumors that begin to spread, eventually convincing Dolores to make her confession to the police.

*Andy Bissette, Nancy Bannister, and Frank Proulx – The police chief, stenographer, and officer, respectively, they are in the room listening to Dolores&#x27;s confession. None of their dialogue is included in the novel, which is presented as a transcript of Dolores&#x27;s statement, but Dolores frequently addresses them.

<doc id="64025" wikidata="Q629445" url="?curid=64025" title="Gerald's Game">
<text>Gerald&#x27;s Game is a 1992 suspense novel by American writer Stephen King. The story is about a woman whose husband dies of a heart attack while she is handcuffed to a bed, and, following the subsequent realization that she is trapped with little hope of rescue, begins to let the voices inside her head take over.

The book is dedicated to King&#x27;s wife Tabitha and her five sisters. Originally, the book was intended to be a companion piece to King&#x27;s novel &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;, with the connecting theme of two women in crisis caught in the path of an eclipse, though this aspect was greatly reduced by the time the books were published. The book was adapted into a 2017 film directed by Mike Flanagan.

==Plot==

Jessie Burlingame and her husband Gerald, a successful lawyer, travel from Portland to their secluded lake house in western Maine near Kashwakamak Lake for a spontaneous romantic getaway. The titular &quot;game&quot; involves handcuffing Jessie to the bedposts during sex, a new practice that Jessie only pretends to enjoy, though Gerald finds it exciting. This time, however, Jessie finds herself reluctant after being handcuffed and asks to stop. She is ignored by Gerald, who pretends her protests are only part of their game. Realizing her husband is deliberately feigning ignorance and that he intends to rape her, Jessie lashes out, kicking Gerald in the stomach and groin. The shock causes him to have a fatal heart attack. He dies, leaving Jessie handcuffed to the bed.

At first, Jessie is horrified at her husband&#x27;s death and fears the humiliation of being discovered semi-naked and handcuffed, but she realizes the situation is far more dire: it is unlikely that she or Gerald will be missed for several days, no one will think to look for them at the lake house, and all the usual lake residents have gone for the season. There is a possibility that Jessie will die if she cannot escape.

While Jessie frantically considers her options, a combination of panic and thirst causes her to hallucinate voices: &quot;The Goodwife&quot; or &quot;Goody Burlingame,&quot; a Puritanical version of herself that insists things will be fine and that she should wait to be rescued; &quot;Punkin&quot;, a representation of Jessie as a 10-year-old girl; Ruth Neary, a college roommate whom Jessie abandoned after a conversation that strayed dangerously close to uncovering Jessie&#x27;s childhood trauma; and Nora, Jessie&#x27;s former psychologist, whom Jessie likewise abandoned when Nora questioned Jessie&#x27;s relationship with her father. 

Guided by these voices, Jessie realizes that Goody&#x27;s advice to wait for rescue stems from a subconscious belief that she deserves to be trapped in this situation, even if it means her death. When she probes for the reason why, she is able to recall a long-repressed memory of being sexually abused by her father during a solar eclipse when she was ten. Jessie&#x27;s father manipulated Jessie into believing that she was complicit, resulting in lifelong feelings of shame and guilt. She remembers an inexplicable event in the aftermath of the abuse, during which she experienced a momentary psychic connection with an unknown woman (&quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;). The memories cause Jessie to acknowledge how unhappy and controlling her marriage to Gerald was, leading her to suspect she gave up her independence for the security of being Gerald&#x27;s trophy wife.

Waking from an imaginary confrontation with all these characters to a dark bedroom, Jessie sees a tall, gaunt apparition whom she initially mistakes for the spirit of her long-dead father and whom she nicknames &quot;Space Cowboy&quot; (after a 1969 Steve Miller song). The figure shows her a wicker basket of jewelry mixed with human bones. Unsure if the figure is another hallucination, Jessie dismisses it, saying aloud it is &quot;only made of moonlight&quot;, which seems to make it vanish. Her inner voices, however, believe the figure is real and that it will return to harm Jessie if she does not escape by the next night.

The following morning, Jessie manages to secure a drink of water from a glass on the bedside table. Refreshed and encouraged by her own ingenuity in getting the water, she renews her efforts to escape, first by trying to break the headboard, then by trying to slip off the bed and push it to the bureau where the keys are placed. Inspired by her memory of the eclipse, in which her father warned her not to cut herself on the smoked glass panes they used as eclipse viewers, Jessie breaks the water glass and uses a sharp shard to slice her wrist, giving herself a degloving injury to lubricate her skin enough to slide her right hand from the cuff. She is able to escape the bed, reach the keys, and free her other hand, but faints from blood loss. When she awakens, it is nearly dark and the Space Cowboy has returned. Jessie throws her wedding ring at his box of jewelry and bones, thinking that is what he wanted all along. Still weak from blood loss, she reaches her car and drives away, with the Space Cowboy hidden in the back seat. Jessie crashes and is knocked unconscious.

Months later, Jessie is recuperating from her ordeal. An attorney at Gerald&#x27;s law firm assists her in covering up the incident to protect her and the firm from scandal, but Jessie feels this is another version of burying her trauma, just as she buried her childhood abuse. To free herself, Jessie writes to the real Ruth, with whom she has not spoken in decades, detailing what really happened at the lake house and subsequent events. The &quot;Space Cowboy&quot; had turned out to be a serial killer and necrophile named Raymond Andrew Joubert who had been robbing and squatting in lake houses in the area. Jessie confronts Joubert at his court hearing, where he mocks her &quot;made of moonlight&quot; statement, confirming that the encounter really occurred and causing Jessie to spit in his face. Being able to directly confront the man who once terrified her allows Jessie to face the other manipulative men in her life, freeing her of fear and allowing her to deal more honestly with her past. She apologizes for abandoning Ruth, acknowledging that Ruth had confronted her with a truth she could not face, and hopes they can resume their friendship. After mailing the letter, Jessie is able to sleep without nightmares for the first time since her ordeal at the lake house.

== Film adaptation ==

In May 2014, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Mike Flanagan had been set to direct a film adaptation. In an interview with Rue Morgue in September 2016, Flanagan said that the film adaptation would premiere on Netflix. In October 2016, Deadline reported that Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood would star in the film as Jessie and Gerald Burlingame. On October 17, 2016, Flanagan tweeted indicating the first day of production had begun. The film premiered on Netflix on September 29, 2017.

<text>The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (1999) is a psychological horror novel by American writer Stephen King. In 2004, a pop-up book adaptation was released with design by Kees Moerbeek and illustration by Alan Dingman. A film adaptation to be produced by Chris Romero was announced in 2019.

== Plot summary ==

The story is set in motion by a family hiking trip, during which Trisha&#x27;s brother, Pete, and mother constantly squabble about the mother&#x27;s divorce from their father, as well as other topics. Trisha falls back to avoid listening and is therefore unable to find her family again after she wanders off the trail to take a bathroom break. Trying to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she slips and falls down a steep embankment and ends up hopelessly lost, heading deeper into the heart of the forest. She is left with a bottle of water, two Twinkies, a boiled egg, celery sticks, a tuna sandwich, a bottle of Surge, a poncho, a Game Boy, and a Walkman. She listens to her Walkman to keep her mood up, either to learn of news of the search for her, or to listen to the baseball game featuring her favorite player, and &quot;heartthrob&quot;, Tom Gordon.

As she starts to take steps to survive by conserving what little food she has with her while consuming edible flora, Trisha&#x27;s family return to their car without her and call the police to start a search. The rescuers search in the area around the path, but not as far as Trisha has gone. The girl decides to follow a creek because of what she read in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; (though it soon turns into a swamp-like river), rationalizing that all bodies of water lead eventually to inhabited areas.

As the cops stop searching for the night, she huddles up underneath a tree to rest. Eventually, a combination of fear, hunger, and thirst causes Trisha to hallucinate. She imagines several people from her life, as well as her hero, Tom Gordon, appearing to her.

Hours and soon days begin to pass, with Trisha wandering further into the woods. Eventually, Trisha begins to believe that she is headed for a confrontation with the God of the Lost, a wasp-faced evil entity who is hunting her down. Her trial becomes a test of a 9-year-old girl&#x27;s ability to maintain sanity in the face of seemingly certain death. Wracked with pneumonia and near death, she comes upon a road, but just as she discovers signs of civilization, she&#x27;s confronted by a bear, which she interprets as the God of the Lost in disguise. Facing down her fear, she realizes it&#x27;s the bottom of the ninth, and she must close the game. In imitation of Tom Gordon, she takes a pitcher&#x27;s stance and throws her Walkman like a baseball, hitting the bear in the face, and startling it enough to make it back away. A hunter, who has come upon the confrontation between girl and beast, frightens the animal away and takes Trisha to safety, but Trisha knows that she earned her rescue.

Trisha wakes up in a hospital room. She finds her divorced parents and older brother waiting near her bedside. A nurse tells the girl&#x27;s family that they must leave so that Trisha can rest because &quot;her numbers are up and we don&#x27;t want that&quot;. Her father is the last to leave. Before he does Trisha asks him to hand her a Red Sox hat (autographed by Tom Gordon) and she points towards the sky, just as Tom Gordon does when he closes a game.

==Film adaptation==
Although George A. Romero was attached to write and direct a film adaptation, plans for it stalled in October 2005 before his death.

In August 2019, the project was revived, with Romero&#x27;s production company still attached. Involved parties with the new production include Chris Romero as producer, &quot;It&quot; producer Roy Lee, Jon Berg of Vertigo Entertainment and Ryan Silbert of Origin Story. The production company is Sanibel Films, the production company of Chris Romero and her late husband George Romero. As of the announcement on August 21, 2019, a writer or director had yet to be announced. Andrew Childs serves as executive producer. On November 16, 2020, it was announced that Lynne Ramsay had been picked to direct the film.

<doc id="64027" wikidata="Q2426764" url="?curid=64027" title="The Breathing Method">
<text>The Breathing Method is a novella by American writer Stephen King, originally released as part of his &quot;Different Seasons&quot; collection in 1982. It is placed in the section entitled &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. It is the only one of the four stories in the collection not to have been adapted for film.

==Plot==
David, the narrator of the frame tale, is a middle-aged Manhattan lawyer. At the invitation of a senior partner, he joins a strange gentlemen&#x27;s club where the members, in addition to reading, chatting and playing billiards and chess, like to tell stories, some of which range into the bizarre and macabre.

One Thursday before Christmas, the elderly physician Dr. Emlyn McCarron tells a story about an episode that took place early in his long and varied career: that of a patient, Sandra Stansfield, who was determined to give birth to her illegitimate child, no matter what, despite financial problems and social disapproval. McCarron comes to admire her bravery and humor, and the implication is that he has even fallen a bit in love with her.

Sandra masters Dr. McCarron&#x27;s unusual (for the 1930s) breathing method intended to help her through childbirth. However, when she goes into labor and is on the way to the hospital on an icy winter night, her taxi crashes and she is decapitated. McCarron arrives at the crash site and realizes that Sandra is somehow still alive. Her lungs in her decapitated body are still pumping air, as her head, some feet away, is working to sustain the breathing method so that the baby can be born. McCarron manages to deliver the infant alive and well.

On a sweet but haunting end note, Sandra whispers &quot;Thank you&quot;—her severed head mouthing the words, which are distortedly heard from the throat jutting from her headless body. McCarron is able to tell her that her baby is a boy and to see that she has registered this before she dies. McCarron and his office nurse pay for the woman&#x27;s burial, for she has no one else.

The child is adopted, and despite the confidential nature of adoption records, McCarron is able to keep track of him over the years. When the man is &quot;not yet 45&quot;, and an accomplished college professor, McCarron arranges to meet him socially. &quot;He had his mother&#x27;s determination, gentlemen,&quot; he tells the club members, &quot;and his mother&#x27;s hazel eyes.&quot;

== Relation to other works ==
Like King&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands&quot;, &quot;The Breathing Method&quot; takes the form of a nested narrative told in a strange &#x27;club&#x27; in Manhattan.

==Reception==
&quot;The Breathing Method&quot; was a finalist for the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Best Novella.

==Adaptation==
A film adaptation of &quot;The Breathing Method&quot; was announced in 2012 as being in development, with Scott Derrickson directing and Scott Teems screenwriting. Later, in 2019, another announcement was made, again involving Derrickson. the project has remained in development hell.

<doc id="64028" wikidata="Q1868547" url="?curid=64028" title="Locality of reference">
<text>In computer science, locality of reference, also known as the principle of locality, is the tendency of a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time. There are two basic types of reference locality temporal and spatial locality. Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data and/or resources within a relatively small time duration. Spatial locality (also termed &quot;data locality&quot;) refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations. Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when data elements are arranged and accessed linearly, such as traversing the elements in a one-dimensional [[Array data structure|array].

Locality is a type of [[predictability|predictable]] behavior that occurs in computer systems. Systems that exhibit strong &quot;locality of reference&quot; are great candidates for performance optimization through the use of techniques such as the [[CPU cache|caching]], [[prefetch instruction|prefetching]] for memory and advanced [[branch predictor]]s of a processor core.

== Types of locality ==
There are several different types of locality of reference:

* Temporal locality: If at one point a particular memory location is referenced, then it is likely that the same location will be referenced again in the near future. There is temporal proximity between adjacent references to the same memory location. In this case it is common to make efforts to store a copy of the referenced data in faster memory storage, to reduce the latency of subsequent references. Temporal locality is a special case of spatial locality (see below), namely when the prospective location is identical to the present location.
* Spatial locality: If a particular storage location is referenced at a particular time, then it is likely that nearby memory locations will be referenced in the near future. In this case it is common to attempt to guess the size and shape of the area around the current reference for which it is worthwhile to prepare faster access for subsequent reference.
** Memory locality (or &quot;data locality&quot;): Spatial locality explicitly relating to [[computer memory|memory]].
* [[Branch (computer science)|Branch]] locality: If there are only a few possible alternatives for the prospective part of the path in the spatial-temporal coordinate space. This is the case when an instruction loop has a simple structure, or the possible outcome of a small system of conditional branching instructions is restricted to a small set of possibilities. Branch locality is typically not spatial locality since the few possibilities can be located far away from each other.
* Equidistant locality: Halfway between spatial locality and branch locality. Consider a loop accessing locations in an equidistant pattern, i.e., the path in the spatial-temporal coordinate space is a dotted line. In this case, a simple linear function can predict which location will be accessed in the near future.

In order to benefit from temporal and spatial locality, which occur frequently, most of the information storage systems are [[Computer data storage#Hierarchy of storage|hierarchical]]. Equidistant locality is usually supported by a processor&#x27;s diverse nontrivial increment instructions. For branch locality, the contemporary processors have sophisticated branch predictors, and on the basis of this prediction the memory manager of the processor tries to collect and preprocess the data of plausible alternatives.

== Relevance ==
There are several reasons for locality. These reasons are either goals to achieve or circumstances to accept, depending on the aspect. The reasons below are not [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]]; in fact, the list below goes from the most general case to special cases:

* Predictability: Locality is merely one type of predictable behavior in computer systems.
* Structure of the program: Locality occurs often because of the way in which computer programs are created, for handling decidable problems. Generally, related data is stored in nearby locations in storage. One common pattern in computing involves the processing of several items, one at a time. This means that if a lot of processing is done, the single item will be accessed more than once, thus leading to temporal locality of reference. Furthermore, moving to the next item implies that the next item will be read, hence spatial locality of reference, since memory locations are typically read in batches.
* Linear data structures: Locality often occurs because code contains loops that tend to reference arrays or other data structures by indices. Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when relevant data elements are arranged and accessed linearly. For example, the simple traversal of elements in a one-dimensional array, from the base address to the highest element would exploit the sequential locality of the array in memory. Equidistant locality occurs when the linear traversal is over a longer area of adjacent [[data structure]]s with identical structure and size, accessing mutually corresponding elements of each structure rather than each entire structure. This is the case when a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is represented as a sequential matrix of rows and the requirement is to access a single column of the matrix.
* Efficiency of memory hierarchy use: Although [[random-access memory]] presents the programmer with the ability to read or write anywhere at any time, in practice [[latency (engineering)|latency]] and throughput are affected by the efficiency of the [[Cache (computing)|cache]], which is improved by increasing the locality of reference. Poor locality of reference results in cache [[Thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] and [[cache pollution]] and to avoid it, data elements with poor locality can be bypassed from cache.

== General usage ==
If most of the time the substantial portion of the references aggregate into clusters, and if the shape of this system of clusters can be well predicted, then it can be used for performance optimization. There are several ways to benefit from locality using [[optimization (computer science)|optimization]] techniques. Common techniques are:

* Increasing the locality of references (generally on the software side)
* Exploiting the locality of references: Generally achieved on the hardware side, temporal and spatial locality can be capitalized by hierarchical storage hardware. The equidistant locality can be used by the appropriately specialized instructions of the processors, this possibility is not only the responsibility of hardware, but the software as well, whether its structure is suitable for compiling a binary program that calls the specialized instructions in question. The branch locality is a more elaborate possibility, hence more developing effort is needed, but there is much larger reserve for future exploration in this kind of locality than in all the remaining ones.

== Spatial and temporal locality usage ==

=== Hierarchical memory ===
Hierarchical memory is a hardware optimization that takes the benefits of spatial and temporal locality and can be used on several levels of the memory hierarchy. [[Paging]] obviously benefits from temporal and spatial locality. A cache is a simple example of exploiting temporal locality, because it is a specially designed, faster but smaller memory area, generally used to keep recently referenced data and data near recently referenced data, which can lead to potential performance increases.

Data elements in a cache do not necessarily correspond to data elements that are spatially close in the main memory; however, data elements are brought into cache one [[cache line]] at a time. This means that spatial locality is again important: if one element is referenced, a few neighboring elements will also be brought into cache. Finally, temporal locality plays a role on the lowest level, since results that are referenced very closely together can be kept in the [[Processor register|machine registers]]. Some programming languages (such as [[C (programming language)|C]]) allow the programmer to suggest that certain variables be kept in registers.

Data locality is a typical memory reference feature of regular programs (though many irregular memory access patterns exist). It makes the hierarchical memory layout profitable. In computers, memory is divided into a hierarchy in order to speed up data accesses. The lower levels of the memory hierarchy tend to be slower, but larger. Thus, a program will achieve greater performance if it uses memory while it is cached in the upper levels of the memory hierarchy and avoids bringing other data into the upper levels of the hierarchy that will displace data that will be used shortly in the future. This is an ideal, and sometimes cannot be achieved.

Typical memory hierarchy (access times and cache sizes are approximations of typical values used for the purpose of discussion; actual values and actual numbers of levels in the hierarchy vary):
* [[CPU register]]s (8–256 registers) – immediate access, with the speed of the innermost core of the processor
* L1 [[CPU cache]]s (32 KB to 512 [[kilobyte|KB]]) – fast access, with the speed of the innermost memory bus owned exclusively by each core
* L2 CPU caches (128 KB to 24 [[megabyte|MB]]) – slightly slower access, with the speed of the [[memory bus]] shared between twins of cores
* L3 CPU caches (2 MB up to a max of 64 [[megabyte|MB]]) – even slower access, with the speed of the memory bus shared between even more cores of the same processor
* Main [[physical memory]] ([[random-access memory|RAM]]) (256 MB to 64 [[gigabyte|GB]]) – slow access, the speed of which is limited by the spatial distances and general hardware interfaces between the processor and the memory modules on the [[motherboard]]
* Disk ([[virtual memory]], [[file system]]) (1 GB to 256 [[terabyte|TB]]) – very slow, due to the narrower (in bit width), physically much longer data channel between the main board of the computer and the disk devices, and due to the extraneous software protocol needed on the top of the slow hardware interface
* Remote memory (other computers or the cloud) (practically unlimited) – speed varies from very slow to extremely slow

Modern machines tend to read blocks of lower memory into the next level of the memory hierarchy. If this displaces used memory, the [[operating system]] tries to predict which data will be accessed least (or latest) and move it down the memory hierarchy. Prediction algorithms tend to be simple to reduce hardware complexity, though they are becoming somewhat more complicated.

=== Matrix multiplication ===
A common example is [[Matrix multiplication algorithm|matrix multiplication]]:
for i in 0..n
 for j in 0..m
 for k in 0..p
 C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j];
By switching the looping order for codice_1 and codice_2, the speedup in large matrix multiplications becomes dramatic, at least for languages that put contiguous array elements in the last dimension. This will not change the mathematical result, but it improves efficiency. In this case, &quot;large&quot; means, approximately, more than 100,000 elements in each matrix, or enough addressable memory such that the matrices will not fit in L1 and L2 caches.
for i in 0..n
 for k in 0..p
 for j in 0..m
 C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j];
The reason for this speedup is that in the first case, the reads of codice_3 are in cache (since the codice_2 index is the contiguous, last dimension), but codice_5 is not, so there is a cache miss penalty on codice_5. codice_7 is irrelevant, because it can be [[Loop-invariant_code_motion|hoisted]] out of the inner loop -- the loop variable there is codice_2.
for i in 0..n
 for j in 0..m
 temp = C[i][j]
 for k in 0..p
 temp = temp + A[i][k] * B[k][j];
 C[i][j] = temp
In the second case, the reads and writes of codice_7 are both in cache, the reads of codice_5 are in cache, and the read of codice_3 can be hoisted out of the inner loop.
for i in 0..n
 for k in 0..p
 temp = A[i][k]
 for j in 0..m
 C[i][j] = C[i][j] + temp * B[k][j];
Thus, the second example has no cache miss penalty in the inner loop while the first example has a cache penalty.

On a year 2014 processor, the second case is approximately five times faster than the first case, when written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and compiled with codice_12. (A careful examination of the disassembled code shows that in the first case, [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] uses [[SIMD]] instructions and in the second case it does not, but the cache penalty is much worse than the SIMD gain.)

Temporal locality can also be improved in the above example by using a technique called [[Loop blocking|blocking]]. The larger matrix can be divided into evenly sized sub-matrices, so that the smaller blocks can be referenced (multiplied) several times while in memory. Note that this example works for square matrices of dimensions SIZE x SIZE, but it can easily be extended for arbitrary matrices by substituting SIZE_I, SIZE_J and SIZE_K where appropriate.
for (ii = 0; ii &lt; SIZE; ii += BLOCK_SIZE)
 for (kk = 0; kk &lt; SIZE; kk += BLOCK_SIZE)
 for (jj = 0; jj &lt; SIZE; jj += BLOCK_SIZE)
 maxi = min(ii + BLOCK_SIZE, SIZE);
 for (i = ii; i &lt; maxi; i++)
 maxk = min(kk + BLOCK_SIZE, SIZE);
 for (k = kk; k &lt; maxk; k++)
 maxj = min(jj + BLOCK_SIZE, SIZE);
 for (j = jj; j &lt; maxj; j++)
 C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j];
The temporal locality of the above solution is provided because a block can be used several times before moving on, so that it is moved in and out of memory less often. Spatial locality is improved because elements with consecutive memory addresses tend to be pulled up the memory hierarchy together.

<text>The Green Mile is a 1996 serial novel by American writer Stephen King. It tells the story of death row supervisor Paul Edgecombe&#x27;s encounter with John Coffey, an unusual inmate who displays inexplicable healing and empathetic abilities. The serial novel was originally released in six volumes before being republished as a single-volume work. The book is an example of magical realism. The subsequent film adaptation was a critical and commercial success. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel in 1996. In 1997, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; was nominated as Best Novel for the British Fantasy Award and the Locus Award. In 2003 the book was listed on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;best-loved novel&quot;.

==Plot==
Featuring a first-person narrative told by Paul Edgecombe, the novel switches between Paul as an old man in the Georgia Pines nursing home writing down his story in 1996, and his time in 1932 as the block supervisor of the Cold Mountain Penitentiary death row, nicknamed &quot;The Green Mile&quot; for the color of the floor&#x27;s linoleum. This year marks the arrival of John Coffey, a 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) tall powerfully built black man who has been convicted of raping and murdering two young white girls. During his time on the Mile, John interacts with fellow prisoners Eduard &quot;Del&quot; Delacroix, a Cajun arsonist, rapist, and murderer; and William Wharton (&quot;Billy the Kid&quot; to himself, &quot;Wild Bill&quot; to the guards), an unhinged and dangerous multiple murderer who is determined to make as much trouble as he can before he is executed. Other inhabitants include Arlen Bitterbuck, a Native American convicted of killing a man in a fight over a pair of boots, Arthur Flanders, a real estate executive who killed his father to perpetrate insurance fraud; and Mr Jingles, a mouse Del teaches various tricks.

Paul and the other guards are irritated throughout the book by Percy Wetmore, a sadistic guard who enjoys antagonizing the prisoners. The other guards have to be civil to him despite their dislike of him because he is the nephew of the Governor&#x27;s wife. When Percy is offered an administrative position at the nearby Briar Ridge psychiatric hospital, Paul thinks they are finally rid of him. However, Percy refuses to leave until he is allowed to supervise an execution, so Paul hesitantly allows him to run Del&#x27;s. Percy deliberately avoids soaking a sponge in brine that is supposed to be tucked inside the electrode cap to ensure a quick death in the electric chair. When the switch is thrown, the current causes Del to catch fire in the chair and suffer a prolonged, agonizing demise.

Over time, Paul realizes that John Coffey possesses inexplicable healing abilities, which he uses to cure Paul&#x27;s urinary tract infection and revive Mr Jingles after Percy stomps on him. Simple-minded and shy, John is very empathic and sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of others around him. One night, the guards drug Wharton, then put a straitjacket on Percy and lock him in the padded restraint room so that they can smuggle John out of prison and take him to the home of Warden Hal Moores. Hal&#x27;s wife Melinda has an inoperable brain tumor, which John cures. When they return to the Mile, John passes the &quot;disease&quot; from Melinda into Percy, causing him to go mad and shoot Wharton to death before falling into a catatonic state from which he never recovers. Percy is then committed to Briar Ridge as a patient.

Paul&#x27;s long-simmering suspicions that John is innocent are proven right when he discovers that it was actually Wharton who raped and killed the two girls and that John was trying to revive them. Later, John tells Paul what he saw, when Wharton grabbed his arm one time, how Wharton had coerced the sisters to be silent by threatening to kill one if the other made a noise, using their love for each other. Paul is unsure how to help John, but John tells him not to worry, as he is ready to die anyway, wanting to escape the cruelty of the world. John&#x27;s execution is the last one in which Paul participates.

As Paul approaches the conclusion of his written story, he offers it to his friend Elaine Connelly to read. After she finishes doing so, he introduces Mr Jingles to her just before the mouse dies – it had been alive the past 64 years. Paul explains that those healed by John gained an unnaturally long lifespan. Elaine dies shortly after, never learning the fact that on one fateful day of 1956 when Paul witnessed his wife&#x27;s death from a traffic accident while on the way to their granddaughter&#x27;s graduation, Paul saw the ghost of John Coffey looking at him from an overpass. The novel ends with Paul all alone, now 104 years old, wondering how much longer he will live.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
;Paul Edgecombe
:The protagonist and narrator of the book and the death row supervisor at Cold Mountain Penitentiary. He is 40 years old when the bulk of the story takes place, in 1932. He is a caring man and takes excellent care of the men on his block, avoiding conflict and keeping the peace whenever possible. He is the first character to discover John Coffey&#x27;s amazing abilities, when the prisoner cures his urinary tract infection. It is also his idea to take Coffey to try to cure Melinda, Warden Hal Moores&#x27; wife, of her brain tumor. He transferred to Boy&#x27;s Correctional with Brutus Howell shortly after Coffey&#x27;s execution, and he is still alive at age 104 as of 1996, when he decides to pen down John Coffey&#x27;s story, possibly to publicly reveal the latter&#x27;s innocence.
;Brutus &quot;Brutal&quot; Howell
:He is second in command on the Green Mile and Paul&#x27;s best friend. He is a tall, imposing man but not violent at all unless necessary. His nickname of &quot;Brutal&quot; is intended as irony, as he is normally calm and soft-spoken. A former football tackle who had gone on to play at Louisiana State University (LSU) in his youth, he eventually suffers a fatal heart attack at home, presumably in his late fifties, about twenty-five years after Coffey&#x27;s execution.
;John Coffey
:He is an African American with a massive build (6 ft 8 in tall), having been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls and sentenced to death. He is very quiet and prefers to keep to himself, weeps almost constantly, and is afraid of the dark. Even at the end, during his execution, he asks Paul Edgecombe not to put on the traditional black silk mask used to block the view of the prisoner&#x27;s face because he fears the dark. Coffey is described as &quot;knowing his own name and not much else&quot; and lacks the capability to do so much as tie a simple knot. At his trial, though, the prosecution contends that he lured the girls away from their home, disposed of the watchdog, and carefully planned the crime using abilities that Paul believes to be far beyond his reach. He is the calmest and mildest prisoner the guards have ever seen, despite his hulking form. He turns out to be innocent of the rape and murder of the two girls, but allows himself to be executed regardless because he is tired of all the cruelty in the world.
;Percy Wetmore
:The secondary antagonist of the story. He is a young and sadistic guard. He is disliked by Paul and the other guards because of his ways, but they cannot do anything about it because he is the nephew of the state governor&#x27;s wife. He is very homophobic and attacks Eduard Delacroix for allegedly touching him, although it was an accident caused by Del stumbling out of the prison truck. He is later attacked by &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton, consequently wets himself, and is teased by Delacroix for it. In retaliation, Percy deliberately sabotages Delacroix&#x27;s execution. At the end of the story he is sent to the Briar Ridge mental institution, originally considered for a job but now as a patient, after Coffey transferred Melinda&#x27;s disease to him that caused him to kill William Wharton and lose his sanity. Percy, who never recovered his sanity, eventually lives through a hospital fire and dies at another mental hospital in 1965.
;William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton
:The main antagonist of the story. He is on death row for various crimes, including an armed robbery in which he killed a pregnant woman and two other innocent bystanders. He does not like the nickname &quot;Wild Bill&quot; but prefers to be called &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;, a name that he has tattooed on his forearm. When he first arrives he manages to convince the guards that he is in a drugged stupor, only to attack and attempt to strangle to death Dean Stanton when they reach E Block. He continues to wreak havoc on the Mile and plays tricks such as urinating on the guards and spitting a chewed-up Moon Pie into Brutal&#x27;s face. He is punished by being placed in solitary confinement countless times, but never learnt his lesson. As John Coffey is being smuggled to Hal Moores&#x27;s house, Wild Bill grabs his arm and Coffey sees that he actually committed the crimes for which Coffey was convicted. Therefore, Coffey gives Percy the &quot;sickness&quot; he took from the warden&#x27;s wife, thus killing Wild Bill.
;Eduard &quot;Del&quot; Delacroix
:He is a Cajun prisoner with a fairly slow grasp of the English language, and has no family. He raped and murdered a young girl before starting a fire, which caused the deaths of six more people (including two children), resulting in his being sent to death row after a lengthy trial. While on the Mile, Del befriends a mouse named Mr Jingles, who becomes his best friend in his last days on death row. Percy, his enemy, sabotages his execution, causing Del to die a slow and gruesome death in the electric chair.
;Mr Jingles / Steamboat Willie
:Called Steamboat Willie by Brutal, he&#x27;s an unusually intelligent mouse who enjoys eating peppermint sweets. He becomes a friend to Eduard Delacroix, who renames him Mr Jingles, in the few days before the man is executed. He is healed by John Coffey after being stomped on by Percy Wetmore. This gives him increased longevity and he finally dies 64 years later.

===Minor characters===
;Arthur &quot;The President&quot; Flanders
:An inmate on death row, convicted of killing his father in an insurance fraud scheme. His sentence is commuted to life imprisonment, but he is later murdered by an unknown inmate in the prison laundry in 1944, 12 years after Coffey was put to death.
;Arlen &quot;The Chief&quot; Bitterbuck
:A Washita Cherokee death row inmate, convicted of killing a man in a drunken brawl over a pair of boots. His execution is the first of three mentioned in Paul&#x27;s story.
;Janice Edgecombe
:Paul Edgecombe&#x27;s wife. Dies at the age of 59 in a bus accident on the way to her grandchild&#x27;s graduation in 1956.
;Hal Moores
:The warden at Cold Mountain Penitentiary. After Coffey cured his wife, he somehow suspected the truth of Coffey&#x27;s supposed guilt of the double murder he was convicted of. Hal died from a stroke around the same time as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
;Melinda Moores
:Warden Moores&#x27;s wife, who is dying of a brain tumor and is cured by John Coffey. She dies of a heart attack ten years later.
;Curtis Anderson
:The assistant warden.
;Dean Stanton
:A guard on E Block who is strangled and nearly killed by William Wharton. A father of young children, Paul ensures he takes no part in the taking of John Coffey to Melinda Moores due to the risk of losing his job. He applies for relocation to C Block after John Coffey&#x27;s death, where he is murdered by an inmate four months later.
;Harry Terwilliger
:One of the main guards on E Block along with his friends Paul Edgecombe, Brutus Howell and Dean Stanton. He eventually dies of cancer in 1982, 50 years after John Coffey&#x27;s execution.
;Bill Dodge
:A &quot;floater&quot; guard on E Block (not permanently assigned there).
;Jack Van Hay
:A guard who is part of the execution team. He operates the switch room.
;Toot-Toot
:A trustee who stands in for the condemned during execution rehearsals and sells snacks to prisoners and guards.
;Burt Hammersmith
:A reporter who wrote on the Detterick twins&#x27; murders and John Coffey&#x27;s trial. Despite believing himself to be an &quot;Enlightenment&quot; man, he displays prejudice in his stance on &quot;Negroes&quot; and tries to convince Paul of John Coffey&#x27;s guilt.
;Elaine Connelly
:A friend of Paul in the present-day nursing home where he tells his story. She is later revealed to be the grandmother of the Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives and uses her influence to prevent Brad Dolan from harassing Paul. She dies from a heart attack three months after hearing Paul&#x27;s story about John Coffey.
;Homer Cribus
:The Sheriff of Trapingus County, where the murders of the Detterick twins took place. Despite playing no part in apprehending John Coffey, he later shows up at the execution. An outspoken Baptist with strong racial prejudice and immensely overweight, he later succumbs to a heart attack while having sex with a 17-year-old African American in his office.
;Rob McGee
:The Deputy Sheriff of Trapingus County, who led the search party that found John Coffey. While displaying strong doubt about Coffey&#x27;s guilt after being shown signs of innocence by Paul Edgecombe, he is still powerless to call for an appeal as he is subordinate to Sheriff Cribus, whom he allegedly hopes to succeed.
;Brad Dolan
:A malicious nursing home employee who harasses Paul Edgecombe. Paul strongly compares him to Percy Wetmore, and several times mistakes him for Percy, despite the latter having died in 1965.
;Kathe and Cora Detterick
:The two young girls whom John Coffey was convicted of raping and murdering, though the crime was actually done by William Wharton.
;Klaus and Marjorie Detterick
:The parents of Kathe and Cora. Marjorie was killed in a car accident 18 years after John Coffey&#x27;s execution while Klaus died from a stroke in March 1933 shortly after John Coffey&#x27;s execution.
;Howie Detterick
:Klaus and Marjorie&#x27;s son and Kathe and Cora&#x27;s brother who goes with his dad to find the twins after they were taken.

==Film adaptation==
Frank Darabont adapted the novel into a screenplay for a feature film of the same name. Released in 1999, the film was directed by Darabont and stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecombe and Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. The setting is changed from 1932 to 1935 in order to include the film &quot;Top Hat&quot;, which does not appear in the book. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Duncan.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Green Mile&quot; was first published in six paperback volumes. The first, subtitled &quot;The Two Dead Girls&quot; was published on March 28, 1996, with new volumes following monthly until the final volume, &quot;Coffey on the Mile&quot;, was released on August 29, 1996. The novel was republished as a single paperback volume on May 5, 1997. On October 3, 2000, the book was published in its first hardcover edition (). In 2007, Subterranean Press released a 10th anniversary edition of the novel in three different versions, each mimicking the original six-volume release: the Gift Edition, limited to 2,000 copies, containing six unsigned hardcover volumes of each separate part, housed in a slipcase; the Limited Edition, limited to 148 numbered copies, and signed by Stephen King, housed in a slipcase; and the Lettered Edition, limited to 52 lettered copies, and signed by Stephen King, housed in a traycase. Every edition contained new illustrations by Mark Geyer, the novel&#x27;s original illustrator. Each version had its own design, and cost $150, $900, and $2,500, respectively.
There were other versions published as well, including a &quot;pocketbook&quot; sized hardcover by Paw Prints ().

King was first made aware of the possibility to publish stories in shorter instalments by Ralph Vicinanza, who, after a conversation with British publisher Malcolm Edwards, learned that Charles Dickens had often published his stories in shorter instalments by either folding them into magazines, or by publishing the instalments on their own as a chapbook. After a lengthy struggle to write the novel, Vicinaza pitched the idea of writing the book &quot;the same way it would be read - in installments&quot; to King the year before the initial release of the first instalment. The idea of serialized publication appealed to King on multiple levels; from the writer&#x27;s responsibility to finish the story once the first installment is published, to the readers&#x27; inability to skip to the end of the story and ruin the suspense. In the introduction to the first collected edition of the story, King also explains the financial aspect of initially publishing the book in six installments :

<text>Four Past Midnight is a collection of novellas written by Stephen King in 1988 and 1989 and published in August 1990. It is his second book of this type, the first one being &quot;Different Seasons&quot;. The collection won the Bram Stoker Award in 1990 for Best Collection and was nominated for a Locus Award in 1991. In the introduction, King says that, while a collection of four novellas like &quot;Different Seasons&quot;, this book is more strictly horror with elements of the supernatural.

==Novellas==

===&quot;The Langoliers&quot;===

==== Plot ====

Pilot Brian Engle, immediately after a difficult flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles, learns that his ex-wife Anne has died in an accident and boards a red-eye flight to Boston as a passenger. A flight attendant speaks of an unusual phenomenon over the Mojave Desert that resembles an aurora. Brian falls asleep during takeoff, having been awake throughout his previous flight. Dinah Bellman, a young blind girl with psychic abilities, also falls asleep, and awakes to find that her aunt and several other passengers have disappeared. 

Dinah, mistaking a wig for a scalp, screams and awakes Brian and nine other passengers: teacher Laurel Stevenson, English diplomat Nick Hopewell, writer Bob Jenkins, violinist Albert Kaussner, recovering addict Bethany Simms, businessman Rudy Warwick, mechanic Don Gaffney, mentally ill bank manager Craig Toomy and an unknown heavily intoxicated passenger. The passengers find that the crew and the passengers who were awake have disappeared, leaving the airliner under the control of the autopilot. Brian takes control of the plane but is unable to make any outside contact, and the passengers can only see a dark void below. Brian manages to land in Bangor, Maine, despite furious protests from Toomy, who insists on reaching Boston for an important board meeting.

Upon arrival, the group finds the airport deserted. The clocks have stopped, there is no electricity and the environment seems generally lifeless. As all products and substances have lost their quality, fuel does not burn, thus preventing further flight. Dinah hears an approaching and threatening sound, and the group agrees to leave before it arrives. The unhinged Toomy considers the situation to be a conspiracy against him and takes Bethany hostage at gunpoint, but the environment has robbed the gun of its potency, and the passengers subdue Toomy. 

Bob concludes that the aforementioned phenomenon was a &quot;time rip&quot; that has sent their plane into the past. As Dinah reports that the sound is growing closer, Toomy relates to Dinah and Laurel that the sound is emitted by the &quot;Langoliers&quot;, which were said by his abusive father to hunt and devour negligent and unmotivated boys. Albert theorizes that time is still flowing inside the plane, which is proven when food brought on board is restored to its normal properties. With the realization that fuel pumped into the airliner will also return to normal, Brian has the plane refueled and manages to start the engines. Meanwhile, Toomy frees himself from his bonds and stabs Dinah, perceiving her to be a Langolier. Despite this, Dinah insists that Toomy must not be killed because the group needs him alive. As Albert and Don search for a stretcher for Dinah, Toomy kills Don before Albert subdues him. Dinah, while being transported onto the plane, telepathically leads Toomy to the runway, where he hallucinates his board meeting. The Langoliers appear in the form of toothed spherical creatures, and they are distracted from the departing plane as they devour Toomy and the surrounding reality.

Bob proposes that the Langoliers&#x27; purpose is to clean up what is left of the past by devouring it. Dinah succumbs to her injuries, and the plane approaches the time rip. Bob realizes that the passengers must be asleep when passing through the rip, otherwise they will disappear. Albert suggests lowering the cabin pressure to induce unconsciousness, which would require one passenger to sacrifice themself by remaining conscious to restore the pressure just before the plane passes through the rip. Nick volunteers, wishing to atone for mistakenly shooting and killing three Irish children, and asks Laurel to go to his father to ask forgiveness. Nick, wearing an emergency oxygen mask, flies the plane through the rip and disappears. Brian awakes and lands the plane at Los Angeles, but the passengers are again met with a deserted airport. Realizing that they are in the near future, the passengers take shelter against a wall to avoid the airport&#x27;s human traffic and wait for the present to catch up to them. A wave of rising noise and motion hits them and they find themselves in the present again.

==== Television film adaptation ====
&quot;The Langoliers&quot; was adapted for a two-part TV movie in 1994. The TV movie stars Kate Maberly, Kimber Riddle, Patricia Wettig, Mark Lindsay Chapman, Frankie Faison, Baxter Harris, Dean Stockwell, David Morse, Christopher Collet, and Bronson Pinchot.

The movie version of &quot;The Langoliers&quot;, produced for broadcast on ABC-TV, was filmed almost exclusively in and around the Bangor International Airport in Bangor, Maine (where author Stephen King attended college) during the summer of 1994. King himself, echoing Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s famous numerous cameos, made a cameo appearance in the film as Craig Toomy&#x27;s boss during Toomy&#x27;s hallucination.

===&quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot;===

&quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot; is similar to King&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;The Dark Half&quot;. Both are about authors who are thinly veiled analogues of King himself—Thad Beaumont in &quot;The Dark Half&quot; and Mort Rainey in &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot;.

====Plot====
Morton Rainey, a successful novelist in Maine, is confronted by a man from Mississippi named John Shooter, who claims Mort plagiarized a story he wrote. Mort vehemently denies ever plagiarizing anything. Shooter leaves, but not before leaving his manuscript, &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot;. Mort throws the manuscript into the trash can. When his housemaid recovers the manuscript—thinking it belongs to Mort—he finally reads Shooter&#x27;s story, discovering that it is almost identical to his short story &quot;Sowing Season&quot;. The only differences are the title, the character&#x27;s name, the diction, and the ending. Mort is disturbed by these findings.

Shooter returns a few days later. Having learned that &quot;Sowing Season&quot; was published two years before Shooter claimed to have written &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot;, Mort confronts him with this information. An enraged Shooter accuses Mort of lying and demands proof, giving Mort three days to show him his published story. Overnight, he kills Mort&#x27;s cat and burns down the house of his ex-wife, which contained the magazine issue in which &quot;Sowing Season&quot; was published. Mort orders a new copy of the magazine. He also asks his caretaker, Greg Carstairs, to tail Shooter and to talk to a man named Tom Greenleaf, who drove past Mort and Shooter. Shooter, angry that Mort has involved other people in their business, kills both men and plants evidence framing Mort for the murders. Upon receiving the magazine and returning home, Mort finds that &quot;Sowing Season&quot; has been removed.

Mort realizes that Shooter is really his own split personality. He had created &quot;Shooter&quot; out of guilt for stealing the story &quot;Crowfoot Mile&quot; early in his career and had recently been suspected of another act of plagiarism, although he was innocent the second time. Tom had not seen Shooter while driving by—he saw Mort, by himself. Mort realizes he burned down his own home, killed his own cat, and murdered two people. He blacks out. Fifteen minutes later he awakens, only to hear who he believes to be Shooter pulling into his driveway. Desperate for any sign of his own sanity, he rushes outside only to find his ex-wife, Amy. Devastated, he loses control of his body and mind to Shooter. Amy discovers that Mort has gone insane, having written the word &quot;Shooter&quot; all over his house. She goes to Mort&#x27;s study, where &quot;Shooter&quot; attempts to kill her in an ambush. She manages to escape. &quot;Shooter&quot;, chasing Amy outside, is shot by her insurance agent. Mort becomes himself again, addresses Amy, and dies.

Later, Amy and Ted Milner—a man she had an affair with before divorcing Mort—discuss her ex-husband&#x27;s motives. She insists that Mort had become two people, one of them a character so vivid it became real. She then recalls something Tom witnessed—when he drove past Mort alone, he saw Shooter and Mort in his rearview mirror, but Shooter was transparent. Amy then reveals that while digging through Mort&#x27;s house, she found Shooter&#x27;s trademark hat. She left it right-side up on a trash bag. When she returned, she found a note from Shooter inside the overturned hat, revealing that he has traveled back to Mississippi with the story he came for, &quot;Crowfoot Mile&quot;. Amy remarks that Mort had created a character so vivid, he actually came to life.

====Adaptations====
A 2004 film adaptation called &quot;Secret Window&quot; was made, starring Johnny Depp, John Turturro, Maria Bello and Timothy Hutton. The storyline of the movie differs from that of the novel, most notably in their respective endings. In the movie, Mort kills his wife and her lover, while in the novel he is killed before he has a chance to do so. In the movie, after months it is shown that Mort grew corn in his wife&#x27;s garden, where it is implied that he buried her and her lover, thus removing any proof that he murdered them. Another difference is the titles of the short stories: in the movie, Mort Rainey wrote a story called &quot;Secret Window&quot; and John Shooter wrote &quot;Sowing Season&quot;. The story in the movie version is set in upstate New York instead of Maine.

A three-episode radio adaptation was first broadcast in 1999 on BBC Radio 4 starring Henry Goodman, William Roberts, Barbara Barnes, Lee Montague and Kerry Shale.

====Inspiration====
King has been the subject of unfounded accusations of plagiarism. A woman claimed that King stole several of her story ideas and based characters from his books on her. All of her cases have been dismissed. In another incident, a deranged man broke into King&#x27;s home, and when discovered by King&#x27;s wife, claimed that King stole the plot of &quot;Misery&quot; from the intruder&#x27;s aunt and that he had a bomb in the shoebox he was holding and was going to blow up the house. The fake bomb was made of pencils with paperclips wrapped around the erasers.

===&quot;The Library Policeman&quot;===
&quot;The Library Policeman&quot; tells of Sam Peebles and his battle against an age-old fear.

Peebles is asked to give a speech to his local Rotary Club. An office assistant named Naomi Higgins directs him to the public library to check out books that might help with his speechwriting. At the library, he receives a library card and assistance in finding books from an elderly librarian, Ardelia Lortz. Having noticed a series of disturbing posters in the children&#x27;s section, including one featuring a frightening &quot;Library Policeman&quot; character, he discusses their appropriateness with Ardelia. After being rebuffed by her, Sam checks out the books with the warning that they must be returned on time or else &quot;I&#x27;ll have to send the Library Policeman after you.&quot;

The speech is a success, but Naomi informs Sam that Ardelia Lortz has been dead for many years. Ardelia, as a young woman, committed suicide in 1960 after murdering two children and a local deputy sheriff. The books are accidentally destroyed and a menacing Library Policeman terrorizes Sam at his house. Through Naomi, Sam meets Dave &quot;Dirty Dave&quot; Duncan, an alcoholic former sign painter and a former lover of Ardelia&#x27;s. From Dave&#x27;s recollections, Sam discovers that Ardelia is not a person but a being which feeds on fear and that Duncan was a sometimes unwilling companion/conspirator in helping her feed from the fear of children. Dave believes Ardelia is seeking revenge and a new host. While the trio attempt to stop Ardelia&#x27;s return, Sam recalls a repressed memory: a man claiming to be a &quot;Library Policeman&quot; raped and threatened Sam when he was a young child in St. Louis. However, the new Library Policeman is not just a recreation of the man from Sam&#x27;s past, but also an embodiment of Ardelia, who wants Sam as her new host.

Dave dies defending Sam and Naomi from Ardelia. Sam and Naomi defeat the Library Policeman/Ardelia, only to discover that Ardelia has already attached to Naomi in the form of a blistery growth. Sam removes the creature from Naomi&#x27;s neck and destroys it under the wheels of a passing train.

===&quot;The Sun Dog&quot;===

When Kevin Delevan receives a Sun 660 Polaroid camera for his fifteenth birthday, he discovers a strange defect: the only photos it produces are of a malicious black dog which seems to move closer with each shot as though to attack the photographer. On a recommendation, Kevin seeks help from Reginald &quot;Pop&quot; Merrill, the wealthy and unscrupulous owner of a junk shop in the town of Castle Rock, Maine. While just as unsettled by the phenomenon as Kevin, Merrill sees an opportunity to further his own interests; namely, selling the camera to a paranormal enthusiast for a great deal of money. He manages to switch out the camera for another of the same model, which Kevin destroys. Much to his dismay, however, Merrill cannot rid himself of the Sun as his customers either dismiss it as a hoax or decline to purchase it due to the discomfort and unease they feel upon viewing the photos. Furthermore, he finds himself increasingly compelled to use the Sunthe dog slowly advancing and transforming into something more savage and monstrous with every picture he takes.

In the meantime, Kevin is plagued by recurring nightmares about the dog. Realizing that Merrill tricked him and the Sun was never destroyed, he sets out to prevent Merrill from taking any more photos for fear that the dog will &quot;break through&quot; into the real world. By this point, the camera&#x27;s influence over Merrill has caused him to lose his grip on sanity. After waking up one night to find himself holding the Sun and repeatedly pressing its trigger, he resolves to smash it in the morning. However, he hallucinates that one of the cuckoo clocks hanging on the wall of his store is really the camera and smashes that instead. Under the illusion that he is repairing a clock at his workbench, Merrill starts taking pictures again. At this moment, Kevin and his father arrive to confront Merrill, but are too late to stop him. The dog tears its way out of the final photograph, killing Merrill in the process. Inspired by his nightmares, Kevin has brought another Sun with him, and just as the dog is about to release itself, he takes its picture, trapping it once more in the &quot;Polaroid world&quot;.

In the epilogue, Kevin gets a computer for his following birthday. In order to test its word processor function, he types &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot; Rather than a printout of this text, the page reads, &quot;The dog is loose again. It is not sleeping. It is not lazy. It&#x27;s coming for you, Kevin. It&#x27;s very hungry. And it&#x27;s &quot;VERY&quot; angry.&quot;

==Reception==
Upon its release, Michael A. Morrison in &quot;Washington Post&quot; called the collection &quot;exceptionally well crafted&quot; with the exception of &quot;Sun Dog&quot;, praising King&#x27;s &quot;unexpected similes&quot; and his use of &quot;dreams to reveal character&quot;. Robert Chatain called it possibly King&#x27;s best book and &quot;a serious, heavyweight effort&quot;, characterising the tales as &quot;rich&quot; as well as &quot;fast, tricky, even perverse, like carnival rides that look easy from the ground but turn unexpectedly nasty and vertiginous when we&#x27;re up in the air&quot;.

However, Josh Rubins in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the anthology a &quot;C+&quot; and considered it formulaic with &quot;enthusiasm&quot; and contemporary setting. Rubins compared a novella &quot;The Langoliers&quot; to—quoting characters of the novella—a &quot;stupid disaster [movie]&quot; and a &quot;bad [television] movie.&quot; He found &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot; bearably suspenseful with a &quot;gimmicky, least convincing [finale].&quot; He called &quot;The Sun Dog&quot; the &quot;simplest, most distinctive story&quot; and praised it as mostly &quot;a delicious black comedy.&quot; Andy Solomon in &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that King&#x27;s mass appeal comes &quot;ironically from his cliched diction,&quot; referring to the anthology&#x27;s reliance on popular culture for descriptions.

<doc id="64035" wikidata="Q384160" url="?curid=64035" title="The Long Walk (novel)">
<text>The Long Walk is a dystopian horror novel by American writer Stephen King, published in 1979, under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. It was collected in 1985 in the hardcover omnibus &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;, and has seen several reprints since, as both paperback and hardcover. In 2023, Centipede Press released the first stand-alone hardcover edition.

Set in a future dystopian United States, ruled by a totalitarian regime, the plot revolves around the contestants of a grueling annual walking contest. In 2000, the American Library Association listed &quot;The Long Walk&quot; as one of the 100 best books for teenage readers published between 1966 and 2000.

While not the first of King&#x27;s novels to be published, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; was the first novel he wrote, having begun it in 1966–67 during his freshman year at the University of Maine, some eight years before his first published novel, &quot;Carrie&quot;, was released in 1974.

==Plot==
In a dystopian United States, a major source of entertainment is the Long Walk, an annual contest in which 100 teenage boys walk without rest along U.S. Route 1. Each Walker must stay above . If a Walker drops below this speed for 30 seconds for any reason, including if he is injured or unconscious, he gets a warning. A Walker can lose a warning if he walks for an hour without earning another one. If a Walker gets three warnings and fails to resume pace after 30 seconds, he is shot dead by soldiers. The last surviving Walker earns a large sum of money and a &quot;Prize&quot; consisting of whatever he wants for the rest of his life.

Ray Garraty, from Androscoggin County, Maine, arrives at the start of the Walk on the Canada-Maine border, where he meets several other Walkers such as the sardonic McVries, the friendly Baker, the cocky Olson and the enigmatic Stebbins. The Major, the leader of the secret police force known as the Squads, starts the Walk. Throughout the first day, Garraty befriends Baker, Olson, and several other Walkers such as Abraham and Pearson, growing particularly close to McVries and becoming particularly intrigued by Stebbins. A Walker named Barkovitch reveals to a reporter that he is in the Long Walk to &quot;dance on the graves&quot; of other participants, and later provokes another Walker into attacking him, resulting in the Walker&#x27;s death and Barkovitch being ostracized.

Garraty succeeds in surviving the night. Scramm, the odds-on favorite in Vegas, tells Garraty that he has a pregnant wife and so will have sufficient motivation to keep going. Garraty decides that his motivation will be surviving until Freeport as this will allow him to see his girlfriend Jan in the crowd. The Walkers begin to resent the Major, and McVries stops walking in an attempt to fight the soldiers, but is saved by Garraty. In return, McVries saves Garraty&#x27;s life after Garraty experiences hysterics when the spectators increase in number. This camaraderie infuriates Olson, who is now severely fatigued and wants Garraty to die. Garraty reveals to the others that his father was Squaded, and a fight almost breaks out between McVries and another Walker, Collie Parker, when Parker claims that only &quot;damn fools&quot; are Squaded.

Stebbins tells Garraty both that he believes he is going to win, and that the Walkers are all participating because they want to die. McVries and Baker both seem to be examples of this, due to McVries seeking pain and Baker&#x27;s fascination with death; McVries also tells Garraty that he will sit down when he cannot walk any further. Stebbins also advises Garraty to watch Olson, who keeps walking despite being unresponsive. After Garraty brings Olson out of this state, Olson attacks the soldiers and is killed slowly and brutally.

Scramm catches pneumonia and becomes unable to finish the Walk, and the other Walkers agree that the winner should provide financial security for Scramm&#x27;s wife. Garraty asks Barkovitch to join the agreement, and Barkovitch agrees as he has become lonely and manic in his isolation from the others. Garraty also asks Stebbins, who tells Garraty that there was nothing special about Olson and that he was lying; Garraty, however, believes that Stebbins came to a realization that scared him. Scramm thanks the others and is killed in an act of defiance against the soldiers.

After developing a charley horse, Garraty is given three warnings and has to walk for an hour to lose one. To distract himself, he tells McVries about how he felt a compulsion to join the Walk and that his mother was blinded by the thought of financial security. McVries reveals that he joined the Walk against the wishes of his family, and Abraham tells Garraty that he did not withdraw after being accepted due to the amusement it provided his town.

Garraty begins to suffer from doubts about his sexuality and masculinity due to suppressed memories re-emerging, especially after McVries hints that he is sexually attracted to Garraty. This causes Garraty to lash out at a deteriorating Barkovitch, and Barkovitch commits suicide when the rest of the Walkers begin taunting him. Garraty wakes the next morning to find that many Walkers (including Pearson) have died overnight, as Barkovitch predicted.

When the Walkers arrive in Freeport, Garraty attempts to die in Jan&#x27;s arms but is saved by McVries. As a response, Abraham convinces the Walkers to make a promise to stop helping each other, which Garraty does reluctantly. This has disastrous consequences: Parker starts a revolution against the soldiers but is killed when nobody joins in; Abraham removes his shirt and catches pneumonia overnight because nobody can offer him a replacement, resulting in his death; Baker falls over and gains a severe nosebleed, and is given three warnings as nobody can help him up.

On the morning of the fifth day, Stebbins reveals to Garraty and McVries that he is the Major&#x27;s son, and that his Prize would be acceptance into the Major&#x27;s household. However, Stebbins has become aware that the Major is using him as a &quot;rabbit&quot; to cause the Walk to last longer, which has worked, as seven Walkers make it into Massachusetts. Baker, now somewhat delirious and described as a &quot;raw-blood machine&quot;, tells Garraty that he cannot walk any further and thanks Garraty for being his friend. Garraty unsuccessfully tries to talk him out of suicide.

With Baker dead, the only remaining Walkers are Garraty, Stebbins and McVries. As Garraty tells him a fairy tale, McVries falls asleep and begins walking at the crowd, and Garraty breaks his promise and saves him; however, McVries chooses to sit down and die peacefully. A distraught Garraty is beckoned by a dark figure further ahead, and decides that he will give up because Stebbins cannot be beaten. When he tries to tell Stebbins, Stebbins clutches at him in horror and falls over dead. His corpse is shot when the Major arrives.

This leaves Garraty the uncomprehending winner. He ignores the Major and approaches the dark figure (whom he believes to be another Walker), declaring that there is &quot;still so far to walk&quot;. Garraty touches the figure and finds the strength to run.

==Characters==
; Raymond Davis &#x27;Ray&#x27; Garraty (#47)
: The novel&#x27;s main character and point-of-view character, a 16-year-old boy from Pownal, Maine (for which he is called a &quot;hick&quot;). He is described as tall and well built with a &#x27;heavy shock&#x27; of &#x27;straw-thatch&#x27; hair and a faded army fatigue jacket. Garraty is bitter, naive and thoughtful, which makes him a good confidant for the other Walkers, and felt a compulsion to join the Walk that he struggles to understand. Although he has done farmwork, he is not an experienced athlete. His hobbies include dancing, reading, knitting and constellations; conversely, he dislikes beer and cities.
; Peter &quot;Pete&quot; McVries (#61)
: Garraty&#x27;s closest companion, a 16-year-old boy from Passaic, New Jersey. He is described as &quot;awesomely fit&quot; with black hair, a knapsack and a white scar across his cheek, which he received from his ex-girlfriend. McVries is sardonic and has a masochistic streak, often goading others into pushing him away even during the pains of the Walk. He saves Garraty multiple times in the game, also giving him advice. He carries a strong hatred towards Barkovitch, stating his only desire is to outlast him.
; Stebbins (#88)
: A loner who walks at the rear of the group, a 17-year-old boy and the illegitimate son of the Major. He is described as a &quot;lean Buddha&quot; with pale blue eyes and a &quot;sickly halo&quot; of blond hair, and wears an old green sweater, a blue chambray shirt, purple pants and tennis shoes (which he later swaps for moccasins). Stebbins is calm, playful and mocking, and often talks to Garraty in riddles. He is convinced that the Walk is rigged, and is scared at the prospect of it being a straight game.
; Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Baker (#3)
: Another boy who is close with Garraty and McVries. He is a boy from a large, lower-class family in Louisiana (for which he is called a &quot;cracker&quot;). He is described as appearing &quot;young and beautiful&quot; and &quot;almost ethereal&quot;, as moving with &quot;deceptive leisure&quot;, and as wearing a red-striped shirt. Baker is sweet and sincere, but is a con artist and a former night rider, and he has a fascination with his own death.
; Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Olson (#70)
: One of Garraty&#x27;s earliest companions, a boy of unknown background. He is described as an experienced smoker wearing his foodbelt slung low &quot;like a gunslinger&quot;. Olson is cocky and arrogant and humorous (&quot;raring to rip&quot;), but quickly becomes withdrawn and unresponsive, with Garraty believing that he has become a &quot;human Flying Dutchman&quot;.
; Gary Barkovitch (#5)
: A boy from Washington, DC. He is described as small and olive-skinned with a sharp nose and hooded eyes, and he sometimes wears a vinyl yellow rainhat; Garraty considers him to look like a &quot;destructive child&#x27;s teddy bear&quot;. Barkovitch is intense and adheres to a mysterious &quot;Plan&quot;, and threatens to &quot;dance on the graves&quot; of the other Walkers, but becomes paranoid and insane when they ostracize him. He and McVries have a heated hatred towards each other throughout the walk.
; Abraham &quot;Abe&quot; (#2)
: One of Garraty&#x27;s companions, a 17-year-old boy called a &quot;rube&quot;. He is described as disjointed and shambling, with reddish hair, Oxford shoes, and a jacket tied around his waist. Abraham is droll and somber and short-tempered, particularly when jibes are made at his intelligence, and entered the Walk partially as a joke.
; Collie Parker (#71-79)
: A boy from Joliet, Illinois. He is described as a big-muscled blond with a polo shirt and an insolent look; Garraty further describes him as a &quot;leather jacket hero&quot; and a &quot;Saturday night tough guy&quot;. Parker despises Maine and uses excessive profanity, and often attempts to flirt with the spectators despite considering them to be &quot;pigs&quot;.
; Pearson (#73-81)
: One of Garraty&#x27;s companions. He is described as a tall boy with glasses and pants that are too big for him. Pearson is morose and enjoys poetry, game theory and chess, and views the Walk as a competition that can be solved logically. For luck, Pearson has 99 pennies in his pocket, and moves one to his other pocket whenever someone dies.
; Scramm (#85)
: The predicted winner of the current Long Walk, a boy from Arizona with a pregnant wife. He is described as a shaggy young man with a crew cut, few remaining teeth, and a &quot;moose-like&quot; physique. Although dim-witted, Scramm is friendly and possesses a &quot;simple dignity&quot;. He has dropped out of school and works in a bedsheet factory.

== Analysis ==
Heidi Strengell describes the book as a naturalistic novel, noting King’s representation of human nature through the characters. She called it one of King’s “most pessimistic novels”. Critic Douglas Winter similarly viewed the novels as King&#x27;s most despairing work, calling it a &quot;bleak science-fictional mirror of contemporary America&quot;. Reviewers have also categorized the novel as a metaphor for the Vietnam War. James Smythe of &quot;The Guardian&quot; connects several elements of the novel to the conflict: “the televised draft, the horror of seeing new friends die, the seeming lack of reason for it occurring in the first place”.

==Adaptations==
In 1988, George A. Romero was approached to direct the film adaptation, but it never happened. By 2007, Frank Darabont had secured the rights to the film adaptation of the novel. He said that he would &quot;get to it one day&quot;. He planned to make it low-budget, &quot;weird, existential, and very self contained&quot;. Kirby Heyborne narrated an audiobook adaptation of the novel in 2010 for Blackstone Audio. In April 2018, it was announced that New Line Cinema would develop a film adaptation of the novel. Darabont&#x27;s rights to the film had lapsed, and filmmaker James Vanderbilt stepped in to write and produce the film with Bradley Fischer and William Sherak of the Mythology Entertainment production company. On May 21, 2019, New Line announced that André Øvredal would direct the adaptation, and on November 28, 2023, Øvredal was no longer attached to direct and Francis Lawrence was announced to direct the adaptation and the rights were moved to Lionsgate after it lapsed from New Line. On June 10, 2024, Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson were announced to be in talks to star. In July, Hoffman and Jonsson were confirmed to star, along with Garrett Wareing, Tut Nyuot, Charlie Plummer, Ben Wang, Jordan Gonzalez, Joshua Odjick, and Roman Griffin Davis.

<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, Lothlórien or Lórien is the fairest realm of the Elves remaining in Middle-earth during the Third Age. It is ruled by Galadriel and Celeborn from their city of tree houses at Caras Galadhon. The wood-elves of the realm are called Galadhrim.

The realm, a broad woodland between the Misty Mountains and the River Anduin, is the Elven centre of resistance against the Dark Lord Sauron in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Galadriel had one of the Three Elf-Rings, and used it to keep Sauron from seeing into Lothlórien. The Company of the Ring spent some time in Lothlórien after passing through Moria. Galadriel prepared them for their quest with individual gifts.

Scholars have noted that Lothlórien represents variously an Earthly Paradise; an Elfland where time is different, reflecting the traditions of European folklore; and a land of light striving biblically with the darkness of evil.

== Fictional description ==

=== Names ===

Tolkien gave the forest many different names, reflecting its fictional history and the way it is perceived by the different peoples of Middle-earth.

=== History ===

Early in the First Age, some of the Eldar left the Great March to Valinor and settled in the lands east of the Misty Mountains. These elves became known as the Nandor, and later as the Silvan Elves. Galadriel made contact with an existing Nandorin realm, Lindórinand, in what became Lothlórien, and planted there the golden &quot;mallorn&quot; trees which Gil-galad had received as a gift from Tar-Aldarion.

The culture and knowledge of the Silvan elves was enriched by the arrival of Sindarin Elves from west of the Misty Mountains, and the Silvan language was gradually replaced by Sindarin. Amongst these arrivals was Amdír, who became their first lord, as well as Galadriel and Celeborn, who fled the destruction of Eregion during the War of the Elves and Sauron. In the Third Age, Amroth, the former Lord of Lothlórien, went to the south of Middle-earth with his beloved Nimrodel, but drowned in the Bay of Belfalas after she went missing in the &quot;Ered Nimrais&quot; and never returned. Control of Lothlórien passed to Galadriel and Celeborn. Galadriel&#x27;s Ring of Power preserved the land from death and decay, and warded off Sauron&#x27;s gaze.

As the War of the Ring loomed, the Company of the Ring, emerging from the dark tunnels of Moria and seeing their leader Gandalf perish, was brought through Lothlórien to Caras Galadhon, and there met the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim. The Fellowship spent roughly a month in Lothlórien, though it seemed to them only a few days. Before they left, Galadriel allowed Samwise and Frodo to look in the Mirror of Galadriel, giving them a glimpse of events in the future or at other times; she also tested the loyalty of Fellowship members, and gave each of them a gift for their quest.

After the fall of Sauron, Galadriel and Celeborn rid Dol Guldur of Sauron&#x27;s influence. Galadriel left for Valinor at the beginning of the Fourth Age, and Celeborn later followed her. The city slowly became depopulated and Lothlórien faded. By the time of the death of Queen Arwen, Celeborn and Galadriel&#x27;s granddaughter, Lothlórien itself was deserted.

=== Geography ===

Lothlórien lay in the west of Wilderland. To its west stood the Misty Mountains, with the Dwarf-realm of Moria, and on its east ran the great river Anduin. Across the Anduin lay the forest of Mirkwood and the fortress of Dol Guldur, which could be glimpsed from high points in Lothlórien. The river Silverlode or Celebrant flowed through Lothlórien and joined the Anduin; it had a tributary from the west, the river Nimrodel. The realm lay primarily to the north of the Silverlode, with a small strip of forested land to the south. The main part of the realm was the triangular region between the converging rivers Silverlode and Anduin, called the Naith (Sindarin for &quot;spearhead&quot;) by the Elves or the or Angle in the Common Speech. The tip of the Naith was called the Egladil (Sindarin for &quot;elven-point&quot;).

Caras Galadhon (from &quot;galadh&quot; (&quot;tree&quot;) was the city of Lothlórien and the main settlement of the Galadhrim in Middle-earth. Founded by Amroth in the Third Age, deep in the forest, the city&#x27;s dwellings were atop tall &quot;mallorn&quot; trees; the mallorn had been brought to that land by Galadriel. The city was &quot;some ten miles&quot; from the point where the rivers Silverlode (Sindarin: &quot;Celebrant&quot;) and Anduin met, close to the eastern border of the realm. In the trees there were many tree-platforms, which could be elaborate dwellings or simple guard-posts. Stairways of ladders were built around the main trees, and at night the city was lit by &quot;many lamps&quot; – &quot;green and gold and silver&quot;. The city&#x27;s entrance was on the southern side.

==Analysis==
===Land of light===

The Tolkien scholar Paul H. Kocher writes that Galadriel perceives Sauron with Lothlórien&#x27;s light, &quot;but cannot be pierced by it in return&quot;. The good intelligence has the &quot;imaginative sympathy&quot; to penetrate the evil intelligence, but not &quot;vice versa&quot;. The Christian author Elizabeth Danna writes that the Elf Haldir&#x27;s explanation of this [from a &quot;flet&quot; or tree-platform high above Cerin Amroth], &quot;In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed to one another, and ever they strive now in thought; but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not yet been discovered&quot; echoes a biblical description: &quot;The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.&quot; The scholar of humanities Susan Robbins notes that Tolkien, a devout Roman Catholic, associated light as the Bible does with &quot;holiness, goodness, knowledge, wisdom, grace, hope, and God&#x27;s revelation&quot;, and that Galadriel was one of the bearers of that light.

=== Earthly paradise ===

Lothlórien is a &quot;locus amoenus&quot;, an idyllic land that Tolkien describes as having &quot;no stain&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that to get there, the Fellowship first wash off the stains of ordinary life by wading the River Nimrodel. He compares this perfect place to the Earthly Paradise that the dreamer speaks of in the Middle English poem &quot;Pearl&quot;. But then, Shippey writes, the Fellowship have to cross a rope-bridge over a second river, the Silverlode, which they must not drink from, and which the evil Gollum cannot cross. What place can they have come to then, he wonders: could they be &quot;as if dead&quot;?

Shippey notes however that it might be old England, the &quot;&#x27;mountains green&#x27; of &#x27;ancient time&#x27;&quot; in William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. As evidence, Shippey explains that when they come to the deepest part of Lothlórien, the Elf Haldir welcomes them, calling the area the &quot;Naith&quot; or &quot;&quot;, both unfamiliar words for the land between two converging rivers, the Hoarwell or &quot;Mitheithel&quot;, and the Loudwater or &quot;Bruinen&quot;, and then giving a third word with a special resonance: the &quot;Angle&quot;. Shippey states that the name &quot;England&quot; comes from the Angle between the Flensburg Fjord and the River Schlei, in the north of Germany next to Denmark, the origin of the Angles among the Anglo-Saxons who founded England. He suggests that Frodo&#x27;s feeling that he has &quot;stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Elder Days, and was now walking in a world that was no more&quot; may be exactly correct.

===Elfland where time is different===

Shippey writes that in Lothlórien, Tolkien reconciles otherwise conflicting ideas regarding time-distortion in Elfland from European folklore, such as is exemplified in the medieval &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot;, who was carried off by the Queen of Elfland, and the Danish ballad &quot;Elvehøj&quot; (&quot;Elf Hill&quot;).

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger writes that the Fellowship debated how much time had passed while they were there, Sam Gamgee recalling that the moon was waning just before they arrived, and was new when they left, though they all felt they had only been there for a few days. She notes that Sam actually exclaims &quot;Anyone would think that time did not count in there!&quot;, while Frodo sees Galadriel as &quot;present and yet remote, a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of Time&quot; and Legolas, an Elf who ought to know how things work in Elven lands, says that time does not stop there, &quot;but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because they themselves change little, and all else fleets by. Slow, because they do not count the running years&quot;.

Shippey considers Legolas&#x27;s explanation to resolve the apparent contradiction between the mortal and Elvish points of view about Elvish time. Flieger however writes that there is a definite contradiction between Frodo&#x27;s position, that there is an actual difference in time between Lothlórien and everywhere else, and Legolas&#x27;s, that it is a matter of perception. She considers Aragorn&#x27;s view to reconcile these two positions, agreeing that time has passed as Legolas said, but that the Fellowship felt time as the Elves did while they were in Lothlórien. That is not, writes Flieger, the end of the matter, as she feels that Aragorn reintroduces the dilemma when he says that the moon carried on changing &quot;in the world outside&quot;: this suggests once again that Lothlórien had its own laws of nature, as in a fairy tale.

Flieger writes that while time is treated both naturally and supernaturally throughout &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, his &quot;most mystical and philosophical deployment of time&quot; concerns Elves. It is therefore &quot;no accident&quot;, she writes, that Frodo has multiple experiences of altered time in Lothlórien, from feeling he has crossed &quot;a bridge of Time&quot; on entering that land, to seeing Aragorn on Cerin Amroth as he was as a young man, dressed in white. Flieger notes that in &quot;The Monsters and the Critics&quot; Tolkien writes &quot;The human-stories of the elves are doubtless full of the Escape from Deathlessness&quot;. In her view, this explains the exploration of time in his mythology, death and deathlessness being the &quot;concomitants&quot; of time and timelessness.

=== A remembered Warwickshire===
The author John Garth writes of a possible Warwickshire connection for Lothlórien. The young Tolkien and his fiancée Edith Bratt visited Warwick; in 1915 he wrote a celebration of Warwickshire, &quot;Kortirion Among the Trees&quot;. Garth suggests that the central green hill of Cerin Amroth in Lothlórien recalls the grassy Motte of Warwick Castle, known as Ethelfleda&#x27;s Mound and the happy time he spent there in his youth.

==Adaptations==
Lothlórien&#x27;s appearance in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy was based on the artwork of the conceptual designer Alan Lee. Some of the Lothlórien scenes were shot on locations in Paradise Valley near Glenorchy, New Zealand.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria&quot;, Lorien was a region introduced to the game in March 2009, which allows players to visit Caras Galadhon and other places, and complete quests from the elves.

Enya&#x27;s song &quot;Lothlórien&quot; on her album &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; is an instrumental composition named for the Elvish realm.

The Dutch composer Johan de Meij wrote music inspired by the Lothlórien woods, as the second movement, &quot;Lothlórien (The Elvenwood)&quot;, of his Symphony No. 1 &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

<text>Balrogs () are a species of powerful demonic monsters in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. One first appeared in print in his high-fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, where the Company of the Ring encounter a Balrog known as Durin&#x27;s Bane in the Mines of Moria. Balrogs appear also in Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and his legendarium. Balrogs are tall and menacing beings who can shroud themselves in fire, darkness, and shadow. They are armed with fiery whips &quot;of many thongs&quot;, and occasionally use long swords.

In Tolkien&#x27;s later conception, Balrogs could not be readily vanquished—a certain stature was required by the would-be hero. Only dragons rivalled their capacity for ferocity and destruction; during the First Age of Middle-earth, they were among the most feared of Morgoth&#x27;s forces. Their power came from their nature as Maiar, angelic beings like the Valar, though of lesser power.
Tolkien invented the name &quot;Balrog&quot;, providing an in-universe etymology for it as a word in his invented Sindarin language. He may have gained the idea of a fire demon from his philological study of the Old English word &quot;Sigelwara&quot;, which he studied in detail in the 1930s.
Balrogs appear in the film adaptations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by Ralph Bakshi and Peter Jackson, in the streaming series &quot;The Rings of Power&quot;, and in computer and video games based on Middle-earth.

==Context==
According to the mythology in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the evil Vala Melkor, later called &quot;Morgoth&quot;, corrupted lesser Maiar (angelic beings) to his service, as Balrogs, in the days of his splendour before the making of Arda. After the awakening of the Elves, the Valar captured Melkor and destroyed his fortresses Utumno and Angband. But they overlooked the deepest pits, where, with many of Melkor&#x27;s other allies, the Balrogs fled into hiding. When Melkor returned to Middle-earth from Valinor, he was attacked by the evil giant spider Ungoliant; his scream drew the Balrogs out of hiding to his rescue.

== Characteristics ==

Tolkien&#x27;s conception of Balrogs changed over time. In all his early writing, they are numerous. A host of a thousand is mentioned in the &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot;, while at the storming of Gondolin Balrogs in the hundreds ride on the backs of the Dragons. They are roughly of twice human size, and were rarely killed in battle. They were fierce demons, associated with fire, armed with fiery whips of many thongs and claws like steel, and Morgoth delighted in using them to torture his captives.

In the published version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, however, Balrogs became altogether more sinister and more powerful. Christopher Tolkien notes the difference, saying that in earlier versions they were &quot;less terrible and certainly more destructible&quot;. He quotes a very late marginal note that was not incorporated into the text saying &quot;at most seven&quot; ever existed; though in the &quot;Annals of Aman&quot;, written as late as 1958, Melkor still commands &quot;a host of Balrogs&quot;. In later writings they ceased to be creatures, but are instead Maiar, lesser Ainur like Gandalf or Sauron, spirits of fire whom Melkor had corrupted before the creation of the World. Power of the order of Gandalf&#x27;s was necessary to destroy them, as when Gandalf at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm tells the others &quot;This is a foe beyond any of you.&quot;

As Maiar, only the physical form of a Balrog could be destroyed. Tolkien says of the Valar and the Maiar that they can change their shape at will, and move &quot;unclad in the raiment of the world&quot;, meaning invisible and without form. But it seems that Morgoth, Sauron, and their associated Maiar could lose this ability: Morgoth, for example, was unable to heal his burns from the Silmarils or wounds from Fingolfin and the eagle Thorondor; and Sauron lost his ability to assume a fair-seeming form after his physical body was destroyed in the downfall of Númenor.

Tolkien does not address this specifically for Balrogs, though in his later conception, as at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, the Balrog appears &quot;like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater&quot;. Though previously the Balrog had entered the &quot;large square chamber&quot; of Mazarbul, at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm it &quot;drew itself to a great height, and its wings spread from wall to wall&quot; in the vast hall.
The Balrog&#x27;s size and shape, therefore, are not given precisely. When Gandalf threw it from the peak of Zirakzigil, the Balrog &quot;broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin&quot;. 
Whether Balrogs had wings (and if so, whether they could fly) is unclear. This is due both to Tolkien&#x27;s changing conception of Balrogs, and to the imprecise but suggestive and possibly figurative description of the Balrog that confronted Gandalf.

The Balrog of Moria used a flaming sword (&quot;From out of the shadow a red sword leapt flaming&quot;) and a many-thonged whip that &quot;whined and cracked&quot; in its battle with Gandalf. In &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, they also used black axes and maces. Earlier writings also speak of steel claws and iron mail.

In earlier drafts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, some further indications of Tolkien&#x27;s evolving conceptions appear, as when

At this writing Tolkien contemplated an edict of the Valar concerning Balrogs, having Gandalf challenge the Balrog by saying &quot;It is forbidden for any Balrog to come beneath the sky since Fionwë son of Manwë overthrew Thangorodrim.&quot;

==Individual Balrogs==

===Gothmog===
Gothmog is developed in successive versions of &quot;Silmarillion&quot; material. He is physically massive and strong, and in one version he is some 12 feet tall. He wields a black axe and whip of flame as his weapons. He holds the titles of the Lord of the Balrogs, the High Captain of Angband, and Marshal of the Hosts. In the Second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath, he leads a force that ambushes Fëanor and wounds him mortally. He leads Balrogs, Orc-hosts, and Dragons as Morgoth&#x27;s commander in the field in the Fifth Battle, Nírnaeth Arnoediad, and slays Fingon, High King of the Noldor. In that same battle, he captures Húrin of Dor-lómin, who had slain his personal guard of Battle-trolls, and brings him to Angband. As Marshal of the Hosts, he is in command of the Storming of Gondolin. He is about to kill Tuor when Ecthelion of the Fountain, a Noldorin Elf-lord, intervenes. Gothmog fights Ecthelion in single combat, and they kill each other.

In &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, Tolkien describes &quot;Kosomot&quot;, the original version of Gothmog, as a son of Morgoth and the ogress Fluithuin or Ulbandi. &quot;Gothmog&quot; is Sindarin for &quot;Dread Oppressor&quot;. &quot;Kosomot&quot; is often considered Gothmog&#x27;s Quenya name; however, in the Quenya name-list of &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot; another version appears, &quot;Kosomoko&quot;.

In Tolkien&#x27;s early &quot;Lay of the Children of Húrin&quot; is &quot;Lungorthin, Lord of Balrogs&quot;. This might be another name for Gothmog, though Christopher Tolkien thought it more likely that Lungorthin was simply &quot;a Balrog lord&quot;.

===Durin&#x27;s Bane===
This Balrog appears in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, encountered by the Company of the Ring in the Mines of Moria. It survived the defeat of Morgoth in the War of Wrath, escaping to hide beneath the Misty Mountains. For more than five millennia, the Balrog remained in its deep hiding place at the roots of Caradhras, one of the Mountains of Moria, until in the Third Age, the &quot;mithril&quot;-miners of the Dwarf-kingdom of Khazad-dûm disturbed it. The Balrog killed Durin VI, the Dwarf-King of Khazad-dûm, whereafter it was called Durin&#x27;s Bane by the Dwarves. Avarice, principally for &quot;mithril&quot;, drove the dwarves to go too deep and awaken the Balrog.

The Dwarves attempted to fight the Balrog, but its power was far too great for them. In their efforts to hold Khazad-dûm against it, many Dwarves were killed: Durin&#x27;s successor Náin ruled for only a year. The survivors were forced to flee. This disaster reached the Silvan Elves of Lothlórien, many of whom fled the &quot;Nameless Terror&quot;. From this time Khazad-dûm was known as &quot;Moria&quot;, Sindarin for &quot;Black Pit&quot; or &quot;Black Chasm&quot;.

For another 500 years, Moria was left to the Balrog; though according to &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, Orcs crept in soon after the Dwarves were driven out, leading to Nimrodel&#x27;s flight. Sauron began to put his plans for war into effect, and he sent Orcs and Trolls to the Misty Mountains to bar the passes.

During the reign of Thráin II, the Dwarves attempted to retake Moria in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, culminating in the Battle of Azanulbizar before the eastern gate of Moria. This was a victory for the Dwarves, but the Balrog prevented them from reoccupying Moria. Dáin II Ironfoot, having slain the Orc Azog near the gate, perceived the terror of the Balrog within and warned Thráin that Moria was unachievable until some greater force could remove the Balrog. The Dwarves departed and resumed their exile. Despite Dáin&#x27;s warning, Balin made another attempt to retake Moria. His party managed to start a colony, but was massacred a few years later.

The Fellowship of the Ring travelled through Moria on the quest to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom. They were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when the wizard Gandalf the Grey tried to place a &quot;shutting spell&quot; on the door to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on the other side and cast a &quot;terrible&quot; counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of Command to stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed. Gandalf was weakened by this encounter. The company fled with him, but the Orcs and the Balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Elf Legolas instantly recognized the Balrog and Gandalf tried to hold the bridge against it. As Gandalf faced the Balrog, he proclaimed, &quot;You cannot pass, flame of Udûn!&quot;, and broke the bridge beneath the Balrog. As it fell, the Balrog wrapped its whip about Gandalf&#x27;s knees, dragging him to the brink. As the Fellowship looked on in horror, Gandalf cried &quot;Fly, you fools!&quot; and plunged into the darkness below.

After a long fall, the two crashed into a deep subterranean lake, which extinguished the flames of the Balrog&#x27;s body; however it remained &quot;a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake&quot;. They fought in the water; the Balrog clutched at Gandalf to strangle him, and Gandalf hewed the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled into the primordial tunnels of Moria&#x27;s underworld. Gandalf pursued the monster for eight days, until they climbed to the peak of Zirakzigil, where the Balrog was forced to turn and fight, its body erupting into new flame. Here they fought for two days and nights. In the end, the Balrog was defeated and cast down, breaking the mountainside where it fell &quot;in ruin&quot;. Gandalf himself died shortly afterwards, but he returned to Middle-earth with greater powers, as &quot;Gandalf the White&quot;, &quot;until his task was finished&quot;. Critics such as Jerram Barrs have recognised this as a transfiguration similar to that of Jesus Christ, suggesting Gandalf&#x27;s prophet-like status.

The critic Clive Tolley notes that the contest between Gandalf and the Balrog on Durin&#x27;s bridge somewhat recalls a shamanistic contest, but that a far closer parallel is medieval vision literature, giving the example of &quot;St Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory&quot;, and even Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

== In-universe origins==

The name &quot;Balrog&quot;, but not the meaning, emerges early in Tolkien&#x27;s work: it appears in &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;, one of the earliest texts Tolkien wrote, around 1918. Tolkien began a poem in alliterative verse about the battle of Glorfindel with the Balrog in that text, where both were killed by falling into the abyss, just like Gandalf and the Balrog in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

An early list of names described &quot;Balrog&quot; as &quot;an Orc-word with no pure equivalent in Tolkien&#x27;s invented language of Quenya: &#x27;borrowed Malaroko-&#x27; &quot;. 
In Gnomish (another of Tolkien&#x27;s invented languages), &quot;Balrog&quot; is parsed as &quot;balc&quot; &#x27;cruel&#x27; + &quot;graug&quot; &#x27;demon&#x27;, with a Quenya equivalent &quot;Malkarauke&quot;. Variant forms of the latter include &quot;Nalkarauke&quot; and &quot;Valkarauke&quot;.
By the 1940s, when Tolkien began writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, he had come to think of Balrog as Noldorin &quot;balch&quot; &#x27;cruel&#x27; + &quot;rhaug&quot; &#x27;demon&#x27;, with a Quenya equivalent &quot;Malarauko&quot; (from &quot;nwalya-&quot; &#x27;to torture&#x27; + &quot;rauko&quot; &#x27;demon&#x27;). 
The last etymology, appearing in the invented languages Quendi and Eldar, derives &quot;Balrog&quot; as the Sindarin translation of the Quenya form &quot;Valarauko&quot; (Demon of Might). This etymology was published in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.
Gandalf on the bridge of Khazad-dûm calls the Balrog &quot;flame of Udûn&quot; ( the Sindarin name of Morgoth&#x27;s fortress &quot;Utumno&quot;).

== Real-world origins ==

=== &quot;Sigelwara&quot; ===

Tolkien was a professional philologist, a scholar of comparative and historical linguistics. The Balrog and other concepts in his writings derived from the Old English word &quot;Sigelwara&quot;, used in texts such as the &quot;Codex Junius&quot; to mean &quot;Aethiopian&quot;. He wondered why the Anglo-Saxons would have had a word with this meaning, conjecturing that it had formerly had a different meaning. He emended the word to &quot;Sigelhearwan&quot;, and in his essay &quot;Sigelwara Land&quot;, explored in detail the two parts of the word. He stated that &quot;Sigel&quot; meant &quot;both &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;jewel&quot;&quot;, the former as it was the name of the Sun rune *sowilō (ᛋ), the latter connotation from Latin &quot;sigillum&quot;, a seal. He decided that &quot;Hearwa&quot; was related to Old English &quot;heorð&quot;, &quot;hearth&quot;, and ultimately to Latin &quot;carbo&quot;, &quot;soot&quot;. He suggested from all this that &quot;Sigelhearwan&quot; implied &quot;rather the sons of Muspell than of Ham&quot;, a class of demons in Northern mythology &quot;with red-hot eyes that emitted sparks and faces black as soot&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey states that this both &quot;helped to naturalise the Balrog&quot; and contributed to the Silmarils, which combined the nature of the sun and jewels. The Aethiopians suggested to Tolkien the Haradrim, a dark southern race of men.

=== Old Norse, Old English ===

A real-world etymological counterpart for the word &quot;Balrog&quot; existed long before Tolkien&#x27;s languages, in Norse mythology; an epithet of the Norse god Odin was &quot;Báleygr&quot;, &quot;fire-eyed&quot;.

Joe Abbott, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, notes that the Old Norse &quot;Voluspa&quot; mentions that the fire-demon Surt carries both a sword and a &quot;sviga laevi&quot;, a deadly whipping-stick or switch; he suggests that it is &quot;a short step&quot; from that to the Balrog&#x27;s flaming whip. Abbott makes a connection, too, with the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet&#x27;s account of the monster Grendel: he notes that Tolkien wrote that Grendel was &quot;physical enough in form and power, but vaguely felt as belonging to a different order of being, one allied to the malevolent &#x27;ghosts&#x27; of the dead&quot;, and compares this with Aragorn&#x27;s description of the Balrog as &quot;both a shadow and a flame, strong and terrible&quot;.

=== Moria and the Battle of Maldon ===
Tolkien felt acutely the error made by the English commander, the ealdorman Byrhtnoth, at the Battle of Maldon, allowing the Vikings to step ashore and win the battle. Alexander Bruce, in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, comments that Tolkien may have used Gandalf&#x27;s battle with the Balrog on the narrow bridge in Moria to &quot;correct the behavior of the self-serving Byrhtnoth through the actions of the self-less Gandalf&quot;. Bruce notes that the Tolkien scholar Janet Brennan Croft also contrasts the two leaders.

=== The fall of Gondolin and the fall of Troy ===
There are multiple parallels between the &quot;Fall of Gondolin&quot; and the fall of Troy, as told in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, but again the tales differ. The Elf Ecthelion leads the charge against the Orcs, and fights Gothmog, the greatest Balrog; they wound each other and both fall into the king&#x27;s fountain in Gondolin; both drown. Bruce compares this to how Aeneas rallies the Trojans, but fails, and sees king Priam perish.

== Adaptations ==

The Balrog in Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated version was named Durin&#x27;s Bane and had large wings like those of a bat. Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2001 and 2002 films &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; had similar wings, expressing its &quot;satanic, demonic nature&quot;. Earlier artists such as Ted Nasmith had depicted Balrogs without wings; Jackson&#x27;s films used the design of Tolkien illustrator John Howe, making wings standard, in the same way that Jackson has made pointed ears standard for elves. A Balrog appears in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;, with a similar visual design to Jackson&#x27;s monster.

Balrogs appear in Middle-earth computer and video games and merchandise. In the real-time strategy game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth&quot;, and its sequel, both based on Jackson&#x27;s movies, the Balrog can use its wings, although only in short leaps. In the role-playing game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age&quot;, also based on the Jackson movies, the Balrog uses its wings to fly into the air, and comes crashing down, sending a damaging shockwave of flames at the player. In another game based on Jackson&#x27;s movies, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Conquest&quot;, the Balrog is a playable hero.

A Balrog features in King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Murder of the Universe&quot; (2017) as a giant reanimated monster. Songwriter Stu Mackenzie explained: &quot;It might not be the Balrog from Middle Earth, but he is a sort of fire demon.&quot;

Early &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; books featured Balrogs among other Middle-earth characters like Hobbits and Ents; after a lawsuit brought by the Tolkien Estate, these Tolkien-specific names were changed, the Balrogs becoming Balor, after the one-eyed monster of Irish mythology.

== In culture ==


A now-defunct fantasy writing prize, the Balrog Award, was named after the monsters. The Japanese novel series &quot;Restaurant to Another World&quot; introduces a Balrog as a butler; this Balrog is described as polite.
