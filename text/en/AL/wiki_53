<doc id="61414" wikidata="Q2305746" url="?curid=61414" title="Kerio River">
<text>The Kerio River is a river in Turkana County, Kenya. It flows northward into Lake Turkana. It is one of the longest rivers in Kenya (about ), originating near the equator.

==Course==

The Kerio River rises on the north slopes of the Amasya Hills to the west of Lake Bogoria.
It flows northward through the Kerio Valley between Tugen Hills and Elgeyo Escarpment.
The Elgeyo Escarpment rises to over above the Kerio valley in places.
The Kerio continues northward, often through deep and narrow valleys, to enter Lake Turkana in a delta just south of the delta formed by the Turkwel and Lokichar rivers. 
The Kerio and Turkwel contribute 98% of the river water flowing into Lake Turkana on Kenyan territory (which makes up only 2% of the total riverine inflow). In their lower courses both these rivers are seasonal.

Near its source the Kerio River is fed by two major tributaries flowing down the Elgeyo Escarpment: Arror River, and Embobut River.

==Land use==

The Lake Kamnarok National Reserve and Kerio Valley National Reserve lie on the east and west sides of the Kerio River in the upper valley. They are undeveloped, but have abundant birdlife and are known for their scenery.
The left bank of a section of the river is in the South Turkana National Reserve.

In 1999 there were allegations that Fluorspar Mines was dumping toxic waste into the river. These were denied by the responsible Minister for Mineral Exploration.
The main locations in Turkana District for irrigated agriculture are along the Turkwel and Kerio rivers. The Lotubai and Morulem irrigation schemes are on the Kerio.
The main crops are maize and sorghum, which account for 80% of irrigated crops, as well as green grams, cowpeas, bananas, mangoes, oranges and guavas.

<doc id="61416" wikidata="Q28976" url="?curid=61416" title="Alexander Cartwright">
<text>Alexander Joy Cartwright Jr. (April 17, 1820 – July 12, 1892) was a founding member of the New York Knickerbockers Base Ball Club in the 1840s. Although he was an inductee of the Baseball Hall of Fame and he was sometimes referred to as a &quot;father of baseball&quot;, the importance of his role in the development of the game has been disputed.

The rules of the modern game were long considered to have been based on the Knickerbocker Rules developed in 1845 by Cartwright and a committee from the Knickerbockers. However, later research called this scenario into question. The myth of Abner Doubleday having invented baseball was believed by many, but in Cooperstown in 1939, the myth was debunked. Cartwright was inducted into the Hall of Fame as a pioneering contributor to the game, 46 years after his death. Although it has been stated that Cartwright was officially declared the inventor of the modern game of baseball by the 83rd United States Congress on June 3, 1953, the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, the &quot;House Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Senate Journal&quot; from June 3, 1953, did not mention Cartwright.

== Early life and work ==
Cartwright was born in 1820 to Alexander Cartwright Sr. (1784–1855), a merchant sea captain, and Esther Rebecca Burlock Cartwright (1792–1871). Alexander Jr. had six siblings. He first worked at the age of 16 in 1836 as a clerk for a Wall Street broker, later doing clerical work at the Union Bank of New York. After hours, he played bat-and-ball games in the streets of Manhattan with volunteer firefighters. Cartwright himself was a volunteer, first with Oceana Hose Company No. 36, and then Knickerbocker Engine Company No. 12.
Cartwright&#x27;s ancestor Thomas Cartwright, of Aynho Park, Northamptonshire was an English landowner and Tory politician, who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1695 and 1748. As the longest serving member he was dubbed Father of the House.

A fire destroyed the Union Bank in 1845, forcing Cartwright to find other work. He became a bookseller with his brother, Alfred.

== Knickerbocker Base Ball Club ==

One of the earliest known established clubs was the Gotham Base Ball Club, who played a brand of bat-and-ball game often called &quot;town ball&quot; or &quot;round ball,&quot; but in New York more usually &quot;base ball,&quot; similar but not identical to the British sport of rounders, on a field at 4th Avenue and 27th Street. In 1837, Gotham member William R. Wheaton drew up rules converting this playground game into a more elaborate and interesting sport to be played by adults. In 1842, Cartwright led the establishment of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club (named after the Knickerbocker Fire Engine Company), a breakaway group from the Gothams.

In 1845, a committee from the new club including Wheaton (but not Cartwright) drew up rules resembling those of the Gothams. The major precepts included the stipulations that foul territories were to be introduced for the first time, and the practice of retiring a runner by hitting him with a thrown ball was forbidden. Cartwright is also erroneously credited for introducing flat bases at uniform distances, three strikes per batter, and nine players in the outfield. However, modern scholarship has cast doubt on the originality of these rules, as information has come to light about the New York clubs that predated the Knickerbockers, in particular the rules devised by William R. Wheaton for the Gotham Club in 1837. Baseball historian Jeffrey Kittel has concluded that none of the Knickerbocker Rules of 1845 was original, with the possible exception of three-out innings. As MLB&#x27;s Official Historian John Thorn wrote, Cartwright has &quot;a plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame on which every word of substance is false. Alex Cartwright did not set the base paths at ninety feet, the sides at nine men, or the game at nine innings.&quot; (In fact, all three were established by the inter-club Convention of 1857, eight years after Cartwright had left New York).

The first clearly documented match between two baseball clubs under these rules took place on June 19, 1846, at Elysian Fields in Hoboken, New Jersey. In this match, the Knickerbockers lost to the &quot;New York nine&quot; (probably the parent Gotham Club) by a score of 23 to 1. Some authors have also questioned the supposed &quot;first game&quot; under the new rules. The Knickerbockers&#x27; scorebook shows intra-club games during 1845; the New York Base Ball Club played at least three games against a Brooklyn club in 1845 also, but the rules used are unknown. Those who have studied the score-book have concluded that the differences in the games of 1845 and 1846, compared with the specifications of the Knickerbocker rules, are minimal.

== Hawaii ==
In 1849, Cartwright headed to California for the gold rush, and then continued on to work and live in the Kingdom of Hawaii. His family came to join him in 1851: wife Eliza Van Wie, son DeWitt (1843–1870), daughter Mary (1845–1869), and daughter Catherine (Kate) Lee (1849–1851). Their sons Bruce Cartwright (1853–1919) and Alexander Joy Cartwright III (1855–1921) were born in Hawaii. Some secondary sources claim Cartwright set up a baseball field on the island of Oahu at Makiki Field in 1852, but Nucciarone states that before 1866, the modern game of baseball was not known or even played in Honolulu. Also, she states that during Cartwright&#x27;s lifetime he was not declared or documented as an originator of baseball in Hawaii.
Cartwright served as fire chief of Honolulu from 1850 through June 30, 1863. He was an advisor to King David Kalākaua and Queen Emma. Cartwright died on July 12, 1892, six months before the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. One of the leaders of the overthrow movement was Lorrin A. Thurston, who played baseball with classmate Alexander Cartwright III at Punahou School. Cartwright was buried in Oahu Cemetery.

After about two decades of controversy, invention of America&#x27;s &quot;national game&quot; of baseball was attributed to Abner Doubleday by the Mills Commission (1905–1907). Some baseball historians promptly cried foul and others joined throughout the 20th century. Cartwright was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1938.

New York City librarian Robert W. Henderson documented Cartwright&#x27;s contributions to baseball in his 1947 book &quot;Bat, Ball, and Bishop&quot;. Although there is no question that Cartwright was a prominent figure in the early development of baseball, some students of baseball history have suggested that Henderson and others embellished Cartwright&#x27;s role. The primary complaint is that touting Cartwright as the &quot;true&quot; inventor of the modern game was an effort to find an alternative single individual to counter the &quot;invention&quot; of baseball by Abner Doubleday.

Cartwright was the subject of a 1973 biography, &quot;The Man Who Invented Baseball&quot;, by Harold Peterson. He was the subject of two biographies written in 2009. Jay Martin&#x27;s &quot;Live All You Can: Alexander Joy Cartwright &amp; the Invention of Modern Baseball&quot; supports Cartwright as the inventor of baseball, while &quot;Alexander Cartwright: The Life Behind the Baseball Legend&quot; by Monica Nucciarone credits Cartwright as one of the game&#x27;s pioneers but not its sole founder. The 2004 discovery of a newspaper interview with fellow Knickerbocker founder William R. Wheaton cast doubt on Cartwright&#x27;s role. Wheaton stated that most of the rules long attributed to Cartwright and the Knickerbockers had in fact been developed by the older Gotham Club before the Knickerbockers&#x27; founding.

In 1938, Makiki Field in Honolulu was renamed Cartwright Field.
The Cartwright Cup is awarded to the Hawaii state high school baseball champions each year.

== 1857 &quot;Laws of Base Ball&quot; ==

In 2016, experts verified the authenticity of a set of documents titled &quot;Laws of Base Ball&quot; written in 1857 by New York Knickerbockers president Daniel &quot;Doc&quot; Adams after a discussion with executives of 14 other New York-area clubs. The documents established the rules of the game, including - for the first time - nine innings, nine players on the field and 90-foot basepaths. Cartwright was not a participant at the 1857 meeting, as he was living in Hawaii.

<doc id="61419" wikidata="Q17086007" url="?curid=61419" title="Tokenization (data security)">
<text>Tokenization, when applied to data security, is the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no intrinsic or exploitable meaning or value. The token is a reference (i.e. identifier) that maps back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system. The mapping from original data to a token uses methods that render tokens infeasible to reverse in the absence of the tokenization system, for example using tokens created from random numbers. A one-way cryptographic function is used to convert the original data into tokens, making it difficult to recreate the original data without obtaining entry to the tokenization system&#x27;s resources. To deliver such services, the system maintains a vault database of tokens that are connected to the corresponding sensitive data. Protecting the system vault is vital to the system, and improved processes must be put in place to offer database integrity and physical security.

The tokenization system must be secured and validated using security best practices applicable to sensitive data protection, secure storage, audit, authentication and authorization. The tokenization system provides data processing applications with the authority and interfaces to request tokens, or detokenize back to sensitive data. 
The security and risk reduction benefits of tokenization require that the tokenization system is logically isolated and segmented from data processing systems and applications that previously processed or stored sensitive data replaced by tokens. Only the tokenization system can tokenize data to create tokens, or detokenize back to redeem sensitive data under strict security controls. The token generation method must be proven to have the property that there is no feasible means through direct attack, cryptanalysis, side channel analysis, token mapping table exposure or brute force techniques to reverse tokens back to live data.

Replacing live data with tokens in systems is intended to minimize exposure of sensitive data to those applications, stores, people and processes, reducing risk of compromise or accidental exposure and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Applications can operate using tokens instead of live data, with the exception of a small number of trusted applications explicitly permitted to detokenize when strictly necessary for an approved business purpose. Tokenization systems may be operated in-house within a secure isolated segment of the data center, or as a service from a secure service provider.

Tokenization may be used to safeguard sensitive data involving, for example, bank accounts, financial statements, medical records, criminal records, driver&#x27;s licenses, loan applications, stock trades, voter registrations, and other types of personally identifiable information (PII). Tokenization is often used in credit card processing. The PCI Council defines tokenization as &quot;a process by which the primary account number (PAN) is replaced with a surrogate value called a token. A PAN may be linked to a reference number through the tokenization process. In this case, the merchant simply has to retain the token and a reliable third party controls the relationship and holds the PAN. The token may be created independently of the PAN, or the PAN can be used as part of the data input to the tokenization technique. The communication between the merchant and the third-party supplier must be secure to prevent an attacker from intercepting to gain the PAN and the token.

De-tokenization is the reverse process of redeeming a token for its associated PAN value. The security of an individual token relies predominantly on the infeasibility of determining the original PAN knowing only the surrogate value&quot;. The choice of tokenization as an alternative to other techniques such as encryption will depend on varying regulatory requirements, interpretation, and acceptance by respective auditing or assessment entities. This is in addition to any technical, architectural or operational constraint that tokenization imposes in practical use.

== Concepts and origins ==

The concept of tokenization, as adopted by the industry today, has existed since the first currency systems emerged centuries ago as a means to reduce risk in handling high value financial instruments by replacing them with surrogate equivalents. In the physical world, coin tokens have a long history of use replacing the financial instrument of minted coins and banknotes. In more recent history, subway tokens and casino chips found adoption for their respective systems to replace physical currency and cash handling risks such as theft. Exonumia and scrip are terms synonymous with such tokens.

In the digital world, similar substitution techniques have been used since the 1970s as a means to isolate real data elements from exposure to other data systems. In databases for example, surrogate key values have been used since 1976 to isolate data associated with the internal mechanisms of databases and their external equivalents for a variety of uses in data processing. More recently, these concepts have been extended to consider this isolation tactic to provide a security mechanism for the purposes of data protection.

In the payment card industry, tokenization is one means of protecting sensitive cardholder data in order to comply with industry standards and government regulations.

Tokenization was applied to payment card data by Shift4 Corporation and released to the public during an industry Security Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2005. The technology is meant to prevent the theft of the credit card information in storage. Shift4 defines tokenization as: “The concept of using a non-decryptable piece of data to represent, by reference, sensitive or secret data. In payment card industry (PCI) context, tokens are used to reference cardholder data that is managed in a tokenization system, application or off-site secure facility.”

To protect data over its full lifecycle, tokenization is often combined with end-to-end encryption to secure data in transit to the tokenization system or service, with a token replacing the original data on return. For example, to avoid the risks of malware stealing data from low-trust systems such as point of sale (POS) systems, as in the Target breach of 2013, cardholder data encryption must take place prior to card data entering the POS and not after. Encryption takes place within the confines of a security hardened and validated card reading device and data remains encrypted until received by the processing host, an approach pioneered by Heartland Payment Systems as a means to secure payment data from advanced threats, now widely adopted by industry payment processing companies and technology companies. The PCI Council has also specified end-to-end encryption (certified point-to-point encryption—P2PE) for various service implementations in various PCI Council Point-to-point Encryption documents.

== The tokenization process ==
The process of tokenization consists of the following steps:

* The application sends the tokenization data and authentication information to the tokenization system. It is stopped if authentication fails and the data is delivered to an event management system. As a result, administrators can discover problems and effectively manage the system. The system moves on to the next phase if authentication is successful.
* Using one-way cryptographic techniques, a token is generated and kept in a highly secure data vault.
* The new token is provided to the application for further use.

Tokenization systems share several components according to established standards.

# Token Generation is the process of producing a token using any means, such as mathematically reversible cryptographic functions based on strong encryption algorithms and key management mechanisms, one-way nonreversible cryptographic functions (e.g., a hash function with strong, secret salt), or assignment via a randomly generated number. Random Number Generator (RNG) techniques are often the best choice for generating token values.
# Token Mapping – this is the process of assigning the created token value to its original value. To enable permitted look-ups of the original value using the token as the index, a secure cross-reference database must be constructed.
# Token Data Store – this is a central repository for the Token Mapping process that holds the original values as well as the related token values after the Token Generation process. On data servers, sensitive data and token values must be securely kept in encrypted format. 
# Encrypted Data Storage – this is the encryption of sensitive data while it is in transit.
# Management of Cryptographic Keys. Strong key management procedures are required for sensitive data encryption on Token Data Stores.

== Difference from encryption ==

Tokenization and “classic” encryption effectively protect data if implemented properly, and a computer security system may use both. While similar in certain regards, tokenization and classic encryption differ in a few key aspects. Both are cryptographic data security methods and they essentially have the same function, however they do so with differing processes and have different effects on the data they are protecting.

Tokenization is a non-mathematical approach that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes without altering the type or length of data. This is an important distinction from encryption because changes in data length and type can render information unreadable in intermediate systems such as databases. Tokenized data can still be processed by legacy systems which makes tokenization more flexible than classic encryption.

In many situations, the encryption process is a constant consumer of processing power, hence such a system needs significant expenditures in specialized hardware and software.

Another difference is that tokens require significantly less computational resources to process. With tokenization, specific data is kept fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. This allows tokenized data to be processed more quickly and reduces the strain on system resources. This can be a key advantage in systems that rely on high performance.

In comparison to encryption, tokenization technologies reduce time, expense, and administrative effort while enabling teamwork and communication.

== Types of tokens ==
There are many ways that tokens can be classified however there is currently no unified classification. Tokens can be: single or multi-use, cryptographic or non-cryptographic, reversible or irreversible, authenticable or non-authenticable, and various combinations thereof.

In the context of payments, the difference between high and low value tokens plays a significant role.

=== High-value tokens (HVTs) ===
HVTs serve as surrogates for actual PANs in payment transactions and are used as an instrument for completing a payment transaction. In order to function, they must look like actual PANs. Multiple HVTs can map back to a single PAN and a single physical credit card without the owner being aware of it. Additionally, HVTs can be limited to certain networks and/or merchants whereas PANs cannot.

HVTs can also be bound to specific devices so that anomalies between token use, physical devices, and geographic locations can be flagged as potentially fraudulent. HVT blocking enhances efficiency by reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy and reducing record linkage as it reduces the number of records that are compared.

=== Low-value tokens (LVTs) or security tokens ===
LVTs also act as surrogates for actual PANs in payment transactions, however they serve a different purpose. LVTs cannot be used by themselves to complete a payment transaction. In order for an LVT to function, it must be possible to match it back to the actual PAN it represents, albeit only in a tightly controlled fashion. Using tokens to protect PANs becomes ineffectual if a tokenization system is breached, therefore securing the tokenization system itself is extremely important.

== System operations, limitations and evolution ==
First generation tokenization systems use a database to map from live data to surrogate substitute tokens and back. This requires the storage, management, and continuous backup for every new transaction added to the token database to avoid data loss. Another problem is ensuring consistency across data centers, requiring continuous synchronization of token databases. Significant consistency, availability and performance trade-offs, per the CAP theorem, are unavoidable with this approach. This overhead adds complexity to real-time transaction processing to avoid data loss and to assure data integrity across data centers, and also limits scale. Storing all sensitive data in one service creates an attractive target for attack and compromise, and introduces privacy and legal risk in the aggregation of data Internet privacy, particularly in the EU.

Another limitation of tokenization technologies is measuring the level of security for a given solution through independent validation. With the lack of standards, the latter is critical to establish the strength of tokenization offered when tokens are used for regulatory compliance. The PCI Council recommends independent vetting and validation of any claims of security and compliance: &quot;Merchants considering the use of tokenization should perform a thorough evaluation and risk analysis to identify and document the unique characteristics of their particular implementation, including all interactions with payment card data and the particular tokenization systems and processes&quot;

The method of generating tokens may also have limitations from a security perspective. With concerns about security and attacks to random number generators, which are a common choice for the generation of tokens and token mapping tables, scrutiny must be applied to ensure proven and validated methods are used versus arbitrary design. Random-number generators have limitations in terms of speed, entropy, seeding and bias, and security properties must be carefully analysed and measured to avoid predictability and compromise.

With tokenization&#x27;s increasing adoption, new tokenization technology approaches have emerged to remove such operational risks and complexities and to enable increased scale suited to emerging big data use cases and high performance transaction processing, especially in financial services and banking. In addition to conventional tokenization methods, Protegrity provides additional security through its so-called &quot;obfuscation layer.&quot; This creates a barrier that prevents not only regular users from accessing information they wouldn&#x27;t see but also privileged users who has access, such as database administrators.

Stateless tokenization allows live data elements to be mapped to surrogate values randomly, without relying on a database, while maintaining the isolation properties of tokenization.

November 2014, American Express released its token service which meets the EMV tokenization standard. Other notable examples of Tokenization-based payment systems, according to the EMVCo standard, include Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Microsoft Wallet, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. Visa uses tokenization techniques to provide a secure online and mobile shopping.

Using blockchain, as opposed to relying on trusted third parties, it is possible to run highly accessible, tamper-resistant databases for transactions. With help of blockchain, tokenization is the process of converting the value of a tangible or intangible asset into a token that can be exchanged on the network.

This enables the tokenization of conventional financial assets, for instance, by transforming rights into a digital token backed by the asset itself using blockchain technology. Besides that, tokenization enables the simple and efficient compartmentalization and management of data across multiple users. Individual tokens created through tokenization can be used to split ownership and partially resell an asset. Consequently, only entities with the appropriate token can access the data.

Numerous blockchain companies support asset tokenization. In 2019, eToro acquired Firmo and renamed as eToroX. Through its Token Management Suite, which is backed by USD-pegged stablecoins, eToroX enables asset tokenization.

The tokenization of equity is facilitated by STOKR, a platform that links investors with small and medium-sized businesses. Tokens issued through the STOKR platform are legally recognized as transferable securities under European Union capital market regulations.

Breakers enable tokenization of intellectual property, allowing content creators to issue their own digital tokens. Tokens can be distributed to a variety of project participants. Without intermediaries or governing body, content creators can integrate reward-sharing features into the token.

== Application to alternative payment systems ==
Building an alternate payments system requires a number of entities working together in order to deliver near field-communication (NFC) or other technology based payment services to the end users. One of the issues is the interoperability between the players and to resolve this issue the role of trusted service manager (TSM) is proposed to establish a technical link between mobile network operators (MNO) and providers of services, so that these entities can work together. Tokenization can play a role in mediating such services.

Tokenization as a security strategy lies in the ability to replace a real card number with a surrogate (target removal) and the subsequent limitations placed on the surrogate card number (risk reduction). If the surrogate value can be used in an unlimited fashion or even in a broadly applicable manner, the token value gains as much value as the real credit card number. In these cases, the token may be secured by a second dynamic token that is unique for each transaction and also associated to a specific payment card. Example of dynamic, transaction-specific tokens include cryptograms used in the EMV specification.

== Application to PCI DSS standards ==
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, an industry-wide set of guidelines that must be met by any organization that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data, mandates that credit card data must be protected when stored. Tokenization, as applied to payment card data, is often implemented to meet this mandate, replacing credit card and ACH numbers in some systems with a random value or string of characters. Tokens can be formatted in a variety of ways. Some token service providers or tokenization products generate the surrogate values in such a way as to match the format of the original sensitive data. In the case of payment card data, a token might be the same length as a Primary Account Number (bank card number) and contain elements of the original data such as the last four digits of the card number. When a payment card authorization request is made to verify the legitimacy of a transaction, a token might be returned to the merchant instead of the card number, along with the authorization code for the transaction. The token is stored in the receiving system while the actual cardholder data is mapped to the token in a secure tokenization system. Storage of tokens and payment card data must comply with current PCI standards, including the use of strong cryptography.

== Standards (ANSI, the PCI Council, Visa, and EMV) ==
Tokenization is currently in standards definition in ANSI X9 as X9.119 Part 2. X9 is responsible for the industry standards for financial cryptography and data protection including payment card PIN management, credit and debit card encryption and related technologies and processes. The PCI Council has also stated support for tokenization in reducing risk in data breaches, when combined with other technologies such as Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) and assessments of compliance to PCI DSS guidelines. Visa Inc. released Visa Tokenization Best Practices for tokenization uses in credit and debit card handling applications and services. In March 2014, EMVCo LLC released its first payment tokenization specification for EMV. PCI DSS is the most frequently utilized standard for Tokenization systems used by payment industry players.

== Risk reduction ==
Tokenization can render it more difficult for attackers to gain access to sensitive data outside of the tokenization system or service. Implementation of tokenization may simplify the requirements of the PCI DSS, as systems that no longer store or process sensitive data may have a reduction of applicable controls required by the PCI DSS guidelines.

As a security best practice, independent assessment and validation of any technologies used for data protection, including tokenization, must be in place to establish the security and strength of the method and implementation before any claims of privacy compliance, regulatory compliance, and data security can be made. This validation is particularly important in tokenization, as the tokens are shared externally in general use and thus exposed in high risk, low trust environments. The infeasibility of reversing a token or set of tokens to a live sensitive data must be established using industry accepted measurements and proofs by appropriate experts independent of the service or solution provider.

== Restrictions on token use ==
Not all organizational data can be tokenized, and needs to be examined and filtered.

When databases are utilized on a large scale, they expand exponentially, causing the search process to take longer, restricting system performance, and increasing backup processes. A database that links sensitive information to tokens is called a vault. With the addition of new data, the vault&#x27;s maintenance workload increases significantly.

For ensuring database consistency, token databases need to be continuously synchronized.

Apart from that, secure communication channels must be built between sensitive data and the vault so that data is not compromised on the way to or from storage.

<doc id="61424" wikidata="Q1108659" url="?curid=61424" title="Republic of Benin (1967)">
<text>The Republic of Benin was a short-lived unrecognized secessionist state in West Africa that existed for seven hours in 1967. It was established on 19 September 1967 during the Nigerian Civil War as a puppet state of Biafra, following its occupation of Nigeria&#x27;s Mid-Western Region, and named after its capital, Benin City, with Albert Nwazu Okonkwo as its head of government.

The new state was an attempt by Biafra to prevent non-Igbo residents of the neighbouring Mid-Western Region from siding with Nigeria following regional ethnic tensions early in the war. The Republic of Benin was officially declared even as the Nigerian federal forces were reconquering the region and ended the following day as they entered Benin City. The occupation of the Mid-Western Region turned residents against the secessionist cause and was used by the Nigerian government as justification to escalate the war against Biafra.

==History==
In the lead-up to the Nigerian Civil War, residents of the ethnically diverse Mid-Western Region attempted to take a neutral position. Shortly before Biafra announced its secession from Nigeria, leaders in the Mid-Western Region sponsored a peace conference near Benin City, and officials refused to permit Nigerian federal troops to invade Biafra through the region. In August 1967, Biafran forces occupied the Mid-Western Region and took control of the regional government, with American-educated doctor Albert Okonkwo as the new head of government under the title governor. Initially, the Igbo population welcomed Biafran control, while non-Igbos generally were unhappy but decided to wait for the restoration of federal control rather than resist. Initial relations between the new administration and non-Igbos were peaceful but uneasy. To improve relations, Okonkwo&#x27;s administration saturated homes and streets with news from the Biafran position. However, the mass media campaign began to fill the state with news about the oppression of the Igbo in Nigeria, and as the days passed, only increased the region&#x27;s ethnic divide. The endless public relations campaign destroyed non-Igbo sympathy for the pro-Biafran secessionist cause instead of converting them to outright support, with most adopting neutral or pro-Nigerian sympathies. As relations between the occupational government and non-Igbos continued to deteriorate, Biafran President C. Odumegwu Ojukwu visited the Mid-Western Region to raise support and met with leaders of the previously banned National Convention of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC). Although the visit prompted increased support among former NCNC partisans, their former intra-party discord reawakened. At the same time NCNC partisans began to clash with supporters of other parties. The non-Igbo rejection of the invasion was solidified. As Okonkwo&#x27;s administration continued to lose the support of the Mid-Western Region&#x27;s populace, they became desperate.

On 19 September 1967, the Biafrans rebranded the region by proclaiming the Republic of Benin, an independent state separate from Biafra, as a last-ditch effort. It was believed that even if it could not win non-Igbo support, the new state might at least physically divide Biafra from the Nigerian federal forces. Citing the deaths of Mid-Western residents in the northern riots and the region&#x27;s support for a confederate government in Nigeria, Okonkwo declared that the Republic of Benin would support Biafra in all causes and would participate in organisations such as the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. However, Okonkwo and other officials had discussed an independence declaration two weeks earlier on 5 September without coming to an agreement, and the announcement was recorded in a short lull as he and his military forces retreated in the face of a federal government military advance. Later in the same day, government troops reached Benin City, the Republic of Benin&#x27;s capital city, and the British high commissioner reported crowds lining the streets to celebrate the reconquest. Meanwhile, Biafran President Ojukwu offered no comment on the declaration, concentrating instead on Biafran soldiers&#x27; failure to stop the government&#x27;s advance. Biafra had won limited recognition from some foreign states, but all gains were unrelated to the proclamation of Benin. The Biafran occupation of the Mid-Western Region failed to achieve its objectives and severely damaged domestic support for the secessionist cause among non-Igbos, and was perceived by the Nigerian federal government as justification to escalate the minor conflict into full-fledged war.

The latter sent emissaries to Rome, seeking help in dealing with the migration. The Senate sends consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo across the Julian Alps, to deal with the migration at the head of an army (some 30,000 men). He offers guides to escort them out of the territory of the Taurisci. The guides are instructed to lead the tribes to the town of Noreia, where Carbo sets an ambush. The Cimbri manage to discover Carbo&#x27;s plan, they turn the tables and defeat the Romans during an ambush. Carbo manages to escape with the remnants of his consular army (some 6,000 men) during a heavy thunderstorm. Later, he is indicted by the Senate for losing the battle, but escapes conviction by committing suicide.

<text>In mathematics, the radius of convergence of a power series is the radius of the largest disk at the center of the series in which the series converges. It is either a non-negative real number or formula_1. When it is positive, the power series converges absolutely and uniformly on compact sets inside the open disk of radius equal to the radius of convergence, and it is the Taylor series of the analytic function to which it converges. In case of multiple singularities of a function (singularities are those values of the argument for which the function is not defined), the radius of convergence is the shortest or minimum of all the respective distances (which are all non-negative numbers) calculated from the center of the disk of convergence to the respective singularities of the function.

==Definition==
For a power series &quot;f&quot; defined as:

:formula_2

where

*&quot;a&quot; is a complex constant, the center of the disk of convergence,
*&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;-th complex coefficient, and
*&quot;z&quot; is a complex variable.

The radius of convergence &quot;r&quot; is a nonnegative real number or formula_1 such that the series converges if

:formula_4

and diverges if

:formula_5

Some may prefer an alternative definition, as existence is obvious:

: formula_6

On the boundary, that is, where |&quot;z&quot; − &quot;a&quot;| = &quot;r&quot;, the behavior of the power series may be complicated, and the series may converge for some values of &quot;z&quot; and diverge for others. The radius of convergence is infinite if the series converges for all complex numbers &quot;z&quot;.

==Finding the radius of convergence==
Two cases arise:

* The first case is theoretical: when you know all the coefficients formula_7 then you take certain limits and find the precise radius of convergence. 
* The second case is practical: when you construct a power series solution of a difficult problem you typically will only know a finite number of terms in a power series, anywhere from a couple of terms to a hundred terms. In this second case, extrapolating a plot estimates the radius of convergence.

===Theoretical radius===

The radius of convergence can be found by applying the root test to the terms of the series. The root test uses the number

:formula_8

&quot;lim sup&quot; denotes the limit superior. The root test states that the series converges if &quot;C&quot; &lt; 1 and diverges if &quot;C&quot; &gt; 1. It follows that the power series converges if the distance from &quot;z&quot; to the center &quot;a&quot; is less than

:formula_9

and diverges if the distance exceeds that number; this statement is the Cauchy–Hadamard theorem. Note that &quot;r&quot; = 1/0 is interpreted as an infinite radius, meaning that &quot;f&quot; is an entire function.

The limit involved in the ratio test is usually easier to compute, and when that limit exists, it shows that the radius of convergence is finite.
:formula_10
This is shown as follows. The ratio test says the series converges if

: formula_11

That is equivalent to

: formula_12

=== Practical estimation of radius in the case of real coefficients ===
Usually, in scientific applications, only a finite number of coefficients formula_7 are known. Typically, as formula_14 increases, these coefficients settle into a regular behavior determined by the nearest radius-limiting singularity. In this case, two main techniques have been developed, based on the fact that the coefficients of a Taylor series are roughly exponential with ratio formula_15 where &quot;r&quot; is the radius of convergence.

* The basic case is when the coefficients ultimately share a common sign or alternate in sign. As pointed out earlier in the article, in many cases the limit formula_16 exists, and in this case formula_17. Negative formula_18 means the convergence-limiting singularity is on the negative axis. Estimate this limit, by plotting the formula_19 versus formula_20, and graphically extrapolate to formula_21 (effectively formula_22) via a linear fit. The intercept with formula_21 estimates the reciprocal of the radius of convergence, formula_15. This plot is called a Domb–Sykes plot.
* The more complicated case is when the signs of the coefficients have a more complex pattern. Mercer and Roberts proposed the following procedure. Define the associated sequence formula_25 Plot the finitely many known formula_26 versus formula_20, and graphically extrapolate to formula_21 via a linear fit. The intercept with formula_21 estimates the reciprocal of the radius of convergence, formula_15. This procedure also estimates two other characteristics of the convergence limiting singularity. Suppose the nearest singularity is of degree formula_31 and has angle formula_32 to the real axis. Then the slope of the linear fit given above is formula_33. Further, plot formula_34 versus formula_35, then a linear fit extrapolated to formula_36 has intercept at formula_37.

== Radius of convergence in complex analysis ==
A power series with a positive radius of convergence can be made into a holomorphic function by taking its argument to be a complex variable. The radius of convergence can be characterized by the following theorem:

: The radius of convergence of a power series &quot;f&quot; centered on a point &quot;a&quot; is equal to the distance from &quot;a&quot; to the nearest point where &quot;f&quot; cannot be defined in a way that makes it holomorphic.

The set of all points whose distance to &quot;a&quot; is strictly less than the radius of convergence is called the &quot;disk of convergence&quot;.

&quot;The nearest point&quot; means the nearest point in the complex plane, not necessarily on the real line, even if the center and all coefficients are real. For example, the function

: formula_38

has no singularities on the real line, since formula_39 has no real roots. Its Taylor series about 0 is given by

:formula_40

The root test shows that its radius of convergence is 1. In accordance with this, the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has singularities at ±&quot;i&quot;, which are at a distance 1 from 0.

For a proof of this theorem, see analyticity of holomorphic functions.

===A simple example===
The arctangent function of trigonometry can be expanded in a power series:

:formula_41

It is easy to apply the root test in this case to find that the radius of convergence is 1.

===A more complicated example===

Consider this power series:

:formula_42

where the rational numbers &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; are the Bernoulli numbers. It may be cumbersome to try to apply the ratio test to find the radius of convergence of this series. But the theorem of complex analysis stated above quickly solves the problem. At &quot;z&quot; = 0, there is in effect no singularity since the singularity is removable. The only non-removable singularities are therefore located at the &quot;other&quot; points where the denominator is zero. We solve

:formula_43

by recalling that if and then

:formula_44

and then take &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; to be real. Since &quot;y&quot; is real, the absolute value of is necessarily 1. Therefore, the absolute value of &quot;e&quot; can be 1 only if &quot;e&quot; is 1; since &quot;x&quot; is real, that happens only if &quot;x&quot; = 0. Therefore &quot;z&quot; is purely imaginary and . Since &quot;y&quot; is real, that happens only if cos(&quot;y&quot;) = 1 and sin(&quot;y&quot;) = 0, so that &quot;y&quot; is an integer multiple of 2. Consequently the singular points of this function occur at

: &quot;z&quot; = a nonzero integer multiple of 2&quot;i&quot;.

The singularities nearest 0, which is the center of the power series expansion, are at ±2&quot;i&quot;. The distance from the center to either of those points is 2, so the radius of convergence is 2.

== Convergence on the boundary ==
If the power series is expanded around the point &quot;a&quot; and the radius of convergence is , then the set of all points such that is a circle called the &quot;boundary&quot; of the disk of convergence. A power series may diverge at every point on the boundary, or diverge on some points and converge at other points, or converge at all the points on the boundary. Furthermore, even if the series converges everywhere on the boundary (even uniformly), it does not necessarily converge absolutely.

Example 1: The power series for the function , expanded around , which is simply
:formula_45 
has radius of convergence 1 and diverges at every point on the boundary.

Example 2: The power series for , expanded around , which is
:formula_46 
has radius of convergence 1, and diverges for but converges for all other points on the boundary. The function of Example 1 is the derivative of .

Example 3: The power series
:formula_47 
has radius of convergence 1 and converges everywhere on the boundary absolutely. If is the function represented by this series on the unit disk, then the derivative of &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is equal to &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)/&quot;z&quot; with &quot;g&quot; of Example 2. It turns out that is the dilogarithm function.

Example 4: The power series
:formula_48
has radius of convergence 1 and converges uniformly on the entire boundary , but does not converge absolutely on the boundary.

==Rate of convergence==

If we expand the function

:formula_49

around the point &quot;x&quot; = 0, we find out that the radius of convergence of this series is formula_1 meaning that this series converges for all complex numbers. However, in applications, one is often interested in the precision of a numerical answer. Both the number of terms and the value at which the series is to be evaluated affect the accuracy of the answer. For example, if we want to calculate accurate up to five decimal places, we only need the first two terms of the series. However, if we want the same precision for we must evaluate and sum the first five terms of the series. For , one requires the first 18 terms of the series, and for we need to evaluate the first 141 terms.

So for these particular values the fastest convergence of a power series expansion is at the center, and as one moves away from the center of convergence, the rate of convergence slows down until you reach the boundary (if it exists) and cross over, in which case the series will diverge.

==Abscissa of convergence of a Dirichlet series==

An analogous concept is the abscissa of convergence of a Dirichlet series

:formula_51

Such a series converges if the real part of &quot;s&quot; is greater than a particular number depending on the coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;: the abscissa of convergence.

<text>In mathematics, an analytic function is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series. There exist both real analytic functions and complex analytic functions. Functions of each type are infinitely differentiable, but complex analytic functions exhibit properties that do not generally hold for real analytic functions. 

A function is analytic if and only if for every formula_1 in its domain, its Taylor series about formula_1 converges to the function in some neighborhood of formula_1. This is stronger than merely being infinitely differentiable at formula_1, and therefore having a well-defined Taylor series; the Fabius function provides an example of a function that is infinitely differentiable but not analytic.

== Definitions ==

Formally, a function formula_5 is &quot;real analytic&quot; on an open set formula_6 in the real line if for any formula_7 one can write
formula_8

in which the coefficients formula_9 are real numbers and the series is convergent to formula_10 for formula_11 in a neighborhood of formula_12.

Alternatively, a real analytic function is an infinitely differentiable function such that the Taylor series at any point formula_12 in its domain

formula_14

converges to formula_10 for formula_11 in a neighborhood of formula_12 pointwise. The set of all real analytic functions on a given set formula_6 is often denoted by formula_19, or just by formula_20 if the domain is understood.

A function formula_5 defined on some subset of the real line is said to be real analytic at a point formula_11 if there is a neighborhood formula_6 of formula_11 on which formula_5 is real analytic.

The definition of a &quot;complex analytic function&quot; is obtained by replacing, in the definitions above, &quot;real&quot; with &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;real line&quot; with &quot;complex plane&quot;. A function is complex analytic if and only if it is holomorphic i.e. it is complex differentiable. For this reason the terms &quot;holomorphic&quot; and &quot;analytic&quot; are often used interchangeably for such functions.

== Examples ==
Typical examples of analytic functions are
* The following elementary functions:
** All polynomials: if a polynomial has degree &quot;n&quot;, any terms of degree larger than &quot;n&quot; in its Taylor series expansion must immediately vanish to 0, and so this series will be trivially convergent. Furthermore, every polynomial is its own Maclaurin series.
** The exponential function is analytic. Any Taylor series for this function converges not only for &quot;x&quot; close enough to &quot;x&quot;0 (as in the definition) but for all values of &quot;x&quot; (real or complex).
** The trigonometric functions, logarithm, and the power functions are analytic on any open set of their domain.
* Most special functions (at least in some range of the complex plane):
** hypergeometric functions
** Bessel functions
** gamma functions

Typical examples of functions that are not analytic are

* The absolute value function when defined on the set of real numbers or complex numbers is not everywhere analytic because it is not differentiable at 0.
* Piecewise defined functions (functions given by different formulae in different regions) are typically not analytic where the pieces meet.
* The complex conjugate function &quot;z&quot; → &quot;z&quot;* is not complex analytic, although its restriction to the real line is the identity function and therefore real analytic, and it is real analytic as a function from formula_26 to formula_26.
* Other non-analytic smooth functions, and in particular any smooth function formula_5 with compact support, i.e. formula_29, cannot be analytic on formula_30.

==Alternative characterizations==

The following conditions are equivalent:

#formula_5 is real analytic on an open set formula_6.
#There is a complex analytic extension of formula_5 to an open set formula_34 which contains formula_6.
#formula_5 is smooth and for every compact set formula_37 there exists a constant formula_38 such that for every formula_39 and every non-negative integer formula_40 the following bound holds formula_41

Complex analytic functions are exactly equivalent to holomorphic functions, and are thus much more easily characterized.

For the case of an analytic function with several variables (see below), the real analyticity can be characterized using the Fourier–Bros–Iagolnitzer transform. 

In the multivariable case, real analytic functions satisfy a direct generalization of the third characterization. Let formula_42 be an open set, and let formula_43. 

Then formula_5 is real analytic on formula_45 if and only if formula_46 and for every compact formula_47 there exists a constant formula_38 such that for every multi-index formula_49 the following bound holds

formula_50

==Properties of analytic functions==
* The sums, products, and compositions of analytic functions are analytic.
* The reciprocal of an analytic function that is nowhere zero is analytic, as is the inverse of an invertible analytic function whose derivative is nowhere zero. (See also the Lagrange inversion theorem.)
* Any analytic function is smooth, that is, infinitely differentiable. The converse is not true for real functions; in fact, in a certain sense, the real analytic functions are sparse compared to all real infinitely differentiable functions. For the complex numbers, the converse does hold, and in fact any function differentiable &quot;once&quot; on an open set is analytic on that set (see &quot;analyticity and differentiability&quot; below).
* For any open set formula_51, the set &quot;A&quot;(Ω) of all analytic functions formula_52 is a Fréchet space with respect to the uniform convergence on compact sets. The fact that uniform limits on compact sets of analytic functions are analytic is an easy consequence of Morera&#x27;s theorem. The set formula_53 of all bounded analytic functions with the supremum norm is a Banach space.

A polynomial cannot be zero at too many points unless it is the zero polynomial (more precisely, the number of zeros is at most the degree of the polynomial). A similar but weaker statement holds for analytic functions. If the set of zeros of an analytic function ƒ has an accumulation point inside its domain, then ƒ is zero everywhere on the connected component containing the accumulation point. In other words, if (&quot;rn&quot;) is a sequence of distinct numbers such that ƒ(&quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;n&quot; and this sequence converges to a point &quot;r&quot; in the domain of &quot;D&quot;, then ƒ is identically zero on the connected component of &quot;D&quot; containing &quot;r&quot;. This is known as the identity theorem.

Also, if all the derivatives of an analytic function at a point are zero, the function is constant on the corresponding connected component.

These statements imply that while analytic functions do have more degrees of freedom than polynomials, they are still quite rigid.

==Analyticity and differentiability==
As noted above, any analytic function (real or complex) is infinitely differentiable (also known as smooth, or formula_54). (Note that this differentiability is in the sense of real variables; compare complex derivatives below.) There exist smooth real functions that are not analytic: see non-analytic smooth function. In fact there are many such functions.

The situation is quite different when one considers complex analytic functions and complex derivatives. It can be proved that any complex function differentiable (in the complex sense) in an open set is analytic. Consequently, in complex analysis, the term &quot;analytic function&quot; is synonymous with &quot;holomorphic function&quot;.

==Real versus complex analytic functions==
Real and complex analytic functions have important differences (one could notice that even from their different relationship with differentiability). Analyticity of complex functions is a more restrictive property, as it has more restrictive necessary conditions and complex analytic functions have more structure than their real-line counterparts.

According to Liouville&#x27;s theorem, any bounded complex analytic function defined on the whole complex plane is constant. The corresponding statement for real analytic functions, with the complex plane replaced by the real line, is clearly false; this is illustrated by

formula_55

Also, if a complex analytic function is defined in an open ball around a point &quot;x&quot;0, its power series expansion at &quot;x&quot;0 is convergent in the whole open ball (holomorphic functions are analytic). This statement for real analytic functions (with open ball meaning an open interval of the real line rather than an open disk of the complex plane) is not true in general; the function of the example above gives an example for &quot;x&quot;0 = 0 and a ball of radius exceeding 1, since the power series diverges for |&quot;x&quot;| ≥ 1.

Any real analytic function on some open set on the real line can be extended to a complex analytic function on some open set of the complex plane. However, not every real analytic function defined on the whole real line can be extended to a complex function defined on the whole complex plane. The function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) defined in the paragraph above is a counterexample, as it is not defined for &quot;x&quot; = ±i. This explains why the Taylor series of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) diverges for |&quot;x&quot;| &gt; 1, i.e., the radius of convergence is 1 because the complexified function has a pole at distance 1 from the evaluation point 0 and no further poles within the open disc of radius 1 around the evaluation point.

==Analytic functions of several variables==
One can define analytic functions in several variables by means of power series in those variables (see power series). Analytic functions of several variables have some of the same properties as analytic functions of one variable. However, especially for complex analytic functions, new and interesting phenomena show up in 2 or more complex dimensions:

* Zero sets of complex analytic functions in more than one variable are never discrete. This can be proved by Hartogs&#x27;s extension theorem.
* Domains of holomorphy for single-valued functions consist of arbitrary (connected) open sets. In several complex variables, however, only some connected open sets are domains of holomorphy. The characterization of domains of holomorphy leads to the notion of pseudoconvexity.

<text>Sir Michael Caine (born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite; 14 March 1933) is an English retired actor. Known for his distinct Cockney accent, he has appeared in more than 160 films over a career that spanned eight decades and is considered a British cultural icon. He has received numerous awards including two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. As of 2017, the films in which Caine has appeared have grossed over $7.8 billion worldwide. Caine is one of only five male actors to be nominated for an Academy Award for acting in five different decades. In 2000, he received a BAFTA Fellowship and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

Often playing a Cockney, Caine made his breakthrough in the 1960s with starring roles in British films such as &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964), &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965), &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969), and &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969). During this time he established a distinctive visual style wearing thick horn-rimmed glasses combined with sharp suits and a laconic vocal delivery; he was recognised as a style icon of the 1960s. He solidified his stardom with roles in &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971), &quot;The Last Valley&quot; (1971), &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975), &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1976), and &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977).

Caine received two Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor for his roles as Elliot in Woody Allen&#x27;s dramedy &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), and as Dr. Wilbur Larch in Lasse Hallström&#x27;s drama &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; (1999). His other Oscar-nominated film roles were in &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972), &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (2002)—all four of which were for the leading actor category. Other notable performances occurred in the films &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978), &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; (1980), &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1986), &quot;Little Voice&quot; (1998), &quot;Quills&quot; (2000), &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006), &quot;Harry Brown&quot; (2009), and &quot;Youth&quot; (2015).

Caine is also known for his performance as Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; (1992), and for his comedic roles in &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (1988), &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000), &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002), and &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; (2003). Caine portrayed Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; trilogy (2005–2012). He has also had roles in five other Nolan films: &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), &quot;Inception&quot; (2010), &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017), and &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020). He announced his retirement from acting in October 2023, with his final film being &quot;The Great Escaper&quot;, which came out in the same month.

==Early life==

Michael Caine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite at St Olave&#x27;s Hospital in the Rotherhithe district of London on 14 March 1933, the son of cook and charwoman Ellen Frances Marie (née Burchell; 1901–1989) and a fish market porter also called Maurice Joseph Micklewhite (1899–1956). His father was from a Catholic Irish Traveller family background. Caine was raised in his mother&#x27;s Protestant faith. He had a younger brother, Stanley (1935–2013), who also became an actor, and an older maternal half-brother named David Burchell. He grew up in London&#x27;s Southwark district; during the Second World War, he was evacuated to North Runcton, Norfolk, where he made his acting debut at the village school and had a pet horse called Lottie.

After the war, Caine&#x27;s father was demobilised and the family were rehoused by the council in Marshall Gardens in London&#x27;s Elephant and Castle area, where they lived in a prefabricated house made in Canada as much of London&#x27;s housing stock had been destroyed during the Blitz in 1940 and 1941. Caine later wrote in his autobiography, &quot;The prefabs, as they were known, were intended to be temporary homes while London was reconstructed, but we ended up living there for eighteen years—and for us, after a cramped flat with an outside toilet, it was luxury.&quot;

At the age of 10, Caine acted in a school play as the father of the ugly sisters in &quot;Cinderella&quot;. His trousers&#x27; zipper was undone, prompting the audience to laugh, which inspired him to pursue an acting career. In 1944, he passed his eleven-plus examination, winning a scholarship to Hackney Downs School. After a year there, he moved to Wilson&#x27;s School in Camberwell, which he left at age 16 after gaining School Certificates in six subjects. He then worked briefly as a filing clerk and messenger for a film company in Victoria and film producer Jay Lewis on Wardour Street.

==Army service==
In 1952, Caine was called up to do his national service. Between 1952 and 1954 he served in the British Army&#x27;s Royal Fusiliers, first at the British Army of the Rhine Headquarters in Iserlohn, West Germany, and then on active service in the Korean War.

Caine, seeing first-hand how the Chinese used human wave tactics, was left with the sense that the communist government did not care about its citizens. Having been previously sympathetic towards the ideals of communism, Caine was left repelled by it. He experienced a situation in which he thought he was going to die, the memory of which stayed with him and &quot;formed his character&quot;. In his 2010 autobiography &quot;The Elephant to Hollywood&quot;, he wrote that &quot;The rest of my life I have lived every bloody moment from the moment I wake up until the time I go to sleep.&quot;

Caine has said that he would like to see the return of national service in Britain, to help combat youth violence, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m just saying, put them in the Army for six months. You&#x27;re there to learn how to defend your country. You belong to the country. Then, when you come out, you have a sense of belonging, rather than a sense of violence.&quot;

==Acting career==
=== 1950–1963: Acting debut and early roles ===
Caine&#x27;s film debut was an uncredited walk-on role in &quot;Morning Departure&quot; (1950). A few years later in Horsham, Sussex, he responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot; for an assistant stage manager who would also perform bit parts for the Horsham-based Westminster Repertory Company, who were performing at the Carfax Electric Theatre. Adopting the stage name &quot;Michael White&quot;, in July 1953 he was cast as the drunkard Hindley in the company&#x27;s production of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. He moved to the Lowestoft Repertory Company in Suffolk for a year when he was 21. It was here that he met his first wife, Patricia Haines. He has described the first nine years of his career as &quot;really, really brutal&quot; as well as &quot;more like purgatory than paradise&quot;. He appeared in nine plays during his time at the Lowestoft Rep at the Arcadia Theatre with Jackson Stanley&#x27;s Standard Players.

When his career took him to London in 1954 after his provincial apprenticeship, his agent informed him that there was already a Michael White performing as an actor in London and that he had to come up with a new name immediately. Speaking to his agent from a telephone booth in Leicester Square, London, he looked around for inspiration, noted that &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was being shown at the Odeon Cinema, and decided to change his name to &quot;Michael Caine&quot;. He joked on television in 1987 that, had a tree partly blocking his view been a few feet to the left, he might have been called &quot;Michael Mutiny&quot;. He also later joked in interviews that, had he looked the other way, he would have ended up as &quot;Michael One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;. In 1958, Caine played the minor role of a court orderly in a BBC Television adaptation of the story, &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;.

Caine moved in with another rising cockney actor, Terence Stamp, and began hanging out with him and Peter O&#x27;Toole in the London party scene after he had become O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s understudy in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s West End staging of Willis Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot; in 1959. Caine took over the role when O&#x27;Toole left to make &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and went on to a four-month tour of the UK and Ireland. Caine&#x27;s first film role was as one of the privates in George Baker&#x27;s platoon in the 1956 film &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot;. The stars of the film were Baker, Harry Andrews, Stanley Baker and Michael Medwin, with Stephen Boyd and Ronald Lewis; Robert Shaw also had a small part. Caine also appeared regularly on television in small roles. His first credited role on the BBC was in 1956, where he played Boudousse in the Jean Anouilh play &quot;The Lark&quot;. Other parts included three roles in &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; in 1957, 1958 and 1959, prisoner-of-war series &quot;Escape&quot; (1957), and the crime/thriller drama &quot;Mister Charlesworth&quot; (1958).

Caine continued to appear on television, in serials &quot;The Golden Girl&quot; and &quot;No Wreath for the General&quot;, but was then cast in the play &quot;The Compartment&quot;, written by Johnny Speight, a two-hander also starring Frank Finlay. This was followed by main roles in other plays including the character Tosh in &quot;Somewhere for the Night&quot;, a &quot;Sunday-Night Play&quot; written by Bill Naughton televised on Sunday 3 December 1961, another two-hander by Johnny Speight, &quot;The Playmates&quot;, and two editions of BBC plays strand &quot;First Night&quot;, &quot;Funny Noises with Their Mouths&quot; and &quot;The Way with Reggie&quot; (both 1963). He also acted in radio plays, including Bill Naughton&#x27;s &quot;Looking for Frankie&quot; on the BBC Home Service (1963). A big break came for Caine when he was cast as Meff in James Saunders&#x27; Cockney comedy &quot;Next Time I&#x27;ll Sing To You&quot;, when this play was presented at the New Arts Theatre in London on 23 January 1963. Scenes from the play&#x27;s performance were featured in the April 1963 issue of &quot;Theatre World&quot; magazine.

=== 1964–1975: Stardom and acclaim ===

When this play moved to the Criterion in Piccadilly with Michael Codron directing, he was visited backstage by Stanley Baker, one of the four stars in Caine&#x27;s first film, &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot;, who told him about the part of a Cockney private in his upcoming film &quot;Zulu&quot;, a film Baker was producing and starring in. Baker told Caine to meet the director, Cy Endfield, who informed him that he already had given the part to James Booth, a fellow Cockney who was Caine&#x27;s friend, because he &quot;looked more Cockney&quot; than Caine did. Endfield then told the 6&#x27;2&quot; Caine that he did not look like a Cockney but like an officer, and offered him a screen test for the role of a snobbish, upper class officer after Caine assured him that he could do a posh accent. Caine believes Endfield offered him, a Cockney, the role of an aristocrat because, being American, he did not have the endemic British class-prejudice. Though he tested poorly, Endfield gave him the part that would make him a film star.
Location shooting for &quot;Zulu&quot; took place in Natal, South Africa, for 14 weeks in 1963. According to his 2010 autobiography &quot;The Elephant to Hollywood&quot;, Caine had been signed to a seven-year contract by Joseph E. Levine, whose Embassy Films was distributing &quot;Zulu&quot;. After the return of the cast to England and the completion of the film, Levine released him from the contract, telling him, &quot;I know you&#x27;re not, but you gotta face the fact that you look like a queer on screen.&quot; Levine gave his contract to his &quot;Zulu&quot; co-star James Booth. Subsequently, Caine&#x27;s agent got him cast in the BBC production &quot;Hamlet at Elsinore&quot; (1964) as Horatio, in support of Christopher Plummer&#x27;s Hamlet. Horatio was the only classical role which Caine, who had never received dramatic training, would ever play. Caine wrote, &quot;...I decided that if my on-screen appearance was going to be an issue, then I would use it to bring out all Horatio&#x27;s ambiguous sexuality.&quot;

Caine&#x27;s roles as effete-seeming aristocrats were to contrast with his next projects, in which he was to become notable for using a regional accent, rather than the Received Pronunciation then considered proper for film actors. At that time his working-class Cockney speech stood out to American and British audiences alike, as did the Beatles&#x27; Liverpudlian accents. &quot;Zulu&quot; was followed by two of Caine&#x27;s best-known roles: the rough-edged petty-crook-turned-spy Harry Palmer in &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965) and the titular womanising young Cockney in &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966). In a 2016 interview Caine cited &quot;Alfie&quot; as his favourite film of his career, saying, &quot;it made me a star in America as well, and it was my first nomination for an Academy Award&quot;. He went on to play Harry Palmer in a further four films, &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1966), &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967), &quot;Bullet to Beijing&quot; (1995) and &quot;Midnight in Saint Petersburg&quot; (1996). Caine made his first film in Hollywood in 1966, after an invitation from Shirley MacLaine to play opposite her in &quot;Gambit&quot;. During the first two weeks, whilst staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel, he met long-term friends John Wayne and agent &quot;Swifty&quot; Lazar. Wayne was a fan of Caine&#x27;s performance in &quot;Alfie&quot; and suggested to Caine, &quot;Speak slow and speak low&quot;. Caine was always grateful for that advice. Caine starred in the film &quot;The Magus&quot; (1968) which, although BAFTA-nominated for Best Cinematography, failed at the box office.

Caine starred in the 1969 comedy caper film &quot;The Italian Job&quot; as Charlie Croker, the leader of a Cockney criminal gang released from prison with the intention of doing a &quot;big job&quot; in Italy to steal gold bullion from an armoured security truck. One of the most celebrated roles of his career, in a 2002 poll his line &quot;You&#x27;re only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!&quot; was voted the second-funniest line in film (after &quot;He&#x27;s not the Messiah, he&#x27;s a very naughty boy&quot; from Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Life of Brian&quot;), and favourite one-liner in a 2003 poll of 1,000 film fans. Culminating in a cliffhanger, &quot;The Italian Job&quot; has one of the most discussed end scenes in film; what happened to the coachload of gold teetering over the edge of a cliff has been debated in the decades since the film was released.

After working on &quot;The Italian Job&quot; with Noël Coward, and a role as RAF fighter pilot squadron leader Canfield in the all-star cast of &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (both 1969), Caine played the lead in &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971), a British gangster film. Caine also starred in a comedy thriller, &quot;Pulp&quot; (1972). Caine continued with successes including &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972) opposite Laurence Olivier, and John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975) co-starring Sean Connery, which received widespread acclaim. &quot;The Times&quot; applauded the &quot;lovely double act of Caine and Connery, clowning to their doom&quot;, while Huston paid tribute to Caine&#x27;s improvisation as an actor: &quot;Michael is one of the most intelligent men among the artists I&#x27;ve known. I don&#x27;t particularly care to throw the ball to an actor and let him improvise, but with Michael it&#x27;s different. I just let him get on with it.&quot; In 1974, Caine appeared in &quot;The Black Windmill&quot;, co-starring Donald Pleasence.

=== 1976–1997: Established star ===

In 1976, Caine appeared in Tom Mankiewicz&#x27;s screen adaptation of the Jack Higgins novel &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; as &quot;Oberst&quot; (Colonel) Kurt Steiner, the commander of a Luftwaffe paratroop unit disguised as Polish paratroopers, whose mission was to kidnap or kill the then-British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, alongside co-stars Donald Sutherland, Robert Duvall, Jenny Agutter and Donald Pleasence. Caine also was part of an all-star cast in &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977). In 1978, Caine starred in &quot;Silver Bears&quot;, an adaptation of Paul Erdman&#x27;s 1974 novel of the same name, and co-starred in the Academy Award-winning &quot;California Suite&quot;. In the late 1970s, Caine&#x27;s choice of roles was frequently criticisedsomething to which he has referred with self-deprecating comments about taking parts strictly for the money. He averaged two films a year, but these included such films as &quot;The Swarm&quot; (1978) (although critically panned it was Academy Award-nominated for Best Costume Design), &quot;Ashanti&quot; (1979) and &quot;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1979).

In the early 1980s Caine appeared in &quot;The Island&quot; (1980), &quot;The Hand&quot; (1981), and had a reunion with his &quot;Sleuth&quot; co-star Laurence Olivier in &quot;The Jigsaw Man&quot; (1982). During the 1980s Caine enjoyed further acclaimed roles and awards attention. He co-starred with Julie Walters in &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983), for which he won a BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award. In 1986, he portrayed the neurotic Elliot in Woody Allen&#x27;s ensemble comedy &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, starring Barbara Hershey, Dianne Wiest, and Mia Farrow. For his performance he won his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2011, &quot;Caine&#x27;s performance, so fervent, so agonisingly dedicated, actually gains in force and touching sincerity with the years.&quot; Caine also played a suave English conman, opposite a clumsy American played by Steve Martin, in the crime comedy &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (1988), directed by Frank Oz. The film earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination, losing to Tom Hanks in &quot;Big&quot; (1988).

Caine&#x27;s other successful films (critically or financially) were the 1980 Golden Globe-nominated slasher film &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, the 1981 war film &quot;Escape to Victory&quot; featuring Sylvester Stallone and footballers from the 1960s and 1970s, including Pelé and Bobby Moore, the 1982 film &quot;Deathtrap&quot;, and &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1986). In 1987, Caine narrated &quot;Hero&quot;, the official film of the 1986 FIFA World Cup. That year he starred in the thriller and spy film &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot; alongside Pierce Brosnan. In 1988 he played Chief Insp. Frederick Abberline in the two-part TV drama &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, which co-starred Jane Seymour and was produced to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the Jack the Ripper murder spree in Victorian London. Despite his success in the 1980s, Caine also appeared in some poorly received films such as &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot; (1984), the Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais comedy &quot;Water&quot; (1985), the fourth and final film in the &quot;Jaws&quot; franchise, &quot;&quot; (1987), and &quot;Without a Clue&quot; (1988) (portraying Sherlock Holmes). Caine&#x27;s commitment to filming &quot;Jaws: The Revenge&quot; in the Bahamas meant that he was unable to receive his Academy Award for &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; in person and Dianne Wiest accepted it on his behalf. Caine said of &quot;Jaws: The Revenge&quot;, &quot;I have never seen the film, but by all accounts it was terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.&quot;
In the 1990s, Caine found good parts harder to come by. He played the mysterious bartender Mike in &quot;Mr. Destiny&quot; in 1990 and appeared with Roger Moore in &quot;Bullseye!&quot; (1990).He played Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; (1992). Having been chosen by Brian Henson, Caine stated: &quot;I&#x27;m going to play this movie like I&#x27;m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me.&quot; He played the beleaguered stage director Lloyd Fellowes in the film adaptation of &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1992). He also played a villain in the Steven Seagal film &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; (1994). He was starred two straight to video Harry Palmer sequels and a few television films.

=== 1998–2014: Career resurgence ===

Caine&#x27;s performance in &quot;Little Voice&quot; (1998) won him a Golden Globe Award. Better parts followed, including &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; (1999), for which he won his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In the 2000s, Caine appeared in the comedy &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000) as the refined pageant coach opposite Sandra Bullock as the undercover FBI agent. The film was a massive box office success and Caine earned praise for his comic turn. That same year Caine also appeared in Philip Kaufman&#x27;s controversial yet acclaimed film &quot;Quills&quot; (2000) as Dr. Royer-Collard opposite Geoffrey Rush, Kate Winslet, and Joaquin Phoenix. In 2001, Caine starred in the ensemble dramedy &quot;Last Orders&quot; starring Helen Mirren, Bob Hoskins, and Tom Courtenay. Caine&#x27;s next film &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (2002) won him great critical acclaim with Roger Ebert writing, &quot;[it&#x27;s] a performance that seems to descend perfectly formed. There is no artifice in it, no unneeded energy, no tricks, no effort&quot;. Caine earned his sixth Academy Award nomination as well as a Golden Globe Award and British Academy Film Award for his performance.

Several of Caine&#x27;s classic films have been remade, including &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, &quot;Get Carter&quot;, &quot;Alfie&quot; and &quot;Sleuth&quot;. Caine appeared in &quot;Get Carter&quot; the 2000 American action thriller film directed by Stephen Kay; a remake of his 1971 film &quot;Get Carter&quot;, in which a younger Michael Caine played the title role. Here in the 2000 remake, Caine&#x27;s role was originally relegated to a one-scene cameo appearance, which he agreed to do as a favor to his friend Sylvester Stallone. However, after a test screening, additional scenes were scripted and shot to expand his role. The film was released in the U.S. on 6 October 2000. Critical reaction was negative, and the film flopped at the box office, with worldwide earnings of approximately only $19 million against a production budget of nearly $64 million. Stallone said: &quot;Believe it or not, I think Get Carter was really underrated. That was a big disappointment. I learned the hard way that [remakes], even if you do it better than the original, there’s a tremendous nostalgia attached to the original. And quite often they’re not done as well.&quot; In the 2007 remake of &quot;Sleuth&quot;, Caine took over the role Laurence Olivier played in the 1972 version and Jude Law played Caine&#x27;s original role. Caine is one of the few actors to have played a starring role in two versions of the same film. In an interview with CNN, Law spoke of his admiration for Caine: &quot;I learned so much just from watching how he monitored his performance, and also how little he has to do. He&#x27;s a master technician and sometimes he was doing stuff I didn&#x27;t see, I couldn&#x27;t register. I&#x27;d go back and watch it on the monitor, it was like &#x27;Oh my God, the amount of variety he&#x27;s put in there is breathtaking&quot;.

Caine also starred in multiple comedies during this time, including playing Austin&#x27;s father in &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002). In 2003 he co-starred with Robert Duvall, and Haley Joel Osment in the family comedy &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot;. Caine played family elder Henry Lair in the 2004 film &quot;Around the Bend&quot;. Also in 2005, he played as Isabel&#x27;s (Nicole Kidman) father in &quot;Bewitched&quot; alongside Will Ferrell and Shirley MacLaine. In 2005, he was cast as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s butler Alfred Pennyworth in &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, the first film in the new Batman film series known as &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy. In 2006, he appeared in Alfonso Cuaron&#x27;s acclaimed dystopian drama &quot;Children of Men&quot; alongside Clive Owen and Julianne Moore as well as Nolan&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;The Prestige&quot; starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. In 2007 he appeared in &quot;Flawless&quot;, and in 2008 and 2012 he reprised his role as Alfred in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Batman&quot; sequels &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; as well as starring in the British drama &quot;Is Anybody There?&quot;, which explores the final days of life. It was reported by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine that Caine had said that &quot;Harry Brown&quot; (released on 13 November 2009) would be his last lead role. Caine later clarified that he had no intention of retiring, stating that &quot;You don&#x27;t retire in this business; the business retires you.&quot;
Caine appeared in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s science fiction thriller &quot;Inception&quot; as Prof. Stephen Miles, Cobb&#x27;s (Leonardo DiCaprio) mentor and father-in-law. The film was a financial and critical success, earning 8 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. He voiced Finn McMissile in Pixar&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Cars 2&quot; and also voiced a supporting role in the animated film &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot;. He also starred in the 2012 film &quot;Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&quot;, as Josh Hutcherson&#x27;s character&#x27;s grandfather; the film also featured Dwayne Johnson and Vanessa Hudgens. Caine reprised his role as Alfred Pennyworth in the Batman sequel &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, which was released in July 2012. Caine later called &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy, &quot;one of the greatest things I have done in my life.&quot; In 2013, Caine appeared in the heist thriller &quot;Now You See Me&quot; starring alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Morgan Freeman. Caine played the role of Arthur Tressler, an insurance magnate and the Four Horsemen&#x27;s sponsor. The film, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, was a financial success at the box office and spawned a sequel, &quot;Now You See Me 2&quot; (2016). He appeared in Nolan&#x27;s 2014 science-fiction film &quot;Interstellar&quot; as Professor Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, ideator of Plan A, former mentor of Cooper and father of Amelia. The film starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. In 2015, Caine co-starred in Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s action spy comedy &quot;&quot; starring Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, and Samuel L. Jackson.

=== 2015–2023: Final roles and retirement ===

In May 2015, Caine starred in Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s Italian comedy-drama film &quot;Youth&quot; alongside Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano, and Jane Fonda. Caine appeared in the lead role of retired composer Fred Ballinger, where he and the film won great acclaim at its debut at the Cannes Film Festival. Caine received a London Film Critics&#x27; Circle Award for British Actor of the Year nomination for his performance. In October 2015, Caine read Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;Little Claus and Big Claus&quot; for the children&#x27;s fairytales app GivingTales in aid of UNICEF, together with Sir Roger Moore, Stephen Fry, Ewan McGregor, Dame Joan Collins, Joanna Lumley, David Walliams, Charlotte Rampling and Paul McKenna.

In 2017, Caine was cast in a spoken cameo role in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s action-thriller &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017), based on the Dunkirk evacuation of World War II, as a Royal Air Force Spitfire pilot, as a nod to his role of RAF fighter pilot Squadron Leader Canfield in &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969). In 2018, Caine starred as Brian Reader in &quot;King of Thieves&quot;, which was based on the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary of 2015.

In May 2019, Caine was cast as Sir Michael Crosby, a British Intelligence officer, in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020). The film starred John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh. The film received an American release during the COVID-19 pandemic in September 2020 after being delayed multiple times and became a box office disappointment, despite receiving positive reviews. Caine also appeared in the children&#x27;s fantasy film, &quot;Come Away&quot; (2020) starring Angelina Jolie, David Oyelowo, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to mixed reviews, with critics praising its performances and lavish production design. In the 2021 film &quot;Twist&quot;, an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; set in the present day, Caine plays Fagin. In interviews promoting the 2021 film &quot;Best Sellers&quot;, Caine suggested that he would not make another film, citing difficulty in walking and his new interest in novel-writing developed during the COVID-19 lockdowns. However, his representatives told &quot;Variety&quot; that he was not retiring from acting. In 2022, Caine filmed &quot;The Great Escaper&quot;, a British-French feature film starring Caine and Glenda Jackson, based on the true-life story of a British World War II veteran who &#x27;broke out&#x27; of his nursing home to attend the 70th anniversary D-Day commemorations in France, in June 2014. The film was released on 6 October 2023.

Caine officially confirmed his retirement from acting on 13 October 2023, mainly because of the decreasing likelihood of him getting any more leading roles. Caine announced his retirement from acting in a BBC &quot;Today&quot; radio programme interview with Martha Kearney. Referring to &quot;The Great Escaper&quot; he said, &quot;I keep saying I&#x27;m going to retire, well I am now, because I figured, I&#x27;ve had a picture which is — I played the lead and it&#x27;s got incredible reviews. The only parts I&#x27;m liable to get now are old men, 90-year-old men, and I thought well I might as well leave with all this. I&#x27;ve got wonderful reviews. What am I going to do to beat this?&quot;

==In popular culture==
Caine is regarded as a British cultural icon, with Mairi Mackay of CNN stating: &quot;Michael Caine has been personifying British cool since the swinging sixties. He has brought some of British cinema&#x27;s most iconic characters to life and introduced his very own laid-back cockney gangster into pop culture. He doggedly retained a regional accent at a time when the plummy tones of Received Pronunciation were considered obligatory. It is a sweet irony that his accent has become his calling card.&quot; In 2015 &quot;The Times&quot; called Caine &quot;the epitome of Sixties cool in his first outing as the secret agent Harry Palmer&quot;. A trailer for his second role as Palmer described him as possessing &quot;horn rims, cockney wit and an iron fist&quot;.

With his distinctive voice and manner of speaking, Caine is a popular subject for impersonators and mimics. Most Caine impressions include the catchphrase &quot;Not a lot of people know that.&quot; The catchphrase emanates from Caine&#x27;s habit of informing people of obscure &quot;interesting facts&quot; that he has collected. Referring to Caine as being the &quot;biggest mine of useless information&quot;, Peter Sellers initiated the catchphrase when he appeared on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Parkinson&quot; show on 28 October 1972 and said:

Caine later spoke of how Sellers used his impression of him as his answering machine message in the 1970s: &quot;I called Peter one day, he wasn&#x27;t in. And there was me saying, &#x27;My name is Michael Caine. I just want you to know that Peter Sellers is not in. Not many people know that.&#x27; He invented that &#x27;not many people know that.&#x27; And then everybody who rang him, they got me saying, &#x27;Not many people know that. Over the years Caine himself had parodied his catchphrase and his &quot;interesting facts&quot;, and has imitated others&#x27; impressions of him. In an interview with Michael Parkinson in 2007, Caine commented on the impersonations of his voice, &quot;I can do it. &#x27;Hello. My name is Michael Caine. Not many people know that.&#x27; I sound like a bloody moron. You know where they&#x27;ve got me now? On birthday cards. &#x27;It&#x27;s your birthday today. Not many people know that&#x27;. Now they&#x27;ve got me on Satellite navigation. It&#x27;s me going, &#x27;take the second turn on the right, and you&#x27;ll wind up right in the shit. In 1983, Caine used his &quot;not a lot of people know that&quot; phrase as a joke in the film &quot;Educating Rita&quot;.

The comedy sketch show &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Television Programme&quot; included a series of sketches in which Paul Whitehouse played a character called Michael Paine; an amalgam of previous Michael Caine impressions, who in a reference to Caine&#x27;s character Harry Palmer from &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; wears oversized, thick-rimmed glasses and a trench coat. He introduces himself with the line, &quot;My name is Michael Paine, and I am a nosy neighbour&quot; and in a spoof of the stakeout at the beginning of &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, recounts to the camera the &#x27;suspiciously&#x27; mundane behaviour of his neighbours, before saying, &quot;Not a lot of people know that I know that&quot;. Caine&#x27;s Harry Palmer character (with the glasses, the girls, and disregard for authority) was among the many British pop cultural influences for Mike Myers&#x27; &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films. At Myers&#x27; request, Caine himself starred in &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002), with his portrayal of Nigel Powers, father of Austin Powers, spoofing Harry Palmer.
A parody of Caine appears in the animated series &quot;Ugly Americans&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Dork Knight&quot;, which also parodies the film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. In the episode, Caine appears as himself, portrayed in the light of his Alfred Pennyworth interpretation, and constantly annoys the protagonists with endless anecdotes of his career.

The 2010 television series &quot;The Trip&quot;, starring Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan, featured improvised scenes in which the two leads argue over who can do the better Michael Caine impression. Among the lines they repeat in their attempts to outdo each other are, &quot;You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!&quot; and, &quot;She was only sixteen years old&quot;—from &quot;The Italian Job&quot; and &quot;Get Carter&quot;, respectively. Coogan and Brydon later did their impressions from a balcony at the Royal Albert Hall during a celebration of Caine&#x27;s work, only to be interrupted by the real Caine informing them that they were out of shape: &quot;For me, it&#x27;s a full-time job.&quot;

Craig Ferguson ran segments on his show where he parodied Caine, usually while wearing a space suit. In a 2010 interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Caine spoke of the impersonations and how everyone he meets quotes lines at him, to the point he quotes them quoting him. When asked whether he is ever tired of telling his anecdotes, Caine stated: &quot;I enjoy making people laugh. The trick is to tell them against yourself. If you praise yourself your stories aren&#x27;t funny.&quot;

In 2018, Caine starred in a British Airways pre-flight safety video, appearing with six other British celebrities, including actresses Olivia Colman and Naomie Harris. Promoting the Flying Start children&#x27;s charity partnership between BA and Comic Relief, they are featured &#x27;auditioning&#x27; in humorous sketches while also highlighting important safety messages.

==Personal life==

, Caine divides his time between residences in Chelsea Harbour and Wimbledon, London. He previously lived in Leatherhead, Surrey, in a house with a theatre which cost him £100,000 to build. He was patron to the Leatherhead Drama Festival. He has also lived in North Stoke, Oxfordshire; Clewer, Berkshire and Lowestoft, Suffolk. Caine owns an apartment at the Apogee in Miami Beach, Florida. He still keeps a small flat near where he grew up in London. Caine has published three volumes of memoirs, &quot;What&#x27;s It All About?&quot; in 1992, &quot;The Elephant to Hollywood&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: And Other Lessons in Life&quot; in 2018.

Caine was married to actress Patricia Haines from 1954 to 1958. They had a daughter, Dominique (who was named after the heroine of Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;). He dated Edina Ronay, Nancy Sinatra, Natalie Wood, Candice Bergen, Bianca Jagger, Jill St. John, Élisabeth Ercy and Françoise Pascal. Caine has been married to actress and model Shakira Baksh since 8 January 1973. They met after Caine saw her in a Maxwell House coffee commercial and a friend gave him her telephone number. He called her every day for ten days until she finally agreed to meet him. They have a daughter, Natasha Haleema. Baksh is a Muslim while Caine is a Christian. He reflected in 2009, &quot;My wife is a Muslim and she does Muslim stuff; I&#x27;m a Christian and I do Christian stuff, and no questions ever come up. The media view of Muslims is different from mine, which is very benign and peaceful&quot;.
Proud of his working-class roots, Caine has discussed the opportunities his film career gave him: &quot;I got to play football with Pelé, for God&#x27;s sake. And I danced with Bob Fosse.&quot; He also became close friends with John Lennon, stating: &quot;With John and I it was a case of bonding because we were both working class and we shared a sense of humour. We were pretending we weren&#x27;t who people thought we were.&quot; His closest friends included two James Bond actors, Sean Connery and Roger Moore.

Some time after his mother died, Caine and his younger brother, Stanley, learned they had an elder half-brother named David. He suffered from severe epilepsy and had been kept in Cane Hill Mental Hospital his entire life. Although their mother regularly visited her first son in the hospital, even her husband did not know the child existed. David died in 1992.

In July 2016, Caine changed his name by deed poll to his long-time stage name to simplify security checks at airports. Caine stated that because the security guard often recognised him but was unaware of his real name, it would waste a considerable amount of his time as he tried to prove that he and &quot;Maurice Joseph Micklewhite&quot; were the same person:

&quot;[A security guard] would say, &#x27;Hi Michael Caine,&#x27; and suddenly I&#x27;d be giving him a passport with a different name on it. I could stand there for an hour. So I changed my name.&quot;

===Music and other interests===
Caine is a fan of chill-out music, and he released a compilation CD called &quot;Cained&quot; in 2007 on the UMTV record label. He met his good friend Elton John and was discussing musical tastes, when Caine said that he had been creating chillout mix tapes as an amateur for years. Caine and Elton John had also appeared on the same episode of &quot;Parkinson&quot;, where they sang an impromptu version of the pub tune &quot;Knees Up Mother Brown&quot;. Also in music, Caine provided vocal samples for the ska-pop band Madness for their 1984 hit &quot;Michael Caine&quot;, as his daughter was a fan. He has sung in film roles as well, including &quot;Little Voice&quot; and for the 1992 musical film &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;.

Caine quit his 80-a-day smoking habit in the early 1970s after a lecture from Tony Curtis. He is a supporter of the football club, Chelsea FC. Caine is also a fan of cricket. This was alluded to by Gary Oldman, who acted with Caine in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, when he talked about Caine&#x27;s acting methods: &quot;It&#x27;s, &#x27;Take one&#x27;. He got it. &#x27;Take two&#x27;, got it. &#x27;Take three&#x27;, got it. He&#x27;s just on the money. ... He doesn&#x27;t fuck around because he wants to get back to cricket.&quot;

Trivia books written by Caine include &quot;Not Many People Know That!&quot;, &quot;And Not Many People Know This Either!&quot;, &quot;Michael Caine&#x27;s Moving Picture Show&quot;, and &quot;Not a Lot of People Know This Is 1988&quot;. Proceeds from the books went to the National Playing Fields Association, a UK charity for which Caine served as vice president, and which aims to protect and promote open spaces for sports and recreation in British cities and towns. Starting in 1976 Caine became part owner of Langan&#x27;s Brasserie and at one point had ownership in seven restaurants in the UK and United States.

==Political views==
Caine has often been outspoken about his political views, referring to himself as a &quot;left-wing Tory&quot; influenced by both his working class background and Korean War service. He left the United Kingdom for the United States in the late 1970s, citing the income tax levied on top earners by the Labour government of James Callaghan, which then stood at 83%. He lived in Beverly Hills during that time, but returned to the UK eight years later when taxes had been lowered by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher:

Following the launch of his film &quot;Harry Brown&quot; in 2009, Caine called for the reintroduction of national service in the UK to give young people &quot;a sense of belonging, rather than a sense of violence&quot;.

In 2009, Caine publicly criticised the Labour government of Gordon Brown for its new 50% income tax rate on top earners and threatened to return to the United States if his taxes were increased further. During the run up to the 2010 general election, Caine publicly endorsed the Conservative Party and appeared with then-party leader David Cameron for the launch of a civilian non-compulsory &quot;National Service&quot; for sixteen-year-olds, although Caine stated he had previously supported New Labour under the leadership of Tony Blair in 1997. In July 2014, Caine was reported to have been a celebrity investor in a tax avoidance scheme called Liberty. In November 2014, Caine described the proposed mansion tax by then Labour leader Ed Miliband as &quot;preposterous and silly&quot;.

Caine voted in favour of Brexit in the 2016 European Referendum, stating he would rather be a &quot;poor master than a rich servant&quot;. He said he was a reluctant Leaver; &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to vote for. Both are scary. To me, you&#x27;ve now got in Europe a sort of government-by-proxy of everybody, who has now got carried away. Unless there is some extremely significant changes, we should get out.&quot;

In November 2024, following the election of Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer as Prime Minister in the July of that year, Caine supported the petition on the UK Parliament petitions website that demands a new general election in the UK by sharing it on his X account.

In a 2010 Classic FM interview, Caine said that he had persuaded a doctor to deliberately give his father a fatal overdose when he was dying from liver cancer in 1955 and endorsed voluntary euthanasia.

==Awards and honours==

Caine has been nominated for an Oscar six times, winning his first Academy Award for the 1986 film &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, and his second in 1999 for &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;, in both cases as a supporting actor. His performance in &quot;Educating Rita&quot; in 1983 earned him the BAFTA and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Caine is one of only two actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every consecutive decade from the 1960s to 2000s (the other one being Jack Nicholson); Lord Olivier was also nominated for an acting Oscar in five consecutive decades (from the &#x27;30s through the &#x27;70s) as was Denzel Washington (from the &#x27;80s to the &#x27;20s). Paul Newman received acting Oscar nominations at least once per each of five distinct decades (from the 1950s to the 2000s)—albeit not consecutively, having been overlooked throughout the &#x27;70s. Caine appeared in seven films that were ranked in the BFI&#x27;s 100 greatest British films of the 20th century.

Caine was appointed as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and in the 2000 Birthday Honours he was knighted (as &quot;Sir Maurice Micklewhite, CBE&quot;) by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for his contribution to cinema. In a tribute to his background, he stated: &quot;I was named after my father and I was knighted in his name because I love my father. I always kept my real name—I&#x27;m a very private and family-orientated person.&quot; In 2000 he received a BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award.

In 2008, Caine was awarded the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Showbusiness at the Variety Club Awards. On 5 January 2011 he was honored as Commander of the by France&#x27;s culture minister, Frédéric Mitterrand.

==Bibliography==
===Memoirs===
Caine has written four memoirs across several decades. He published the first, &quot;What&#x27;s It All About?&quot;, in 1992. Its title is a quote from the title song from his 1966 hit film &quot;Alfie&quot;. The book was reviewed negatively in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which called it an &quot;archetypal show-business memoir&quot; that was engaging but tainted by the book&#x27;s &quot;name-dropping, the sexual boasting, the sensitivity to slights&quot;. His second memoir, &quot;The Elephant to Hollywood&quot;, was published in 2010. Its title refers to his journey from working-class roots in the Elephant and Castle neighborhood of London to Hollywood success. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed it positively, calling Caine a &quot;charming raconteur&quot; and &quot;wittily self-deprecating&quot;. His third memoir, &quot;Blowing the Bloody Doors Off&quot;, was published in 2018. Its title references an iconic quote from his 1969 hit film &quot;The Italian Job&quot;. His fourth memoir, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back, You&#x27;ll Trip Over: My Guide to Life&quot;, was published in 2024.

<doc id="61480" wikidata="Q1619460" url="?curid=61480" title="Broadway Melody of 1936">
<text>Broadway Melody of 1936 is a musical film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1935. In New York, the film opened at the Capitol Theatre, the site of many prestigious MGM premieres. It was a follow-up of sorts to the successful &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;, which had been released in 1929, although, there is no story connection with the earlier film beyond the title and some music.

The film was written by Harry W. Conn, Moss Hart, Jack McGowan and Sid Silvers. It was directed by Roy Del Ruth and starred Jack Benny, Eleanor Powell, Robert Taylor, June Knight, Frances Langford, Sid Silvers, Buddy Ebsen and Vilma Ebsen (in their film debut). It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Plot==
Irene Foster (Eleanor Powell) tries to convince her high school sweetheart, Broadway producer Robert Gordon (Robert Taylor), to give her a chance to star in his new musical, but he is too busy with the rich widow (June Knight) backing his show. Irene tries to show Gordon that she has the talent to succeed, but he will not hire her. Things become complicated when she begins impersonating a French dancer, who was actually the invention of a gossip columnist (Jack Benny, parodying Walter Winchell).

==Cast==
* Jack Benny as Bert Keeler
* Eleanor Powell as Irene Foster
* Robert Taylor as Robert Gordon
* Una Merkel as Kitty Corbett
* Sid Silvers as Snoop Blue
* Buddy Ebsen as Ted Burke
* June Knight as Lillian Brent
* Vilma Ebsen as Sally Burke
* Nick Long, Jr. as Basil Newcombe
* Robert John Wildhack as Hornblow (credited as Robert Wildhack)
* Paul Harvey as Scully
* Frances Langford as herself
* Harry Stockwell as himself

;Cast notes
This was Powell&#x27;s first leading role, and her first film for MGM. She would appear in the next two entries in the Broadway Melody series: &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot; and &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot;. (These films were not related to each other in terms of storyline.) This also marked Ebsen&#x27;s film debut. Though she was dubbed in this film by Marjorie Lane, Eleanor recorded &quot;You Are My Lucky Star&quot; with Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra (Victor 25158).

Don Wilson, Jack Benny&#x27;s regular announcer on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, is not credited in &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot;, but his presence in the movie is evident at the beginning where he is the radio show host.

<doc id="61481" wikidata="Q1425815" url="?curid=61481" title="Captain Blood (1935 film)">
<text>Captain Blood is a 1935 American black-and-white swashbuckling pirate film from First National Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures, produced by Harry Joe Brown and Gordon Hollingshead (with Hal B. Wallis as executive producer), directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, and Ross Alexander.

With a screenplay by Casey Robinson, the film is based on the 1922 novel &quot;Captain Blood&quot; by Rafael Sabatini and concerns an imprisoned doctor and his fellow prisoners who escape their cruel island captivity to become West Indies pirates. An earlier 1924 Vitagraph silent film version of &quot;Captain Blood&quot; starred J. Warren Kerrigan as Peter Blood.

Warner Bros. risked pairing two relatively unknown performers in the lead roles. Flynn&#x27;s performance made him a major Hollywood star and established him as the natural successor to Douglas Fairbanks and a &quot;symbol of an unvanquished man&quot; during the Great Depression. &quot;Captain Blood&quot; also established de Havilland, in just her fourth screen appearance, as a major star and was the first of eight films costarring Flynn and de Havilland. In 1962, Flynn&#x27;s son Sean starred in &quot;The Son of Captain Blood&quot;.

==Plot==
In England in 1685, Irish doctor Peter Blood is summoned to aid Lord Gildoy, a wounded patron who participated in the Monmouth Rebellion. Arrested while performing his duties as a physician, he is convicted of treason against King James II and sentenced to death by the infamous Judge Jeffreys. By the whim of the king, upon his advisor Lord Sunderland&#x27;s counsel, Blood and the surviving rebels are transported to the West Indies to be sold into slavery.

In Port Royal, Blood is bought by Arabella Bishop, the beautiful niece of local military commander Colonel Bishop. Attracted by Blood&#x27;s rebellious nature, Arabella tries to improve his situation by recommending him as the physician to the colony&#x27;s governor, Steed, who continually suffers from painful gout. Outwardly resentful toward Arabella, yet silently appreciative for her efforts on his behalf, Blood develops an escape plan for himself and his fellow prisoners. The plan is almost uncovered by the suspicious Colonel Bishop, who has one of Blood&#x27;s men, Jeremy Pitt, flogged and interrogated. Blood is spared a similar fate when a Spanish man-o&#x27;-war attacks Port Royal. During the raid, Blood and his fellow prisoners seize the Spanish ship from its drunken night watch and sail away to begin lives of piracy in 1687.

Captain Blood&#x27;s crew quickly achieve great fame among the buccaneers of the Brotherhood of the Coast, with Blood himself deemed the greatest captain of the coast. When Governor Steed is unable to contain the pirate menace, Colonel Bishop is appointed governor. He sends Arabella to England on an extended holiday, but three years later, she returns to the Caribbean. Her ship, also carrying royal emissary Lord Willoughby, is captured by Blood&#x27;s treacherous partner, the French buccaneer Captain Levasseur, who plans to hold them for ransom. Blood forces Levasseur to sell them to him, relishing the opportunity to turn the tables on Arabella. When Levasseur vehemently objects, despite having accepted Blood&#x27;s payment, the two pirate captains duel, with Blood killing Levasseur. Blood offers Arabella valuable jewelry from his conquests as a sign of his love for her. Ungrateful for her &quot;rescue,&quot; Arabella is indignant at having been purchased by Blood and calls him a thief and a pirate. Although angered by her rejection, he orders his men to set sail for Port Royal, where he will deliver Arabella and Lord Willoughby, despite the danger to himself and his crew.

As they approach Port Royal, they sight two French warships attacking the city; Bishop has left it undefended in his single-minded pursuit of Blood. With England now at war with France, Lord Willoughby pleads with Blood to save the colony, but the captain and his crew refuse to fight for the corrupt king. Willoughby reveals that James was kicked out of England and fled to France and is in hiding; England&#x27;s new king, William III, has sent Willoughby to offer Blood and his men full pardons and commissions in the Royal Navy. This startling news quickly changes the pirates&#x27; minds, and they prepare for battle with the French.

After having had Arabella ferried ashore, Blood and his men approach Port Royal flying French colors, but soon that ensign is replaced with the British Union Jack. A pitched ship-to-ship battle ensues, leading to frenzied hand-to-hand deck combat. Blood and his men defeat the French frigates, saving the colony, but not before losing their ship in the battle. As a reward for his daring action, Blood is appointed the new governor of Port Royal by Lord Willoughby, after which Arabella confesses that she loves him. Blood also has the pleasure of dealing with his hostile predecessor, having now returned from his pirate hunt and under arrest for abandoning his post in a time of war. As Arabella playfully pleads with the new governor to spare her uncle&#x27;s life, Blood finally reveals his face to the astonished Bishop, greeting him with the phrase &quot;Good morning, Uncle&quot;.

==Cast==

==Production==
Warner Bros. was inspired to remake the film, which it had first produced as a silent picture in 1923, after the popularity of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1934) revived the Hollywood swashbuckler genre.

Some of the film&#x27;s sea-battle footage was taken from the silent film &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1924).

===Music score===
&quot;Captain Blood&quot; features a stirring and romantic musical score, the first of its type for a sound film, by Austrian composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold. In 1935, Warner Bros. asked Korngold to score the film, but he declined, feeling that a story about pirates was outside his range of interest. However, Korngold changed his mind after watching the filming.

Korngold was required to compose more than an hour of symphonic music in only three weeks. The short time frame forced him to borrow portions of symphonic poems by Franz Liszt, which constituted approximately ten percent of the score. As such, Korngold was unwilling to take credit for the entire film score, insisting instead that his credit be for &quot;musical arrangement&quot; only.

&quot;Captain Blood&quot; became an immediate hit, with an Oscar nomination for the score. As Korngold&#x27;s first fully symphonic film score, it marked a milestone in his career, as he became the first composer of international stature to sign a contract with a film studio. It also launched Flynn&#x27;s film career and gave a major boost to that of de Havilland, who would appear in another seven features with Flynn. Korngold would score six more starring Flynn. The film also opened the way for other costumed, romantic film adventures, which had not been seen since the silent era.

===Budget===
The film&#x27;s production budget was .

===Casting===
The lead role was originally offered to Robert Donat, who had starred in the successful 1934 film &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. The asthmatic Donat turned down the role, concerned that the action sequences would be too strenuous for him. A series of screen tests with various actors led to Flynn, an unknown Australian actor. In January 1935, Warner Bros. signed Flynn and brought him to Hollywood after seeing him in the British B picture &quot;Murder at Monte Carlo&quot;. For the female lead role, Jean Muir was originally chosen to play opposite Donat, but after Muir declined the role, the studio focused on the 19-year-old de Havilland, who had starred in three previous films that same year, including &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; for director Max Reinhardt.

===Filming locations===
Most of the film was shot on a sound stage in the summer of 1935. Some exterior scenes, such as the sword fight between Rathbone and Flynn on a Caribbean shore, were shot at Laguna Beach, California. The final battle sequence between Blood&#x27;s pirate crew and the French ships employed one of the largest technical crews assembled for a film, requiring 2,500 extras.

During filming, Flynn collapsed from a bout of malaria that he had contracted in New Guinea.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a box-office success, earning Warner Bros. a profit of $1.462 million. According to Warner Bros., it earned $1,357,000 domestically and $1,733,000 overseas.

===Critical response===
&quot;Captain Blood&quot; premiered on December 26, 1935 at the Mark Strand Theatre in New York City and was released in the United States on December 28, 1935. The film received positive reviews and notices and wide public approval. However, &quot;Variety&#x27;s&quot; review cited weaknesses in the storyline:

Despite also finding flaws in the &quot;scripting&quot; of &quot;Captain Blood&quot; and in the presentation of some battle sequences, &quot;Variety&quot; called Flynn&#x27;s performance &quot;impressive&quot; and predicted that his work in the film would provide him with &quot;future big marquee values.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene offered a tepid review, describing the film as his favorite of those that he had reviewed that week but describing it as &quot;a fine spirited mix-up&quot; and noting the &quot;magnificently wrong characterization&quot; of King James. Greene also wrote that much of the film included anachronistic details related to clothing and setting.

&quot;Filmink&quot; magazine later wrote: &quot;Flynn was lucky – not just in being at the right place at the right time with the right lack of competition, but with his collaborators on Captain Blood.&quot;

===Awards and honors===
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and, despite not being nominated, Michael Curtiz received the second-highest number of votes for Best Director as a write-in candidate. Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Casey Robinson, also unnominated, received substantially more write-in votes than did most of the official nominees.

The film was also nominated in the categories Music (Scoring), Sound Recording (Nathan Levinson) and Writing (Screenplay).

&quot;Captain Blood&quot; has been recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Peter Blood – Nominated Hero
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

===Cultural references===
A clip of the film was used in the 1985 film &quot;The Goonies&quot;.

==Radio adaptation==
&quot;Captain Blood&quot; was adapted as a radio play on the February 22, 1937 broadcast of Lux Radio Theater with Flynn, de Havilland and Rathbone reprising their film parts. The radio version is included among the special features of the 2005 DVD version.

<doc id="61483" wikidata="Q463869" url="?curid=61483" title="The Informer (1935 film)">
<text>The Informer is a 1935 American drama thriller film directed and produced by John Ford, adapted by Dudley Nichols from the 1925 novel of the same title by Irish novelist Liam O&#x27;Flaherty. Set in 1922, the plot concerns the underside of the Irish War of Independence and centers on a disgraced Republican man, played by Victor McLaglen, who anonymously informs on his former comrades and spirals into guilt as his treachery becomes known. Heather Angel, Preston Foster, Margot Grahame, Wallace Ford, Una O&#x27;Connor and J. M. Kerrigan co-star. The novel had previously been adapted for a British film of the same name in 1929.

Along with &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, &quot;The Informer&quot; was a big contender at the 8th Academy Awards, competing directly in all six categories they were nominated for (though &quot;Mutiny&quot; got eight nominations in total, given its three Best Actor nominations). &quot;The Informer&quot; won four Oscars: Best Director for Ford, Best Actor for McLaglen, Best Writing Screenplay for Nichols, and Best Score for Max Steiner.

In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
In Dublin in 1922, Gypo Nolan has been kicked out of the outlaw Irish Republican Army (IRA) for not killing a Black and Tan who killed an IRA man. He becomes angry when he sees his streetwalker girlfriend Katie Madden trying to pick up a customer. After he throws the man into the street, Katie laments that she does not have £10 for passage to America to start afresh.

Gypo later runs into his friend and IRA comrade Frankie McPhillip, a fugitive with a £20 bounty on his head. Frankie, tired of hiding for six months, is on his way home to visit his mother and sister Mary under cover of the foggy night. The slow-witted Gypo decides to turn informer for the £20 reward, enough for passage to America for the both of them. The Black and Tans find Frankie at his house, and Frankie is killed in the ensuing gunfight. The British contemptuously give Gypo his blood money and let him go.

Gypo subsequently buys a bottle of whiskey and tells Katie that he obtained money by beating up an American sailor. He goes to Frankie&#x27;s wake, and acts suspiciously when coins fall out of his pocket. The men there tell him that they do not suspect Gypo of informing, but he then meets with several of his former IRA comrades, who wonder who informed on Frankie. Gypo claims it was a man named Mulligan. Though Gypo is drunk and talking nonsense, the others begin to suspect him but do not have enough evidence as yet. Gypo leaves and gives out £1 notes to a blind man and some bar patrons, but people wonder why he had such a sudden influx of cash. Meanwhile, Mary tells the IRA that the only person Frankie talked to that day was Gypo, and the men decide to hold an inquest into the death.

Gypo goes to an upper-class party to look for Katie, but gets drunk and buys rounds of drinks. Gypo is then taken away by his former IRA comrades when they figure out he was likely the informant. He is taken to a kangaroo court, where Mulligan is questioned and is accused once again by Gypo. However, the comrades do not believe Gypo, and give him a detailed accounting of where he spent his entire £20 reward. Gypo then confesses to ratting out Frankie.

Gypo is locked up, but before he can be killed, he escapes through a hole in the ceiling. He runs to Katie&#x27;s apartment, where he tells her that he informed on Frankie. Katie goes to see the commissioner who presided over the trial, Dan Gallagher, to beg him to leave Gypo alone. The rigid Gallagher says he cannot do anything, and Gypo might turn in the entire organization to the police if he is allowed to live. Other IRA members, having overheard Katie, go to her apartment and shoot Gypo, much to Katie&#x27;s horror as she hears the shots. Gypo wanders into a church where Frankie&#x27;s mother is praying and begs forgiveness as he confesses to her. She does forgive him, telling him that he did not know what he was doing, and the absolved Gypo dies content on the floor of the church after calling out to Frankie with joy.

==Political context and censorship==
The film did not mention the IRA by name and, like Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947), only &quot;casually touched on the underlying conflict.&quot; Writing in &quot;The IRA in Film and Television: A History,&quot; author Mark Connelly observes that both films share a common &quot;jaundiced view of Irish nationalism and its adherents.&quot; The IRA was portrayed as little more than a criminal gang &quot;whose principal activities were robbery, murder and vigilante reprisals.&quot; Gypo Nolan was largely unmotivated by ideology, instead wishing to rejoin the &quot;Organization&quot; to regain &quot;security, status, and a sense of belonging.&quot; Instead, the films used the backdrop of The Troubles for morality tales designed to appeal to the broadest possible audience. 

Politics and the cause of Irish nationalism was avoided to &quot;circumvent controversy and pass the censors&quot; in both the U.S. and Great Britain. With an eye toward distribution of the film in Britain, Joseph Breen of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, submitted the script of &quot;The Informer&quot; to the British Board of Film Censors, which requested numerous changes to omit references to the Anglo-Irish conflict.

&quot;Odd Man Out&quot; and &quot;The Informer&quot; are also similar in being &quot;dramatic portrayals of lapsed Catholics rediscovering their lost faith,&quot; and &quot;end with their dying protagonists assuming Christ-like poses.&quot;

==Reception==

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1935, Graham Greene praised the film as &quot;a memorable picture&quot; the substance of which made &quot;superb material for the screen&quot;. Greene singled out the acting of Victor McLaglen for specific praise, noting that he had &quot;never given an abler performance&quot;.

The film was popular at the box office, earning a profit of $325,000 and remains one of John Ford&#x27;s most widely referenced films.

==Awards and nominations==

===Academy Awards – 1935===
The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, winning four. McLaglen won Best Actor for his portrayal of Gypo Nolan, beating out Charles Laughton, Clark Gable, and Franchot Tone for the better-remembered &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, and Ford won Best Director. Dudley Nichols won Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, but turned it down because of union disagreements. It was the first time an Oscar was declined, though he claimed it three years later. The film also won the Oscar for Best Score; Max Steiner won for the first time. The film was nominated for Outstanding Production, as well as for Best Film Editing.

Other awards and nominations:
* National Board of Review—Best Picture
* New York Film Critics Circle Awards—Best Film and Best Director
* Venice Film Festival—John Ford nominated for the Mussolini Cup

==Reputation==

Circa 1950, &quot;The Informer&quot; graced many lists of the top films ever made, and many critics at the time considered it the greatest American sound film. The movie&#x27;s reputation as one of the all-time greats has declined considerably since then.

==Adaptations in other media==
&quot;The Informer&quot; was adapted as a radio play on the July 10, 1944, and October 17, 1950, episodes of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, the March 28, 1948, episode of the &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;. On the Academy Award Theater&#x27;s May 25, 1946, episode, McLaglen reprised his role.

<doc id="61484" wikidata="Q139258" url="?curid=61484" title="The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (film)">
<text>The Lives of a Bengal Lancer is a 1935 American adventure film starring Gary Cooper, directed by Henry Hathaway, and written by Grover Jones, William Slavens McNutt, Waldemar Young, John L. Balderston, and Achmed Abdullah. The setting and title come from the 1930 autobiography of the British soldier Francis Yeats-Brown.

The story, which has little in common with Yeats-Brown’s book, tells of a group of British cavalrymen and high-ranking officers desperately trying to defend their stronghold and headquarters at Bengal against the rebellious natives during the days of the British Raj. Cooper plays Lieutenant Alan McGregor, Franchot Tone, Lieutenant John Forsythe, Richard Cromwell, Lieutenant Donald Stone, Guy Standing, Colonel Tom Stone, and Douglass Dumbrille plays the rebel leader Mohammed Khan, who speaks the now often-misquoted line &quot;We have ways to make men talk.&quot;

The film was produced and released by Paramount Pictures. Planning began in 1931, and Paramount had expected the film to be released that same year. However, most of the location footage deteriorated due to the high temperatures, and the project was delayed. It was eventually released in the US in 1935.

It met with positive reviews and good box office results, and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning Assistant Director, with other nominations including Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture. The film grossed $1.5 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.

==Plot==
On the northwest frontier of India during the British Raj, Scottish Canadian Lieutenant Alan McGregor, in charge of newcomers, welcomes two replacements to the 41st Bengal Lancers: Lieutenant John Forsythe and Lieutenant Donald Stone, the son of the unit&#x27;s commander, Colonel Tom Stone. Lieutenant Stone, a &quot;cub&quot; (meaning a newly commissioned officer), eagerly anticipated serving on the Indian frontier, particularly because he specifically was requested and assumed that his father sent for him; Lieutenant Forsythe, an experienced cavalrymen and something of a teasing character, was sent out as a replacement for an officer who was killed in action.

After his arrival Lieutenant Stone discovers that his father keeps him at arms length, wanting to treat him the same as he treats all of the other men. He also reveals that he did &quot;not&quot; request his son serve in his regiment, a discovery that breaks his heart and leads to him going on a drunken bender. Attempting to show impartiality, the colonel treats his son indifferently. The Colonel&#x27;s commitment to strictly military behavior and adherence to protocol is interpreted by young Stone as rejection. He had not seen his father since he was a boy and had looked forward to spending time with him.

Lieutenant Barrett, disguised as a native rebel in order to spy on Mohammed Khan, reports that Khan is preparing an uprising against the British. He plans to intercept and hijack a military convoy transporting two million rounds of ammunition. When Khan discovers that Colonel Stone knows of his plan, he orders Tania Volkanskaya, a beautiful Russian agent, to seduce and kidnap Lieutenant Stone in an attempt to extract classified information about the ammunition caravan from him, or use him as leverage to attract his father. When the colonel refuses to attempt his son&#x27;s rescue, McGregor and Forsythe, appalled by the seeming lack of concern the colonel has for his own son, leave the camp at night without orders. Disguised as native merchants trying to sell blankets, they successfully get inside Khan&#x27;s fortress. However, they are recognized by Tania, who had met the two men at a social event. McGregor and Forsythe are taken prisoner.

During interrogation, Khan wants to know when and where the munitions will be transported so that he can attack and steal the arms. He has the prisoners tortured for the information. Bamboo shoots are shoved under their fingernails and set on fire. McGregor and Forsythe refuse to talk, but the demoralized Stone, feeling rejected by his father, cracks and reveals what he knows. As a result, the ammunition convoy is captured.

After receiving news of the stolen ammunition, Colonel Stone takes the 41st to battle Khan. From their cell, the captives see the overmatched Bengal Lancers deploy to assault Khan&#x27;s fortress. They manage to escape and blow up the ammunition tower, McGregor manning a machine gun and dying in the assault. Young Stone redeems himself by killing Khan with a dagger. With their ammunition gone, their leader dead, and their fortress in ruins, the remaining rebels surrender.

In recognition of their bravery and valor in battle, Lieutenants Forsythe and Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order. McGregor posthumously receives the Victoria Cross, Great Britain&#x27;s highest award for military valor, with Colonel Stone pinning the medal to the saddle cloth of McGregor&#x27;s horse in the custom in the 41st Lancers.

==Cast==
* Gary Cooper as Lieutenant Alan McGregor, a highly experienced officer in his mid-thirties, who has spent a long time with the regiment. McGregor, a Canadian, is portrayed as a charming, open character who befriends most officers, but because of disregard for his superiors and habit of speaking his mind is regarded askance by his superiors, who nevertheless respect his military abilities.
* Franchot Tone as Lieutenant John Forsythe, an upper-class cavalryman in his mid-twenties from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Transferred from the Blues, one of the two regiments at the time the movie was made tasked with guarding the Sovereign, Forsythe is presented as the funny guy of the main characters, and is noteworthy for his Sandhurst style in military exercise, something that earns him countless compliments from his superiors.

* Richard Cromwell as Lieutenant Donald Stone, a recent graduate of Sandhurst and a &quot;very&quot; young officer. As the son of a colonel with a famous name, he is treated respectfully but becomes frustrated and morose because of personal issues with his father.
* Guy Standing as Colonel Tom Stone, a long-serving colonel who left his home in Britain to serve on the Frontier, and explains to his son in the film that the &quot;service always comes first ... something your mother never understood.&quot; He is considered to be a dyed-in-the-wool, by-the-book colonel who suppresses his feelings and never does anything without orders.
* C. Aubrey Smith as Major Hamilton, an old, very experienced major who serves as Colonel Stone&#x27;s adjutant and Lieutenant Stone&#x27;s second father and friend. He, along with his chief, planned and coordinated the big assault on Mohammad Khan&#x27;s fortress.
* Kathleen Burke as Tania Volkanskaya, a beautiful and seductive young Russian woman who is Khan&#x27;s ally. She is used as Khan&#x27;s secret ace, who seduces young men when needed to forward Khan&#x27;s plans. It was she who, with considerable ease, outwitted first Stone and then McGregor and Forsythe.
* Douglass Dumbrille as Mohammed Khan, a well-known, wealthy prince of the region, educated at Oxford and ostensibly a friend of the British. He is also the secret rebel leader who fights for Bengal&#x27;s independence from the British Crown. He is portrayed as the film&#x27;s villain and is responsible for the death and torture of many people.
* Colin Tapley as Lieutenant Barrett, a close friend of Lieutenant McGregor who has been ordered to infiltrate Khan&#x27;s group of bandits and delivers vital information about the rebels&#x27; location and movement.
* Lumsden Hare as Major General Woodley, the man in command of the British intelligence service in India. He is disliked by most of the regiment&#x27;s officers, especially McGregor, because his orders usually involve training exercises in locations where the pig-sticking is good. He thought of and approved the attack on Khan&#x27;s stronghold.
* James Dime

==Production==
===Stock crisis===
Paramount originally planned to produce the film in 1931 and sent cinematographers Ernest B. Schoedsack and Rex Wimpy to India to film location shots such as a tiger hunt. However, much of the film stock deteriorated in the hot sun while on location, so when the film was eventually made, much of the production took place in the hills surrounding Los Angeles, where Northern Paiute people were used as extras.

According to Hathaway, Schoedack struggled with the studio so was replaced by Stephen Roberts, who began spending more money than Paramount were willing to, so he was fired. Gary Cooper had director approval and he suggested Henry Hathaway, whose Westerns the actor admired – it was Hathaway&#x27;s entry into big budget films. The director had been to India for nine months and remembered everything being white so insisted on that in the film.

===Filming===
Among the filming locations were Lone Pine, Calif., Buffalo Flats in Malibu, Calif., the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, Calif., and the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif. For the climactic half-hour battle sequence at the end of the film, an elaborate set was built in the Iverson Gorge, part of the Iverson Movie Ranch, to depict Mogala, the mountain stronghold of Mohammed Khan.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film was released in American cinemas in January 1935. It was a big success at the box office and kicked off a cycle of Imperial adventure tales, including &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936), &quot;Another Dawn&quot; (1937), &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939), &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Real Glory&quot; (1939). The film had theatrical rentals of about $1 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $1.5 million worldwide. It was the second most popular film at the British box office in 1935–36. The film was successful enough that it led to Gary Cooper being booked to star in a number of films of similar plots that were also set in &quot;exotic&quot; locales, including &quot;Beau Geste&quot;, &quot;The Real Glory&quot;, &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; and &quot;Distant Drums&quot;.

===Critical reception and influence===
Laura Elston from the magazine &quot;Canada&quot; wrote that &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot; did &quot;more glory to the British traditions than the British would dare to do for themselves.&quot; In response to the film success, Frederick Herron of the Motion Picture Association of America wrote &quot;Hollywood is doing a very good work in selling the British Empire to the world.&quot;

Writer John Howard Reid noted in his book &quot;Award-Winning Films of the 1930s&quot; that the film is considered &quot;one of the greatest adventure films of all time&quot; and highly praised Hathaway&#x27;s work by saying &quot;the film really made his reputation.&quot; It also received a praised review in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine, starting off the review with the words &quot;You will be immensely pleased with &quot;The Lives of a Bengal lancer&quot;&quot; and went on to compare the style and class of the three main characters to that of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. The film holds an overall approval rating of 100% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews, with a rating average of 8 out of 10.

Critic Otis Ferguson said he was &quot;taken by the show, imperialism and all.&quot; Andre Sennwald of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film &quot;glorified the British Empire better than any film produced in Britain for that purpose.&quot; Sennwald added that Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Kiplingesque&quot; movie &quot;ought to prove a blessing to Downing Street.&quot; The film proved so popular in the United States that it spurred a series of imperial films that continued throughout the decade and into the next decade. Frank S. Nugent, also of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;England need have no fears for its empire so long as Hollywood insists upon being the Kipling of the Pacific.&quot; Nugent commented that movies such as &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot; and &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; were far more pro-British than actual British filmmakers would ever dare to be: &quot;In its veneration of British colonial policy, in its respect for the omniscience and high moral purpose of His, or Her, Majesty&#x27;s diplomatic representatives and in its adulation of the courage, the virtue and the manly beauty of English soldiery abroad, Hollywood yields to no one—not even to the British filmmakers themselves.&quot;

In Fascist Italy, Mussolini&#x27;s motion picture bureau had the movie banned, as well as several other British-themed American movies, including &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s of London&quot; and &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, on the grounds that they were &quot;propaganda&quot;.

According to Ivone Kirkpatrick, who met Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden in 1937, one of Hitler&#x27;s favorite films was &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot;, which he had watched three times. He liked the film because &quot;it depicted a handful of Britons holding a continent in thrall. That was how a superior race must behave and the film was a compulsory viewing for the S.S.&quot;
Also, his valet recalled that Hitler enjoyed the film.
It was one of the eleven US movies that, from 1933 to 1937, were considered &quot;artistically valuable&quot; by the Nazi authorities.

===Plot discrepancies===
The film shares nothing with the source book, except the setting. Reid noted in &quot;Award-Winning Films of the 1930s&quot; that &quot;none of the characters in the book appear in the screenplay, not even Yeats-Brown himself. The plot of the film is also entirely different.&quot;

==Home media==
The Paramount picture was distributed to home media on VHS on March 1, 1992, and on DVD on May 31, 2005. It has since been released in multiple languages and is included in several multi-film collections.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for the following Academy Awards, winning in one category:

<doc id="61487" wikidata="Q10179" url="?curid=61487" title="Zulu language">
<text>Zulu ( ), or isiZulu as an endonym, is a Southern Bantu language of the Nguni branch spoken in, and indigenous to, Southern Africa. It is the language of the Zulu people, with about 13.56 million native speakers, who primarily inhabit the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The word &quot;KwaZulu-Natal&quot; translates into English as &quot;Home of the Zulu Nation is Natal&quot;. Zulu is the most widely spoken home language in South Africa (24% of the population), and it is understood by over 50% of its population. It became one of South Africa&#x27;s 12 official languages in 1994.

According to Ethnologue, it is the second-most widely spoken of the Bantu languages, after Swahili. Like many other Bantu languages, it is written with the Latin alphabet.

In South African English, the language is often referred to in its native form, &quot;isiZulu&quot;.

== Geographical distribution ==
Zulu migrant populations have taken it to adjacent regions, especially Zimbabwe, where the Northern Ndebele language (isiNdebele) is closely related to Zulu.

Xhosa, the predominant language in the Eastern Cape, is often considered mutually intelligible with Zulu, as is Northern Ndebele.

Maho (2009) lists four dialects: central KwaZulu-Natal Zulu, northern Transvaal Zulu, eastern coastal Qwabe, and western coastal Cele.

==History==
Like Xhosa and other Nguni people, The Zulu have lived in South Africa for hundreds of years. The Zulu language possesses several click sounds typical of Southern African languages, which are not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have coexisted with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi.

Zulu, like most indigenous Southern African languages, was not a written language until the arrival of European missionaries, who documented the language using the Latin script. The first grammar book of the Zulu language was published in Norway in 1850 by the Norwegian missionary Hans Schreuder. The first written document in Zulu was a Bible translation that appeared in 1883. In 1901, John Dube (1871–1946), a Zulu from Natal, created the Ohlange Institute, the first native educational institution in South Africa. He was also the author of &quot;Insila kaShaka&quot;, the first novel written in Zulu (1930). Another pioneering Zulu writer was Reginald Dhlomo, author of several historical novels of the 19th-century leaders of the Zulu nation: &quot;U-Dingane&quot; (1936), &quot;U-Shaka&quot; (1937), &quot;U-Mpande&quot; (1938), &quot;U-Cetshwayo&quot; (1952) and &quot;U-Dinizulu&quot; (1968). Other notable contributors to Zulu literature include Benedict Wallet Vilakazi and, more recently, Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali.

The written form of Zulu was controlled by the Zulu Language Board of KwaZulu-Natal. This board has now been disbanded and superseded by the Pan South African Language Board which promotes the use of all eleven official languages of South Africa.

==Contemporary usage==
English, Dutch ( later Afrikaans ) had been the only official languages used by all South African governments before 1994. However, in the Kwazulu bantustan, the Zulu language was widely used. All education in the country at the high school level was in English or Afrikaans. Since the fall of apartheid in 1994, Zulu has been enjoying a marked revival. Zulu-language television was introduced by the SABC in the early 1980s and it broadcasts news and many shows in Zulu. Zulu radio is very popular and newspapers such as &quot;isoLezwe&quot;, &quot;Ilanga&quot; and &quot;UmAfrika&quot; in the Zulu language are available in Kwazulu-Natal province and Johannesburg. In January 2005 the first full-length feature film in Zulu, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, was nominated for an Oscar.

In the 1994 film &quot;The Lion King&quot;, in the &quot;Circle of Life&quot; song, the phrases &quot;Ingonyama nengw&#x27; enamabala&quot; (English: &quot;A lion and a leopard spots&quot;), &quot;Nans&#x27; ingonyama bakithi Baba&quot; (English: &quot;Here comes a lion, Father&quot;) and &quot;Siyonqoba&quot; (English: &quot;We will conquer&quot;) was used. In some movie songs, like &quot;This Land&quot;, the voice says &quot;Busa leli zwe bo&quot; (&quot;Rule this land&quot;) and &quot;Busa ngothando bo&quot; (&quot;Rule with love&quot;) were used too.

The song &quot;Siyahamba&quot; is a South African hymn originally written in the Zulu language that became popular in North American churches in the 1990s.

The remix of the 2019 worldwide hit &quot;Jerusalema&quot; contains lyrics in Zulu language.

===Standard vs Urban Zulu===
Standard Zulu as it is taught in schools, also called &quot;deep Zulu&quot; (&quot;isiZulu esijulile&quot;), differs in various respects from the language spoken by people living in cities (Urban Zulu, &quot;isiZulu sasedolobheni&quot;). Standard Zulu tends to be purist, using derivations from Zulu words for new concepts, whereas speakers of Urban Zulu use loan words abundantly, mainly from English. For example: 

This situation has led to problems in education because standard Zulu is often not understood by young people.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

The vowel system of Zulu consists of five vowels.

 and are pronounced [] and [], respectively, if the following syllable contains the [+ATR] vowels or . They are and otherwise:
* &quot;umgibeli&quot; &quot;passenger&quot;, phonetically 
* &quot;ukupheka&quot; &quot;to cook&quot;, phonetically 

There is limited vowel length in Zulu, as a result of the contraction of certain syllables. For example, the word &quot;ithambo&quot; &quot;bone&quot;, is a contraction of an earlier &quot;ilithambo&quot; , which may still be used by some speakers. Likewise, &quot;uphahla&quot; &quot;roof&quot; is a contraction of the earlier &quot;uluphahla&quot; . In addition, the vowel of the penultimate syllable is allophonically lengthened phrase- or sentence-finally.

===Consonants===
# The plain voiceless plosives, affricates and clicks are realised phonetically as ejectives , , , , .
# When not preceded by a nasal, is almost in complementary distribution with and . The latter two phonemes occur almost exclusively root-initially, while appears exclusively medially. Recent loanwords contain and in other positions, e.g. &quot;isekhondi&quot; &quot;second&quot;, &quot;ibhayisikili&quot; &quot;bicycle&quot;.
# The slack-voiced consonants are depressor consonants. These have a lowering effect on the tone of their syllable. 
# The consonant occurs in some dialects as a reduction of the cluster when it is not in stem-initial position, and is therefore always slack-voiced.
# The trill is not native to Zulu and occurs only in expressive words and in recent borrowings from European languages.

The use of click consonants is one of the most distinctive features of Zulu. This feature is shared with several other languages of Southern Africa, but it is very rare in other regions. There are three basic articulations of clicks in Zulu:
* Denti-alveolar , comparable to a sucking of teeth, as the sound one makes for &#x27;tsk tsk&#x27;.
* Postalveolar , comparable to a bottle top &#x27;pop&#x27;.
* Lateral , comparable to a click that one may do for a walking horse.

Each articulation covers five click consonants, with differences such as being slack-voiced, aspirated or nasalised, for a total of 15.

===Phonotactics===

Zulu syllables are canonically (N)C(w)V, and words must always end in a vowel. Consonant clusters consist of any consonant, optionally preceded by a homorganic nasal consonant (so-called &quot;prenasalisation&quot;, described in more detail below) and optionally followed by the consonant .

In addition, syllabic occurs as a reduction of former , and acts like a true syllable: it can be syllabic even when not word-initial, and can also carry distinctive tones like a full syllable. It does not necessarily have to be homorganic with the following consonant, although the difference between homorganic nonsyllabic and syllabic is distinctive, e.g. &quot;umpetshisi&quot; &quot;peach tree&quot; (5 syllables) versus &quot;impoko&quot; &quot;grass flower&quot; (3 syllables). Moreover, sequences of syllabic &quot;m&quot; and homorganic &quot;m&quot; can occur, e.g. &quot;ummbila&quot; &quot;maize&quot; (4 syllables).

Recent loanwords from languages such as English may violate these constraints, by including additional consonant clusters that are not native to Zulu, such as in &quot;igremu&quot; &quot;gram&quot;. There may be some variation between speakers as to whether clusters are broken up by an epenthetic vowel or not, e.g. &quot;ikhompiyutha&quot; or &quot;ikhompyutha&quot; &quot;computer&quot;.

===Prosody===

====Stress====

Stress in Zulu words is mostly predictable and normally falls on the penultimate syllable of a word. It is accompanied by an allophonic lengthening of the vowel. When the final vowel of a word is long due to contraction, it receives the stress instead of the preceding syllable.

Lengthening does not occur on all words in a sentence, however, but only those that are sentence- or phrase-final. Thus, for any word of at least two syllables, there are two different forms, one with penultimate length and one without it, occurring in complementary distribution. In some cases, there are morphemic alternations that occur as a result of word position as well. The remote demonstrative pronouns may appear with the suffix &quot;-ana&quot; when sentence-final, but only as &quot;-ā&quot; otherwise. Likewise, the recent past tense of verbs ends in &quot;-ile&quot; sentence-finally, but is reduced to &quot;-ē&quot; medially. Moreover, a falling tone can only occur on a long vowel, so the shortening has effects on tone as well.

Some words, such as ideophones or interjections, can have stress that deviates from the regular pattern.

====Tone====

Like almost all other Bantu and other African languages, Zulu is tonal. There are three main &quot;tonemes&quot;: low, high and falling. Zulu is conventionally written without any indication of tone, but tone can be distinctive in Zulu. For example, the words &quot;priest&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot; are both spelt &quot;umfundisi&quot;, but they are pronounced with different tones: for the &quot;priest&quot; meaning, and for the &quot;teacher&quot; meaning.

In principle, every syllable can be pronounced with either a high or a low tone. However, low tone does not behave the same as the other two, as high tones can &quot;spread&quot; into low-toned syllables while the reverse does not occur. A low tone is therefore better described as the &quot;absence&quot; of any toneme; it is a kind of default tone that is overridden by high or falling tones. The falling tone is a sequence of high-low and occurs only on long vowels. The penultimate syllable can also bear a falling tone when it is long due to the word&#x27;s position in the phrase. However, when it shortens, the falling tone becomes disallowed in that position.

In principle, every morpheme has an inherent underlying tone pattern which does not change regardless of where it appears in a word. However, like most other Bantu languages, Zulu has word tone, meaning that the pattern of tones acts more like a template to assign tones to individual syllables, rather than a direct representation of the pronounced tones themselves. Consequently, the relationship between underlying tone patterns and the tones that are pronounced can be quite complex. Underlying high tones tend to surface rightward from the syllables where they are underlyingly present, especially in longer words.

====Depressor consonants====

The breathy consonant phonemes in Zulu are depressor consonants or depressors for short. Depressor consonants have a lowering effect on pitch, adding a non-phonemic low-tone onset to the normal tone of the syllable. Thus, in syllables with depressor consonants, high tones are realised as rising, and falling tones as rising-then-falling. In both cases, the pitch does not reach as high as in non-depressed syllables. The possible tones on a syllable with a voiceless consonant like &quot;hla&quot; are , and the possible tones of a breathy consonant syllable, like &quot;dla&quot;, are . A depressor does not affect a syllable that&#x27;s already low, but it blocks assimilation to a preceding high tone so that the tone of the depressor syllable and any following low-tone syllables stays low.

===Phonological processes===

====Prenasalisation====

Prenasalisation occurs whenever a consonant is preceded by a homorganic nasal, either lexically or as a consequence of prefixation. The most notable case of the latter is the class 9 noun prefix &quot;in-&quot;, which ends in a homorganic nasal. Prenasalisation triggers several changes in the following consonant, some of which are phonemic and others allophonic. The changes can be summed as follows:

====Tone assimilation====

Zulu has tonic assimilation: high tones tend to spread allophonically to following low-tone syllables, raising their pitch to a level just below that of adjacent high-tone syllables. A toneless syllable between a high-tone syllable and another tonic syllable assimilates to that high tone. That is, if the preceding syllable ends on a high tone and the following syllable begins with a high tone (because it is high or falling), the intermediate toneless syllable has its pitch raised as well. When the preceding syllable is high but the following is toneless, the medial toneless syllable adopts a high-tone onset from the preceding syllable, resulting in a falling tone contour.

For example, the English word &quot;spoon&quot; was borrowed into Zulu as , phonemically . The second syllable assimilates to the surrounding high tones, raising its pitch, so that it is pronounced sentence-finally. If tone pitch is indicated with numbers, with 1 highest and 9 lowest pitch, then the pitches of each syllable can be denoted as 2-4-3-9. The second syllable is thus still lower in pitch than both of the adjacent syllables.

====Tone displacement====

Depressor consonants have an effect called &quot;tone displacement&quot;. Tone displacement occurs whenever a depressor occurs with a high tone, and causes the tone on the syllable to shift rightward onto the next syllable. If the next syllable is long, it gets a falling tone, otherwise a regular high tone. If the penultimate syllable becomes high (not falling), the final syllable dissimilates and becomes low if it was not already. Tone displacement is blocked under the following conditions:
* When the syllable has a long vowel.
* When the following syllable also has a depressor consonant.
* When the following syllable is the final syllable and is short.

Whenever tone displacement is blocked, this results in a depressor syllable with a high tone, which will have the low-tone onset as described above. When the following syllable already has a high or falling tone, the tone disappears from the syllable as if it had been shifted away, but the following syllable&#x27;s tone is not modified.

Some examples:
* &quot;spoons&quot;, the plural of from the previous section, is phonemically . Because is a depressor consonant, tone assimilation is prevented. Consequently, the word is pronounced as sentence-finally, with a low tone in the second syllable.
* &quot;girls&quot; is phonemically . is a depressor, and is not blocked, so the tone shifts to the third syllable. This syllable can be either long or short depending on sentence position. When long, the pronunciation is , with a falling tone. However, when the third syllable is short, the tone is high, and dissimilation of the final syllable occurs, resulting in .
* &quot;with a man&quot; is phonemically . is a depressor, but so is , so tone displacement is blocked. Consequently, the pronunciation is , with rising pitch in the first syllable due to the low-onset effect.

====Palatalization====

Palatalization is a change that affects labial and alveolar consonants whenever they are immediately followed by . While palatalization occurred historically, it is still productive and occurs as a result of the addition of suffixes beginning with . A frequent example is the diminutive suffix .

Moreover, Zulu does not generally tolerate sequences of a labial consonant plus . Whenever follows a labial consonant, it changes to , which then triggers palatalization of the consonant. This effect can be seen in the locative forms of nouns ending in or , which change to and respectively in the locative. If a labial consonant immediately precedes, palatalization is triggered. The change also occurs in nouns beginning in with a stem beginning with a vowel.

The following changes occur as a result of palatalization:

==Orthography==
Zulu employs the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. However, some of the letters have different pronunciations than in English. Additional phonemes are written using sequences of multiple letters. Tone, stress and vowel length are not indicated.

Reference works and older texts may use additional letters. A common former practice was to indicate the implosive using the special letter , while the digraph would then be simply written as . Some references may also write after letters to indicate that they are of the depressor variety, e.g. , , , a practice that is standard in Xhosa orthography.

Very early texts, from the early 20th century or before, tend to omit the distinction between plain and aspirated voiceless consonants, writing the latter without the .

Nouns are written with their prefixes as one orthographical word. If the prefix ends with a vowel (as most do) and the noun stem also begins with a vowel, a hyphen is inserted in between, e.g. . This occurs only with loanwords.

==Morphology==

Here are some of the main features of Zulu:

* Word order is subject–verb–object.
* Morphologically, it is an agglutinative language.
* As in other Bantu languages, Zulu nouns are classified into morphological classes or &quot;genders&quot; (16 in Zulu), with different prefixes for singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a noun must agree with the noun according to its gender. Such agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which it is agreeing. An example is the use of the class &quot;aba-&quot;:

::&quot;All the strong people on the farm are felling (trees).&quot;

:The various agreements that qualify the word &quot;abantu&quot; (people) can be seen in effect.

* Its verbal system shows a combination of temporal and aspectual categories in their finite paradigm. Typically verbs have two stems, one for present-undefinite and another for perfect. Different prefixes can be attached to these verbal stems to specify subject agreement and various degrees of past or future tense. For example, in the word (&quot;he loves&quot;), the present stem of the verb is , the prefix expresses the third-person singular subject and is a filler that is used in short sentences.
:Suffixes are also put into common use to show the causative or reciprocal forms of a verb stem.
* Most property words (words encoded as adjectives in English) are represented by relatives. In the sentence (&quot;the person is red&quot;), the word (root ) behaves like a verb and uses the agreement prefix . however, there are subtle differences; for example, it does not use the prefix .

===Morphology of root &quot;Zulu&quot;===
The root can be combined with several prefixes and thus create other words. For example, here is a table with some words constructed from the roots - and (the root for &quot;person/people&quot;):

== Counting in Zulu ==

=== Counting from 1 to 10 ===
The digital numerical counting etiquette on the fingers begins with the little finger of the left hand to the left thumb and then continues with the right-hand thumb towards the right little finger. Starting with a closed left hand, each finger is extended with each subsequent number from one to five. Once the left hand is open, then counting continues on the right hand with each finger opening in turn. It is noteworthy that in Zulu, the names for the numbers six to nine reflect either the anatomical name of the digit (six, , means &quot;thumb&quot;), action (seven, , means &quot;the one that points out&quot;), or position/placement (eight or , means &quot;two remaining&quot;, and nine or , indicating &quot;one remaining&quot;).

===Proverbs===
In 1912, Franz Mayr, an Austrian missionary in southern Africa from 1890 until his death in 1914, published a collection of 150 proverbs in Zulu with an English translation. The proverbs include:
*&quot;&quot;Inhlwa aibanjwa ngekanda isavela&quot;.&quot; &quot;The winged termite is not caught by its head as soon as it appears (i.e. wait till you have heard the whole story before you judge or even answer).&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Aku &#x27;qaqa lazizwa ukunuka&quot;.&quot; &quot;No polecat ever smelt its own stink (i.e. nobody recognises his own faults).&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Aku&#x27;nkwali epandela enya&quot;.&quot; &quot;There is no partridge that scratches for another (i.e. everyone looks after his own interests).&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Ikot&#x27;eyikotayo&quot;.&quot; &quot;The cow licks the one that licks her (said of people who help one another).&quot;

John Colenso also included a selection of Zulu proverbs with English translations in his &quot;Zulu-English Dictionary,&quot; first published in 1884. Here are some of those proverbs:
*&quot;Iqina lipum&#x27;embizeni.&quot; &quot;The buck has jumped out of the pot (i.e. it has escaped the hunter just when he thought he had it).&quot;
*&quot;Izubela ladhl&#x27;indhlovu.&quot; &quot;The wood-shaving killed the elephant (by striking it in the eye; used of a small matter producing a very serious result).&quot;
*&quot;Aku&#x27;mmango ungena&#x27;liba.&quot; &quot;There is no hill without a grave (i.e. death is everywhere).&quot;

===Tales===

In 1868, Henry Callaway published a collection of traditional Zulu tales told by storytellers in the Colony of Natal; the book includes the Zulu text accompanied by an English translation. The stories include the Tale of Uhlakanyana, a long cycle narrating the adventures of the famous Zulu trickster figure; the story of the Zulu hero Usikulumi and his family; the story of Usitungusohenthle who was carried away by pigeons; and the legend of the mythical bird that gave milk, along with an account of the very real honeyguide bird, called &quot;inhlamvu&quot; in Zulu.
There are many cannibal stories, including &quot;Itshe Likantunjambili&quot;, &quot;The Cannibal&#x27;s Cave;&quot; &quot;Intombi Namazimu&quot;, &quot;The Girl and the Cannibals;&quot; &quot;Umbadhlanyana and the Cannibal;&quot; and &quot;Amazimu,&quot; &quot;Cannibals,&quot; along with an appendix on cannibalism. Women are the main characters in many of the stories, such as &quot;Ugungqu-Kubantwana,&quot; the popular folktale of the old woman who must seek a pond of clear water; the tale of Princess Umkxakaza-Wakogingqwayo; the tale of Princess Umdhlubu; and the tale of Princess Untombi-Yapansi, along with the story of &quot;Ununana-Bosele&quot;, the woman who defeated a swallowing monster in the form of an elephant. Some stories, like &quot;Ubongopa-Kamagadhlela&quot;,
feature numerous songs in Zulu, for which Callaway provides the lyrics but not the music.

In 1870, Callaway published &quot;The Religious System of the Amazulu&quot; which also contains Zulu texts and English translations, including &quot;Unkulunkulu&quot;, &quot;The Tradition of Creation,&quot; along with lengthy Zulu testimony regarding ancestor worship, dream interpretation, divination, and medicine.

===Riddles===

Callaway&#x27;s 1868 collection of Zulu texts also contains 12 riddles in Zulu with an English translation. The riddles include:
*&quot;&quot;Kqandela ni inkomo e hlatshelwa &#x27;zibayeni zibili (intwala, ngokuba umuntu u ya i tata engutsheni, ka namandhla oku i bulala ngesitupa si sinye; uma e nga hlanganisi izitupa zozibili, a i kcindezele, i fe&quot;.&quot; &quot;Guess ye an ox which is slaughtered in two cattle-pens (a louse, for a man takes it out of his blanket, but he cannot kill it with one thumb; but only by bringing the two thumbs together, and squeezing it between them that it may die).&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Kqandela ni indoba e nga lali; ku ze ku se i mi, i nga lele (insika a i lali, ngokuba i y&#x27; ema njalo, i linde indhlu)&quot;.&quot; &quot;Guess ye a man who does not lie down; even when it is morning he is standing, he not having lain down (a pillar does not lie down, for it stands constantly and watches the house).&quot;
There are six Zulu riddles reported in the &quot;Folklore Journal&quot; of the South African Folklore Society in 1880. Here are two of them: 
*&quot;Ngi tshele ibizo le&#x27;nyoka ende e dhlula izinyoka ezinye? (indhlela).&quot; &quot;Tell me the name of the longest snake? (a road).&quot;
*&quot;Ngu bani oma njalo a ngez&#x27;a hlala pansi? (ishilahla).&quot; &quot;Who is it that stands always and never sits? (a tree).&quot;

===Songs===
In 1920, Madikane Čele contributed Zulu song lyrics and music to Natalie Curtis Burlin&#x27;s book &quot;Songs and Tales from the Dark Continent&quot;. Zulu texts and English translations, plus commentary, are provided for &quot;Iga&#x27;ma Le &#x27;Mpi,&quot; &quot;A Song of War;&quot; &quot;Iga&#x27;ma La Bantwa&#x27;na,&quot; &quot;A Song of Children&quot; (lullaby); &quot;Iga&#x27;ma Lo Kusi&#x27;na,&quot; &quot;A Dance-Song;&quot; &quot;Iga&#x27;ma Lo Ta&#x27;ndo,&quot; &quot;A Love-Song,&quot; along with the music for the songs.

==Zulu words in South African English==
South African English has absorbed many words from the Zulu language. Others, such as the names of local animals ( and are both Zulu names) have made their way into standard English. A few examples of Zulu words used in South African English:

* muti (from ) – medicine
* donga (from ) – ditch ( means &quot;wall&quot; in Zulu and is also the name for ditches caused by soil erosion)
* – conference (it means &quot;an item of news&quot;&#x27; in Zulu)
* – chief right handman or leader
* songololo (from ) – millipede
* – compassion/humanity.

<doc id="61488" wikidata="Q603715" url="?curid=61488" title="List of counties of New Brunswick">
<text>The Canadian province of New Brunswick has 15 counties, originating in the British tradition of local courts for civil and judicial administration that were officiated by the colony&#x27;s appointed magistrates. 

Counties, parishes and shiretowns are delineated in the Territorial Division Act. While no longer administrative divisions, they continue to define regional communities and have many legacy functions and provincial applications. They figure prominently in residents&#x27; sense of place and continue as significant threads in the Province of New Brunswick&#x27;s cultural fabric (i.e., most citizens always know which county they are in).
Counties are used as the basis of census divisions by Statistics Canada in the national census, while their parishes are the basis for census subdivisions.

==History==
The push for responsible government would see the municipal system of elective local government replace the magistracy, and in 1877 it was made mandatory that the province&#x27;s county courts of sessions would municipalize.

&quot;Sweeping&quot; reforms of the Robichaud premiership in 1966 ceased all county local government function, consequent to the government&#x27;s New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program which brought about dissolution of county entities in favour of a ministerial upper tier, among other reforms local government related or otherwise.

Counties were not replaced with another form of regional local government. Instead, many small village municipalities were created, with the surrounding predominantly rural areas financing local services and facilities through local service districts until the reform of local governance in 2023.

=== Origin ===
The partitioning of Nova Scotia at the close of the American Revolutionary War was discreetly attributed by the British to the distance between the St. John river communities and the administrative centre at Halifax. The arrival of American Loyalist refugees saw the population in the colony grow abruptly, with many directed to Sunbury county&#x27;s Wolastoq/Saint John river.

Initially, when Nova Scotia&#x27;s authorities established counties for the first time in 1759, the vast territory of former Acadia to the north of Kings County was erected as Cumberland, until in April 30, 1765, when the county was sectioned for the residents of the townships along the coastline and in the lower Saint John River valley. The new county was called Sunbury.

It would not be until 24 May 1770 that a boundary would be established between the two counties. Sunbury’s western boundary was described as starting at the head of the St. Croix River, following the north line to the Saint John River and then to the southern Canadian border. This description actually overlapped a part of Maine’s territory, as you would have needed to go far west, towards the area near the source of the Chaudière River. On the east the boundary with Cumberland ran north by the magnet from a point 20 miles up from Mispec. No further changes would be made until 1785, when the recently partitioned New Brunswick province&#x27;s government established new counties.

=== Creation ===
New Brunswick was created on June 18, 1784. The province was divided into eight counties by decree of Governor Carleton: Charlotte, Kings, Northumberland, Queens, Saint John, Sunbury, Westmorland and York. In January 1786, the first session of the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly was held in Saint John, at which the MLA’s passed &quot;An Act for the better ascertaining and confirming the Boundaries of Several Counties within this Province, and for subdividing them into Towns or Parishes&quot;. As the council worked on developing the original county lines, they desperately needed maps of the province, which, at the time, they seemingly lacked. As a result, they relied on two maps by Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres from 1780, the best candidates for a map of New Brunswick at the time. As the new boundaries were established, the former counties of Cumberland and Sunbury were disregarded, with the exception of the starting point of the boundary between Westmorland and Northumberland counties, which shared a resemblance to the old boundaries, though this might have been a coincidence.

The county lines were strategically drawn to align with the watersheds, a logical decision given that New Brunswick&#x27;s settlements were developed along waterways. Additionally, the counties were able to be divided into three groups: the Bay of Fundy, the Saint John River and the North Shore.

<doc id="61489" wikidata="Q180736" url="?curid=61489" title="Les Misérables">
<text>Les Misérables (, ) is a French epic historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published on 31 March 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century. &quot;Les Misérables&quot; has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film, television, and the stage, including a musical.

In the English-speaking world, the novel is usually referred to by its original French title. However, several alternatives have been used, including &quot;The Miserables&quot;, &quot;The Wretched&quot;, &quot;The Miserable Ones&quot;, &quot;The Poor Ones&quot;, &quot;The Wretched Poor&quot;, &quot;The Victims&quot;, and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;. Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption.

Examining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the history of France, the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love.

== Novel form ==
Upton Sinclair described the novel as &quot;one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world&quot; and remarked that Hugo set forth the purpose of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in the preface:

Towards the end of the novel, Hugo explains the work&#x27;s overarching structure:

The novel contains various subplots, but the main thread is the story of ex-convict Jean Valjean, who becomes a force for good in the world but cannot escape his criminal past. The novel is divided into 5 volumes, each divided into several books and subdivided into chapters, for a total of 48 books and 365 chapters. Each chapter is relatively short, commonly no longer than a few pages.

The novel as a whole is one of the longest ever written, with 655,478 words in the original French. Hugo explained his ambitions for the novel to his Italian publisher:

=== Digressions ===
More than a quarter of the novel—by one count 955 of 2,783 pages—is devoted to essays that argue a moral point or display Hugo&#x27;s encyclopedic knowledge but do not advance the plot, nor even a subplot, a method Hugo used in such other works as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; and &quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot;. One biographer noted, &quot;The digressions of genius are easily pardoned&quot;. The topics Hugo addresses include cloistered religious orders, the construction of the Paris sewers, argot, and the street urchins of Paris. The one about convents he titles &quot;Parenthesis&quot; to alert the reader to its irrelevance to the storyline.

Hugo devotes another 19 chapters (Volume II, Book I) to an account—and meditation on the place in history—of the Battle of Waterloo, the battlefield of which Hugo visited in 1861 and where he finished writing the novel. It opens volume 2 with such a change of subject as to seem the beginning of an entirely different work. The fact that this &quot;digression&quot; occupies such a large part of the text demands that it be read in the context of the &quot;overarching structure&quot; discussed above. Hugo draws his own personal conclusions, taking Waterloo to be a pivot point in history but definitely not a victory for the forces of reaction.

One critic has called this &quot;the spiritual gateway&quot; to the novel, as its chance encounter of Thénardier and Colonel Pontmercy foreshadows so many of the novel&#x27;s encounters &quot;blending chance and necessity&quot;, a &quot;confrontation of heroism and villainy&quot;.

Even when not turning to other subjects outside his narrative, Hugo sometimes interrupts the straightforward recitation of events, his voice and control of the storyline unconstrained by time and sequence. The novel opens with a statement about the bishop of Digne in 1815 and immediately shifts: &quot;Although these details in no way essentially concern that which we have to tell...&quot; Only after 14 chapters does Hugo pick up the opening thread again, &quot;In the early days of the month of October 1815...&quot;, to introduce Jean Valjean.

==Hugo&#x27;s sources==

An incident Hugo witnessed in 1829 involved three strangers and a police officer. One of the strangers was a man who had stolen a loaf of bread, similar to Jean Valjean, being taken to the coach by a police officer. Nearby, two onlookers, a mother and daughter, had stopped to watch the thief. They became the inspiration for Fantine and Cosette. Hugo imagined the life of the man in jail and the mother and daughter taken away from each other.

Valjean&#x27;s character is loosely based on the life of the ex-convict Eugène François Vidocq. Vidocq became the head of an undercover police unit and later founded France&#x27;s first private detective agency. He was also a businessman and was widely noted for his social engagement and philanthropy. Vidocq also inspired Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Claude Gueux&quot; and &quot;Le Dernier jour d&#x27;un condamné&quot; (&quot;The Last Day of a Condemned Man&quot;).

In 1828, Vidocq, already pardoned, saved one of the workers in his paper factory by lifting a heavy cart on his shoulders as Valjean does. Hugo&#x27;s description of Valjean rescuing a sailor on the &quot;Orion&quot; draws almost word for word on a Baron La Roncière&#x27;s letter describing such an incident. Hugo used Bienvenu de Miollis (1753–1843), the Bishop of Digne during the time in which Valjean encounters Myriel, as the model for Myriel.

Hugo had used the departure of prisoners from the Bagne of Toulon in one of his early stories, &quot;Le Dernier Jour d&#x27;un Condamné&quot;. He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845. On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: &quot;JEAN TRÉJEAN&quot;. When the book was finally written, Tréjean became Valjean.

In 1841, Hugo saved a prostitute from arrest for assault. He used a short part of his dialogue with the police when recounting Valjean&#x27;s rescue of Fantine in the novel. On 22 February 1846, when he had begun work on the novel, Hugo witnessed the arrest of a bread thief while a duchess and her child watched the scene pitilessly from their coach. He spent several vacations in Montreuil-sur-Mer.

During the 1832 revolt, Hugo walked the streets of Paris, saw the barricades blocking his way at points, and had to take shelter from gunfire. He participated more directly in the 1848 Paris insurrection, helping to smash barricades and suppress both the popular revolt and its monarchist allies.

Victor Hugo drew his inspiration from everything he heard and saw, writing it down in his diary. In December 1846, he witnessed an altercation between an old woman scavenging through rubbish and a street urchin who might have been Gavroche. He also informed himself by personal inspection of the Paris Conciergerie in 1846 and Waterloo in 1861, by gathering information on some industries, and on working-class people&#x27;s wages and living standards. He asked his mistresses, Léonie d&#x27;Aunet and Juliette Drouet, to tell him about life in convents. He also slipped personal anecdotes into the plot. For instance, Marius and Cosette&#x27;s wedding night (Part V, Book 6, Chapter 1) takes place on 16 February 1833, which is also the date when Hugo and his lifelong mistress Juliette Drouet made love for the first time.

A template for Hugo&#x27;s novel was &quot;Les Mystères de Paris&quot; (&quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot;), a serial novel of similar length that enjoyed great success on its appearance in 1842–43, by Eugène Sue. &quot;Les mystères&quot;, like &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, views contemporary Paris from the point of view of the downtrodden and criminal underclasses who had been little represented in novels up to the time and features the interventions of detectives and the indifference of aristocrats. Although socially progressive in tone, it is more sensationalist than &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and does not have the same breadth of moral vision.

==Plot==
===Volume I: Fantine===
In 1815 Digne, the peasant Jean Valjean, just released from 19 years&#x27; imprisonment in the Bagne of Toulon—five for stealing bread for his starving sister and her family and fourteen more for numerous escape attempts—is turned away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.

Digne&#x27;s benevolent Bishop Myriel gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel&#x27;s silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his soul has been purchased for God and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.

Valjean broods over Myriel&#x27;s words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-sou coin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and panics, searching the city for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him because if he is apprehended, he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.

Six years pass, and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town&#x27;s police inspector, Inspector Javert, who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean&#x27;s incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.

Years earlier in Paris, a grisette named Fantine was very much in love with Félix Tholomyès. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle, were also paired with Fantine&#x27;s friends Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomyès&#x27;s daughter, Cosette. When Fantine arrives at Montfermeil, she leaves Cosette in the care of the Thénardiers, a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.

Fantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate, and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean&#x27;s factory because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Thénardiers&#x27; monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth and resorts to prostitution to pay the Thénardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.

A dandy named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists, but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.

Javert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.

After Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet and then reveals to her Valjean&#x27;s real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine&#x27;s body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave.

===Volume II: Cosette===

Valjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in the Bagne of Toulon, Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship&#x27;s rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.

Valjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Thénardiers abuse her while pampering their own daughters, Éponine and Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to give Cosette a present of an expensive new doll, which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. Éponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Thénardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean&#x27;s behavior, caring only that he pays for his food and lodging.

The next morning, Valjean informs the Thénardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Thénardier immediately accepts while Thénardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Thénardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Thénardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child&#x27;s mother. Valjean hands Thénardier Fantine&#x27;s letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Thénardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Thénardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back towards home.

Valjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at the Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean&#x27;s lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette, and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent&#x27;s gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener, and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.

===Volume III: Marius===
Eight years later, the Friends of the ABC, led by Enjolras, are preparing an act of anti-Orléanist civil unrest (i.e., the Paris uprising on 5–6 June 1832, a setting contrary to the popular notion that the book is set in the 1789 French Revolution) following the death of Lamarque, a popular general known for his sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells. The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of the &quot;Cour des miracles&quot;, including the Thénardiers&#x27; eldest son, Gavroche, who is a street urchin.

One of the students, Marius Pontmercy, has become alienated from his family (especially his royalist grandfather, M. Gillenormand) because of his Bonapartist views. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Thénardier who saved his life at Waterloo—in reality, Thénardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy&#x27;s life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant under Napoleon to avoid exposing himself as a robber.

At the Luxembourg Garden, Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Thénardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname Jondrette at the Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Thénardiers&#x27; inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Thénardiers.

Éponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing &quot;The Cops Are Here&quot; on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the &quot;Jondrettes&quot; in their apartment through a crack in the wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Thénardier had hoped).

The philanthropist and his daughter—actually Valjean and Cosette—enter. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises to return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks Éponine to retrieve her address for him. Éponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees. The Thénardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Thénardier enlists the aid of Patron-Minette, a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.

Marius overhears Thénardier&#x27;s plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Thénardier sends Éponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Thénardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him, revealing his true identity. Marius recognizes Thénardier as the man who saved his father&#x27;s life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.

He tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Thénardier. Valjean denies knowing Thénardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Thénardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, saying they will keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Thénardier of his address, Thénardier sends out Mme. Thénardier to get Cosette. Mme. Thénardier comes back alone and announces the address is a fake.

It is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Thénardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that Éponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Thénardiers&#x27; apartment through the wall crack. Thénardier reads it and thinks Éponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Thénardier, and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.

He arrests all the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette (except Claquesous, who escapes during his transportation to prison, and Montparnasse, who stops to run off with Éponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.

===Volume IV: The Idyll in the Rue Plumet and the Epic in the Rue St. Denis===

After Éponine&#x27;s release from prison, she finds Marius at &quot;the Field of the Lark&quot; and sadly tells him that she found Cosette&#x27;s address. She leads him to Valjean and Cosette&#x27;s house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Thénardier, Patron-Minette, and Brujon manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius&#x27;s visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean and Cosette&#x27;s house. However, Éponine, who has been sitting by the gates, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week, which greatly troubles the pair.

The next day, Valjean is sitting in the Champ de Mars. He is feeling troubled about seeing Thénardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap. It says, &quot;Move Out.&quot; He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes home, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l&#x27;Homme-Armé, and restates that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry but has been longing for Marius&#x27;s return. When tempers flare, he refuses to consent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.

The following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that he is a spy. When Enjolras confronts Javert about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius returns to Valjean and Cosette&#x27;s house on Rue Plumet but finds it no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.

When Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot him. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier&#x27;s gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, and a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.

Marius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for him earlier calls him by his name. Marius discovers this man is Éponine, dressed in men&#x27;s clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.

The author also tells the reader that Éponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. Éponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to having obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him but deciding to do so for fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, Éponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was &quot;a little bit in love&quot; with him, and dies.

Marius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is from Cosette. He learns Cosette&#x27;s whereabouts and writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette&#x27;s lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.

===Volume V: Jean Valjean===

Valjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man&#x27;s life. He is still uncertain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.

Valjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius&#x27;s body. He evades a police patrol and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Thénardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Thénardier, but Thénardier doesn&#x27;t recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim&#x27;s corpse, Thénardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean&#x27;s and Marius&#x27;s pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius&#x27;s coat so he can determine his identity later. Thénardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean&#x27;s emergence from the sewer to distract the policeman who has been pursuing him.

Upon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly, Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather&#x27;s house, Valjean asks for a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window, he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but cannot ignore his duty to the law either. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine.

Marius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during Mardi Gras festivities, Valjean is spotted by Thénardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean&#x27;s moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean&#x27;s time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius&#x27;s judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.

Thénardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Thénardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius&#x27;s misconceptions about Valjean by revealing all the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is a murderer and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Thénardier&#x27;s face. He then confronts Thénardier about his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Thénardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America, where he becomes a slave trader.

As they rush to Valjean&#x27;s house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother&#x27;s story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Characters==
===Major===
* Jean Valjean (also known as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre) – The protagonist of the novel. He was born in Faverolles, Aisne. Convicted for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister&#x27;s seven starving children and sent to prison for five years, he is paroled from prison nineteen years later (after four unsuccessful escape attempts added twelve years and fighting back during the second escape attempt added two extra years). Rejected by society for being a former convict, he encounters Bishop Myriel, who turns his life around by showing him mercy and encouraging him to become a new man. While sitting and pondering what Bishop Myriel had said, he puts his shoe on a forty-sou piece dropped by a young wanderer. Valjean threatens the boy with his stick when the boy attempts to rouse him from his reverie and recover his money. He tells a passing priest his name and the name of the boy, which allows the police to charge him with armed robbery – a sentence that, if he were caught again, would return him to prison for life. He assumes a new identity (Monsieur Madeleine) in order to pursue an honest life. He introduces new manufacturing techniques and eventually builds two factories, becoming one of the richest men in the area. By popular acclaim, he is made mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. He confronts Javert over Fantine&#x27;s punishment, turns himself in to the police to save another man from prison for life, and rescues Cosette from the Thénardiers. Discovered by Javert in Paris because of his generosity to the poor, he evades capture for the next several years in a convent. He saves Marius from imprisonment and probable death at the barricade, reveals his true identity to Marius and Cosette after their wedding, and is reunited with them just before his death, having kept his promise to the bishop and to Fantine, the image of whom is the last thing he sees before dying.
* Javert – A fanatic police inspector in pursuit to recapture Valjean. Born in the prisons to a convict father and a fortune teller mother, he renounces both of them and starts working as a guard in the prison, including one stint as the overseer for the chain gang of which Valjean is part (and here witnesses firsthand Valjean&#x27;s enormous strength and just what he looks like). Eventually, he joins the police force in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He arrests Fantine and comes into conflict with Valjean/Madeleine, who orders him to release Fantine. Valjean dismisses Javert in front of his squad, and Javert, seeking revenge, reports to the police inspector that he has discovered Jean Valjean. He is told that he must be incorrect, as a man mistakenly believed to be Jean Valjean was just arrested. He requests M. Madeleine to dismiss him in disgrace, for he cannot be less harsh on himself than on others. When the real Jean Valjean turns himself in, Javert is promoted to the Paris police force, where he arrests Valjean and sends him back to prison. After Valjean escapes again, Javert attempts one more arrest in vain. He almost recaptures Valjean at the Gorbeau House when he arrests the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette. Later, while working undercover behind the barricade, his identity is discovered. Valjean pretends to execute Javert but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral. After composing a letter to the prefect of police outlining the squalid conditions that occur in prisons and the abuses that prisoners are subjected to, he takes his own life by jumping into the Seine.
* Fantine – She was born in Montreuil-sur-Mer but moved to Paris as a teenager. This grisette was abandoned with a small child by her lover, Félix Tholomyès. Fantine leaves her daughter, Cosette, in the care of the Thénardiers, innkeepers in the village of Montfermeil. Mme. Thénardier spoils her own daughters and abuses Cosette. Fantine finds work at Monsieur Madeleine&#x27;s factory. Illiterate, she has others write letters to the Thénardiers on her behalf. A female supervisor discovers that she is an unwed mother and dismisses her. To meet the Thénardiers&#x27; repeated demands for money, she sells her hair and two front teeth and turns to prostitution. She becomes ill. Valjean learns of her plight when Javert arrests her for attacking a man who called her insulting names and threw snow down her back. He sends her to a hospital. Because her illness has made her so weak, she dies of shock when Javert, confronting Valjean in her hospital room, reveals that Valjean is a convict and has not brought Cosette to her (after the doctor encouraged the incorrect belief that Jean Valjean&#x27;s recent absence was because he was bringing her daughter to her).
* Cosette (formally Euphrasie, also known as &quot;the Lark&quot;, Mademoiselle Lanoire, Ursula) – The illegitimate daughter of Fantine and Tholomyès. From approximately the age of three to the age of eight, she is beaten and forced to work as a drudge for the Thénardiers. After her mother dies, Valjean ransoms her from the Thénardiers and cares for her as if she were his daughter. Nuns in a Paris convent educate her. She grows up to become very beautiful. She falls in love with Marius Pontmercy and marries him near the novel&#x27;s conclusion.
* Marius Pontmercy – A young law student loosely associated with the Friends of the ABC. He shares the political principles of his father and has a tempestuous relationship with his royalist grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand. He falls in love with Cosette and fights on the barricades when he believes Valjean has taken her to London. After he and Cosette marry, he recognizes Thénardier as a swindler and pays him to leave France.
* Éponine (the Jondrette girl) – The Thénardiers&#x27; elder daughter. As a child, she is pampered and spoiled by her parents but ends up a street urchin when she reaches adolescence. She participates in her father&#x27;s crimes and begging schemes to obtain money. She is blindly in love with Marius. At Marius&#x27;s request, she finds Valjean and Cosette&#x27;s house for him and sadly leads him there. She also prevents her father, Patron-Minette, and Brujon from robbing the house during one of Marius&#x27;s visits there to see Cosette. After disguising herself as a boy, she manipulates Marius into going to the barricades, hoping she and Marius will die there together. Wanting to die before him, however, she reaches out her hand to stop a soldier from shooting at him; she is mortally wounded as the bullet goes through her hand and her back. As she is dying, she confesses all this to Marius and gives him a letter from Cosette. Her final request to Marius is that once she has passed, he will kiss her on the forehead. He fulfills her request not because of romantic feelings on his part, but out of pity for her hard life.
* Monsieur Thénardier and Madame Thénardier (also known as the Jondrettes, M. Fabantou, M. Thénard. Some translations identify her as &quot;the Thenardiess&quot;) – Husband and wife, parents of five children: two daughters, Éponine and Azelma, and three sons, Gavroche and two unnamed younger sons. As innkeepers, they abuse Cosette as a child and extort payment from Fantine for her support, until Valjean takes Cosette away. They become bankrupt and relocate under the name Jondrette to a house in Paris called the Gorbeau House, living in the room next to Marius. The husband associates with a criminal group called Patron-Minette and conspires to rob Valjean until he is thwarted by Marius. Javert arrests the couple. The wife dies in prison. Her husband attempts to blackmail Marius with his knowledge of Valjean&#x27;s past, but Marius pays him to leave the country and he becomes a slave trader in the United States.
* Gavroche – The unloved middle child and eldest son of the Thénardiers. He lives on his own as a street urchin and sleeps inside an elephant statue outside the Bastille. He briefly takes care of his two younger brothers, unaware they are related to him. He takes part in the barricades and is killed while collecting bullets from dead National Guardsmen.
* Bishop Myriel – The Bishop of Digne (full name Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel, also called Monseigneur Bienvenu) – A kindly old priest promoted to bishop after a chance encounter with Napoleon. After Valjean steals some silver from him, he saves him from being arrested and inspires him to change his ways.

* Courfeyrac – A law student described as the centre of the group of Friends. He is honorable, warm, and Marius&#x27;s closest companion.
* Enjolras – The leader of the Friends in the Paris uprising. A resolute and charismatic youth, he is passionately committed to republican principles and the idea of progress. He and Grantaire are executed by the National Guards after the barricade falls.
* Feuilly – An orphaned fan maker and passionate Polonophile who taught himself to read and write. He is the only member of the Friends who is not a student.
* Grantaire (also &quot;R&quot;) – A drunk with little interest in revolution. Despite his pessimism, he eventually declares himself a believer in the Republic and dies alongside Enjolras, whom he reveres.
* Jean Prouvaire (also Jehan) – A Romantic with knowledge of Italian, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew and an interest in the Middle Ages
* Joly – A medical student who has unusual theories about health. He is a hypochondriac and is described as the happiest of the Friends.
* Lesgle (also Lègle, Laigle, L&#x27;Aigle [&quot;The Eagle&quot;], or Bossuet) – The oldest member of the group. Considered notoriously unlucky, Lesgle begins balding at the age of twenty-five. It is Lesgle who introduces Marius to the Friends.

===Minor===
* Azelma – The younger daughter of the Thénardiers. Like her sister, Éponine, she is spoiled as a child and impoverished when older. She abets her father&#x27;s failed robbery of Valjean. On Marius and Cosette&#x27;s wedding day, she tails Valjean on her father&#x27;s orders. She travels to America with her father at the end of the novel.

* Brevet – An ex-convict from Toulon who knew Valjean there; released one year after Valjean. In 1823, he is serving time in the prison in Arras for an unknown crime. He is the first to claim that Champmathieu is really Valjean. He used to wear knitted, checkered suspenders.
* Brujon – A robber and criminal. He participates in crimes with M. Thénardier and the Patron-Minette gang (such as the Gorbeau robbery and the attempted robbery at the Rue Plumet). The author describes Brujon as being &quot;a sprightly young fellow, very cunning and very adroit, with a flurried and plaintive appearance&quot;.
* Champmathieu – A vagabond who is misidentified as Valjean after being caught stealing apples
* Chenildieu – A lifer from Toulon. He and Valjean were chain mates for five years. He once tried to unsuccessfully remove his lifer&#x27;s brand TFP (&quot;travaux forcés à perpetuité&quot;, &quot;forced labour for life&quot;) by putting his shoulder on a chafing dish full of embers. He is described as a small, wiry but energetic man.

* Colonel Georges Pontmercy – Marius&#x27;s father and an officer in Napoleon&#x27;s army. Wounded at Waterloo, Pontmercy erroneously believes M. Thénardier saved his life. He tells Marius of this great debt. He loves Marius, and although M. Gillenormand does not allow him to visit, he continually hides behind a pillar in the church on Sunday so that he can at least look at Marius from a distance. Napoleon made him a baron, but the next regime refuses to recognize his barony or his status as a colonel, instead referring to him only as a commandant.

* Favourite – A young grisette in Paris and leader of Fantine&#x27;s group of seamstress friends (including Zéphine and Dahlia). She is independent and well versed in the ways of the world and had previously been in England.

* Gillenormand, Mademoiselle – Daughter of M. Gillenormand, with whom she lives. Her late half sister (M. Gillenormand&#x27;s daughter from another marriage), was Marius&#x27;s mother.
* Gillenormand, Monsieur – Marius&#x27;s grandfather. A monarchist, he disagrees sharply with Marius on political issues, and they have several arguments. He attempts to keep Marius from being influenced by his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy. While in perpetual conflict with him over ideas, he holds his grandson in affection.
* Théodule Gillenormand – Army officer and Marius&#x27;s cousin. He makes a half-hearted and unsuccessful attempt at supplanting Marius in the affections of their grandfather.
* Listolier – A wealthy student in Paris originally from Cahors. He is a friend of Félix Tholomyès and becomes romantically involved with Fantine&#x27;s friend Dahlia.
* Mabeuf – An elderly churchwarden and friend of Colonel Pontmercy, who after the Colonel&#x27;s death befriends his son, Marius, and helps him realize his father loved him. Mabeuf loves plants and books but sells his books and prints in order to pay for a friend&#x27;s medical care. When Mabeuf finds a purse in his yard, he takes it to the police. After selling his last book, he joins the students in the insurrection. He is shot dead raising the flag atop the barricade.
* Magloire, Madame – Domestic servant to Bishop Myriel and his sister
* Magnon – Former servant of M. Gillenormand and friend of the Thénardiers. She had been receiving child support payments from M. Gillenormand for her two illegitimate sons, who she claims were fathered by him. When her sons die in an epidemic, she has them replaced with the Thénardiers&#x27; two youngest sons so that she can protect her income. The Thénardiers get a portion of the payments. She is incorrectly arrested for involvement in the Gorbeau robbery.
* Mother Innocente (aka Marguerite de Blemeur) – The prioress of the Petit-Picpus convent
* Patron-Minette – A quartet of bandits who assist in the Thénardiers&#x27; ambush of Valjean at the Gorbeau House and the attempted robbery at the Rue Plumet. The gang consists of Montparnasse, Claquesous, Babet, and Gueulemer. Claquesous, who escapes from the carriage transporting him to prison after the Gorbeau robbery, joins the revolution under the guise of &quot;Le Cabuc&quot; and is executed by Enjolras for firing on civilians.
* Petit Gervais – A travelling Savoyard boy who drops a coin. Valjean, still a man of criminal mind, places his foot on the coin and refuses to return it.
* Sister Simplice – A famously truthful nun who cares for Fantine on her sickbed and lies to Javert to protect Valjean.
* Félix Tholomyès – Fantine&#x27;s lover and Cosette&#x27;s biological father. A wealthy, self-centered student in Paris originally from Toulouse, he eventually abandons Fantine when their daughter is two years old.
* Toussaint – Valjean and Cosette&#x27;s servant in Paris. She has a slight stutter.

===The narrator===
Hugo does not give the narrator a name and allows the reader to identify the narrator with the novel&#x27;s author. The narrator occasionally injects himself into the narrative or reports facts outside the time of the narrative to emphasize that he is recounting historical events, not entirely fiction. He introduces his recounting of Waterloo with several paragraphs describing the narrator&#x27;s recent approach to the battlefield: &quot;Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles ...&quot; The narrator describes how &quot;[a]n observer, a dreamer, the author of this book&quot; during the 1832 street fighting was caught in the crossfire: &quot;All that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour.&quot; At one point, he apologizes for intruding—&quot;The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself&quot;—to ask the reader&#x27;s understanding when he describes &quot;the Paris of his youth ... as though it still existed&quot;. This introduces a meditation on memories of past places that his contemporary readers would recognize as a self-portrait written from exile: &quot;You have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.&quot; He describes another occasion when a bullet shot &quot;pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended ... over a hairdresser&#x27;s shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of the market.&quot; As evidence of police double agents at the barricades, he writes, &quot;The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.&quot;

==Contemporary reception==
The appearance of the novel was a highly anticipated event, as Victor Hugo was considered one of France&#x27;s foremost poets in the middle of the nineteenth century. &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced its forthcoming publication as early as April 1860. Hugo forbade his publishers from summarizing his story and refused to authorize the publication of excerpts in advance of publication. He instructed them to build on his earlier success and suggested this approach: &quot;What Victor H. did for the Gothic world in &quot;Notre-Dame of Paris&quot; [&quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;], he accomplishes for the modern world in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;&quot;. A massive advertising campaign preceded the release of the first two volumes of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in Brussels on 30 or 31 March and in Paris on 3 April 1862. The remaining volumes appeared on 15 May 1862.

Critical reactions were wide-ranging and often negative. Some critics found the subject matter immoral, others complained of its excessive sentimentality, and others were disquieted by its apparent sympathy with the revolutionaries. L. Gauthier wrote in &quot;Le Monde&quot; on 17 August 1862, &quot;One cannot read without an unconquerable disgust all the details Monsieur Hugo gives regarding the successful planning of riots.&quot; The Goncourt brothers judged the novel artificial and disappointing. Flaubert found &quot;neither truth nor greatness&quot; in it. He complained that the characters were crude stereotypes who all &quot;speak very well – but all in the same way&quot;. He deemed it an &quot;infantile&quot; effort and brought an end to Hugo&#x27;s career like &quot;the fall of a god&quot;. In a newspaper review, Charles Baudelaire praised Hugo&#x27;s success in focusing public attention on social problems, though he believed that such propaganda was the opposite of art. In private, he castigated it as &quot;repulsive and inept&quot; (&quot;immonde et inepte&quot;).

The work was a commercial success and has been a popular book ever since it was published. Translated the same year it appeared into several foreign languages, including Italian, Greek, and Portuguese, it proved popular not only in France but across Europe and abroad.

==English translations==

* Translator identified as &quot;A.F.&quot; Richmond, Virginia, 1863. Published by West and Johnston publishers. The Editor&#x27;s Preface announces its intention of correcting errors in Wilbour&#x27;s translation. It said that some passages &quot;exclusively intended for the French readers of the book&quot; were being omitted, as well as &quot;[a] few scattered sentences reflecting on slavery&quot; because &quot;the absence of a few antislavery paragraphs will hardly be complained of by Southern readers.&quot; Because of paper shortages in wartime, the passages omitted became longer with each successive volume.
* Isabel Florence Hapgood. Published 1887, this translation is available at Project Gutenberg.
* Norman Denny. Folio Press, 1976. A modern British translation later re-published in paperback by Penguin Books, . The translator explains in an introduction that he has placed two of the novel&#x27;s longer digressive passages into appendices and made some minor abridgements in the text.

===Sequels===
* Laura Kalpakian&#x27;s &quot;Cosette: The Sequel to Les Misérables&quot; was published in 1995. It continues the story of Cosette and Marius but is more a sequel to the musical than to the original novel.
* In 2001, two French novels by that continue Hugo&#x27;s story appeared: &quot;Cosette ou le temps des illusions&quot; and &quot;Marius ou le fugitif&quot;. The former has been published in an English translation. Javert appears as a hero who survived his suicide attempt and becomes religious; Thénardier returns from America; Marius is unjustly imprisoned. The works were the subject of an unsuccessful lawsuit, &quot;Société Plon et autres v. Pierre Hugo et autres&quot;, brought by Hugo&#x27;s great-great-grandson.

<text>Les Misérables is a 1935 American drama film starring Fredric March and Charles Laughton based upon the 1862 Victor Hugo novel of the same name. The movie was adapted by W. P. Lipscomb and directed by Richard Boleslawski. This was the last film for Twentieth Century Pictures before it merged with Fox Film Corporation to form 20th Century-Fox. The plot of the film mostly follows Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, but there are many differences.

The film was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture, the Academy Award for Best Assistant Director, the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. The National Board of Review named the film the sixth best of 1935.

==Plot==
==Cast==

* Fredric March as Jean Valjean/Champmathieu
* Charles Laughton as Inspector Émile Javert
* Cedric Hardwicke as Bishop Myriel
* Rochelle Hudson as Cosette
* Marilyn Knowlden as Young Cosette
* Florence Eldridge as Fantine
* John Beal as Marius
* Frances Drake as Éponine
* Ferdinand Gottschalk and Jane Kerr as the Thénardiers
* Vernon Downing as Brissac
* Leonid Kinskey as Genflou 
* Ian Maclaren as Head Gardener
* John Carradine as Enjolras
* Heinie Conklin as Drunk at Inn (uncredited) 
* Harry Cording as Beam Warder (uncredited)
* Olaf Hytten as Pierre (uncredited)

==Differences from the novel==
This adaptation made a lot of changes, many of which can also be found in later adaptations:
* Valjean&#x27;s trial, life as a convict and release are presented chronologically, whereas in the novel, his previous life is presented in flashback. In addition, the novel begins by introducing the bishop, while in the film, he does not appear until Valjean arrives at his door.
* The film begins with Valjean being sentenced in 1800, for ten years, rather than in 1796, for five years.
* While the word &quot;galleys&quot; was still used until the late 19th century to designate the French Bagnios, the actual penalty of sending someone to the galleys was abolished in mid-18th century. The galleys portrayed in this film are an anachronism.
* In the film, Javert is shown being assigned to the galleys and seeing Valjean&#x27;s display of strength at the beginning. In the novel, he is not introduced until after Valjean has become mayor.
* Javert&#x27;s first name is given as Émile, while in the novel, it is never given.
* In the film, Valjean&#x27;s prison number is 2906, while in the novel it is 24601.
* In the novel, Javert is described as a tall man, with a small head, sunken eyes, large sideburns and long hair hanging over his eyes, which differs greatly from Charles Laughton&#x27;s appearance, and his version of Javert in the film wears different clothes than in the novel.
* Valjean is released after the 10-year sentence, despite mention of an escape attempt. In the novel he spends 19 years in prison, having been given extra time for trying to escape. He still receives a yellow passport, branding him a violent man for his attempts, however.
* In the film, there is no mention of Fantine selling her hair and teeth, or becoming a prostitute, to afford her payments to the Thénardiers. When she confronts Valjean, she does appear to be dressed like a prostitute, but neither Valjean nor Javert make any reference to her clothing.
* In the film, Valjean brings Cosette to Fantine before Fantine dies, while in the novel, Cosette does not meet her mother again, and is not informed of her mother&#x27;s identity or fate until Valjean is on his own deathbed at the end of the novel.
* The Thénardiers&#x27; inn is called &quot;The Sergeant at Waterloo&quot; in the novel, but is called &quot;The Brave Sergeant&quot; in the film.
* In the novel, Valjean pays Thénardier 1,500 francs to settle Fantine&#x27;s debts and takes Cosette; the Thénardiers appear in Paris several years later. No discussion regarding Valjean&#x27;s intentions takes place in the film; after speaking with Cosette alone, Valjean is seen riding away with her and the Thénardiers are not seen again.
* In the novel, only three prisoners (Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille) identify Champmathieu as being Valjean in court. The film adds a fourth convict, Genflou, to the witnesses.
* In the film, Valjean and Cosette go to the convent with a letter of introduction from M. Madeleine, whereas in the novel, they came upon the convent coincidentally while fleeing from Javert.
* Valjean rescues a man whose cart had fallen on him, which arouses Javert&#x27;s suspicion, but the film does not mention that this man (Fauchelevent) and the gardener at the convent are the same person.
* Marius meets Valjean and Cosette while they ride into the park where he is giving a speech, while in the novel he is simply walking in the Luxembourg Garden when he sees them.
* Éponine&#x27;s role is changed from the novel. In the film, she is the secretary of the revolutionary society Marius belongs to. In the novel, she is the Thénardiers&#x27; daughter, and is not connected to the revolutionary society. The film makes no mention of her being the Thénardiers&#x27; daughter.
* Gavroche is cut entirely.
* In the novel, Enjolras is the leader of the revolutionaries and Marius is not even a very faithful follower (him being a Bonapartist with different ideas than his friends). In the film, Marius is the leader. In addition, the students&#x27; goal is not a democracy but to better the conditions in the French galleys. 
* In the film, Éponine delivers the message from Marius to Cosette, which Valjean intercepts, causing Valjean to come to the barricade to rescue Marius. In the novel, Gavroche delivers it.
* In the film, Javert pursues Valjean and Marius into the sewers, which he does not in the novel, although he does meet Valjean when he exits the sewers, having pursued Thénardier there.
* Valjean brings Marius to Valjean&#x27;s house and Cosette, while in the novel, Valjean brings Marius to the house of Marius&#x27; grandfather M. Gillenormand, who does not appear in the film. Also, while Valjean thinks Javert is waiting for him and he is going away, he gives Marius and Cosette instructions, including to love each other always and leaving the candlesticks to Cosette, which in the novel appear in his deathbed scene.
* In the film, Valjean hides the fact that he expects Javert to arrest him by reiterating to Cosette and Marius his plan to move to England.
* The film ends with Javert&#x27;s suicide, while at the end of the novel, Valjean dies of grief after having been separated from Cosette, because Marius severed all ties with him after learning of Valjean&#x27;s convict past, but both arrive to see him before he dies.

<text>Jean Valjean () is the protagonist of Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1862 novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. The story depicts the character&#x27;s struggle to lead a normal life and redeem himself after serving a 19-year-long prison sentence for stealing bread to feed his sister&#x27;s starving children and attempting to escape from prison. Valjean is also known in the novel as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent (once called Tranchelevent by Monsieur Gillenormand), Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre.

Jean Valjean and police Inspector Javert, who repeatedly encounters Valjean and attempts to return him to prison, have become archetypes in literary culture.

== Outline of the novel ==

As a parolee, Valjean is issued a yellow passport with marching orders to Pontarlier, where he will be forced to live under severe restrictions. This document, often called a &quot;passeport jaune&quot; (yellow passport), identifies him to all as a former convict and immediately brands Valjean an outcast wherever he travels. His life turns around when Bishop Myriel of Digne, from whom he steals valuable silverware, tells the police that he has given the treasure to Valjean. Out of this encounter, Valjean becomes a repentant, honorable, and dignified man. He becomes kind, a devoted father-figure to a girl, Cosette, who loses her mother, and a benefactor to those in need.

Although a known criminal and a parolee, Valjean yet grows morally to represent the best traits of humanity. Bishop Myriel tells him in Volume I that &quot;if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts of good-will and of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us.&quot; A few books later Victor Hugo describes that &quot;[w]hat the Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out. It was more than a transformation; it was a transfiguration [...][he had] henceforth only two thoughts,—to conceal his name and to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.&quot; Whenever Valjean&#x27;s desire to remain concealed conflicts with his desire to sanctify his life, &quot;[he] d[oes] not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second—his security to his virtue.&quot; By the end of the novel, even the police officer Inspector Javert acknowledges that Valjean is &quot;kneeling on the heights of virtue, more nearly akin to an angel than to a man.&quot;

His character foil, the police officer Inspector Javert, persecutes him throughout the novel. After Valjean saves his life, Inspector Javert is forced to reconsider the authoritarian worldview he has adopted all his life; there &quot;takes place in him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legal affirmation, his only standard of measurement hitherto. (...) justice according to God, running in an inverse sense to justice according to men.&quot; This revelation that &quot;authority might be put out of countenance, that the rule might be inadequate in the presence of a fact, that everything could not be framed within the text of the code&quot; leads to his eventual suicide.

== In the novel ==
=== Part One: Fantine ===
Victor Hugo devotes the novel&#x27;s first book to Bishop Myriel, a kind-hearted old clergyman in the town of Digne. The second book opens with the arrival of a stranger to the town of Digne, who is gradually revealed to be the ex-convict Jean Valjean. He searches for a place to stay the night and is repeatedly turned away because of his yellow passport, which marks him as a criminal. At last, he is taken in by the bishop, who trusts him, feeds him supper, and gives him a bed for the night.

Hugo then details Valjean&#x27;s background. He was born sometime in 1769 in a small town and orphaned as a child. He became a pruner and helped support his widowed sister and her seven children. In the winter of 1795, when resources were scarce, Valjean stole a loaf of bread from a local baker by breaking the window. He was caught and imprisoned for five years in the Bagne of Toulon. He attempted to escape three times, and each time his sentence was lengthened by three years; he also received an extra two years for once resisting recapture during his second escape. After nineteen years in prison, he was released, but by law must carry a yellow passport that announces he is an ex-convict.

During the night, he awakens and steals the bishop&#x27;s silverware and silver plates, and runs off. He is arrested and brought back to the bishop. However, the Bishop admonishes Valjean (in front of the police) for forgetting to also take the silver candlesticks that he&#x27;d given Valjean, reminding Valjean of his &quot;promise&quot; to use the silver to become an honest man, claiming to have bought Valjean&#x27;s soul with it, withdrawing it from evil and giving it to God. Despite the Bishop&#x27;s words, it is later revealed that the police marked the event down in Valjean&#x27;s permanent record.

Bewildered and not understanding what the bishop is talking about, Valjean heads back out into the nearby mountains and meets a young traveling worker from Savoy named Petit Gervais. Valjean places his foot on a coin that Petit Gervais drops, then refuses to return it, despite Gervais&#x27; protests, and threatens to beat him. When the boy flees the scene and Valjean comes to his senses, remembering what the bishop told him, he is ashamed of what he has done and searches for the boy in vain.

Hugo introduces Fantine and explains how she came to be abandoned by her child&#x27;s father. In late 1815, Valjean, now using the name Madeleine, arrives in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He revolutionizes the town&#x27;s manufacturing and earns a fortune, which he spends mostly for the town&#x27;s good, paying for the maintenance (including required staff) of hospital beds, orphanages and schools. He is appointed mayor after refusing the first time. He declines the king&#x27;s offer to make him a Knight of the Legion of Honor.

Madeleine (Valjean) saves an old man named Fauchelevent from death. Fauchelevent had fallen beneath his wagon as his horse fell and broke two of its legs. Madeleine offers to pay anyone who could raise the wagon but nobody wants to risk his life climbing under the wagon. Madeleine turns pale, but gets down into the mud and lifts the wagon off Fauchelevent. Javert, who witnessed the scene, tells Madeleine that he had only known of one man capable of doing such a feat, and that was a convict doing forced labor in Toulon. Since Fauchelevent had earlier lost his business and now had a broken kneecap, Madeleine (Valjean) arranges a job at a convent for Fauchelevent. Valjean also buys the broken cart and horse as an excuse to give Fauchelevent money.

Later, Javert arrests Fantine, who has become a prostitute, when he sees her scratch and try to hit a bourgeois named Bamatabois, who had taunted Fantine and thrown snow down her dress while she walked back and forth trying to get business. Valjean was told what had happened and knew that Bamatabois should have been the one arrested and ordered Fantine free. Javert knew only what he&#x27;d seen and was furious with Valjean for interfering with police work. When Valjean orders Javert to leave in front of Javert&#x27;s squad, Javert leaves and denounces &quot;Madeleine&quot; to the prefect of police at Paris, saying that he suspects Madeleine is Valjean. Javert is told that he must be incorrect because the &quot;real&quot; Jean Valjean (who is in reality Champmathieu) had just been found.

Valjean takes Fantine to the local hospital (which is on the side of the mayor&#x27;s house) and has her cared for. He learns of Cosette, Fantine&#x27;s daughter, and tries to pay off the Thénardiers (who are abusing Cosette).

Javert then apologizes to &quot;M. Madeleine&quot;, and tells him that the &quot;real&quot; Jean Valjean has been found and is to be tried the next day. Javert also asks that he be dismissed in disgrace by Valjean from his job for acting out of revenge incorrectly, saying that since he had been hard on others he could not be less harsh on himself but after Valjean repeatedly refuses, Javert says he will continue acting as police chief until a replacement can be found.

It is only here that the novel finally reveals Madeleine to be Valjean, a fact which was heavily foreshadowed before.
That night, Valjean has a terrific struggle within himself, but finally decides to go to the trial and reveal his identity in order to free Champmathieu (for, if he gave himself up, who would care for Fantine or rescue Cosette?). He gives his evidence and proves that he is the real Jean Valjean, but nobody wants to arrest him, so Valjean says that they know where to find him and he returns to Montreuil-sur-Mer. The judge at the trial, although quite impressed with M. Madeleine&#x27;s work and reputation, is shocked that Valjean, while mentioning a date that another convict had tattooed on himself (in order to prove that M. Madeleine was actually Jean Valjean) called Napoleon Bonaparte &quot;the Emperor&quot; instead of &quot;Bonaparte&quot; and orders Valjean arrested for robbing Petit Gervais. Javert comes to arrest him the next day while Valjean is in Fantine&#x27;s room. Valjean asks for three days to get Cosette from Montfermeil and give her to Fantine before he is arrested and Javert refuses, saying that it would be too easy for Valjean to escape. Fantine (who&#x27;d been told by the doctors that Valjean, who&#x27;d been at the trial, had been getting her daughter) was shocked to find that her daughter was not there already and that her savior was being arrested, and died of shock (her body had been greatly weakened by her poor living conditions and long illness, probably tuberculosis).

Valjean allows Javert to arrest him, but quickly escapes. It is hinted that Valjean escaped with the help of a file hidden in a coin, an item he is later proved to possess. Valjean returns to his house to pack his clothes and hides behind the door when Javert comes looking for him. Sister Simplice, one of the hospital nuns, who had a reputation for never having told a lie in her life, twice lied to Javert that there was nobody there but her to protect Valjean. Javert believed her and left, giving Valjean an opportunity to escape the town.

=== Part Two: Cosette ===

A short chapter, mainly consisting of two newspaper articles, informs the reader that Valjean has been re-arrested while getting into the stagecoach to Montfermeil (on his way to get Fantine&#x27;s eight-year-old daughter, Cosette, whom he had promised to rescue). In July 1823, he was condemned to death for the 40-sous theft and the escape from the jail in Montreuil-sur-Mer, as the prosecutor claims that Valjean was part of a gang of street robbers and the latter refuses to defend himself. His sentence was graciously reduced by the king to only life in prison instead of death. Before he was captured, Valjean had already traveled near to Montfermeil and buried all the money he&#x27;d saved as M. Madeleine—a chapter tells of a worker in Montfermeil, a former Toulon convict, who claims having seen, according to a local fairy tale, the devil burying his treasure in the forest. No further explanation is ever given as to why, having buried his money near Montfermeil, Valjean had traveled back to Paris and then attempted to travel back to Montfermeil.

Valjean was assigned a new number of 9430, but escapes from a sailing vessel after only a few months&#x27; imprisonment, on 16 November 1823, by apparently falling into the sea after a daring rescue of a sailor who had gotten stuck in a dangerous situation up in the ship&#x27;s rigging. Thereafter he is officially presumed dead.

Valjean goes to Montfermeil, where he meets Cosette alone in the forest on Christmas Eve, 1823. He accompanies her back to the inn; and watches that evening as the Thénardiers mistreat her very badly. He sees the Thénardiers&#x27; daughters Éponine and Azelma acting unkindly to her as well, tattling on her to their mother when she tries to play with their temporarily abandoned doll. After seeing this, Valjean briefly leaves the inn and returns with a beautiful new doll to give to Cosette, which she happily accepts. This makes Mme. Thénardier furious with Valjean, affronted that he would do such a thing for Cosette instead of her own daughters. M. Thénardier tells her that Valjean can do as he wishes as long as he pays them. That evening, Mme. Thénardier insists that Cosette will be turned out onto the street the next day.

The next morning, Christmas Day, Valjean offers to take Cosette with him. Mme. Thénardier immediately accepts, but M. Thénardier haggles for a compensation and gets 1500 francs in the end. Valjean takes Cosette with him. Only now does the book confirm that the mysterious man Cosette met is actually Valjean. M. Thénardier is soon overcome with grief at having sold Cosette too cheaply and runs after them. When M. Thénardier demands more money, Valjean gives him the note Fantine signed before she died, saying that the bearer of the note was authorized to take Cosette. M. Thénardier tries to continue following Valjean, but is soon frightened back to the inn.

Valjean takes Cosette to Paris, where they live in No. 50-52 Boulevard de l&#x27;Hôpital, in the so-called &quot;Gorbeau House&quot;. They cannot live calmly for long—in Spring 1824, Javert, who has been promoted to the police in Paris, finds the house. He has heard of a &quot;kidnapping&quot; from Montfermeil and remembers Valjean&#x27;s request of three days. He has also heard of a man, poorly dressed, who gives money to other poor people, the &quot;beggar who gives alms&quot;, who had a granddaughter with him and who has been heard to say that she came from Montfermeil. Javert goes undercover, discovers that it is Valjean, and makes plans to arrest him.

Valjean recognizes Javert, and taking Cosette, walks out of the house and leaves. They barely manage to get away from Javert, who allowed Valjean to leave the house, believing that Valjean would take him to meet other criminals. Valjean managed to steal a rope from a streetlamp, climb a wall to a convent and pull Cosette up after him. They then climbed down a shed roof into a garden. it turned out that this was the convent where Fauchelevent worked, who wanted to return the favor and save Valjean&#x27;s life this time. After almost burying Valjean alive in a scheme to get him out of the convent so that he could openly walk back into the convent, Fauchelevent was able to bring in his &quot;brother&quot; Ultimas (fr. Ultime) Fauchelevent (the real name of Fauchelevent&#x27;s deceased brother). Cosette was admitted to the convent school.

=== Part Three: Marius ===

During this whole part, Valjean and Cosette are unnamed, as the action is seen from Marius Pontmercy&#x27;s point of view. They are described only as a father and daughter, whom Marius notices on his daily walks in the Jardin du Luxembourg. He ignores them at first, but later he and Cosette fall in love. Marius stalks the two until Valjean is alerted that someone is stalking them and moves from his house in Rue de l&#x27;Ouest (today Rue d&#x27;Assas).

They meet again by pure luck, six months later: Valjean is known for his generosity. As &quot;the generous man from the St-Étienne-church&quot;, Thénardier, Marius&#x27; neighbour, asks for charity. He recognises Valjean and decides to build a trap for him. Marius, overhearing the plans, denounces the plot to the police, unfortunately meeting Javert. Valjean walks right into the trap and attempts to escape Thénardier once he realizes this. Thénardier forces Valjean to write a letter to Cosette, instructing her to come with the bearer. Valjean, however, gives Thénardier a false name and address and manages to free himself of the ropes tying him with the help of a file concealed in a hollowed-out coin, which is found afterwards. He berates the gang for thinking that they could force him to tell something he does not want to tell and burns his own left forearm with the poker Thénardier had used to threaten him before surrendering to the gang. It is at that moment that Javert enters the scene. There are a lot of people and confusion in the room, and the room is dimly lit allowing Valjean to escape through an open window before Javert recognizes him.

=== Part Four: Saint-Denis ===

Only now is when Valjean&#x27;s and Cosette&#x27;s life during the last years revealed: They lived in the convent until Fauchelevent&#x27;s death, and left in 1829; Cosette is fourteen years old. Valjean buys three houses (so that he will always have somewhere to flee to) in Rue de l&#x27;Ouest (today Rue D&#x27;Assas), Rue Plumet (today Rue Oudinot) and No. 7 Rue de l&#x27;Homme-Armé (today 40, rue des Archives), mostly living in Rue Plumet.

Valjean does not know that Cosette returns Marius&#x27; love and does not understand why Cosette seems less attached to &quot;her grandfather&quot; than before. He is happy to see that the brand wound he got during the attack makes her worry and care for him more. During one of their walks, they witness the passing of a chain gang being taken from Paris south. The event leaves a profound impression on Cosette and makes Valjean even more determined to stop his ward from learning about his past.

Marius, through Éponine, finds Cosette, stalks her house, leaves his daily love journal for her to find then one evening leaps over the gate and surprises her in the garden. They begin meeting every evening to gaze into each other&#x27;s eyes. But it is also Éponine, jealous, who throws Valjean an anonymous note, telling him to move. Valjean, feeling threatened since the incident with Thénardier and since he believes there has been a man hiding in his garden, decides to move to England. He takes Cosette to the house in the Rue de l&#x27;Homme-Armé. This takes places during the first days of June 1832.

It is only there that he learns of Cosette&#x27;s love for Marius when a young boy (Gavroche) delivers a letter from Marius to Cosette, which mentions that Marius is at the barricade and will die as he promised her, since she left without a forwarding address. Valjean has another long inward struggle, at first feeling relief about Marius&#x27; certain death, then guilt about his former feeling. He joins the rebellion without an actual decision about his following actions.

=== Part Five: Valjean ===

Valjean plays his part in the insurrection and proves an excellent shot. To thank him, Enjolras, the barricade&#x27;s leader, offers him anything he wants. Valjean asks that he be allowed to kill Javert, who has been captured as a spy. The request is granted and Valjean takes Javert out of sight to kill him but instead of executing him, sets him free, though Javert warns that he will still be bound to arrest Valjean. Valjean agrees and gives Javert his address. After Valjean releases Javert, the fighters on the barricades are all killed with the exception of Marius, whom Valjean carries to safety through miles of Parisian sewers. Valjean finds the sewer exit to the Grand-Caillou locked. Thénardier is there and has the key. He offers Valjean the key in return for payment, believing that Valjean had killed Marius for his money. Valjean gives the few sous he has to Thénardier and unlocks the sewer gate. He encounters Javert, now returned to duty and in pursuit of Thénardier. Valjean requests that Javert help him carry Marius to safety and Javert summons his carriage. Valjean asks permission to return home to say goodbye to Cosette and Javert agrees, saying that he will wait out front. As he walks up the stairs, Valjean looks out the window and notices that Javert is gone. Javert confronts his life spent in pursuit of a criminal who has demonstrated a sense of justice outside of the one that Javert has upheld his entire life. Unable to accept this, he commits suicide.

After recovering from his injuries, Marius receives permission from his grandfather to marry Cosette and they wed. The day after the wedding, Valjean reveals to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius, horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean&#x27;s character and begins pushing him out of Cosette&#x27;s life. After this, Valjean&#x27;s previously habitual visits to Cosette at Marius&#x27; grandfather&#x27;s house become shorter and shorter, until he ceases to visit at all, having become bedridden with loss of will to live. Some time after he stops coming, Thénardier visits Marius and claims that Valjean is a murderer and shows Marius several newspaper articles to prove this. Marius sees through Thénardier&#x27;s disguise and, in an attempt to show Marius something that he does not already know, Thénardier shows newspaper clippings proving that M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean are the same person, and that Javert committed suicide. Marius is then told that Valjean was the man who had &quot;assassinated&quot; one of Marius&#x27; relatives, carrying the body through the sewers on 6 June. Realizing that Thénardier had seen Valjean saving him, Marius finishes with Thénardier and hurries with Cosette to Valjean&#x27;s flat. Unfortunately, they are too late and find Valjean is dying. Valjean makes peace with Marius, with whom he had uneasy relations, and tells Cosette the name of her mother, Fantine. He dies content, under the light of the Bishop&#x27;s candlesticks, and it is stated that an angel awaits to carry his soul to Heaven. He is buried in an unmarked grave, per his request, after death. An unknown person writes in pencil these four lines on the gravestone:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Il dort. Quoique le sort fût pour lui bien étrange,&quot;
&quot;Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n&#x27;eut plus son ange;&quot;
&quot;La chose simplement d&#x27;elle-même arriva,&quot;
&quot;Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s&#x27;en va.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Translation:
He sleeps. Although his fate was very strange, 
He lived. He died when he no longer had his angel. 
The thing came to pass simply, of itself, 
As the night comes when day is gone.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Hugo&#x27;s sources==

Valjean&#x27;s character is loosely based on the life of Eugène François Vidocq, an ex-convict who became a successful businessman widely noted for his social engagement and philanthropy. Vidocq helped Hugo with his research for Claude Gueux and &quot;Le Dernier jour d&#x27;un condamné&quot; (&quot;The Last Day of a Condemned Man&quot;). In 1828, Vidocq saved one of the workers in his paper factory by lifting a heavy cart on his shoulders as Valjean does. Hugo&#x27;s description of Valjean rescuing a sailor on the &quot;Orion&quot; drew almost word for word on a friend&#x27;s letter describing such an incident. On 22 February 1846, when he had begun work on the novel, Hugo witnessed the arrest of a bread thief while a duchess and her child watched the scene pitilessly from their coach.

The revolt of the university students is based on the 1832 June Rebellion.

In 1871, when Hugo was living in Brussels during the radical revolt known as the Paris Commune, anti-revolutionary mobs attacked his house and broke windows shouting &quot;Down with Jean Valjean!&quot;

== Musical ==
Les Misérables became an Award Winning musical in London, 1985.

===Differences in the musical===

* Javert frequently refers to Jean Valjean as &quot;Prisoner 24601&quot;, which never happens in the book. The number appears only twice in the novel, and is never spoken by Javert. It is only the first prison code of Valjean in the novel, but his only code in the musical. It was chosen by Victor Hugo when he believed that he was conceived on 24 June 1801 (that is, 24-6-01).
* Valjean&#x27;s assumed name, Monsieur Madeleine, is used in the original French language concept album, but not in the later English version of the musical, where he is only called &quot;Monsieur le maire&quot; (Mr. Mayor). In the 2012 film adaptation of the musical, the factory foreman breaks up the fight between Fantine and the factory workers, announcing &quot;Monsieur Madeleine&#x27;s here!&quot;. The assumed name can also be seen on the door of his office.
* In the novel, Valjean is arrested for the second time after confessing to being a parole-breaker in court. Javert later chases him for escaping from prison. In the musical, Valjean neither gets arrested again nor escapes from prison.
* Valjean and Cosette do not live in Gorbeau House and take refuge from Javert in a convent in the musical version, but the 2012 movie depicts Valjean inadvertently entering the convent with Cosette while escaping Javert, where he then encounters Fauchelevent. The Gorbeau House episode with the Thenardiers is also omitted in the musical and film adaptation. Instead, Thenardier lures Valjean into a trap on the streets with his gang and later attempts to rob him in his house, which is located on Rue Plumet.
* In Act 2, &quot;The First Attack&quot;, Valjean shoots a sniper who is attempting to kill Enjolras. It is unclear in the musical (due to the sniper being off stage) whether Valjean actually shoots the sniper or if he shoots the sniper&#x27;s helmet to prevent him from killing Enjolras. In the novel, he shoots only at soldiers&#x27; helmets while at the barricade and purposely does not kill anyone.
* Valjean reveals his past to Marius before Marius and Cosette&#x27;s wedding, and he also does not attend it. In the book, he does attend the wedding and confesses to Marius afterwards.

Given the high range of the role, particularly in parts of Bring Him Home, Valjean is most often played by a tenor.

<doc id="61494" wikidata="Q1246938" url="?curid=61494" title="Naughty Marietta (film)">
<text>Naughty Marietta is a 1935 American romantic musical film based on the 1910 operetta of the same name by Victor Herbert. Jeanette MacDonald stars as a princess who flees an arranged marriage. She sails for New Orleans and is rescued from pirates by Captain Richard Warrington (Nelson Eddy). Five of Herbert&#x27;s most famous songs come from the score of &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;, with words by lyricist Rida Johnson Young: &quot;Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life&quot;, &quot;Italian Street Song&quot;, &quot;Neath the Southern Moon&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Falling in Love with Someone&quot; and &quot;Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! (Along the Highway)&quot;. Additional lyrics for several of Herbert&#x27;s songs were penned for the film by Gus Kahn. The film was written by Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, John Lee Mahin and Rida Johnson Young.

==Plot==
To avoid an arranged marriage to Don Carlos, an elderly Spanish duke, Princess Marie masquerades as her uncle&#x27;s former servant, Marietta, and escapes from France on a ship with casquette girls who are traveling to New Orleans to marry colonists. On board, Marietta befriends Julie.

En route, the women discuss what type of man they want to marry. &quot;Marietta&quot; shocks the other girls by stating that she does not intend to marry anyone. Shortly after, the ship is boarded by pirates, who kill the entire crew and take the girls ashore.

After the pirates divide the loot, they turn their attention to the girls. Just then, singing is heard (&quot;Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!&quot;). The pirates extinguish their torches and fire to try to avoid detection, but Marietta takes one of the torches and runs towards the sound of the singing, crying out &quot;help, help&quot;. Mercenaries rout the pirates and rescue the women.

The mercenaries&#x27; leader, Captain Richard Warrington, sings &quot;Neath a Southern Moon&quot; to Marietta. Despite his attraction to her, however, Warrington declares that he does not intend to marry.

Warrington and his men take the casquette girls to New Orleans, where they are welcomed by the governor. The women are housed in the convent while they get to know their potential husbands. When some men approach Marietta, she declares that she does not want to marry any of them. The governor feels that he has seen Marietta before in Paris, but she denies it. When she pretends to have a disreputable past, the governor orders a pair of soldiers to escort her away in disgrace. Warrington relieves them of their duty and finds her a place to stay, even paying the first month&#x27;s rent. Though Marietta tries to rid herself of Warrington, he is undaunted. Just then, a group of gypsies stroll by, advertising their Marionette Theater. The gypsy leader, Rodolpho, has his daughter sing, and Warrington joins in (&quot;Italian Street Song&quot;). Stung by Warrington&#x27;s remark that she might not be able to sing as well as the gypsy, Marietta surprises him by doing so beautifully. While he is distracted getting rid of three would-be suitors, she slips away.

The following day, Warrington discovers that Marietta is working at the Marionette Theater. When he visits her after the performance, he receives a warmer reception. Soon after, however, a large award is offered for information about her whereabouts. Warrington persuades her to trust him, and takes her away by boat. During this time together, they discover that they are falling in love with each other (&quot;I&#x27;m Falling in Love with Someone&quot;). Later, however, they are found by French soldiers, and her true identity is revealed. Her uncle and Don Carlos are expected on the next ship to take her back.

Marietta is to attend a ball arranged by the governor in her honor. Julie comes to see her; she tells Marietta that Warrington had been ordered to leave New Orleans that day, but intends to come to the ball. Her uncle warns her that &quot;if Warrington attempted to see her again, he would be arrested for treason and shot&quot;. Marietta asks Julie to stop Warrington from coming, but they realize it is too late when they hear him and his men singing (&quot;Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!&quot;).

When Warrington enters the ballroom, the governor tries to get him to leave in order to save his life. Marietta pretends to have been toying with him to deceive her uncle. As Warrington is leaving, Marietta sings &quot;Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life&quot;, joined by Warrington. The lovers then flee to the wild frontier.

<doc id="61497" wikidata="Q541348" url="?curid=61497" title="Southsea">
<text>Southsea is a seaside resort and a geographic area of Portsmouth, Portsea Island in the ceremonial county of Hampshire, England. Southsea is located 1.8 miles (2.8 km) to the south of Portsmouth&#x27;s inner city-centre. 

Southsea began as a fashionable 19th-century Victorian seaside resort named &quot;Croxton Town&quot;, after a Mr Croxton who owned the land. As the resort grew, it adopted the name of nearby Southsea Castle, a seafront fort constructed in 1544 to help defend the Solent and approaches to Portsmouth Harbour.

In 1879, South Parade Pier was opened by Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar in Southsea. The pier began operating a passenger steamer service across the Solent to the Isle of Wight. This service gave rise to the idea of linking Southsea and its pier to Portsmouth&#x27;s railway line, and for tourists to bypass the busy town of Portsmouth and its crowded harbour. East Southsea railway station, along with the Southsea Railway and Fratton railway station were jointly opened on 1 July 1885 by Lady Ada Mary Willis (née Neeld), wife of General Sir George Willis, the Lieutenant Governor of Portsmouth.

Southsea subsequently grew into a dense residential suburb and large, distinct commercial and entertainment area, separate from the town of Portsmouth up until Southsea and the whole of Portsea Island were incorporated into the town borough of Portsmouth in 1904.

Due to declining use and World War I, the Southsea Railway line and its East Southsea station were closed on 6 August 1914. To maintain Southsea&#x27;s tourism, the Southsea station name was moved and merged with Portsmouth&#x27;s main town centre railway station in 1925, officially becoming known as Portsmouth &amp; Southsea railway station. A year later in 1926, Portsmouth was granted official city status, while its main railway station retained its &quot;Portsmouth &amp; Southsea&quot; name, which has led many non-locals and visitors to wrongly assume that Southsea is still a separate town near to Portsmouth.

The areas of Southsea surrounding Albert Road, Palmerston Road, and Osborne Road contain many bars, restaurants and independent shops. Palmerston Road is the main High Street of Southsea and contains various shops and restaurants, as well as the local library, and Southsea Community Cinema and Arts Centre. Albert Road is a distinct street containing shopping and cultural venues, which include The Wedgewood Rooms, and the Kings Theatre, a regional theatre built in 1907.

Southsea retains its own post town status (PO4 and PO5), even though the actual town of Southsea was merged into Portsmouth in 1904.

==History==

The history of Southsea is generally part of the history of Portsmouth, as Southsea started with the growth of Portsmouth dockyard and of the city, with the expansion of British maritime power during the British Empire. Before the 16th century Southsea was principally composed of small farms, open grassland and undrained marshland (morass), outside the main naval base and the city itself. However the growing expectation of a possible French attack on the naval base led Henry VIII to order the building of Southsea Castle in 1544, adjacent to the channel approaches to Portsmouth Harbour. Southsea was first recorded as a place name in a Royal plan in 1577. Henry VIII visited Southsea Castle in 1545, from where he witnessed the sinking of the warship Mary Rose in the Solent.

The first references to the development of the suburb appear in the Portsea Poor Rate returns of 1790 and describe small areas of building and farming plots. Most of the land was undeveloped and open grass and marshland still dominated the area. In the early 19th century, development continued on land owned by Thomas Croxton, and the community became known as Croxton Town. The first houses were built by 1809 for skilled workers in what were called the &quot;mineral&quot; streets (such as Silver Street and Nickel Street). Around 1810, streets such as Hampshire Terrace, Landport Terrace, King&#x27;s Terrace, Wish Street (which later became King&#x27;s Road and Elm Grove), Jubilee Terrace and Bellevue Terrace were built adjacent to the old walls of the city. Although the streets still exist, many of them were among the most heavily bombed areas of Portsmouth in the Second World War, and like much of Southsea they experienced significant redevelopment in Postwar Britain.

The development of Southsea continued during the Napoleonic era and as the dockyard continued to grow, new homes were required for the increasing personnel, and many houses, villas and apartments were built. The architect and builder Thomas Ellis Owen created many of these, and the surviving buildings retain a coherent late Georgian and early Victorian style, and form a conservation area today, with many of the buildings having listed status. Owen built properties in Kent Road, Queen&#x27;s Terrace, Sussex Terrace, Elm Grove, Beach Road, Grove Road South, Clarendon Road, Osborne Road and Portland Terrace. The area between Castle Road and Victoria Road South was built up between 1835 and 1860. In 1851 St Jude&#x27;s CofE church was built on Kent Road to a design by Thomas Ellis Owen.

During the same period, Southsea grew as a leisure and bathing destination. In 1816 a pump room and baths were erected near the present day Clarence Pier, and by 1820 a large complex was developed including vapour baths, showers, and card playing and assembly rooms. The remaining marshland, known locally as &quot;The Great Morass&quot; was drained, leading to the creation of &quot;Southsea Common&quot;, some 480 acres (about 2 km2) of open grassland. Due to military requirements for clear lines of fire adjacent to Southsea Castle, the area was developed and remains today as a park and garden. Apartments and hotels were constructed towards the common and waterfront, along Southsea Terrace, Western Parade and Clarence Parade. The first large hotel was the Portland Hotel (destroyed in the Second World War) near Kent Road. Others soon followed, including the purpose-built Queens Hotel (1861), Pier Hotel (1865) and Beach Mansions Hotel (1866). In 1852 the Clarence Esplanade and a memorial were erected by public subscription, and development of the resort led in 1861 to Clarence Pier being constructed as a promenade pier and landing place for steamers. Other piers were also built, including the Victoria and Albert Piers, with the construction of South Parade Pier in 1879 marking the culmination of seafront development in the Victorian period. 
By the 1860s the suburb of Southsea had grown along Clarendon Road as far as Granada Road. In 1857 Southsea gained its own Improvement Commissioners responsible for paving, street cleaning and public lighting. The Southsea Railway came in 1885 and brought further development to the area, although it was to be financially unsuccessful and eventually closed in 1914. By the mid to late Victorian era, Southsea had become recognised as a largely middle-class neighbourhood, with many naval officers and other professionals taking up residence. During this time the writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lived in Portsmouth, moving to Southsea in June 1882 with less than £10 (£ today) to his name. He set up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, Southsea. Areas of Southsea suffered from the rapid development of the suburb; certain streets suffered from poverty and there was a major cholera outbreak in 1848. The works of the commission helped bring about some improvements and eventually led to the setting up of the Southsea Improvement Association.

===20th century===
Southsea continued to grow eastwards in the early 20th century, extending to the area of Eastney. During this time significant local public buildings were constructed including the Queens Hotel, in the Edwardian Baroque style built in 1903 and the Kings Theatre built in 1907. The onset of World War I saw an increase in fortifications on the seafront. Parades were held on Southsea Common. Southsea continued to thrive as a resort destination and a suburb of Portsmouth in the inter-war years, with many visitors in summer. At that time parts of the Common were converted into ornamental gardens and the Ladies&#x27; Mile was set out in 1925. However World War II had an immense impact on the urban and social fabric of the area. Huge areas of Southsea were destroyed by bombing during The Blitz. Although some of Victorian Southsea escaped the bombing, areas such as the Kings Road and Elm Grove were extensively damaged and the Palmerston Road shopping areas were completely destroyed. The beachfront, piers and promenades were closed for the duration of the war. Following the end of the war, in 1945 Southsea and the rest of Portsmouth embarked on a massive clearance and rebuilding scheme. Many areas of destroyed, damaged and intact low-income housing were cleared to make way for new building schemes. The Kings Road Estate and Roslyn House, among others, were developed between 1945 and the 1970s. Palmerston Road shopping area was developed in the 1950s and still stands today. Although visitor numbers to the resort area never recovered, Southsea continued to develop throughout the 20th century and today remains a mixed residential area and leisure destination.

===Recent history===
On 15 September 2000, parts of Southsea were flooded when a month&#x27;s worth of rain fell in 12 hours. The Eastney pumping station then failed due to the flood water. On 9 August 2011 a fire broke out at the former Joanna&#x27;s Nightclub, then derelict and later demolished, opposite South Parade Pier. A contemporary local newspaper report states that the incident was not linked to then-ongoing riots.

==Southsea Common==
Southsea Common is a large expanse of mown grassland parallel to the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle. The Common owes its existence to the demands of the military in the early nineteenth century for a clear range of fire from the harbour defences at any enemy ships which dared to approach Portsmouth and its dockyard. In 1874, the Portsmouth Corporation closed part of the common for private development which lead to four days of rioting. These riots became known as the &quot;Battle of Southsea&quot;. The police and army eventually dispersed the crowd but the development plans were abandoned.

The common is a popular recreation ground, and also serves as the venue for a number of annual events, including the Southsea Show, Para Spectacular, Military Vehicle Show, Kite Festival, Victorious Festival and a variety of circuses including the Moscow State Circus and Chinese State Circus. It was also the place where fans of Portsmouth F.C. gathered to celebrate their victory in the 2008 FA Cup Final. It also hosts the annual Portsmouth Pride celebrations, where in 2024 an estimated 20,000 people were in attendance. The Portsmouth Pride dates for 2025 is on 7 June 2025, starting at The Briny restaurant. 

On 6 June 1994 a drumhead service was held on Southsea Common in front of the Portsmouth Naval Memorial to commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-Day. The service was attended by all the heads of the states which had participated in the allied landings, notably HM Queen Elizabeth II and US President Bill Clinton. The service was also witnessed by over 100,000 members of the public. Historically, a blessing before battle was offered during a drumhead service which is conducted in the field with the drums forming the altar and the colours serving as the altar cloth.

On 28 June 2005 the Common was a venue for the Trafalgar 200 celebrations, the seafront an ideal point from which to witness the International Fleet Review and evening firework display.

In August 2010, &quot;Ultrasauros&quot;, a life-size (52 ft high) model of an ultrasauros dinosaur was erected on the common in conjunction with the Portsmouth&#x27;s Aspex Gallery. The sculpture was destroyed by a fire, thought to have been caused by an electrical fault, on 1 October.

In 2013 Victorious Festival moved from the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard to Southsea Common. The annual festival was extended to a 3-day event in 2017.

In September 2013, it was announced that a new Parkrun would begin along Southsea seafront in October 2013. As of February 2025 the Southsea Parkrun has hosted 525 events with an average finish time of 28 minutes and 50 seconds.

In July 2015 and 2016 Southsea Common hosted the America&#x27;s Cup World Series sailing event. The British sailing team Land Rover BAR is based in nearby Old Portsmouth.

===Trees===

The common is home to a collection of mature elm trees, believed to be the oldest and largest surviving in Hampshire, which have escaped Dutch elm disease owing to their isolation. The majority of the larger trees are Huntingdon Elms planted in the 1920s, but nearer the entrance to the Skate Park there is a fine example of a hybrid of the Siberian Elm &quot;Ulmus pumila&quot;. Huntingdon Elms once lined the Ladies&#x27; Mile—an avenue through the centre of the Common—but many were lost in the Great Storm of 1987 and replaced by the Dutch hybrid elm cultivar &#x27;Lobel&#x27;.

The Ladies&#x27; Mile is also home to several semi-mature Canary Island date palms &quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;. Planted in 1996, these palms are now some of the largest in the UK and for the last few years have fruited and produced viable seed, the first time this species of palm has been recorded doing so in the UK. Other palms growing close to the Common include &quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot;, (Ladies&#x27; Mile, Rock Gardens and Rose Garden), &quot;Chamaerops humilis&quot; (in front of the Pyramids Centre), &quot;Butia capitata&quot; (in Burgoyne Gardens) and &quot;Brahea armata&quot;, (Canoe Lake and D-Day Island). Many &quot;Cordyline australis&quot; are also planted in the area, though these are not true palms, but more closely related to yuccas and agaves.

==Tourist attractions==

===Seafront===
* Southsea beach is mostly flint gravel, but with sand exposed at low tide. There are two piers: South Parade Pier and Clarence Pier; both house amusement arcades. South Parade Pier also contains a ballroom and a bar area. Clarence Pier is adjacent to a permanent amusement park.
* There are a number of miniature golf courses, Southsea Skatepark, and public grass and clay tennis courts. During winter 2008 three beach volleyball courts were added to these attractions.
* The Blue Reef Aquarium is situated on the seafront.
* Just off the seafront is Southsea Model Village which is a 1/12 scale model village with forty miniature buildings, houses, forts, castles and a miniature railway. It was opened in 1956 in part of Lumps Fort. The other part of the Fort has been converted into Southsea Rose Garden.

===Historical features===
*A prominent sight out to sea are the four large round forts created in the 1860s as part of an attempt to fortify the city against the threat of invasion. They formed part of defences which included land-based forts around the city. The forts were never used in action and became known as Palmerston&#x27;s Folly, after the Prime Minister who initiated them.
*To commemorate the millennium, the Millennium Promenade was created extending to Gunwharf Quays from Southsea seafront. The walkway is marked on the pavement, and is lined by distinctive blue street lanterns.
*English Heritage blue plaques commemorating notable figures in Southsea include Lieutenant Norman Holbrooke VC, Fred T Jane, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Ellis Owen, Peter Sellers, Commander Edwin Unwin VC, and Dame Frances A Yates.

===Canoe Lake===
Canoe Lake is the last remnant of an area of marsh and open water known as the Great Morass, drained in 1886, on which much of Southsea now sits. The lake is topped up from the sea by a sluice gate at high tide. Some marine wildlife can be spotted in the lake, including fish, crabs, moon jellyfish, and reportedly even small sharks.

Mute swans and mallard can be seen regularly, with less frequent visits from tufted duck, Mediterranean gull, cormorant, little grebe and occasionally a lone feral black swan. Pedalos can be rented on the lake in the summer.

Since 2006 Canoe Lake has been a venue for the Lake of Lights Memorial Service, held each December, when thousands of lights are floated on the lake to commemorate loved ones in the local community who have been lost to cancer.

===Performing arts===
*The Kings Theatre on Albert Road hosts a variety of performances, including productions by the local amateur group the Southsea Shakespeare Actors.
* There are regular open-air concerts and events at the bandstand and on Castle Field, including Victorious Festival held on Southsea Common during the August bank holiday.
* &quot;Love Albert Road Day&quot; was an annual event in Southsea. The event featured live music, street art and theatre, stalls, food from around the world, an outdoor cinema, competitions and skate demos. Businesses along Albert Road remained open for the day. The first event was held in 2007 when it was expected 2000 visitors would attend and 20,000 turned up on the day. The second &quot;Love Albert Road Day&quot; was held on 28 September 2008 when 40,000 visitors attended.

===Museums===
* The D-Day Story (which holds the Overlord Embroidery) is located on the seafront in Southsea close to Southsea castle.
*Cumberland House natural history museum contains a butterfly house. 
* Toward the eastern end of the seafront is the Royal Marines Museum. Based in the lavishly decorated former Officers&#x27; Mess of Eastney Barracks (built in the 1860s for the Royal Marine Artillery), the museum includes &quot;The Making of the Royal Marines Commando&quot; exhibition, opened in 2008, and a refurbished Medal Room with over 8,000 medals earned by Royal Marines.

=== Albert Road ===
Albert Road is a well known road of the hosts a range of independent bars, restaurants, cafes and live music venues. It also hosts a range of cultural events. It is also houses the Kings Theatre and The Wedgewood Rooms.

=== Map mural ===

A large map of the area was painted on the side of a house at the junction of
Waverley Road and Clarendon Road, in 1997-1998. Due to water damage it was removed, the wall rendered and a new version painted in 2010. The artist, Mark Lewis, acquired a 99 year lease on the wall to ensure the mural&#x27;s longevity. In 2021 the celebrated map mural received a £5,000 grant to maintain and update it.

==Climate==
Southsea features a mild oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) that borderlines the warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), with warm summers and relatively mild, damp winters. Due to its southerly location and sheltering of northerly winds from Portsdown Hill, Southsea enjoys one of the mildest winters in the United Kingdom, and experiences higher temperatures than areas surrounding it, as well as higher sunshine hours. Summers tend to be warm with fewer extreme high temperatures than other areas in the South East of England.

== Southsea Town Council ==
On 1 April 1999 following a successful submission to the UK Government under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997 Southsea became a civil parish. The Parish Council later became the Southsea Town Council.

The initial creation of the town council was opposed by Portsmouth City Council. There was a long-standing campaign to disband the town council. In a poll of local residents in February 2010, 66.3 per cent voted to abolish it. The parish was abolished on 23 April 2010. It is now in the unparished area of Portsmouth.

The town council had limited powers and a small budget funded by the local precept. It campaigned on local issues, seeking to influence the unitary authority Portsmouth City Council, awarded funds to local causes and funded infrastructure improvements in the local area. Until 2007 it had a small office open to the public in Southsea town centre.

== Transport links ==

Hovertravel operates a regular hovercraft service to Ryde on the Isle of Wight from Southsea seafront. 
In 1898 a railway branch called the Southsea Railway was opened from platform 3 at Fratton Station, terminating at East Southsea Station (near to The Strand). Two unstaffed halts were added at Albert Road and Jessie Road/Devonshire Avenue. The line was not able to compete with the Portsmouth corporation tram services. It was closed in 1914 and never re-opened. The line itself and the station have since been demolished and replaced with houses. Southsea is now served by stations at Fratton and Portsmouth and Southsea station and on to Portsmouth Harbour (also called The Hard), with regular trains to London Waterloo and London Victoria.

There is a Hayling Island Ferry service linking Eastney and Ferry Point, on Hayling Island.

<doc id="61498" wikidata="Q1174069" url="?curid=61498" title="David Copperfield (1935 film)">
<text>David Copperfield is a 1935 American film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer based upon Charles Dickens&#x27; 1850 novel &quot;The Personal History, Adventures, Experience, &amp; Observation of David Copperfield the Younger&quot; (though a number of characters and incidents from the novel were omitted).

The story was adapted by Hugh Walpole from the Dickens novel, and the film was directed by George Cukor from a screenplay by Howard Estabrook and Lenore J. Coffee, who was not credited.

The novel was adapted for three silent film versions prior to this, the first sound production.

==Plot==
David&#x27;s father dies before his birth and therefore the young man is forced to spend his childhood without the presence of a father figure. He finds valid support in his mother and housekeeper Peggotty. David&#x27;s mother, however, feels the need to have a husband and therefore marries Mr. Murdstone, a severe and insensitive man, and welcomes his sister into the house; she proves to be even more insensitive than her brother.

When David&#x27;s mother dies, Murdstone sends David to London to work in his family&#x27;s wine bottling plant. During this time he is assisted by the Micawber family and forms a close friendship with its members. Mr. Micawber, with his courtly language and with his head a little in the air, is unable to look after the expenses of the house and gets into debt; at this point David decides to run away from London. After many adventures, he reaches Dover on foot, where his great-aunt, Betsie Trotwood, lives. His aunt welcomes him together with her roommate Mr. Dick and they send him to boarding school in Canterbury, where he rents a room with the lawyer Wickfield and forms a sincere friendship with Wickfield&#x27;s daughter, Agnes.

David meets Dora Spenlow at the ballet and falls in love, eventually marrying her. Dora is young and flighty and inept at running a household, and dies not long after their marriage. David and Micawber then help to unmask Uriah Heep as the forger and cheat that he is and return Wickfield&#x27;s firm to its rightful owner. David and Agnes end the film finally expressing their love for each other.

==Production==

David O. Selznick dearly wanted to film &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, as his Russian father, Lewis J. Selznick, had learned English through it, and read it to his sons every night. After failing to dissuade Selznick from the project, Louis B. Mayer, his father-in-law and employer, agreed that MGM would underwrite the production provided his star child contract actor Jackie Cooper was cast in the role of the young David. Selznick fought to remain true to the novel&#x27;s origins and prevailed, and the role went to Freddie Bartholomew after an extensive talent search in Canada and Great Britain by Selznick and George Cukor.

Cedric Gibbons designed a recreation of 19th century London on the MGM backlot. The scenes set outside Aunt Betsey&#x27;s house atop the white cliffs of Dover were filmed at Malibu. MGM even filmed the exterior of Canterbury Cathedral, which only appears in the film for less than a minute. Special effects, including many matte shots, were by Slavko Vorkapić.

Charles Laughton was originally cast in the role of Mr. Micawber, and was authentically made up with a bald cap, since Dickens describes the character as hairless. After two days&#x27; work, he disliked his performance in the dailies and asked to be replaced. It was said at the time that &quot;he looked as though he were about to molest the child.&quot;

Selznick released Laughton, who, in turn, recommended comedian and Dickens scholar W. C. Fields for the part. A clause in Fields&#x27; contract stated that he had to play the part with a British accent, but as he had difficulty learning the lines and had to read off cue cards he thus speaks in his own accent in the role. His defense: &quot;My father was an Englishman and I inherited this accent from him! Are you trying to go &quot;against&quot; nature?!&quot; This is the only film where Fields does not ad lib, and he plays the character in a straightforward manner (although he did want to add a juggling sequence; when this was denied, an anecdote about snakes, which was also denied). Director George Cukor said that when Fields did make a suggestion for a visual bit, such as accidentally dipping his quill in a teacup instead of an inkwell, it was always within the parameters of the character. The result was one of the finest performances of that year.

==Reception==
The film was well-received upon its release in January 1935. Andre Sennwald of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the most profoundly satisfying screen manipulation of a great novel the camera has ever given us.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it had &quot;one of the most evenly good casts ever to have been assembled&quot;, with staging and costumes that were &quot;almost always excellent.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; found the first half of the film &quot;one of the superb things of the movies&quot; and the second half more conventional, though &quot;all of it is good.&quot; Mosher also praised the casting and opined that Freddie Bartholemew put on &quot;one of the prettiest performances ever given on the screen by a youngster.&quot; &quot;David Copperfield&quot; topped the &quot;Film Daily&quot; year-end poll of 451 critics around the country as the best film of 1935.

&quot;David Copperfield&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Film Editing (Robert J. Kern), and Best Assistant Director (Joseph M. Newman), and was nominated for the Mussolini Cup for Best Foreign Film at the Venice Film Festival (losing out to &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;).

It was the 20th most popular film at the British box office in 1935-1936 after &quot;Modern Times&quot;, &quot;Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot;, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, &quot;Top Hat&quot;, &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, &quot;Mr Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;The Iron Duke&quot;, &quot;Love Me Forever&quot;, &quot;Sanders of the River&quot;, &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, &quot;The Ghost Goes West&quot;, &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot;, &quot;Swing Time&quot;, &quot;Things to Come&quot;, &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, &quot;Clive of India&quot;, and &quot;Escape Me Never&quot;.

There were several notable differences in the film from the book. For instance, in the film David never attends Salem House boarding school, and so the characters he met there do not appear, with the exception of Steerforth, who is instead introduced as head boy of the school David attends after going to live with Betsey Trotwood.

It is shown in many countries on television at Christmas. It is rated with four out of four stars every year in &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot;.

This was selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the 1000 greatest movies ever made.

The film is referred to in the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;The Deadly Attachment&quot;.

===Box office===
According to MGM records the film earned $2,969,000 at the box office worldwide and made a profit of $686,000. It earned an additional $95,000 from a reissue in 1937-1938.

<text>Ruggles of Red Gap is a 1935 American comedy film directed by Leo McCarey and starring: Charles Laughton, Mary Boland, Charlie Ruggles and ZaSu Pitts and featuring Roland Young and Leila Hyams. It was based on the best-selling 1915 novel by Harry Leon Wilson, adapted by Humphrey Pearson, with a screenplay by Walter DeLeon and Harlan Thompson.

The story concerns a British gentleman&#x27;s gentleman who discovers a “new birth of freedom” in a small Western American town in the early 20th century.

&quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; was “an immense commercial hit” and confirmed Leo McCarey&#x27;s stature as Paramount&#x27;s outstanding comedy filmmaker of his day.

==Plot==
Marmaduke Ruggles is valet to the Earl of Burnstead in 1908. Earl tells Ruggles that he has gambled him away in a drunken game of poker, and he is to report to his new masters – &quot;nouveau riche&quot; American millionaires Egbert and Effie Floud – immediately. Ruggles bemoans the idea of being relegated to &quot;the land of slavery,&quot; but he takes his new occupation in stride.

Egbert slips away from Effie and takes Ruggles to a Parisian café. He explains to the valet that, in America, everyone is equal, and Ruggles should behave like a friend rather than a deferential servant. Ruggles is dismissive, but after a night of drinking with Egbert and his wild friend Jeff Tuttle, his &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; falls away as he follows the examples of Egbert and Tuttle. The three embark on an alcohol-fueled trip across Paris which ends with them returning to the Floud&#x27;s hotel room. The next day Ruggles is embarrassed, and he apologizes to Effie for his behavior.

The Flouds return to the town of Red Gap in America. Ruggles meets the extended family of the Flouds, including &quot;Ma&quot; Pettingill, Effie&#x27;s mother, and Charles Belknap-Jackson, a snooty relative of Effie&#x27;s who treats Ruggles with disdain. A party held to receive the Flouds inadvertently turns into a warm welcome for Ruggles after Ruggles is mistaken for a wealthy retired Englishman. Ruggles also meets Mrs. Judson, a widowed housewife and cook. When Belknap-Jackson chastises Ruggles for dancing at the party with Mrs. Judson, Ruggles kicks him in the behind. He is almost fired, but his job is saved as a newspaper article describing Ruggles as an &quot;honored houseguest&quot; of the Flouds makes him a local celebrity.

Ruggles becomes a fixture in society, as Effie and Belknap-Jackson use his status to advance socially. He begins a relationship with Mrs. Judson and reads about the history of the United States. One day, after the rest of the family have left on a trip, Belknap-Jackson fires Ruggles. While waiting for the train, Ruggles wanders into the local saloon where he finds Mrs. Judson, Egbert, and Ma. Egbert laughs off Belknap-Jackson&#x27;s actions, but Ruggles explains that he wants to live as a free and independent person and, because of that, he won&#x27;t return to work for the Flouds. Egbert compares this to &quot;what Lincoln said at Gettysburg&quot;, but neither he, nor any of the other people in the saloon can remember the words. As they each try to remind themselves of what it says, Ruggles stands up and recites the entire Gettysburg Address from memory.

Ruggles decides to open a restaurant in Red Gap. As he is preparing the restaurant space with Mrs. Judson, Effie arrives with troubling news: the Earl of Burnstead is visiting Red Gap to buy Ruggles back from the Flouds. Ruggles reluctantly agrees to return to the Flouds, but Mrs. Judson is disgusted by his deference to his former employers. On the night of a party in the Earl&#x27;s honor, Ruggles goes missing. Egbert convinces the Earl to slip out to another, more raucous party hosted by the beautiful young Nell Kenner, to whom the Earl instantly takes an interest. They eventually return to the Floud house, just as Ruggles returns and informs the Earl of his decision to &quot;be someone&quot; and live independently, on his own terms.

The restaurant opening proves to be a great success. All the friends he has made on his journey from England to America attend its gala opening. Belknap-Jackson also attends and insults Ruggles and his cooking to his face, so Ruggles throws him out. Ruggles retreats to the kitchen, sure that he has ruined his social standing in Red Gap. Outside, the diners begin to sing &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow,&quot; but Ruggles doesn&#x27;t realize they are singing for him. Egbert pulls him out of the kitchen, saying: &quot;Why, you old plate of soup, they&#x27;re singing it for you!&quot; As the song crescendos, Egbert pushes Ruggles back into the kitchen so that he can celebrate privately with Mrs. Judson.

==Production==

Based on the best-selling 1915 novel by Harry Leon Wilson, Ruggles of Red Gap was adapted to screen by Humphery Pearson, with a screenplay by Walter DeLeon and Harlan Thompson. The story had twice been adapted to film in the silent era: in 1918 and again in 1923.

Regarded as the most outstanding comedy director with Paramount at the time, studio executives provided Leo McCarey with top quality talent for the picture. Indeed, the &quot;A&quot; film or high production period of McCarey&#x27;s career can be dated from &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap.&quot;”

According to film historian Wes D. Gehring, McCarey cast Charles Laughton in the lead role when he detected a “comedic flourish” in the actor&#x27;s Academy Award-winning performance as the English king, in &#x27;The Private Life of Henry VIII&#x27; (1933).

The film was shot on locations in Humboldt County, California.

==Reception==

Both director Leo McCarey and actor Charles Laughton received overwhelming critical accolades for their work in &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;. Film historian Wes D. Gehring reports that “The press was so good on &quot;Ruggles&quot; that references to the picture began to turn up in reviews of other pictures.”

The &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; titled their effusive review of the picture “McCarey, Laughton and Ruggles Tops.” Richard Watts, Jr. at the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; described Laughton&#x27;s Ruggles as “the most sympathetic hero since Rip Van Winkle, and Laughton&#x27;s acting was favorably compared to that of Charlie Chaplin.

The &quot;New York Tribune&quot;’s Howard Barnes wrote: “Leo McCarey, who may be remembered gratefully for &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;, has produced and directed the film with courage, power and imagination.”
So consistently positive were the reviews that Paramount simply issued a statement directing the public to refer to press reports concerning the movie, without further comment.

==Retrospective appraisal==

Describing the film as “an odd little masterpiece,” &quot;Moma&quot; film curator Charles Silver places Ruggles of Red Gap within the realm of screwball produced during the 1930s and praises “McCarey&#x27;s genius for directing actors and his exquisite sense of timing.” Silver adds that “the film&#x27;s dramatic high point is Laughton&#x27;s barroom recitation of the Gettysburg Address and its assertion of “a new birth of freedom.”

Leland Poague declares that “&quot;Ruggles&quot; is arguably McCarey&#x27;s most &quot;personal&quot;, most &quot;social&quot;, and most &quot;idealistic&quot; film” in his &quot;oeuvre&quot;.

==Theme==
McCarey locates the film&#x27;s central thematic element in the natural discord between “personal and social imperatives” and the struggle to bring these into balance. Ruggles of Red Gap demonstrates the reciprocity required to allow the flourishing of each in a democratic republic. “In Ruggles, McCarey explores the relationship between personality and society and does so in an idealistic literary context which asserts the essential (and necessary) identity of personal and social imperatives.”

===Gettysburg address scene===

Film historian Wes D. Gehring describes &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; as “the story of a proper British butler, lost in a poker game to a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; American, evolves into a free man.”

The origins of the film sequence arose from an event in McCarey&#x27;s own life. During a alcohol-fueled social gathering, the topic of the Gettysburg Address came up; everyone agreed as to its importance, but no one present could recite a word of the iconic document.

The film fully takes shape as a “populist classic” with the sequence in which Laughton, the former body servant to a wealthy English gentleman, recites the Gettysburg Address, a speech delivered by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, announcing a “new birth of freedom” for the people of the American republic.

Ruggles, an immigrant to the United States, delivers the speech in the Silver Dollar saloon occupied entirely by “All-American Western types.” The moving content of the address comes as a revelation and a liberation to most of the denizens of Red Gap.

==Awards and nominations==
Charles Laughton won the New York Film Critics&#x27; Circle Awards for &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; (with &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;) in 1935. The National Board of Review named the film the ninth best of 1935. That year, Laughton&#x27;s other two films, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, were sixth and eighth on the list, respectively. The film was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture and competed against two other Laughton films that were also nominated: &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (which won the award) and &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

In 2014, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Other adaptations==
Harry Leon Wilson&#x27;s novel &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; was adapted for the Broadway stage as a musical in 1915, the same year that it was published. It was first made into a silent film in 1918 and again in 1923 (the latter with Edward Everett Horton as Ruggles).

A musical adaptation called &quot;Fancy Pants&quot; starring Bob Hope and Lucille Ball was released in 1950.

&quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; was adapted as a radio play several times. First on the July 10, 1939 episode of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;; second on the December 17, 1945 episode of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;; and third on the June 8, 1946 episode of &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot;. All of these adaptations found Charles Laughton and Charlie Ruggles reprising their film parts.

A television musical version was produced on &quot;Producer&#x27;s Showcase&quot; in 1957, starring Michael Redgrave, Peter Lawford, David Wayne and Jane Powell. The songs were created by Jule Styne and Leo Robin.

<text>Top Hat is a 1935 American musical screwball comedy film, in which Fred Astaire plays an American tap dancer named Jerry Travers, who arrives in London to star in a show produced by Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton). He meets and attempts to impress Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) to win her affection. The film also features Eric Blore as Hardwick&#x27;s valet Bates, Erik Rhodes as Alberto Beddini, a fashion designer and rival for Dale&#x27;s affections, and Helen Broderick as Hardwick&#x27;s long-suffering wife Madge.

The film was directed by Mark Sandrich, and was written by Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor, with songs by Irving Berlin. &quot;Top Hat, White Tie and Tails&quot; and &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; have become American song classics. It has been nostalgically referred to—particularly its &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; segment—in many films, including &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Boss Baby&quot; (2017).

Astaire and Rogers made nine films together at RKO Pictures, including: &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; (1934), &quot;Roberta&quot; (1935), &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936), &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937), and &quot;Carefree&quot; (1938). &quot;Top Hat&quot; was the most successful picture of Astaire and Rogers&#x27; partnership (and Astaire&#x27;s second most successful picture after &quot;Easter Parade&quot;), achieving second place in worldwide box-office receipts for 1935. While some dance critics maintain that &quot;Swing Time&quot; contained a finer set of dances, &quot;Top Hat&quot; remains, to this day, the partnership&#x27;s best-known work.

&quot;Top Hat&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in its second year, 1990, as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film has also been recognized by the American Film Institute on various lists commemorating the best of American cinema; the film appeared on their list of the twenty five greatest film musicals at number 15, and &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; appeared on their list of the one hundred greatest songs of American cinema, also at number 15.

==Plot==
American dancer Jerry Travers comes to London to star in a show produced by the bumbling Horace Hardwick. While practicing a tap dance routine in his hotel bedroom, he awakens Dale Tremont on the floor below. She storms upstairs to complain, whereupon Jerry falls hopelessly in love with her and proceeds to pursue her all over London.

Dale mistakes Jerry for Horace, who is married to her friend Madge. Following the success of Jerry&#x27;s opening night in London, Jerry follows Dale to Venice, where she is visiting Madge and modelling/promoting the gowns created by Alberto Beddini, a dandified Italian fashion designer with a penchant for malapropisms.

Jerry proposes to Dale, who, while still believing that Jerry is Horace, is disgusted that her friend&#x27;s husband could behave in such a manner and agrees instead to marry Alberto. Fortunately, Bates, Horace&#x27;s meddling English valet, disguises himself as a priest and conducts the ceremony; Horace had sent Bates to keep tabs on Dale.

On a trip in a gondola, Jerry manages to convince Dale and they return to the hotel where the previous confusion is rapidly cleared up. The reconciled couple dance off into the Venetian sunset, to the tune of &quot;The Piccolino.&quot;

==Production==

&quot;Top Hat&quot; began filming on April 1, 1935, and cost $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June and the first public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of approximately ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed to show off the huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke all records, went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO&#x27;s most profitable film of the 1930s. After &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, it made more money than any other film released in 1935.

===Script development===
Dwight Taylor was the principal screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that &quot;it is patterned too closely after &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot;&quot;, and &quot;I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour&quot;. Allan Scott, for whom this movie served as his first major project, and who would go on to serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout. Allegedly Ben Holmes, Ralph Spence, and Károly Nóti were further contributors to the script. The story itself was later said to have been inspired by two sources: &quot;Scandal in Budapest&quot; by Sándor Faragó, and &quot;A Girl Who Dares&quot; by Aladar LaszloIt.

The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini&#x27;s motto: &quot;For the women the kiss, for the men the sword&quot; which originally ran: &quot;For the men the sword, for the women the whip.&quot; Of his role in the creation of &quot;Top Hat&quot;, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared &quot;a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture can be summed up in the word &quot;inconsequentiality&quot;. When I left RKO a year later, Mark said to me, &#x27;You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen.&#x27;&quot; On the film&#x27;s release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot;.

===Musical score and orchestration===
This was composer Irving Berlin&#x27;s first complete film score since 1930 and he negotiated a unique contract, retaining the copyrights to the score with a guarantee of ten percent of the profits if the film earned in excess of $1,250,000. Eight songs from the original score were discarded as they were not considered to advance the film&#x27;s plot. One of these, &quot;Get Thee Behind Me, Satan&quot;, was also used in &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936). All five songs eventually selected became major hits and, in the September 28, 1935 broadcast of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, all five featured in the top fifteen songs selected for that week.

Astaire recalled how this success helped restore Berlin&#x27;s flagging self-confidence. Astaire had never met Berlin before this film, although he had danced on stage to some of his tunes as early as 1915. There ensued a lifelong friendship with Berlin contributing to more Astaire films (six in total) than any other composer. Of his experience with Astaire in &quot;Top Hat&quot; Berlin wrote: &quot;He&#x27;s a real inspiration for a writer. I&#x27;d never have written &quot;Top Hat&quot; without him. He makes you feel so secure.&quot;

As Berlin could not read or write music and could only pick out tunes on a specially designed piano that transposed keys automatically, he required an assistant to make up his piano parts. Hal Borne—Astaire&#x27;s rehearsal pianist—performed this role in &quot;Top Hat&quot; and recalled working nights with him in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel: &quot;Berlin went &#x27;Heaven...&#x27; and I went &quot;dah dah dee&quot; &#x27;I&#x27;m in Heaven&#x27; &quot;(dah-dah-dee)&quot;. He said, &#x27;I love it, put it down.&#x27;&quot; These parts were subsequently orchestrated by a team comprising Edward Powell, Maurice de Packh, Gene Rose, Eddie Sharp, and Arthur Knowlton who worked under the overall supervision of Max Steiner.

Berlin broke a number of the conventions of American songwriting in this film, especially in the songs &quot;Top Hat, White Tie and Tails&quot; and &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, and according to Rogers, the film became the talk of Hollywood as a result of its score.

===Set design===
In an Astaire-Rogers picture, the Big White Set—as these Art Deco-inspired creations were known—took up the largest share of the film&#x27;s production costs, and &quot;Top Hat&quot; was no exception. A winding canal—spanned by two staircase bridges at one end and a flat bridge on the other—was built across two adjoining sound stages. Astaire and Rogers dance across this flat bridge in &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;. Around the bend from this bridge was located the main piazza, a giant stage coated in red bakelite that was the location for &quot;The Piccolino&quot;. This fantasy representation of the Lido of Venice was on three levels comprising dance floors, restaurants and terraces, all decorated in candy-cane colors, with the canal waters dyed black. The vast Venetian interiors were similarly inauthentic, reflecting instead the latest Hollywood tastes.

Carroll Clark, who worked under the general supervision of Van Nest Polglase, was the unit art director on all but one of the Astaire-Rogers films. He managed the team of designers responsible for the scenery and furnishings of &quot;Top Hat&quot;.

===Wardrobe: The &quot;feathers&quot; incident===
Although Bernard Newman was nominally in charge of dressing the stars, Rogers was keenly interested in dress design and make-up. For the &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; routine, she was determined to use her own creation: &quot;I was determined to wear this dress, come hell or high water. And why not? It moved beautifully. Obviously, no one in the cast or crew was willing to take sides, particularly not my side. This was all right with me. I&#x27;d had to stand alone before. At least my mother was there to support me in the confrontation with the entire front office, plus Fred Astaire and Mark Sandrich.&quot;

Due to the enormous labor involved in sewing each ostrich feather to the dress, Astaire—who normally approved his partner&#x27;s gowns and suggested modifications if necessary during rehearsals—saw the dress for the first time on the day of the shoot, and was horrified at the way it shed clouds of feathers at every twist and turn, recalling later: &quot;It was like a chicken attacked by a coyote, I never saw so many feathers in my life.&quot; According to choreographer Hermes Pan, Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers, who promptly burst into tears, whereupon her mother, Lela, &quot;came charging at him like a mother rhinoceros protecting her young.&quot;
An additional night&#x27;s work by seamstresses resolved much of the problem; however, careful examination of the dance on film reveals feathers floating around Astaire and Rogers and lying on the dance floor. Later, Astaire and Pan presented Rogers with a gold feather for her charm bracelet, and serenaded her with a ditty parodying Berlin&#x27;s tune:

Thereafter, Astaire nicknamed Rogers &quot;Feathers&quot;—also a title of one of the chapters in his autobiography—and parodied his experience in a song and dance routine with Judy Garland in &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948).

Astaire also chose and provided his own clothes. He is widely credited with influencing 20th century male fashion and, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; male fashion editor, G. Bruce Boyer, the &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Lovely Day?&quot; routine: &quot;shows Astaire dressed in the style he would make famous: soft-shouldered tweed sports jacket, button-down shirt, bold striped tie, easy-cut gray flannels, silk paisley pocket square, and suede shoes. It&#x27;s an extraordinarily contemporary approach to nonchalant elegance, a look Ralph Lauren and a dozen other designers still rely on more than six decades later. Astaire introduced a new style of dress that broke step with the spats, celluloid collars, and homburgs worn by aristocratic European-molded father-figure heroes.&quot;

==Musical numbers and choreography==
The choreography, in which Astaire was assisted by Hermes Pan, is principally concerned throughout with the possibilities of using taps to make as much noise as possible. In the film, Astaire suffers from what Rogers terms an &quot;affliction&quot;: &quot;Every once in a while I suddenly find myself dancing.&quot; Astaire introduces the film&#x27;s tap motif when he blasts a tap barrage at the somnolent members of a London Club. There are eight musical numbers.

In the &quot;Opening Sequence&quot;, after the RKO logo appears, Astaire, shown only from the waist down, dances onto a polished stage floor, backed by a male chorus sporting canes. On pausing his name appears. Rogers then follows suit and the two dance together as the picture dissolves to reveal a top hat. A similar concept was used in the opening sequence of &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (1949).

The second is &quot;No Strings (I&#x27;m Fancy Free)&quot;. On retiring to his hotel suite, Horton advises him to get married. Astaire declares his preference for bachelorhood and the song—this number was the brainchild of scriptwriter Dwight Taylor and is found in his earliest drafts—emerges naturally and in mid-sentence. Astaire sings it through twice and during the last phrase leaps into a ballet jump, accompanied by leg beats, and launches into a short solo dance that builds in intensity and volume progressing from tap shuffles &quot;sur place&quot;, via traveling patterns, to rapid-fire heel jabs finishing with a carefree tour of the suite during which he beats on the furniture with his hands. On his return to the center of the room, where he noisily concentrates his tap barrage, the camera cranes down to discover Rogers in bed, awake and irritated. As she makes her way upstairs, Horton fields telephone complaints from hotel management. Astaire incorporates this into his routine, first startling him with a tap burst then escorting him ostentatiously to the telephone. As Horton leaves to investigate, Astaire continues to hammer his way around the suite, during which he feigns horror at seeing his image in a mirror—a reference to his belief that the camera was never kind to his face. The routine ends as Astaire, now dancing with a statue, is interrupted by Rogers&#x27; entrance, a scene which, as in &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; and &quot;Roberta&quot;, typifies the way in which Astaire inadvertently incurs the hostility of Rogers, only to find her attractive and wear down her resistance.

In &quot;No Strings (reprise)&quot;, Rogers, after storming upstairs to complain, returns to her room at which point Astaire, still intent on dancing, nominates himself her &quot;sandman&quot;, sprinkling sand from a cigarette receptacle and lulling her, Horton and eventually himself to sleep with a soft and gentle sand dance, to a &quot;diminuendo&quot; reprise of the melody, in a scene which has drawn considerable admiration from dance commentators, and has been the subject of affectionate screen parodies.

In &quot;Isn&#x27;t This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain)&quot;, while Rogers is out riding, a thunderstorm breaks and she takes shelter in a bandstand. Astaire follows her and a conversation about clouds and rainfall soon gives way to Astaire&#x27;s rendering of this, one of Berlin&#x27;s most prized creations. Astaire sings to Rogers&#x27; back, but the audience can see that Rogers&#x27; attitude towards him softens during the song, and the purpose of the ensuing dance is for her to communicate this change to her partner. The dance is one of flirtation and, according to Mueller, deploys two choreographic devices common to the classical minuet: sequential imitation (one dancer performs a step and the other responds) and touching. Initially, the imitation is mocking in character, then becomes more of a casual exchange, and ends in a spirit of true cooperation. Until the last thirty seconds of this two and a half minute dance the pair appear to pull back from touching, then with a crook of her elbow Rogers invites Astaire in. The routine, at once comic and romantic, incorporates hopping steps, tap spins with barrages, loping and dragging steps among its many innovative devices. The spirit of equality which pervades the dance is reflected in the masculinity of Rogers&#x27; clothes and in the friendly handshake they exchange at the end.

For &quot;Top Hat, White Tie and Tails&quot;, probably Astaire&#x27;s most celebrated tap solo, the idea for the title song came from Astaire who described to Berlin a routine he had created for the 1930 Ziegfeld Broadway flop &quot;Smiles&quot; called &quot;Say, Young Man of Manhattan,&quot; in which he gunned down a chorus of men—which included a young Bob Hope and Larry Adler—with his cane. Berlin duly produced the song from his trunk and the concept of the film was then built around it. In this number Astaire had to compromise on his one-take philosophy, as Sandrich acknowledged: &quot;We went to huge lengths to make the &#x27;Top Hat&#x27; number look like one take, but actually it&#x27;s several.&quot; Astaire&#x27;s remarkable ability to change the tempo within a single dance phrase is extensively featured throughout this routine and taken to extremes—as when he explodes into activity from a pose of complete quiet and vice versa. This routine also marks Astaire&#x27;s first use of a cane as a prop in one of his filmed dances. The number opens with a chorus strutting and lunging in front of a backdrop of a Parisian street scene. They make way for Astaire who strides confidently to the front of the stage and delivers the song, which features the famous line: &quot;I&#x27;m stepping out, my dear, to breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class,&quot; trading the occasional tap barrage with the chorus as he sings. The dance begins with Astaire and chorus moving in step. Astaire soon lashes out with a swirling tap step and the chorus responds timidly before leaving the stage in a sequence of overlapping, direction-shifting, hitch steps and walks. In the first part of the solo which follows, Astaire embarks on a circular tap movement, embellished with cane taps into which he mixes a series of unpredictable pauses. As the camera retreats the lights dim and, in the &quot;misterioso&quot; passage which follows, Astaire mimes a series of stances, ranging from overt friendliness, wariness, surprise to watchful readiness and jaunty confidence. Jimmy Cagney attended the shooting of this scene and advised Astaire, who claims to have ad-libbed much of this section. The chorus then returns in a threatening posture, and Astaire proceeds to dispatch them all, using an inventive series of actions miming the cane&#x27;s use as a gun, a submachine gun, a rifle and, finally, a bow and arrow.

Astaire&#x27;s first seduction of Rogers in &quot;Isn&#x27;t This a Lovely Day,&quot; falls foul of the mistaken-identity theme of the plot, so he makes a second attempt, encouraged by Broderick, in the number &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;. As in &quot;No Strings,&quot; the song emerges from Astaire&#x27;s mid-sentence as he dances with the hesitant Rogers on a crowded floor. Berlin wrote the words and music to this enduring classic in one day, and, at 72 measures, it is the longest song he ever wrote. He was very appreciative of Astaire&#x27;s treatment of the song: &quot;The melody keeps going up and up. He crept up there. It didn&#x27;t make a damned bit of difference. He made it.&quot; As he navigates through this difficult material, Rogers looks attracted and receptive and, at the end of the song, they dance cheek to cheek across a bridge to a deserted ballroom area nearby. According to Mueller&#x27;s analysis, the duet that follows—easily the most famous of all the Astaire-Rogers partnered dances—reflects the complexity of the emotional situation in which the pair find themselves. No longer flirting, as in &quot;Isn&#x27;t This a Lovely Day?,&quot; the pair are now in love. But Rogers feels guilty and deceived and would prefer to avoid Astaire&#x27;s advances—in effect, fall out of love with him. Therefore, Astaire&#x27;s purpose here is to make her put aside her misgivings (which are a mystery to him) and surrender completely to him. The choreographic device introduced to reflect the progress of this seduction is the supported backbend, exploiting Rogers&#x27; exceptionally flexible back. The main dance begins with the first of two brief passages which reuse the device of sequential imitation introduced in &quot;Isn&#x27;t This a Lovely Day?&quot;. The pair spin and lean, dodging back and forth past each other before moving into a standard ballroom position where the first hints of the supported backbend are introduced. The first backbend occurs at the end of a sequence where Astaire sends Rogers into a spin, collects her upstage and maneuvers her into a linked-arm stroll forward, repeats the spin but this time encircles her while she turns and then takes her in his arms. As the music becomes more energetic, the dancers flow across the floor and Rogers, moving against the music, suddenly falls into a deeper backbend, which is then repeated, only deeper still. The music now transitions to a quiet recapitulation of the main melody during which the pair engage in a muted and tender partnering, and here the second passage involving sequential imitation appears. With the music reaching its grand climax Astaire and Rogers rush toward the camera, then away in a series of bold, dramatic manoeuvers culminating in three ballroom lifts which showcase Rogers&#x27; dress before abruptly coming to a halt in a final, deepest backbend, maintained as the music approaches its closing bars. They rise, and after a couple of turns dancing cheek to cheek for the first time since the dance began, come to rest next to a wall. Rogers, having conducted the dance in a state of dreamlike abandon now glances uneasily at Astaire before walking away, as if reminded that their relationship cannot proceed.

By now, Rogers has learned Astaire&#x27;s true identity although neither of them yet know that her impulsive marriage to Rhodes is null and void. Dining together during carnival night in Venice, and to help assuage her guilt, Astaire declares: &quot;Let&#x27;s eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we have to face him,&quot; which serves as the cue for the music of &quot;The Piccolino&quot;, the film&#x27;s big production number. A gondola parade is followed by the entry of a dancing chorus who perform a series of ballroom poses and rippling-pattern routines choreographed by Hermes Pan. Berlin, who lavished a great deal of effort on the song designed it as a pastiche of &quot;The Carioca&quot; from &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Continental&quot; from &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; (1934), and the lyric communicates its fake origin: &quot;It was written by a Latin/A gondolier who sat in/his home out in Brooklyn/and gazed at the stars.&quot; It is a song about a song and Rogers sings it to Astaire after which an off-camera chorus repeats it while the dance ensemble is photographed, Busby Berkeley-style, from above. The camera then switches to Rogers and Astaire who bound down to the stage to perform a two-minute dance—all shot in one take—with the Astaire-Pan choreography separately referencing the basic melody and the Latin vamp in the accompaniment. They dance to the accompaniment as they descend the steps and glide along the dance floor, then, when the melody enters, they halt and perform the Piccolino step, which involves the feet darting out to the side of the body. The rest of the dance involves repetitions and variations of the Piccolino step and the hopping steps associated with the vamp, leading to some complex amalgamations of the two. On the vamp melody&#x27;s final appearance, the dancers perform a highly embellished form of the Piccolino step as they travel sideways back to their table, sinking back into their chairs and lifting their glasses in a toast.

&quot;The Piccolino (reprise)&quot;: After the various parties confront each other in the bridal suite, with Rogers&#x27; &quot;marriage&quot; to Rhodes revealed as performed by a fake clergyman, the scene is set for Astaire and Rogers to dance into the sunset, which they duly do, in this fragment of a much longer duet—the original was cut after the July 1935 previews—but not before they parade across the Venetian set and reprise the Piccolino step.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York on August 29, 1935 and set a house record with a gross of $134,800 in its first week. Twenty-five policemen were deployed to control the crowds. In its 3 weeks at the Music Hall, it grossed $350,000. Overall, the film earned rentals of $1,782,000 in the US and Canada and $1,420,000 elsewhere. RKO made a profit of $1,325,000, making it the studio&#x27;s most profitable film of the 1930s.

It was the 4th most popular film at the British box office in 1935–36.

===Critical response===
Reviews for &quot;Top Hat&quot; were mainly positive. The &quot;Los Angeles Evening Herald Express&quot; praised the film, exclaiming &quot;&quot;Top Hat&quot; is the tops! With Fred Astaire dancing and singing Irving Berlin tunes! Well, one (in his right mind) couldn&#x27;t ask for much more—unless, of course, it could be a couple of encores.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s musical numbers, but criticized the storyline, describing it as &quot;a little on the thin side,&quot; but also stating that &quot;it is sprightly enough to plug those inevitable gaps between the shimmeringly gay dances.&quot;Top Hat&quot; is worth standing in line for. From the appearance of the lobby yesterday afternoon, you probably will have to.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; also singled out the storyline as well as the cast, stating &quot;the danger sign is in the story and cast. Substitute Alice Brady for Helen Broderick and it&#x27;s the same lineup of players as was in &quot;The Gay Divorcée&quot;. Besides which the situations in the two scripts parallel each other closely&quot;. Nevertheless, it concluded that &quot;Top Hat&quot; was a film &quot;one can&#x27;t miss&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1935, Graham Greene gave the film a generally positive review, describing the film as &quot;a vehicle for Fred Astaire&#x27;s genius&quot;, and noting that Astaire&#x27;s performance eliminated any concern over the fact that &quot;the music and lyrics are bad&quot; or that Astaire &quot;has to act with human beings [who cannot match] his freedom, lightness, and happiness&quot;.

, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film had a 100% &quot;fresh&quot; approval rating based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 8.70/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A glamorous and enthralling depression-era diversion, &quot;Top Hat&quot; is nearly flawless, with acrobatics by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers that make the hardest physical stunts seem light as air.&quot;

===Awards and honors===
The film was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture, as well as Art Direction (Carroll Clark and Van Nest Polglase), Original Song (Irving Berlin for &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;), and Dance Direction (Hermes Pan for &quot;Piccolino&quot; and &quot;Top Hat&quot;). In 1990, &quot;Top Hat&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film ranked number 15 on the 2006 American Film Institute&#x27;s list of best musicals.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Top Hat&quot; has been nostalgically referenced—particularly its &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; segment—in many films, including &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999), &quot;La La Land&quot; (2016) and the animated film &quot;The Boss Baby&quot; (2017).
Top Hat&#x27;s movie poster appeared in Stephen Chow&#x27;s movie Kung Fu Hustle. British-Irish singer-songwriter Chris de Burgh referenced the movie in his 1986 hit, &quot;The Lady in Red&quot;, wherein he and the eponymous lady in the song danced &quot;Cheek to Cheek.&quot;

The film is the namesake for the seventh episode of the DC Studios miniseries &quot;The Penguin&quot;, a spin-off of the 2022 film &quot;The Batman&quot;. In the episode, a young Oz Cobb and his mother Francis watch the film in a flashback. In the present, Francis is kidnapped by Oz&#x27;s rival Sofia Gigante, who she tells that she believes Oz will kill her, and when he does, &quot;[she&#x27;ll] be tap dancing on [her] grave like Ginger fuckin&#x27; Rogers&quot;.

==Stage adaptation==

The film has been adapted into a stage musical that began touring the UK during late 2011. The cast included Summer Strallen as Dale, Tom Chambers as Jerry and Martin Ball as Horace. The show opened at Milton Keynes Theatre on August 19, 2011, before touring to other UK regional theatres including Leeds, Birmingham and Edinburgh. The production transferred to the West End&#x27;s Aldwych Theatre on April 19, 2012, opening on May 9, 2012. It won three Olivier Awards in 2013, including for Best New Musical.

==Home media==
In 2003, a digitally restored version of &quot;Top Hat&quot; was released separately, and as part of &quot;The Fred and Ginger Collection, Vol. 1&quot; from Universal Studios, which controls the rights to the RKO Astaire-Rogers pictures in the UK. In both releases, the film features an introduction by Ava Astaire McKenzie.

In 2005, a digitally restored version of &quot;Top Hat&quot;, different from the Region 2 restoration, was released on Region 1 DVD separately and as part of &quot;The Astaire &amp; Rogers Collection, Vol.1&quot; from Warner Home Video. In both cases, the film features a commentary by Astaire&#x27;s daughter, Ava Astaire McKenzie, and Larry Billman, author of &quot;Fred Astaire, a Bio-bibliography.&quot;

<doc id="61502" wikidata="Q40483" url="?curid=61502" title="List of popes">
<text>This chronological list of popes of the Catholic Church corresponds to that given in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; under the heading &quot;I Sommi Pontefici Romani&quot; (The Roman Supreme Pontiffs), excluding those that are explicitly indicated as antipopes. Published every year by the Roman Curia, the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; no longer identifies popes by regnal number, stating that it is impossible to decide which pope represented the legitimate succession at various times. The 2001 edition of the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; introduced &quot;almost 200 corrections to its existing biographies of the popes, from St Peter to John Paul II&quot;. The corrections concerned dates, especially in the first two centuries, birthplaces and the family name of one pope.

The term &quot;pope&quot; () is used in several churches to denote their high spiritual leaders (for example Coptic pope). This title in English usage usually refers to the head of the Catholic Church. The Catholic pope uses various titles by tradition, including &quot;Summus Pontifex&quot;, &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot;, and &quot;Servus servorum Dei&quot;. Each title has been added by unique historical events and unlike other papal prerogatives, is not incapable of modification.

Hermannus Contractus may have been the first historian to number the popes continuously. His list ends in 1049 with Leo IX as number 154. Several changes were made to the list during the 20th century. Christopher was considered a legitimate pope for a long time but was removed due to how he obtained the papacy. Pope-elect Stephen was listed as Stephen II until the 1961 edition, when his name was removed. The decisions of the Council of Pisa (1409) were reversed in 1963 in a reinterpretation of the Western Schism, extending Gregory XII&#x27;s pontificate to 1415 and classifying rival claimants Alexander V and John XXIII as antipopes.

A significant number of these popes have been recognized as saints, including 48 out of the first 50 consecutive popes, and others are in the sainthood process. Of the first 31 popes, 28 died as martyrs.

== Chronological list of popes ==
=== 1st millennium ===
==== 1st century ====
The chronology of the early popes is heavily disputed. The first ancient lists of popes were not written until the late 2nd century, after the monarchical episcopate had already developed in Rome. These first lists combined contradictory traditions, and even the succession of the first popes is disputed. The first certain dates are AD 222 and 235, the elections of Urban I and Liberius. The years given for the first 30 popes follow the work of Richard Adelbert Lipsius, which often show a 3-year difference with the traditional dates given by Eusebius of Caesarea. These are also the dates used by the Catholic Encyclopedia.

 Longest-lived pope on record. Died on 31 December 2022, in the Vatican, aged 95.

== Religious orders ==
51 popes and 6 antipopes (in italics) have been members of religious orders, including 12 members of third orders. They are listed by order as follows:
== Numbering of popes ==
Regnal numbers follow the usual convention for European monarchs. The first pope who chooses a unique name is not usually identified by an ordinal, John Paul I being the exception. Antipopes are treated as pretenders, and their numbers are reused by those considered to be legitimate popes. However, there are anomalies in the numbering of the popes. Several numbers were mistakenly increased in the Middle Ages because the records were misunderstood. Several antipopes were also kept in the sequence, either by mistake or because they were previously considered to be true popes.

* Alexander: Antipope Alexander V (1409–1410) was listed in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; as a legitimate pope until the 20th century, when the Pisan popes were reclassified as antipopes. There had already been three more Alexanders by then, so there is now a gap in the numbering sequence.
* Benedict: Antipope Benedict X (1058–1059) was kept in the numbering sequence.
* Boniface: Antipope Boniface VII (974 and 984–985) was kept in the numbering sequence.
* Donus: The name has only been used by one pope. The apocryphal Pope Donus II resulted from confusion between the Latin word &quot;dominus&quot; (lord) and the name Donus.
* Felix: Antipope Felix II (356–357) was kept in the numbering sequence.
* John: The numbering of the Popes John is particularly confused. In the modern sequence, they are identified by the numbers they used during their reigns.
** Antipope John XVI (997–998) was kept in the numbering sequence.
** Pope John XXI (1276–1277) chose to skip the number XX, believing that there had been another Pope John between XIV and XV. In reality, John XIV had been counted twice.
** By the 16th century, the numbering error had been conflated with legends about a female Pope Joan, whom some authors called John VIII. She was never listed in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;.
** Antipope John XXIII (1410–1415) was listed in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; as a legitimate pope until the 20th century. After the Pisan popes were classified as antipopes, Pope John XXIII (1958–1963) chose to reuse the number, citing &quot;twenty-two [sic] Johns of indisputable legitimacy.&quot;
* Martin: Pope Martin I (649–655) is followed by Martin IV (1281–1285). Due to the similarity between the Latin names &quot;Marinus&quot; and &quot;Martinus&quot;, Marinus I and Marinus II were mistakenly considered to be Martin II and III.
* Stephen: Pope-elect Stephen (752) died before being consecrated. He was previously known as Stephen II, but the Vatican removed him from the official list of popes in 1961. The remaining Stephens are now numbered Pope Stephen II (752–757) to Pope Stephen IX (1057–1058).

<text>The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople () is the archbishop of Constantinople and (first among equals) among the heads of the several autocephalous churches that comprise the Eastern Orthodox Church. The ecumenical patriarch is regarded as the representative and spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide. The term &quot;ecumenical&quot; in the title is a historical reference to the Ecumene, a Greek designation for the civilised world, i.e. the Roman Empire, and it stems from Canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon.

The patriarch&#x27;s see, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is one of the most enduring institutions in the world and has had a prominent part in world history. The ecumenical patriarchs in ancient times helped in the spread of Christianity and the resolution of various doctrinal disputes. In the Middle Ages, they played a major role in the affairs of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as in the politics of the Orthodox world, and in spreading Christianity among the Slavs. Currently, in addition to the expansion of the Christian faith and the Eastern Orthodox doctrine, the patriarchs are involved in ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, charitable work, and the defense of Orthodox Christian traditions.

Within the five apostolic sees of the Pentarchy, the ecumenical patriarch is regarded as the successor of Andrew the Apostle. The current holder of the office is Bartholomew I, the 270th bishop of that see.

==Status in the Orthodox Church==


The ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople is first among equals, or first in honor among all Eastern Orthodox bishops, who presides in person—or through a delegate—over any council of Orthodox primates or bishops in which he takes part and serves as primary spokesman for the Orthodox communion especially in ecumenical contacts with other Christian denominations. He has no direct jurisdiction over the other patriarchs or the other autocephalous Orthodox churches, but he, alone among his fellow primates, enjoys the right of convening extraordinary synods consisting of them or their delegates to deal with &quot;ad hoc&quot; situations and has also convened well-attended pan-Orthodox synods in the last 40 years. His unique role often sees the ecumenical patriarch referred to as the spiritual leader of the Orthodox Church in some sources, though this is not an official title of the patriarch nor is it usually used in scholarly sources on the patriarchate. The Orthodox Church is entirely decentralized: it has no central authority, earthly head, or single bishop in a leadership role. Because it has a synodical system canonically, it is significantly distinguished from the hierarchically organized Catholic Church, whose doctrine is papal supremacy and whose head is the pope. His titles &quot;primus inter pares&quot;. &#x27;first among equals&#x27;, and &quot;ecumenical patriarch&quot; are of honor rather than authority, and in fact the ecumenical patriarch has no real authority over churches other than the Constantinopolitan.

The ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople is the direct administrative superior of dioceses and archdioceses serving millions of Greek, Ukrainian, Rusyn and Albanian believers in North and South America, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, South Korea, as well as parts of modern Greece which, for historical reasons, do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Church of Greece.

His actual position is patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Constantinople, one of the fourteen autocephalous and several autonomous churches and the most senior (though not oldest) of the four orthodox ancient primatial sees among the five patriarchal Christian centers comprising the ancient Pentarchy of the undivided Church. In his role as head of the Orthodox Church of Constantinople, he is known as the &quot;archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome&quot;.

The Ecumenical Patriarchate is also sometimes called the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople to distinguish it from the Armenian Patriarchate and the extinct Latin Patriarchate, which was created after the Latin capture of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.

===History===
The see of Byzantium, whose foundation was later ascribed to Andrew the Apostle, was originally a common bishopric. It gained importance when Emperor Constantine elevated Byzantium to a second capital alongside Rome and named it Constantinople. The see&#x27;s ecclesiastical status as the second of five patriarchates were developed by the Ecumenical Councils of Constantinople in 381 and Chalcedon in 451.

The Turkish government recognizes him as the spiritual leader of the Greek minority in Turkey, but does not recognize the title &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch&quot;, instead referring to him as the Roman (literally &quot;Rûm&quot;) Orthodox patriarch of Fener (). The patriarch was subject to the authority of the Ottoman Empire after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, until the declaration of Turkish Republic in 1923. Today, according to Turkish law, he is subject to the authority of the state of Turkey and is required to be a citizen of Turkey to be patriarch.

The patriarch of Constantinople has been dubbed the ecumenical patriarch since the sixth century. The exact significance of the style, which has been used occasionally for other prelates since the middle of the fifth century, is nowhere officially defined but, according to the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, the title has been criticized in the Catholic Church as incompatible with the claims of the Holy See.

===Mount Athos===
The monastic communities of Mount Athos are stauropegic and they are directly under the jurisdiction of the ecumenical patriarch, the only bishop who has jurisdiction over them. Athos, officially the &quot;Autonomous Monastic State of the Holy Mountain&quot; (), is a self-governed polity within the Greek state subject to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its political aspect and to the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople as regards to its religious aspect and is home to 20 monasteries and numerous other monastic communities.

==Episcopacy role==
The ecumenical patriarch has a unique role among Eastern Orthodox bishops, though it is not without its controversy. He is (&quot;first among equals&quot;), as he is senior among all Orthodox bishops. This primacy, expressed in canonical literature as &quot;presbeia&quot; (&quot;prerogatives&quot;, literally: &quot;seniorities&quot;), grants to the ecumenical patriarch the right to preside at pan-Orthodox synods.

Additionally, the canonical literature of the Orthodox Church grants to the ecumenical patriarch the right to hear appeals in cases of dispute between bishops. However, whether these canonical rights are limited only to his own patriarchate or are universal throughout the Orthodox Church is the subject of debate, especially between the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Russian Orthodox Church.

Historically, the ecumenical patriarch has heard such appeals and sometimes was invited to intervene in other churches&#x27; disputes and difficulties. Even as early as the fourth century, Constantinople was instrumental in the deposition of multiple bishops outside its traditional jurisdiction. This still occurs today, as when in 2006 the patriarchate was invited to assist in declaring Chrysostomos I of Cyprus, the archbishop of the Church of Cyprus, incompetent due to his having Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Additionally, in 2005, the Ecumenical Patriarchate convoked a pan-Orthodox synod to express the Orthodox world&#x27;s confirmation of the deposition of Patriarch Irenaios of Jerusalem. In 2006, the patriarchate was invited to hear the appeal of a Russian Orthodox bishop in the United Kingdom in a dispute with his superior in Moscow, though the result of that appeal – and the right to make it – were both rejected by the latter.

The ecumenical patriarch has no direct jurisdiction outside the Patriarchate of Constantinople granted to him in Orthodox canonical literature, but his primary function regarding the whole Orthodox Church is one of dealing with relations between autocephalous and autonomous churches. That is, his primary role is one of promoting and sustaining Church unity.

This unique role often sees the ecumenical patriarch referred to as the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of the Orthodox Church in some sources, though this is not an official title of the patriarch nor is it usually used in scholarly sources on the patriarchate. Such a title is acceptable if it refers to this unique role, but it sometimes leads to the mistaken belief that the office is thus the equivalent of an Orthodox pope. There is, however, no Orthodox notion equivalent to the papacy: the Orthodox churches operate in the synodical system, whereby ecclesiastical matters are settled by the competent synod of bishops, in which each bishop has one vote. The five patriarchs of the ancient Pentarchy (Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, in that order) are to be given seniority of honour, but have no actual power over other bishops other than the power of the synod they are chairing (and in which they also wield one vote).

In 2007, the patriarch gave his approval to the Ravenna Document, a Catholic–Orthodox document re-asserting that the bishop of Rome is indeed the &quot;prōtos&quot; (&quot;first&quot;) of the Church, as in &quot;first among equals&quot;, although future discussions are to be held on the concrete ecclesiological exercise of papal primacy. According to &quot;Lumen Gentium&quot;, the patriarch is a validly consecrated bishop in Roman ecclesiology, and there is merely an imperfect ecclesial communion between Constantinople and Rome, which exists nevertheless and which may be improved at some point in history.

== Title ==
The Ecumenical Patriarch bears the name: &quot;(name), by the grace of God Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch&quot;.

==Early history==
The (arch)bishopric of Constantinople has had a continuous history since the founding of the city in AD 330 by Constantine the Great. After Constantine the Great had enlarged Byzantium to make it into a second capital city in 330, it was thought appropriate that its bishop, once a suffragan of the Exarch of Thrace and Macedonia, the Metropolitan of Heraclea, should be elevated to an archbishopric. For many decades the heads of the church of Rome opposed this ambition, due to their existing papal claims, and because they defended the &#x27;Petrine principle&#x27; by which all Patriarchates were derived from Saint Peter and were unwilling to violate the old order of the hierarchy for political reasons.
In 381, the First Council of Constantinople declared that &quot;The Bishop of Constantinople shall have the primacy of honour after the Bishop of Rome, because it is New Rome&quot; (canon iii). The prestige of the office continued to grow not only because of the obvious patronage of the Byzantine Emperor but because of its overwhelming geographical importance.

The Council of Chalcedon in 451 established Constantinople as a patriarchate with ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Asia Minor (the dioceses of Asiane and Pontus) and Thrace as well as over the barbaric territories, non-converted lands outside the defined area of the Western Patriarchate (Old Rome) and the other three patriarchates, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, gave it appellate jurisdiction extraterritorially over canon law decisions by the other patriarchs and granted it honours equal to those belonging to the first Christian see, Rome, in terms of primacy, Rome retaining however its seniority (canon xxviii). Leo I refused to accept this canon, basing himself on the fact that it was made in the absence of his legates. In the sixth century, the official title became that of &quot;archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and ecumenical patriarch&quot;.

The current patriarch (since 1991) is Bartholomew I who has become better-known than any of his predecessors in modern times as a result of his numerous pastoral and other visits to numerous countries in five continents and his setting up of a permanent bureau at the EU headquarters, in addition to enhancing the long-established Patriarchal Centre in Pregny-Chambésy, Switzerland, and also his ecological pursuits which have won him the epithet of &quot;the Green Patriarch&quot;.

== Ottoman ethnarchy ==
When the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople in 1453, the patriarchate ceased to function. The Patriarchate was restored by the conquering ruler, Sultan Mehmed II, who wished to establish his dynasty as the direct heirs of the Eastern Roman emperors, and who adopted the imperial title &quot;Kayser-i-Rûm&quot; &quot;caesar of the Romans&quot;, one of his subsidiary titles but a significant one. In 1454 he bestowed the office upon an illustrious Byzantine scholar-monk who was well known for his opposition to union with the Latin West, Gennadius Scholarius, who became Patriarch Gennadius II.

The patriarch was designated &quot;millet-başı&quot; (ethnarch) of the Millet of &quot;Rum&quot;, which included all Orthodox Christians under Ottoman rule, regardless of their ethnicity in the modern sense. This role was carried out by ethnic Greeks at their great peril, in the midst of enormous difficulties and traps and inevitably with mixed success. Several patriarchs were summarily executed by the Ottoman authorities, most notably Gregory V, who was lynched on Easter Monday 1821 in revenge for the outbreak of the Greek Revolution.

In the 19th century, the rising tide of nationalism and secularism among the Balkan Christian nations led to the establishment of several autocephalous national churches, generally under autonomous patriarchs or archbishops, leaving the ecumenical patriarch only direct control over the ethnically Greek-originated Orthodox Christians of Turkey, parts of Greece and the archdioceses in North America, Asia, Africa and Oceania where growing Greek and other migrant communities have gradually constituted a significant orthodox diaspora.

== Relationship with the Republic of Turkey ==
After the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923, the Turkish state only recognises the patriarch as the spiritual leader of the Greek minority in Turkey, and officially refers to him as the &quot;Greek Orthodox Patriarch of the Phanar&quot; or &quot;Roman Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople&quot; (; Phanar is the neighbourhood in Istanbul where the patriarchate is located). According to Turkish law, still in force today, he is subject to the authority of the Republic of Turkey; however, Turkey allows the Standing Synod of Metropolitan Bishops to elect the patriarch. To be electable, Turkish law requires the candidates to be Turkish citizens. Since the establishment of modern Turkey, the position of the ecumenical patriarch has been filled by Turkish-born citizens of Greek ethnicity. As nearly all Greek Orthodox have left Turkey (see Population exchange between Greece and Turkey and Istanbul Pogrom), this considerably narrows the field of candidates for succession.

Human rights groups have long protested against conditions placed by the secular government of Turkey on the ecumenical patriarch, a religious office. The same policy also applied to the institution of the Islamic Caliphate, which was abolished by Turkey. For example, the ecumenical status accorded him traditionally within Eastern Orthodoxy, and recognized previously by the Ottoman governments, has on occasion been a source of controversy within the Republic of Turkey. This policy results in problems in the function of the patriarchate, since clergy coming from abroad are not eligible to apply for residence and work permits. In its early days the Turkish state promoted a rival Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate, whose congregation, however, has remained limited.

Expropriation of Church property and the conditions of state control imposed on the Orthodox Theological School of Halki that have led to its closure by the Patriarchate, are also cited by human rights groups. However, in 2004 Patriarch Bartholomew, with the help of the Turkish government, succeeded, after eighty years, in altering the composition of the twelve-member Standing Synod of Metropolitan Bishops in Constantinople so that it can include six bishops from outside Turkey. He has also been convening biennially in Constantinople convocations of all bishops in his jurisdiction.

The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople has suffered attacks from 1993 to 2004, including desecration of patriarchal cemeteries as well as assaults on the ecumenical patriarch.

After the protests from Turkey, the signature of the Ecumenical Patriarchate has been removed from the statement of the June 2024 Ukraine peace summit.

<text>The following is a chronological list of bishops and ecumenical patriarchs of Constantinople. The first 25 bishops are probably not historical figures, and the foundation of the See by Andrew the Apostle is almost certainly a later tradition. The list is mostly based on the compilation made by Demetrius Kiminas, but there is no single &quot;official&quot; numbering of bishops. The official website of the patriarchate has a list of holders but gives them no numeral.

== Bishops of Byzantium (until 330 AD) ==
*1. St. Andrew the Apostle (36–38), founder
*2. St. Stachys the Apostle (38–54)
*3. St. Onesimus (54–68)
*4. Polycarpus I (69–89)
*5. Plutarch (89–105)
*6. Sedecion (105–114)
*7. Diogenes (114–129)
*8. Eleutherius (129–136)
*9. Felix (136–141)
*10. Polycarpus II (141–144)
*11. Athenodorus (144–148)
*12. Euzois (148–154)
*13. Laurence (154–166)
*14. Alypius (166–169)
*15. Pertinax (169–187)
*16. Olympianus (187–198)
*17. Marcus I (198–211)
*18. Philadelphus (211–217)
*19. Cyriacus I (217–230)
*20. St. Castinus (230–237)
*21. Eugenius I (237–242)
*22. Titus (242–272)
*23. Dometius (272–284)
*24. Rufinus (284–293)
*25. Probus (293–306)
*26. St. Metrophanes (306–314), first bishop of Byzantium supported by historical sources
*27. St. Alexander (314–330), also first bishop of Constantinople

== Archbishops/Patriarchs of Constantinople ==
The official title of the bishop became &quot;archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and ecumenical patriarch&quot; in the 6th century, but scholars often use the terms &quot;archbishop&quot; and &quot;patriarch&quot; for earlier bishops. The First Council of Constantinople (381) concluded that &quot;the bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honor after the bishop of Rome&quot;, while the Council of Chalcedon (451) concluded that &quot;the bishop of New Rome shall enjoy the same privileges as the bishop of Old Rome&quot;. Modern scholars use the term &quot;patriarch&quot; after either 381 or 451. The chronology mostly follows Demetrius Kiminas (2009), who mostly uses the dates established by Venance Grumel (1958). See also the lists in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium&quot; (1991) and the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Byzantine Empire&quot; (2015).

=== 330 – 450 ===
=== 450 – 800 ===
During the 16th session of the Council of Chalcedon (October–November 451), also known as the Fourth Ecumenical Council, a resolution was passed elevating the See of Constantinople to a status equal to Rome in ecclesiastical matters, granting it second place after Rome. The resolution was formally rejected by the Pope Leo I (Leo the Great) and the Western church; however, was largely accepted in the East, becoming known as Canon 28. This canon would later become the foundation of the Pentarchy of patriarchates.
=== 800 – 1060 ===
In 1054, the Eastern Orthodox Church cut ties to the Roman Catholic Church as a result of the Great East–West Schism.

=== 1060 – 1204 ===
=== 1208 – 1261 (in Nicaea) ===
On 12 April 1204, the Fourth Crusade sacked and conquered Constantinople. The Crusaders established their own line of Catholic patriarchs in the city, while the former Orthodox patriarch John X fled in exile to Thrace. John X died in Thrace in the spring of 1206.

After 1204, various Byzantine warlords struggled to establish their legitimacy and sought to reconquer Constantinople. One of the major contenders, Theodore I Laskaris of Nicaea, sought legitimacy through religion. He invited John X to Nicaea, though the deposed patriarch refused the invitation up until his death. After John&#x27;s death, Laskaris sent letters to Pope Innocent III in hopes of authorizing Orthodox clerics to elect a new Orthodox patriarch and seeking recognition of himself as the supreme head of the Orthodox community, though both requests were ignored by the pope. In 1208, Laskaris nevertheless appointed his own new patriarch, Michael IV of Constantinople, who in turn formally crowned Laskaris as emperor. The appointment of Michael IV was controversial and legally questionable given that only a lawful emperor could appoint a legitimate patriarch and only a legitimate patriarch could crown a lawful emperor. The status of the &quot;Patriarchs of Constantinople&quot; based in Nicaea thus remained disputed outside of the Empire of Nicaea until the reconquest of Constantinople in 1261.
Constantinople was captured by the Empire of Nicaea on 25 July 1261. The Emperor and his court arrived to Constantinople the next month. The Latin (Catholic) Patriarchate of Constantinople continued in exile until 1964.

=== 1261 – 1453 ===
On 29 May 1453 occurred the Fall of Constantinople, thus marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople became subject to the Ottoman Empire.

=== 1453 – 1466 ===

There are different suggestions by scholars for the succession of the Patriarchs from 1462 to 1466, all of whom resigned. The main positions are the following:

According to Kiminas (2009):
* 161. Joasaph I, 1 April 1462 – 10 April 1463
** Gennadius II, April 1463 – June 1463
* 162. Sophronius I, June 1463 – August 1464
** Gennadius II, August 1464 – autumn 1465
* 163. Mark II, autumn 1465 – autumn 1466
* 164. Symeon I, autumn 1466 – end 1466
According to Laurent (1968):
* 161. Joasaph I, April 1462 – April 1463
** Gennadius II, April 1463 – May 1463
* 162. Sophronius I, May 1463 – July 1464
** Gennadius II, August 1464 – autumn 1465
* 163. Symeon I, autumn 1465
* 164. Mark II, begin 1466 – autumn 1466
According to Gemanos of Sardeis (1933–1938):
** Gennadius II, summer 1462 – summer 1463
* 161. Sophronius I, August 1463 – August 1464
** Gennadius II, August 1464 – autumn 1464
* 162. Joasaph I, begin 1465 – begin 1466
* 163. Mark II, begin 1466 – mid 1466
* 164. Symeon I, mid 1466 – end 1466
=== 1466 – 1822 ===
The chronology up to the year 1595 is somewhat disputed by authors.
=== 1822 – 1923 ===
Greece, which was recognized as an independent country in 1830, adopted the modern Gregorian calendar in 1923, followed by Turkey in 1926. The difference between the Gregorian and Julian calendars is of 12 days, meaning that some sources may give a different date depending of the calendar used (see also Old Style and New Style dates). The list follows the Julian dates used at the time in Greece and the Ottoman Empire.

On 23 July 1833, the Church of Greece declared itself autocephalous. It was followed by the Romanian Orthodox Church in 1864, the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1872, and the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1879, thus reducing the territorial extent of the Ecumenical Patriarchate&#x27;s jurisdiction.
On 24 July 1923, the Ottoman Empire was dissolved and replaced by the Republic of Turkey.

<text>Anthony Adverse is a 1936 American epic historical drama film directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Fredric March and Olivia de Havilland. The screenplay by Sheridan Gibney draws elements of its plot from eight of the nine books in Hervey Allen&#x27;s 1933 historical novel, &quot;Anthony Adverse.&quot; Abandoned at a convent as an infant, Anthony comes of age in the tumultuous turn of the 18th to the 19th century, the age of Napoleon. The audience is privy to many truths in Anthony&#x27;s life, including the tragic story of his origins and the fact that the wealthy merchant who adopts him is his grandfather. Most important of all, Anthony believes that his beloved Angela abandoned him without a word, when in fact she left a note telling him that the theatrical troupe was going to Rome. The gust of wind that blows the note away is one of many fateful and fatal events in Anthony&#x27;s story.

The film received four Academy Awards, including the inaugural Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, given to Gale Sondergaard for her performance as the villainous Faith Paleologus.

==Plot==
In 1773, young Scottish woman Maria Bonnyfeather is the new bride of middle-aged Spanish Marquis Don Luis. The consummation of their marriage is postponed until he is cured of gout at a famous spa. Meanwhile, Maria&#x27;s true love, Denis Moore, follows them and stays near their château. While the marquis is away taking the cure, they meet in the woods, and after three months Maria tells him she is carrying his child. The marquis returns home, cured, and Maria is horrified at what awaits her. The lovers plan to flee that night, but the marquis discovers Maria waiting for Denis. Don Luis takes her away, but Denis pursues them to an inn, where Don Luis kills him in a sword duel.

Months later, Maria dies giving birth to her son at a chalet in the Italian Alps. Don Luis leaves the infant in the foundling wheel of a convent near Leghorn. The nuns christen him Anthony because he was found on the feast day of St. Anthony the Great. Don Luis lies to Maria&#x27;s father, wealthy merchant John Bonnyfeather, telling him that the infant also died. Ten years later, by chance, Anthony is apprenticed to Bonnyfeather, who discovers his relationship to the boy but keeps it a secret. The only explanation for Don Luis’ behavior is that Maria&#x27;s child was illegitimate, and Bonnyfeather cannot bear to have his daughter—or his grandson—bear that stigma. He gives the boy the surname Adverse acknowledging the difficult start in life.

Anthony and the cook&#x27;s daughter, Angela Guisseppi fall in love. Angela wants to become a great singer. Anthony wants to serve Bonnyfeather and marry Angela, but Angela&#x27;s father wins the lottery and the family leaves Leghorn. Years later, Anthony finds her, singing in the opera chorus. Eventually, they wed. Soon after the ceremony, Bonnyfeather sends Anthony to Havana to save Bonnyfeather&#x27;s fortune from a laggard debtor, the trading firm Gallego &amp; Sons. On the day his ship sails, he and Angela are supposed to meet at the convent, but she arrives first, and he is late. Unable to wait any longer, she leaves a note outside the convent to inform him that she is leaving for Rome with her opera company, but the note is blown away. Confused and upset, he sails without her. Meanwhile, assuming he has abandoned her, she continues her career.

Gallego has quit Havana. Anthony leaves to take control of Gallego &amp; Sons&#x27; only remaining asset—a slave trading post on the Pongo River in Africa, so he can recover Bonnyfeather&#x27;s debt. Three years in the slave trade corrupts him, and he takes slave girl Neleta into his bed. After his friend, Brother François, is crucified and killed by natives, Anthony returns to Italy to find Bonnyfeather has died. His housekeeper, Faith Paleologus (Don Luis&#x27; longtime co-conspirator and now wife), has inherited Bonnyfeather&#x27;s fortune.

Anthony goes to Paris to claim his inheritance and is reunited with his friend, banker Vincent Nolte. He saves Nolte from bankruptcy by loaning him his entire fortune, having learned from Brother François that &quot;There&#x27;s something besides money and power&quot;. Meanwhile, all Paris is buzzing with gossip about Mademoiselle Georges, the famous opera star and mistress of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the diamond necklace he has given to her, although Josephine wanted it.

Impresario Debrulle reunites Anthony with Angela, who bore him a son. A delighted Angela tells him that she is singing at the opera, and he goes, with Nolte. Searching the program in vain for her name, he hears her voice coming from the stage. He exclaims, “That&#x27;s Angela” and Nolte replies, “That&#x27;s Mademoiselle Georges!” Angela continues the aria and emerges from the shadows, descending a staircase. Wearing Napoleon&#x27;s gift, she whispers “Goodbye, Anthony,” as he stands and leaves the box.

Shaken, he returns home to find his son, with a letter from Angela saying that Anthony is better suited to raise the boy. Anthony and the boy sail for America hoping for a better life.

==Production==

Before casting Frederic March to costar with Olivia de Havilland, Warner Bros. considered Robert Donat, Leslie Howard, and George Brent for the title role. The studio during preproduction also intended to cast Errol Flynn in support of March, but Flynn became so popular with moviegoers after his performance in &quot;Captain Blood&quot; in 1935 that Warner Bros. assigned him to star instead in the 1936 film &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;.

Billy Mauch plays the young Anthony Adverse in the earlier scenes. Warner Bros. discovered Mauch had a twin, and it put them both under contract. They were given a starring vehicle in &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;.

Film editor Ralph Dawson provided some statistics: a shooting script of 250 pages; 1,098 camera set-ups, plus another 200 scenes prepared by special effects (including superimposed titles); 600,000+ feet of positive print film delivered to his cutting room, yielding a finished film of 12,250 feet.

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===

In his 1936 review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Frank S. Nugent panned &quot;Warner&#x27;s gargantuan film&quot;:

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Graham Greene expressed similar views, acerbically noting of the film that it &quot;goes on too long, otherwise it might have been the funniest film since &quot;The Crusades&quot;&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;a bit choppy&quot; and &quot;a bit long-winded&quot; as well; but the popular trade magazine praised Fredric March&#x27;s performance, adding that he was &quot;an ace choice, playing the role to the hilt.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote that &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; &quot;easily ranks among the leading pictures of the talking screen&quot; and called the production&#x27;s acting &quot;flawless&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t think Mr. March has done any better piece of work than this&quot;, noted John Mosher in his positive review for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

The film was named one of the National Board of Review&#x27;s Top Ten pictures of the year and ranked eighth in the &quot;Film Daily&quot; annual critics&#x27; poll. In a much later review, however, Reverend Austin Spencer also found the film adaptation—when compared to the novel—inadequate, especially in its portrayal of the personal challenges that confronted the story&#x27;s protagonist:

On TCM, film critic Leonard Maltin gives the picture a positive review of 3.5/4 stars, praising the &quot;Blockbuster filmization of Hervey Allen bestseller ... of young man gaining maturity through adventures in various parts of early 19th-century Europe, Cuba, and Africa&quot; and the film&#x27;s cinematography and &quot;rousing musical score&quot;, both winners of Academy Awards.

 It is the lowest-rated film to ever be nominated for Best Picture film on the website.

===Box office===
The film was Warner Bros.&#x27; most popular release of 1936. It was also the studio&#x27;s most expensive production that year, with an overall budget of $1,192,000. That hefty expense, however, proved to be a wise investment, for &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; generated $1,558,000 in profits at the box office for Warner Bros., earning the studio $1,783,000 domestically and $967,000 in foreign markets.

==Cultural references==

The initial theme of the second movement of Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#x27;s violin concerto was drawn from the music he composed for the film.

English singer Julia Gilbert adopted the name of the film&#x27;s main character when recording for the London-based él record label in the late 1980s.

Screen legend Tony Curtis (1925–2010), who was born Bernard Schwartz, named himself for the titular character: The novel from which this film was adapted was the actor&#x27;s favorite. Curtis, who was established as a star in &quot;The Prince Who Was a Thief&quot; (1951), was buried with a Stetson hat, an Armani scarf, driving gloves, an iPhone and a copy of his favorite novel &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot;.

Jack Benny parodied &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; on the October 11 and 18 episodes of his &quot;Jell-O Show&quot; in 1936.

In the 1934 short comedy &quot;What, No Men!&quot;, when their plane lands in &quot;Indian Country&quot; and Gus (El Brendel) is told to throw out the anchor, he tosses out a rope attached to a huge book titled &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot;.

In the 1949 cartoon &quot;Hare Do&quot;, a marquee at a theater advertises the movie.

<doc id="61506" wikidata="Q2783135" url="?curid=61506" title="Dodsworth (novel)">
<text>Dodsworth is a satirical novel by American writer Sinclair Lewis, first published by Harcourt Brace &amp; Company on March 14, 1929. Its subject, the differences between US and European intellect, manners, and morals, is one that frequently appears in the works of Henry James. In 1936 it was made into a movie, &quot;Dodsworth&quot;, which received seven Academy Award nominations and has been regarded as historically significant by the Library of Congress.

==Plot==
The novel is set in the period between late 1925 and late 1927. Samuel (&#x27;Sam&#x27;) Dodsworth is an ambitious and innovative automobile designer, who builds his fortunes in fictional Zenith, Winnemac, through the success of his Revelation Motor Company. Along the way, he courted and won the hand of Frances &#x27;Fran&#x27; Voelker, a beautiful young socialite. Deciding to retire while he is still capable of enjoying his leisure, he sells out at fifty and sets out to pursue a dream he&#x27;d never allowed himself the time to realize: a leisurely trip to Europe with his wife, with aspirations to visit some manufacturing plants looking for his next challenge. His forty-one-year-old wife, however, motivated by her own vanity and fear of lost youth, is dissatisfied with married life and small town Zenith, and wants to live in Europe permanently as an expatriate, not just visit for a few months. The Dodsworths leave for Europe with Fran. Her disparate motivations for the trip become quickly known.

In their extensive travels across Europe, they are soon caught up in vastly different lifestyles. Fran falls in with a crowd of frivolous socialites, while Sam plays more of an independent tourist. &#x27;With his red Baedeker guide book in hand, he visits such well-known tourist attractions as Westminster Abbey, Notre Dame Cathedral, Sanssouci Palace, and the Piazza San Marco. But the historic sites that he sees prove to be far less significant than the American expatriates that he meets on his extensive journeys across Great Britain and continental Europe&#x27; He meets Edith Cortright, an expatriate American widow in Venice, who is everything his wife is not: self-assured, self-confident, selfless, and self-reliant. As Sam and Fran follow their own pursuits, their relationship is strained to the breaking point. Both are forced to choose between marriage and the new lifestyles they have embraced.

The novel includes detailed descriptions of Sam and Fran&#x27;s tours across Europe. They leave for the Continent via steam liner from New York, landing first in England. They take in London and are invited by Major Clyde Lockert to join a weekend trip to the countryside. Later, after Lockert has made an indecent proposal to Fran, they depart for Paris, where she soon engages in a busy social life and Sam takes up sightseeing. When he decides to go back to America for his college reunion in New Haven, Fran spends the summer months on the Alpine lakes near Montreux and Stresa, where she has a romance with Arnold Israel. Once Sam has picked her up in Paris, they agree to continue their travels together, touring France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Hungary and Germany. Fran next falls in love with nobleman Kurt von Obersdorf in Berlin, and stays on with him while Sam criss-crosses Europe attempting to cope with the breakdown of his marriage. When he happens to run into Edith in Venice, she persuades him to accompany her on a visit to a village in the vicinity of Naples. Von Obersdorf calls off the marriage, and Sam joins Fran on her voyage back to New York. Three days later, he is back on the next ship to meet Edith in Paris.

<text>Libeled Lady is a 1936 American screwball comedy film directed by Jack Conway and starring Jean Harlow, William Powell, Myrna Loy, and Spencer Tracy. The screenplay was written by Maurine Dallas Watkins, Howard Emmett Rogers, and George Oppenheimer, from a story by Wallace Sullivan. This was the fifth of fourteen films in which Powell and Loy were teamed, inspired by their success in the &quot;Thin Man&quot; series.

&quot;Libeled Lady&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film was remade in 1946 as &quot;Easy to Wed&quot; with Esther Williams, Van Johnson, and Lucille Ball.

==Plot==
Wealthy Connie Allenbury is falsely accused of breaking up a marriage and sues the &quot;New York Evening Star&quot; newspaper for $5 million for libel. Warren Haggerty, the managing editor, turns in desperation to former reporter and suave ladies&#x27; man Bill Chandler for help. Bill&#x27;s scheme is to maneuver Connie into being alone with him when his wife shows up, so that the suit will have to be dropped. Bill is not married, so Warren volunteers his long-suffering fiancée, Gladys Benton, to marry Bill in name only, over her loud protests.

Bill arranges to return to the United States from England on the same ocean liner as Connie and her father J. B. He pays some men to pose as reporters and harass Connie at the dock, so that he can &quot;rescue&quot; her and become acquainted. On the voyage, Connie initially treats him with contempt, assuming that he is just the latest in a long line of fortune hunters after her money, but Bill gradually overcomes her suspicions.

Complications arise when Connie and Bill actually fall in love. They get married, but Gladys decides that she prefers Bill to a marriage-averse newspaperman and interrupts their honeymoon to reclaim her husband. Bill reveals that he found out that Gladys was married before and that her Yucatán divorce was invalid, thus rendering their own marriage invalid. But Gladys reveals she obtained a second divorce in Reno, so she and Bill are legally husband and wife. Connie and Bill manage to show Gladys that she really loves Warren.

==Production==
The film went into production in mid-July 1936 and wrapped on September 1. Location shooting took place in Sonora, California. Lionel Barrymore was originally cast as Mr. Allenbury, and Rosalind Russell was originally considered to play Connie Allenbury.

Harlow and Powell were an off-screen couple, and Harlow wanted to play Connie Allenbury, so that her character and Powell&#x27;s wound up together. MGM insisted, however, that the film be another William Powell-Myrna Loy vehicle, as they originally intended. Harlow had already signed on to do the film but had to settle for the role of Gladys Benton. Nevertheless, as Gladys, top-billed Harlow got to play a wedding scene with Powell. During filming, Harlow changed her legal name from Harlean Carpenter McGrew Bern Rosson to Jean Harlow. She made only two more films before dying at the age of 26 in 1937.

Tracy had previously been enamoured with Loy, who was newly married to Arthur Hornblow Jr. at the time of this production. Loy’s autobiography recounted the humorous atmosphere on the set. For example, Tracy set up an &quot;I hate Hornblow&quot; table in the studio commissary, reserved for men who claimed to have been romantically rejected by Loy.

Two passenger liners made cameos as the ship in the film, the SS &quot;Queen Anne&quot;: Cunard&#x27;s RMS &quot;Berengaria&quot; (in the pierside view) and France&#x27;s SS &quot;Normandie&quot; in an aerial shot.

==Reception==
The film was released on 9 October 1936, and earned $2.7 million at the box office — $1,601,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,122,000 in other markets, resulting in a profit of $1,189,000. It was one of the top twenty box-office successes of the year.

It received an Academy Award nomination for 1936 Best Picture.

<text>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is a 1936 American comedy-drama romance film directed by Frank Capra and starring Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur in her first featured role. Based on the 1935 short story &quot;Opera Hat&quot; by Clarence Budington Kelland, which appeared in serial form in &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, the screenplay was written by Robert Riskin in his fifth collaboration with Capra.

==Plot==
Longfellow Deeds is the co-owner of a tallow works, part-time greeting card poet, and tuba-playing inhabitant of the hamlet of Mandrake Falls, Vermont. During the Great Depression he inherits 20 million dollars from his uncle, Martin Semple. Semple&#x27;s scheming attorney, John Cedar, locates Deeds and brings him to New York City. Cedar gives his cynical troubleshooter, ex-newspaperman Cornelius Cobb, the task of keeping reporters away from Deeds.

Cobb is outfoxed by star reporter Louise &quot;Babe&quot; Bennett, who appeals to Deeds&#x27; romantic fantasy of rescuing a damsel in distress by masquerading as a poor worker named Mary Dawson. She pretends to faint from exhaustion after &quot;walking all day to find a job&quot; and worms her way into his confidence. Bennett proceeds to write a series of enormously popular newspaper articles on Longfellow, portraying him as a madcap yokel who has suddenly inherited riches, giving him the nickname &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;.

Cedar tries to get Deeds&#x27; power of attorney in order to keep his own financial misdeeds secret. Deeds, however, proves to be a shrewd judge of character, easily fending off Cedar and other greedy opportunists. He wins Cobb&#x27;s wholehearted respect and eventually Babe&#x27;s love, falling for her himself and proposing in a poem. She quits her job in shame, but before she can tell Deeds the truth about herself, Cobb finds out and tells Deeds. Deeds is left heartbroken and decides to return to Mandrake Falls.

After he has packed and is about to leave, a dispossessed farmer stomps into his mansion and threatens him with a gun. He expresses his scorn for the seemingly heartless, ultra-rich man, who feeds doughnuts to horses but will not lift a finger to help the multitudes of desperate poor. After the intruder comes to his senses, Deeds realizes that he can put his troublesome fortune to good use. He decides to provide 2,000 fully equipped farms free to homeless families if they will work the land for three years.

Cedar joins forces with Deeds&#x27; only other relative, Semple, and his shrewish wife, in an attempt to have Deeds declared mentally incompetent. A sanity hearing is scheduled to determine who should control the fortune. During the hearing, Cedar calls an expert who diagnoses Deeds with manic depression based on Babe&#x27;s articles and witnesses to his recent behavior. As he has since he was taken into custody, Deeds continues to refuse to speak.

Babe speaks up passionately on his behalf, blaming herself for what she did to him. When he realizes that she truly loves him, he begins speaking, systematically punching holes in Cedar&#x27;s case and then punching Cedar in the face. The judge declares him to be not only sane, but &quot;the sanest man who ever walked into this courtroom&quot;. Victorious, Deeds and Babe embrace and kiss, Deeds sweeping her up into his arms and carrying her off.

==Production==

Originally, Frank Capra intended to make &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; after &quot;Broadway Bill&quot; (1934), but lead actor Ronald Colman could not get out of his other filming commitments. Thus, Capra began adapting &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;. As production began, the two lead actors were cast: Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds and Jean Arthur as Louise &quot;Babe&quot; Bennett/Mary Dawson. Cooper was Capra&#x27;s &quot;first, last and only choice&quot; for the pivotal role of the eccentric Longfellow Deeds.

Arthur was not the first choice for the role, but Carole Lombard, the original female lead, quit the film just three days before principal photography, in favor of a starring role in &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;. The first scenes shot on the Fox Studios&#x27; New England street lot were in place before Capra found his replacement heroine in a rush screening. The opening sequences had to be reshot when Capra decided against the broad comedy approach that had originally been written.

Despite his penchant for coming in &quot;under budget&quot;, Capra spent an additional five shooting days in multiple takes, testing angles and &quot;new&quot; perspectives, treating the production as a type of workshop exercise. Due to the increased shooting schedule, the film came in at $38,936 more than the Columbia budget for a total of $806,774. Throughout pre-production and early principal photography, the project still retained Kelland&#x27;s original title, &quot;Opera Hat&quot;, although Capra tried out some other titles including &quot;A Gentleman Goes to Town&quot; and &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; before settling on a name that was the winning entry in a contest held by the Columbia Pictures publicity department.

==Reception==
The film was generally treated as likable fare by critics and audiences. Novelist Graham Greene, then also a film critic, was effusive in his praise, stating that this was Capra&#x27;s finest film to date and describing Capra&#x27;s treatment as &quot;a kinship with his audience, a sense of common life, a morality&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; noted &quot;a sometimes too thin structure [that] the players and director Frank Capra have contrived to convert ... into fairly sturdy substance&quot;.

This was the first Capra film to be released separately to exhibitors and not &quot;bundled&quot; with other Columbia features. On paper, it was his biggest hit, easily surpassing &quot;It Happened One Night.&quot;

It was the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1935–36. In a 2004 listing compiled by the British Film Institute, &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; was placed at number 88 in their all-time chart based on cinema admissions in the UK, with an estimate attendance of 8.3 million.

== Awards and honors ==
&quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #70
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers – #83

==Adaptations==
A radio adaptation of &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; was originally broadcast on February 1, 1937, on &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;. In that broadcast, Gary Cooper, Jean Arthur and Lionel Stander reprised their roles from the 1936 film.

A planned sequel, titled &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington&quot;, eventually became &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939). Although the latter&#x27;s screenplay was actually based on an unpublished story, &quot;The Gentleman from Montana&quot;, the film was, indeed, meant to be a sequel to &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, with Gary Cooper reprising his role as Longfellow Deeds. Because Cooper was unavailable, Capra then &quot;saw it immediately as a vehicle for Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur&quot;, and Stewart was borrowed from MGM.

The second animated feature film from Fleischer Studios, &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;, was inspired by &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;.

A short-lived ABC television series of the same name ran from 1969 to 1970, starring Monte Markham as Longfellow Deeds.

&quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; was loosely remade as &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; in 2002, starring Adam Sandler and Winona Ryder.

The Bengali movie &quot;Raja-Saja&quot; (1960) starring Uttam Kumar, Sabitri Chatterjee, and Tarun Kumar, and directed by Bikash Roy was a Bengali adaptation of this film.

The 1994 comedy &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; had several plot elements borrowed from this film.

A Japanese manga adaption of &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; was made in 2010 by Ogata Hiromi, titled &quot;Bara no Souzokunin&quot;.

The 1949 Tamil movie &quot;Nallathambi&quot; starring N S Krishnan was an adaptation of &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, aimed at promoting social justice and education.

The 1983 Turkish movie Çarıklı Milyoner inspired from the movie.

==Digital restoration==
In 2013, &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; was slated for 4K-digital restoration and re-release.

==In popular culture==
The bucolic Vermont town of Mandrake Falls, home of Longfellow Deeds, is now considered to be an archetype of small town America, with Clarence Budington Kelland, the author of the original story, having created a type of &quot;cracker-barrel&quot; view of rural values contrasted with that of sophisticated &quot;city folk&quot;. The word &quot;pixilated&quot;, previously limited to New England (and attested there since 1848), &quot;had a nationwide vogue in 1936&quot; thanks to its prominent use in the film, although its use in the screenplay may not be an accurate interpretation.

The word &quot;doodle&quot;, in its modern specific sense of drawing on paper rather than in its older more general sense of &#x27;fooling around&#x27;, may also owe its origin – or at least its entry into common usage – to the final courtroom scene in this film. The Longfellow Deeds character, addressing the judge, explains the concept of a &quot;doodler&quot; – which the judge has not heard before – as being &quot;a word we made up back home to describe someone who makes foolish designs on paper while they&#x27;re thinking.&quot;

The courtroom scene inspired the publication in the year after its release of a book that incorporated both words, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Pixillated: A Book of Doodles&quot;.

The lyrics to the 1977 Rush song &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; on the &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; album are based on the story of &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;.

In the movie &quot;Baby Boom&quot;, a babysitter refers to her hometown of Mandrake Falls.

<text>The Story of Louis Pasteur is a 1936 American black-and-white biographical film from Warner Bros., produced by Henry Blanke, directed by William Dieterle, that stars Paul Muni as the renowned scientist who developed major advances in microbiology, which revolutionized agriculture and medicine. The film&#x27;s screenplay—which tells a highly fictionalized version of Pasteur’s life—was written by Pierre Collings and Sheridan Gibney, and Edward Chodorov (uncredited).

Muni won an Academy Award for Best Actor, while Collings and Gibney won for Best Screenplay and Best Story. The film was nominated for Best Picture.

Muni also won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor from the Venice Film Festival in 1936.

==Plot==
In 1860 Paris, a distraught man murders his wife&#x27;s doctor. Chemist Louis Pasteur (Paul Muni) has publicized the theory that microbes cause diseases. Therefore, doctors should avoid spreading by washing their hands and sterilizing their instruments in boiling water. The doctor did not do this, and the wife died of puerperal fever after giving birth.

France&#x27;s medical academy dismisses Pasteur—notably his most vocal critic, Dr. Charbonnet (Fritz Leiber Sr.)—as a crank whose recommendations are tantamount to witchcraft. Pasteur frankly calls attention to the risks of Charbonnet&#x27;s non-sterile methods and correctly predicts that a member of Napoleon III&#x27;s royal family who Charbonnet is attending will die of puerperal fever. Pasteur is considered dangerous because his ideas have led to murder. When the Emperor comes down against him, Pasteur leaves Paris and moves to Arbois.

In the 1870s, when the new French government tries to restore the economy after the Franco-Prussian War, they learn that many sheep are dying of anthrax, except around Arbois. They send representatives who realize that, after working with a small group of loyal researchers, Pasteur developed an anthrax vaccine.

The medical academy still opposes him and says Arbois must be free of anthrax, so the government buys land there and invites sheep farmers to use it. Pasteur objects strongly, saying the soil is full of anthrax spores, and eventually proposes an experiment. He will vaccinate 25 of the newly arrived sheep; then they and a control group of 25 others will be injected with blood from a sheep with anthrax.

Joseph Lister (Halliwell Hobbes), the pioneer of antiseptic surgery in England, is interested enough to attend. He witnesses Pasteur&#x27;s success as all the vaccinated sheep remain healthy after the other 25 die. At this point, Jean Martel (Donald Woods), a young doctor who was formerly Charbonnet&#x27;s assistant but now follows Pasteur, becomes engaged to Pasteur&#x27;s daughter Annette (Anita Louise).

The celebrations are short-lived, as a rabid dog runs through the town and bites a man. As a woman attempts to cure him by witchcraft, Pasteur laments that doctors would have no more chance of success. Moving back to Paris, he makes rabies his next project. He spreads the disease from one animal to another by injection but cannot detect any microbe being transferred (viruses had not been discovered), and the method he used to create the anthrax vaccine fails.

Charbonnet visits the lab to gloat over Pasteur&#x27;s failure. He is so confident Pasteur is a quack that he injects himself with rabies—and is triumphant, as he does not get the disease. Pasteur is puzzled until his wife Marie (Josephine Hutchinson) suggests the sample may have weakened with age. This sets him on the right path, giving dogs progressively stronger injections.

But before his experiments conclude, a frantic mother begs him to try his untested treatment on her son (Dickie Moore), who a rabid dog has bitten. Despite fearing imprisonment or even execution for Practicing without a license to provide medical treatment, Pasteur decides he must try to save the child. During the attempt, Dr. Zaranoff (Akim Tamiroff) arrives from Russia with a group of peasants exposed to rabies. They have volunteered to receive Pasteur&#x27;s treatment.

Annette goes into labor with Martel&#x27;s child. The doctor to attend to her is unavailable, and the boy urgently needs Martel. Pasteur searches for another doctor, but he can only find Charbonnet. He begs Charbonnet to wash his hands and sterilize his instruments; Charbonnet finally agrees that if Charbonnet lives another month, Pasteur will retract and denounce all his work on rabies. Both men are honorable enough to respect the agreement. The birth goes well, but Pasteur suffers a mild stroke.

Days later, word comes that Pasteur has permission to treat the still-alive Russians. He attends them in hospital for the first injections using a wheelchair and later a cane. The experiment is a success, and now even Charbonnet concedes he was wrong, tearing up Pasteur&#x27;s retraction and asking for the shots himself.

Afterwards, Pasteur hears that Lister will denounce him at the medical academy. He angrily attends, but it is actually a surprise. Lister praises him, Zaranoff presents him with a Russian medal, and the once-skeptical doctors honor him.

==Reception and accolades==
Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, describing it as &quot;an honest, interesting and well-made picture&quot;. Characterizing Paul Muni as &quot;the greatest living actor&quot; and as a &quot;Protean figure&quot;, Greene asserts that Muni&#x27;s depiction of Pasteur is accomplished &quot;with his whole body [to establish] not only the bourgeois, the elderly, the stubborn and bitter and noble little chemist, but his nationality and even his period.&quot;

==Radio adaptations==
Paul Muni reprised his role in two radio play versions of the film: the November 23, 1936 episode of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; and the April 13, 1946 episode of &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot;. The Internet Archive holds this radio adaptation, which can be found in the external links below.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Roman Senate passes the motion &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot;, which the consul Lucius Opimius interprets as giving him unlimited power to preserve the Republic. He gathers an armed force of Senators and their supporters to confront Gaius Gracchus. A pitched battle is fought inside Rome, resulting in the death of Gracchus and many of his followers.
* A tribunal is established in Rome that executes 3,000 followers of Gracchus.
* Consul Quintus Fabius Maximus, allied with the Aedui, defeats the Arverni and Allobroges in Transalpine Gaul, thus establishing the province for Rome.
* The finest vintage of Falernian wine, known as the Opimian vintage, is bottled from vines grown on Mt Falernus between Latium and Campania.

==== China ====
* Spring - The Han general Huo Qubing attacks the Supu, vassals of the Xiongnu, and kills their king. He then invades the Hexi Corridor, where he fights a six-day running battle against a son of Yizhixie Chanyu. The Xiongnu are defeated, and the ruler of Lan and king Lu, both vassals of the Xiongnu, are killed in the fighting. Huo Qubing then attacks and defeats the Hunye, capturing the son of the Hunye king and his ministers and chief commandants.
* Summer - Huo Qubing again invades the Hexi Corridor. In an engagement in the Qilian Mountains, he captures the king of the Qiutu. In a second engagement, he then captures five vassal kings of the Xiongnu and a consort of the Chanyu, killing or capturing more than 30,000 Xiongnu soldiers.
* Generals Li Guang and Zhang Qian ride north from Youbeiping, but Zhang Qian, with the larger army, is slow to rendezvous with Li Guang. As a result, Li Guang loses more than half his army in battle against the Tuqi (Worthy Prince) of the Left (East).
* Autumn - Yizhixie Chanyu plans on executing the Hunye and Xiutu kings for their failures against Huo Qubing, but learning of this, the vassal kings inform the Han of their intention to surrender. Emperor Wu of Han sends Huo Qubing across the Yellow River with an army to oversee their surrender. Some of the enemy troops and leaders then refuse to surrender, but Huo Qubing massacres 8000 of them as they attempt to flee. Huo Qubing receives the surrender of thirty-two Xiongnu vassals, and the Hunye king and other vassals are enfeoffed as marquises in China. 
* The rapid conquest of the Hexi Corridor provides the traditional western provinces of China with greater security. As a result, Emperor Wu halves the number of soldiers garrisoning the provinces of Longxi, Beidi and Shang.

<text>A Tale of Two Cities is a 1935 film based upon Charles Dickens&#x27; 1859 historical novel, &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, set in London and Paris.

The film stars Ronald Colman as Sydney Carton and Elizabeth Allan as Lucie Manette. The supporting players include Edna May Oliver, Reginald Owen, Basil Rathbone, Lucille La Verne, Blanche Yurka, Henry B. Walthall and Donald Woods. It was directed by Jack Conway from a screenplay by W. P. Lipscomb and S. N. Behrman. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Film Editing.

The story is set in France and England and spans several years before and during the French Revolution. It deals with the evils that precipitated the Revolution and with an innocent family and their friends caught up in the horrors of the Terror. Charles Darnay, a French aristocrat who has rejected his rank and moved to England, and Sydney Carton, an alcoholic English advocate, both fall in love with Lucie Manette. Lucie has brought her father to England to recover from 18 years of unjust imprisonment in the Bastille. Lucie befriends Carton and later marries Darnay. In the end, Carton saves Darnay&#x27;s life by taking his place at the guillotine. The film is generally regarded as the best cinematic version of Dickens&#x27; novel and one of the best performances of Colman&#x27;s career.

==Plot==
The film opens with a portion of the famous introduction to the novel: “ It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us... In short, it was a period very like the present...” Lucie Manette (Elizabeth Allan) and her servant and companion Miss Pross (Edna May Oliver) are informed by elderly banker Mr. Jarvis Lorry (Claude Gillingwater) that her father, Dr. Alexandre Mannette (Henry B. Walthall) is not dead, but has been a prisoner in the Bastille for eighteen years before finally being rescued. She travels with Mr. Lorry to Paris to take her father to her home in England. Dr. Manette has been cared for by a former servant, Ernest De Farge (Mitchell Lewis), and his wife (Blanche Yurka) who own a wine shop in Paris. The old man&#x27;s mind has given way during his long ordeal, but Lucie&#x27;s tender care begins to restore his sanity.

On the return trip across the English Channel, Lucie meets Charles Darnay (Donald Woods), a French aristocrat who, unlike his uncle, the Marquis St. Evremonde (Basil Rathbone), is sympathetic to the plight of the oppressed and impoverished French masses. He has denounced his uncle, relinquished his title, changed his name and is going to England to begin a new life. The marquis has Darnay framed for treason, but he is defended by barrister C.J. Stryver (Reginald Owen) and his highly proficient but cynical colleague Sydney Carton (Ronald Colman). Carton goes drinking with Barsad (Walter Catlett), the main prosecution witness and tricks him into admitting that he framed Darnay. When Barsad is called to testify, he is horrified to discover that Carton is a member of the defense. He recants his testimony to save himself, and Darnay is acquitted.

Following the trial, Carton is thanked by Lucie. He quickly falls in love with her. Darnay confesses to Dr. Manette he is the nephew of the Marquis St. Evremonde; Manette forgives him, but reserves the right to tell Lucie himself. On their way to church, Lucie meets Carton and invites him to join them and he accepts. Afterwards, she invites him into their home to celebrate Christmas, but he declines because he has been drinking. Lucie and Carton eventually become close friends. Carton has hopes that Lucie will requite his love, but one day she tells him that she is engaged to Darnay.

Lucie and Darnay marry and have a daughter, also named Lucie, who is very fond of Carton. By this time, the French Revolution is beginning. Charles&#x27; uncle, the Marquis St. Evremond is one of its first victims, stabbed in his sleep by a man whose child had been fatally run down by his coach. The long-suffering peasants vent their fury on the aristocrats, condemning scores daily to Madame Guillotine. Darnay is tricked into returning to Paris and is arrested. Lucie and Dr. Manette travel to Paris to save Darnay. Manette pleads for mercy for his son-in-law, but Madame De Farge, seeking revenge against all the Evremondes, convinces the tribunal to sentence Darnay to death, using a letter Dr. Manette wrote while in prison, cursing and denouncing the entire Evremonde family.

Upon learning of Darnay&#x27;s imprisonment, Carton travels to Paris to comfort Lucie. Carton consults Mr. Lorry and tells him of his plan to rescue Darnay. Carton discovers Barsad is also in Paris and works as a spy in the prisons. Carton overcomes Barsad&#x27;s reluctance to help him with his scheme to rescue Darnay by threatening to reveal that Barsad had been a spy for the Marquis St. Evremonde. Barsad takes Carton to visit Darnay in his cell; Carton renders Darnay unconscious with ether, switches clothes with him, and finishes the letter Darnay has been writing to Lucie and puts it in Darnay&#x27;s pocket. Darnay is carried out of the cell without anyone noticing the switch.

While Lucie prepares to return to England, Madame De Farge goes to provoke her into denouncing the Republic, but she is intercepted by Miss Pross inside the now-vacated apartment. Pross knows why Madame De Farge has come and is determined to stop her. The two women fight and De Farge pulls out a pistol, but in the ensuing struggle, Pross kills her. Darnay, Lucie, little Lucie, Lorry, and Pross all escape safely.

While awaiting execution, a condemned, innocent seamstress (Isabel Jewell) who was sentenced at the same time as Darnay, notices Carton has assumed his identity. She draws comfort from his bravery and sacrifice as they ride together to the guillotine. As Carton stands at the foot of the guillotine, drums roll and then fade away as the camera rises up past the guillotine to the city and the sky above. His voice is heard saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done. It&#x27;s a far, far better rest I go to than I have ever known.&quot;

==Production ==
Filming ran from June 4, 1935, to August 19, 1935 The picture premiered in New York City on December 15, 1935.

The closing credits spell the name De Farge. Dickens spelled it Defarge in the novel.

According to TCM&#x27;s Genevieve McGillicuddy, “Selznick had no trouble finding a lead actor... Ronald Colman had coveted the part since he began his career and knew the novel intimately. In an interview seven years before being cast as Sydney Carton, Colman reflected on Dickens&#x27; forte for characterization, stating that Carton &#x27;has lived for me since the first instant I discovered him in the pages of the novel.&#x27; &quot;

In the book, Carton and Darnay are supposed to be as alike as twins. According to TCM, Selznick wanted Colman to play both roles, but Colman refused because of his experience with &quot;The Masquerader (1933)&quot;. Selznick later commented, &quot;I am glad now that he held out for that, because I think a great deal of the illusion of the picture might have been lost had Colman rescued Colman and had Colman gone to the guillotine so that Colman could go away with Lucie.&quot; In 1937, Colman did play a dual role for Selznick in &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.

Judith Anderson, May Robson, Emily Fitzroy and Lucille LaVerne all tested for Madame De Farge. LaVerne&#x27;s portrayal in another role, as &quot;The Vengeance&quot;, inspired the character of the Evil Queen in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs:&quot; She provided the voices for both the Queen and the hag. Blanche Yurka, a noted Broadway actress at the time, made her film debut playing Madame De Farge.

==Reception==
Andre Sennwald wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of December 26, 1935: &quot;Having given us &#x27;David Copperfield&#x27;, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer now heaps up more Dickensian magic with a prodigally stirring production of &#x27;A Tale of Two Cities&#x27; ... For more than two hours it crowds the screen with beauty and excitement, sparing nothing in its recital of the Englishmen who were caught up in the blood and terror of the French Revolution ... The drama achieves a crisis of extraordinary effectiveness at the guillotine, leaving the audience quivering under its emotional sledge-hammer blows ... Ronald Colman gives his ablest performance in years as Sydney Carton and a score of excellent players are at their best in it ... Only Donald Woods&#x27;s Darnay is inferior, an unpleasant study in juvenile virtue. It struck me, too, that Blanche Yurka was guilty of tearing an emotion to tatters in the rôle of Madame De Farge ... you can be sure that &#x27;A Tale of Two Cities&#x27; will cause a vast rearranging of ten-best lists.&quot;

The Marquis St. Evrémonde character from this production was nominated for the 2003 American Film Institute list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains.

<text>Three Smart Girls is a 1936 American musical comedy film directed by Henry Koster and starring Barbara Read, Nan Grey, Deanna Durbin (her feature film debut), and Ray Milland. The film&#x27;s screenplay was written by Adele Comandini and Austin Parker, and is about three sisters who travel to New York City to prevent their father from remarrying. The three plot to bring their divorced parents back together again.

It began an eight-year span of successful Deanna Durbin musicals and spawned two sequels, &quot;Three Smart Girls Grow Up&quot; and &quot;Hers to Hold&quot;.

==Plot==
Three sisters living in Switzerland hear their father is going to marry a younger woman in New York. They travel there to stop it.

Their plan involves getting a man to seduce her father&#x27;s fiancée. They accidentally hire a genuinely rich man who falls for one of the sisters.

==Cast==
* Binnie Barnes as Donna Lyons
* Charles Winninger as Judson Craig
* Alice Brady as Mrs. Lyons
* Ray Milland as Lord Michael Stuart
* Mischa Auer as Count Arisztid
* Ernest Cossart as Binns
* Lucile Watson as Martha 
* John &#x27;Dusty&#x27; King as Bill Evans (as John King)
* Nella Walker as Dorothy Craig
* Hobart Cavanaugh as Wilbur Lamb
* Nan Grey as Joan 
* Barbara Read as Kay 
* Deanna Durbin as &#x27;Penny&#x27;

==Production==
The film was based on an original story. It was purchased for Universal by Adele Comandini. This film became a vehicle for 13 year old Jeanne Dante, who had been on Broadway in &quot;Call It a Day&quot;. The film was produced by Harry John Brown who had recently joined Universal from Warners.

Joe Pasternak wanted Judy Garland for Durbin&#x27;s role, but Garland&#x27;s home studio, MGM, wouldn&#x27;t loan her out for the picture. However, Joe would produce four Garland films when he moved to MGM. Durbin was picked up from MGM after a short film, &quot;Every Sunday&quot; co-starring Garland. MGM dropped Durbin&#x27;s contract freeing her to do &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot;.

In July 1936, Deanna Durbin appeared alongside Dante, with Henry Koster to direct. By August Dante had dropped out and the three girls were to be played by Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read. Binnie Barnes signed to play the vamp.

Ray Milland was a last-minute replacement for Louis Hayward, who was originally cast, but fell ill shortly of pleurisy four days into filming. The replacement was made in September.

==Reception==
The film was a huge box office hit. Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1937, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed review, complaining about the sentimentality of the first half of the film, and noting that it is only with the appearance of Precious, her mother, the Hungarian Count, and the English nobleman in the second half of the film that the picture is made. While criticizing Durbin&#x27;s &quot;consciously girlish&quot; performance, Greene praised the acting of Auer and claimed that the second half of the film was where &quot;some welcome humour of an adult kind creep[s] tardily&quot; into the film.

===Awards===
&quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Sound (Homer G. Tasker), and Best Original Story.

===Legacy===
The film not only made Deanna Durbin a star, but it led to a number of imitations.

<text>The Awful Truth is a 1937 American screwball comedy film directed by Leo McCarey, and starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant. Based on the 1922 play &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; by Arthur Richman, the film recounts a distrustful rich couple who begin divorce proceedings, only to interfere with one another&#x27;s romances.

This was McCarey&#x27;s first film for Columbia Pictures, with the dialogue and comic elements largely improvised by the director and actors. Irene Dunne&#x27;s costumes were designed by Robert Kalloch. Although Grant tried to leave the production due to McCarey&#x27;s directorial style, &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; saw his emergence as an A-list star and proponent of on-the-set improvisation.

The film was a box office success and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress (Dunne), and Best Supporting Actor (Ralph Bellamy), winning for Best Director (McCarey). &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was selected in 1996 for preservation in the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry, deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was the first of three films co-starring Grant and Dunne, followed by &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (1940) and &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; (1941).

==Plot==
Jerry Warriner tells his wife he is going on vacation to Florida, but instead spends the week at his sports club in New York City. He returns home to find that his wife, Lucy, spent the night in the company of her handsome music teacher, Armand Duvalle. Lucy claims his car broke down unexpectedly. Lucy discovers that Jerry did not actually go to Florida. Their mutual suspicion results in divorce proceedings, with Lucy winning custody of their dog. The judge orders the divorce finalized in 90 days.

Lucy moves into an apartment with her Aunt Patsy. Her neighbor is amiable but rustic Oklahoma oilman Dan Leeson, whose mother does not approve of Lucy. Jerry subtly ridicules Dan in front of Lucy, which causes Lucy to tie herself more closely to Dan. Jerry begins dating sweet-natured but simple singer Dixie Belle Lee, unaware that she performs an embarrassing, sexually suggestive act at a local nightclub.

Convinced that Lucy is still having an affair with Duvalle, Jerry bursts into Duvalle&#x27;s apartment only to discover that Lucy is a legitimate vocal student of Duvalle and is giving her first recital. Realizing he may still love Lucy, Jerry undermines Lucy&#x27;s character with Mrs. Leeson even as Dan and Lucy agree to marry. When Jerry attempts to reconcile with Lucy afterward, he discovers Duvalle hiding in Lucy&#x27;s apartment and they have a fistfight while Dan and his mother apologize for assuming the worst about Lucy. When Jerry chases Armand out the door, Dan breaks off his engagement to Lucy and he and his mother return to Oklahoma.

A few weeks later, Jerry begins dating high-profile heiress Barbara Vance. Realizing she still loves Jerry, Lucy crashes a party at the Vance mansion the night the divorce decree is to become final. Pretending to be Jerry&#x27;s sister, she undermines Jerry&#x27;s character, implying that &quot;their&quot; father was working class rather than wealthy. Acting like a showgirl, she recreates Dixie&#x27;s risqué musical number. The snobbish Vances are appalled.

Jerry attempts to explain away Lucy&#x27;s behavior as drunkenness, and says he will drive Lucy home. Lucy repeatedly sabotages the car on the ride to delay their parting. Pulled over by motorcycle police officers, who believe Jerry is drunk, Lucy manages to wreck the car. The police give the couple a lift to Aunt Patsy&#x27;s nearby cabin. Although sleeping in different (but adjoining) bedrooms, Jerry and Lucy slowly overcome their pride and a series of comic mishaps in order to admit &quot;the awful truth&quot; that they still love one another. They reconcile at midnight, just before their divorce is to be finalized.

==Cast==
The cast includes:
==Pre-production==

The film is based on the stage play &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; by playwright Arthur Richman. In that play, created on September 18, 1922, at the Henry Miller&#x27;s Theater of Broadway (current Stephen Sondheim Theatre), Norman Satterly divorces his wife, Lucy Warriner Satterly, after they accuse one another of infidelity. Lucy is about to remarry, but needs to clear her name before her fiancé will agree to go forward with the marriage. As she tries to salvage her reputation, she falls in love again with her ex-husband and they remarry.

There were two previous film versions, a 1925 silent film &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; from Producers Distributing Corporation starring Warner Baxter and Agnes Ayres and a 1929 sound version from Pathé Exchange, &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, starring Ina Claire and Henry Daniell. Producer D.A. Doran had purchased the rights to the play for Pathé. When Pathé closed, he joined Columbia Pictures. Columbia subsequently purchased all of Pathé&#x27;s scripts and screenplay rights for $35,000 ($ in dollars). Doran chose to remake the film in 1937, just as Columbia head Harry Cohn was hiring director Leo McCarey to direct comedies for the studio.

Cohn offered the film to director Tay Garnett. Garnett read Dwight Taylor&#x27;s script, and felt it was &quot;about as funny as the seven-year-itch in an iron lung.&quot; He turned it down. According to Garnett, McCarey accepted the project simply because he needed work. &quot;Sure, the script was terrible, but I&#x27;ve seen worse. I worked it over for a few weeks, changed this and that. I finally decided I could make something of it.&quot;

McCarey did not like the narrative structure of the play, the previous film versions, or the unproduced Pathé script. Cohn had already assigned Everett Riskin to produce the film, and screenwriter Dwight Taylor had a draft script. Taylor changed Norman Satterly to Jerry Warriner, got rid of much of the play&#x27;s moralistic tone, and added a good deal of screwball comedy. Jerry is violence-prone (he punches Lucy in the eye), and the couple fight over a necklace (not a dog). Much of the action in Taylor&#x27;s script is set at Jerry&#x27;s club. The mishaps in the script cause Jerry to crack up emotionally. When the couple visit their old home (which is being sold at auction), his love for his wife is rekindled.

McCarey didn&#x27;t like Taylor&#x27;s script. He believed, however, that &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; would do well at the box office. With the Great Depression in its seventh year, he felt audiences would enjoy seeing a picture about rich people having troubles. During face-to-face negotiations with Cohn, McCarey demanded $100,000 ($ in dollars) to direct. Cohn balked. McCarey wandered over to a piano and began to play show-tunes. Cohn, an avid fan of musicals, decided that anyone who liked that kind of music had to be talented—and he agreed to pay McCarey&#x27;s fee. He also agreed not to interfere in the production.

McCarey&#x27;s hiring was not announced until April 6, 1937. Riskin withdrew from the film as McCarey insisted on producing.

===Script===
McCarey worked with screenwriter Viña Delmar and her regular collaborator, her husband, Eugene. The couple had written racy novels as well as the source material and screenplay for McCarey&#x27;s &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot;. The Delmars refused to work anywhere but their home, visit the studio or the set, or to meet any of the actors when working on a script. In a letter to author Elizabeth Kendall, Viña Delmar said that McCarey worked with them on the script at their home, suggesting scenes. McCarey asked the Delmars to drop the major plot points of the play—which focused on Dan Leeson&#x27;s attempt to purchase mineral rights, a fire in Lucy Warriner&#x27;s apartment building, and Lucy&#x27;s midnight meeting with another man at a luxurious mountain resort—and focus on the pride which Jerry and Lucy feel and which keeps them from reconciling.

According to the Delmars, they completed a script which included musical numbers, making it resemble musical theatre more than screwball comedy. It also largely retained the play&#x27;s narrative structure, with four acts: the break-up at the Warriner house, events at Jerry Warriner&#x27;s sports club, arguments and misunderstandings at Lucy Warriner&#x27;s apartment, and a finale at Dan Leeson&#x27;s apartment. The sets were simple, and few actors were needed.

According to other accounts, Mary C. McCall Jr., Dwight Taylor (again), and Dorothy Parker all worked on the script as well. None of their work was used by McCarey, and Taylor even asked that his name be taken off the script. Ralph Bellamy says that McCarey himself then wrote a script, completely reworking Delmar&#x27;s effort. Harry Cohn was not happy with McCarey&#x27;s decision to abandon Delmar&#x27;s work, but McCarey convinced the studio boss that he could rework it. Film historians Iwan W. Morgan and Philip Davies say that McCarey retained only a single aspect of Delmar&#x27;s work: The alleged infidelity of both man and wife.

===Casting===
Irene Dunne had freelanced and had not been under contract to a studio since her arrival in Hollywood. She appeared in &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot; (1936) for Columbia, and despite her misgivings about doing comedy her performance had garnered her an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. Dunne wanted to undertake a new project quickly after negative reaction to her performing in blackface in &quot;Show Boat&quot; (also 1936). Her agent, Charles K. Feldman, helped develop &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; for Dunne, and the film was rushed into production to accommodate her. McCarey wanted her for the film because he thought the &quot;incongruity&quot; of a &quot;genteel&quot; actress like Dunne in screwball comedy was funny, and she was asked to appear in it even though Delmar was still working on a script. Dunne was attached to the picture in mid-February 1937, although commitments to other stage and film projects meant production could not begin for several months. Dunne was paid $75,000 ($ in dollars) for her work. Dunne later said her decision to work on the film was &quot;just an accident&quot;.

Cary Grant was cast three days after Dunne. Grant had also recently become a freelance actor without long-standing contractual obligations to any studio. By late 1936, he was negotiating a contract with Columbia. He ran into McCarey on the street, and told McCarey he was free. In February 1937, he signed a non-exclusive contract with Columbia Pictures in which he agreed to make four films over two years, provided each film was a prestige picture. He was paid $50,000 ($ in dollars) to appear in &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;. Grant was eager to work with McCarey, McCarey wanted Grant, and Cohn assigned Grant to the picture.

For Ralph Bellamy, a contract player with Columbia, the film was just another assignment. Delmar&#x27;s draft script, sent to Bellamy by his agent, originally described Dan Leeson as a conservative, prudish Englishman, a role written with Roland Young in mind. Per his agent&#x27;s request, Bellamy ignored the script. Some time later, Bellamy got a call from his good friend, the writer Mary McCall, who asked him to work with her on redeveloping the role. McCall had been instructed to change the Leeson character into someone from the American West. They spent an afternoon together, and recrafting the character as well as writing a scene for his entrance in the film. After more time passed, Bellamy ran into writer Dwight Taylor at a cocktail party and learned that Taylor was rewriting his part. After a few weeks more, Dorothy Parker called Bellamy to tell him she was now working on the script and changing his role once more. The second week of June 1937, Bellamy&#x27;s agent told him he&#x27;d been cast in &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; and was to report to the studio the next Monday. His casting was announced on June 23.

Joyce Compton was cast on June 9, and Alexander D&#x27;Arcy was cast some time before July 11.

For the animal role of Mr. Smith, two dogs were cast but did not work out. Skippy, better known to the public as &quot;Asta&quot; in the &quot;Thin Man&quot; film series, was cast at the end of June. Skippy proved difficult to work with. For a critical scene in which Mr. Smith is to leap into Jerry Warriner&#x27;s arms, a white rubber mouse (one of the dog&#x27;s favorite toys) was placed in Cary Grant&#x27;s breast pocket. But whenever Grant held his arms open, Skippy would dodge him at the last moment. It took several days to get the shot. The human cast of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was also forced to take several unscheduled days of vacation in late July 1937 because Skippy was booked on another film.

===Pre-production activity===
&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was budgeted at $600,000 ($ in dollars). Pre-production on the film neared completion at the beginning of May 1937. Stephen Goosson was the supervising art director (his role today would be called production designer), and Lionel Banks the unit art director. Goosson was a 20-year veteran art director for Columbia Pictures, and &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; is considered among his most important films of the 1930s. Lionel Banks was primarily responsible for the production design of the film. He specialized in films set in the present day, and created restrained, well-crafted Art Deco sets for the picture. &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; is considered one of his more elegant designs.

===Costumes===
Columbia Pictures&#x27; chief costume and fashion designer, Robert Kalloch, created Dunne&#x27;s wardrobe. His work was personally approved by studio head Harry Cohn. The clothes were the most elegant and expensive yet worn by her on film, and costume design historian Jay Jorgensen has described them as &quot;magnificent&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; ranked &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; as one of the 25 most fashionable films ever made in Hollywood.

==Principal photography==
Principal photography began on June 21, 1937, without a completed script. This so concerned Ralph Bellamy that the Friday before filming started he contacted Harry Cohn to ask where the script was. Cohn declined to say anything about the film, and allowed Bellamy to talk to Leo McCarey. Bellamy went to McCarey&#x27;s home to discuss the issue with him. McCarey was charming and witty, but evaded all of Bellamy&#x27;s questions and concerns.

===Initial disruptiveness of McCarey&#x27;s working style===
The first four or five days on the set were deeply upsetting to Dunne, Grant, and Bellamy due to the lack of a script and McCarey&#x27;s working methods. McCarey had the cast sit around on the set the first few days and largely swap stories. The lack of rehearsal activity and script caused Dunne such emotional distress that she spontaneously burst into tears several times each day. Grant was so nervous that at times he became physically ill. When McCarey bowed to the cast&#x27;s concerns and blocked a scene for Dunne and Grant, Grant refused to perform it.

Cary Grant in particular was unnerved by McCarey&#x27;s behavior and lack of a script. Grant had spent most of his career at Paramount Studios, which had a factory-like approach to motion picture production; actors were expected to learn their lines and be ready every morning, and shooting schedules were strictly enforced. McCarey&#x27;s improvisational style was deeply unsettling to Grant, and at the end of the first week Grant sent Cohn an eight-page memorandum titled &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With This Picture&quot;. Grant asked Cohn to let him out of the film, offering to do one or more pictures for free and even saying he&#x27;d reimburse Cohn $5,000 if he were released. McCarey was so angry at Grant that he stopped speaking to him and told Cohn he&#x27;d kick in another $5,000 to get Grant off the film. Cohn ignored both the memo and the offers. Grant also sought to switch roles with Bellamy and asked Cohn to pressure McCarey into sticking to a more conventional style of filmmaking. Again, Cohn said no to Grant&#x27;s requests. McCarey later said that Grant &quot;had no sound judgment&quot; when it came to determining what made for good comedy, and McCarey seemed to harbor a grudge against Grant for decades for trying to get out of the picture.

===Cast support for improvisation===
According to Bellamy, after the first five days, the three leads began to believe McCarey was a comedy genius.

McCarey believed that improvisation was the key to great comedy. &quot;[A] lot of times we&#x27;d go into a scene [on &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;] with nothing at all&quot;, he said. His working method was to ask his cast to improvise the scene, creating their own dialogue and blocking their own action before allowing cameras to roll. If a problem arose with a scene, McCarey would sit at a piano on the set and pick out tunes and sing until a solution came to him. McCarey supported his actors&#x27; comedy and other choices, which quickly alleviated the tension which had built up on the set. For example, Ralph Bellamy was told to bring a selection of clothing from his own extensive, personal wardrobe. He did so, but was worried that he had not been given costuming. McCarey told him that the clothes he&#x27;d brought from home fit the part perfectly, which made Bellamy feel comfortable in his acting and comedy choices. McCarey was also extremely patient with his cast, understanding of their concerns, and sympathetic to their needs and problems. He also used his own wit to keep his cast in good humor. Irene Dunne later recalled that the entire cast loved working on the picture because every day was full of laughter. Many actors didn&#x27;t want each day&#x27;s work to end, because they were having such a good time.

Cary Grant began trusting the director once he realized that McCarey recognized Grant&#x27;s strengths and welcomed Grant&#x27;s ideas about blocking, dialogue, and comic bits. McCarey also had the ability to get his performers to mimic his own unique mannerisms. (It was something Irene Dunne thoroughly admired.) McCarey taught Grant a repertoire of comic vocalizations (like grunts) and movements and asked him to work with them. In turn, Grant imitated much of McCarey&#x27;s own mannerisms and personality, becoming a &quot;clone&quot; of McCarey. Grant biographer Graham McCann says it would be an &quot;overstatement&quot; to say that McCarey gave Grant an on-screen personality. Grant had been working on this acting persona for some time; McCarey merely made Grant think more precisely about what he was trying to accomplish on camera. Additionally, McCarey worked to give Grant comic dialogue and physical comedy (like pratfalls) as well as sophisticated dialogue and urbane moments, efforts which Grant also deeply appreciated. Over time, Grant came to feel liberated rather than inhibited by the lack of a script, and seized the chance to make sure that the film&#x27;s humor reflected his own. According to Ralph Bellamy, Grant enjoyed knowing that the audience was laughing at him, and worked to encourage it. Grant also used his early feelings of frustration to build his character&#x27;s emotional and sexual frustration in the film.

Most of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was improvised on the set. McCarey had two guides for directing the film. The first was that he believed the film was the &quot;story of my life&quot;, because McCarey based many scenes and comic moments on misunderstandings he had had with his own wife (although they never accused one another of infidelity). The second guide was McCarey&#x27;s own lengthy experience directing comedy. Jerry Warriner&#x27;s need to find a lie to cover for his &quot;boys&#x27; night out away from the wives&quot; is a typical scenario McCarey used in many feature motion pictures and short films. It was also common in many of the Laurel and Hardy shorts which McCarey directed for only the man&#x27;s alibi to break down. Subsequently, in &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, it is Jerry&#x27;s alibi that crumbles. The bowler hat sequence in Lucy&#x27;s apartment was based on a standard bit McCarey had frequently used in Laurel and Hardy films (as well as in the Marx Brothers&#x27; comedy &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (1933), which McCarey had also directed). Dunne&#x27;s increasingly outrageous mishaps with the car radio in the scene after Jerry and Lucy leave the Vance mansion is similar to Harpo Marx&#x27;s misadventures with a radio in &quot;Duck Soup&quot; and incorporates the straight man (Grant for Oliver Hardy) from Laurel and Hardy bits.

McCarey also relied on his ability to craft a narrative from a series of unrelated sketches, and he often staged portions of his films like musicals, inserting a song to tie elements together.

===Improvising the film===
Irene Dunne had never met Cary Grant before, but she later recalled that they &quot;just worked from the first moment&quot; and called Grant a very generous actor. Cary Grant, in turn, said &quot;we just clicked&quot;. Dunne so trusted his comedy judgment that she would often turn to him after a take and ask in a whisper, &quot;Funny?&quot;

Nearly every day during principal photography, Leo McCarey would arrive in the morning with ideas for the film written down on scraps of paper. On days when he had nothing in mind, McCarey would arrive on the set and play the piano until inspiration struck. He would then have the script girl write down his ideas or dialogue, and give the actors their instructions. Although he asked the cast to rehearse scenes, McCarey also encouraged his actors to improvise and build up the scene on their own. At times, McCarey himself acted out bits with the performers. McCarey continued to meet with screenwriter Viña Delmar every evening, sitting with her in a parked car on Hollywood Boulevard and improvising scenes for her to write down. McCarey also relied for dialogue on writer Sidney Buchman, who had joined Columbia in 1934 and who had written &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot; for Irene Dunne. Some of the best lines and comic moments in the film remained improvised, however. For example, McCarey himself came up with the idea of arguing over a dog rather than property. Another example occurs when Cary Grant appears at Lucy&#x27;s apartment while she is meeting for the first time with Dan Leeson. The writers did not have a line of dialogue for Grant, who ad-libbed the line, &quot;The judge says this is my day to see the dog.&quot; Grant and Dunne also came up with the idea for Jerry to tickle Lucy with a pencil while Dan Leeson is at Lucy&#x27;s door. Grant quickly became an accomplished improvisational actor during the shoot. He ad-libbed with such speed and composure that his co-stars often &quot;broke character&quot;.

The nightclub scene was apparently also somewhat improvised on the set. In the Delmar script, Jerry&#x27;s date is named Toots Biswanger and the scene is meant to parody the novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (two years before the film). She has a Southern American English accent, and Toots believes her song is a tribute to the novel. Jerry has a line in which he slyly criticizes Lucy&#x27;s date by telling Dan &quot;It&#x27;s a book.&quot; As Toots sings the song&#x27;s critical line (&quot;my dreams are gone with the wind&quot;), the wind machine on the stage was to have blown off her hat, then her muff, then her cape. On the set, the singer&#x27;s name is changed to Dixie Belle, much of the dialogue is improvised, and the wind machine joke changed to a more restrained blowing of the dress.

According to Dunne, the action and dialogue for the scene in the Vance mansion was all written on the set. Dunne choreographed the dance and at least one line of dialogue, while the bit with the long handkerchief was a classic comic routine from silent films.

Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn was not happy with McCarey&#x27;s directorial methods, either. On the first day of shooting, he walked onto the soundstage to see Bellamy singing &quot;Home on the Range&quot; off-key while Dunne tried to pick out the tune on a piano. He shook his head in disbelief and left. Later, Cohn became angry when he learned McCarey was apparently dawdling on the set by playing the piano and telling stories. He angrily confronted McCarey in front of the cast and crew, shouting, &quot;I hired you to make a great comedy so I could show up Frank Capra. The only one who&#x27;s going to laugh at this picture is Capra!&quot; When Cohn caught McCarey playing the piano another time, McCarey dismissed his concerns by claiming to be writing a song for the film. Cohn also came on the set the day Harold Lloyd was visiting. Cohn was so incensed that McCarey seemed to be telling jokes that he ordered the set cleared. Lloyd departed, and so did McCarey. Cohn finally reached McCarey at home, and in a profanity-laced conversation demanded that McCarey return to work. McCarey demanded in turn that Cohn apologize personally to everyone on the set, and send his apology to Lloyd. Cohn, unwilling to abandon the picture, perfunctorily apologized. Nevertheless, Cohn did not rein in the director. Cohn decided instead to write the entire picture off as a loss, since he was obligated to pay Dunne&#x27;s salary whether the film was made or not and he could not fire McCarey since only McCarey knew where the film was headed.

Improvisation proved to be a problem for actor Alexander D&#x27;Arcy, who played the suave musician Armand Duvalle. Initially, D&#x27;Arcy portrayed Duvalle as French. Columbia Pictures&#x27; in-house censors vetoed his performance, saying it would offend overseas audiences. D&#x27;Arcy tried an Austrian, Italian, Spanish, and even vaguely South American persona. Each time, the censors disapproved of his work. Finally, after much experimentation, the actor&#x27;s makeup was changed to fair from swarthy, he was told not to gesticulate too much, and he created a nondescript, vaguely European accent (which was nicknamed &quot;Spenchard&quot;) for his role. The accent proved difficult to maintain. During long takes, D&#x27;Arcy would slip into his native French-inflected voice, forcing these scenes to be reshot multiple times.

Improvisation could sometimes be a risky choice for the production in other ways as well. Delmar&#x27;s script called for the film to be set in Connecticut. The critical plot element had the divorce court judge issue a 90-day interlocutory decree, and it is during this period in which most of the action in the film occurs. As filming commenced, it became clear that no one knew if Connecticut permitted interlocutory decrees. It turned out that the state did not, and Columbia Pictures&#x27; in-house lawyers could not determine which state did. By coincidence, David T. Wilentz, the New Jersey Attorney General, was visiting Los Angeles. McCarey called him on the telephone, and Wilentz confirmed that New Jersey divorce courts used them. The setting of the film was then changed to New Jersey. Improvisation also led to minor visual inconsistencies in the film, such as when Jerry Warriner appears to both stand and sit during the divorce proceedings.

===Songs and choreography===
During pre-production, McCarey knew that he needed two songs for important scenes in the picture. Composer Ben Oakland and lyricist Milton Drake wrote two numbers for the film, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Music&quot; and &quot;My Dreams Are Gone with the Wind&quot;. Both were finished by the time principal photography began. Compton&#x27;s original delivery of &quot;My Dreams Are Gone with the Wind&quot; and Dunne&#x27;s reprise of it were filmed by July 25.

One critical scene in &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; occurs in a nightclub, during which both Dunne and Grant dance. In a second scene, Dunne&#x27;s character dances in front of Jerry, his fiancée, and her family. Usually, the production would hire a choreographer for these scenes, but McCarey declined to do so. Instead, he asked an African American youth working on the Columbia lot to teach Dunne and Grant how to dance. Their inept efforts to imitate him made their on-screen dances funnier. Ralph Bellamy was required to do the fictional &quot;Balboa Stomp&quot; in the nightclub scene while Irene Dunne feebly tries to imitate him. The dance proved so physically intimidating that Bellamy lost and his muscles and joints were sore for weeks afterward. Irene Dunne choreographed the burlesque dance which her character performs at the Vance mansion to embarrass Jerry. In rehearsal, Leo McCarey asked her to insert a &quot;stripper bump&quot; into her routine. Dunne replied, &quot;Never could do that.&quot; McCarey laughed so hard at her response that he asked her to include it in the performance.

One of the film&#x27;s best remembered comedy moments is when Lucy Warriner accompanies an out of tune Dan Leeson on the piano while he sings &quot;Home on the Range&quot;. This was filmed on June 21, the first day of filming. McCarey wanted the song in the film, but knew neither performer would agree if requested. Instead, McCarey tricked them into it by casually asking Dunne if she could play the piano. She said she could, a little. McCarey then asked Bellamy if he could sing. The actor said he knew the words to the song, but could not sing. McCarey asked them to do the song anyway, telling Bellamy to &quot;belt it out&quot; in an Oklahoman accent. McCarey had their performance filmed, and it turned out so well that he ordered the footage printed. Dunne was furious when she realized McCarey had intended to use the footage in the film all along.

===Cinematography and editing===
Cinematographer Joseph Walker used mainly long takes when shooting &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;. With McCarey providing only minimal direction, this helped to make scenes feel spontaneous and energetic. Generally, a scene would only be shot once unless there was a mistake, and shooting days were kept short (often ending at 3 PM). One particular scene, however, took nearly a full day to film. During the film&#x27;s finale, shot about August 10, Delmar&#x27;s script called for a cat to block the door connecting Jerry and Lucy&#x27;s bedrooms, impeding Jerry&#x27;s attempt at a marital reconciliation. An animal wrangler brought five cats in the morning, but none would stand still. Frustrated, McCarey called another animal wrangler, who soon arrived with three more cats. None would stay still. Three more animal wranglers were called during the day, but none of the cats would perform as required. Finally, McCarey was forced to issue an open call to the public for anyone with a cat who would perform the actions required. When a cat was found that would stay still, the animal refused to move when Cary Grant attempted to open the door.

&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was shot primarily on a soundstage at Columbia Pictures&#x27; Gower Street studios. Principal photography ended on August 17, 1937, the 37th day of shooting. At end of August, location shooting occurred at Columbia Ranch, the studio&#x27;s lot located at the corner of Hollywood Way and Oak Street in Burbank, California. Reshoots on the film occurred during the first week of October.

McCarey did not permit Joseph Walker to shoot much coverage, preferring to &quot;edit in the camera&quot;. This left editor Al Clark with few choices once the film began to be pieced together. One major cut made to the film was actor Claud Allister performance as Lord Fabian in the Vance drawing room scene, which was completely excised. Film historian James Harvey says that the comic timing of Clark&#x27;s editing in the nightclub scene—cutting from Dixie Belle Lee&#x27;s performance to Jerry, Lucy, and Dan at the table—is &quot;exquisite...unmatched deadpan brilliance&quot;.

===Previews and release===
&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was shot in just six weeks, a record for a film of this genre (according to Ralph Bellamy). It was finished ahead of schedule and $200,000 ($ in dollars) under budget. The film contained several risqué moments which normally would have run afoul of the Motion Picture Production Code, including Jerry making double entendres about coal mines to an oblivious Dan, Dixie Belle Lee&#x27;s exposed underwear, Lucy &quot;goosing&quot; pompous Mrs. Vance, and the final moment of the film when the cuckoo clock figures go into the same room together. Code administrator Joseph Breen permitted these gags because the picture and its cast were high-quality, which served to undercut the raciness of the moments.

The film was test screened, and the audience&#x27;s reaction was good but not outstanding. Audiences were unused to seeing the three stars in a comedy, and were unsure whether they should laugh. McCarey realized the opening was too somber, and that viewers were not certain the picture was a comedy. He rewrote the opening scenes, adding one in which Lucy calls her attorney to discuss her impending divorce. A new bit in this scene helped establish the tone of the film more clearly. While on the phone, Lucy&#x27;s lawyer tries to tell her that &quot;Marriage is a beautiful thing&quot;. Each time, his wife (standing in the background of the shot) yells impatiently at him to remind him that dinner is ready. This happens three times. The attorney&#x27;s response is harsher the second time. The third time, he shouts back &quot;Shut your big mouth!&quot; At a second preview, audiences roared with laughter.

&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was released in theaters in the United States on October 21, 1937.

==Box office and reception==
Gross box office receipts for &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; were more than $3 million ($ in dollars). The film made a profit of $500,000 ($ in dollars) in a year when Columbia Pictures&#x27; studio-wide profit margin was just $1.3 million ($ in dollars).

&quot;The Film Daily&quot; named &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; as one of the ten best films of 1937.

Although he was not nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, the film was a triumph for Cary Grant. Overnight he was transformed into an A-list leading man. &quot;The Cary Grant Persona&quot; was fully established by this film, and Grant not only became an able improviser but often demanded improvisation in his films thereafter. Ralph Bellamy, however, was typecast for years in &quot;amiable dope&quot; roles after &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
The film was nominated for six Academy Awards (only winning Best Director for Leo McCarey).

After winning the Oscar, McCarey said he had won it for the wrong picture, since he considered his direction of the 1937 melodrama &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot; to be superior.

&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was selected in 1996 for preservation in the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film has since been recognized twice by American Film Institute:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – 68
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – No. 77

==Subsequent versions==
Dunne, Grant, and Bellamy performed scenes from &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; on the &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot; radio program on CBS on October 15, 1937.

&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was presented as a one-hour radio program on three occasions on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;. On the September 11, 1939 broadcast Grant and Claudette Colbert starred in the adaptation. Bob Hope and Constance Bennett played the leads for the March 10, 1941 version. Dunne and Grant reprised their original lead roles on the January 18, 1955, broadcast.

Dunne reprised her Lucy Warriner role in a 30-minute version of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; on &quot;The Goodyear Program&quot; on CBS on February 6, 1944. Walter Pidgeon played the role of Jerry Warriner.

The play inspired a film musical, &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (1953), starring Jane Wyman and Ray Milland.

<doc id="61525" wikidata="Q676341" url="?curid=61525" title="Dead End (1937 film)">
<text>Dead End is a 1937 American crime drama film directed by William Wyler. It is an adaptation of the Sidney Kingsley 1935 Broadway play of the same name. It stars Sylvia Sidney, Joel McCrea, Humphrey Bogart, Wendy Barrie, and Claire Trevor. It was the first film appearance of the acting group known as the Dead End Kids.

==Plot==
In the slums of New York City, on the East River just below the Queensboro Bridge, wealthy people live in opulent and luxurious apartments because of the picturesque views of the river, while the destitute and poor live nearby in crowded, cockroach-infested tenements.

At the end of the street is a dock on the East River; to the left are the luxury apartments, and to the right are the slums. The Dead End Kids, led by Tommy Gordon, are a gang of street urchins who are already well on the path to a life of petty crime. Members of the gang besides Tommy include Dippy, Angel, Spit, T.B., and Milty, the new kid on the block in search of friends. Spit is a bit malicious with a cruel streak, and initially bullies the newcomer and takes his pocket change. However, Tommy eventually lets Milty join the gang, and he turns out to be both a loyal and generous friend.

Tommy&#x27;s sister, Drina, dreams of marrying some dashing, rich stranger, who will save Tommy and her from this miserable life of poverty, and help prevent Tommy from growing up to be a mobster like Hugh &quot;Baby Face&quot; Martin, who has returned to the neighborhood to visit his mother and childhood girlfriend. Dave Connell, raised on the same street as Martin, recognizes him and warns him to stay away, but Martin contemptuously ignores him. Dave, a frustrated architect who currently works odd jobs, is Drina&#x27;s childhood friend. He is having an affair with a rich man&#x27;s mistress, Kay Burton. Although Dave and Kay love each other, they know they cannot be together because Dave cannot provide Kay with the kind of lifestyle she desires.

Meanwhile, the kids lure Philip, a rich kid from the apartments, into a cellar, where they beat and rob him. When the boy&#x27;s father tries to intervene, Tommy winds up stabbing him in the arm. He escapes the police and goes into hiding.

Martin is subsequently rejected by his mother, who denounces him as a murderer, and repulsed by his ex-girlfriend, Francey, who says she is tired and &quot;sick&quot;. He realizes she is now a prostitute and dismisses her with a few twenties pulled from a wad of cash. Despondent over the failed visit, he decides to kidnap the rich child for ransom to make the trip back worthwhile. Dave sees Martin and his accomplices planning the kidnapping, and again warns him to leave. Martin knifes him, and Hunk pushes him into the river. Managing to pull himself out of the river, Dave pursues the hoodlums, knocking out Hunk and chasing Martin on the rooftops before cornering him on a fire escape. Amid a hail of bullets, he manages to mortally wound Martin, who falls onto the street below. While on the ground, Martin engages oncoming police officers in a firefight, shooting a couple before they open fire and kill him.

As the police and a crowd of people gather around Martin&#x27;s body, the doorman recognizes Spit as being a member of the gang that attacked the rich kid&#x27;s father, and identifies him to Officer Mulligan. Spit exonerates himself by informing the police that the man was cut by Tommy, who has returned to say goodbye to Drina before running away.

Meanwhile, Kay approaches Dave, asking him to go away with her, using the reward money that he is owed for killing Martin. Dave refuses, and Kay returns to the man whom she does not love, but can provide her with financial security.

Tommy hears of Spit&#x27;s betrayal, and tries to give him the mark of the &quot;squealer&quot;, which is a knife wound across the cheek. Before he can do so, Dave intervenes, and Drina and he convince Tommy to surrender to the police. Dave then offers to use his reward money to pay for Tommy&#x27;s defense. As Drina, Dave, and Tommy leave with Mulligan, the rest of the Dead End Kids meander off into the night, singing &quot;If I had the wings of an angel, over these prison walls I would fly&quot;.

==Production==
Goldwyn wanted George Raft to play the gangster, but he turned it down, saying the part was too unsympathetic. &quot;Dead End&quot; was filmed from May 4 through mid-July 1937 on a single enormous set.

Robert Osborne, film historian, stated that Joel McCrea had a tough time working with Humphrey Bogart, especially during the scene &quot;on the rooftop, guns ready, and standing very close to each other. During the filming of that scene, McCrea kept flinching, and the director William Wyler had to keep doing more takes. Finally, Wyler pulled McCrea aside, and he asked him what was wrong. McCrea, embarrassed to tell him, explained that Bogart kept spitting in his face when he was speaking, not exactly what Wyler was expecting to hear or to be the problem. Happens with actors more than you can imagine.&quot;

==Counterparts in actuality==
The stage directions to the play indicate that Rockefeller Center can be seen in the distance, which would place the location of the pier around 50th Street in Manhattan. In the movie, the location is made more definite as 53rd Street, adjoining a luxury building that is obviously the River House, which was and is at that location.

The actual Dead End was the corner of East 53rd Street and the East River. Sutton Place South runs north from East 53rd Street at that corner. The producers of the play and movie made a painstaking effort to recreate that very area in the stage scenery. The River House at the end of East 53rd Street closely resembles the Griswalds&#x27; house in the play and movie. One can find traces of some of the locales in Dead End in that area, however, the pier and tenements are gone and the Dead End is now part of Sutton Place Park and Exit 11 of FDR Drive.

The official name of the &quot;Dead End&quot; Kids is on the brick wall in chalk behind the boys as they play cards. This wall and the inscription are shown in several scenes throughout the film. The graffiti reads: E 54th Place Gang Member Only.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Carter B. Horsley said of the River House: &quot;Erected in 1931 when its area still teemed with tenements, it was mocked in the famous and popular 1936 movie, &quot;Dead End&quot; that was Lillian Hellman&#x27;s adaptation of Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s play.&quot;

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;Night and Day&quot; in 1937, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, characterizing it as &quot;one of the best pictures of the year&quot;. While voicing mild complaints that the film &quot;gives too melodramatic a tone&quot;, Greene lavished praise on the &quot;fine flexible direction&quot; and the acting of Humphrey Bogart for which Greene called &quot;the finest performance Bogart has ever given&quot;.

===Awards and honors===
&quot;Dead End&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Art Direction (Richard Day), Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Gregg Toland) and Best Supporting Actress (Claire Trevor).

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list.

==Legacy==
The group of young actors from New York City who appeared in Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Dead End&quot; in 1935 had been brought to Hollywood by producer Samuel Goldwyn to appear in this film version. They proved to be so popular as the &quot;&quot;Dead End&quot; Kids&quot; that they continued to make more than 60 movies under various monikers, including the Little Tough Guys, the East Side Kids, and the Bowery Boys, for 20 years until 1958.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and Beta in 1985 by Embassy Home Entertainment and on DVD on March 8, 2005 by MGM.

<doc id="61527" wikidata="Q1619866" url="?curid=61527" title="In Old Chicago">
<text>In Old Chicago is a 1938 American disaster musical drama film directed by Henry King. The screenplay by Sonya Levien and Lamar Trotti was based on the Niven Busch story, &quot;We the O&#x27;Learys&quot;. The film is a fictionalized account about the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 and stars Alice Brady as Mrs. O&#x27;Leary, the owner of the cow which started the fire, and Tyrone Power and Don Ameche as her sons. It also stars Alice Faye and Andy Devine. At the time of its release, it was one of the most expensive movies ever made.

==Plot==
The O&#x27;Leary family are traveling to Chicago to start a new life when Patrick O&#x27;Leary tries to race a steam train in his wagon. He is killed when his wagon hits a bump and his horses break loose, dragging him. His wife Molly and their three boys are left to survive on their own. In town she agrees to prove her skills as a laundress when a woman&#x27;s dress is accidentally spattered with mud. She quickly proves herself and builds a laundry business in an area known as &quot;the Patch&quot;. Her sons are educated. One, Jack, becomes a reforming lawyer, but another, Dion, is involved in gambling. While washing a sheet, Mrs. O&#x27;Leary discovers a drawing, apparently created by Gil Warren, a devious local businessman. Her sons realize that it reveals that he has a plan to run a tramline along a street that he and his cronies intend to buy up cheaply.

Dion becomes enamored with a feisty saloon-bar singer, Belle, who works for Warren. After a stormy courtship they become lovers. Meanwhile, Bob, the youngest O&#x27;Leary son, who helps his mother, is in love with Gretchen, an innocent German girl. They meet in the barn watched by the O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s cow Daisy and plan to marry. Mrs. O&#x27;Leary approves of the match, but expresses disdain for the loose-living Belle.

Dion and Belle bribe the local politicians to set up a saloon on the street where the tramline will pass. Dion makes a deal to support Warren&#x27;s political career and carve up business in the town. However, Dion&#x27;s dishonest practices lead to conflict with his brother Jack when one of Dion&#x27;s cronies is arrested for multiple voting. Dion later decides to support his brother rather than Warren in the election, convinced he can cut out Warren altogether and reign-in Jack&#x27;s reformist zeal. He is increasingly attracted by the daughter of the corrupt local senator, leading to conflicts with Belle. Bob and Gretchen marry and have a baby.

At a Warren election rally a fight breaks out, arranged by Dion. All Warren&#x27;s election workers are arrested. Jack is elected mayor. He soon announces a campaign against corruption, targeting his brother&#x27;s fiefdom in the Patch, which he intends to demolish. Belle and Dion separate when Jack asks her to support him. When he realizes Belle might testify against him, Dion asks her to marry him, making her testimony inadmissible. As mayor, Jack marries the couple, but knocks Dion out in a fist fight as soon he realizes he has been deceived.

Mrs. O&#x27;Leary is told about the fight while helping Daisy&#x27;s calf to suckle. In her distress, she leaves a lamp in the barn, and Daisy knocks it over. A fire breaks out. Soon the whole of the Patch is on fire. Dion, Warren and their cronies are convinced that Jack has set the fire. Warren&#x27;s men look for Jack, seeking revenge. Advised by Philip Sheridan, Jack plans to create a firebreak by dynamiting buildings to stop the fire reaching the gasworks, but Warren&#x27;s gang try to stop him. When Dion learns from Bob how the fire really started, he rushes to Jack&#x27;s aid. In the struggle, Jack and Dion fight off the gang and set off the dynamite, but Jack is shot by one of Warren&#x27;s thugs and then killed by a falling building. Warren attempts to flee but is trampled to death by stampeding cattle from the stockyards.

Dion and Bob help to save Gretchen and the baby, while Belle rescues Mrs O&#x27;Leary. They all manage to escape to the river. Belle and Dion are reconciled, and Mrs. O&#x27;Leary predicts that the city will be rebuilt and flourish after her son&#x27;s sacrifice for its future.

==Production==
During pre-production, MGM had announced that Jean Harlow, who was under contract to that studio, would be loaned to 20th Century Fox to star in the role Belle Fawcett. However, due to Harlow&#x27;s untimely death, the part went to Alice Faye. Faye&#x27;s popularity skyrocketed as a result of the picture, and she was reunited with Power and Ameche that same year for &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, which proved to be even more successful.

Some sources claim that MGM offered to loan both Harlow and Clark Gable to Fox for &quot;In Old Chicago&quot; if they reciprocated by loaning Shirley Temple to MGM for their upcoming production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. However, this is merely a rumor, as Harlow died in June 1937, several months before MGM had even purchased the rights to &quot;Oz&quot;. The railroad scenes were filmed on the Sierra Railroad in Tuolumne County, California.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Alice Brady won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She was the first person to win the Supporting Oscar after being nominated in the prior year. The film was also nominated in the categories of Music (Scoring), Sound Recording (E. H. Hansen), and Writing (Original Story), and won for Assistant Director (Robert D. Webb).

==Historical accuracy==
Despite crediting the Chicago Historical Society for assistance with historical research, much of the film is fictionalized. The area known as &quot;the Patch&quot; did exist as a predominantly Irish neighbourhood, and was associated with crime, as portrayed in the film. In the years before the film was made it had been supplanted by the Levee, an area renowned for its corrupt politicians, known as the Gray Wolves, whose deeds resemble those of the characters in the film.

The portrayal of the O&#x27;Leary family is largely fictitious down to the names of the characters. Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s name was Catherine, not Molly. The O&#x27;Learys had two children, one son and one daughter. In the movie there are three sons. Her only son was named James Patrick O&#x27;Leary. The daughter was named Anna. Their father Patrick O&#x27;Leary did not die in 1854 as a result of an accident involving his horses. He died in 1894. Mrs. O&#x27;Leary did not run her own &quot;French Laundry&quot; out of their house.

The Mayor of Chicago in 1871 was Roswell B. Mason, not an O&#x27;Leary son. However, Mason was elected on a reform ticket like the fictional Jack and took similar measures to deal with the fire. Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s son James Patrick did achieve success as a gambler and saloon owner comparable to that of Dion in the film.

==Trivia==
Scotty Mattraw and Eddie Collins both worked as voice actors in Walt Disney&#x27;s first animated feature &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; the previous year, with Mattraw voicing Bashful and Collins voicing Dopey.

==Home media==
The film was released and restored to its full length on DVD in 2005.

<text>Lost Horizon is a 1933 novel by English writer James Hilton. The book was turned into a film, also called &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, in 1937 by director Frank Capra and a lavish musical remake in 1973 by producer Ross Hunter with music by Burt Bacharach. It is the origin of Shangri-La, a fictional utopian lamasery located high in the mountains of Tibet.

==Plot==
The prologue and epilogue are narrated by a neurologist. This neurologist and a novelist friend, Rutherford, are given dinner at Tempelhof, Berlin, by their old school-friend Wyland, a secretary at the British embassy. A chance remark by a passing airman brings up the topic of Hugh Conway, a British consul in Afghanistan, who disappeared under odd circumstances. Later in the evening, Rutherford reveals to the neurologist that, after the disappearance, he discovered Conway in a French mission hospital in Chung-Kiang (probably Chongqing), China, suffering from amnesia. Conway recovered his memory, told Rutherford his story (which Rutherford recorded in a manuscript), and then slipped away again.

Rutherford gives the neurologist his manuscript, which becomes the heart of the novel.

In May 1931, during the British Raj in India, the 80 White residents of Baskul are being evacuated to Peshawar due to revolution. In the aeroplane of the Maharajah of Chandrapore are: Conway, the British consul, aged 37; Charles Mallinson, his young vice-consul; an American, Henry D. Barnard; and a British missionary, Miss Roberta Brinklow. The plane is hijacked and flown instead over the mountains to Tibet. After a crash landing, the pilot dies, but not before telling the four (in Chinese, which only Conway speaks) to seek shelter at the nearby lamasery of Shangri-La. The location is unclear, but Conway believes the plane has &quot;progressed far beyond the western range of the Himalayas&quot; towards the lesser known heights of the Kuen-Lun mountain range.

The four are taken there by a party directed by Chang, a postulant at the lamasery who speaks English. The lamasery has modern conveniences, like central heating, bathtubs from Akron, Ohio, a large library, a grand piano, a harpsichord, and food from the fertile valley below. Towering above is Karakal, literally translated as &quot;Blue Moon,&quot; a mountain more than 28,000 feet high. Mallinson is keen to hire porters and leave, but Chang politely puts him off. The others eventually decide they are content to stay: Miss Brinklow because she wants to teach the people a sense of sin; Barnard because he is really Chalmers Bryant (wanted by the police for stock fraud) and because he is keen to develop the gold mines in the valley; and Conway because the contemplative scholarly life suits him.

A seemingly young Manchu woman, Lo-Tsen, is another postulant at the lamasery. She does not speak English, but plays the harpsichord. Mallinson falls in love with her, as does Conway, though more languidly. Conway is given an audience with the High Lama, an unheard-of honor. He learns that the lamasery was constructed in its present form by a Catholic monk named Perrault from Luxembourg, in the early eighteenth century. The lamasery has since then been joined by others who have found their way into the valley. Once they have done so, their aging slows; if they then leave the valley, they age quickly and die. Conway guesses correctly that the High Lama is Perrault, now 250 years old.

In a later audience, the High Lama reveals that he is finally dying, and that he wants Conway to lead the lamasery. The High Lama then dies. Conway contemplates the events.

Hours after the High Lama dies, Conway is outside still pondering the events while in the moonlight. Mallinson then grabs him by the arm and tells Conway he has arranged to leave the valley with porters and Lo-Tsen. Barnard and Brinklow have decided to stay. The porters and Lo-Tsen are waiting for him five kilometers outside the valley, but he cannot traverse the dangerous route alone, so he convinces Conway to go along and assist him. Conway is caught, divided between the two worlds. Ultimately, because of his love for the boy, he decides to join Mallinson. This ends Rutherford&#x27;s manuscript.

The last time Rutherford saw Conway, it appeared he was preparing to make his way back to Shangri-La. Rutherford completes his account by telling the neurologist that he attempted to track Conway and verify some of his claims of Shangri-La. He found the Chung-Kiang doctor who had treated Conway. The doctor said Conway had been brought in by a Chinese woman, who was ill and died soon after. She was old, the doctor had told Rutherford, &quot;Most old of anyone I have ever seen,&quot; implying that it was Lo-Tsen, aged drastically by her departure from Shangri-La. The narrator wonders whether Conway can find his way back to his lost paradise.

==Reception and legacy ==

The book, published in 1933, caught the notice of the public only after Hilton&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; was published in 1934. &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; became a huge popular success and in 1939 was published in paperback form, as Pocket Book #1, making it the first &quot;mass-market&quot; paperback.

By the 1960s, Pocket Books alone, over the course of more than 40 printings, had sold several million copies of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, helping to make it one of the most popular novels of the 20th Century.

United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt named the Presidential hideaway in Maryland, now called Camp David, after Shangri-La. In 1942, to ensure the safety of returning U.S. forces, Roosevelt answered a reporter&#x27;s question about the origin of the Doolittle Raid by saying it had been launched from &quot;Shangri-La&quot;. The true details of the raid were revealed to the public a year later. This inspired the naming of the USS &quot;Shangri-La&quot; (CV-38), commissioned in 1944.

&quot;Lost Horizon&quot;″s concept of Shangri-La has gone on to influence other quasi-Asian mystical locations in fiction including Marvel Comics&#x27; K&#x27;un L&#x27;un and DC Comics&#x27; Nanda Parbat.

<text>Lost Horizon (re-released in 1942 as The Lost Horizon of Shangri-La) is a 1937 American adventure drama fantasy film directed by Frank Capra. The screenplay by Robert Riskin is based on the 1933 novel of the same name by James Hilton.

The film exceeded its original budget by more than $776,000 and took five years to earn back its cost. The serious financial crisis it created for Columbia Pictures damaged the partnership between Capra and studio head Harry Cohn, as well as the friendship between Capra and Riskin.

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==
In 1935, a revolutionary uprising drives terrified Westerners to the airport in Baskul, China. The evacuation is organized by writer, soldier, and diplomat Robert Conway, before he is to return to the United Kingdom and become Foreign Secretary. He flies out with the last four evacuees, bound for Shanghai. Unbeknownst to the passengers — paleontologist Alexander Lovett; notorious swindler Henry Barnard; bitter, terminally ill Gloria Stone; and Conway&#x27;s younger brother George — their pilot has been forcibly replaced and their aircraft hijacked. It eventually runs out of fuel and crashes deep in the Himalayas, killing their abductor.

The group is rescued by Chang and his men and taken to Shangri-La, an idyllic valley sheltered from the bitter cold. The contented inhabitants are led by the mysterious High Lama. Initially anxious to return to civilization, most of the newcomers grow to love Shangri-La, including Gloria, who miraculously seems to be recovering from her illness. Conway is particularly enchanted, especially when he meets Sondra, a teacher who has grown up in Shangri-La. However, George and Maria, another young woman living there, are determined to leave.

Conway eventually has an audience with the High Lama and learns that he is a European Catholic priest, Father Perrault, who arrived in the area many years ago. The founder of Shangri-La is said to be two hundred years old, preserved, like the other residents, by the magical properties of the paradise he has created, but is finally dying and needs someone wise in the ways of the modern world to keep it safe. Having read Conway&#x27;s writings, Sondra believed he is the one; the Lama agreed with her and arranged for Conway&#x27;s abduction. The old man names Conway his successor and then peacefully passes away.

George refuses to believe the Lama&#x27;s fantastic story, and that Maria is much older than the 20 she claims to be. Chang says Maria was brought to Shangri-La in 1888 and was 20 at the time, which would make her 66 or 67. (Sondra claims to be 30.) Uncertain and torn between love and loyalty, Conway reluctantly agrees to accompany George and Maria with a group of porters returning to their homes. The porters gradually leave the trio behind, even shooting at them for their amusement. However, the shots trigger an avalanche that buries the natives.

After more grueling travel, Maria collapses in the snow. Conway picks her up and carries her to the shelter of a cave. There they see she has died, her withered face revealing her true age. George loses his sanity and jumps to his death. Conway continues on, finally collapsing. He is found and taken to a Chinese mission, where a search party sent from Britain meets him. The ordeal has caused him to lose his memory of Shangri-La.

On the long voyage back to the United Kingdom, he remembers everything; he tells his story and then jumps ship in Singapore. Searchers pursue him back to the Himalayas, but are unable to follow him any further. In the final scene, he reaches the pass leading to Shangri-La.

==Production==
Frank Capra had read the James Hilton novel while filming &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, and he intended to make &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; his next project. When Ronald Colman, his first and only choice for the role of Robert Conway, proved to be unavailable, Capra decided to wait and made &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; instead.

Harry Cohn authorized a budget of $1.25 million for the film, the largest amount ever allocated to a project up to that time. According to a 1986 &quot;Variety&quot; interview with Frank Capra Jr., his father had wanted to shoot the film in color, but because the only suitable stock footage he intended to incorporate into the film, such as scenes from a documentary about the Himalayas, was in black and white, he was forced to change his plans. In 1985, Capra Sr. said the decision to film in black and white was made because three-strip Technicolor was new and fairly expensive, and the studio was unwilling to increase the film&#x27;s budget so he could utilize it.

An often repeated story concerns casting the part of the High Lama. After a screen test of 56-year-old retired stage actor A. E. Anson, Capra decided that he was just right for the part. He made a call to the actor&#x27;s home, and the housekeeper who answered the phone was told to relay the message to Anson that the part was his. Not long after, the housekeeper called back telling Capra that when Anson heard the news, he had a heart attack and died. Subsequently, Capra offered the part to 58-year-old Henry B. Walthall. He died before shooting began. Finally, to play it safer age-wise, Capra cast Sam Jaffe, who was just 45. This is disputed, however, by camera logs dating back to the production that indicate Anson never tested for the part. Film historian Kendall Miller surmises that this story originated as an effort to add drama to Jaffe&#x27;s casting.
From the beginning, Capra ran into difficulties that resulted in serious cost overruns. Principal photography began on March 23, 1936, and by the time it was completed on July 17, the director had spent $1.6 million. Contributing to the added expenses was the filming of snow scenes and aircraft interiors at the Los Angeles Ice and Cold Storage Warehouse, where the low temperature affected the equipment and caused lengthy delays. The Streamline Moderne sets representing Shangri-La, designed by Stephen Goosson, had been constructed adjacent to Hollywood Way, a busy thoroughfare by day, which necessitated filming at night and heavily added to overtime expenses. Many exteriors were filmed on location in Palm Springs, Lucerne Valley, the Ojai Valley, the Mojave Desert, the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and in what is now Westlake Village, adding the cost of transporting cast, crew, and equipment to the swelling budget.

Capra also used multiple cameras to cover every scene from several angles, and by the time shooting ended, he had used 1.1 million feet of film. For one scene lasting four minutes, he shot 6,000 feet, the equivalent of one hour of screen time. He spent six days filming Sam Jaffe performing the High Lama&#x27;s monologues, then reshot the scenes twice, once with Walter Connolly, because it was felt Jaffe&#x27;s makeup was unconvincing and he looked too young for the role. A total of 40 minutes of footage featuring the High Lama eventually was trimmed to the 12 that appeared in the final cut. Filming took one hundred days, 34 more than scheduled. The film&#x27;s final cost, including prints and promotional advertising, was $2,626,620, and it did not make a profit until it was reissued in 1942.

The first cut of the film was six hours long. The studio considered releasing it in two parts, but eventually decided the idea was impractical. Working with editors Gene Havlick and Gene Milford, Capra managed to trim the running time to 3½ hours for the first preview in Santa Barbara on November 22, 1936. Following a showing of the screwball comedy &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot;, the audience was not receptive to a drama of epic length. Many walked out, and those who remained laughed at sequences intended to be serious. The feedback was mostly negative, and Capra was so distraught, he fled to Lake Arrowhead and remained in seclusion there for several days. He later claimed he burned the first two reels of the film, an account disputed by Milford, who noted setting the nitrate film on fire would have created a devastating explosion.

Following the disastrous preview, Capra made extensive cuts, and on January 12, 1937, reshot scenes involving the High Lama written by Sidney Buchman, who declined screen credit for his work. The new footage placed more emphasis on the growing desperation of the world situation at the time. A world premiere was held at the Lincoln Theater in Miami Beach, Florida on February 18, 1937.

Still unhappy with the film&#x27;s length, Harry Cohn intervened and edited the film personally. When the edited version premiered in San Francisco on March 2, it was 132 minutes long. During the film&#x27;s initial release in selected cities, it was a roadshow attraction, with only two presentations per day and tickets sold on a reserved-seat basis. Because the box-office returns were so low, the studio head cut an additional 14 minutes to slightly less than two hours (118 minutes) before the film went into general release on September 1. Due primarily to the cuts made without his approval, Capra later filed a lawsuit against Columbia, citing &quot;contractual disagreements&quot;, among them, the studio&#x27;s refusal to pay him a $100,000 semi-annual salary payment due him. A settlement was reached on November 27, 1937, with Capra collecting his money and being relieved of the obligation of making one of the five films required by his contract. In 1985, Capra claimed that Cohn, whom he described as the &quot;Jewish producer,&quot; trimmed the film simply so theaters could have more daily showings and increase the film&#x27;s chance of turning a profit.

==Reception==

When the movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it, &quot;a grand adventure film, magnificently staged, beautifully photographed, and capitally played.&quot; He continued,

[T]here is no denying the opulence of the production, the impressiveness of the sets, the richness of the costuming, the satisfying attention to large and small detail which makes Hollywood at its best such a generous entertainer. We can deride the screen in its lesser moods, but when the West Coast impresarios decide to shoot the works the resulting pyrotechnics bathe us in a warm and cheerful glow. ... The penultimate scenes are as vivid, swift, and brilliantly achieved as the first. Only the conclusion itself is somehow disappointing. But perhaps that is inescapable, for there can be no truly satisfying end to any fantasy. ... Mr. Capra was guilty of a few directorial clichés, but otherwise it was a perfect job. Unquestionably the picture has the best photography and sets of the year. By all means it is worth seeing.

Nugent later named it one of the 10 best films of the year.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it &quot;an artistic tour de force ... in all ways, a triumph for Frank Capra.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;sterling&quot; adaptation of Hilton&#x27;s novel that &quot;can take its place with the best prestige pictures of the industry.&quot; &quot;The Film Daily&quot; declared it an &quot;Impressive and artistic drama&quot; and &quot;distinctly a worthwhile contribution to the industry.&quot;

Less enthusiastic was Otis Ferguson, who in his review for &quot;National Board of Review Magazine&quot; observed, &quot;This film was made with obvious care and expense, but it will be notable in the future only as the first wrong step in a career that till now has been a denial of the very tendencies in pictures which this film represents.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised the &quot;beautiful flying scenes&quot; and the &quot;wild and terrifying bits of struggle on mountain peaks and crags&quot;, but found the adaptation in general to be &quot;somewhat longish and wearisome on the screen. I thought the old lama would go on talking forever.&quot; Joseph McBride in a later biography notes that Capra&#x27;s emphasis on theme rather than people was evident in the film; he also considered the film a financial &quot;debacle&quot;.

In &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Graham Greene agreed with the less enthusiastic American reviewers. Nothing reveals men&#x27;s characters more than their Utopias ... this Utopia closely resembles a film star&#x27;s luxurious estate on Beverly Hills: flirtatious pursuits through grape arbours, splashings and divings in blossomy pools under improbable waterfalls, and rich and enormous meals ... something incurably American: a kind of aerated idealism, (&#x27;We have one simple rule, Kindness&#x27;) and of course, a girl (Miss Jane Wyatt, one of the dumber stars), who has read all the best books (this one included) and has the coy comradely manner of a not too advanced schoolmistress. For Greene, the film is &quot;very long&quot; and &quot;very dull ... as soon as the opening scenes are over&quot;. He also regretted the film&#x27;s missed opportunities: &quot;If the long, dull ethical sequences had been cut to the bone there would have been plenty of room for the real story: the shock of Western crudity and injustice on a man returned from a more gentle and beautiful way of life&quot;.

&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; earned theatrical rentals of $3.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.

==Awards and nominations==
Stephen Goosson&#x27;s elaborate sets won him the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, and Gene Havlick and Gene Milford shared the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, but lost to &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot;. H.B. Warner lost the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor to Joseph Schildkraut for the same film. Although Dimitri Tiomkin composed the music, the nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Score went to Morris Stoloff, the head of the music department at Columbia Pictures. The Oscar went to Charles Previn of Universal Pictures for &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot;. John P. Livadary was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound Recording, but lost to Thomas Moulton for &quot;The Hurricane&quot;. Charles C. Coleman, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Assistant Director, lost to Robert Webb for &quot;In Old Chicago&quot;. This was the last year an Oscar was awarded in this category.

;American Film Institute (AFI) list nominations:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)
* AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 – Fantasy Film

==Later reissues and remakes==
In 1942, the film was re-released as &quot;The Lost Horizon of Shangri-La&quot;. A lengthy drunken speech delivered by Robert Conway, in which he cynically mocks war and diplomacy, had already been deleted in the general release version. Capra felt the film made no sense without the scene, and in later years film critic Leslie Halliwell described the missing 12 minutes as &quot;vital&quot;. They were restored years later.

In 1952, a 92-minute version of the film was released. It aimed to play down features of the utopia that suggested communist ideals, a sensitive point after a civil war in China resulted in the ascension of Mao Zedong&#x27;s Communist Party in that country in 1949.

In 1973, the AFI initiated a restoration of the film. The project was undertaken by the UCLA Film and Television Archive (under the supervision of Robert Gitt) and Columbia Pictures and took 13 years to complete. Although all 132 minutes of the original soundtrack were recovered, only 125 minutes of film could be found, so the seven minutes of missing film footage were replaced with a combination of publicity photos of the actors in costume taken during filming and still frames depicting the missing scenes.

Also in 1973, Columbia Pictures produced a modernized musical remake directed by Charles Jarrott and starring Peter Finch and Liv Ullmann. The film featured a score by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. It was both a critical and financial disaster. It came at the end of an era of expensive musical films ushered in by the huge success, in turn, of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

==Adaptations to other media==
&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; was adapted as a radio play starring Ronald Colman and Donald Crisp for the September 15, 1941, broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;. Colman reprised his role for the November 27, 1946, broadcast of &quot;Academy Award&quot; and the July 24, 1948, broadcast of &quot;Favorite Story&quot;.

In 1946, Ronald Colman also made a three-record, 78 rpm album based on the film for American Decca Records. The score for the album was by Victor Young.

Another radio adaptation starring Herbert Marshall was broadcast on December 30, 1948, on &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot;.

A three-part radio dramatisation was made by the BBC and released in September 1981. It featured Derek Jacobi as Hugh Conway.

A stage musical called &quot;Shangri-La&quot; was produced on Broadway in 1956, but closed after only 21 performances. It was staged for a 1960 &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; television broadcast.

==Restoration and home media==
&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; suffered various losses to its original running time over the years:
* March 1937 premiere version: 132 minutes
* September 1937 general release version: 118 minutes
* 1942 re-release: 110 minutes
* 1948 re-release: restored to 118 minutes
* 1952 television version: 92 minutes — the only version in circulation for several decades.
* 1986 photochemical restoration: 132 minutes — 125 minutes of footage synchronised to complete premiere version soundtrack; film freeze frames and on-set publicity photos fill in the blank sections.
* 1998 digital restoration: 132 minutes — further work was carried out on the 1986 restoration.
* 2016 all-new 4K digital restoration: 132 minutes – 126 minutes of footage synchronised to premiere soundtrack, after an extra minute of missing film was discovered.
* 2024 on 19 November a new 133 minute 4K UHD version with Dolby Vision will be released by Sony as part of the &#x27;Frank Capra at Columbia&#x27; boxset; English DTS-HD MA Mono Audio; Includes Commentary with Charles Champlin and Bob Gitt, Alternate Ending, 4 Featurettes, 5 Theatrical Teasers &amp; Trailers

All three restorations have been released or licensed numerous times worldwide on home video by Sony and its predecessor, Columbia Pictures. The 1986 restoration was released on VHS and LaserDisc, while the 1998 restoration was issued on DVD. The 2016 restoration has been released as a digital download and on Blu-ray in various territories, including Australia, the United States and much of Europe.

<text>One Hundred Men and a Girl (styled 100 Men and a Girl in advertising) is a 1937 American musical comedy film directed by Henry Koster and starring Deanna Durbin and the maestro Leopold Stokowski. Written by Charles Kenyon, Bruce Manning, and James Mulhauser from a story by Hanns Kräly, the film is about the daughter of a struggling musician who forms a symphony orchestra consisting of his unemployed friends. Through persistence, charm, and a few misunderstandings, they are able to get famed conductor Leopold Stokowski to lead them in a concert, which leads to a radio contract. &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot; was the first of two motion pictures featuring Leopold Stokowski, and is also one of the films for which Durbin is best remembered as an actress and a singer.

==Plot==
John Cardwell, a trombone player, is only one of a large group of unemployed musicians. He tries unsuccessfully to gain an interview and audition with Leopold Stokowski, but not to disappoint his daughter, Patricia (Patsy), he tells her that he has managed to get the job with Stokowski&#x27;s orchestra. Patsy soon learns the truth and also learns that her father, desperate for rent money, has used some of the cash in a lady&#x27;s evening bag he has found to pay his debts.

The irrepressible and wilful Patsy seeks an interview with Mrs. Frost, whose bag it was, and confesses her father&#x27;s actions. Mrs. Frost, a society matron and wife of rich radio station owner John R. Frost, lightheartedly offers to sponsor an orchestra of unemployed musicians. Taking her at her word, Patsy and her father recruit 100 musicians, rent a garage space and start to rehearse. Realizing that Patsy took her seriously, Mrs. Frost flees to Europe.

Mr. Frost tells John and his friends that he will not sponsor them, as they had supposed, unless they can attract a well-recognized guest conductor to give them a &#x27;name&#x27; and launch them on their opening night.

Patsy, undaunted, sets out to recruit none other than Leopold Stokowski to be that conductor. Stokowski at first definitely refuses—though when Patsy sings as the orchestra is rehearsing Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Alleluia&quot; from &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot;, he strongly suggests that she seek professional voice training and eventual representation.

By mistake, Patsy conveys the story to a newspaper music critic that Stokowski will conduct an orchestra of unemployed musicians, and that John R. Frost would broadcast the concert on the radio. When the story breaks, Frost protests his embarrassment to his friends, but they suggest valuable publicity would result. Frost immediately signs the one-hundred-man orchestra to a contract, though Patsy tries to tell them that Stokowski has not agreed.

Stokowski is astonished and offended at the news, but Patsy enters Stokowski&#x27;s palatial house surreptitiously, along with the entire orchestra. She apologizes to him and insists that he listen to the players. The conductor is so moved by their performance of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot; that he postpones a European tour and agrees to the engagement.

The concert is a rousing success for everyone, especially when Patsy, called upon to make a speech, instead agrees to sing the &quot;Brindisi&quot; (Drinking Song) from Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;La traviata&quot;.

==Production==
===Background===
&quot;Everybody said you can&#x27;t top &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot;&quot;, said Pasternak years later. &quot;I said you can top anything as long as you&#x27;re honest, you don&#x27;t fool yourself, you get the right subject and you create a public taste for it.&quot;

The film was originally called &quot;120 Men and One Girl&quot; and was announced in December 1936. It was based on an original story and screenplay by Hans Kraly.

Leopold Stokowski was, at the time of the film&#x27;s release, co-conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra with Eugene Ormandy. Political and artistic differences with the orchestra&#x27;s board had already led Stokowski to allow Ormandy to assume a greater leadership role at the orchestra and eventually would lead Stokowski to break with the orchestra entirely. This might explain why the city in which the film is set, and by extension Stokowski&#x27;s &quot;regular&quot; orchestra, is never positively identified in the film. The music was recorded in multi-channel stereophonic sound but released in monaural sound; three years later Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra appeared in the first feature film to be presented in stereo, &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Jane Barlow, ballerina and a student of Nijinska, was a body double for Deanna Durbin in this film.

Casting Stokowski was reportedly Durbin&#x27;s idea. Stokowski signed to make the film in February 1937. His fee was reportedly $80,000. Paramount objected saying they had signed a contract with the conductor but it turned out this was only verbal. Filming started in March.

* &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Sunbeams&quot; (Friedrich Hollaender, Sam Coslow) performed by Deanna Durbin

* &quot;Alleluja&quot; from the motet &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot; (K.165) (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) performed by Deanna Durbin

==Reception==
The film opened to highly favorable critical reviews and is remembered as a hit. Of all the elements of the film, Deanna Durbin&#x27;s ability to both sing &quot;and&quot; act drew the highest praise.

===Awards and honors===
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In addition, Charles Previn, in his role as head of the music department for Universal Pictures, won the Academy Award for Original Music Score. (No specific composer credit was ever specified.) Previn&#x27;s scoring consisted of using two original songs (by Sam Coslow and Friedrich Hollaender) and a carefully chosen selection of music from classical symphonic works and operas. The other three awards for which this film was nominated were Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing (Homer G. Tasker), and Best Original Story.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

<text>Stage Door is a 1937 American tragicomedy film directed by Gregory La Cava. Adapted from the 1936 play of the same name, it tells the story of several would-be actresses who live together in a boarding house at 158 West 58th Street in New York City. The film stars Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Adolphe Menjou, Gail Patrick, Constance Collier, Andrea Leeds, Samuel S. Hinds and Lucille Ball. It was produced and distributed by RKO Pictures. Eve Arden and Ann Miller, who became notable in later films, play minor characters.

The film was adapted by Morrie Ryskind and Anthony Veiller from the play by Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman, but the play&#x27;s storyline and the characters&#x27; names were almost completely changed for the movie, so much so in fact that Kaufman joked the film should be called &quot;Screen Door&quot;.

==Plot==

Terry Randall (Katharine Hepburn) moves into the Footlights Club, a theatrical boarding house in New York. Her polished manners and superior attitude make her no friends among the rest of the aspiring actresses living there, particularly her new roommate, flippant, cynical dancer Jean Maitland (Ginger Rogers). From Terry&#x27;s expensive clothing and her photograph of her elderly grandfather, Jean assumes she has obtained the former from her , just as fellow resident Linda Shaw (Gail Patrick) has from her relationship with influential theatrical producer Anthony Powell (Adolphe Menjou). In truth, Terry comes from a wealthy Midwest family. Over the strong objections of her father, Henry Sims (Samuel S. Hinds), she is determined to try to fulfill her dreams. In the boarding house, Terry&#x27;s only supporter is aging actress Anne Luther (Constance Collier), who appoints herself Terry&#x27;s mentor and acting coach.

When Powell sees Jean dancing, he decides to dump Linda. He arranges for Jean and her partner Annie (Ann Miller) to get hired for the floor show of a nightclub he partly owns. He then starts dating Jean, who starts falling for him.

Meanwhile, well-liked Kay Hamilton (Andrea Leeds) had great success and rave reviews in a play the year before but has had no work since and is running out of money. She clings desperately to the hope of landing the leading role in Powell&#x27;s new play, &quot;Enchanted April&quot;. She finally gets an appointment to see Powell, only to have him cancel. She faints in the reception area, the result of malnutrition and disappointment. Seeing this, Terry barges into Powell&#x27;s private office and berates him for his callousness. As a result, the other boarding house residents start to warm up to the newcomer.

Terry&#x27;s father secretly finances &quot;Enchanted April&quot; on the condition that Terry is given the starring role, hoping she will fail and return home. Powell invites Terry to his penthouse to break the news. When Jean shows up unannounced, Terry sees the opportunity to save her friend from the philandering Powell. She pretends that Powell is trying to seduce her. It works. However, it makes things uncomfortable around the boarding house. Terry&#x27;s landing on the plum part breaks Kay&#x27;s heart.

The inexperienced Terry is so woodenly bad during rehearsals that Powell tries to get out of his contract with Sims. On opening night, after she learns from Jean that Kay has committed suicide, Terry decides she cannot go on. Anne Luther tells her that she must, not just for herself and the tradition of the theatre, but also for Kay. She does and gives a heartfelt performance. She and the play are a hit, much to the chagrin of her father, who is in the audience. At her curtain call, Terry gives a speech in tribute to her dead friend, and Terry and Jean are reconciled. The play remains a success after months, but Terry continues to board at the Footlights Club. A newcomer shows up looking for a room.

==Cast==

* Eve Arden as Eve
* Ann Miller as Annie
* Franklin Pangborn as Harcourt, Powell&#x27;s butler
* William Corson as Bill
* Pierre Watkin as Richard Carmichael
* Grady Sutton as &quot;Butch&quot;
* Frank Reicher as Stage Director
* Jack Carson as Mr. Milbanks, a lumberman from Seattle who takes Jean to dinner
* Phyllis Kennedy as Hattie
* Margaret Early as Mary Lou
* Florence Reed (uncredited)

==Production==

The writers listened to the young actresses talking and joking off set during rehearsals and incorporated their style of talking into the film. Director Gregory La Cava also allowed the actresses to ad lib during filming. Hepburn&#x27;s famous lines during the play within the film, &quot;The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower, suitable to any occasion. I carried them on my wedding day and now I place them here in memory of something that has died,&quot; are from &quot;The Lake&quot; (1934), the play for which Dorothy Parker panned Hepburn&#x27;s performance as &quot;running the gamut of emotions from A to B.&quot;

The movie has almost nothing to do with the play, except in a few character names, such as Kay Hamilton, Jean Maitland, Terry Randall, Linda Shaw, and Judith Canfield. In the play, Terry Randall is from a rural family whose father is a country doctor, and Jean Maitland is actually a shallow girl who becomes a movie star. Kay Hamilton does commit suicide, but for completely different reasons and not on an opening night.

==Reception==
The film received very good reviews and was a moderate success at the box office. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of January 3, 1938, after the film&#x27;s London premiere at the Regal on December 31, 1937:
Hepburn&#x27;s four movies preceding &quot;Stage Door&quot; had been commercial failures. However, as a result of the positive response to this performance, RKO immediately cast her opposite Cary Grant in the screwball comedy &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938).

&quot;Stage Door&quot; made a small profit of $81,000.

===Academy Awards===

;Nominations
* Outstanding Production: RKO Radio
* Best Director: Gregory La Cava
* Best Supporting Actress: Andrea Leeds
* Best Writing (Screenplay): Morris Ryskind, Anthony Veiller

==Home media==
After Kay commits suicide, there is a brief shot of her grave as part of the montage of the success of the play, which was once edited out on all TV showings and is not in the original US VHS and Betamax releases. The shot was restored for DVD and subsequent TV broadcasts. As of 2025, &quot;Stage Door&quot; has been released on DVD in the US, UK, Italy, France and Spain on various labels including Warner Bros. and Sony.

==Other adaptations==
A 60-minute radio version of &quot;Stage Door&quot; was performed on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on February 20, 1939, broadcast over the CBS Radio network. Ginger Rogers and Adolphe Menjou reprised their roles from the film, while Rosalind Russell replaced Katharine Hepburn as Terry Randall. Eve Arden, who played minor character Eve in the film, replaced Gail Patrick as Linda Shaw. The radio broadcast was included as a bonus feature on the 2005 Warner Bros. DVD release of the film.

&quot;Stage Door&quot; was presented on CBS Radio again on December 5, 1941 on &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse&quot;. The 30-minute adaptation by Charles Martin starred Geraldine Fitzgerald as Terry Randall.

On April 6, 1955, a 60-minute version of the play, adapted by Gore Vidal, aired on the CBS Television series &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot;. It starred Rhonda Fleming, Elsa Lanchester, Diana Lynn, and Victor Moore.

<doc id="61532" wikidata="Q332465" url="?curid=61532" title="Absolute convergence">
<text>In mathematics, an infinite series of numbers is said to converge absolutely (or to be absolutely convergent) if the sum of the absolute values of the summands is finite. More precisely, a real or complex series formula_1 is said to converge absolutely if formula_2 for some real number formula_3 Similarly, an improper integral of a function, formula_4 is said to converge absolutely if the integral of the absolute value of the integrand is finite—that is, if formula_5 A convergent series that is not absolutely convergent is called conditionally convergent.

Absolute convergence is important for the study of infinite series, because its definition guarantees that a series will have some &quot;nice&quot; behaviors of finite sums that not all convergent series possess. For instance, rearrangements do not change the value of the sum, which is not necessarily true for conditionally convergent series.

==Background==
When adding a finite number of terms, addition is both associative and commutative, meaning that grouping and rearrangment do not alter the final sum. For instance, formula_6 is equal to both formula_7 and formula_8. However, associativity and commutativity do not necessarily hold for infinite sums. One example is the alternating harmonic series

formula_9

whose terms are fractions that alternate in sign. This series is convergent and can be evaluated using the Maclaurin series for the function formula_10, which converges for all formula_11 satisfying formula_12:

formula_13

Substituting formula_14 reveals that the original sum is equal to formula_15. The sum can also be rearranged as follows:

formula_16

In this rearrangement, the reciprocal of each odd number is grouped with the reciprocal of twice its value, while the reciprocals of every multiple of 4 are evaluated separately. However, evaluating the terms inside the parentheses yields 

formula_17 

or half the original series. The violation of the associativity and commutativity of addition reveals that the alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent. Indeed, the sum of the absolute values of each term is formula_18, or the divergent harmonic series. According to the Riemann series theorem, any conditionally convergent series can be permuted so that its sum is any finite real number or so that it diverges. When an absolutely convergent series is rearranged, its sum is always preserved.

== Definition for real and complex numbers ==
A sum of real numbers or complex numbers formula_19 is absolutely convergent if the sum of the absolute values of the terms formula_20 converges.

== Sums of more general elements ==

The same definition can be used for series formula_19 whose terms formula_22 are not numbers but rather elements of an arbitrary abelian topological group. In that case, instead of using the absolute value, the definition requires the group to have a norm, which is a positive real-valued function formula_23 on an abelian group formula_24 (written additively, with identity element 0) such that:
# The norm of the identity element of formula_24 is zero: formula_26
# For every formula_27 formula_28 implies formula_29
# For every formula_27 formula_31
# For every formula_32 formula_33

In this case, the function formula_34 induces the structure of a metric space (a type of topology) on formula_35 

Then, a formula_24-valued series is absolutely convergent if formula_37

In particular, these statements apply using the norm formula_38 (absolute value) in the space of real numbers or complex numbers.

=== In topological vector spaces ===

If formula_39 is a topological vector space (TVS) and formula_40 is a (possibly uncountable) family in formula_39 then this family is absolutely summable if 
# formula_40 is summable in formula_39 (that is, if the limit formula_44 of the net formula_45 converges in formula_46 where formula_47 is the directed set of all finite subsets of formula_48 directed by inclusion formula_49 and formula_50), and 
# for every continuous seminorm formula_51 on formula_46 the family formula_53 is summable in formula_54
If formula_39 is a normable space and if formula_40 is an absolutely summable family in formula_46 then necessarily all but a countable collection of formula_58&#x27;s are 0.

Absolutely summable families play an important role in the theory of nuclear spaces.

==Relation to convergence==

If formula_24 is complete with respect to the metric formula_60 then every absolutely convergent series is convergent. The proof is the same as for complex-valued series: use the completeness to derive the Cauchy criterion for convergence—a series is convergent if and only if its tails can be made arbitrarily small in norm—and apply the triangle inequality.

In particular, for series with values in any Banach space, absolute convergence implies convergence. The converse is also true: if absolute convergence implies convergence in a normed space, then the space is a Banach space.

If a series is convergent but not absolutely convergent, it is called conditionally convergent. An example of a conditionally convergent series is the alternating harmonic series. Many standard tests for divergence and convergence, most notably including the ratio test and the root test, demonstrate absolute convergence. This is because a power series is absolutely convergent on the interior of its disk of convergence.

===Proof that any absolutely convergent series of complex numbers is convergent===

Suppose that formula_61 is convergent. Then equivalently, formula_62 is convergent, which implies that formula_63 and formula_64 converge by termwise comparison of non-negative terms. It suffices to show that the convergence of these series implies the convergence of formula_65 and formula_66 for then, the convergence of formula_67 would follow, by the definition of the convergence of complex-valued series.

The preceding discussion shows that we need only prove that convergence of formula_68 implies the convergence of formula_69

Let formula_68 be convergent. Since formula_71 we have
formula_72
Since formula_73 is convergent, formula_74 is a bounded monotonic sequence of partial sums, and formula_75 must also converge. Noting that formula_76 is the difference of convergent series, we conclude that it too is a convergent series, as desired.

==== Alternative proof using the Cauchy criterion and triangle inequality ====

By applying the Cauchy criterion for the convergence of a complex series, we can also prove this fact as a simple implication of the triangle inequality. By the Cauchy criterion, formula_77 converges if and only if for any formula_78 there exists formula_79 such that formula_80 for any formula_81 But the triangle inequality implies that formula_82 so that formula_83 for any formula_84 which is exactly the Cauchy criterion for formula_85

===Proof that any absolutely convergent series in a Banach space is convergent===

The above result can be easily generalized to every Banach space formula_86 Let formula_87 be an absolutely convergent series in formula_88 As formula_89 is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers, for any formula_90 and large enough natural numbers formula_91 it holds:
formula_92

By the triangle inequality for the norm , one immediately gets:
formula_93
which means that formula_94 is a Cauchy sequence in formula_46 hence the series is convergent in formula_88

==Rearrangements and unconditional convergence==
===Real and complex numbers===

When a series of real or complex numbers is absolutely convergent, any rearrangement or reordering of that series&#x27; terms will still converge to the same value. This fact is one reason absolutely convergent series are useful: showing a series is absolutely convergent allows terms to be paired or rearranged in convenient ways without changing the sum&#x27;s value.

The Riemann rearrangement theorem shows that the converse is also true: every real or complex-valued series whose terms cannot be reordered to give a different value is absolutely convergent. 

===Series with coefficients in more general space===
The term unconditional convergence is used to refer to a series where any rearrangement of its terms still converges to the same value. For any series with values in a normed abelian group formula_24, as long as formula_24 is complete, every series which converges absolutely also converges unconditionally.

Stated more formally:
For series with more general coefficients, the converse is more complicated. As stated in the previous section, for real-valued and complex-valued series, unconditional convergence always implies absolute convergence. However, in the more general case of a series with values in any normed abelian group formula_24, the converse does not always hold: there can exist series which are not absolutely convergent, yet unconditionally convergent.

For example, in the Banach space ℓ∞, one series which is unconditionally convergent but not absolutely convergent is:
formula_100

where formula_101 is an orthonormal basis. A theorem of A. Dvoretzky and C. A. Rogers asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space has an unconditionally convergent series that is not absolutely convergent.

===Proof of the theorem===

For any formula_78 we can choose some formula_103 such that:
formula_104

Let
formula_105
where formula_106 so that formula_107 is the smallest natural number such that the list formula_108 includes all of the terms formula_109 (and possibly others).

Finally for any integer formula_110 let
formula_111
so that 
formula_112
and thus
formula_113

This shows that
formula_114
that is:
formula_115

Q.E.D.

==Products of series==

The Cauchy product of two series converges to the product of the sums if at least one of the series converges absolutely. That is, suppose that
formula_116

The Cauchy product is defined as the sum of terms formula_117 where:
formula_118

If the formula_22 or formula_120 sum converges absolutely then
formula_121

==Absolute convergence over sets==

A generalization of the absolute convergence of a series, is the absolute convergence of a sum of a function over a set. We can first consider a countable set formula_39 and a function formula_123 We will give a definition below of the sum of formula_124 over formula_46 written as formula_126 

First note that because no particular enumeration (or &quot;indexing&quot;) of formula_39 has yet been specified, the series formula_128 cannot be understood by the more basic definition of a series. In fact, for certain examples of formula_39 and formula_130 the sum of formula_124 over formula_39 may not be defined at all, since some indexing may produce a conditionally convergent series. 

Therefore we define formula_133 only in the case where there exists some bijection formula_134 such that formula_135 is absolutely convergent. Note that here, &quot;absolutely convergent&quot; uses the more basic definition, applied to an indexed series. In this case, the value of the sum of formula_124 over formula_39 is defined by 
formula_138

Note that because the series is absolutely convergent, then every rearrangement is identical to a different choice of bijection formula_139 Since all of these sums have the same value, then the sum of formula_124 over formula_39 is well-defined. 

Even more generally we may define the sum of formula_124 over formula_39 when formula_39 is uncountable. But first we define what it means for the sum to be convergent.

Let formula_39 be any set, countable or uncountable, and formula_146 a function. We say that the sum of formula_124 over formula_39 converges absolutely if 
formula_149

There is a theorem which states that, if the sum of formula_124 over formula_39 is absolutely convergent, then formula_124 takes non-zero values on a set that is at most countable. Therefore, the following is a consistent definition of the sum of formula_124 over formula_39 when the sum is absolutely convergent. 
formula_155

Note that the final series uses the definition of a series over a countable set.

Some authors define an iterated sum formula_156 to be absolutely convergent if the iterated series formula_157 This is in fact equivalent to the absolute convergence of formula_158 That is to say, if the sum of formula_124 over formula_46 formula_161 converges absolutely, as defined above, then the iterated sum formula_156 converges absolutely, and vice versa.

==Absolute convergence of integrals==

The integral formula_163 of a real or complex-valued function is said to converge absolutely if formula_164 One also says that formula_124 is absolutely integrable. The issue of absolute integrability is intricate and depends on whether the Riemann, Lebesgue, or Kurzweil-Henstock (gauge) integral is considered; for the Riemann integral, it also depends on whether we only consider integrability in its proper sense (formula_124 and formula_48 both bounded), or permit the more general case of improper integrals.

As a standard property of the Riemann integral, when formula_168 is a bounded interval, every continuous function is bounded and (Riemann) integrable, and since formula_124 continuous implies formula_170 continuous, every continuous function is absolutely integrable. In fact, since formula_171 is Riemann integrable on formula_172 if formula_124 is (properly) integrable and formula_174 is continuous, it follows that formula_175 is properly Riemann integrable if formula_124 is. However, this implication does not hold in the case of improper integrals. For instance, the function formula_177 is improperly Riemann integrable on its unbounded domain, but it is not absolutely integrable:
formula_178
Indeed, more generally, given any series formula_179 one can consider the associated step function formula_180 defined by formula_181 Then formula_182 converges absolutely, converges conditionally or diverges according to the corresponding behavior of formula_183

The situation is different for the Lebesgue integral, which does not handle bounded and unbounded domains of integration separately (&quot;see below&quot;). The fact that the integral of formula_170 is unbounded in the examples above implies that formula_124 is also not integrable in the Lebesgue sense. In fact, in the Lebesgue theory of integration, given that formula_124 is measurable, formula_124 is (Lebesgue) integrable if and only if formula_170 is (Lebesgue) integrable. However, the hypothesis that formula_124 is measurable is crucial; it is not generally true that absolutely integrable functions on formula_172 are integrable (simply because they may fail to be measurable): let formula_191 be a nonmeasurable subset and consider formula_192 where formula_193 is the characteristic function of formula_194 Then formula_124 is not Lebesgue measurable and thus not integrable, but formula_196 is a constant function and clearly integrable.

On the other hand, a function formula_124 may be Kurzweil-Henstock integrable (gauge integrable) while formula_170 is not. This includes the case of improperly Riemann integrable functions.

In a general sense, on any measure space formula_199 the Lebesgue integral of a real-valued function is defined in terms of its positive and negative parts, so the facts:

# formula_124 integrable implies formula_170 integrable
# formula_124 measurable, formula_170 integrable implies formula_124 integrable

are essentially built into the definition of the Lebesgue integral. In particular, applying the theory to the counting measure on a set formula_205 one recovers the notion of unordered summation of series developed by Moore–Smith using (what are now called) nets. When formula_206 is the set of natural numbers, Lebesgue integrability, unordered summability and absolute convergence all coincide.

Finally, all of the above holds for integrals with values in a Banach space. The definition of a Banach-valued Riemann integral is an evident modification of the usual one. For the Lebesgue integral one needs to circumvent the decomposition into positive and negative parts with Daniell&#x27;s more functional analytic approach, obtaining the Bochner integral.

<doc id="61534" wikidata="Q103237" url="?curid=61534" title="Australopithecus">
<text>Australopithecus (, ; or (, ) is a genus of early hominins that existed in Africa during the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. The genera &quot;Homo&quot; (which includes modern humans), &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, and &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; evolved from some &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species. &quot;Australopithecus&quot; is a member of the subtribe Australopithecina, which sometimes also includes &quot;Ardipithecus&quot;, though the term &quot;australopithecine&quot; is sometimes used to refer only to members of &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. Species include &quot;A. garhi&quot;, &quot;A. africanus&quot;, &quot;A. sediba&quot;, &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, &quot;A. anamensis&quot;, &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot;, and &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot;. Debate exists as to whether some &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species should be reclassified into new genera, or if &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; are synonymous with &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, in part because of the taxonomic inconsistency.

Furthermore, because e.g. &quot;A. africanus&quot; is more closely related to humans, or their ancestors at the time, than e.g. &quot;A. anamensis&quot; and many more &quot;Australopithecus&quot; branches, &quot;Australopithecus&quot; cannot be consolidated into a coherent grouping without also including the &quot;Homo&quot; genus and other genera.

The earliest known member of the genus, &quot;A. anamensis&quot;, existed in eastern Africa around 4.2 million years ago. &quot;Australopithecus&quot; fossils become more widely dispersed throughout eastern and southern Africa (the Chadian &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot; indicates that the genus was much more widespread than the fossil record suggests), before eventually becoming extinct 1.9 million years ago (or 1.2 to 0.6 million years ago if &quot;Paranthropus&quot; is included). While none of the groups normally directly assigned to this group survived, &quot;Australopithecus&quot; gave rise to living descendants, as the genus &quot;Homo&quot; emerged from an &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species at some time between 3 and 2 million years ago.

&quot;Australopithecus&quot; possessed two of the three duplicated genes derived from &quot;SRGAP2&quot; roughly 3.4 and 2.4 million years ago (&quot;SRGAP2B&quot; and &quot;SRGAP2C&quot;), the second of which contributed to the increase in number and migration of neurons in the human brain. Significant changes to the hand first appear in the fossil record of later &quot;A. afarensis&quot; about 3 million years ago (fingers shortened relative to thumb and changes to the joints between the index finger and the trapezium and capitate).

===Research history===

The first &quot;Australopithecus&quot; specimen, the type specimen, was discovered in 1924 in a lime quarry by workers at Taung, South Africa. The specimen was studied by the Australian anatomist Raymond Dart, who was then working at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The fossil skull was from a three-year-old bipedal primate (nicknamed Taung Child) that he named &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;. The first report was published in &quot;Nature&quot; in February 1925. Dart realised that the fossil contained a number of humanoid features, and so he came to the conclusion that this was an early human ancestor. Later, Scottish paleontologist Robert Broom and Dart set out to search for more early hominin specimens, and several more &quot;A. africanus&quot; remains from various sites. Initially, anthropologists were largely hostile to the idea that these discoveries were anything but apes, though this changed during the late 1940s.

In 1950, evolutionary biologist Ernst Walter Mayr said that all bipedal apes should be classified into the genus &quot;Homo&quot;, and considered renaming &quot;Australopithecus&quot; to &quot;Homo transvaalensis&quot;. However, the contrary view taken by J.T. Robinson in 1954, excluding australopiths from &quot;Homo&quot;, became the prevalent view. The first australopithecine fossil discovered in eastern Africa was an &quot;A. boisei&quot; skull excavated by Mary Leakey in 1959 in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Since then, the Leakey family has continued to excavate the gorge, uncovering further evidence for australopithecines, as well as for &quot;Homo habilis&quot; and &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. The scientific community took 20 more years to widely accept &quot;Australopithecus&quot; as a member of the human family tree.

In 1997, an almost complete &quot;Australopithecus&quot; skeleton with skull was found in the Sterkfontein caves of Gauteng, South Africa. It is now called &quot;Little Foot&quot; and it is around 3.7 million years old. It was named &quot;Australopithecus prometheus&quot; which has since been placed within &quot;A. africanus&quot;. Other fossil remains found in the same cave in 2008 were named &quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot;, which lived 1.9 million years ago. &quot;A. africanus&quot; probably evolved into &quot;A. sediba&quot;, which some scientists think may have evolved into &quot;H. erectus&quot;, though this is heavily disputed.

In 2003, Spanish writer Camilo José Cela Conde and evolutionary biologist Francisco J. Ayala proposed resurrecting the genus &quot;Praeanthropus&quot; to house &quot;Orrorin&quot;, &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, &quot;A. anamensis&quot;, &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot;, and &quot;A. garhi&quot;, but this genus has been largely dismissed.

===Classification===
With the apparent emergence of the genera &quot;Homo, Kenyanthropus&quot;, and &quot;Paranthropus&quot; in the genus &quot;Australopithecus,&quot; taxonomy runs into some difficulty, as the name of species incorporates their genus. According to cladistics, groups should not be left paraphyletic, where it is kept not consisting of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. Resolving this problem would cause major ramifications in the nomenclature of all descendent species. Possibilities suggested have been to rename &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; to &quot;Australopithecus sapiens&quot; (or even &quot;Pan sapiens&quot;), or to move some &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species into new genera. A study reported in 2025 reported preliminary success in extracting ancient proteins from an Australopithic tooth, suggesting that paleoproteomics has the potential to provide information about the genetic affinities of the species.

In 2002 and again in 2007, Camilo José Cela Conde &quot;et al.&quot; suggested that &quot;A. africanus&quot; be moved to &quot;Paranthropus&quot;. On the basis of craniodental evidence, Strait and Grine (2004) suggest that &quot;A. anamensis&quot; and &quot;A. garhi&quot; should be assigned to new genera. It is debated whether or not &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot; should be considered simply a western variant of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; instead of a separate species.

==Evolution ==
&quot;A. anamensis&quot; may have descended from or was closely related to &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot;. &quot;A. anamensis&quot; shows some similarities to both &quot;Ar. ramidus&quot; and &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot;.

Australopiths shared several traits with modern apes and humans, and were widespread throughout Eastern and Northern Africa by 3.5 million years ago (mya). The earliest evidence of fundamentally bipedal hominins is a (3.6 mya) fossil trackway in Laetoli, Tanzania, which bears a remarkable similarity to those of modern humans. The footprints have generally been classified as australopith, as they are the only form of prehuman hominins known to have existed in that region at that time.

According to the Chimpanzee Genome Project, the human–chimpanzee last common ancestor existed about five to six million years ago, assuming a constant rate of mutation. However, hominin species dated to earlier than the date could call this into question. &quot;Sahelanthropus tchadensis&quot;, commonly called &quot;Toumai&quot;, is about seven million years old and &quot;Orrorin tugenensis&quot; lived at least six million years ago. Since little is known of them, they remain controversial among scientists since the molecular clock in humans has determined that humans and chimpanzees had a genetic split at least a million years later. One theory suggests that the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged somewhat at first, then some populations interbred around one million years after diverging.
==Anatomy==
The brains of most species of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; were roughly 35% of the size of a modern human brain with an endocranial volume average of . Although this is more than the average endocranial volume of chimpanzee brains at the earliest australopiths (&quot;A. anamensis&quot;) appear to have been within the chimpanzee range, whereas some later australopith specimens have a larger endocranial volume than that of some early Homo fossils.

Most species of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; were diminutive and gracile, usually standing tall. It is possible that they exhibited a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism, males being larger than females. In modern populations, males are on average a mere 15% larger than females, while in &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, males could be up to 50% larger than females by some estimates. However, the degree of sexual dimorphism is debated due to the fragmentary nature of australopith remains. One paper finds that &quot;A. afarensis&quot; had a level of dimorphism close to modern humans.

According to A. Zihlman, &quot;Australopithecus&quot; body proportions closely resemble those of bonobos (&quot;Pan paniscus&quot;), leading evolutionary biologist Jeremy Griffith to suggest that bonobos may be phenotypically similar to &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. Furthermore, thermoregulatory models suggest that australopiths were fully hair covered, more like chimpanzees and bonobos, and unlike humans.

The fossil record seems to indicate that &quot;Australopithecus&quot; is ancestral to &quot;Homo&quot; and modern humans. It was once assumed that large brain size had been a precursor to bipedalism, but the discovery of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; with a small brain but developed bipedality upset this theory. Nonetheless, it remains a matter of controversy as to how bipedalism first emerged. The advantages of bipedalism were that it left the hands free to grasp objects (e.g., carry food and young), and allowed the eyes to look over tall grasses for possible food sources or predators, but it is also argued that these advantages were not significant enough to cause the emergence of bipedalism. Earlier fossils, such as &quot;Orrorin tugenensis&quot;, indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggests that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Major changes to the pelvis and feet had already taken place before &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. It was once thought that humans descended from a knuckle-walking ancestor, but this is not well-supported.

Australopithecines have thirty-two teeth, like modern humans. Their molars were parallel, like those of great apes, and they had a slight pre-canine gap (diastema). Their canines were smaller, like modern humans, and with the teeth less interlocked than in previous hominins. In fact, in some australopithecines, the canines are shaped more like incisors. The molars of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; fit together in much the same way those of humans do, with low crowns and four low, rounded cusps used for crushing. They have cutting edges on the crests. However, australopiths generally evolved a larger postcanine dentition with thicker enamel. Australopiths in general had thick enamel, like &quot;Homo&quot;, while other great apes have markedly thinner enamel. Robust australopiths wore their molar surfaces down flat, unlike the more gracile species, who kept their crests.

==Diet==
&quot;Australopithecus&quot; species are thought to have eaten mainly fruit, vegetables, and tubers, and perhaps easy-to-catch animals such as small lizards. Much research has focused on a comparison between the South African species &quot;A. africanus&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot;. Early analyses of dental microwear in these two species showed, compared to &quot;P. robustus&quot;, &quot;A. africanus&quot; had fewer microwear features and more scratches as opposed to pits on its molar wear facets. Microwear patterns on the cheek teeth of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; and &quot;A. anamensis&quot; indicate that &quot;A. afarensis&quot; predominantly ate fruits and leaves, whereas &quot;A. anamensis&quot; included grasses and seeds (in addition to fruits and leaves). The thickening of enamel in australopiths may have been a response to eating more ground-bound foods such as tubers, nuts, and cereal grains with gritty dirt and other small particulates which would wear away enamel. Gracile australopiths had larger incisors, which indicates tearing food was important, perhaps eating scavenged meat. Nonetheless, the wearing patterns on the teeth support a largely herbivorous diet.

In 1992, trace-element studies of the strontium/calcium ratios in robust australopith fossils suggested the possibility of animal consumption, as they did in 1994 using stable carbon isotopic analysis. In 2005, fossil animal bones with butchery marks dating to 2.6 million years old were found at the site of Gona, Ethiopia. This implies meat consumption by at least one of three species of hominins occurring around that time: &quot;A. africanus&quot;, &quot;A. garhi&quot;, and/or &quot;P. aethiopicus&quot;. In 2010, fossils of butchered animal bones dated 3.4 million years old were found in Ethiopia, close to regions where australopith fossils were found. However, a 2025 study measuring nitrogen isotope ratios in fossilized teeth determined that &quot;Australopithecus&quot; was almost entirely vegetarian.

Robust australopithecines (&quot;Paranthropus&quot;) had larger cheek teeth than gracile australopiths, possibly because robust australopithecines had more tough, fibrous plant material in their diets, whereas gracile australopiths ate more hard and brittle foods. However, such divergence in chewing adaptations may instead have been a response to fallback food availability. In leaner times, robust and gracile australopithecines may have turned to different low-quality foods (fibrous plants for the former, and hard food for the latter), but in more bountiful times, they had more variable and overlapping diets. In a 1979 preliminary microwear study of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; fossil teeth, anthropologist Alan Walker theorized that robust australopiths ate predominantly fruit (frugivory).

A study in 2018 found non-carious cervical lesions, caused by acid erosion, on the teeth of &quot;A. africanus&quot;, probably caused by consumption of acidic fruit.

==Technology==
It is debated if the &quot;Australopithecus&quot; hand was anatomically capable of producing stone tools. &quot;A. garhi&quot; was associated with large mammal bones bearing evidence of processing by stone tools, which may indicate australopithecine tool production. Stone tools dating to roughly the same time as &quot;A. garhi&quot; (about 2.6 mya) were later discovered at the nearby Gona and Ledi-Geraru sites, but the appearance of &quot;Homo&quot; at Ledi-Geraru (LD 350-1) casts doubt on australopithecine authorship.

In 2010, cut marks dating to 3.4 mya on a bovid leg were found at the Dikaka site, which were at first attributed to butchery by &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, but because the fossil came from a sandstone unit (and were modified by abrasive sand and gravel particles during the fossilisation process), the attribution to butchery is dubious.

In 2015, the Lomekwi culture was discovered at Lake Turkana dating to 3.3 mya, possibly attributable to &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; or &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot;.
