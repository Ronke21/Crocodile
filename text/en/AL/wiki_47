<text>The Mellotron is an electro-mechanical musical instrument developed in Birmingham, England, in 1963. It is played by pressing its keys, each of which causes a length of magnetic tape to contact a capstan, which pulls it across a playback head. As the key is released, the tape is retracted by a spring to its initial position. Different portions of the tape can be played to access different sounds.

The Mellotron evolved from the similar Chamberlin, but could be mass-produced more efficiently. The first models were designed for the home and contained a variety of sounds, including automatic accompaniments. Bandleader Eric Robinson and television personality David Nixon helped promote the first instruments, and celebrities such as Princess Margaret were early adopters. It was adopted by rock and pop groups in the mid to late 1960s. One of the first pop songs featuring the Mellotron was Manfred Mann&#x27;s &quot;Semi-Detached, Suburban Mr. James&quot; (1966). The Beatles used it on tracks including the hit single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (1967). 

The Moody Blues keyboardist Mike Pinder used it extensively on the band&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; as well as the group&#x27;s following six albums. During the 1970s, the Mellotron became common in progressive rock, used by groups such as King Crimson, Yes and Genesis. Later models, such as the bestselling M400, dispensed with the accompaniments and some sound selection controls so it could be used by touring musicians. The instrument&#x27;s popularity declined in the 1980s after the introduction of polyphonic synthesizers and samplers, despite high-profile performers such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and XTC continuing to use the instrument.

Production of the Mellotron ceased in 1986, but it regained popularity in the 1990s and was used by bands such as Oasis, the Smashing Pumpkins, Muse, and Radiohead. This led to the resurrection of the original manufacturer, Streetly Electronics. In 2007, Streetly produced the M4000, which combined the layout of the M400 with the bank selection of earlier models.

==Operation==

The Mellotron uses the same concept as a sampler, but generates its sound using analogue recordings on audio tape. When a key is pressed, a tape connected to it is pushed against a playback head, as in a tape deck. While the key remains depressed, the tape is drawn over the head, and a sound is played. When the key is released, a spring pulls the tape back to its original position.

A variety of sounds are available on the instrument. On earlier models, the instrument is split into &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot; sections. There is a choice of six &quot;stations&quot; of rhythm sounds, each containing three rhythm tracks and three fill tracks. The fill tracks can also be mixed together. Similarly, there is a choice of six lead stations, each containing three lead instruments which can be mixed. In the centre of the Mellotron, there is a tuning button that allows a variation in pitch (tempo, in the case of the rhythm tracks). Later models do not have the concept of stations and have a single knob to select a sound, along with the tuning control. However, the frame containing the tapes is designed to be removed, and replaced with one with different sounds.

Although the Mellotron was designed to reproduce the sound of the original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter) and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, to the extent that the Mellotron responds to aftertouch.

Another factor in the Mellotron&#x27;s sound is that the individual notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kilbey refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass (His refusal was based on the fact that him playing these notes on his cello would be robbing a double bassist of the session fee. When the double bassist turned up for the next session it was found to be Kilbey with a different instrument, thereby collecting a double fee for both appearances). According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains the sound of a chair being scraped in the background.

When the Chamberlin was first developed, the initial recorded sound used was that of three violins, thereby committing the instrument range to G2 to F5, being the range of the violin. Unfortunately, as with the cello, many other instruments did not conform to this range. The noted solo flute (which appears on the introduction to Strawberry Fields Forever) actually comprises recordings from an alto flute and a soprano flute, which accounts for some of the odd tuning that appears when chords are played. Other sounds such as the brass opted for a layered effect where instruments were recorded within their correct range. Others recorded more recently, such as the bass clarinet opt instead to drop the tuning on the lowest notes by pitching them electronically. The Mellotron choir was recorded in two halves: four men in one studio, and four women in another adjacent, thereby allowing for the actual recording of three sounds concurrently. In this, the male singers from the Ted Taylor Choir were allowed to drop the highest notes back to the previous octave as they were considerably out of their natural range.

The original Mellotrons were intended to be used in the home or in clubs and were not designed for touring bands. Even the later M400, which was designed to be as portable as possible, weighed over . Smoke, variations in temperature, and humidity were also detrimental to the instrument&#x27;s reliability. Moving the instrument between cold storage rooms and brightly lit stages could cause the tapes to stretch and stick on the capstan. Leslie Bradley recalls receiving some Mellotrons in for a repair &quot;looking like a blacksmith had shaped horseshoes on top&quot;. Pressing too many keys at once caused the motor to drag, resulting in the notes sounding flat. Robert Fripp stated that &quot;[t]uning a Mellotron doesn&#x27;t&quot;. Dave Kean, an expert Mellotron repairer, recommends that older Mellotrons should not be immediately used after a period of inactivity, as the tape heads can become magnetised in storage and destroy the recordings on them if played.

==History==

Although tape samplers had been explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The concept of the Mellotron originated when Chamberlin&#x27;s sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin&#x27;s Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman, and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who said they could improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon (Robinson&#x27;s son-in-law), they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.

The first model to be commercially manufactured was the Mk I in 1963. An updated version, the Mk II, was released the following year which featured the full set of sounds selectable by banks and stations. The instrument was expensive, costing £1,000 (), at a time when a typical house cost £2,000–£3,000.

Fransen failed to explain to the Bradleys that he was not the owner of the concept, and Chamberlin was unhappy with the fact that someone overseas was copying his idea. After some acrimony between the two parties, a deal was struck between them in 1966, whereby they would both continue to manufacture instruments independently. Bradmatic renamed themselves Streetly Electronics in 1970.
In 1970, the model M400 was released, which contained 35 notes (G–F) and a removable tape frame. It sold over 1,800 units. In the early 1970s, hundreds of the instruments were assembled and sold by EMI under exclusive licence. Following a financial and trademark dispute through a US distribution agreement, the Mellotron name was acquired by American-based Sound Sales. Streetly-manufactured instruments after 1976 were sold under the name Novatron. The American Mellotron distributor, Sound Sales, produced their own Mellotron model, the 4-Track, in the early 1980s. At the same time Streetly Electronics produced a road-cased version of the 400 – the T550 Novatron. By the mid-1980s, both Sound Sales and Streetly Electronics suffered severe financial setbacks, losing their market to synthesizers and solid-state electronic samplers, which rendered the Mellotron essentially obsolete. The company folded in 1986, and Les Bradley threw most of the manufacturing equipment into a skip. From 1963 until Streetly&#x27;s closure, around 2,500 units had been built.

Streetly Electronics was subsequently reactivated by Les Bradley&#x27;s son John and Martin Smith. After Les Bradley&#x27;s death in 1997, they decided to resume full-time operation as a support and refurbishment business. By 2007, the stock of available instruments to repair and restore was diminishing, so they decided to build a new model, which became the M4000. The instrument combined the features of several previous models, and featured the layout and chassis of an M400 but with a digital bank selector that emulated the mechanical original in the Mk II.

==Notable users==

The first notable musician to use the Mellotron was variety pianist Geoff Unwin, who was specifically hired by Robinson in 1962 to promote the use of the instrument. He toured with a Mk II Mellotron and made numerous appearances on television and radio. Unwin claimed that the automatic backing tracks on the Mk II&#x27;s left-hand keyboard allowed him to provide more accomplished performances than his own basic skills on the piano could provide.

The earlier 1960s Mk II units were made for the home and the characteristics of the instrument attracted a number of celebrities. Among the early Mellotron owners were Princess Margaret, Peter Sellers, King Hussein of Jordan and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard (whose Mellotron was installed in the Church of Scientology&#x27;s head UK office at Saint Hill Manor). According to Robin Douglas-Home, Princess Margaret &quot;adored it; (Lord Snowdon) positively loathed it&quot;.

After Mellotronics had targeted them as a potential customer, the BBC became interested in the possibilities of the instrument, hoping it would allow them to increase throughput at the Radiophonic Workshop. Two custom-made models loaded with sound effects were acquired in 1963, but the Radiophonic Workshop were unenthusiastic and problems with fluctuating tape speed and noise meant the sound was not up to professional broadcast quality. They ended up in the BBC FX library.
British multi-instrumentalist Graham Bond is considered the first rock musician to record with a Mellotron, beginning in 1965. The first hit song to feature a Mellotron Mk II was &quot;Baby Can It Be True&quot;, which Bond performed live with the machine in televised performances, using solenoids to trigger the tapes from his Hammond organ. Manfred Mann then included multiple Mellotron parts on their single, &quot;Ha! Ha! Said the Clown&quot;.
Mike Pinder worked at Streetly Electronics for 18 months in the early 1960s as a tester, and was immediately excited by the possibilities of the instrument. After trying piano and Hammond organ, he settled on the Mellotron as the instrument of choice for his band, the Moody Blues, purchasing a second-hand model from Fort Dunlop Working Men&#x27;s Club in Birmingham and using it extensively on every album from &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; (1967) to &quot;Octave&quot; (1978). 

Pinder says he introduced John Lennon and Paul McCartney to the Mellotron, and convinced each of them to buy one. The Beatles hired a machine and used it on their single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, recorded in various takes between November and December 1966. Author Mark Cunningham describes the part in &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; as &quot;probably the most famous Mellotron figure of all-time&quot;. Although producer George Martin was unconvinced by the instrument, describing it &quot;as if a Neanderthal piano had impregnated a primitive electronic keyboard&quot;, they continued to compose and record with various Mellotrons for the albums &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Beatles&quot; (1968, also known as &quot;the White Album&quot;). McCartney went on to use the Mellotron sporadically in his solo career.

The instrument became increasingly popular among rock and pop bands during the psychedelic era, adding what author Thom Holmes terms &quot;an eerie, unearthly sound&quot; to their recordings. Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones played a Mellotron on several of his band&#x27;s songs over 1967–68. These include &quot;We Love You&quot;, where he used the instrument to create a Moroccan-sounding horn section, &quot;She&#x27;s a Rainbow&quot;, &quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot; and &quot;Jigsaw Puzzle&quot;.
The Mellotron became a key instrument in progressive rock. King Crimson bought two Mellotrons when forming in 1969. They were aware of Pinder&#x27;s contributions to the Moody Blues and did not want to sound similar, but concluded there was no other way of generating the orchestral sound. The instrument was originally played by Ian McDonald, and subsequently by Robert Fripp upon McDonald&#x27;s departure. Later member David Cross recalled he did not particularly want to play the Mellotron, but felt that it was simply what he needed to do as a member of the band. 

Tony Banks bought a Mellotron from Fripp in 1971, which he claimed was previously used by King Crimson, to use with Genesis. He decided to approach the instrument in a different way to a typical orchestra, using block chords, and later stated that he used it in the same manner as a synth pad on later albums. His unaccompanied introduction to &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; on the album &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972), played on a Mk II with combined strings and brass, became significant enough that Streetly Electronics provided a &quot;Watcher Mix&quot; sound with the M4000. Banks claims to still have a Mellotron in storage, but does not feel inclined to use it as he generally prefers to use up-to-date technology. Barclay James Harvest&#x27;s Woolly Wolstenholme bought an M300 primarily to use for string sounds, and continued to play an M400 live into the 2000s as part of a reformed band.

Rick Wakeman played Mellotron on David Bowie&#x27;s 1969 hit song &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. Having previously found it difficult to keep in tune, Wakeman had discovered a way to do so using a special fingering technique.

The Mellotron was used extensively by German electronic band Tangerine Dream through the 1970s, on albums such as &quot;Atem&quot; (1973), &quot;Phaedra&quot; (1974), &quot;Rubycon&quot; (1975), &quot;Stratosfear&quot; (1976), and &quot;Encore&quot; (1977). In the late 1970s, French duo Space Art used a Mellotron during the recording of their second album, &quot;Trip in the Centre Head&quot;. In 1983, the band&#x27;s Christopher Franke asked Mellotronics if they could produce a digital model, as the group migrated towards using samplers.

Although the Mellotron was not extensively used in the 1980s, a number of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot;. Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into limitations of the cheap monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. He bought a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC&#x27;s Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when growing up in the 1970s, and thought it would be an interesting addition to the group&#x27;s sound. He bought a second-hand model in 1982 for £165, and first used it on the album &quot;Mummer&quot; (1983). IQ&#x27;s Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical quality or convenience.

The Mellotron resurfaced in 1995 on Oasis&#x27; album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; The instrument was played by both Noel Gallagher and Paul Arthurs on several tracks, but a particularly prominent use was the cello sound on the hit single &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, played by Arthurs. It also notably appears on their 2000 single &quot;Go Let It Out&quot;. Radiohead asked Streetly Electronics to restore and repair a model for them in 1997, and recorded with it on several tracks for their album &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997). The French electronic duo Air extensively used a M400 on their two first albums &quot;Moon Safari&quot; in 1998 and &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; in 1999.

Spock&#x27;s Beard&#x27;s Ryo Okumoto is a fan of the Mellotron, saying it characterises the sound of the band. Porcupine Tree&#x27;s Steven Wilson has acquired one of King Crimson&#x27;s old Mellotrons and, in 2013, gave a demonstration of the instrument in celebration of its 50th anniversary.

==Competitors==
Alternatives to the Mellotron were manufactured by competitors in the early to late 1970s. The Mattel Optigan was a toy keyboard designed to be used in the home, which played back sounds using optical discs. This was followed by the Vako Orchestron in 1975, which used a more professional-sounding version of the same technology. It was used by Patrick Moraz. The Birotron was a similar concept based around 8-track cartridges, used by Wakeman.

<text>Display PostScript (or DPS) is a 2D graphics engine system for computers that uses the PostScript (PS) imaging model and language (originally developed for computer printing) to generate on-screen graphics. To the basic PS system, DPS adds a number of features intended to ease working with bitmapped displays and improve performance of some common tasks.

Early versions of PostScript display systems were developed at Adobe Systems. During development of the NeXT computers, NeXT and Adobe collaborated to produce the official DPS system, which was released in 1987. NeXT used DPS throughout its history, while versions from Adobe were popular on Unix workstations for a time during the 1980s and 1990s.

== Design ==
In order to support interactive, on-screen use with reasonable performance, changes were needed:

* &quot;Multiple execution contexts&quot;: Unlike a printer environment where a PS interpreter processes one job at a time, DPS would be used in a number of windows at the same time, each with their own settings (colors, brush settings, scale, etc.). This required a modification to the system to allow it to keep several &quot;contexts&quot; (sets of state data) active, one for each process (window).
* &quot;Encoded names&quot;: Many of the procedures and data structures in PostScript are looked up by name, string identifier. In DPS these names could be replaced by integers, which are much faster for a computer to find.
* &quot;Interaction support&quot;: A number of procedures were defined to handle interaction, including hit detection.
* &quot;Halftone phase&quot;: In order to improve scrolling performance, DPS only drew the small portion of the window that became visible, shifting the rest of the image instead of re-drawing it. However this meant that the halftones might not line up, producing visible lines and boxes in the display of graphics. DPS included additional code to properly handle these cases. Modern full-color displays with no halftones have made this idea mostly obsolete.
* &quot;Incremental updates&quot;: In printing applications the PS code is interpreted until it gets a codice_1, at which point it is printed out. This is not suitable for a display situation where a large number of minor updates are needed all the time. DPS included modes to allow semi-realtime display as the instructions were received from the user programs.
* &quot;Bitmap font support&quot;: DPS added the ability to map PS fonts onto hand-drawn bitmap fonts and change from one to the other on the fly. Adobe PS&#x27;s ability to display fonts on low-resolution devices (significantly less than 300 dpi) was very poor. For example, a NeXT screen used only 96 dpi. This PS limitation was worked around by using hand-built bitmap fonts to provide passable quality. Later implementations of PS (including compatible replacements like Ghostscript) provided anti-aliased fonts on grayscale or colour displays, which significantly improved quality. However, this development was too late to be of much use. Modern displays are still around 100 dpi, but have far superior font quality without using bitmap fonts.
* &quot;Programming language support&quot;: DPS introduced the concept of a &quot;codice_2&quot;, which allowed developers to wrap PostScript code into a C-language function which could then be called from an application.

DPS did not, however, add a windowing system. That was left to the implementation to provide, and DPS was meant to be used in conjunction with an existing windowing engine. This was often the X Window System, and in this form Display PostScript was later adopted by companies such as IBM and SGI for their workstations. Often the code needed to get from an X window to a DPS context was much more complicated than the entire rest of the DPS interface. This greatly limited the popularity of DPS when any alternative was available.

== History ==

The developers of NeXT wrote a completely new windowing engine to take full advantage of NeXT&#x27;s object-oriented operating system. A number of commands were added to DPS to create the windows and to react to events, similar to but simpler than NeWS. The single API made programming at higher levels much easier and made NeXT one of the few systems to extensively use DPS. The user-space windowing system library NeXTSTEP used PostScript to draw items like titlebars and scrollers. This, in turn, made extensive use of codice_2s, which were in turn wrapped in objects and presented to the programmer in object form.

== Modern derivatives ==

Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X operating system uses a central window server (created entirely by Apple) that caches window graphics as bitmaps, instead of storing and executing PostScript code. A graphics library called Quartz 2D provides PostScript-style imaging using the PDF rendering model (a subset, plus tweaks, of the PostScript model), but this is used by application frameworks—there is no PostScript present in the Mac OS X window server. Apple chose to use this model for a variety of reasons, including the avoidance of licensing fees for DPS and more efficient support of legacy Carbon and Classic code; QuickDraw-based applications use bitmapped drawing exclusively.

<text>Bitstream Inc. was an American type foundry that produced digital typefaces. It was founded in 1981 by Matthew Carter, Mike Parker, Cherie Cone, and Rob Friedman, all former employees of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. It was located in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The font business, including MyFonts, was acquired by Monotype Imaging in March 2012. The remainder of the business, responsible for Pageflex and Bolt Browser, was spun off to a new entity named Marlborough Software Development Holdings Inc. It was later renamed Pageflex, Inc following a successful management buyout in December 2013.

==Products==

Bitstream created a library of &quot;classic&quot; fonts (usually under different names for trademark reasons) in digital form. For example, Times Ten was released as &quot;Dutch 801&quot;, Akzidenz-Grotesk as &quot;Gothic 725&quot;, Antique Olive as &quot;Incised 901&quot;, Bembo as &quot;Aldine 401&quot;, Berthold Block as &quot;Gothic 821&quot;, Bodoni Campanile as &quot;Modern 735&quot;, Choc as &quot;Staccato 555&quot;, Eurostile as &quot;Square 721&quot;, Frutiger as &quot;Humanist 777&quot;, Gill Sans as &quot;Humanist 521&quot;, Kabel as &quot;Geometric 231&quot;, Memphis as &quot;GeoSlab 703&quot;, Metro as &quot;Geometric 415&quot;, Optima as &quot;Zapf Humanist&quot;, Oscar as &quot;Formal 436&quot;, Peignot as &quot;Exotic 350&quot;, Plantin as &quot;Aldine 721&quot;, Profil as &quot;Decorated 035&quot;, Syntax as &quot;Humanist 531&quot;, Torino as &quot;Industrial 736&quot; and Univers as &quot;Zurich&quot;. The Bitstream font collection is most widely used through its inclusion with the CorelDRAW software, as well as other Corel products such as WordPerfect Office.

The company received extensive criticism for its strategy of cheaply offering digitisations of pre-existing typefaces that it had not designed. While technically not illegal, font designer John Hudson would describe its selling of large numbers of typefaces on CD at discount prices as &quot;one of the worst instances of piracy in the history of type&quot;.

Bitstream developed a number of fonts on its own, such as Charter, by Matthew Carter, Iowan Old Style by John Downer and the freeware Bitstream Vera family of fonts.

One of their best known fonts is Swiss 721 BT, which is a Helvetica clone with condensed versions and a rounded version. It was among the first digitally available Swiss family typefaces, being designed for that purpose in 1982.

Another Bitstream product is Font Fusion, a font rasterizing engine developed jointly with Type Solutions, Inc., which was later owned entirely by Bitstream.

The multi-byte character set was named Bitstream International Character Set (BICS).

== History ==
The company had a high level of involvement in BeOS, with older BeOS releases using a Bitstream renderer, and the latest development releases from 2001 using Font Fusion. The OS, including its freeware releases, included a large number of Bitstream fonts, including their clones of Times New Roman, Helvetica and Courier.

On December 2, 1998, Bitstream Inc. announced acquisition of all outstanding stock of Type Solutions, Inc. In addition, Sampo Kaasila, its founder and president and the creator of TrueType, agreed to join Bitstream&#x27;s team as Director of Research and Development.

In March 2000, Bitstream launched MyFonts, an open marketplace offering fonts from various foundries.

In January 2009, Bitstream introduced the BOLT Browser, a Java ME-based Web browser for mobile phones. It was distributed free of charge to consumers and was built using the company&#x27;s ThunderHawk mobile Web browsing technology for mobile network operators and handset manufacturers. The product was discontinued by the end of 2011.

<doc id="61020" wikidata="Q187165" url="?curid=61020" title="Dave Mustaine">
<text>David Scott Mustaine (born September 13, 1961) is an American musician. He is best known as the co-founder, frontman, primary songwriter and sole consistent member of the thrash metal band Megadeth and for his time as the lead guitarist of Metallica. Mustaine has released sixteen studio albums with Megadeth, sold over 50 million records worldwide, with six albums platinum-certified, and won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2017 at the 59th Grammy Awards, for the title track of their fifteenth studio album, &quot;Dystopia&quot;.

Prior to forming Megadeth, Mustaine was the lead guitarist of Metallica but did not appear on any albums. He was, however, credited as a writer on four songs from &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; and two songs from &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;. Mustaine was born into a family of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. He now identifies as a born-again Christian. Mustaine has been to rehab throughout his life, fighting alcohol and drug problems, and briefly battled throat cancer in 2019. Mustaine has been married to Pamela Anne Casselberry since 1991, with whom he has two children, Electra and Justis Mustaine.

In a popular vote on the internet forum of &quot;Ultimate Guitar&quot;, Mustaine was ranked third in the top 25 rhythm guitarists of all time, first in Joel McIver&#x27;s book &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot;, tenth in &quot;Loudwire&#x27;s&quot; &quot;66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot;, and third in their &quot;10 Greatest Rhythm Guitarists in Rock + Metal&quot;.
== Early life ==

Mustaine was born on September 13, 1961, in La Mesa, California, (a nearby suburb of San Diego) to parents Emily Marie (&quot;née&quot; David) and John Jefferson Mustaine. His father was of French, German, Irish, and Finnish descent, while his mother was of German Jewish ancestry. The Mustaine family were Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

Mustaine had three older sisters, Michelle, Suzanne, and Debbie, who were 18, 15, and 3 respectively when he was born. Due to the significant age difference between Mustaine and his sisters, as a child he often thought of them as his aunts rather than sisters. Mustaine has described family life as tumultuous during his early life, lamenting years later that &quot;life unraveled in a great many ways&quot; for his family before he was born. Mustaine has described his father as &quot;a very smart and successful man, good with his hands and head&quot; who was a branch manager for Bank of America before moving to NCR, where the corporation&#x27;s transition from mechanical to electrical technology ultimately made him expendable and cost him his job. A longtime problem drinker, John Mustaine&#x27;s issues with alcohol only grew worse from then on, and he left his four-year-old son permanently after Emily divorced him in 1965.

==Early career==
===Panic===
Panic was Mustaine&#x27;s first band. The initial lineup was Dave Harmon on drums, Tom Quecke on guitar, Bob Evans on bass and Pat Voelkes as the singer, with Mustaine on lead guitar. The first gig, played at Dana Point, featured Mike Leftwych as a substitute drummer. Leftwych and a sound man were killed in a car crash after the show. Mustaine stated that after the band started to fall apart in 1981, Quecke was also killed in a separate car crash shortly after.

The first song that Mustaine ever wrote was Jump in the Fire. Panic songs that Mustaine went on to reuse for Megadeth include N2RHQ (renamed Hangar 18), Child Saint (renamed Rust in Peace... Polaris) and Mechanix. Cover songs that Panic played included Nature&#x27;s Child by Triumph and This Planet&#x27;s on Fire (Burn in Hell) by Sammy Hagar.

===Metallica===

In 1981, Mustaine disbanded Panic and joined Metallica as the lead guitarist. Metallica&#x27;s drummer Lars Ulrich had posted an ad in a local newspaper, &quot;The Recycler&quot;, looking for a lead guitarist. In his own words, Mustaine remembers his first meeting with James Hetfield and Ulrich: &quot;I was in the room warming up and I walked out and asked, &#x27;Well, am I gonna audition or what?&#x27;, and they said, &#x27;No, you&#x27;ve got the job.&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it had been and suggested that we get some beer to celebrate.&quot;

Metallica began recording their first album titled &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; in 1983 but Mustaine&#x27;s tenure with Metallica was short-lived. Brian Slagel, owner of Metal Blade Records, recalled in an interview: &quot;Dave was an incredibly talented guy but he also had an incredibly large problem with alcohol and drugs. He&#x27;d get wasted and become a real crazy person, a raging megalomaniac, and the other guys just couldn&#x27;t deal with that after a while. I mean, they all drank of course, but Dave drank more… much more. I could see they were beginning to get fed up of seeing Dave drunk out of his mind all the time.&quot;

On one occasion, Mustaine brought his dog to rehearsal; the dog jumped onto the car of Metallica bassist Ron McGovney and scratched the paint. Hetfield allegedly yelled at Mustaine&#x27;s dog and kicked it in a fit of rage, which provoked Mustaine into physically attacking Hetfield. Mustaine was fired following the altercation, but the next day, Mustaine asked to be allowed back in the band and was granted his request. Another incident occurred when Mustaine, who had been drinking, poured a can of beer down the neck and into the pick-ups of McGovney&#x27;s bass, resulting in collateral damage. McGovney claimed that he was unaware of the damage and that he received an electric shock upon plugging it into an amplifier.

On April 11, 1983, after Metallica had driven to New York to record their debut album, Mustaine was officially ejected from the band because of his alcoholism, drug abuse, overly aggressive behavior, and personal clashes with founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, an incident Mustaine refers to as &quot;no warning, no second chance&quot;. The band packed up Mustaine&#x27;s gear, drove him to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and put him on a Greyhound bus bound for Los Angeles. On this bus ride Mustaine scribbled some lyrical ideas on the back of a hand bill, which later became the song &quot;Set the World Afire&quot; from the 1988 Megadeth album &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot;

During his time in Metallica, Mustaine toured with the band, co-wrote four songs that appeared on &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All,&quot; and co-wrote two songs that eventually appeared on the 1984 album &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;. Mustaine has also made unverified claims to have written parts of &quot;Leper Messiah&quot; from &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;.

===Fallen Angels===
Fallen Angels was the name of the short-lived band that Mustaine founded after his departure from Metallica. In April 1983, after returning to California to live with his mother, he landed what he calls his first real job with the aid of Robbie McKinney. McKinney and a friend, Matt Kisselstein, worked with Mustaine as telemarketers. Mustaine quit his job after earning enough money to move to an apartment in Hollywood, and recruited McKinney, who played guitar, and Kisselstein, who played bass, for his band Fallen Angels. In his biography, Mustaine describes that &quot;We lacked the chemistry, the energy, the spark—or whatever you want to call it—that gives a band life in its infancy.&quot; The partnership did not last.

This paved the way for his partnership with Dave Ellefson and Greg Handevidt. Ellefson was playing the opening bass line of Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Runnin&#x27; with the Devil&quot; in the apartment below Mustaine&#x27;s. After stomping on the floor and shouting for them to stop, Mustaine, being hung over at the time, took a potted plant and threw it out of his window and hit the air conditioner of the apartment below. This resulted in the two coming up to Mustaine&#x27;s apartment to ask for cigarettes. Mustaine replied &quot;There&#x27;s a store on the corner&quot; and slammed the door in their faces. A few minutes later, they knocked on the door, this time asking if they could buy him beer. Mustaine&#x27;s reply: &#x27;OK, now you are talking&#x27;. They spent the night talking about music, and soon after, Mustaine, Ellefson and Handevidt were bandmates.

With little confidence in his own vocal capabilities, Mustaine added &#x27;Lor&#x27; Kane to the Fallen Angels roster. Kane did not stay long, although he is credited for the suggestion that they should change the name to Megadeth, knowing that Mustaine had written a song of the same name. After Kane left, the first of many drummers, Dijon Carruthers, joined the band. The lineup of Mustaine, Ellefson, Handevidt, and Carruthers was one of the first incarnations of Megadeth.

==Megadeth==
===1980s===
Following unsuccessful vocalist auditions, Mustaine took on vocal duties himself at Megadeth&#x27;s first rehearsal in addition to playing lead and rhythm guitar. In 1984, Megadeth produced a three-song demo with drummer Lee Rauch, who replaced Carruthers after Mustaine and Ellefson decided they could not trust him. Carruthers had chosen to hide his black heritage from them by claiming he was Spanish, and they could not understand why he would deceive them. Kerry King joined the band for a few shows; however, he opted to leave Megadeth after less than a week so he could continue working on his own band, Slayer. Jazz-influenced drummer Gar Samuelson replaced Rauch, who left after Mustaine convinced him to play with a broken foot. Megadeth recorded a demo as a three-piece band, which captured the attention of guitarist Chris Poland, also a jazz player and a friend of Samuelson, who subsequently joined the band. In November, the band signed a deal with Combat Records and began touring.

In June 1985, Megadeth released their first album, &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot;, via Combat Records. That summer, the band toured the U.S. and Canada with Exciter. Guitarist Mike Albert replaced Chris Poland when he was incarcerated for possession of heroin. After Poland was released, he rejoined the band in October and the band then began recording their second studio album for Combat. On New Year&#x27;s Eve of that year, Megadeth played in San Francisco with Exodus and Metal Church. Metallica was the headliner. This was the only time Megadeth and Metallica were on the same card, until 1991.

In 1986, a year after releasing their debut album, Mustaine approached Jackson Guitars for a custom-built guitar. Jackson modified their existing Jackson King V model for Mustaine by adding two more frets to the standard 22 fret King V. In the 1990s, the company began mass-producing a Dave Mustaine signature series Jackson King V, which continued into the early 2000s.

The following year, major label Capitol Records signed Megadeth and obtained the rights to their second studio album, &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; Megadeth opened a U.S. tour with King Diamond and Motörhead. &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;, released on September 19, 1986, is often regarded as a thrash metal classic, producing the notable title track (the opening bass lick of which was used by MTV News segments) as well as the thrash anthem &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot;.

In February 1987, Megadeth opened for Alice Cooper on his &quot;Constrictor&quot; tour. The band also toured with King Diamond whose previous band, Mercyful Fate, were a huge influence on Megadeth. In March, Megadeth&#x27;s first world tour began in the U.K. Mustaine and Ellefson guested on the band Malice&#x27;s &quot;License to Kill&quot; album. Megadeth re-recorded &quot;These Boots&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Dudes&quot;, and that summer went on tour with Overkill and Necros. Amid drug problems and suspicions of stealing the band&#x27;s equipment and pawning it for drug money, Mustaine fired Poland and Samuelson after their last show in Hawaii.

Chuck Behler, who had been Samuelson&#x27;s drum tech, became Megadeth&#x27;s new drummer with guitarist Jeff Young replacing Poland. Megadeth released their third studio album, &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot;, in January 1988. The album contains the song &quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot;, which, according to the liner notes of &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot;, was composed after the death of Metallica&#x27;s bass player Cliff Burton. &quot;Hook in Mouth&quot; attacked the Parents Music Resource Center with gusto, although their cover of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;, despite a guest appearance from ex-Pistol Steve Jones, was ill-advised in the eyes of &quot;Allmusic&#x27;s&quot; critic.

Later that year, Megadeth opened for Dio and then Iron Maiden on tour before playing the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in the U.K. with Kiss, Iron Maiden, Guns N&#x27; Roses, David Lee Roth, and Helloween. Shortly after, Mustaine fired Behler and Young, accusing Young of having thoughts of a relationship with Mustaine&#x27;s then-girlfriend. Around this period, Mustaine produced the debut album from Seattle thrash band Sanctuary, called &quot;Refuge Denied.&quot;

Nick Menza, who was Chuck Behler&#x27;s drum tech, joined Megadeth in 1989, and the band recorded their only track ever as a three-piece: a cover of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; for the horror film &quot;Shocker.&quot; Film director Penelope Spheeris would later recount in the Megadeth episode of &quot;Behind the Music&quot; that Mustaine showed up to the video shoot so fried on heroin and other drugs that he could not sing and play guitar at the same time; therefore, the singing and playing had to be recorded separately. Mustaine was arrested for &quot;impaired driving&quot; that March with seven or more drugs in his system and was forced by authorities to enter a rehabilitation program (the first of his 15 visits to rehabilitation centers).

===1990s===
Following Cacophony&#x27;s disbanding in 1989, Marty Friedman was auditioned the same year to fill in the vacant lead-guitar position, and joined the band in February 1990. In September of that year, the band joined the &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; tour overseas with Slayer, Suicidal Tendencies, and Testament. The tour began one month before Megadeth released &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; (1990), which was cited as one of the best thrash metal records of all time by publications such as &quot;Decibel&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and continued their commercial success. They then went back on the road to promote the new album, this time as support for Judas Priest.

Megadeth started off 1991 by performing for an audience of 145,000 people at Rock in Rio before starting their own world tour with Alice in Chains as their special guest. Mustaine was married in April, the same month the &quot;Rusted Pieces&quot; home video was released. That summer, the Clash of the Titans tour hit the U.S., featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains taking the opening slot. Later that year, the Megadeth song &quot;Go to Hell&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;.

Also in 1991, Mustaine collaborated with Sean Harris from Diamond Head on the track &quot;Crown of Worms&quot;. Mustaine would later appear on Diamond Head&#x27;s reformation album &quot;Death and Progress&quot;. Mustaine&#x27;s wife, Pamela, gave birth to their son Justis in 1992. July of that year saw the release of Megadeth&#x27;s most commercially successful record: &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, which debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and boasted some of the band&#x27;s most commercially successful songs, including &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; and &quot;Skin o&#x27; My Teeth&quot;. The original version of the &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot; video was edited due to its depiction of a political leader being assassinated; &quot;Skin o&#x27; My Teeth&quot; was aired on MTV with a disclaimer from Mustaine insisting that the song did not endorse suicide. Ellefson contributed lyrics to the family-farm ballad &quot;Foreclosure of a Dream&quot;, and Menza wrote the lyrics about canned hunting for the title track.

Pantera and Suicidal Tendencies opened for Megadeth on the &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; tour, and MTV News also invited Mustaine to cover the Democratic National Convention for them that summer. In November, the &quot;Exposure of a Dream&quot; home video was released. In 1993, Mustaine guested on a new album by one of the bands who had influenced his own sound: Diamond Head, and also began a U.S. tour with Stone Temple Pilots as their opening act. The tour with Stone Temple Pilots which included a planned appearance at Budokan, was ultimately canceled due to Mustaine&#x27;s continuing struggles with addiction. In June, Megadeth played Milton Keynes Bowl with Diamond Head and Metallica and later opened for Metallica on a handful of European Stadium dates. Megadeth was kicked off Aerosmith&#x27;s U.S. tour after just seven dates because a comment made by Mustaine (&quot;We don&#x27;t have much time to play because Aerosmith don&#x27;t have much time left to live&quot;) was deemed extraordinarily offensive to Aerosmith. &quot;Angry Again&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the 1993 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, while &quot;99 Ways To Die&quot; was featured on &quot;The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience&quot; compilation album.

Megadeth spent the majority of 1994 making &quot;Youthanasia,&quot; a more commercial album that had high expectations due to the success of &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;. The band covered Black Sabbath&#x27;s song &quot;Paranoid&quot; for &quot;Nativity in Black: A Tribute to Black Sabbath&quot; and performed on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Megadeth&quot; in celebration of the Halloween release of their new album. The release of Youthanasia was also followed by a brief South American tour to promote the album.

Another soundtrack appearance, &quot;Diadems&quot; on &quot;Tales from the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight&quot;, kicked off 1995. Megadeth spent the first two months of the year on the &quot;Youthanasia&quot; tour with Corrosion of Conformity in tow. In March, the &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; compilation hit European stores. The &quot;Evolver: The Making of Youthanasia&quot; home video followed in May, and &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; made it to the U.S. and Japan in July, just in time for the start of the &quot;Reckoning Day&quot; tour with special guests Flotsam and Jetsam, Korn and Fear Factory. In September the band performed at the &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; festival in South America, Peru.

A Grammy nomination for &quot;Paranoid&quot; began 1996 for Megadeth. Enlisting Fear singer Lee Ving, Mustaine released the album &quot;The Craving&quot; under the moniker &quot;MD.45&quot; with Suicidal Tendencies drummer Jimmy DeGrasso and Goldfinger bassist Kelly LeMieux. In September, Megadeth returned to the studio, this time in Nashville, Tennessee, to record &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;.

&quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; (1997) included thrashing songs like &quot;Vortex&quot; and &quot;FFF&quot;, which were reminiscent of Megadeth&#x27;s older material, alongside radio-friendly fare like &quot;Trust&quot;, which reached the 5th spot on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock charts. In June, Misfits opened for the band on tour. Chaos Comics released &quot;The Cryptic Writings of Megadeth&quot; comic books in August, and a remix of &quot;Almost Honest&quot; showed up on the &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; soundtrack.

Mustaine&#x27;s daughter, Electra Mustaine, was born on January 28, 1998, the same month that &quot;Trust&quot; was nominated for a Grammy. Megadeth played on the Howard Stern Show and that summer took part in Ozzfest. Two days after Nick Menza had undergone surgery for a benign knee tumor, he received a call from Mustaine informing him that his services would no longer be needed. Jimmy DeGrasso, who Mustaine had played with previously in MD.45, fulfilled Menza&#x27;s duties. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Megadeth opened for Black Sabbath at Chase Field alongside Soulfly, Slayer, and Pantera.

While touring after &quot;Cryptic Writings,&quot; Mustaine told interviewers that songs like &quot;She-Wolf&quot; and &quot;Vortex&quot; had reinvigorated his love for classic music by bands like Iron Maiden and Motörhead, and that he intended to write an album that was &quot;1/2 Peace Sells, 1/2 Cryptic Writings&quot;; however, after hearing about a comment that Lars Ulrich had made in the press in which he said he wished Mustaine would take more &quot;risks&quot;, intentions changed. Managers and producers had more input. The song &quot;Crush &#x27;Em&quot; was written with the express purpose of being played in wrestling arenas. In later years, Mustaine would blame much of this period on Friedman&#x27;s desire to go in a more &quot;pop&quot; direction. Recorded with producer Dann Huff, again in Nashville, &quot;Risk&quot; was released on August 31, 1999. &quot;Crush &#x27;Em&quot; made it onto the &quot;Universal Soldier: The Return&quot; soundtrack and into WCW wrestling events (notably played live on Monday Nitro). In July, the band covered &quot;Never Say Die&quot; for a second Black Sabbath tribute. They closed the Woodstock &#x27;99 music festival and again opened for Iron Maiden in Europe. The year ended with Marty Friedman announcing his departure from the band.

=== 2000s ===

As the tour behind &quot;Risk&quot; soldiered on, Al Pitrelli replaced Friedman on the road. In April, the new lineup entered the studio to begin work on a new album a couple of months before they officially parted ways with Capitol Records. The summer was spent on the road with Anthrax and Mötley Crüe. Capitol released a compilation album in the fall, &quot;Capitol Punishment: The Megadeth Years&quot;, featuring two brand new (and more metal-leaning) songs, &quot;Dread and the Fugitive Mind&quot; was one of the brand new songs and appeared on the next studio album the following year. With a new deal in place with Sanctuary Records, Megadeth returned to the studio toward the end of the year to finish their album and on New Year&#x27;s Eve, played a show in Anchorage, Alaska.

An acoustic tour sponsored by radio stations, a press tour, and a video shoot for the song &quot;Moto Psycho&quot; all preceded the May 2001 release of &quot;The World Needs A Hero.&quot; The summer was filled with festival appearances supporting AC/DC. In September, Megadeth set out across North America with Endo and Iced Earth. VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; special on Megadeth aired that year and was later released on DVD. At the end of the year, the band filmed two shows in Arizona, which were released as the 2CD and DVD &quot;Rude Awakening.&quot; The early part of 2002 saw the release of a remixed and re-mastered &quot;Killing Is My Business...&quot; with bonus tracks and expanded packaging, followed by &quot;Rude Awakening&quot;.

In January 2002, Mustaine was admitted to the hospital to have a kidney stone removed. While undergoing treatment, he was administered pain medication that triggered a relapse. Following his hospital stay, he immediately checked himself into a treatment center in Texas. While at rehab, Mustaine suffered an injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, also known as Saturday Night Palsy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.

On April 3, 2002, Mustaine announced in a press release that he was disbanding Megadeth, officially due to his arm injury. For the next four months, Mustaine underwent intense physical therapy five days a week. Slowly, Mustaine began to play again, but was forced to &quot;re-teach&quot; his left hand.

Mustaine himself gave what he called &quot;the Reader&#x27;s Digest version&quot; of the whole matter during an interview for SuicideGirls: &quot;I went into retirement because my arm got hurt really bad. I broke up the band which at the time was Al Pitrelli, Dave Ellefson, Jimmy DeGrasso, and myself. I was having problems with Al because he liked to drink, and we didn&#x27;t want to show up at places with him drunk. Al also got married to a nice woman, but he wanted to spend time with her. After a few years, most married men are willing to die, so I figured if we got a couple years into the marriage that might have changed. But the fact was, Al wasn&#x27;t fitting. DeGrasso was really hard to be around because he was so negative all the time with his complaining about money and wanting things. Ellefson was all about &#x27;play my songs, play my songs.&#x27; I hated being around these guys so when the arm injury happened, it was a welcome relief and an indication that I had to stop.&quot; Mustaine went through physical therapy for his arm injury. During his recovery, he explored other areas of the music industry, including production. Contrary to what doctors had predicted, within a short time he fully recovered. However, all was mostly quiet on the Megadeth front for the better part of 2003. Mustaine left Jackson guitars, did a solo acoustic performance at a benefit show, unveiled his new ESP model at the NAMM convention, and oversaw the release of &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; as an audio DVD presented in Dolby 5.1 surround sound.

At the same time, Mustaine&#x27;s personal life once again underwent changes. It was during this period that Mustaine became a Christian. He expressed his intent to withdraw from a show in Greece that had Rotting Christ and Dissection opening for Megadeth. Mustaine told &quot;The Daily Times&quot; during a recent interview, his own world was already shattered, and becoming a Christian was the one way he&#x27;s found to put the pieces back together. &quot;I went back to being a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with that.&quot; He later said in an interview, &quot;Looking up at the cross, I said six simple words, &#x27;What have I got to lose?&#x27; Afterwards my whole life has changed. It&#x27;s been hard, but I wouldn&#x27;t change it for anything. Rather go my whole life believing that there is a God and find out there isn&#x27;t than live my whole life thinking there isn&#x27;t a God and then find out, when I die, that there is.&quot; Mustaine also considers his talent a gift from God. &quot;To be the No. 1 rated guitar player in the world is a gift from God and I&#x27;m stoked about it, but I think Chris is better than I am, anyway,&quot; he said. &quot;Either way, I don&#x27;t put too much earthly merit on it.&quot;

In 2004 Mustaine oversaw the remixing and re-mastering of Megadeth&#x27;s entire Capitol Records catalog. All albums were re-released with bonus tracks and full liner notes. With one album remaining in his contract to Sanctuary Records, Mustaine began recording what he intended to be his first solo album with drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and bassist Jimmy Sloas. Complete with guest solos from old friend Chris Poland, this project became a new Megadeth album, &quot;The System Has Failed,&quot; released on September 14, 2004. One month before, Mustaine announced a new touring lineup for Megadeth: Glen Drover (King Diamond/Eidolon) and James MacDonough (Iced Earth). Nick Menza had briefly been a part of the new band before differences once again caused his departure. One week before a new US tour with Exodus supporting, new drummer (and Glen&#x27;s brother) Shawn Drover (Eidolon) joined Megadeth.

The &quot;Blackmail The Universe&quot; tour started in February 2005 with Diamond Head and Dungeon supporting. Capitol released a new greatest hits, &quot;Back to the Start,&quot; in June, a month before Mustaine created &quot;Gigantour&quot; with Dream Theater, Anthrax, Fear Factory, Symphony X, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Life of Agony, and more. During 2005 Gigantour Mustaine brought a &quot;spiritual counselor&quot; to help him avoid the problems that almost cost him his life due to his prior drug addictions. The Dillinger Escape Plan frontman Greg Puciato stated: &quot;He had a pastor walking around with him on tour and riding on his bus, I think to help keep him on the straight and narrow path.&quot;

&quot;Arsenal of Megadeth&quot;, a two-disc anthology DVD, was released on March 21, 2006. Bass player James LoMenzo (Black Label Society, White Lion) replaced James MacDonough in February shortly before the band headed to the Dubai Desert Rock Festival in the United Arab Emirates. On April 19, the band began recording a new album, &quot;United Abominations,&quot; at SARM studios in the UK (David Gilmour&#x27;s house), they announced a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records in May 2006. &quot;United Abominations&quot; was released worldwide on May 15, 2007. However, the album had already been leaked before its release. On January 13, 2008, Dave Mustaine confirmed that guitarist Glen Drover had quit Megadeth to focus on his family and that he had been replaced by Chris Broderick of Jag Panzer. The new lineup made its live debut in Finland on February 4 and returned to the US for Gigantour 2008 in the spring. The band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Endgame&quot;, was released on September 15, 2009.

Mustaine planned to open Megadeth&#x27;s California recording studio to under-privileged children to teach them about rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. The band owns a building in San Diego, California, which has housed their recording equipment over the years. In an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Mustaine wanted to make better use of the studio by turning the space into a learning center for children who come from under-privileged backgrounds. He also said he vowed to teach them how to play instruments.

===2010s===

In 2010, longtime bassist David Ellefson rejoined Megadeth eight years after its disbanding in 2002. Ellefson and Mustaine agreed to keep any unresolved issues in the past and to work on building and maintaining their friendship again. Ellefson has since said that he feels that &quot;having that time away created a realization for both of us that while we are both productive individually, Megadeth is definitely stronger with both of us in it together.&quot; Megadeth embarked on a &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; 20th-anniversary tour, playing the album in its entirety, along with fan favorites such as &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot;, &quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot; and &quot;Skin O&#x27; My Teeth&quot;.

On June 16, &quot;The Big Four&quot; thrash metal bands (Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer) shared the stage in Warsaw, Poland. The event happened in various other countries like Switzerland, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, the United States, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Sweden and ended at the Yankee Stadium of New York City on September 14, 2011. &quot;The Big Four&quot; show in Sofia, Bulgaria was recorded and released on Blu-ray and DVD. In 2016, Mustaine expressed interest in doing more Big 4 shows, although this is unlikely due to the breakup of Slayer.

On August 3, 2010, Mustaine released his autobiography in the United States, titled &quot;Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir&quot;. The book covers Mustaine&#x27;s life from childhood until the release of the 2009 Megadeth album &quot;Endgame&quot;. The book was released in the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand under the title &quot;Mustaine: A Life in Metal&quot;. In December 2011, Mustaine appeared at Metallica&#x27;s 30th-anniversary celebration at the Fillmore Theater and performed five songs from Metallica&#x27;s debut album. On October 4, 2014, Mustaine&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s-afflicted mother-in-law went missing from a campground. Her remains were discovered on November 26.

Following the release of Megadeth&#x27;s 14th studio album, &quot;Super Collider&quot; in 2013, Megadeth began working on their next album, &quot;Dystopia&quot; in 2015. David Ellefson commented that work would commence &quot;after the first [day] of the year&quot;. Lineup changes included the departure of lead guitarist Chris Broderick and drummer Shawn Drover, both of whom departed the band in late November 2014, both citing creative differences. Chris Adler of Lamb of God was announced in March 2015 to replace Drover, and Kiko Loureiro of Angra replaced Broderick on lead guitar.

At the end of March, Mustaine announced via Twitter that he was &quot;almost done with the writing&quot;, and that recording would begin next week. Megadeth finished recording the album in July of that year, with the track listing was also revealed in a meeting between Mustaine and Megadeth&#x27;s official fan club, the Cyber Army. Mustaine commented in an interview in June that fans are &quot;gonna be happy&quot;, because the album is &quot;really aggressive again&quot;, and that nothing in the record was too out of the ordinary, apart from small changes in Mustaine&#x27;s playing due to his brief tenure with the San Diego Symphony. The first single from the new album, &quot;Fatal Illusion&quot;, was released on October the 1st, which was followed by the release of the title of the album and its release date via Twitter on October the 2nd. The Dystopia World Tour was announced in support of the album, with Children of Bodom, Suicidal Tendencies, and Havok as supporting acts. The next two singles, &quot;The Threat Is Real&quot; and &quot;Dystopia&quot;, were released on November 25 and January 7, 2016, respectively.

The album was released on January 22, 2016, and debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200, Megadeth&#x27;s second-highest-charting album since 1992&#x27;s &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;. The album was met with generally positive acclaim, with Chad Bowar of Loudwire, calling &quot;Dystopia&quot; a &quot;first-rate Megadeth album, however Slant Magazine&#x27;s Benjamin Aspray criticizing the lackluster solos, saying that they &quot;rarely leave much of a mark&quot;, and commenting that Mustaine&#x27;s voice has &quot;never sounded so guttural or monotone&quot;. Other critics noted the album&#x27;s recurrent political themes and commentary on current affairs.

The title track of &quot;Dystopia&quot; winning the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017 would start Megadeth&#x27;s year. The band would begin touring again, with Megadeth closing that year&#x27;s edition of Jakarta&#x27;s Hammersonic Festival in May. Prior to touring, Mustaine also held a &quot;Megadeth Boot Camp&quot; in March, where fans would be invited to his home in Fallbrook, California. The bootcamp included lessons on guitar, bass and drums, alongside wine-tasting and a jam session to their 1992 hit &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;.

In June in an interview with WRIF&#x27;s Mark &quot;Meltdown&quot; Milligan, Mustaine commented that work on the followup to &quot;Dystopia&quot; would begin soon, with recording to start around &quot;November, December of this year&quot;.

The band would embark on several European shows in August, with Megadeth headlining the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany alongside Volbeat, Accept, and Alice Cooper. They would also headline that years Lokerse Feesten in Belgium, alongside Marilyn Manson and Alice Cooper. Megadeth also performed at that year&#x27;s Summer Breeze Open Air festival, where Nuclear Blast celebrated their label&#x27;s 30th anniversary, with the band co-headlining with Korn, Amon Amarth, Kreator and Heaven Shall Burn. Next was an appearance at the Bloodstock Open Air in Walton-on-Trent, co-headlining with Ghost and Amon Amarth. They would finish August with an appearance headlining the Elbriot festival in Hamburg, alongside Trivium and Hatebreed. Following this, Megadeth would tour North America in September alongside Scorpions on their &quot;Crazy World Tour&quot;, named after the latter band&#x27;s 1990 LP.

In November, Mustaine joined the DJ roster for Gimme Radio, promoting his involvement with Megadeth as well as his favorite music and playlists on &quot;The Dave Mustaine Show&quot;.

==Gigantour==
In the summer of 2005, Mustaine launched a travelling North American metal festival. He named it Gigantour after a favorite childhood cartoon of his, Gigantor. It spanned six weeks and was co-headlined by Megadeth and Dream Theater, with a variety of other supporting metal acts such as Fear Factory and the Dillinger Escape Plan. Mustaine has been quoted as saying that his main intention when conceiving the tour was to bring the American metal audiences an eclectic and affordable alternative to Ozzfest.

The second annual Gigantour began in September 2006 and was composed of Megadeth, Lamb of God, Opeth, and Arch Enemy. The second stage bands were Overkill, Into Eternity, Sanctity, and the SmashUp.

The 2007 Gigantour featured Bring Me the Horizon, Static-X, DevilDriver, and Lacuna Coil along with Megadeth. Megadeth appeared on their first tour to Bangalore, India in March 2008.

The 2008 installment of the tour featured Megadeth, Children of Bodom, In Flames, High on Fire, and Job for a Cowboy (and Evile for the UK and Scandinavia tour).

Megadeth &quot;Blood in the Water: Live in San Diego&quot; (from the Gigantour 2008) premiered on HDNet Sunday November 2 at 8 p.m. in high definition and 5.1 audio (Repeats check www.hd.net)

In November 2011, it was announced the Gigantour would start up again. The lineup consisted of Megadeth, Motörhead, Volbeat, and Lacuna Coil. The tour kicked off at the Susquehanna Bank Center in Camden, New Jersey on January 26, 2012.

==Equipment==
As of 2021, Dave Mustaine uses Gibson guitars. The Dave Mustaine Collection was launched February 2021 in partnership with Gibson, and will span acoustic and electric guitars across the Gibson, Epiphone, and Kramer ranges.

Mustaine used B.C. Rich guitars early in his career (and for his entire duration with Metallica), most notably a B.C. Rich Bich 10 string with just the regular six strings. First the guitar started in a natural finish, but Mustaine painted it black around the time &#x27;Peace Sells&#x27; was released. In 1987, he switched to Jackson Guitars. In March 2009, while he was guest hosting Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s Friday night radio show, Mustaine attributed his choice of the Flying V guitar to being a fan of UFO&#x27;s Michael Schenker when he was growing up.

After switching to Jackson Guitars he helped to re-design the guitar maker&#x27;s version of the King V model (at the time, it was a &quot;double Rhoads size&quot; meaning it had two of the longer fins from the RR). The reshaped Mustaine KV1 model had slightly shorter fins, Kahler bridge and Seymour Duncan TB-5 bridge and SH-4 neck pickups. He also specified 24 frets rather than the original King V&#x27;s 22, a tradition that Jackson still keeps on its King V models today, and the KV1, as have all of Mustaine&#x27;s signature models, also featured a smaller, medium fretwire compared to the extra jumbos featured on most Jacksons.

Mustaine later switched to ESP Guitars. The company released the DV8 signature model in the 2004 NAMM convention also at which time Mustaine announced his ESP endorsement deal. In 2005, Mustaine and ESP teamed up to release the ESP Axxion, (pronounced Action), in order to celebrate Megadeth&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The ESP Axxion and ESP DV8 were both successful and cheaper models such as the LTD-DV8 R, LTD DV200 and the LTD Axxion were released to target a bigger market.

However, on December 6, 2006, Mustaine announced that he was leaving ESP and shifting his endorsement to Dean Guitars. His new signature guitar was revealed during NAMM Show on January 19, 2007. The signature guitar is called the Dean VMNT. The V-shaped guitar is very similar to his earlier Jackson and ESP Signature models. The release campaign of the VMNT had a limited copy of only 150 in the world and are signed by Mustaine.

&quot;After two successful years, I have decided to leave ESP guitars. This was a business decision and had nothing to do with the guitars or the manufacturing of the guitars, and I wish the staff of ESP, both in the USA and in Japan and Korea the very best of health and prosperity. Meanwhile, I am taking my Classic Metal V known formerly as a Jackson King V1 or an ESP DV8, and my new guitar design presently known as an Axxion, which was the recipient of the Gold Award from Guitar World Magazine for 2005 for new guitar designs with me. I will also be re-introducing through my new endorsement many special models, including re-issues of my old models from over the span of my career, as well as some retro V shapes, similar to the formerly known Jackson Y2KV or a Gibson Flying V. I will make my announcement and be attending the 2007 NAMM show to meet Megadeth fans and all metal fans, musicians of all styles-especially guitarists.&quot;

Until 2021 he used his signature models by made by Dean Guitars, the Dean VMNT and Zero. The US models were available briefly in limited run after release, although the Korean and Chinese models are in continuous production. Mustaine used the US and Korean models on stage.

In February 2021, Mustaine announced that he was leaving Dean Guitars and shifting his endorsement to Gibson.

Mustaine has also recently collaborated with Marshall Amplification in order to produce the 1960DM Dave Mustaine Signature Cabinets. He is now using his signature Marshall cabinets on tour.

Mustaine endorses Seymour Duncan and has his own Signature Live Wire pickups and uses Cleartone strings (.011 – .054 for D tuning, .010 – .052 for E tuning). The Seymour Duncan Dave Mustaine Signature Live Wire pickups were announced at NAMM 2015 and the official product video was performed by Danny Young on the Seymour Duncan YouTube channel.

The Dean Zero debuted in 2010 with Dean guitars was a unique new shape for Mustaine, resembling the Gibson Explorer with sharper points. Mustaine has made a few appearances with this guitar, performing on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and on shows during the Australian tour with Slayer. He had also used the guitar in the later dates of the 2009 Endgame tour. He says he primarily still used his VMNT&#x27;s so he can grab on to the lower horn with his legs for certain songs. He had also used Ovation acoustic guitars for most of his career. However, he stopped endorsing the company after receiving a signature acoustic from Dean, dubbed the Mako.

Mustaine has his own signature Zoom pedal, called the Zoom G2.1DM.

In 2022, Mustaine switched from using a Fractal Axe-FX to a Neural DSP Quad Cortex on tour for his amp tones, sending the signal to a Seymour Duncan PowerStage poweramp and then to on-stage speaker cabinets.

==Musicianship==
Mustaine is known for popularizing the &quot;spider chord&quot; technique for playing power chords, a method streamlining hand position changes and reducing string noise.

Mustaine possesses a two-octave vocal range spanning from tenor through baritone pitch ranges.

In 2004, &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine ranked Mustaine and Marty Friedman together at No. 19 on the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time.

In 2009, Mustaine was named the No. 1 player in Joel McIver&#x27;s book &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot;. As he told &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine in September 2009: &quot;It was especially sweet when I found out that Joel has written books on Metallica. Every page I turned, I became more excited. I get to Number 5 and it&#x27;s Kirk Hammett, and I thought, &#x27;Thank you, God&#x27;. At that point it didn&#x27;t matter [which position I was]. To be better than both of them [James Hetfield and Hammett] meant so much – it&#x27;s been one of the pet peeves of my career and I&#x27;ve never known how to deal with it. All I thought was – I win!&quot;

In 2012, Mustaine was ranked the 12th-greatest guitarist of all time by a &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine reader&#x27;s poll.

==Personal life==
Mustaine married Pamela Anne Casselberry in 1991. They have two children together: Justis Mustaine (born 1992), who also plays the guitar and has appeared in several local theatrical productions, and Electra Mustaine (born 1998), who is pursuing a career in country music. , they live in Nashville, Tennessee.

===Health===
In 2011, Mustaine said that his neck and spine condition, known as stenosis, was caused by many years of headbanging.

On June 17, 2019, Mustaine announced that he had been diagnosed with throat cancer, and on January 31, 2020, during a Megadeth concert, he announced that he was now cancer free.

===Christianity===
Mustaine was raised as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and is now a born again Christian. In 1988, in response to the British government&#x27;s Section 28, Mustaine said: &quot;More power to them. It says in the Bible that men should not lay with men like they lay with women. I mean I don&#x27;t wanna fuck up and not go to heaven.&quot; In an answer to a question about Judas Priest having an overt homosexual image, Mustaine stated &quot;I don&#x27;t wanna talk about this.&quot; In 2012, on KIRO-FM he was asked if he supports gay marriage and replied: &quot;Well, since I&#x27;m not gay, the answer to that would be no.&quot; He was then asked if he would support legislation to make gay marriage legal and said, &quot;I&#x27;m Christian. The answer to that would be no.&quot;

Mustaine began to focus on his Christian faith more directly while attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and became a committed Christian. It has become his policy not to appear with any band that is seen as black metal or satanic, such as declining to appear in a music festival in Greece with the band Rotting Christ as well as in Israel with the band Dissection.

Mustaine had practiced black magic in his teenage years, which inspired several songs on Megadeth&#x27;s second album, &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; Mustaine stated that he no longer wishes to play those tracks because of his changed spiritual beliefs. He said of one such song, &quot;The Conjuring&quot;:

However, in 2016, Mustaine noted that Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler&#x27;s suggestion of re-recording the song with modified lyrics made him consider playing &quot;The Conjuring&quot; again, &quot;as long as it doesn&#x27;t hurt anybody&quot;.

===Politics===
Over his career, Mustaine has made numerous comments about both American and international politics, criticizing both politicians and political issues. In addition, Mustaine covered the 1992 Democratic National Convention for MTV.

In a 1988 interview with &quot;Sounds&quot; journalist Roy Wilkinson, Mustaine spoke against illegal immigration, and stated that he would &quot;build a great wall along the Mexican border and not let anybody in...&quot; if he were President of the United States.

In 1988, Mustaine caused a riot when Megadeth played a concert in Northern Ireland after he dedicated a song to &quot;the cause&quot;, later expressing surprise that this was a euphemism for supporting the Irish Republican Army in the conflict between Northern Ireland&#x27;s Catholic and Protestant communities known as the Troubles.

In 2009, Mustaine was interviewed by far-right conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones for &quot;InfoWars&quot;, in which Mustaine stated that the album &quot;Endgame&quot; was inspired by his Christian beliefs and belief in an upcoming New World Order. In a 2016 &quot;Fox Business&quot; interview, Mustaine stated that he does not align himself with any established political party, describing himself as an Independent.

====Criticism of Barack Obama and 2012 U.S. presidential election====

In the 2010s, Mustaine grew increasingly vocal in his support of many Republican figures and positions, which is a change from his politics during the George H. W. Bush administration, when Mustaine acted as a reporter for MTV News during the Democratic National Convention in 1992, and was seen as leaning to the political left, in light of the lyrics of &quot;Foreclosure of a Dream&quot;.

Mustaine has criticized several Democratic Party politicians. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Mustaine commented that he believed that John Kerry would &quot;ruin our country&quot;. In addition, Mustaine has made several comments critical of president Barack Obama, calling him &quot;the most divisive president we&#x27;ve ever had&quot; in 2011, and commenting that he believed that Obama was born outside of the United States during a March 2012 interview on &quot;George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight&quot;.

In an August 2012 Singapore performance on the tour to support the band&#x27;s then-new album &quot;Thirteen&quot;, Mustaine expressed his views of President Obama and recent gun violence in the United States, making an accusation that Obama had staged the shootings at Aurora, Colorado, and a Wisconsin Sikh temple in order to push a gun control agenda, while engaging the audience during onstage banter in between songs. Mustaine also criticized the &#x27;Fast and Furious&#x27; arms scandal and said that the country looked like it was turning into &quot;Nazi America&quot;.

Mustaine&#x27;s comments drew criticism from wounded Aurora massacre survivor Carli Richards, who said Mustaine was being &quot;absurd&quot; and that his conspiracy theory shifted blame away from the shooter, noting that &quot;[the president] didn&#x27;t shoot me&quot;. In response to the controversy over his comments, Mustaine told Alex Jones that his comments were done &quot;in the heat of the moment&quot;. He also denied any intention to hurt anyone with his comments, but believed that the possibility of a conspiracy should still be looked into.

In February 2012, Mustaine gave a statement supportive of the presidential campaign of conservative Republican and former United States Senator Rick Santorum. Mustaine commented on Santorum&#x27;s &quot;presidential qualities&quot; and pointed to Santorum&#x27;s temporary suspension of his campaign to be with his sick daughter as the act that gained his attention and respect. However, Mustaine denied that his statement was intended as an endorsement of Santorum. He expressed his hope that Santorum would win the nomination but stated that, regardless of the results, he would be voting against a second term for President Obama. Mustaine also criticized other Republican presidential candidates: he was critical of a $100 million trust fund that Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney set up for his sons and criticized Texas Congressman Ron Paul for his unorthodox political views, saying Paul &quot;make[s] total sense for a while, and then he&#x27;ll say something so way out that it negates everything else&quot;. Mustaine also admitted that he once supported former Georgia Congressman and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, but that he no longer thought he could vote for him.

===Martial arts===
Mustaine holds black belts in taekwondo and Ukidokan karate. In 2007, he was made a Goodwill Ambassador of the World by the World Taekwondo Federation. Mustaine has also trained Sanshou and Kickboxing and has recently become a dedicated practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In January 2021, he was awarded the rank of Purple Belt in the art. Shortly after Megadeth released their sixteenth studio album, Mustaine was promoted to brown belt in BJJ at the age of 61.

==Television appearances==
Mustaine has appeared on various television shows:
* In 1992 Mustaine covered the Democratic National Convention for MTV. He also hosted the MTV2 Television Network&#x27;s series &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; on two occasions: once on a tribute to Dimebag Darrell in December 2004 and the second time as a special guest on an episode that aired August 27, 2005. He also played the song &quot;Gears of War&quot; with Megadeth on an episode about the video game release under the same name.
* &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;: In the 1998 episode &quot;In Ramada Da Vida&quot;. When Drew and the gang decide to start a band, they audition guitarists, including Mustaine. After Mustaine plays a fast guitar solo, Lewis Kiniski tells him &quot;Don&#x27;t be nervous, son, just slow down,&quot; to which Mustaine replies, &quot;It&#x27;s supposed to sound that way.&quot; Drew replies by saying, &quot;Yeah, sure it is … next.&quot;
* &quot;Black Scorpion&quot;: In the episode &quot;Love Burns&quot;, Mustaine plays Torchy Thompson, a vengeful arsonist.
* &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot;: Mustaine and Megadeth appear in the 2005 episode &quot;In Space, No One Can Hear You Rock&quot;. In the show, Mustaine voices a cryogenically frozen version of himself. He is unfrozen because the main cast requires an incredibly loud noise to overload a Martian sonic weapon, and &quot;nobody rocks harder, faster, or louder than Dave Mustaine.&quot; During this episode, he played the song &quot;Back in the Day&quot; from the album &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;. Mustaine appeared again in the show in the finale, &quot;Bonafide Hero: Captain Duck Dodgers&quot;.
* &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;: Mustaine appeared on the second episode of season 8.
* Mustaine and Megadeth appeared in promotional videos for the NHL team Philadelphia Flyers in response to an inflammatory comment by Mike Wise in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that suggested that some of the Flyers&#x27; fans could work security for Megadeth. Mustaine invited them to do so in a video address, sporting the jersey of team captain Jason Smith.
* Mustaine appeared in an episode of &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!&quot; along with George Clinton and Moon Zappa. He won the game by a fair margin.
* Mustaine appeared in the reality series &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; as one of the Blue Team&#x27;s diners in season 14&#x27;s fifth dinner service.
* Mustaine was featured on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; &quot;Watter&#x27;s World&quot; segment on March 17, 2016.

<text>A binding knot is a knot that may be used to keep an object or multiple loose objects together, using a string or a rope that passes at least once around them. There are various binding knots, divided into two types. Friction knots are held in place by the friction between the windings of line. Knotted-ends knots are held in place by the two ends of the line being knotted together.

Whipping and seizing are binding knots, but are more complex since they contain many turns, like a lashing.

<text>Charleston is the most populous city in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina&#x27;s coastline on Charleston Harbor, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean formed by the confluence of the Ashley, Cooper, and Wando rivers. Charleston had a population of 150,227 at the 2020 census. The population of the Charleston metropolitan area, comprising Berkeley, Charleston, and Dorchester counties, was estimated to be 849,417 in 2023. It ranks as the third-most populous metropolitan area in the state and the 71st-most populous in the U.S. It is the county seat of Charleston County.

Charleston was founded by the English in 1670 as Charles Town (also spelled Charles Towne and Charlestowne through the end of the 17th century), in honor of King CharlesII. The settlement was first established at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River (now Charles Towne Landing), but it was relocated in 1680 to its present site and within ten years grew to become the fifth-largest city in North America. Charleston remained unincorporated throughout the colonial period; its government was handled directly by a colonial legislature and a governor sent by Parliament. Election districts were organized according to Anglican parishes, and some social services were managed by Anglican wardens and vestries. Charleston adopted its present spelling upon its incorporation as a city in 1783. Population growth in the interior of South Carolina influenced the removal of the state government to Columbia in 1788, but Charleston remained among the ten largest cities in the United States through the 1840 census.

Charleston&#x27;s significance in American history is tied to its role as a major slave trading port. Charleston slave traders like Joseph Wragg were the first to break through the monopoly of the Royal African Company and pioneered the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century; almost one-half of enslaved people imported to the United States arrived in Charleston. In 2018, the city formally apologized for its role in the American slave trade.

==History==


===Colonial era (1670–1776)===

King Charles II granted the chartered Province of Carolina to eight of his loyal friends, known as the Lords Proprietors, on March 24, 1663. In 1670, Governor William Sayle arranged for several shiploads of settlers from Bermuda and Barbados. These settlers established what was then called Charles Town at Albemarle Point, on the west bank of the Ashley River, a few miles northwest of the present-day city center. Charles Town became the first comprehensively planned town in the Thirteen Colonies. Its governance, settlement, and development were to follow a visionary plan known as the Grand Model prepared for the Lord&#x27;s Proprietors by John Locke. Because the Carolina&#x27;s Fundamental Constitutions was never ratified, however, Charles Town was never incorporated during the colonial period. Instead, local ordinances were passed by the provincial government, with day-to-day administration handled by the wardens and vestries of StPhilip&#x27;s and StMichael&#x27;s Anglican parishes.

At the time of European colonization, the area was inhabited by the indigenous Cusabo, on whom the settlers declared war in October 1671. The settlers initially allied with the Westo, a northern indigenous tribe that traded in enslaved Indians. The settlers abandoned their alliance with the Westo in 1679 and allied with the Cusabo instead.

The initial settlement quickly dwindled and disappeared while another village—established by the settlers on Oyster Point at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper rivers around 1672—thrived. In 1680, this second settlement formally replaced the original Charles Town, which today is commemorated as Charles Towne Landing. The second location was more defensible and had access to a fine natural harbor. The new town had become the fifth largest in North America by 1690.

A smallpox outbreak erupted in 1698, followed by an earthquake in February 1699. The latter caused a fire that destroyed about a third of the town. During rebuilding, a yellow fever outbreak killed about 15% of the remaining inhabitants. Charles Town suffered between five and eight significant yellow fever outbreaks over the first half of the 18th century.

It developed a reputation as one of the least healthy locations in the Thirteen Colonies for ethnic Europeans. Malaria was endemic. Although malaria did not have such high mortality as yellow fever, it caused much illness. It was a major health problem throughout most of the city&#x27;s history before dying out in the 1950s after the use of pesticides cut down on the mosquitoes that transmitted it.
Charles Town was fortified according to a plan developed in 1704 under Governor Nathaniel Johnson. Both Spain and France contested Britain&#x27;s claims to the region. Various bands of Native Americans and independent pirates also raided it.

On September 5–6, 1713 (O.S.), a violent hurricane passed over Charles Town. The Circular Congregational Church manse was damaged during the storm, and church records were lost. Much of Charles Town was flooded as &quot;the Ashley and Cooper rivers became one.&quot; At least seventy people died in the disaster.

From the 1670s, Charleston attracted pirates. The combination of a weak government and corruption made the city popular with pirates, who frequently visited and raided the city. Charles Town was besieged by the pirate Blackbeard for several days in May 1718. Blackbeard released his hostages and left in exchange for a chest of medicine from Governor Robert Johnson.

Around 1719, the town&#x27;s name began to be generally written as Charlestown and, excepting those fronting the Cooper River, the old walls were largely removed over the next decade. Charlestown was a center for the inland colonization of South Carolina. It remained the southernmost point of the Southern Colonies until the Province of Georgia was established in 1732. As noted, the first settlers primarily came from Europe, Barbados and Bermuda. The Barbadian and Bermudan immigrants were planters who brought enslaved Africans with them, having purchased them in the West Indies.

Early immigrant groups to the city included the Huguenots, Scottish, Irish, and Germans, as well as hundreds of Jews, predominately Sephardi from London and significant cities of the Dutch Republic, where they had been given refuge. As late as 1830, Charleston&#x27;s Jewish community was the most prominent and wealthiest in North America.

By 1708, most of the colony&#x27;s population were Black Africans. They had been brought to Charlestown via the Atlantic slave trade, first as indentured servants and then as enslaved people. In the early 1700s, Charleston&#x27;s largest slave trader, Joseph Wragg, pioneered the settlement&#x27;s involvement in the slave trade. Of the estimated 400,000 captive Africans transported to North America to be sold into slavery, 40% are thought to have landed at Sullivan&#x27;s Island off Charlestown. Free people of color also migrated from the West Indies, being descendants of white planters and their Black consorts and unions among the working classes.

In 1767, Gadsden&#x27;s Wharf was constructed at the city port on the Cooper River; it ultimately extended 840 feet and could accommodate six ships at a time. Many enslaved people were sold from here. Devoted to plantation agriculture that depended on enslaved labor, South Carolina became a slave society: it had a majority-Black population from the colonial period until after the Great Migration of the early 20th century, when many rural Blacks moved to northern and midwestern industrial cities to escape Jim Crow laws.
At the foundation of the town, the principal items of commerce were pine timber and pitch for ships and tobacco. The early economy developed around the deerskin trade, in which colonists used alliances with the Cherokee and Creek peoples to secure the raw material.

At the same time, Native Americans kidnapped and enslaved each other in warfare. From 1680 to 1720, approximately 40,000 native men, women, and children were sold through the port, principally to the West Indies such as (Bermuda and the Bahamas), but also to other Southern colonies. The Lowcountry planters did not keep enslaved Native Americans, considering them too prone to escape or revolt. They used the proceeds of their sale to purchase enslaved Black Africans for their own plantations. The slave raiding—and the European firearms it introduced—helped destabilize Spanish Florida and French Louisiana in the 1700s during the War of the Spanish Succession. But it also provoked the Yamasee War of the 1710s that nearly destroyed the colony. After that, South Carolina largely abandoned the Indian slave trade.

The area&#x27;s unsuitability for growing tobacco prompted the Lowcountry planters to experiment with other cash crops. The profitability of growing rice led the planters to pay premiums for enslaved people from the &quot;Rice Coast&quot; who knew its cultivation; their descendants make up the ethnic Gullah who created their own culture and language in this area. Slaves imported from the Caribbean showed the planter George Lucas&#x27;s daughter Eliza how to raise and use indigo for dyeing in 1747.

Throughout this period, enslaved people were sold aboard the arriving ships or at ad hoc gatherings in the town&#x27;s taverns. Runaways and minor slave rebellions prompted the 1739 Security Act, which required all white men to carry weapons at all times (even to church on Sundays). Before it fully took effect, the Cato or Stono Rebellion broke out. The white community had recently been decimated by a malaria outbreak, and the rebels killed about 25 white people before being stopped by the colonial militia. As a result of their fears of rebellion, whites killed a total of 35 to 50 Black people.

The planters attributed the violence to recently imported Africans and agreed to a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through Charlestown. They relied for labor upon the slave communities they already held. The 1740 Negro Act also tightened controls, requiring a ratio of one white for every ten Blacks on any plantation (which was often not achieved) and banning enslaved people from assembling, growing personal food, earning money, or learning to read. Drums were banned because Africans used them for signaling; enslaved people were allowed to use string and other instruments. When the moratorium expired and Charlestown reopened to the slave trade in 1750, the memory of the Stono Rebellion resulted in traders avoiding buying enslaved people from the Congo and Angola, whose populations had a reputation for independence.

By the mid-18th century, Charlestown was the hub of the Atlantic slave trade in the Southern Colonies. Even with the decade-long moratorium, its customs processed around 40% of the enslaved Africans brought to North America between 1700 and 1775, and about half up until the end of the African trade.

The plantations and the economy based on them made this the wealthiest city in the Thirteen Colonies and the largest in population south of Philadelphia. In 1770, the city had 11,000 inhabitants—half enslaved—and was the 4th-largest port in the colonies, after Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia.

The elite began to use their wealth to encourage cultural and social development. America&#x27;s first theater building was constructed in 1736; today&#x27;s Dock Street Theater later replaced it. StMichael&#x27;s was erected in 1753. Benevolent societies were formed by the Huguenots, free people of color, Germans, and Jews. The Library Society was established in 1748 by well-born young men who wanted to share the financial cost of keeping up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day.

===American Revolution (1776–1783)===
Delegates for the Continental Congress were elected in 1774, and South Carolina declared its independence from Britain on the steps of the Exchange. Slavery was again an important factor in the city&#x27;s role during the Revolutionary War. The British attacked the settlement three times, assuming that the settlement had a large base of Loyalists who would rally to their cause once given some military support. The loyalty of white Southerners towards the Crown had largely been forfeited, however, by British legal cases (such as the 1772 Somersett case which marked the prohibition of slavery in England and Wales, a significant milestone in the abolitionist struggle) and military tactics (such as Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation in 1775) that promised the emancipation of people enslaved by Patriot planters; these efforts did, however, unsurprisingly win the allegiance of thousands of Black Loyalists.

The Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island saw the British fail to capture a partially constructed palmetto palisade from Col. Moultrie&#x27;s militia regiment on June 28, 1776. The Liberty Flag used by Moultrie&#x27;s men formed the basis of the later South Carolina flag, and the victory&#x27;s anniversary continues to be commemorated as Carolina Day.

Making the capture of Charlestown their chief priority, the British sent Sir Henry Clinton, who laid siege to Charleston on April 1, 1780, with about 14,000 troops and 90 ships. Bombardment began on March 11, 1780. The Patriots, led by Benjamin Lincoln, had about 5,500 men and inadequate fortifications to repel the forces against them. After the British cut his supply lines and lines of retreat at the battles of Monck&#x27;s Corner and Lenud&#x27;s Ferry, Lincoln&#x27;s surrender on May 12, 1780, became the greatest American defeat of the war.

The British continued to hold Charlestown for over a year following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781. However, they alienated local planters by refusing to restore full civil government. Nathanael Greene had entered the state after Cornwallis&#x27;s pyrrhic victory at Guilford Courthouse and kept the area under a kind of siege. British Army officer Alexander Leslie, commanding Charlestown, requested a truce in March 1782 to purchase food for his garrison and the town&#x27;s inhabitants. Greene refused and formed a brigade under Mordecai Gist to counter British forays. The British finally evacuated Charlestown in December 1782. Greene presented the British leaders of the town with the Moultrie Flag.

===Antebellum era (1783–1861)===


Between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, Charleston experienced an economic boom, at least for the top strata of society. Expanding cotton as a cash crop in the South led to massive wealth for a small segment of society and funded impressive architecture and culture. However, it also escalated the economic importance of enslaving people and led to greater and greater restrictions on Black Charlestonians.

By 1783, the city&#x27;s growth had reached a point where a municipal government became desirable; therefore, on August 13, 1783, an act of incorporation for Charleston was ratified. The act originally specified the city&#x27;s name as &quot;Charles Ton&quot;, as opposed to the previous Charlestown, but the spelling &quot;Charleston&quot; quickly came to dominate.

Although Columbia had replaced it as the state capital in 1788, Charleston became even more prosperous as Eli Whitney&#x27;s 1793 invention of the cotton gin sped the processing of the crop over 50 times. Britain&#x27;s Industrial Revolution—initially built upon its textile industry—took up the extra production ravenously and cotton became Charleston&#x27;s major export commodity in the 19th century.
The Bank of South Carolina, the second-oldest building in the nation to be constructed as a bank, was established in 1798. In 1800 and 1817, branches of the First and Second banks were also located in Charleston.

Throughout the Antebellum Period, Charleston continued to be the only major American city with a majority-slave population. The city&#x27;s widespread use of enslaved people as workers was a frequent subject of writers and visitors: a merchant from Liverpool noted in 1834 that &quot;almost all the working population are Negroes, all the servants, the carmen &amp; porters, all the people who see at the stalls in Market, and most of the Journeymen in trades&quot;. American traders had been prohibited from equipping the Atlantic slave trade in 1794 and all importation of enslaved people was banned in 1808, but American merchantmen frequently refused to permit British inspection for enslaved cargo, and smuggling remained common. Much more important was the domestic slave trade, which boomed as the Deep South developed into new cotton plantations. As a result of the trade, there was a forced migration of more than one million enslaved people from the Upper South to the Lower South in the antebellum years. During the early 19th century, the first dedicated slave markets were founded in Charleston, mostly near Chalmers and State streets. Many domestic slavers used Charleston as a port in the coastwise trade, traveling to such ports as Mobile and New Orleans.

Enslaving was the primary marker of class, and even the town&#x27;s freedmen and free people of color typically enslaved people if they had the wealth to do so. Visitors commonly remarked on the sheer number of Blacks in Charleston and their seeming freedom of movement, though in fact—mindful of the Stono Rebellion and the slave revolution that established Haiti—the whites closely regulated the behavior of both enslaved and free people of color. The town fixed wages and hiring practices, sometimes required identifying badges, and sometimes censored work songs. Punishment was handled out of sight by the city&#x27;s workhouse, whose fees provided the municipal government with thousands a year. In 1820, state law mandated that each act of manumission (freeing an enslaved person) required legislative approval, effectively halting the practice.

The effects of slavery were pronounced on white society as well. The high cost of enslaving people in the 19th century and their high rate of return combined to institute an oligarchic society controlled by about ninety interrelated families, where 4% of the free population controlled half of the wealth, and the lower half of the free population—unable to compete with enslaved or rented people—held no wealth at all. The white middle class was minimal: Charlestonians generally looked down upon hard work, considering it as labor meant for enslaved people. All the enslavers taken together held 82% of the city&#x27;s wealth and almost all non-enslavers were poor. Olmsted considered their civic elections &quot;entirely contests of money and personal influence&quot; and the oligarchs dominated civic planning: The lack of public parks and amenities was noted, as was the abundance of private gardens in the wealthy&#x27;s walled estates.

In the 1810s, the town&#x27;s churches intensified their discrimination against their Black parishioners, culminating in Bethel Methodist&#x27;s 1817 construction of a hearse house over its Black burial ground. 4,376 Black Methodists joined Morris Brown in establishing Hampstead Church, the African Methodist Episcopal church now known as Mother Emanuel. State and city laws prohibited Black literacy, limited Black worship to daylight hours, and required a majority of any church&#x27;s parishioners be white. In June 1818, 140 Black church members at Hampstead Church were arrested, and eight of its leaders were given fines and ten lashes; police raided the church again in 1820 and pressured it in 1821.

In 1822, members of the church, led by Denmark Vesey, a lay preacher and carpenter who had bought his freedom after winning a lottery, planned an uprising and escape to Haiti—initially for Bastille Day—that failed when one enslaved person revealed the plot to his enslaver. Over the next month, the city&#x27;s intendant (mayor) James Hamilton Jr. organized a militia for regular patrols, initiated a secret and extrajudicial tribunal to investigate, and hanged 35 and exiled 35 or 37 enslaved people to Spanish Cuba for their involvement. Hamilton imposed more restrictions on both free and enslaved Blacks: South Carolina required free Black sailors to be imprisoned while their ships were in Charleston Harbor, although international treaties eventually required the United States to quash the practice; free Blacks were banned from returning to the state if they left for any reason; enslaved people were given a 9:15 pm curfew; the city razed Hampstead Church to the ground and erected a new arsenal. This structure later was the basis of the Citadel&#x27;s first campus. The AME congregation built a new church, but in 1834, the city banned it and all Black worship services following Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion in Virginia in 1831. The estimated 10% of enslaved people who came to America as Muslims never had a separate mosque. Enslavers sometimes provided them with beef rations instead of pork in recognition of religious traditions.

The registered tonnage of Charleston shipping in 1829 was 12,410. In 1832, South Carolina passed an ordinance of nullification, a procedure by which a state could, in effect, repeal a federal law; it was directed against the most recent tariff acts. Soon, U.S. soldiers were dispensed to Charleston&#x27;s forts, and five United States Coast Guard cutters were detached to Charleston Harbor &quot;to take possession of any vessel arriving from a foreign port, and defend her against any attempt to dispossess the Customs Officers of her custody until all the requirements of law have been complied with.&quot; This federal action became known as the Charleston incident. The state&#x27;s politicians worked on a compromise law in Washington to gradually reduce the tariffs.

Charleston&#x27;s embrace of classical architecture began after a devastating fire leveled much of the city. On April 27, 1838, Charleston suffered a catastrophic fire that burned more than 1000 buildings and caused about $3 million () in damage at the time. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. A great cultural awakening occurred when many homes and businesses were rebuilt or repaired. Before the fire, few homes were styled as Greek Revival; many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued, making Charleston one of the foremost places to view Greek Revival architecture. The Gothic Revival also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion.

By 1840, the Market Hall and Sheds, where fresh meat and produce were brought daily, became a hub of commercial activity. The slave trade also depended on the port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded and enslaved people bought and sold. The legal importation of enslaved Africans had ended in 1808, although smuggling was significant. However, the domestic trade was booming. More than one million enslaved people were transported from the Upper South to the Deep South in the antebellum years, as cotton plantations were widely developed through what became known as the Black Belt. Many enslaved people were transported in the coastwise slave trade, with slave ships stopping at ports such as Charleston.

=== American Civil War (1861–1865)===


Charleston was significant in the American Civil War. As a pivotal city, the U.S. Army and Confederate States Army vied for control of it. The rebellion began in Charleston Harbor in 1861 and ended mere months after the U.S. soldiers retook control of Charleston in 1865.

Following the election of Abraham Lincoln, the South Carolina General Assembly voted on December 20, 1860, to declare secession from the United States, becoming the first state to do so. On December 27, the U.S. Army garrison of Castle Pinckney surrendered to the state militia. On January 9, 1861, Citadel cadets opened fire on the USS&quot;Star of the West&quot; as it entered Charleston Harbor.

The first full battle of the war occurred on April 12, 1861, when shore batteries under the command of General P. G. T. Beauregard fired upon the held Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. After a 34-hour bombardment, Major Robert Anderson surrendered the fort.

On December 11, 1861, an enormous fire burned over of the city.

U.S. Navy control of the North Atlantic coastline permitted the repeated bombardment of the city, causing vast damage. Although Admiral Du Pont&#x27;s naval assault on the town&#x27;s forts in April 1863 failed, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s blockade shut down most commercial traffic. Throughout the war, some blockade runners got through, but not a single one made it into or out of Charleston Harbor between August 1863 and March 1864. The early submarine &quot;H.L. Hunley&quot; made a night attack on the on February 17, 1864.

General Gillmore&#x27;s land assault in July 1864 was unsuccessful but the fall of Columbia and advance of General William T. Sherman&#x27;s army through the state prompted the Confederates to evacuate the town on February 17, 1865, burning the public buildings, cotton warehouses, and other sources of supply before their departure. U.S. soldiers liberated the city within the month. The War Department recovered what federal property remained. Also, it confiscated the campus of the Citadel Military Academy and used it as a U.S. Army garrison for the next 17 years. The facilities were finally returned to the state and reopened as a military college in 1882 under the direction of Lawrence E. Marichak.

===Postbellum (1865–1945)===
====Reconstruction====
After the defeat of the Confederacy, U.S. soldiers remained in Charleston during the Reconstruction era. The war had shattered the city&#x27;s prosperity. Still, the African-American population surged (from 17,000 in 1860 to over 27,000 in 1880) as freedmen moved from the countryside to the major city. Blacks quickly left the Southern Baptist Church and resumed open meetings of the African Methodist Episcopal and AME Zion churches. They purchased dogs, guns, liquor, and better clothes—all previously banned—and ceased yielding the sidewalks to whites. Despite the efforts of the state legislature to halt manumissions, Charleston had already had a large class of free people of color as well. At the onset of the war, the city had 3,785 free people of color, many of mixed race, making up about 18% of the city&#x27;s black population and 8% of its total population. Many were educated and practiced skilled crafts; they quickly became leaders of South Carolina&#x27;s Republican Party and its legislators. Free men of color comprised 26% of those elected to state and federal office in South Carolina from 1868 to 1876.

The Pacific Guano Company, established in 1861, opened a plant in Charleston which consumed immense quantities of menhaden scrap brought from the water by the vessels which carried on their return trip a supply of South Carolina phosphates for the Woods Hole, Massachusetts factory. By the late 1870s, industry was bringing the city and its inhabitants back to a renewed vitality; new jobs attracted new residents. As the city&#x27;s commerce improved, residents worked to restore or create community institutions. In 1865, the Avery Normal Institute was established by the American Missionary Association as the first free secondary school for Charleston&#x27;s African American population. Gen. Sherman lent his support to the conversion of the United States Arsenal into the Porter Military Academy, an educational facility for former soldiers and boys left orphaned or destitute by the war. Porter Military Academy later joined with Gaud School and is now a university-preparatory school, Porter-Gaud School.

In 1875, blacks made up 57% of the city&#x27;s and 73% of the county&#x27;s population. With leadership by members of the antebellum free black community, historian Melinda Meeks Hennessy described the community as &quot;unique&quot; in being able to defend themselves without provoking &quot;massive white retaliation&quot;, as occurred in numerous other areas during Reconstruction. In the 1876 election cycle, two major riots between black Republicans and white Democrats occurred in the city, in September and the day after the election in November, as well as a violent incident in Cainhoy at an October joint discussion meeting.

Violent incidents occurred throughout the Piedmont of the state as white insurgents struggled to impose white supremacy in the face of social changes after the war and the granting of citizenship to freedmen by amendments to the U.S. Constitution. After former Confederates were allowed to vote again, election campaigns from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation of blacks and Republicans by conservative Democratic paramilitary groups, known as the Red Shirts. Violent incidents occurred in Charleston on King Street on September 6 and nearby Cainhoy on October 15 in association with political meetings before the 1876 election. The Cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed than blacks. The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electing Wade Hampton as governor, and taking back control of the state legislature. Another riot occurred in Charleston the day after the election when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly reported killed.

====Politics====
In the early 20th century, strong political machines emerged in the city, reflecting economic, class, racial, and ethnic tensions. The factions nearly all opposed U.S. Senator Ben Tillman who repeatedly attacked and ridiculed the city in the name of upstate poor farmers. Well-organized factions within the Democratic Party in Charleston gave the voters clear choices and played a large role in state politics.

====1886 earthquake====

On August 31, 1886, Charleston experienced a strong earthquake. The shock was estimated to have a moment magnitude of 7.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (&quot;Extreme&quot;). It was felt as far away as Boston to the north, Chicago and Milwaukee to the northwest, as far west as New Orleans, as far south as Cuba, and as far east as Bermuda. It damaged 2,000 buildings in Charleston and caused $6 million worth of damage ($ million in dollars), at a time when all the city&#x27;s buildings were valued around $24 million ($ million in dollars).

====Charleston race riots====

The Charleston race riot of 1919 took place on the night of Saturday, May 10, between members of the US Navy and the local black population. They attacked black individuals, businesses, and homes, killing six and injuring dozens.

===Contemporary era (1945–present)===
Charleston languished economically for several decades in the 20th century, though the large federal military presence in the region helped to shore up the city&#x27;s economy. Charleston&#x27;s tourism boom began in earnest following the publication of Albert Simons and Samuel Lapham&#x27;s &quot;Architecture of Charleston&quot; in the 1920s.

The Charleston Hospital Strike of 1969, in which mostly black workers protested discrimination and low wages, was one of the last major events of the civil rights movement. It attracted Ralph Abernathy, Coretta Scott King, Andrew Young, and other prominent figures to march with the local leader, Mary Moultrie.

Joseph P. Riley Jr. was elected mayor in the 1970s and helped advance several cultural aspects of the city.

Between 1989 and 1996, Charleston saw two significant economic hits. First, the eye of Hurricane Hugo came ashore at Charleston Harbor in 1989, and though the worst damage was in nearby McClellanville, three-quarters of the homes in Charleston&#x27;s historic district sustained damage of varying degrees. The hurricane caused over $2.8 billion in damage. The city rebounded fairly quickly after the hurricane and has grown in population, reaching an estimated 124,593 residents in 2009. Second, in 1993, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) directed that Naval Base Charleston be closed. Pursuant to BRAC action, Naval Base Charleston was closed on April 1, 1996, although some activities remain under the cognizance of Naval Support Activity Charleston, now part of Joint Base Charleston.

After having been a majority-minority city for most of its history, in the late 20th century, many whites began returning to the urban core of Charleston, and the area gentrified with rising prices and rents. From 1980 to 2010, the peninsula&#x27;s population shifted from two-thirds black to two-thirds white; in 2010, residents numbered 20,668 whites and 10,455 blacks. Many African Americans moved to the less-expensive suburbs in these decades.

On June 17, 2015, 21-year-old white supremacist Dylann Roof entered the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and sat in on part of a Bible study before shooting and killing nine people and injuring a tenth, all African Americans. Senior pastor Clementa Pinckney, who also served as a state senator, was among those killed during the attack. The deceased also included congregation members Susie Jackson, 87; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Ethel Lance, 70; Myra Thompson, 59; Cynthia Hurd, 54; Rev. Depayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; and Tywanza Sanders, 26. The attack garnered national attention and sparked a debate on racism, Confederate symbolism in Southern states, and gun violence, in part based on Roof&#x27;s online postings. A memorial service on the campus of the College of Charleston was attended by President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Jill Biden, and Speaker of the House John Boehner.

====Condemnation of role in the slave trade====
On June 17, 2018, the Charleston City Council apologized for its role in the slave trade and condemned its &quot;inhumane&quot; history. It also acknowledged wrongs committed against African Americans by slavery and Jim Crow laws.

==Geography==
The city proper consists of six distinct districts.
* Downtown, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Peninsula&quot;, is Charleston&#x27;s center city separated by the Ashley River to the west and the Cooper River to the east
* West Ashley, residential area to the west of Downtown bordered by the Ashley River to the east and the Stono River to the west
* Johns Island, far western limits of Charleston, bordered by the Stono River to the east, Kiawah River to the south, and Wadmalaw Island to the west
* James Island, a popular residential area between Downtown and the town of Folly Beach with portions of the independent town of James Island intermixed
* Cainhoy Peninsula, far eastern limits of Charleston, bordered by the Wando River to the west and Nowell Creek to the east
* Daniel Island, residential area to the north of downtown, east of the Cooper River and west of the Wando River

===Topography===

The incorporated city fit into as late as World War I, but has since greatly expanded, crossing the Ashley River and encompassing James Island and some of Johns Island. The city limits also have expanded across the Cooper River, encompassing Daniel Island and the Cainhoy area. The present city has a total area of , of which is land and (15.11%) is water. North Charleston blocks any expansion up the peninsula, and Mount Pleasant occupies the land directly east of the Cooper River.

Charleston Harbor runs about southeast to the Atlantic with an average width of about , surrounded on all sides except its entrance. Sullivan&#x27;s Island lies to the north of the entrance and Morris Island to the south. The entrance itself is about wide; it was originally only deep but began to be enlarged in the 1870s. The tidal rivers (Wando, Cooper, Stono, and Ashley) are evidence of a submergent or drowned coastline. There is a submerged river delta off the mouth of the harbor, and the Cooper River is deep.

===Climate===

Charleston has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), with mild winters, hot humid summers, and significant rainfall all year long. Summer is the wettest season; almost half of the annual rainfall occurs from June to September in the form of thundershowers. Fall remains relatively warm through the middle of November. Winter is short and mild and is characterized by occasional rain. Measurable snow (≥) has a median occurrence of only once per decade at the airport, but freezing rain is more common; a snowfall/freezing rain event on January 3, 2018, was the first such event in Charleston since December 26, 2010. However, fell at the airport on December 23, 1989, during the December 1989 United States cold wave, the largest single-day fall on record, contributing to a single-storm and seasonal record of snowfall.

Downtown Charleston&#x27;s climate is milder than the airport&#x27;s due to more substantial maritime influence. This is especially true in the winter, with the average January low in downtown being to the airport&#x27;s for example.

The highest temperature recorded within city limits was on June 2, 1985, and June 24, 1944; the lowest was on February 14, 1899, although there was an unofficial record low of in February 1835. At the airport, where official records are kept, the historical range is on August 1, 1999, down to on January 21, 1985. Hurricanes are a major threat to the area during the summer and early fall, with several severe hurricanes hitting the area—most notably Hurricane Hugo on September 21, 1989 (a category 4 storm). The dewpoint from June to August ranges from .
===Metropolitan statistical area===
As defined by the Office of Management and Budget, for use by the U.S. Census Bureau and other U.S. Government agencies for statistical purposes only, Charleston is included within the Charleston-North Charleston, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of three counties: Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester. The metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 849,417 in 2023. North Charleston is the second-largest city in the metro area and ranks as the third-largest city in the state; Mount Pleasant and Summerville are the next-largest cities.

The traditional parish system persisted until counties were established during the Reconstruction Era. Nevertheless, traditional parishes still exist in various capacities, mainly as public service districts. When the city of Charleston was formed, it was defined by the limits of the Parish of St. Philip and St. Michael, which now also includes parts of St. James&#x27; Parish, St. George&#x27;s Parish, St. Andrew&#x27;s Parish, and St. John&#x27;s Parish. However, the last two are mostly still incorporated rural parishes.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
As of the 2020 census, there were 150,227 people, 58,902 households, and 31,780 families residing in the city.

In 2023, of the 150,227 people in Charleston, about 134,996 of them lived in Charleston County, and 15,231 of them lived in Berkeley County.

===Language===
Given Charleston&#x27;s high concentration of African Americans who spoke the Gullah language, a creole language that developed on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country, the local speech patterns were also influenced by this community. Today, Gullah is still spoken by many African American residents. However, rapid development since 1980, especially on the surrounding Sea Islands, has attracted residents from outside the area and led to a decline in Gullah&#x27;s prominence.

The traditional educated Charleston accent has long been noted throughout the state and South. It is typically heard in wealthy European American older people who trace their families back generations in the city. It has ingliding or monophthongal long mid-vowels, raises &quot;ay&quot; and &quot;aw&quot; in certain environments, and is nonrhotic. Sylvester Primer of the College of Charleston wrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: &quot;Charleston Provincialisms&quot; (1887) and &quot;The Huguenot Element in Charleston&#x27;s Provincialisms&quot;, published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on English, as the earliest settlers spoke it; therefore, it was derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The disappearing &quot;Charleston accent&quot; spoken mainly by older natives is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city&#x27;s name. Many Charleston natives ignore the &#x27;r&#x27; and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as &quot;Chalston&quot;.

===Religion===
Charleston is known as &quot;the Holy City&quot;. Despite beliefs that the term dates to the city&#x27;s earliest days and refers to its religiously tolerant culture, the expression was coined in the 20th century, likely as a mockery of Charlestonians&#x27; self-satisfied attitude about their city. Many sources, however, traditionally link the term to the many old church spires dotting the skyline of downtown Charleston. Regardless of the nickname&#x27;s origin, residents have embraced the term and have explained it in more flattering ways.

The Anglican church was dominant in the colonial era, and the Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul is today the seat of the Anglican Diocese of South Carolina. St. John&#x27;s Protestant Episcopal Church is another historic church in Charleston. Many French Huguenot refugees settled in Charleston in the early 18th century. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the Southern United States and houses the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, Maryland.

South Carolina has long allowed Jews to practice their faith without restriction. Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim, founded in 1749 by Sephardic Jews from London, is the fourth-oldest Jewish congregation in the continental United States and was an important site for the development of Reform Judaism. Brith Sholom Beth Israel is the oldest Orthodox synagogue in the South, founded by Sam Berlin and other Ashkenazi German and Central European Jews in the mid-19th century.

The city&#x27;s oldest Catholic parish, St. Mary of the Annunciation Catholic Church is the mother church of Catholicism in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. In 1820, Charleston was established as the see city of the Diocese of Charleston, which at the time comprised the Carolinas and Georgia and presently encompasses the state of South Carolina.

The Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite, established in Charleston in 1801, is considered the mother council of the world by Scottish Rite Freemasons.

==Culture==
Charleston&#x27;s culture blends traditional Southern U.S., English, French, and West African elements. The downtown peninsula has several arts, music, local cuisine, and fashion venues. Spoleto Festival USA, held annually in late spring, was founded in 1977 by Pulitzer Prize–winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti, who sought to establish a counterpart to the &quot;Festival dei Due Mondi&quot; (the Festival of Two Worlds) in Spoleto, Italy.

Charleston&#x27;s oldest community theater group, the Footlight Players, has provided theatrical productions since 1931. A variety of performing arts venues includes the historic Dock Street Theatre. The annual Charleston Fashion Week held each spring in Marion Square brings in designers, journalists, and clients nationwide. Charleston is known for its local seafood, which plays a key role in the city&#x27;s renowned cuisine, comprising staple dishes such as gumbo, she-crab soup, fried oysters, Lowcountry boil, deviled crab cakes, red rice, and shrimp and grits. Rice is a staple in many dishes, reflecting the rice culture of the Low Country. The cuisine in Charleston is also strongly influenced by British and French elements.

===Annual cultural events and fairs===
Charleston annually hosts Spoleto Festival USA founded by Gian Carlo Menotti, a 17-day art festival featuring over 100 performances by individual artists in various disciplines. The annual Piccolo Spoleto festival takes place at the same time and features local performers and artists, with hundreds of performances throughout the city. Other festivals and events include Historic Charleston Foundation&#x27;s Festival of Houses and Gardens and Charleston Antiques Show, the Taste of Charleston, The Lowcountry Oyster Festival, the Cooper River Bridge Run, The Charleston Marathon, Southeastern Wildlife Exposition (SEWE), Charleston Food and Wine Festival, Charleston Fashion Week, the MOJA Arts Festival, and the Holiday Festival of Lights (at James Island County Park), and the Charleston International Film Festival. The Charleston Conference is a major library industry event, held in the city center since 1980.

===Music===
The Gullah community has had a tremendous influence on music in Charleston, especially when it comes to the early development of jazz music. In turn, Charleston&#x27;s music has influenced the rest of the country. The geechee dances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in Charleston followed a rhythm that inspired Eubie Blake&#x27;s &quot;Charleston Rag&quot; and later James P. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Charleston&quot;, as well as the dance craze that defined a nation in the 1920s. &quot;Ballin&#x27; the Jack&quot;, which was a popular dance in the years before &quot;Charleston&quot;, was written by native Charlestonian Chris Smith.

The Jenkins Orphanage was established in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments, and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on various instruments and could read music expertly. These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. William &quot;Cat&quot; Anderson, Jabbo Smith, and Freddie Green are but a few of the alumni who became professional musicians. Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band&#x27;s success.

As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The Jenkins Orphanage Band played in the inaugural parades of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft and toured the US and Europe. The band also played on Broadway for the play &quot;Porgy&quot; by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, a stage version of their novel of the same title. The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community. The Heywards insisted on hiring the genuine Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage. Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated with George and Ira Gershwin to turn his novel into the now famous opera, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (so named to distinguish it from the play). George Gershwin and Heyward spent the summer of 1934 at Folly Beach outside of Charleston writing this &quot;folk opera&quot;, as Gershwin called it. &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; is considered one of the first Great American Operas and is widely performed.

To this day, Charleston is home to many musicians in all genres. For example, Heyrocco is a lcoal indie band.

It replaced the Grace Memorial Bridge (built in 1929) and the Silas N. Pearman Bridge (built in 1966). They were considered two of the more dangerous bridges in America and were demolished after the Ravenel Bridge opened.

===City bus service===
The city is also served by a bus system operated by the Charleston Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA). Most of the urban area is served by regional fixed-route buses equipped with bike racks as part of the system&#x27;s Rack and Ride program. CARTA offers connectivity to historic downtown attractions and accommodations with the Downtown Area Shuttle trolley buses, and it offers curbside pickup for disabled passengers with its Tel-A-Ride buses.

The Port of Charleston, owned and operated by the South Carolina Ports Authority, is one of the largest ports in the United States, ranked seventh in the top 25 by containerized cargo volume in 2018. It consists of six terminals, with the sixth opening in April 2021. Port activity at the two terminals located in the city of Charleston is one of the city&#x27;s leading sources of revenue, behind tourism.

Today, the Port of Charleston boasts the deepest water in the southeast region and regularly handles ships too big to transit through the Panama Canal. A harbor-deepening project was completed, which makes the Port of Charleston&#x27;s entrance channel a depth of and harbor channel 52 feet at mean low tide.

Beginning in May 2019, until cruise operations were interrupted in April 2020, the Carnival &quot;Sunshine&quot; was permanently stationed in Charleston, offering 4, 5, and 7-day cruises to the Caribbean.

With the closure of the Naval Base and the Charleston Naval Shipyard in 1996, Detyens, Inc. signed a long-term lease. Detyens Shipyard, Inc. is one of the East Coast&#x27;s most extensive commercial marine repair facilities, with three dry docks, one floating dock, and six piers. Projects include military, commercial, and cruise ships.

==Education==
Because most of the city of Charleston is located in Charleston County, it is served by the Charleston County School District, which covers all of Charleston County. Part of the city, however, is served by the Berkeley County School District, which covers all of Berkeley County. This Berkeley County section includes northern portions of the city, such as the Cainhoy Industrial District, Cainhoy Historical District, and Daniel Island.

Charleston is also served by a large number of independent schools, including Porter-Gaud School (K-12), Charleston Collegiate School (K-12), Ashley Hall (Pre K-12), Charleston Day School (K-8), First Baptist Church School (K-12), Palmetto Christian Academy (K-12), Coastal Christian Preparatory School (K-12), Mason Preparatory School (K-8), and Addlestone Hebrew Academy (K-8).

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston Office of Education also operates out of the city and oversees several K-8 parochial schools, such as Blessed Sacrament School, Christ Our King School, Charleston Catholic School, Nativity School, and Divine Redeemer School, all of which are &quot;feeder&quot; schools into Bishop England High School, a diocesan high school within the city. Bishop England, Porter-Gaud School, and Ashley Hall are the city&#x27;s oldest and most prominent private schools and are a significant part of Charleston&#x27;s history, dating back some 150 years.

Public institutions of higher education in Charleston include the College of Charleston, The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, and the Medical University of South Carolina. The city is also home to private schools, including the Charleston Southern University and Charleston School of Law. Charleston is also home to the Roper Hospital School of Practical Nursing, and the city has a downtown satellite campus for the region&#x27;s technical school, Trident Technical College. Charleston has the only college in the country that offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the building arts, The American College of the Building Arts.

==Sister cities==
Charleston&#x27;s sister cities are:
* Doha, Qatar
* Freetown, Sierra Leone
* Panama City, Panama
* Speightstown, Barbados
* Spoleto, Italy
* Flers, France

The relationship with Spoleto began when Pulitzer Prize-winning Italian composer Gian Carlo Menotti selected Charleston as the city to host the American version of Spoleto&#x27;s annual Festival of Two Worlds. &quot;Looking for a city that would provide the charm of Spoleto, as well as its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces, they selected Charleston, South Carolina, as the ideal location. The historic city provided a perfect fit: intimate enough that the Festival would captivate the entire city, yet cosmopolitan enough to provide an enthusiastic audience and robust infrastructure.&quot;

Sister city relation with Panama City was described as follows:
Charleston is also twinned with Speightstown. The first colonists to settle in the region designed the original parts of Charlestown based on the plans of Barbados&#x27;s capital city, Bridgetown. Many indigo, tobacco, and cotton planters relocated their plantation operations and the people they enslaved from Speightstown to Charleston after the sugarcane industry came to dominate agricultural production in Barbados.

<doc id="61026" wikidata="Q679" url="?curid=61026" title="West">
<text>West is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from east and is the direction in which the Sun sets on the Earth.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;west&quot; is a Germanic word passed into some Romance languages (&quot;ouest&quot; in French, &quot;oest&quot; in Catalan, &quot;ovest&quot; in Italian, &quot;oeste&quot; in Spanish and Portuguese). As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: &#x27;west&#x27; derives from the Indo-European root &quot;*wes&quot; reduced from &quot;*wes-pero&quot; &#x27;evening, night&#x27;, cognate with Ancient Greek ἕσπερος hesperos &#x27;evening; evening star; western&#x27; and Latin vesper &#x27;evening; west&#x27;. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin occidens &#x27;west&#x27; from occidō &#x27;to go down, to set&#x27; and Hebrew מַעֲרָב (maarav) &#x27;west&#x27; from עֶרֶב (erev) &#x27;evening&#x27;.

West is sometimes abbreviated as W.

==Navigation==
To go west using a compass for navigation (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) one needs to set a bearing or azimuth of 270°.

West is the direction opposite that of the Earth&#x27;s rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun appears to constantly progress and eventually set. This is not true on the planet Venus, which rotates in the opposite direction from the Earth (retrograde rotation). To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east although Venus&#x27;s opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet&#x27;s surface.

In a map with north at the top, west is on the left.

Moving continuously west is following a circle of latitude.

==Weather==
Due to the direction of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, the prevailing wind in many places in the middle latitudes (i.e. between 35 and 65 degrees latitude) is from the west, known as the westerlies.

==Cultural==

The phrase &quot;the West&quot; is often spoken in reference to the Western world, which includes the European Union (also the EFTA countries), the United Kingdom, the Americas, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and (in part) South Africa.

The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the Western Roman Empire and the Western Christianity. During the Cold War &quot;the West&quot; was often used to refer to the NATO camp as opposed to the Warsaw Pact and non-aligned nations. The expression survives, with an increasingly ambiguous meaning.

==Symbolic meanings==
In Chinese Buddhism, the West represents movement toward the Buddha or enlightenment (see Journey to the West). The ancient Aztecs believed that the West was the realm of the great goddess of water, mist, and maize. In Ancient Egypt, the West was considered to be the portal to the netherworld, and is the cardinal direction regarded in connection with death, though not always with a negative connotation. Ancient Egyptians also believed that the Goddess Amunet was a personification of the West. The Celts believed that beyond the western sea off the edges of all maps lay the Otherworld, or Afterlife.

In Judaism, west is seen to be toward the Shekinah (presence) of God, as in Jewish history the Tabernacle and subsequent Jerusalem Temple faced east, with God&#x27;s Presence in the Holy of Holies up the steps to the west. According to the Bible, the Israelites crossed the Jordan River westward into the Promised Land.

In American literature (e.g., in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;) moving West has sometimes symbolized gaining freedom, perhaps as an association with the settling of the Wild West (see also the American frontier and Manifest Destiny).

<doc id="61028" wikidata="Q684" url="?curid=61028" title="East">
<text>East is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from west and is the direction from which the Sun rises on the Earth.

==Etymology==
As in other languages, the word is formed from the fact that east is the direction where the Sun rises: &quot;east&quot; comes from Middle English &quot;est&quot;, from Old English &quot;ēast&quot;, which itself comes from the Proto-Germanic *&quot;aus-to-&quot; or *&quot;austra-&quot; &quot;east, toward the sunrise&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European *aus- &quot;to shine,&quot; or &quot;dawn&quot;, cognate with Old High German &quot;*ōstar&quot; &quot;to the east&quot;, Latin &quot;aurora&quot; &#x27;dawn&#x27;, and Greek &quot;ēōs&quot; &#x27;dawn, east&#x27;. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin oriens &#x27;east, sunrise&#x27; from orior &#x27;to rise, to originate&#x27;, Greek ανατολή anatolé &#x27;east&#x27; from ἀνατέλλω &#x27;to rise&#x27; and Hebrew מִזְרָח mizraḥ &#x27;east&#x27; from זָרַח zaraḥ &#x27;to rise, to shine&#x27;. &quot;Ēostre&quot;, a Germanic goddess of dawn, might have been a personification of both dawn and the cardinal points.

East is sometimes abbreviated as E.

== Navigation ==
By convention, the &quot;right-hand side&quot; of a map is east. This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north at the top. However, on maps of planets such as Venus and Uranus which rotate retrograde, the left hand side is east.

To go east using a compass for navigation, one sets a bearing or azimuth of 90°.

==Cultural==
East is the direction toward which the Earth rotates about its axis, and therefore the general direction from which the Sun appears to rise. The practice of praying towards the East is older than Christianity, but has been 
adopted by this religion as the Orient was thought of as containing mankind&#x27;s original home. Hence, Christian churches have been traditionally oriented towards the east. After some early exceptions, this tradition of having the altar on the liturgical east has become a part of the church orientation concept liturgical east and west.

The &quot;Orient&quot; is the &quot;East&quot;, traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the Eastern world, in relation to Europe. In English, it is largely a metonym for, and referring to the same area as, the continent of Asia, divided into the Far East, Middle East, and Near East. Despite this Eurocentric origin, these regions are still located to the east of the Geographical centre of Earth.

Within an individual city within the Northern Hemisphere, the east end is typically poorer because the prevailing winds blow from the west.

<doc id="61032" wikidata="Q938185" url="?curid=61032" title="Rationality">
<text>Rationality is the quality of being guided by or based on reason. In this regard, a person acts rationally if they have a good reason for what they do, or a belief is rational if it is based on strong evidence. This quality can apply to an ability, as in a rational animal, to a psychological process, like reasoning, to mental states, such as beliefs and intentions, or to persons who possess these other forms of rationality. A thing that lacks rationality is either &quot;arational&quot;, if it is outside the domain of rational evaluation, or &quot;irrational&quot;, if it belongs to this domain but does not fulfill its standards.

There are many discussions about the essential features shared by all forms of rationality. According to reason-responsiveness accounts, to be rational is to be responsive to reasons. For example, dark clouds are a reason for taking an umbrella, which is why it is rational for an agent to do so in response. An important rival to this approach are coherence-based accounts, which define rationality as internal coherence among the agent&#x27;s mental states. Many rules of coherence have been suggested in this regard, for example, that one should not hold contradictory beliefs or that one should intend to do something if one believes that one should do it. Goal-based accounts characterize rationality in relation to goals, such as acquiring truth in the case of theoretical rationality. Internalists believe that rationality depends only on the person&#x27;s mind. Externalists contend that external factors may also be relevant. Debates about the normativity of rationality concern the question of whether one should always be rational. A further discussion is whether rationality requires that all beliefs be reviewed from scratch rather than trusting pre-existing beliefs.

Various types of rationality are discussed in the academic literature. The most influential distinction is between theoretical and practical rationality. Theoretical rationality concerns the rationality of beliefs. Rational beliefs are based on evidence that supports them. Practical rationality pertains primarily to actions. This includes certain mental states and events preceding actions, like intentions and decisions. In some cases, the two can conflict, as when practical rationality requires that one adopts an irrational belief. Another distinction is between ideal rationality, which demands that rational agents obey all the laws and implications of logic, and bounded rationality, which takes into account that this is not always possible since the computational power of the human mind is too limited. Most academic discussions focus on the rationality of individuals. This contrasts with social or collective rationality, which pertains to collectives and their group beliefs and decisions.

Rationality is important for solving all kinds of problems in order to efficiently reach one&#x27;s goal. It is relevant to and discussed in many disciplines. In ethics, one question is whether one can be rational without being moral at the same time. Psychology is interested in how psychological processes implement rationality. This also includes the study of failures to do so, as in the case of cognitive biases. Cognitive and behavioral sciences usually assume that people are rational enough to predict how they think and act. Logic studies the laws of correct arguments. These laws are highly relevant to the rationality of beliefs. A very influential conception of practical rationality is given in decision theory, which states that a decision is rational if the chosen option has the highest expected utility. Other relevant fields include game theory, Bayesianism, economics, and artificial intelligence.

== Definition and semantic field ==
In its most common sense, rationality is the quality of being guided by reasons or being reasonable. For example, a person who acts rationally has good reasons for what they do. This usually implies that they reflected on the possible consequences of their action and the goal it is supposed to realize. In the case of beliefs, it is rational to believe something if the agent has good evidence for it and it is coherent with the agent&#x27;s other beliefs. While actions and beliefs are the most paradigmatic forms of rationality, the term is used both in ordinary language and in many academic disciplines to describe a wide variety of things, such as persons, desires, intentions, decisions, policies, and institutions. Because of this variety in different contexts, it has proven difficult to give a unified definition covering all these fields and usages. In this regard, different fields often focus their investigation on one specific conception, type, or aspect of rationality without trying to cover it in its most general sense.

These different forms of rationality are sometimes divided into abilities, processes, mental states, and persons. For example, when it is claimed that humans are rational animals, this usually refers to the ability to think and act in reasonable ways. It does not imply that all humans are rational all the time: this ability is exercised in some cases but not in others. On the other hand, the term can also refer to the process of reasoning that results from exercising this ability. Often many additional activities of the higher cognitive faculties are included as well, such as acquiring concepts, judging, deliberating, planning, and deciding as well as the formation of desires and intentions. These processes usually affect some kind of change in the thinker&#x27;s mental states. In this regard, one can also talk of the rationality of mental states, like beliefs and intentions. A person who possesses these forms of rationality to a sufficiently high degree may themselves be called &quot;rational&quot;. In some cases, also non-mental results of rational processes may qualify as rational. For example, the arrangement of products in a supermarket can be rational if it is based on a rational plan.

The term &quot;rational&quot; has two opposites: &quot;irrational&quot; and &quot;arational&quot;. Arational things are outside the domain of rational evaluation, like digestive processes or the weather. Things within the domain of rationality are either rational or irrational depending on whether they fulfill the standards of rationality. For example, beliefs, actions, or general policies are rational if there is a good reason for them and irrational otherwise. It is not clear in all cases what belongs to the domain of rational assessment. For example, there are disagreements about whether desires and emotions can be evaluated as rational and irrational rather than arational. The term &quot;irrational&quot; is sometimes used in a wide sense to include cases of arationality.

The meaning of the terms &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot; in academic discourse often differs from how they are used in everyday language. Examples of behaviors considered irrational in ordinary discourse are giving into temptations, going out late even though one has to get up early in the morning, smoking despite being aware of the health risks, or believing in astrology. In the academic discourse, on the other hand, rationality is usually identified with being guided by reasons or following norms of internal coherence. Some of the earlier examples may qualify as rational in the academic sense depending on the circumstances. Examples of irrationality in this sense include cognitive biases and violating the laws of probability theory when assessing the likelihood of future events. This article focuses mainly on irrationality in the academic sense.

The terms &quot;rationality&quot;, &quot;reason&quot;, and &quot;reasoning&quot; are frequently used as synonyms. But in technical contexts, their meanings are often distinguished. Reason is usually understood as the faculty responsible for the process of reasoning. This process aims at improving mental states. Reasoning tries to ensure that the norms of rationality obtain. It differs from rationality nonetheless since other psychological processes besides reasoning may have the same effect. Rationality derives etymologically from the Latin term &quot;&quot;.

==Disputes about the concept of rationality==
There are many disputes about the essential characteristics of rationality. It is often understood in relational terms: something, like a belief or an intention, is rational because of how it is related to something else. But there are disagreements as to what it has to be related to and in what way. For reason-based accounts, the relation to a reason that justifies or explains the rational state is central. For coherence-based accounts, the relation of coherence between mental states matters. There is a lively discussion in the contemporary literature on whether reason-based accounts or coherence-based accounts are superior. Some theorists also try to understand rationality in relation to the goals it tries to realize.

Other disputes in this field concern whether rationality depends only on the agent&#x27;s mind or also on external factors, whether rationality requires a review of all one&#x27;s beliefs from scratch, and whether we should always be rational.

=== Based on reason-responsiveness ===
A common idea of many theories of rationality is that it can be defined in terms of reasons. On this view, to be rational means to respond correctly to reasons. For example, the fact that a food is healthy is a reason to eat it. So this reason makes it rational for the agent to eat the food. An important aspect of this interpretation is that it is not sufficient to merely act accidentally in accordance with reasons. Instead, &quot;responding&quot; to reasons implies that one acts intentionally because of these reasons.

Some theorists understand reasons as external facts. This view has been criticized based on the claim that, in order to respond to reasons, people have to be aware of them, i.e. they have some form of epistemic access. But lacking this access is not automatically irrational. In one example by John Broome, the agent eats a fish contaminated with salmonella, which is a strong reason against eating the fish. But since the agent could not have known this fact, eating the fish is rational for them. Because of such problems, many theorists have opted for an internalist version of this account. This means that the agent does not need to respond to reasons in general, but only to reasons they have or possess. The success of such approaches depends a lot on what it means to have a reason and there are various disagreements on this issue. A common approach is to hold that this access is given through the possession of evidence in the form of cognitive mental states, like perceptions and knowledge. A similar version states that &quot;rationality consists in responding correctly to beliefs about reasons&quot;. So it is rational to bring an umbrella if the agent has strong evidence that it is going to rain. But without this evidence, it would be rational to leave the umbrella at home, even if, unbeknownst to the agent, it is going to rain. These versions avoid the previous objection since rationality no longer requires the agent to respond to external factors of which they could not have been aware.

A problem faced by all forms of reason-responsiveness theories is that there are usually many reasons relevant and some of them may conflict with each other. So while salmonella contamination is a reason against eating the fish, its good taste and the desire not to offend the host are reasons in favor of eating it. This problem is usually approached by weighing all the different reasons. This way, one does not respond directly to each reason individually but instead to their weighted sum. Cases of conflict are thus solved since one side usually outweighs the other. So despite the reasons cited in favor of eating the fish, the balance of reasons stands against it, since avoiding a salmonella infection is a much weightier reason than the other reasons cited. This can be expressed by stating that rational agents pick the option favored by the balance of reasons.

However, other objections to the reason-responsiveness account are not so easily solved. They often focus on cases where reasons require the agent to be irrational, leading to a rational dilemma. For example, if terrorists threaten to blow up a city unless the agent forms an irrational belief, this is a very weighty reason to do all in one&#x27;s power to violate the norms of rationality.

=== Based on rules of coherence ===
An influential rival to the reason-responsiveness account understands rationality as internal coherence. On this view, a person is rational to the extent that their mental states and actions are coherent with each other. Diverse versions of this approach exist that differ in how they understand coherence and what rules of coherence they propose. A general distinction in this regard is between negative and positive coherence. Negative coherence is an uncontroversial aspect of most such theories: it requires the absence of contradictions and inconsistencies. This means that the agent&#x27;s mental states do not clash with each other. In some cases, inconsistencies are rather obvious, as when a person believes that it will rain tomorrow and that it will not rain tomorrow. In complex cases, inconsistencies may be difficult to detect, for example, when a person believes in the axioms of Euclidean geometry and is nonetheless convinced that it is possible to square the circle. Positive coherence refers to the support that different mental states provide for each other. For example, there is positive coherence between the belief that there are eight planets in the solar system and the belief that there are less than ten planets in the solar system: the earlier belief implies the latter belief. Other types of support through positive coherence include explanatory and causal connections.

Coherence-based accounts are also referred to as rule-based accounts since the different aspects of coherence are often expressed in precise rules. In this regard, to be rational means to follow the rules of rationality in thought and action. According to the enkratic rule, for example, rational agents are required to intend what they believe they ought to do. This requires coherence between beliefs and intentions. The norm of persistence states that agents should retain their intentions over time. This way, earlier mental states cohere with later ones. It is also possible to distinguish different types of rationality, such as theoretical or practical rationality, based on the different sets of rules they require.

One problem with such coherence-based accounts of rationality is that the norms can enter into conflict with each other, so-called rational dilemmas. For example, if the agent has a pre-existing intention that turns out to conflict with their beliefs, then the enkratic norm requires them to change it, which is disallowed by the norm of persistence. This suggests that, in cases of rational dilemmas, it is impossible to be rational, no matter which norm is privileged. Some defenders of coherence theories of rationality have argued that, when formulated correctly, the norms of rationality cannot enter into conflict with each other. That means that rational dilemmas are impossible. This is sometimes tied to additional non-trivial assumptions, such that ethical dilemmas also do not exist. A different response is to bite the bullet and allow that rational dilemmas exist. This has the consequence that, in such cases, rationality is not possible for the agent and theories of rationality cannot offer guidance to them. These problems are avoided by reason-responsiveness accounts of rationality since they &quot;allow for rationality despite conflicting reasons but [coherence-based accounts] do not allow for rationality despite conflicting requirements&quot;. Some theorists suggest a weaker criterion of coherence to avoid cases of necessary irrationality: rationality requires not to obey all norms of coherence but to obey as many norms as possible. So in rational dilemmas, agents can still be rational if they violate the minimal number of rational requirements.

Another criticism rests on the claim that coherence-based accounts are either redundant or false. On this view, either the rules recommend the same option as the balance of reasons or a different option. If they recommend the same option, they are redundant. If they recommend a different option, they are false since, according to its critics, there is no special value in sticking to rules against the balance of reasons.

=== Based on goals ===
A different approach characterizes rationality in relation to the goals it aims to achieve. In this regard, theoretical rationality aims at epistemic goals, like acquiring truth and avoiding falsehood. Practical rationality, on the other hand, aims at non-epistemic goals, like moral, prudential, political, economic, or aesthetic goals. This is usually understood in the sense that rationality follows these goals but does not set them. So rationality may be understood as a &quot;minister without portfolio&quot; since it serves goals external to itself. This issue has been the source of an important historical discussion between David Hume and Immanuel Kant. The slogan of Hume&#x27;s position is that &quot;reason is the slave of the passions&quot;. This is often understood as the claim that rationality concerns only how to reach a goal but not whether the goal should be pursued at all. So people with perverse or weird goals may still be perfectly rational. This position is opposed by Kant, who argues that rationality requires having the right goals and motives.

According to William Frankena there are four conceptions of rationality based on the goals it tries to achieve. They correspond to egoism, utilitarianism, perfectionism, and intuitionism. According to the egoist perspective, rationality implies looking out for one&#x27;s own happiness. This contrasts with the utilitarian point of view, which states that rationality entails trying to contribute to everyone&#x27;s well-being or to the greatest general good. For perfectionism, a certain ideal of perfection, either moral or non-moral, is the goal of rationality. According to the intuitionist perspective, something is rational &quot;if and only if [it] conforms to self-evident truths, intuited by reason&quot;. These different perspectives diverge a lot concerning the behavior they prescribe. One problem for all of them is that they ignore the role of the evidence or information possessed by the agent. In this regard, it matters for rationality not just whether the agent acts efficiently towards a certain goal but also what information they have and how their actions appear reasonable from this perspective. Richard Brandt responds to this idea by proposing a conception of rationality based on relevant information: &quot;Rationality is a matter of what would survive scrutiny by all relevant information.&quot; This implies that the subject repeatedly reflects on all the relevant facts, including formal facts like the laws of logic.

=== Internalism and externalism ===
An important contemporary discussion in the field of rationality is between internalists and externalists. Both sides agree that rationality demands and depends in some sense on reasons. They disagree on what reasons are relevant or how to conceive those reasons. Internalists understand reasons as mental states, for example, as perceptions, beliefs, or desires. On this view, an action may be rational because it is in tune with the agent&#x27;s beliefs and realizes their desires. Externalists, on the other hand, see reasons as external factors about what is good or right. They state that whether an action is rational also depends on its actual consequences. The difference between the two positions is that internalists affirm and externalists reject the claim that rationality supervenes on the mind. This claim means that it only depends on the person&#x27;s mind whether they are rational and not on external factors. So for internalism, two persons with the same mental states would both have the same degree of rationality independent of how different their external situation is. Because of this limitation, rationality can diverge from actuality. So if the agent has a lot of misleading evidence, it may be rational for them to turn left even though the actually correct path goes right.

Bernard Williams has criticized externalist conceptions of rationality based on the claim that rationality should help explain what motivates the agent to act. This is easy for internalism but difficult for externalism since external reasons can be independent of the agent&#x27;s motivation. Externalists have responded to this objection by distinguishing between motivational and normative reasons. Motivational reasons explain why someone acts the way they do while normative reasons explain why someone ought to act in a certain way. Ideally, the two overlap, but they can come apart. For example, liking chocolate cake is a motivational reason for eating it while having high blood pressure is a normative reason for not eating it. The problem of rationality is primarily concerned with normative reasons. This is especially true for various contemporary philosophers who hold that rationality can be reduced to normative reasons. The distinction between motivational and normative reasons is usually accepted, but many theorists have raised doubts that rationality can be identified with normativity. On this view, rationality may sometimes recommend suboptimal actions, for example, because the agent lacks important information or has false information. In this regard, discussions between internalism and externalism overlap with discussions of the normativity of rationality.

==== Relativity ====
An important implication of internalist conceptions is that rationality is relative to the person&#x27;s perspective or mental states. Whether a belief or an action is rational usually depends on which mental states the person has. So carrying an umbrella for the walk to the supermarket is rational for a person believing that it will rain but irrational for another person who lacks this belief. According to Robert Audi, this can be explained in terms of experience: what is rational depends on the agent&#x27;s experience. Since different people make different experiences, there are differences in what is rational for them.

=== Normativity ===
Rationality is normative in the sense that it sets up certain rules or standards of correctness: to be rational is to comply with certain requirements. For example, rationality requires that the agent does not have contradictory beliefs. Many discussions on this issue concern the question of what exactly these standards are. Some theorists characterize the normativity of rationality in the deontological terms of obligations and permissions. Others understand them from an evaluative perspective as good or valuable. A further approach is to talk of rationality based on what is praise- and blameworthy. It is important to distinguish the norms of rationality from other types of norms. For example, some forms of fashion prescribe that men do not wear bell-bottom trousers. Understood in the strongest sense, a norm prescribes what an agent ought to do or what they have most reason to do. The norms of fashion are not norms in this strong sense: that it is unfashionable does not mean that men ought not to wear bell-bottom trousers. 

Most discussions of the normativity of rationality are interested in the strong sense, i.e. whether agents ought always to be rational. This is sometimes termed a substantive account of rationality in contrast to structural accounts. One important argument in favor of the normativity of rationality is based on considerations of praise- and blameworthiness. It states that we usually hold each other responsible for being rational and criticize each other when we fail to do so. This practice indicates that irrationality is some form of fault on the side of the subject that should not be the case. A strong counterexample to this position is due to John Broome, who considers the case of a fish an agent wants to eat. It contains salmonella, which is a decisive reason why the agent ought not to eat it. But the agent is unaware of this fact, which is why it is rational for them to eat the fish. So this would be a case where normativity and rationality come apart. This example can be generalized in the sense that rationality only depends on the reasons accessible to the agent or how things appear to them. What one ought to do, on the other hand, is determined by objectively existing reasons. In the ideal case, rationality and normativity may coincide but they come apart either if the agent lacks access to a reason or if he has a mistaken belief about the presence of a reason. These considerations are summed up in the statement that rationality supervenes only on the agent&#x27;s mind but normativity does not.

But there are also thought experiments in favor of the normativity of rationality. One, due to Frank Jackson, involves a doctor who receives a patient with a mild condition and has to prescribe one out of three drugs: drug A resulting in a partial cure, drug B resulting in a complete cure, or drug C resulting in the patient&#x27;s death. The doctor&#x27;s problem is that they cannot tell which of the drugs B and C results in a complete cure and which one in the patient&#x27;s death. The objectively best case would be for the patient to get drug B, but it would be highly irresponsible for the doctor to prescribe it given the uncertainty about its effects. So the doctor ought to prescribe the less effective drug A, which is also the rational choice. This thought experiment indicates that rationality and normativity coincide since what is rational and what one ought to do depends on the agent&#x27;s mind after all.

Some theorists have responded to these thought experiments by distinguishing between normativity and responsibility. On this view, critique of irrational behavior, like the doctor prescribing drug B, involves a negative evaluation of the agent in terms of responsibility but remains silent on normative issues. On a competence-based account, which defines rationality in terms of the competence of responding to reasons, such behavior can be understood as a failure to execute one&#x27;s competence. But sometimes we are lucky and we succeed in the normative dimension despite failing to perform competently, i.e. rationally, due to being irresponsible. The opposite can also be the case: bad luck may result in failure despite a responsible, competent performance. This explains how rationality and normativity can come apart despite our practice of criticizing irrationality.

==== Normative and descriptive theories ====
The concept of normativity can also be used to distinguish different theories of rationality. Normative theories explore the normative nature of rationality. They are concerned with rules and ideals that govern how the mind should work. Descriptive theories, on the other hand, investigate how the mind actually works. This includes issues like under which circumstances the ideal rules are followed as well as studying the underlying psychological processes responsible for rational thought. Descriptive theories are often investigated in empirical psychology while philosophy tends to focus more on normative issues. This division also reflects how different these two types are investigated.

Descriptive and normative theorists usually employ different methodologies in their research. Descriptive issues are studied by empirical research. This can take the form of studies that present their participants with a cognitive problem. It is then observed how the participants solve the problem, possibly together with explanations of why they arrived at a specific solution. Normative issues, on the other hand, are usually investigated in similar ways to how the formal sciences conduct their inquiry. In the field of theoretical rationality, for example, it is accepted that deductive reasoning in the form of modus ponens leads to rational beliefs. This claim can be investigated using methods like rational intuition or careful deliberation toward a reflective equilibrium. These forms of investigation can arrive at conclusions about what forms of thought are rational and irrational without depending on empirical evidence.

An important question in this field concerns the relation between descriptive and normative approaches to rationality. One difficulty in this regard is that there is in many cases a huge gap between what the norms of ideal rationality prescribe and how people actually reason. Examples of normative systems of rationality are classical logic, probability theory, and decision theory. Actual reasoners often diverge from these standards because of cognitive biases, heuristics, or other mental limitations.

Traditionally, it was often assumed that actual human reasoning should follow the rules described in normative theories. On this view, any discrepancy is a form of irrationality that should be avoided. However, this usually ignores the human limitations of the mind. Given these limitations, various discrepancies may be necessary (and in this sense &quot;rational&quot;) to get the most useful results. For example, the ideal rational norms of decision theory demand that the agent should always choose the option with the highest expected value. However, calculating the expected value of each option may take a very long time in complex situations and may not be worth the trouble. This is reflected in the fact that actual reasoners often settle for an option that is good enough without making certain that it is really the best option available. A further difficulty in this regard is Hume&#x27;s law, which states that one cannot deduce what ought to be based on what is. So just because a certain heuristic or cognitive bias is present in a specific case, it should not be inferred that it should be present. One approach to these problems is to hold that descriptive and normative theories talk about different types of rationality. This way, there is no contradiction between the two and both can be correct in their own field. Similar problems are discussed in so-called naturalized epistemology.

=== Conservatism and foundationalism ===
Rationality is usually understood as conservative in the sense that rational agents do not start from zero but already possess many beliefs and intentions. Reasoning takes place on the background of these pre-existing mental states and tries to improve them. This way, the original beliefs and intentions are privileged: one keeps them unless a reason to doubt them is encountered. Some forms of epistemic foundationalism reject this approach. According to them, the whole system of beliefs is to be justified by self-evident beliefs. Examples of such self-evident beliefs may include immediate experiences as well as simple logical and mathematical axioms.

An important difference between conservatism and foundationalism concerns their differing conceptions of the burden of proof. According to conservativism, the burden of proof is always in favor of already established belief: in the absence of new evidence, it is rational to keep the mental states one already has. According to foundationalism, the burden of proof is always in favor of suspending mental states. For example, the agent reflects on their pre-existing belief that the Taj Mahal is in Agra but is unable to access any reason for or against this belief. In this case, conservatists think it is rational to keep this belief while foundationalists reject it as irrational due to the lack of reasons. In this regard, conservatism is much closer to the ordinary conception of rationality. One problem for foundationalism is that very few beliefs, if any, would remain if this approach was carried out meticulously. Another is that enormous mental resources would be required to constantly keep track of all the justificatory relations connecting non-fundamental beliefs to fundamental ones.

== Types ==
Rationality is discussed in a great variety of fields, often in very different terms. While some theorists try to provide a unifying conception expressing the features shared by all forms of rationality, the more common approach is to articulate the different aspects of the individual forms of rationality. The most common distinction is between theoretical and practical rationality. Other classifications include categories for ideal and bounded rationality as well as for individual and social rationality.

=== Theoretical and practical ===
The most influential distinction contrasts theoretical or epistemic rationality with practical rationality. Its theoretical side concerns the rationality of beliefs: whether it is rational to hold a given belief and how certain one should be about it. Practical rationality, on the other hand, is about the rationality of actions, intentions, and decisions. This corresponds to the distinction between theoretical reasoning and practical reasoning: theoretical reasoning tries to assess whether the agent should change their beliefs while practical reasoning tries to assess whether the agent should change their plans and intentions.

==== Theoretical ====
Theoretical rationality concerns the rationality of cognitive mental states, in particular, of beliefs. It is common to distinguish between two factors. The first factor is about the fact that good reasons are necessary for a belief to be rational. This is usually understood in terms of evidence provided by the so-called sources of knowledge, i.e. faculties like perception, introspection, and memory. In this regard, it is often argued that to be rational, the believer has to respond to the impressions or reasons presented by these sources. For example, the visual impression of the sunlight on a tree makes it rational to believe that the sun is shining. In this regard, it may also be relevant whether the formed belief is involuntary and implicit 

The second factor pertains to the norms and procedures of rationality that govern how agents should form beliefs based on this evidence. These norms include the rules of inference discussed in regular logic as well as other norms of coherence between mental states. In the case of rules of inference, the premises of a valid argument offer support to the conclusion and make therefore the belief in the conclusion rational. The support offered by the premises can either be deductive or non-deductive. In both cases, believing in the premises of an argument makes it rational to also believe in its conclusion. The difference between the two is given by how the premises support the conclusion. For deductive reasoning, the premises offer the strongest possible support: it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. The premises of non-deductive arguments also offer support for their conclusion. But this support is not absolute: the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the premises make it more likely that the conclusion is true. In this case, it is usually demanded that the non-deductive support is sufficiently strong if the belief in the conclusion is to be rational. 

An important form of theoretical irrationality is motivationally biased belief, sometimes referred to as wishful thinking. In this case, beliefs are formed based on one&#x27;s desires or what is pleasing to imagine without proper evidential support. Faulty reasoning in the form of formal and informal fallacies is another cause of theoretical irrationality.

==== Practical ====
All forms of practical rationality are concerned with how we act. It pertains both to actions directly as well as to mental states and events preceding actions, like intentions and decisions. There are various aspects of practical rationality, such as how to pick a goal to follow and how to choose the means for reaching this goal. Other issues include the coherence between different intentions as well as between beliefs and intentions.

Some theorists define the rationality of actions in terms of beliefs and desires. On this view, an action to bring about a certain goal is rational if the agent has the desire to bring about this goal and the belief that their action will realize it. A stronger version of this view requires that the responsible beliefs and desires are rational themselves. A very influential conception of the rationality of decisions comes from decision theory. In decisions, the agent is presented with a set of possible courses of action and has to choose one among them. Decision theory holds that the agent should choose the alternative that has the highest expected value. Practical rationality includes the field of actions but not of behavior in general. The difference between the two is that actions are intentional behavior, i.e. they are performed for a purpose and guided by it. In this regard, intentional behavior like driving a car is either rational or irrational while non-intentional behavior like sneezing is outside the domain of rationality.

For various other practical phenomena, there is no clear consensus on whether they belong to this domain or not. For example, concerning the rationality of desires, two important theories are proceduralism and substantivism. According to proceduralism, there is an important distinction between instrumental and noninstrumental desires. A desire is instrumental if its fulfillment serves as a means to the fulfillment of another desire. For example, Jack is sick and wants to take medicine to get healthy again. In this case, the desire to take the medicine is instrumental since it only serves as a means to Jack&#x27;s noninstrumental desire to get healthy. Both proceduralism and substantivism usually agree that a person can be irrational if they lack an instrumental desire despite having the corresponding noninstrumental desire and being aware that it acts as a means. Proceduralists hold that this is the only way a desire can be irrational. Substantivists, on the other hand, allow that noninstrumental desires may also be irrational. In this regard, a substantivist could claim that it would be irrational for Jack to lack his noninstrumental desire to be healthy. Similar debates focus on the rationality of emotions.

==== Relation between the two ====
Theoretical and practical rationality are often discussed separately and there are many differences between them. In some cases, they even conflict with each other. However, there are also various ways in which they overlap and depend on each other.

It is sometimes claimed that theoretical rationality aims at truth while practical rationality aims at goodness. According to John Searle, the difference can be expressed in terms of &quot;direction of fit&quot;. On this view, theoretical rationality is about how the mind corresponds to the world by representing it. Practical rationality, on the other hand, is about how the world corresponds to the ideal set up by the mind and how it should be changed. Another difference is that arbitrary choices are sometimes needed for practical rationality. For example, there may be two equally good routes available to reach a goal. On the practical level, one has to choose one of them if one wants to reach the goal. It would even be practically irrational to resist this arbitrary choice, as exemplified by Buridan&#x27;s ass. But on the theoretical level, one does not have to form a belief about which route was taken upon hearing that someone reached the goal. In this case, the arbitrary choice for one belief rather than the other would be theoretically irrational. Instead, the agent should suspend their belief either way if they lack sufficient reasons. Another difference is that practical rationality is guided by specific goals and desires, in contrast to theoretical rationality. So it is practically rational to take medicine if one has the desire to cure a sickness. But it is theoretically irrational to adopt the belief that one is healthy just because one desires this. This is a form of wishful thinking.

In some cases, the demands of practical and theoretical rationality conflict with each other. For example, the practical reason of loyalty to one&#x27;s child may demand the belief that they are innocent while the evidence linking them to the crime may demand a belief in their guilt on the theoretical level.

But the two domains also overlap in certain ways. For example, the norm of rationality known as enkrasia links beliefs and intentions. It states that &quot;[r]ationality requires of you that you intend to F if you believe your reasons require you to F&quot;. Failing to fulfill this requirement results in cases of irrationality known as akrasia or weakness of the will. Another form of overlap is that the study of the rules governing practical rationality is a theoretical matter. And practical considerations may determine whether to pursue theoretical rationality on a certain issue as well as how much time and resources to invest in the inquiry. It is often held that practical rationality presupposes theoretical rationality. This is based on the idea that to decide what should be done, one needs to know what is the case. But one can assess what is the case independently of knowing what should be done. So in this regard, one can study theoretical rationality as a distinct discipline independent of practical rationality but not the other way round. However, this independence is rejected by some forms of doxastic voluntarism. They hold that theoretical rationality can be understood as one type of practical rationality. This is based on the controversial claim that we can decide what to believe. It can take the form of &quot;epistemic decision theory&quot;, which states that people try to fulfill epistemic aims when deciding what to believe. A similar idea is defended by Jesús Mosterín. He argues that the proper object of rationality is not &quot;belief&quot; but &quot;acceptance&quot;. He understands acceptance as a voluntary and context-dependent decision to affirm a proposition.

=== Ideal and bounded ===
Various theories of rationality assume some form of ideal rationality, for example, by demanding that rational agents obey all the laws and implications of logic. This can include the requirement that if the agent believes a proposition, they should also believe in everything that logically follows from this proposition. However, many theorists reject this form of logical omniscience as a requirement for rationality. They argue that, since the human mind is limited, rationality has to be defined accordingly to account for how actual finite humans possess some form of resource-limited rationality.

According to the position of bounded rationality, theories of rationality should take into account cognitive limitations, such as incomplete knowledge, imperfect memory, and limited capacities of computation and representation. An important research question in this field is about how cognitive agents use heuristics rather than brute calculations to solve problems and make decisions. According to the satisficing heuristic, for example, agents usually stop their search for the best option once an option is found that meets their desired achievement level. In this regard, people often do not continue to search for the best possible option, even though this is what theories of ideal rationality commonly demand. Using heuristics can be highly rational as a way to adapt to the limitations of the human mind, especially in complex cases where these limitations make brute calculations impossible or very time- and resource-intensive.

=== Individual and social ===
Most discussions and research in the academic literature focus on individual rationality. This concerns the rationality of individual persons, for example, whether their beliefs and actions are rational. But the question of rationality can also be applied to groups as a whole on the social level. This form of social or collective rationality concerns both theoretical and practical issues like group beliefs and group decisions. And just like in the individual case, it is possible to study these phenomena as well as the processes and structures that are responsible for them. On the social level, there are various forms of cooperation to reach a shared goal. In the theoretical cases, a group of jurors may first discuss and then vote to determine whether the defendant is guilty. Or in the practical case, politicians may cooperate to implement new regulations to combat climate change. These forms of cooperation can be judged on their social rationality depending on how they are implemented and on the quality of the results they bear. Some theorists try to reduce social rationality to individual rationality by holding that the group processes are rational to the extent that the individuals participating in them are rational. But such a reduction is frequently rejected.

Various studies indicate that group rationality often outperforms individual rationality. For example, groups of people working together on the Wason selection task usually perform better than individuals by themselves. This form of group superiority is sometimes termed &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot; and may be explained based on the claim that competent individuals have a stronger impact on the group decision than others. However, this is not always the case and sometimes groups perform worse due to conformity or unwillingness to bring up controversial issues.

=== Others ===
Many other classifications are discussed in the academic literature. One important distinction is between approaches to rationality based on the output or on the process. Process-oriented theories of rationality are common in cognitive psychology and study how cognitive systems process inputs to generate outputs. Output-oriented approaches are more common in philosophy and investigate the rationality of the resulting states. Another distinction is between relative and categorical judgments of rationality. In the relative case, rationality is judged based on limited information or evidence while categorical judgments take all the evidence into account and are thus judgments &quot;all things considered&quot;. For example, believing that one&#x27;s investments will multiply can be rational in a relative sense because it is based on one&#x27;s astrological horoscope. But this belief is irrational in a categorical sense if the belief in astrology is itself irrational.

== Importance ==
Rationality is central to solving many problems, both on the local and the global scale. This is often based on the idea that rationality is necessary to act efficiently and to reach all kinds of goals. This includes goals from diverse fields, such as ethical goals, humanist goals, scientific goals, and even religious goals. The study of rationality is very old and has occupied many of the greatest minds since ancient Greek. This interest is often motivated by discovering the potentials and limitations of our minds. Various theorists even see rationality as the essence of being human, often in an attempt to distinguish humans from other animals. However, this strong affirmation has been subjected to many criticisms, for example, that humans are not rational all the time and that non-human animals also show diverse forms of intelligence.

The topic of rationality is relevant to a variety of disciplines. It plays a central role in philosophy, psychology, Bayesianism, decision theory, and game theory. But it is also covered in other disciplines, such as artificial intelligence, behavioral economics, microeconomics, and neuroscience. Some forms of research restrict themselves to one specific domain while others investigate the topic in an interdisciplinary manner by drawing insights from different fields. 

== Paradoxes of rationality ==
The term &quot;paradox of rationality&quot; has a variety of meanings. It is often used for puzzles or unsolved problems of rationality. Some are just situations where it is not clear what the rational person should do. Others involve apparent faults within rationality itself, for example, where rationality seems to recommend a suboptimal course of action. A special case are so-called rational dilemmas, in which it is impossible to be rational since two norms of rationality conflict with each other. Examples of paradoxes of rationality include Pascal&#x27;s Wager, the Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, Buridan&#x27;s ass, and the St. Petersburg paradox.

==History==
===Max Weber===
The German scholar Max Weber proposed an interpretation of social action that distinguished between four different idealized types of rationality.

The first, which he called &quot;Zweckrational&quot; or purposive/instrumental rationality, is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were &quot;rationally pursued and calculated.&quot; The second type, Weber called &quot;Wertrational&quot; or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motives, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor&#x27;s specific affect, feeling, or emotion—to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered &quot;meaningfully oriented.&quot; The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.

The advantage in Weber&#x27;s interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that ground or motive can be given—for religious or affect reasons, for example—that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the &quot;Zweckrational&quot; orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are &quot;Wertrational&quot;.

Weber&#x27;s constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a Habermasian (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power) and also from a feminist perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber&#x27;s rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power. An alternative position on rationality (which includes both bounded rationality, as well as the affective and value-based arguments of Weber) can be found in the critique of Etzioni (1988), who reframes thought on decision-making to argue for a reversal of the position put forward by Weber. Etzioni illustrates how purposive/instrumental reasoning is subordinated by normative considerations (ideas on how people &#x27;ought&#x27; to behave) and affective considerations (as a support system for the development of human relationships).

===Richard Brandt===
Richard Brandt proposed a &quot;reforming definition&quot; of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of cognitive-psychotherapy.

===Robert Audi===
Robert Audi developed a comprehensive account of rationality that covers both the theoretical and the practical side of rationality. This account centers on the notion of a &quot;ground&quot;: a mental state is rational if it is &quot;well-grounded&quot; in a source of justification. Irrational mental states, on the other hand, lack a sufficient ground. For example, the perceptual experience of a tree when looking outside the window can ground the rationality of the belief that there is a tree outside.

Audi is committed to a form of foundationalism: the idea that justified beliefs, or in his case, rational states in general, can be divided into two groups: the &quot;foundation&quot; and the &quot;superstructure&quot;. The mental states in the superstructure receive their justification from other rational mental states while the foundational mental states receive their justification from a more basic source. For example, the above-mentioned belief that there is a tree outside is foundational since it is based on a basic source: perception. Knowing that trees grow in soil, we may deduce that there is soil outside. This belief is equally rational, being supported by an adequate ground, but it belongs to the superstructure since its rationality is grounded in the rationality of another belief. Desires, like beliefs, form a hierarchy: intrinsic desires are at the foundation while instrumental desires belong to the superstructure. In order to link the instrumental desire to the intrinsic desire an extra element is needed: a belief that the fulfillment of the instrumental desire is a means to the fulfillment of the intrinsic desire.

Audi asserts that all the basic sources providing justification for the foundational mental states come from experience. As for &quot;beliefs&quot;, there are four types of experience that act as sources: perception, memory, introspection, and rational intuition. The main basic source of the rationality of &quot;desires&quot;, on the other hand, comes in the form of hedonic experience: the experience of pleasure and pain. So, for example, a desire to eat ice-cream is rational if it is based on experiences in which the agent enjoyed the taste of ice-cream, and irrational if it lacks such a support. Because of its dependence on experience, rationality can be defined as a kind of responsiveness to experience.

&quot;Actions&quot;, in contrast to beliefs and desires, do not have a source of justification of their own. Their rationality is grounded in the rationality of other states instead: in the rationality of beliefs and desires. Desires motivate actions. Beliefs are needed here, as in the case of instrumental desires, to bridge a gap and link two elements. Audi distinguishes the &quot;focal&quot; rationality of individual mental states from the &quot;global&quot; rationality of &quot;persons&quot;. Global rationality has a derivative status: it depends on the focal rationality. Or more precisely: &quot;Global rationality is reached when a person has a sufficiently integrated system of sufficiently well-grounded propositional attitudes, emotions, and actions&quot;. Rationality is &quot;relative&quot; in the sense that it depends on the experience of the person in question. Since different people undergo different experiences, what is rational to believe for one person may be irrational to believe for another person. That a belief is rational does not entail that it is &quot;true&quot;.

==In various fields==
=== Ethics and morality ===
The problem of rationality is relevant to various issues in ethics and morality. Many debates center around the question of whether rationality implies morality or is possible without it. Some examples based on common sense suggest that the two can come apart. For example, some immoral psychopaths are highly intelligent in the pursuit of their schemes and may, therefore, be seen as rational. However, there are also considerations suggesting that the two are closely related to each other. For example, according to the principle of universality, &quot;one&#x27;s reasons for acting are acceptable only if it is acceptable that everyone acts on such reasons&quot;. A similar formulation is given in Immanuel Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative: &quot;act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law&quot;. The principle of universality has been suggested as a basic principle both for morality and for rationality. This is closely related to the question of whether agents have a duty to be rational. Another issue concerns the value of rationality. In this regard, it is often held that human lives are more important than animal lives because humans are rational.

===Psychology===
Many psychological theories have been proposed to describe how reasoning happens and what underlying psychological processes are responsible. One of their goals is to explain how the different types of irrationality happen and why some types are more prevalent than others. They include &quot;mental logic theories&quot;, &quot;mental model theories&quot;, and &quot;dual process theories&quot;. An important psychological area of study focuses on cognitive biases. Cognitive biases are systematic tendencies to engage in erroneous or irrational forms of thinking, judging, and acting. Examples include the confirmation bias, the self-serving bias, the hindsight bias, and the Dunning–Kruger effect. Some empirical findings suggest that metacognition is an important aspect of rationality. The idea behind this claim is that reasoning is carried out more efficiently and reliably if the responsible thought processes are properly controlled and monitored.

The Wason selection task is an influential test for studying rationality and reasoning abilities. In it, four cards are placed before the participants. Each has a number on one side and a letter on the opposite side. In one case, the visible sides of the four cards are A, D, 4, and 7. The participant is then asked which cards need to be turned around in order to verify the conditional claim &quot;if there is a vowel on one side of the card, then there is an even number on the other side of the card&quot;. The correct answer is A and 7. But this answer is only given by about 10%. Many choose card 4 instead even though there is no requirement on what letters may appear on its opposite side. An important insight from using these and similar tests is that the rational ability of the participants is usually significantly better for concrete and realistic cases than for abstract or implausible cases. Various contemporary studies in this field use Bayesian probability theory to study subjective degrees of belief, for example, how the believer&#x27;s certainty in the premises is carried over to the conclusion through reasoning.

In the psychology of reasoning, psychologists and cognitive scientists have defended different positions on human rationality. One prominent view, due to Philip Johnson-Laird and Ruth M. J. Byrne among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors. However, it has been argued that many standard tests of reasoning, such as those on the conjunction fallacy, on the Wason selection task, or the base rate fallacy suffer from methodological and conceptual problems. This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as Gerd Gigerenzer, favor a conception of bounded rationality, especially for tasks under high uncertainty. The concept of rationality continues to be debated by psychologists, economists and cognitive scientists.

The psychologist Jean Piaget gave an influential account of how the stages in human development from childhood to adulthood can be understood in terms of the increase of rational and logical abilities. He identifies four stages associated with rough age groups: the sensorimotor stage below the age of two, the preoperational state until the age of seven, the concrete operational stage until the age of eleven, and the formal operational stage afterward. Rational or logical reasoning only takes place in the last stage and is related to abstract thinking, concept formation, reasoning, planning, and problem-solving.

====Emotions====
According to A. C. Grayling, rationality &quot;must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts&quot;. Certain findings in cognitive science and neuroscience show that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example, an individual with a massively damaged amygdala or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. In his book, &quot;The Edge of Reason: A Rational Skeptic in an Irrational World,&quot; British philosopher Julian Baggini sets out to debunk myths about reason (e.g., that it is &quot;purely objective and requires no subjective judgment&quot;).

=== Cognitive and behavioral sciences ===
Cognitive and behavioral sciences try to describe, explain, and predict how people think and act. Their models are often based on the assumption that people are rational. For example, classical economics is based on the assumption that people are rational agents that maximize expected utility. However, people often depart from the ideal standards of rationality in various ways. For example, they may only look for confirming evidence and ignore disconfirming evidence. Another factor studied in this regard are the limitations of human intellectual capacities. Many discrepancies from rationality are caused by limited time, memory, or attention. Often heuristics and rules of thumb are used to mitigate these limitations, but they may lead to new forms of irrationality.

===Logic===

Theoretical rationality is closely related to logic, but not identical to it. Logic is often defined as the study of correct arguments. This concerns the relation between the propositions used in the argument: whether its premises offer support to its conclusion. Theoretical rationality, on the other hand, is about what to believe or how to change one&#x27;s beliefs. The laws of logic are relevant to rationality since the agent should change their beliefs if they violate these laws. But logic is not directly about what to believe. Additionally, there are also other factors and norms besides logic that determine whether it is rational to hold or change a belief. The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.

=== Decision theory ===
An influential account of practical rationality is given by decision theory. Decisions are situations where a number of possible courses of action are available to the agent, who has to choose one of them. Decision theory investigates the rules governing which action should be chosen. It assumes that each action may lead to a variety of outcomes. Each outcome is associated with a conditional probability and a utility. The &quot;expected gain&quot; of an outcome can be calculated by multiplying its conditional probability with its utility. the &quot;expected utility&quot; of an act is equivalent to the sum of all expected gains of the outcomes associated with it. From these basic ingredients, it is possible to define the rationality of decisions: a decision is rational if it selects the act with the highest expected utility. While decision theory gives a very precise formal treatment of this issue, it leaves open the empirical problem of how to assign utilities and probabilities. So decision theory can still lead to bad empirical decisions if it is based on poor assignments.

According to decision theorists, rationality is primarily a matter of internal consistency. This means that a person&#x27;s mental states like beliefs and preferences are consistent with each other or do not go against each other. One consequence of this position is that people with obviously false beliefs or perverse preferences may still count as rational if these mental states are consistent with their other mental states. Utility is often understood in terms of self-interest or personal preferences. However, this is not a necessary aspect of decisions theory and it can also be interpreted in terms of goodness or value in general.

=== Game theory ===
Game theory is closely related to decision theory and the problem of rational choice. Rational choice is based on the idea that rational agents perform a cost-benefit analysis of all available options and choose the option that is most beneficial from their point of view. In the case of game theory, several agents are involved. This further complicates the situation since whether a given option is the best choice for one agent may depend on choices made by other agents. Game theory can be used to analyze various situations, like playing chess, firms competing for business, or animals fighting over prey. Rationality is a core assumption of game theory: it is assumed that each player chooses rationally based on what is most beneficial from their point of view. This way, the agent may be able to anticipate how others choose and what their best choice is relative to the behavior of the others. This often results in a Nash equilibrium, which constitutes a set of strategies, one for each player, where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.

=== Bayesianism ===
A popular contemporary approach to rationality is based on Bayesian epistemology. Bayesian epistemology sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in degrees. For example, Daniel is relatively sure that the Boston Celtics will win their next match and absolutely certain that two plus two equals four. In this case, the degree of the first belief is weaker than the degree of the second belief. These degrees are usually referred to as &quot;credences&quot; and represented by numbers between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to full disbelief, 1 corresponds to full belief and 0.5 corresponds to suspension of belief. Bayesians understand this in terms of probability: the higher the credence, the higher the subjective probability that the believed proposition is true. As probabilities, they are subject to the laws of probability theory. These laws act as norms of rationality: beliefs are rational if they comply with them and irrational if they violate them. For example, it would be irrational to have a credence of 0.9 that it will rain tomorrow together with another credence of 0.9 that it will not rain tomorrow. This account of rationality can also be extended to the practical domain by requiring that agents maximize their subjective expected utility. This way, Bayesianism can provide a unified account of both theoretical and practical rationality.

===Economics===
Rationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this. Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality—basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational—that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information—in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that do not fully use the information they have.

Debates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are &quot;really&quot; rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of bounded rationality makes more sense for such models.

Others think that any kind of rationality along the lines of rational choice theory is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term &quot;homo economicus&quot; (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is logically consistent but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view. Behavioral economics aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.

===Artificial intelligence===
The field of artificial intelligence is concerned, among other things, with how problems of rationality can be implemented and solved by computers. Within artificial intelligence, a &quot;rational agent&quot; is typically one that maximizes its expected utility, given its current knowledge. Utility is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of &quot;performance&quot;, which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the psychology of reasoning.

===International relations===
There is an ongoing debate over the merits of using &quot;rationality&quot; in the study of international relations (IR). Some scholars hold it indispensable. Others are more critical. Still, the pervasive and persistent usage of &quot;rationality&quot; in political science and IR is beyond dispute. &quot;Rationality&quot; remains ubiquitous in this field. Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to &quot;foreign policy&quot; allude to &quot;rationality&quot;—and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on &quot;malpractice&quot;: rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of &quot;rationality&quot; they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between &quot;us and them.&quot;

==Criticism==
The concept of rationality has been subject to criticism by various philosophers who question its universality and capacity to provide a comprehensive understanding of reality and human existence.

Friedrich Nietzsche, in his work &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; (1886), criticized the overemphasis on rationality and argued that it neglects the irrational and instinctual aspects of human nature. Nietzsche advocated for a reevaluation of values based on individual perspectives and the will to power, stating, &quot;There are no facts, only interpretations.&quot;

Martin Heidegger, in &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927), offered a critique of the instrumental and calculative view of reason, emphasizing the primacy of our everyday practical engagement with the world. Heidegger challenged the notion that rationality alone is the sole arbiter of truth and understanding.

Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, in their seminal work &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; (1947), questioned the Enlightenment&#x27;s rationality. They argued that the dominance of instrumental reason in modern society leads to the domination of nature and the dehumanization of individuals. Horkheimer and Adorno highlighted how rationality narrows the scope of human experience and hinders critical thinking.

Michel Foucault, in &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Birth of Biopolitics&quot; (1978), critiqued the notion of rationality as a neutral and objective force. Foucault emphasized the intertwining of rationality with power structures and its role in social control. He famously stated, &quot;Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.&quot;

These philosophers&#x27; critiques of rationality shed light on its limitations, assumptions, and potential dangers. Their ideas challenge the universal application of rationality as the sole framework for understanding the complexities of human existence and the world.

<text>James Phillip Rome (born October 14, 1964) is an American sports radio host. His talk show, &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot;, is syndicated by Westwood One.

Broadcasting from a studio near Los Angeles, California, Rome hosts &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot; on radio. He hosted TV shows on ESPN, TSN2 (in Canada), Showtime and CBS, but since 2024 has streamed on X. He has also formed a free, ad-supported streaming channel.

For a number of years Rome hosted a television show &quot;Jim Rome Is Burning&quot; (formerly &quot;Rome Is Burning&quot;), which aired on ESPN in the United States and TSN2 in Canada. In 2011, Rome ended his relationship with ESPN to join the CBS network where he hosts his own show, as well as an interview-format show on the Showtime channel. His past hosting jobs included sports discussion television shows &quot;Talk2&quot; (ESPN2), &quot;The FX Sports Show&quot; (FX), and &quot;The Last Word&quot; (Fox Sports Net). The Jim Rome Show is tied for the #21 most listened to talk radio show in the United States and Rome is the #29 most influential talk radio personality according to &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot;.

From April 2012 to March 2015, Rome had a television sports talk show on CBS Sports Network named &quot;Rome&quot;. During the same time period he had a monthly TV sports/entertainment talk show on Showtime named &quot;Jim Rome on Showtime&quot;.

==Personal life==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Rome graduated from Calabasas High School in 1982 and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) with a degree in Communications in 1987. He lives in Irvine, California, with his wife, Janet, and their two sons, Jake and Logan.

== Broadcasting career ==

Rome started his radio career at college radio station KCSB-FM while at UCSB, where he was sports director for one quarter, and at news station KTMS, also located in Santa Barbara, where he began as a traffic reporter and became a sports talk host in summer 1987. At the end of 1990, he moved to XTRA Sports 690 in San Diego, where he started what is now known as &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot;, or &quot;The Jungle,&quot; with a loop of the instrumental intro of Iggy Pop&#x27;s song &quot;Lust for Life&quot; and the instrumental intro of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; song &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; as the show&#x27;s signature music.

The show&#x27;s production moved to a studio in downtown Los Angeles in spring 1994, though the broadcast was still originated by XTRA San Diego. At the same time as the studio move, the show start time shifted to 9am Pacific/12pm Eastern, where it remained until the end of 2024. The program was syndicated in 1996 through Premiere Radio Networks, which sold it to an assortment of local stations including ESPN Radio affiliates. A new contract that took effect in January 2013 brought the program to the CBS Sports Radio network, which simulcasted the program on its local FM/AM stations, its SiriusXM satellite channel (now known as Infinity Sports), and its cable TV channel. As of February 2024 the television version of the program was dropped by CBS Sports. The video feed is now marketed as a co-production with the X/Twitter platform and is also available on various other streaming services.

Beginning with the first new show of 2025 in January, the show moved to the 3-6 pm Eastern/12-3 pm Pacific timeslot. Many local stations and the Infinity Sports channel on Sirius chose to retain their pre-existing shows in that timeslot and no longer carry the Rome show, which is currently available on only 60 local affiliates and is seeking listeners on its streaming platforms instead.

Over time, the show&#x27;s production facility moved to the Premiere Radio building in Sherman Oaks, then an undisclosed Orange County location, and finally, as part of the start of TV simulcasting in January 2018, a custom-built studio in Costa Mesa. Due to past incidents of overzealous fans trespassing at the studio, the exact addresses of the former and current Orange County studios are not publicized. To provide continuity across the show&#x27;s eras in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Orange County, it is consistently referred to as originating from &quot;Southern California.&quot; In 2005, the TV versions of the show were criticized for obscuring the studio&#x27;s location by using the &quot;Southern California&quot; terminology and footage of the downtown Los Angeles skyline despite originating almost 40 miles away in the Costa Mesa area.

The radio show was formerly heard on more than 200 stations across the United States and Canada and had an audience of approximately 2.5 million. In 1998, Rome released an album entitled &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, which featured memorable sound bites and music from the show.

In early 2003, Rome was interviewing friend Mark Shapiro, executive producer of programming and production at ESPN, on his radio program. Unexpectedly, the two began to discuss a possible return of Rome to ESPN, and within a few months, Rome was officially rehired to host &quot;Rome Is Burning.&quot; Rome openly attributes that interview as the impetus to his return to television.

== Controversy and incidents ==

Rome gained notoriety in 1994 for an incident on his ESPN2 television show, &quot;Talk2&quot;, when his guest was NFL quarterback Jim Everett. Rome had often referred to Everett on radio as &quot;Chris&quot; (after Chris Evert, the female tennis player), suggesting that Everett was less than a man whenever he shied away from getting hit. Everett appeared as a guest on the television show, where he warned Rome about repeating the insult. Rome continued to address Everett as &quot;Chris&quot; and Everett overturned the table between them and shoved Rome to the floor while still on the air. Their confrontation resulted in no legal action, although Rome publicly apologized to Everett. Rome considers that event one of his early career mistakes.

In 1997, hockey legend Gordie Howe announced an attempt to play a shift with the International Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Vipers, which would allow Howe to claim having played professional hockey in six decades. Rome challenged the 69-year-old ex-hockey star, offering a bounty of $3,000 to any player on the team playing against the Vipers to take Howe out of the game permanently by saying, &quot;Putting this old fool back to reality.&quot; Rome clarified that the statements were a joke.

In 2012, Rome was involved in a controversy with NBA Commissioner David Stern. During an interview, Rome asked Stern about the conspiracy theories that the NBA Draft Lottery was fixed in favor of the New Orleans Hornets, and he asked, &quot;Was the fix in for the lottery?&quot; Stern replied with two answers: &quot;Number one, no; and a statement, shame on you for asking.&quot; He then proceeded to ask Rome the loaded question example of &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife yet?&quot; and accused Rome of &quot;making a career out of cheap thrills&quot;. This led to a heated exchange between Rome and Stern, ending when Stern said he had &quot;to go call someone important like Stephen A. Smith.&quot;

On January 1, 2015, Rome sent out a tweet that stated, &quot;Is there anyone not in a marching band who thinks those dorks running around with their instruments are cool?&quot; After a backlash, he later deleted the tweet and issued an apology. The incident also inspired the hashtag &quot;#MarchOnRome&quot;.

== Celebrity appearances ==
Rome made cameo appearances in the movies &quot;Space Jam&quot;,
&quot;Two for the Money&quot;, and the 2005 remake of &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;. He appeared in Blink-182&#x27;s music video &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; and appeared on the HBO sitcom &quot;Arliss&quot;. Rome was parodied in the South Park episode &quot;Sarcastaball&quot;, and the Jim Everett altercation was spoofed in the episode &quot;The F Word&quot;.

On May 3, 2004, Rome hosted the memorial service for Pat Tillman. On January 28, 2006, Rome was elected to the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

The Oliver Stone film &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; features John C. McGinley playing the brash sportscaster &quot;Jack Rose,&quot; a character based on Jim Rome.

==Horse racing==
After poking fun at horse racing for some years, saying &quot;it&#x27;s not a sport, it&#x27;s a bet,&quot; Rome seemed to take more interest in horse racing after interviewing Hall of Fame jockey Kent Desormeaux many times on his radio talk show. Rome thereafter took up a stronger interest in buying Thoroughbreds. He first became a part owner in Wing Forward, who, in his North American debut, made a dramatic last-to-first comeback to win the race. Rome mentioned it as &quot;one of the most amazing experiences I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; In 2008, Jim and his wife Janet purchased a stake in a two-year-old colt, giving them a potential shot at the Triple Crown stakes races in 2009. Listeners suggested names for the horse, who was eventually named Gallatin&#x27;s Run.

By 2012, Rome owned part or all of 14 horses in connection with multiple partnerships including his own stable, Jungle Racing, LLC. The first to gain national attention was the winner of the 2012 and 2013 Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf Sprint, a filly named Mizdirection. He described his feelings upon winning the Breeder&#x27;s Cup race, saying, “I’ve just had a moment I’ve never experienced in my life. That was absolutely awesome.” He purchased an interest in her for $50,000 in 2010. He co-owned the mare with Bill Strauss, Danny Gohs, Borris Beljak, and Kevin Nish. Mizdirection won 11 of 17 starts and retired from racing with $1,719,621 in earnings. She was usually ridden by jockey Mike Smith. Two days after her 2014 Breeders&#x27; Cup win, Mizdirection was purchased for $2.7 million at the Fasig-Tipton sale by Al Shaqab Racing of Qatar, owned by Sheikh Joaan Al Thani, and retired to become a broodmare.

Rome&#x27;s next significant race horse was Shared Belief, a gelding by Candy Ride, named the Eclipse Award winner in the two-year-old male division for 2013. As a three-year-old, he continued winning, and closed out the 2014 year with a record of eight wins in nine races (Five of six races in 2014 alone) and over $2 million in earnings, again with Mike Smith as his regular rider. As a four-year-old, the horse defeated 2014 Kentucky Derby winner and horse of the year California Chrome in both horses&#x27; first race of the season, then Shared Belief went on to a decisive win in the Santa Anita Handicap.

<doc id="61041" wikidata="Q473602" url="?curid=61041" title="Music of Poland">
<text>The music of Poland covers diverse aspects of music and musical traditions which have originated, and are practiced in Poland. Artists from Poland include world-famous classical composers like Frédéric Chopin, Karol Szymanowski, Witold Lutosławski, Henryk Górecki and Krzysztof Penderecki; renowned pianists like Karl Tausig, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Arthur Rubinstein and Krystian Zimerman; as well as popular music artists, and traditional, regionalised folk music ensembles that create a rich and lively music scene at the grassroots level. The musicians of Poland, over the course of history, have developed and popularized a variety of music genres and folk dances such as mazurka, polonaise, krakowiak, kujawiak, polska partner dance, oberek; as well as the sung poetry genre (&quot;poezja śpiewana&quot;) and others. Mazurek (Mazur), Krakowiak, Kujawiak, Oberek and Polonaise (Polonez) are registered as Polish National Dances, originating in early Middle Ages. The oldest of them is Polonaise that comes from the Medieval pageant dances and it was originally called &quot;chodzony&quot;, a &quot;walking dance&quot;.

Polish music exhibits influences from a broad variety of styles which are represented by critically acclaimed bands, such as Perfect (Zbigniew Hołdys), Status Qwo, Maanam (Kora), T.Love, Golec uOrkiestra, Budka Suflera, Czerwone Gitary, Dżem, Big Cyc, as well as many other renowned artists, e.g. Czesław Niemen, Magdalena Ostrowska, Jacek Kaczmarski, Wojciech Młynarski, Czesław Mozil, Jakob Węgiel, Marek Grechuta, and contemporary singer-songwriters and pop icons including Margaret, Maria Peszek, Myslovitz, Edyta Bartosiewicz, and Doda; jazz musicians Tomasz Stańko, Krzysztof Komeda, Włodek Pawlik, Adam Makowicz, Leszek Możdżer, and Michał Urbaniak; death and black metal music bands Behemoth, Vader, and Decapitated; and film and contemporary classical music composers Wojciech Kilar, Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, Zbigniew Preisner, Abel Korzeniowski, Krzesimir Dębski, and Krzysztof Meyer, among many others.

==Classical music==
===Medieval and Renaissance===
The origin of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century, from which manuscripts have been found in Stary Sącz, containing polyphonic compositions related to the Parisian Notre Dame School. Other early compositions, such as the melody of &quot;Bogurodzica&quot;, may also date back to this period. The first known notable composer, Mikołaj z Radomia (Nicholas of Radom), lived in the 15th century.

During the 16th century, mostly two musical ensembles – both based in Kraków and belonging to the King and the Archbishop of Wawel – led the rapid innovation of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include Wacław z Szamotuł, Mikołaj Zieleński, Nicolaus Cracoviensis, Marcin Leopolita and Mikołaj Gomółka, who composed &quot;Melodies to Polish Psalter&quot;. Diomedes Cato, a native-born Italian who lived in Kraków from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.

===Baroque===

During the 17th century, Polish composers from this period focused on baroque religious music, concertos for voices, instruments, and basso continuo, a tradition that continued into the 18th century. The most renowned composer of this period is Adam Jarzębski, known for his instrumental works such as &quot;Chromatica&quot;, &quot;Tamburetta&quot;, &quot;Sentinella&quot;, &quot;Bentrovata&quot;, and &quot;Nova Casa&quot;. Other composers include Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki, Franciszek Lilius, Bartłomiej Pękiel, Stanisław Sylwester Szarzyński and Marcin Mielczewski. Also, in the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century, a number of Italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of Sigismund III and Władysław IV. These included Luca Marenzio, Giovanni Francesco Anerio, and Marco Scacchi.

In addition, a tradition of operatic production began in Warsaw in 1628, with a performance of &quot;Galatea&quot; (composer uncertain), the first Italian opera produced outside Italy. Shortly after this performance, the court produced Francesca Caccini&#x27;s opera &quot;La liberazione di Ruggiero dall&#x27;isola d&#x27;Alcina&quot;, which she had written for Prince Władysław three years earlier when he was in Italy. Another first, this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman. When Władysław was king (as Władysław IV) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s, making Warsaw a center of the art. The composers of these operas are not known: they may have been Poles working under Marco Scacchi in the royal chapel, or they may have been among the Italians imported by Władysław.

Composers of the latter part of the 18th century included Maciej Radziwill, whose style has been characterized as being in the galant style.

===Classical===
Feliks Janiewicz, Karol Kurpiński, Jan Stefani, Wojciech Żywny and Franciszek Ścigalski were Polish composers writing in the classical period style characteristic in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The first national opera, &quot;Krakowiacy i Górale&quot; written by Wojciech Bogusławski and Jan Stefani premiered on 1 March 1794.

===Romantic===
At the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the Polonaise and Mazurka — perhaps the first distinctively Polish art music. Polonaises for piano were and remain popular, such as those by Jacek Szczurowski, Michał Kleofas Ogiński, Juliusz Zarębski, Henryk Wieniawski, Józef Elsner, and, most famously, Frédéric Chopin. Chopin remains very well known, and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works, including mazurkas, nocturnes, waltzes and concertos, and using traditional Polish elements in his pieces. The same period saw Stanisław Moniuszko, the leading individual in the successful development of Polish opera, still renowned for operas like &quot;Halka&quot; and &quot;The Haunted Manor&quot;.

In the 19th century the most popular composers were Maria Agata Szymanowska, Franciszek Lessel, and Ignacy Feliks Dobrzyński. Important opera composers were Karol Kurpiński and Stanisław Moniuszko. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the most prominent composers were Władysław Żeleński and Mieczysław Karłowicz. Karol Szymanowski gained prominence prior to World War II. Józef Koffler was the first Polish twelve-tone composer (dodecaphonist).

===Contemporary===

Between the wars, a group of new and emerging composers formed the Association of Young Polish Musicians; which included future luminaries Grażyna Bacewicz, Zygmunt Mycielski, Michał Spisak and Tadeusz Szeligowski.

Following World War II and the country becoming a communist system, some composers, such as Roman Palester and Andrzej Panufnik, fled the country and remained in exile. In the early 1960s, a number of Polish composers formed the Polish Composers&#x27; School, characterized by the use of sonorism and dodecaphonism. The style emerged from the political crisis in 1956, following Stalin&#x27;s death. In the same year the Warsaw Autumn music festival was inaugurated, both closely connected. According to conductor Antoni Wit composers were given artistic freedom because the Polish regime wasn&#x27;t as harsh as other Eastern European dictatorships and music wasn&#x27;t considered ideologically relevant unlike literature, theater or cinema. Composers from the &quot;Polish School&quot; included Tadeusz Baird, Bogusław Schaeffer, Włodzimierz Kotoński, Witold Szalonek, Krzysztof Penderecki, Witold Lutosławski, Wojciech Kilar, Kazimierz Serocki, Tomasz Sikorski, Zygmunt Krauze and Henryk Mikołaj Górecki.

More modern classical and jazz composers include Krzysztof Meyer, Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, Paweł Szymański, Krzesimir Dębski, Hanna Kulenty, Eugeniusz Knapik, Paweł Łukaszewski, Paweł Mykietyn, Maciej Zieliński, Marcel Chyrzyński, Marta Ptaszynska and Agata Zubel.

===Recordings===
The Polskie Nagrania Muza was the state recording company, from 1956. Following the fall of communism it was bought by Warner Music Poland. It dealt with the wide range of music tastes, folk, popular, classical and children&#x27;s music.

==Traditional folk music==
Polish folk music was collected in the 19th century by Oskar Kolberg, as part of a wave of Polish national revival. After World War II, in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, folk traditions were commonly cultivated, but public performances and broadcasts had also highly organized and officially promoted forms. State-supported, large-scale folk ensembles became prominent. The most famous of these were Mazowsze and Śląsk, both of which still perform. Though such bands presented interpretations of regional folk repertoire, the overall sound was a homogenized mixture of Polish styles. There were more authentic groups, such as Słowianki, but the sanitized image of folk music made the whole field unattractive to some audiences, and many traditions dwindled rapidly.

Polish dance music, especially the mazurka and polonaise, were popularized by Frédéric Chopin, and they soon spread across Europe and elsewhere. These are triple time dances, while five-beat forms are more common in the northeast and duple-time dances like the krakowiak come from the south. The &#x27;polonaise&#x27; comes from the French word for &#x27;Polish&#x27; used to identify its origin among the Polish aristocracy who had adapted the dance from a slower walking dance called &quot;chodzony&quot;. The polonaise then re-entered the lower-class musical life, and became an integral part of the Polish music.

===Podhale===
While folk music lost popularity in Poland, especially in urban areas, the tourist destination of Podhale has retained its lively traditions. The regional capital, Zakopane, has been a center for art since the late 19th century, when people like composer Karol Szymanowski, who discovered Goral folk music there, made the area chic among Europe&#x27;s intellectuals. Though a part of Poland, Podhale&#x27;s musical life is more closely related to that found in the Carpathian mountains of Ukraine, Slovakia, Moravia in Czech Republic and Romania.

Local ensembles use string instruments like violins and a cello to play distinctive scales with augumented fourth, mainly the lydian mode and acoustic scale, in Poland called &quot;skala podhalańska&quot;. The distinctive singing style used in this scale is called &quot;lidyzowanie&quot;. The lead violin (&quot;prym&quot;) are accompanied by several second violins (&quot;sekund&quot;) and a three-stringed cello (&quot;basy&quot;). Duple-time dances like the &quot;krzesany&quot;, &quot;zbójnicki&quot; (the Brigand&#x27;s Dance) and &quot;ozwodna&quot; are popular. The ozwodna has a five-bar melodic structure which is quite unusual. The krzesany is an extremely swift dance, while the zbójnicki is well-known and is perceived as being most &quot;typical&quot; of Podhale and Northern Slovakia. Folk songs typically focus on heroes like Juraj Jánošík.

===Other regions===
Outside of Podhale, few regions have active folk scenes, though there are music festivals, such as the Kazimierz Festival, which are well-known and popular. Regional folk bands include Gienek Wilczek Band (Bukowina), Tadeusz Jedynak Band (Przystalowice Male), Stachy Band (Hazców nad Wislokiem), Franciszek Gola Band (Kadzidło), Edward Markocki Band (Zmyslówka-Podlesie), Kazimierz Kantor Band (Głowaczowa), Swarni Band (Nowy Targ), Kazimierz Meto Band (Glina), Ludwik Młynarczyk Band (Lipnica), Kujawska Atlantyda (Kujawy) and Trebunie-Tutki.

==Contemporary popular music==

Poland has always been a very open country to new music genres and even before the fall of the communism, music styles like rock, metal, jazz, electronic, and new wave were well-known. Since 1989, the Polish scene has exploded with new talents and a more diverse style.

Every year, a huge gathering of young Poles meet to honour the rock and alternative music in Jarocin, Żary, at Woodstock Festival Poland in Kostrzyn nad Odrą and at Open&#x27;er Festival and Off Festival. These events often attract more than 250,000 people and are comparable to the gatherings in Woodstock and Roskilde.

In jazz music, Polish musicians created a specific style, which was most famous in 1960s and 1970s. Some prominent Polish jazz artists are: Krzysztof Komeda, Zbigniew Namysłowski, Adam Makowicz, Tomasz Stańko, Włodek Pawlik, Michał Urbaniak, Leszek Możdżer. Some of the most popular and commercially successful Polish vocalists of 20th and 21st centuries are Czesław Niemen, Edyta Górniak, Myslovitz, Doda, Maryla Rodowicz, Kamil Bednarek, Ewa Farna, Agnieszka Chylińska, Sylwia Grzeszczak, Michał Szpak, Edyta Bartosiewicz, Anna Maria Jopek, Kasia Nosowska, Dawid Podsiadło, Sarsa, Monika Brodka and Margaret.

Two contemporary big Polish music festivals are Opole Festival and Sopot Festival. Among other important festivals there are: Jazz Jamboree, Rawa Blues Festival and Wratislavia Cantans.

==Heavy metal==

=== Black metal ===

Black metal in Poland has evolved since the 1980s, although the first bands strictly in this genre appeared in the early 1990s, with the growth of the Norwegian black metal movement. One of the first Polish black metal bands, founded in late 1979, was Kat from Katowice, which was originally classified as thrash, and heavy metal. Kat was a major influence on Polish heavy metal music, developing their harsh sound with straightforward satanic lyrics, and later were heavily inspired by the poetry of Tadeusz Miciński. The group has reformed several times over the years, and remains active, with their guitarist co-founder on studio projects. After a naming dispute in the early 2000s Kat &amp; Roman Kostrzewski continue with both their live, and studio legacy.

Other bands, classified as black metal in the 1980s, include Imperator (founded in 1984) with an antichristian approach in their music, and Vader (founded in 1983) with Satan themed lyrics, appearing on stage in leather and spikes. While still active, Vader later developed a death metal sound with occult themed lyrics, Imperator&#x27;s style of music is disputed; reformed twice in the 1990s, the band eventually dissolved in 2000, with only one studio album released. Minor Polish black metal bands of the 1980s include Fantom (founded 1985), Scarecrow with an origin in speed metal (formed 1987), thrash metal influenced Bundeswehra (1988), Apocalyptic Slaughter (1988), Dethroner later renamed Enormity (1987). All were short lived local acts, who only released demo recordings.

In the 1990s a wide range of black metal bands developed, such as Christ Agony, Mussorgski (both founded in 1990), Behemoth, Besatt, Xantotol (all founded in 1991), Oppressor later renamed Baphomets Throne, Mastiphal, Graveland, North, Taranis, Infernum (all founded in 1992), Hermh, Arkona, Thunderbolt, Profanum (all founded in 1993), Lux Occulta (founded in 1994), Darzamat (founded in 1995), Witchmaster (founded in 1996), Crionics and Vesania (founded in 1997). After its first album, Christ Agony signed to the French Adipocere Records, then to Cacophonous Records, and then to Hammerheart Records. They received a brief period of recognition in the European underground, but later became a minor act. After their seventh album in 2009 Christ Agony eventually signed to Mystic Production and gained nostalgic recognition in Poland with support from European tours.

During early and mid-1990s, Behemoth, Graveland, Infernum, Profanum, Kataxu and other bands developed a distinguishable Polish black metal style, which featured a decent atmospheric keyboard usage and nature sound samples (e.g. wind, raven cries), while still preserving the raw production values. Behemoth quickly become popular in the underground with support from Graveland&#x27;s mainman Rob Darken, and later with influentional label Avantgarde Music. Based in Gdańsk, the band eventually developed death metal influenced sound, and gained international recognition. Other bands of the 1990s such as Baphomets Throne, North, Mussorgski, Besatt, Infernum remained active, but were signed to underground labels and never received international acclaim. In later years only Darzamat, after several album releases, were signed to Massacre Records, but their short lived European recognition was broken by lineup changes. Vesania signed to Napalm Records, went on hiatus, but released three albums in the 2000s. Later, Poland developed bands such as MasseMord, Mgła (both founded in 2000), Furia (founded in 2003), Morowe (2006) and Blaze of Perdition (2007); though all of these are only known in the underground circuit.

Within black metal in Poland, several National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) bands developed such as Veles (founded in 1992), Gontyna Kry (founded in 1993), Kataxu (1994), Ohtar (1996), and Sunwheel (1998). All of which attracted the interest of the Anti-Defamation League, and were considered to perform &quot;music of hate&quot;. In the early 1990s NSBM was also investigated by the Polish Office for State Protection. Although Graveland were extremely popular among NSBM fans and generally seen as a National Socialist band, Rob Darken rejects this label, and told Decibel magazine: &quot;I do not think Graveland is an NSBM band. Graveland is regarded as a NSBM band because of my political convictions, [which] most people would call extreme right-wing, National Socialist convictions.&quot;

=== Death metal ===

In the 1980s Poland developed an early death metal movement, though at the time many of the bands were referred to as either black metal or thrash metal, many were later classified as death metal. Some of the bands of the period include Vader, which started as a classic heavy metal group (founded in 1983), and others with origin in thrash metal, like Imperator (founded in 1984), Armagedon (founded in 1986), Magnus (founded in 1987), Ghost and Thanatos later renamed Trauma (both founded in 1988), Bloodlust, and Betrayer (both founded in 1989). Many of the groups disbanded in the early 1990s after only one album, although several gained an underground following in Europe due to tape trading. Vader became the only one to remain active since its formation, and reached international fan base, with albums charting in Poland, Germany, and Japan, on labels such as Earache Records, Metal Blade Records, and Nuclear Blast among others. While Trauma also remained active since its formation they never reached the same recognition. Since the late 2000s several of the &quot;classic&quot; bands such as Magnus, Armagedon, and Merciless Death have been reformed, and have since remained active.

In the 1990s a second wave of death metal was developed with bands such as Violent Dirge, Lost Soul, Hazael, Hate, Pandemonium (all founded in 1990), Cerebral Concussion later renamed Devilyn, Prophecy, Dies Irae (all founded in 1992), Sceptic (founded in 1994), Decapitated, and Yattering (both founded in 1996). The highly technical music of Violent Dirge became the interest of influential label Nuclear Blast who later released the groups sampler. Although Violent Dirge dissolved in 1995 after the release of several demos, and two underground albums with success remaining only in Poland. Hazael was also subject of interest from eastern record label Century Media Records. But after signing a contract, and recording the album for the label they were dropped. This eventually lead to the break up of the band in 1996. However, they went on to reform in 2014.

Recognition in Europe led bands such as Devilyn to get signed to Listenable Records, Yattering a recording deal with Season of Mist for their second release, and Prophecy signed to Koch International. After losing popularity Prophecy went on hiatus in 1999, and reformed in 2004, but eventually split-up in 2010, while Devilyn, and Yattering disbanded in 2006. Hate after several underground albums reached international recognition in the 2000s after signing to Listenable Records, and later Napalm Records, Dies Irae, reformed in 2000 consisting of members of Vader signed to Metal Blade Records, and released three albums, until the death of their drummer.

In late 1990s Decapitated was signed to Wicked World a subsidiary of Earache Records. The band released several albums, later reaching international acclaim after reforming in 2009, and a new recording deal with Nuclear Blast. After reforming in 1997 Lost Soul signed with Relapse Records to release their debut album, in 2006 the band went in hiatus, and lost their minor popularity in Europe. They once again reformed in 2009 and signed to an underground Polish label, they occasional tour in their home country. In the early 2000s with the release of third album Sceptic signed to Candlelight Records. After only touring in Poland the label eventually dropped Sceptic from their catalogue. Other minor Polish death bands active mostly in the European underground scene include Stillborn (founded in 1997), Azarath (founded in 1998), Deivos (founded in 1999) and Masachist (founded in 2006) among others. Although founded in 1991 as a black metal band Behemoth reached international acclaim from their mixture of black metal with death metal, with one album certified Gold in Poland and three charting on the Billboard 200 in the US.

=== Thrash metal ===

In the early 1980s, in response to the American thrash metal wave, Poland developed their own thrash metal scene. Bands of this period include Kat (founded in late 1979), who started as a speed/heavy metal group, Turbo (founded in 1980), who had origins in rock and heavy metal, as well as some strict thrash metal bands such as Kreon, Dragon (both founded in 1984), Destroyers, Hammer (both founded in 1985), Quo Vadis, Alastor, Hunter, Wolf Spider, Acid Drinkers (all founded in 1986), and Egzekuthor (founded in 1987), among others. The 1980s is also when the thrash metal scene in Poland had the most success, with bands finding a starting place in the Metalmania festival (based in Katowice). Bands like Destroyers, Hamer, Dragon, and Wolf Spider became the subjects of interest of national record labels Pronit and Polton, with the bands sharing recordings on split albums. Destroyers continued performing until early 1990; their later albums were released by the national labels Tonpress and Polskie Nagrania Muza. Wolf Spider, after four albums, disbanded in 1991; they later reformed in 2011. Dragon, in later years, developed a death metal influenced style, and they remained active until 2000 with five albums released. Hamer, after reforming several times, remain active.

Turbo, with their popularity based on the protest song &quot;Dorosłe dzieci&quot;, switched to a thrash metal sound after two albums released only in Poland. Several attempts to cross over the Polish border have been made by Turbo with English language albums, which have been released by the German label Noise Records, the Italian label Metal Master Records, and the British label Under One Flag (a subsidiary of Music for Nations). Due to problems receiving passports, Turbo remains a local act; they have disbanded and reformed several times, have released eleven albums, and are still active. The band Kat had taken a similar approach; after several singles released in Poland, they signed to Belgian Ambush Records to release their debut album. Due to being unable to tour outside Poland, Kat remains local, with several Polish language albums released. Kat reformed several times over the years; they remain active solely as a studio project. After a name dispute in the early 2000s the act named Kat &amp; Roman Kostrzewski continues with their legacy.

Acid Drinkers is another Polish band that attempted to tour outside home country. In the years after the revolutions of 1989, Acid Drinkers members revoked their passports, but after problems with visas, it occurred to them that they needed to eventually stop their protests. They remain active only in Poland and have received cult status with fifteen albums released, several of which have appeared on Polish Albums Charts. Other bands like Quo Vadis and Alastor remain active in underground scenes to incorporate in later years to their music groove, death or progressive metal. Egzekuthor disbanded in 1992 after one album, reformed in 2002 to be disbanded in 2008 before second studio effort was released. While Hunter have waited till 1995 to release first album reached acclaim in Poland with 2000s albums. Although over the years moving away from strict thrash metal style Hunter received nomination to Fryderyk, an annual award in Polish music, within several records on Polish Albums Chart have been noted, with songs to receive regular airplay. In later years several thrash metal band have emerged while none have reached the acclaim of those from the 1980s. Some of them include Geisha Goner (founded in 1990), Tuff Enuff (founded in 1992), Flapjack, Myopia (both founded in 1993), Horrorscope (founded in 1996), Virgin Snatch, and Alkatraz (both founded in 2001).

=== Gothic metal ===

Poland developed their gothic metal scene in the 1990s, although it was intertwined with the gothic rock movement since the beginning, focused around the Castle Party Festival founded in 1994. The scene was loosely inspired by Polish bands such as Closterkeller, Pornografia, Fading Colours (all founded in the 1980s), and in later years by British acts like Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Anathema, and Norwegian Theatre of Tragedy among others. The earliest of the Polish gothic bands developed their sound from various styles like rock, black, death and doom metal, that include Battalion d&#x27;Amour (founded in 1989), Neolithic, Moonlight (both founded in 1991), Sacriversum, Sirrah (both founded in 1992), Hermh, Cemetery of Scream (both founded in 1993), Hefeystos, and Tower (both founded in 1994) among others. Most Polish gothic metal bands since the 1990s reached recognition only in Poland, or for short time in Europe. Compared with the black or death movement, gothic metal is a minor music scene.

Although considered as a rock band, Closterkeller developed a gothic metal sound in the late 1990s. With nine both native and English language albums released up to 2011 they became the most influential Polish gothic band. Battalion d&#x27;Amour with their poetic lyrics reached popularity with 1990s albums, which was lost after a change of the group&#x27;s lead vocalist in the early 2000s. The band released their last album in 2005. Neolithic signed to French Adipocere Records developed a doom and progressive metal influenced sound. They released two albums and disbanded in 2006 with brief recognition in their home country. Moonlight active until 2007 released several albums in 2000s, combining a gothic metal style with trip hop and rock. Reformed several of times of the years, Hermh began as a gothic metal act before switching to symphonic black metal with vampire themed lyrics, and remains a studio project. Cemetery of Scream with five albums released is still active. Hefeystos, with a progressive rock influenced sound, released two albums, and eventually disbanded in 2000. While Tower disbanded in the late 1990s, also with two albums released. Only Sirrah reached short-lived recognition in Europe with a recording deal from Music for Nations. Disbanded in 1998, the group was reformed in 2013 and is still active.

The second wave of gothic bands includes Artrosis, Lorien (both founded in 1995), Aion, Desdemona (both founded in 1996), Sator (later renamed Delight; founded in 1997), and Via Mistica (founded in 1998), among others. Artrosis quickly reached popularity in Poland with albums released by local label Morbid Noizz Productions. In the late 1990s Artrosis became the subject of interest from Tilo Wolffs label Hall of Sermon which released an English version of one of their albums. The band reached its popularity in the early 2000s with a contract from Metal Mind Productions. The band released seven Polish and four English language albums and remain active. Loriens popularity came with a debut album released by underground labels in Europe, USA, and Australia with promotion from Polskie Radio in their home country. After several line-up changes and one more album released, Lorien disbanded in 2005. Eight years later the group was reformed and is still active. While Aion gained some European acclaim with two albums released by Massacre Records, and Impact Records. In later years the band remained local act with a recording deal from Metal Mind Productions. Eventually changing style to modern heavy metal on their fifth album, Aion disbanded after its release in 2004.

Although Desdemona&#x27;s debut album was released in Japan, the band became a local act with albums released by Metal Mind Productions, eventually dropping their gothic metal style in favour of industrial with four album released, and a recording deal from Danse Macabre Records. Delight which began as a power metal band reached recognition in Poland with support from extensive touring, and several both Polish and English language albums released in the early 2000s. In 2005 after a performance at Wave Gotik Treffen in Germany Delight was signed to Roadrunner Records, although after one album released the group was disbanded with no official statement. Via Mistica remains a local act with three albums released in the early 2000s. In later years several gothic metal bands have emerged, most of them remaining minor part of Polish heavy metal scene, that include such acts like Mystherium (founded in 2001), Ciryam (founded in 2003), UnSun (founded in 2006), and NeraNature (founded in 2009) among others. Only UnSun reached international acclaim with a recording deal from Century Media Records, and albums charting in Japan, although after two albums the group went on hiatus due to problems with the vocalist&#x27;s health.

<doc id="61045" wikidata="Q854654" url="?curid=61045" title="Bandai Namco Filmworks">
<text>, is a Japanese entertainment company owned by Bandai Namco Holdings with its business focused on production, planning, and management of anime. It was founded in September 1972 by former Mushi Production staff as , the animation studio branch of . In 1977, it gained independence from Shoeisha and Tohokushinsha and rebranded itself to . In 1987, the studio rebranded to , a name which would remain in use for over 35 years. In 1994, the company was acquired by toy and entertainment company Bandai and was integrated into Namco Bandai Holdings in 2005.

In 2022, as part of a major group restructuring of the Bandai Namco Group, the company would merge with the home video division of Bandai Namco Arts and Bandai Namco Rights Marketing to form Bandai Namco Filmworks. As part of this restructuring, Sunrise would continue to operate as a division within the company with the changes taking effect on April 1, 2022.

==History==
According to an interview with Sunrise members, the studio was founded by former members of Mushi Production in 1972 as Sunrise Studio. Rather than having anime production revolve around a single creator (like Mushi, headed by Osamu Tezuka), Sunrise decided that production should focus on the producers. The market for mainstream anime (such as manga adaptations, sports shows, and adaptations of popular children&#x27;s stories) was already dominated by existing companies, so Sunrise decided to focus on robot (mecha) anime, known to be more difficult to animate but which could be used to sell toys.

Sunrise has been involved in many popular and acclaimed anime television series, including &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (and its spin-offs and sequels since 1979), the &quot;Mashin Hero Wataru&quot; series (1988–1997), the &quot;Brave&quot; (1990–1997) and &quot;Eldran&quot; series (1991–1993), both of which were co-produced with Takara Tomy, and the &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; series (1999–2001). They produced the apocalyptic &quot;Space Runaway Ideon&quot; in 1980.

The company have co-produced a number of series with Toei Company, including &quot;Majokko Tickle&quot; (1978), the &quot;Robot Romance Trilogy&quot; (&quot;Combattler V&quot; (1976), &quot;Voltes V&quot; (1977), &quot;Tōshō Daimos&quot; (1978)), &quot;Daltanious&quot; (1979), and &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; (1979). Sunrise is well known for their mecha anime series (including &quot;Gundam&quot;), such as &quot;Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3&quot; (1978), &quot;Fang of the Sun Dougram&quot; (1981), the &quot;Armored Trooper Votoms&quot; and &quot;Aura Battler Dunbine&quot; series (1983), &quot;Blue Comet SPT Layzner&quot; (1985), &quot;&quot; (1989), &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; (1996), &quot;The Big O&quot; (1999/2003), &quot;Overman King Gainer&quot; (2002), &quot;Zegapain&quot; (2007), &quot;Code Geass&quot; (2006/2008), &quot;Tiger &amp; Bunny&quot; (2011), and &quot;Valvrave the Liberator&quot; (2013), and worked with Tsuburaya Productions to animate &quot;The Ultraman&quot; (1979).

In February 1994, Sunrise Inc. became part of the Bandai Group.

On April 1, 2022, Bandai Namco Holdings adopted a new logo that had been initially revealed in October 2021, and with it, a major organization shuffle occurred, resulting in Sunrise subsuming the visual arts division of Bandai Namco Arts, which was dissolved that same day. Following this, the company has adopted the same logo as its parent, and adopted the name of Bandai Namco Filmworks. Its music division, Sunrise Music, has similarly subsumed Bandai Namco Arts&#x27; music operations, including Lantis, and changed its name to Bandai Namco Music Live. The Sunrise name has been kept as one of the major brands of the company as of August 2023.

On March 1, 2024, Bandai Namco Filmworks announced the acquisition of anime studio Eight Bit, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.

On February 4, 2025, Bandai Namco Holdings USA announced the establishment of Bandai Namco Filmworks America to handle the company&#x27;s licensing and brand management activities internationally, which will take effect on April 1st. The announcement coincided with the start of the co-financing and co-production of the &quot;Gundam&quot; film with Legendary Pictures.

==International distribution==
Most anime produced by Sunrise and Bandai and licensed by Bandai Visual in Japan was licensed and distributed in the United States by Bandai Entertainment and in Europe by Beez Entertainment, but both companies shut down in 2012 after Bandai Entertainment&#x27;s restructuring. In North America, distributors such as Funimation, Viz Media, Sentai Filmworks, NIS America and Aniplex of America, as well as Sunrise USA, have licensed Sunrise properties. In Europe, Anime Limited and Manga Entertainment (in the UK) and Kazé (in France) have begun to distribute titles distributed by Beez and other unreleased Sunrise productions. In Australia, Sunrise productions are licensed and distributed by Madman Entertainment. At Anime Boston 2013, Sunrise confirmed that they would begin licensing anime in North America and were negotiating with Sentai, Funimation, and Viz to distribute their titles on DVD and Blu-ray. Right Stuf agreed to distribute and re-release &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn&quot; on DVD in North America. In 2014 the deal expanded, releasing the Gundam previously licensed by Bandai Entertainment (&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot;) and several works not released in North America (including &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ&quot;) in 2015.

<doc id="61046" wikidata="Q272036" url="?curid=61046" title="Wings (1927 film)">
<text>Wings is a 1927 American silent and synchronized sound war film which won the first Academy Award for Best Picture. While the sound version of the film has no audible dialogue, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects. The original soundtrack to the sound version is preserved at UCLA.

The film stars Clara Bow, Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers, and Richard Arlen. Rogers and Arlen portray World War I combat pilots in a romantic rivalry over a woman. It was produced by Lucien Hubbard, directed by William A. Wellman, and released by Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Gary Cooper appears in a small role, which helped launch his career in Hollywood.

The film, a romantic action-war picture, was rewritten by scriptwriters Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton from a story by John Monk Saunders to accommodate Bow, Paramount&#x27;s biggest star at the time. Wellman was hired, as he was the only director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat pilot experience, although Richard Arlen and John Monk Saunders had also served in the war as military aviators. The film was shot on location on a budget of $2 million (equivalent to $ million in ) at Kelly Field in San Antonio, between September 7, 1926, and April 7, 1927. Hundreds of extras and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming, including pilots and planes of the United States Army Air Corps which were brought in for the filming and to provide assistance and supervision. Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3,500 infantrymen on a battlefield made for the production on location. Although the cast and crew had much spare time during the filming because of weather delays, shooting conditions were intense, and Wellman frequently conflicted with the military officers brought in to supervise the picture.

Acclaimed for its technical prowess and realism upon release, the film became the yardstick against which future aviation films were measured, mainly because of its realistic air-combat sequences. It went on to win the inaugural Academy Award for Outstanding Picture at the first Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences award ceremony in 1929, the only fully silent film to do so. It also won the Academy Award for Best Engineering Effects (Roy Pomeroy). &quot;Wings&quot; was one of the first widely released films to show nudity. In 1997, &quot;Wings&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, and the film was re-released to Cinemark theaters to coincide with the 85th anniversary for a limited run in May 2012. The film was re-released again for its 90th anniversary in 2017. The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Wings&quot; in 2002.

The film entered the public domain in the United States in 2023.

==Plot==
Jack Powell and David Armstrong are rivals in the same small American town, both vying for the attentions of pretty Sylvia Lewis. Jack fails to realize that &quot;the girl next door&quot;, Mary Preston, is desperately in love with him. The two young men both enlist to become combat pilots in the Army Air Service. When they leave for training camp, Jack mistakenly believes Sylvia prefers him, but she actually prefers David and lets him know about her feelings, but is too kindhearted to turn down Jack&#x27;s affection.

The two men endure a rigorous training period, where they are enemies. But during a bloody boxing match, they realize each other&#x27;s courage and become best friends. Upon graduating, they are sent to France to fight against Imperial Germany.

Jack and David are billeted together. Their tent mate is Cadet White, but their acquaintance is all too brief; White is killed in an air crash the same day.

Mary joins the war effort by becoming an ambulance driver. She later learns of Jack&#x27;s reputation as the ace known as &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; and encounters him while on leave in Paris. She finds him, but he is too drunk to recognize her. She takes him back to his room and puts him to bed, but when two military police barge-in while she is innocently changing from a borrowed dress back into her uniform in the same room, she is forced to resign and return to the United States.

The climax of the story comes with the epic Battle of Saint-Mihiel. David is shot down and presumed dead. However, he survives the crash landing, steals a German biplane, and heads for the Allied lines. By a tragic stroke of bad luck, Jack spots the enemy aircraft and, bent on avenging his friend, begins an attack. He is successful in downing the aircraft and lands to retrieve a souvenir of his victory. The owner of the land where David&#x27;s aircraft crashed urges Jack to come to the dying man&#x27;s side. He agrees and becomes distraught when he realizes what he has done. David consoles him, and before he dies, forgives his comrade.

At the war&#x27;s end, Jack returns home to a hero&#x27;s welcome. He visits David&#x27;s grieving parents to return his friend&#x27;s effects. During the visit, he begs their forgiveness for causing David&#x27;s death. Mrs. Armstrong says it is not Jack who is responsible for her son&#x27;s death, but the war. Then, Jack is reunited with Mary and realizes he loves her.

==Music==

==Production==

===Script and experience===

The film was written by John Monk Saunders (with uncredited story ideas contributed by Byron Morgan), Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton (screenplay), produced by Lucien Hubbard (who also did uncredited co-editing), directed by William A. Wellman, with an original orchestral score by J.S. Zamecnik, which was also uncredited. It was rewritten to accommodate Clara Bow, as she was Paramount&#x27;s biggest star, but she wasn&#x27;t happy about her part: &quot;&quot;Wings&quot; is...a man&#x27;s picture and I&#x27;m just the whipped cream on top of the pie&quot;.

Producers Lucien Hubbard and Jesse L. Lasky hired director Wellman as he was the only director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat pilot experience. Actor Richard Arlen and writer John Monk Saunders had also served in World War I as military aviators. Arlen was able to do his own flying in the film and Rogers, a non-pilot, underwent flight training during the course of the production, so that, like Arlen, Rogers could also be filmed in closeup in the air. Lucien Hubbard offered flying lessons to all, and despite the number of aircraft in the air, only two incidents occurred—one involved stunt pilot Dick Grace, who broke his neck falling out of the cockpit after a controlled crash; while the other was the fatal crash of an Army Air Service pilot. Wellman was able to attract War Department support and involvement in the project, and displayed considerable prowess and confidence in dealing with planes and pilots onscreen, knowing &quot;exactly what he wanted&quot;, bringing with it a &quot;no-nonsense attitude&quot; according to military film historian Lawrence H. Suid.

===Filming===
====Aerial and battle sequences====

&quot;Wings&quot; was shot and completed on a budget of $2 million at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas between September 7, 1926, and April 7, 1927. Primary scout aircraft flown in the film were Thomas-Morse MB-3s standing in for American-flown SPADs and Curtiss P-1 Hawks painted in German livery. Developing the techniques needed for filming closeups of the pilots in the air and capturing the speed and motion of the planes onscreen took time, and little usable footage was produced in the first two months. Wellman soon realized that Kelly Field did not have the adequate numbers of planes or skilled pilots to perform the needed aerial maneuvers, and he had to request technical assistance and a supply of planes and pilots from Washington. The Air Corps sent six planes and pilots from the 1st Pursuit Group stationed at Selfridge Field near Detroit, including then-2nd Lt. Elmer J. Rogers Jr. and 2d Lt. Clarence S. &quot;Bill&quot; Irvine who became Wellman&#x27;s adviser. Irvine was responsible for engineering an airborne camera system to provide close-ups and for the planning of the dogfights, and when one of the pilots broke his neck, performed in one of the battle scenes himself.

Hundreds of extras were brought in to shoot the picture, and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming. Because the aerial battles required ideal weather to shoot, the production team had to wait on one occasion for 18 consecutive days for proper conditions in San Antonio. If possible, Wellman attempted to capture footage in the air in contrast to clouds in the background, above or in front of cloud banks to generate a sense of velocity and danger. Wellman later explained, &quot;motion on the screen is a relative thing. A horse runs on the ground or leaps over fencers or streams. We know he is going rapidly because of his relation to the immobile ground&quot;. Against the clouds, Wellman enabled the planes to &quot;dart at each other&quot;, and to &quot;swoop down and disappear in the clouds&quot;, and to give the audience the sense of the disabled planes plummeting. During the delay in the aerial shooting, Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen. A large battlefield with trenches and barbed wire was created on location for the filming. Wellman took responsibility for the meticulously planned explosions himself, detonating them at the right time from his control panel. According to Peter Hopkinson, at least 20 young men, including cameraman William Clothier, were given hand-held cameras to film &quot;anything and everything&quot; during the filming.

Wellman frequently conflicted with the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have &quot;two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people&quot;. After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, &quot;You&#x27;re just a goddamn fool because the government has told me you have to give me all your men and do just exactly what I want you to do.&quot; Although Wellman paid much attention to technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.

====Cast exploits====

Whereas most Hollywood productions of the day took little more than a month to shoot, &quot;Wings&quot; took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, &quot;a trip home or a trip to the hospital&quot;. According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, &quot;Just keep your mouth shut. You&#x27;ve got &#x27;em where it hurts.&quot; Otto Kahn, the financier bankrolling the production, arrived on set as Wellman was filming the St-Mihiel battle sequence, inadvertently disrupted Wellman&#x27;s detonation timings, and caused several extras to be seriously injured. Wellman loudly and profanely ordered Kahn off the set. That evening, Kahn visited Wellman in his hotel room, told him he was impressed with his direction, and he could have whatever he needed to finish the picture.

The cast and crew had a lot of time on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, &quot;San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook&quot;. He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months and by the time they left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he was not impressed, considering the drama in it to be &quot;sudsy&quot;, although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the wardrobe that Paramount designer Travis Banton made for the film. She slit the necklines and cut off the sleeves of her costumes, much to Banton&#x27;s chagrin.

====Notable scenes====

&quot;Wings&quot; is also one of the first widely released films to show nudity. In the enlistment office, nude men are visible from behind undergoing physical exams, through a door which opens and closes several times. In the scene in which Rogers becomes drunk, the intoxication displayed on screen was genuine, as although 22 years of age, he had never tasted liquor before, and quickly became inebriated from drinking champagne. During David&#x27;s death scene, Jack is plainly observed kissing him on the left cheek near the left corner of Dave&#x27;s mouth, which has led to interpretations of this film as depicting cinema&#x27;s first LGBT male-to-male kiss. While there is no general consensus about which film achieves this LGBT milestone, D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Manslaughter&quot; (1922), and Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930) have also been suggested.

==Release and reception==

Wellman dedicated the film &quot;to those young warriors of the sky whose wings are folded about them forever&quot;. A sneak preview was shown May 19, 1927, at the Texas Theater on Houston Street in San Antonio. The premiere was held at the Criterion Theater, in New York City, on August 12, 1927, and was screened for 63 weeks before being moved to second-run theaters. The film eventually opened in Los Angeles on January 15, 1928. The original Paramount release of &quot;Wings&quot; was color tinted and had some sequences in an early widescreen process known as Magnascope, also used in the 1926 Paramount film &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;. The original release also had the aerial scenes use the Handschiegl color process for flames and explosions. Late in 1928, a sound version was prepared with synchronized sound effects and music, using the General Electric Kinegraphone (later RCA Photophone) sound-on-film process.

&quot;Wings&quot; was an immediate success upon release and became the yardstick against which successive aviation films were measured for years thereafter, in terms of &quot;authenticity of combat and scope of production&quot;. One of the reasons for its resounding popularity was the public infatuation with aviation in the wake of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s transatlantic flight. The Air Corps who had supervised production expressed satisfaction with the end product. The critical response was equally enthusiastic and the film was widely praised for its realism and technical prowess, despite a superficial plot, &quot;an aviation picnic&quot; as Gene Brown called it. The combat scenes of the film were so realistic that one writer studying the film in the early 1970s was wondering if Wellman had used actual imagery of planes crashing to earth during World War I. One critic observed: &quot;The exceptional quality of &quot;Wings&quot; lies in its appeal as a spectacle and as a picture of at least some of the actualities of flying under wartime conditions.&quot; Another wrote: &quot;Nothing in the line of war pictures ever has packed a greater proportion of real thrills into an equal footage. As a spectacle, &quot;Wings&quot; is a technical triumph. It piles punch upon punch until the spectator is almost nervously exhausted&quot;. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the cinematography of the flying scenes and the direction and acting of the entire cast in his review dated August 13, 1927. Hall notes only two criticisms, one slight on Richard Arlen&#x27;s performance and of the ending, which he described as &quot;like so many screen stories, much too sentimental, and there is far more of it than one wants.&quot;

By June 1932, &quot;Wings&quot; had earned $3.6 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 93% based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Subsequent war epics may have borrowed heavily from the original Best Picture winner, but they&#x27;ve all lacked Clara Bow&#x27;s luminous screen presence and William Wellman&#x27;s deft direction.&quot;

===Accolades===
On May 16, 1929, the first Academy Award ceremony was held at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood to honor outstanding film achievements of 1927–1928. &quot;Wings&quot; was entered in a number of categories and was the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (then called &quot;Best Picture, Production&quot;) and Best Engineering Effects for Roy Pomeroy for the year. It remains the only silent film to win Best Picture.

&quot;&quot;, which won Unique and Artistic Production, was considered an equal top winner of the night but the following year, the Academy dropped the Unique and Artistic Production award and decided retroactively that the award won by &quot;Wings&quot; was the highest honor that could be awarded. The statuette, not yet known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;, was presented by Douglas Fairbanks to Clara Bow on behalf of the producers, Adolph Zukor and B.P. Schulberg.

==Legacy==

The Cross and Cockade, a World War I pilots association, decided to host a tribute to &quot;Wings&quot; in 1968. They found Paramount did not even have photos. They recreated stock film, reprinted the picture and had a retrospective inviting the director and stars Richard Arlen and Buddy Rogers. The brochure was available for a small period of years but is reprinted in a book narrated by Richard Arlen, published by Judy Watson, titled &quot;Wings and other Recollections of Early Hollywood&quot; and .

For many years, &quot;Wings&quot; was considered a lost film until a print was found in the Cinémathèque Française film archive in Paris and quickly copied from nitrate film to safety film stock. It was again shown in theaters, including some theaters where the film was accompanied by Wurlitzer pipe organs.

In retrospect, film scholar Scott Eyman in his 1997 book &quot;The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution 1926–1930&quot; highlights both the diverse structure and adapted aspects of &quot;Wings&quot; in that transitional period in American cinematography:

In 1997, &quot;Wings&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2006, director Wellman&#x27;s son, William Wellman Jr., authored a book about the film and his father&#x27;s participation in the making of it, titled &quot;The Man and His Wings: William A. Wellman and the Making of the First Best Picture.&quot;

The film was the focus of an episode of the television series &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; that originally aired November 9, 1968, the show&#x27;s sixth season. Arlen and Rogers were scheduled to appear during the film&#x27;s opening at one of the local cinemas in 1928. They opted instead to attend the New York screening that was held the same night. Uncle Joe writes a letter chiding the pair for forsaking the town. To atone and generate publicity, they agreed to attend a second opening, 40 years later. This episode features actual clips from the movie.

Arlen and Rogers also appeared together as themselves on a December 18, 1967, episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; titled &quot;Lucy and Carol Burnett: Part 2&quot;. They are introduced as the stars of &quot;Wings&quot; at a ceremony to mark the graduation of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett from stewardess training. They appear on stage beneath stills taken from the film and later in the ceremony, star in a musical with Ball and Burnett, as two World War I pilots.

==Restoration==
As the original negatives are lost, the closest to an original copy is a spare negative rediscovered in Paramount&#x27;s vaults subsequent to the Cinémathèque Française print. Suffering from decay and defects, the negative was fully restored with modern technology. The original synchronized soundtrack to the sound version survives at UCLA. For the restored version of &quot;Wings&quot;, it was decided not to use the original, now public-domain, synchronized score so that a new modern soundtrack could be used. The original music score was re-orchestrated. The sound effects were recreated at Skywalker Sound using archived audio tracks. The scenes using the Handschiegl color process were also recreated for the restored version.

The first restored version was released on Laserdisc in the US in 1985, was one of the earliest discs with digital sound, and featured an organ score by Gaylord Carter. This version would be released in a double feature with &quot;The Big Parade&quot; for its Japanese Laserdisc release.

In 1996, Paramount issued a VHS release. In 2012, the company issued a &quot;meticulously restored&quot; version for DVD and Blu-ray. The remastered version in high definition coincided with the centennial anniversary of Paramount. It opens with a logo montage, which starts with the 2010–2013 version of the previous logo or the 2011–2012 &quot;100 Years&quot; version of the current logo and looks back at previous logos from the past 100 years, starting with the 1990 version of the 1986 logo, up into the opening logo of the film. On May 2 and 16, 2012, select Cinemark theaters screened an exclusive limited re-release twice daily to coincide with the film&#x27;s 85th anniversary. It received a worldwide limited release for its 90th anniversary celebration.

The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with the Library of Congress and Paramount Pictures, in 2002.

The sound version of the film was created late in 1928 due to the public&#x27;s apathy towards silent films and therefore this was the version that most audiences saw back in 1928 and 1929. Even though the original synchronized soundtrack survives at UCLA it has not yet been restored to the film and released.

<text>The Racket is a 1928 American silent crime drama film directed by Lewis Milestone and starring Thomas Meighan, Marie Prevost, Louis Wolheim, and George E. Stone. The film was produced by Howard Hughes, written by Bartlett Cormack and Tom Miranda, and was distributed by Paramount Pictures. It was adapted from Cormack&#x27;s 1927 Broadway play &quot;The Racket&quot;.
== Plot ==
Chicago Police Department officer James &quot;Mac&quot; McQuigg tries to keep the peace in Chicago during the Prohibition gang wars but is hampered by massive corruption. After a shootout McQuigg manages to arrest mob boss Nick Scarsi&#x27;s henchman Spike Corcoran, the political boss &quot;The Old Man&quot; arranges to have all charges dropped. After a birthday party for Nick Scarsi&#x27;s younger brother Joe Scarsi ends in a shootout in which Nick Scarsi kills Corcoran, McQuigg arrests Nick Scarsi for murder but is forced to release him after being unable to find the murder weapon.

Although McQuigg vows to bring down Nick Scarsi, he gets transferred to &quot;the sticks&quot; of the 28th precinct. After Joe Scarsi is arrested for a hit-and-run accident, McQuigg convinces his girlfriend Helen Hayes to implicate him. Nick Scarsi arrives and shoots the witness Patrolman Johnson, and McQuigg arrests him again for murder. When Nick Scarsi&#x27;s attorney arrives with a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to free him, McQuigg rips it up and imprisons him as well. Hayes falls in love with cub reporter Dave Ames, and tricks Nick Scarsi into confessing to keep him from killing Ames. With Nick Scarsi implicated in a crime, &quot;The Old Man&quot; and District Attorney Welch&#x27;s political machine turn on Nick Scarsi in order to remain in power at the upcoming municipal election. They trick him into attempting to escape and trying to shoot McQuigg with an empty gun before killing him themselves.

==Background==
Due to the controversial portrayal of a corrupt police force and city government, both the film and the play were banned at the time in Chicago. The main antagonist Nick Scarsi was modeled after Al Capone while &quot;The Old Man&quot; was modeled after Chicago Mayor William Hale &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson.

==Reception==

&quot;The Racket&quot; is one of the films nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture (then called Outstanding Picture) in the 1929 Academy Awards.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100 percent based on 6 critics, with an average rating of 7.50 out of 10.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;A good story, plus good direction, plus a great cast and minus dumb supervision, is responsible for another great underworld film&quot;.

==Preservation==
Only one copy of the film was known to exist. It was long thought lost before being located in Howard Hughes&#x27; film collection after his death. &quot;The Racket&quot; was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016. It airs occasionally on Turner Classic Movies.

==Remake==
The Howard Hughes-owned RKO studios remade &quot;The Racket&quot; in 1951 with Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan in the lead roles.

<text>Decompression sickness (DCS; also called divers&#x27; disease, the bends, aerobullosis, and caisson disease) is a medical condition caused by dissolved gases emerging from solution as bubbles inside the body tissues during decompression. DCS most commonly occurs during or soon after a decompression ascent from underwater diving, but can also result from other causes of depressurisation, such as emerging from a caisson, decompression from saturation, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at high altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.

Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body, DCS can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death. DCS often causes air bubbles to settle in major joints like knees or elbows, causing individuals to bend over in excruciating pain, hence its common name, the bends. Individual susceptibility can vary from day to day, and different individuals under the same conditions may be affected differently or not at all. The classification of types of DCS according to symptoms has evolved since its original description in the 19th century. The severity of symptoms varies from barely noticeable to rapidly fatal.

Decompression sickness can occur after an exposure to increased pressure while breathing a gas with a metabolically inert component, then decompressing too fast for it to be harmlessly eliminated through respiration, or by decompression by an upward excursion from a condition of saturation by the inert breathing gas components, or by a combination of these routes. Theoretical decompression risk is controlled by the tissue compartment with the highest inert gas concentration, which for decompression from saturation is the slowest tissue to outgas.

The risk of DCS can be managed through proper decompression procedures, and contracting the condition has become uncommon. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it, and divers almost universally use decompression schedules or dive computers to limit their exposure and to monitor their ascent speed. If DCS is suspected, it is treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber. Where a chamber is not accessible within a reasonable time frame, in-water recompression may be indicated for a narrow range of presentations, if there are suitably skilled personnel and appropriate equipment available on site. Diagnosis is confirmed by a positive response to the treatment. Early treatment results in a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.

== Classification ==
DCS is classified by symptoms. The earliest descriptions of DCS used the terms: &quot;bends&quot; for joint or skeletal pain; &quot;chokes&quot; for breathing problems; and &quot;staggers&quot; for neurological problems. In 1960, Golding &quot;et al.&quot; introduced a simpler classification using the term &quot;Type I (&#x27;simple&#x27;)&quot; for symptoms involving only the skin, musculoskeletal system, or lymphatic system, and &quot;Type II (&#x27;serious&#x27;)&quot; for symptoms where other organs (such as the central nervous system) are involved. Type II DCS is considered more serious and usually has worse outcomes. This system, with minor modifications, may still be used today. Following changes to treatment methods, this classification is now much less useful in diagnosis, since neurological symptoms may develop after the initial presentation, and both Type I and Type II DCS have the same initial management.

=== Decompression illness and dysbarism ===
The term dysbarism encompasses decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, and barotrauma, whereas decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism are commonly classified together as decompression illness when a precise diagnosis cannot be made. DCS and arterial gas embolism are treated very similarly because they are both the result of gas bubbles in the body. The U.S. Navy prescribes identical treatment for Type II DCS and arterial gas embolism. Their spectra of symptoms also overlap, although the symptoms from arterial gas embolism are generally more severe because they often arise from an infarction (blockage of blood supply and tissue death).

== Signs and symptoms ==

While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain (&quot;the bends&quot;) accounts for about 60% to 70% of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site for altitude and bounce diving, and the knees and hip joints for saturation and compressed air work. Neurological symptoms are present in 10% to 15% of DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances being the most common symptom. Skin manifestations are present in about 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS (&quot;the chokes&quot;) is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre-breathing protocols. The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types.

=== Frequency ===
The relative frequencies of different symptoms of DCS observed by the U.S. Navy are as follows:
=== Onset ===
Although onset of DCS can occur rapidly after a dive, in more than half of all cases symptoms do not begin to appear for at least an hour. In extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed. The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International, a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that documents time to onset of first symptoms. The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.
== Causes ==

DCS is caused by a reduction in ambient pressure that results in the formation of bubbles of inert gases within tissues of the body. It may happen when leaving a high-pressure environment, ascending from depth, or ascending to altitude. A closely related condition of bubble formation in body tissues due to isobaric counterdiffusion can occur with no change of pressure.

=== Ascent from depth ===
DCS is best known as a diving disorder that affects divers having breathed gas that is at a higher pressure than the surface pressure, owing to the pressure of the surrounding water. The risk of DCS increases when diving for extended periods or at greater depth, without ascending gradually and making the decompression stops needed to slowly reduce the excess pressure of inert gases dissolved in the body. The specific risk factors are not well understood and some divers may be more susceptible than others under identical conditions. DCS has been confirmed in rare cases of breath-holding divers who have made a sequence of many deep dives with short surface intervals, and may be the cause of the disease called taravana by South Pacific island natives who for centuries have dived by breath-holding for food and pearls.

Two principal factors control the risk of a diver developing DCS:

# the rate and duration of gas absorption under pressure – the deeper or longer the dive the more gas is absorbed into body tissue in higher concentrations than normal (Henry&#x27;s Law);
# the rate and duration of outgassing on depressurization – the faster the ascent and the shorter the interval between dives the less time there is for absorbed gas to be offloaded safely through the lungs, causing these gases to come out of solution and form &quot;micro bubbles&quot; in the blood.

Even when the change in pressure causes no immediate symptoms, rapid pressure change can cause permanent bone injury called dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON). DON can develop from a single exposure to rapid decompression.

=== Leaving a high-pressure environment ===
When workers leave a pressurized caisson or a mine that has been pressurized to keep water out, they will experience a significant reduction in ambient pressure. A similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space-walk or extra-vehicular activity, where the pressure in their spacesuit is lower than the pressure in the vehicle.

The original name for DCS was &quot;caisson disease&quot;. This term was introduced in the 19th century, when caissons under pressure were used to keep water from flooding large engineering excavations below the water table, such as bridge supports and tunnels. Workers spending time in high ambient pressure conditions are at risk when they return to the lower pressure outside the caisson if the pressure is not reduced slowly. DCS was a major factor during construction of Eads Bridge, when 15 workers died from what was then a mysterious illness, and later during construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, where it incapacitated the project leader Washington Roebling. On the other side of the Manhattan island during construction of the Hudson River Tunnel, contractor&#x27;s agent Ernest William Moir noted in 1889 that workers were dying due to decompression sickness; Moir pioneered the use of an airlock chamber for treatment.

=== Ascent to altitude and loss of pressure from a pressurised environment===
The most common health risk on ascent to altitude is not decompression sickness but altitude sickness, or acute mountain sickness (AMS), which has an entirely different and unrelated set of causes and symptoms. AMS results not from the formation of bubbles from dissolved gasses in the body but from exposure to a low partial pressure of oxygen and alkalosis. However, passengers in unpressurized aircraft at high altitude may also be at some risk of DCS.

Altitude DCS became a problem in the 1930s with the development of high-altitude balloon and aircraft flights but not as great a problem as AMS, which drove the development of pressurized cabins, which coincidentally controlled DCS. Commercial aircraft are now required to maintain the cabin at or below a pressure altitude of even when flying above . Symptoms of DCS in healthy individuals are subsequently very rare unless there is a loss of pressurization or the individual has been diving recently. Divers who drive up a mountain or fly shortly after diving are at particular risk even in a pressurized aircraft because the regulatory cabin altitude of represents only 73% of sea level pressure.

Generally, the higher the altitude the greater the risk of altitude DCS but there is no specific, maximum, safe altitude below which it never occurs. There are very few symptoms at or below unless the person had predisposing medical conditions or had dived recently. There is a correlation between increased altitudes above and the frequency of altitude DCS but there is no direct relationship with the severity of the various types of DCS. A US Air Force study reports that there are few occurrences between and and 87% of incidents occurred at or above . High-altitude parachutists may reduce the risk of altitude DCS if they flush nitrogen from the body by pre-breathing pure oxygen. A similar procedure is used by astronauts and cosmonauts preparing for extravehicular activity in low pressure space suits.

== Predisposing factors ==

Although the occurrence of DCS is not easily predictable, many predisposing factors are known. They may be considered as either environmental or individual. Decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving are associated with certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.

=== Environmental ===
The following environmental factors have been shown to increase the risk of DCS:
* the magnitude of the pressure reduction ratio – a large pressure reduction ratio is more likely to cause DCS than a small one.
* repetitive exposures – repetitive dives within a short period of time (a few hours) increase the risk of developing DCS. Repetitive ascents to altitudes above within similar short periods increase the risk of developing altitude DCS.
* the rate of ascent – the faster the ascent the greater the risk of developing DCS. The &quot;U.S. Navy Diving Manual&quot; indicates that ascent rates greater than about when diving increase the chance of DCS, while recreational dive tables such as the Bühlmann tables require an ascent rate of with the last taking at least one minute. An individual exposed to a rapid decompression (high rate of ascent) above has a greater risk of altitude DCS than being exposed to the same altitude but at a lower rate of ascent.
* the duration of exposure – the longer the duration of the dive, the greater is the risk of DCS. Longer flights, especially to altitudes of and above, carry a greater risk of altitude DCS.
* underwater diving before flying – divers who ascend to altitude soon after a dive increase their risk of developing DCS even if the dive itself was within the dive table safe limits. Dive tables make provisions for post-dive time at surface level before flying to allow any residual excess nitrogen to outgas. However, the pressure maintained inside even a pressurized aircraft may be as low as the pressure equivalent to an altitude of above sea level. Therefore, the assumption that the dive table surface interval occurs at normal atmospheric pressure is invalidated by flying during that surface interval, and an otherwise-safe dive may then exceed the dive table limits.
* diving before travelling to altitude – DCS can occur without flying if the person moves to a high-altitude location on land immediately after diving, for example, scuba divers in Eritrea who drive from the coast to the Asmara plateau at increase their risk of DCS.
* diving at altitude – diving in water whose surface pressure is significantly below sea level pressure – for example, Lake Titicaca is at . Versions of decompression tables for altitudes exceeding , or dive computers with high-altitude settings or surface pressure sensors may be used to reduce this risk.

=== Individual ===
The following individual factors have been identified as possibly contributing to increased risk of DCS:
* dehydration – Studies by Walder concluded that decompression sickness could be reduced in aviators when the serum surface tension was raised by drinking isotonic saline, and the high surface tension of water is generally regarded as helpful in controlling bubble size. Maintaining proper hydration is recommended. There is no convincing evidence that overhydration has any benefits, and it is implicated in immersion pulmonary oedema.
* patent foramen ovale – a hole between the atrial chambers of the heart in the fetus is normally closed by a flap with the first breaths at birth. In about 20% of adults the flap does not completely seal, however, allowing blood through the hole when coughing or during activities that raise chest pressure. In diving, this can allow venous blood with microbubbles of inert gas to bypass the lungs, where the bubbles would otherwise be filtered out by the lung capillary system, and return directly to the arterial system (including arteries to the brain, spinal cord and heart). In the arterial system, bubbles (arterial gas embolism) are far more dangerous because they block circulation and cause infarction (tissue death, due to local loss of blood flow). In the brain, infarction results in stroke, and in the spinal cord it may result in paralysis.
* a person&#x27;s age – there are some reports indicating a higher risk of altitude DCS with increasing age.
* previous injury – there is some indication that recent joint or limb injuries may predispose individuals to developing decompression-related bubbles.
* temperature – there is some evidence suggesting that individual exposure to very cold ambient temperatures may increase the risk of altitude DCS. Decompression sickness risk can be reduced by increased ambient temperature during decompression following dives in cold water, though risk is also increased by ingassing while the diver is warm and peripherally well-perfused, and decompressing when the diver is cold.
* body type – typically, a person who has a high body fat content is at greater risk of DCS. This is because nitrogen is five times more soluble in fat than in water, leading to greater amounts of total body dissolved nitrogen during time at pressure. Fat represents about 15–25 percent of a healthy adult&#x27;s body, but stores about half of the total amount of nitrogen (about 1 litre) at normal pressures.
* alcohol consumption – although alcohol consumption increases dehydration and therefore may increase susceptibility to DCS, a 2005 study found no evidence that alcohol consumption increases the incidence of DCS.

== Mechanism ==
Depressurisation causes inert gases, which were dissolved under higher pressure, to come out of physical solution and form gas bubbles within the body. These bubbles produce the symptoms of decompression sickness. Bubbles may form whenever the body experiences a reduction in pressure, but not all bubbles result in DCS. The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is described by Henry&#x27;s Law, which indicates that when the pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid is decreased, the amount of that gas dissolved in the liquid will also decrease proportionately.

On ascent from a dive, inert gas comes out of solution in a process called &quot;outgassing&quot; or &quot;offgassing&quot;. Under normal conditions, most offgassing occurs by gas exchange in the lungs. If inert gas comes out of solution too quickly to allow outgassing in the lungs then bubbles may form in the blood or within the solid tissues of the body. The formation of bubbles in the skin or joints results in milder symptoms, while large numbers of bubbles in the venous blood can cause lung damage. The most severe types of DCS interruptand ultimately damagespinal cord function, leading to paralysis, sensory dysfunction, or death. In the presence of a right-to-left shunt of the heart, such as a patent foramen ovale, venous bubbles may enter the arterial system, resulting in an arterial gas embolism. A similar effect, known as ebullism, may occur during explosive decompression, when water vapour forms bubbles in body fluids due to a dramatic reduction in environmental pressure.

=== Inert gases ===
The main inert gas in air is nitrogen, but nitrogen is not the only gas that can cause DCS. Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which can also cause decompression sickness. Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause narcosis, it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving.
There is some debate as to the decompression requirements for helium during short-duration dives. Most divers do longer decompressions; however, some groups like the WKPP have been experimenting with the use of shorter decompression times by including deep stops. The balance of evidence as of 2020 does not indicate that deep stops increase decompression efficiency.

Any inert gas that is breathed under pressure can form bubbles when the ambient pressure decreases. Very deep dives have been made using hydrogen–oxygen mixtures (hydrox), but controlled decompression is still required to avoid DCS.

=== Isobaric counterdiffusion ===
DCS can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas. This is known as isobaric counterdiffusion, and presents a problem for very deep dives. For example, after using a very helium-rich trimix at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in &quot;fast&quot; tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) actually increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect.

=== Bubble formation ===
The location of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces make and break contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface in contact with the liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.

Once microbubbles have formed, they can grow by either a reduction in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a blood vessel and the rate of delivery of blood to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.

=== Pathophysiology ===
The primary provoking agent in decompression sickness is bubble formation from excess dissolved gases. Various hypotheses have been put forward for the nucleation and growth of bubbles in tissues, and for the level of supersaturation which will support bubble growth. The earliest bubble formation detected is subclinical intravascular bubbles detectable by doppler ultrasound in the venous systemic circulation. The presence of these &quot;silent&quot; bubbles is no guarantee that they will persist and grow to be symptomatic.

Vascular bubbles formed in the systemic capillaries may be trapped in the lung capillaries, temporarily blocking them. If this is severe, the symptom called &quot;chokes&quot; may occur. If the diver has a patent foramen ovale (or a shunt in the pulmonary circulation), bubbles may pass through it and bypass the pulmonary circulation to enter the arterial blood. If these bubbles are not absorbed in the arterial plasma and lodge in systemic capillaries they will block the flow of oxygenated blood to the tissues supplied by those capillaries, and those tissues will be starved of oxygen. Moon and Kisslo (1988) concluded that &quot;the evidence suggests that the risk of serious neurological DCI or early onset DCI is increased in divers with a resting right–to-left shunt through a PFO. There is, at present, no evidence that PFO is related to mild or late onset bends. Bubbles form within other tissues as well as the blood vessels. Inert gas can diffuse into bubble nuclei between tissues. In this case, the bubbles can distort and permanently damage the tissue. As they grow, the bubbles may also compress nerves, causing pain. Extravascular or autochthonous bubbles usually form in slow tissues such as joints, tendons and muscle sheaths. Direct expansion causes tissue damage, with the release of histamines and their associated affects. Biochemical damage may be as important as, or more important than mechanical effects.

Bubble size and growth may be affected by several factors – gas exchange with adjacent tissues, the presence of surfactants, coalescence and disintegration by collision. Vascular bubbles may cause direct blockage, aggregate platelets and red blood cells, and trigger the coagulation process, causing local and downstream clotting.

Arteries may be blocked by intravascular fat aggregation. Platelets accumulate in the vicinity of bubbles. Endothelial damage may be a mechanical effect of bubble pressure on the vessel walls, a toxic effect of stabilised platelet aggregates and possibly toxic effects due to the association of lipids with the air bubbles. Protein molecules may be denatured by reorientation of the secondary and tertiary structure when non-polar groups protrude into the bubble gas and hydrophilic groups remain in the surrounding blood, which may generate a cascade of pathophysiological events with consequent production of clinical signs of decompression sickness.

The physiological effects of a reduction in environmental pressure depend on the rate of bubble growth, the site, and surface activity. A sudden release of sufficient pressure in saturated tissue results in a complete disruption of cellular organelles, while a more gradual reduction in pressure may allow accumulation of a smaller number of larger bubbles, some of which may not produce clinical signs, but still cause physiological effects typical of a blood/gas interface and mechanical effects. Gas is dissolved in all tissues, but decompression sickness is only clinically recognised in the central nervous system, bone, ears, teeth, skin and lungs.

Necrosis has frequently been reported in the lower cervical, thoracic, and upper lumbar regions of the spinal cord. A catastrophic pressure reduction from saturation produces explosive mechanical disruption of cells by local effervescence, while a more gradual pressure loss tends to produce discrete bubbles accumulated in the white matter, surrounded by a protein layer. Typical acute spinal decompression injury occurs in the columns of white matter. Infarcts are characterised by a region of oedema, haemorrhage and early myelin degeneration, and are typically centred on small blood vessels. The lesions are generally discrete. Oedema usually extends to the adjacent grey matter. Microthrombi are found in the blood vessels associated with the infarcts.

Following the acute changes there is an invasion of lipid phagocytes and degeneration of adjacent neural fibres with vascular hyperplasia at the edges of the infarcts. The lipid phagocytes are later replaced by a cellular reaction of astrocytes. Vessels in surrounding areas remain patent but are collagenised. Distribution of spinal cord lesions may be related to vascular supply. There is still uncertainty regarding the aetiology of decompression sickness damage to the spinal cord.

Dysbaric osteonecrosis lesions are typically bilateral and usually occur at both ends of the femur and at the proximal end of the humerus. Symptoms are usually only present when a joint surface is involved, which typically does not occur until a long time after the causative exposure to a hyperbaric environment. The initial damage is attributed to the formation of bubbles, and one episode can be sufficient, however incidence is sporadic and generally associated with relatively long periods of hyperbaric exposure and aetiology is uncertain. Early identification of lesions by radiography is not possible, but over time areas of radiographic opacity develop in association with the damaged bone.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of decompression sickness relies almost entirely on clinical presentation, as there are no laboratory tests that can incontrovertibly confirm or reject the diagnosis. Various blood tests have been proposed, but they are not specific for decompression sickness, they are of uncertain utility and are not in general use.

Decompression sickness should be suspected if any of the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. This window can be extended to 36 hours for ascent to altitude and 48 hours for prolonged exposure to altitude following diving. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.

===Test of pressure===

There is no gold standard for diagnosis, and DCI experts are rare. Most of the chambers open to treatment of recreational divers and reporting to Diver&#x27;s Alert Network see fewer than 10 cases per year, making it difficult for the attending doctors to develop experience in diagnosis. A method used by commercial diving supervisors when considering whether to recompress as first aid when they have a chamber on site, is known as the &quot;test of pressure&quot;. The diver is checked for contraindications to recompression, and if none are present, recompressed. If the symptoms resolve or reduce during recompression, it is considered likely that a treatment schedule will be effective. The test is not entirely reliable, and both false positives and false negatives are possible, however in the commercial diving environment it is often considered worth treating when there is doubt, and very early recompression has a history of very high success rates and reduced number of treatments needed for complete resolution and minimal sequelae.

===Differential diagnosis===

Symptoms of DCS and arterial gas embolism can be virtually indistinguishable. The most reliable way to tell the difference is based on the dive profile followed, as the probability of DCS depends on duration of exposure and magnitude of pressure, whereas AGE depends entirely on the performance of the ascent. In many cases it is not possible to distinguish between the two, but as the treatment is the same in such cases it does not usually matter.

Other conditions which may be confused include skin symptoms. &quot;Cutis marmorata&quot; due to DCS may be confused with skin barotrauma due to dry suit squeeze, for which no treatment is necessary. Dry suit squeeze produces lines of redness with possible bruising where the skin was pinched between folds of the suit, while the mottled effect of &quot;cutis marmorata&quot; is usually on skin where there is subcutaneous fat, and has no linear pattern.

Transient episodes of severe neurological incapacitation with rapid spontaneous recovery shortly after a dive may be attributed to hypothermia, but may actually be symptomatic of short term CNS involvement due to bubbles which form a short term gas embolism, then resolve, but which may leave residual problems which may cause relapses. These cases are thought to be under-diagnosed.

Inner ear decompression sickness (IEDCS) can be confused with inner ear barotrauma (IEBt), alternobaric vertigo, caloric vertigo and reverse squeeze. A history of difficulty in equalising the ears during the dive makes ear barotrauma more likely, but does not always eliminate the possibility of inner ear DCS, which is usually associated with deep, mixed gas dives with decompression stops. Both conditions may exist concurrently, and it can be difficult to distinguish whether a person has IEDCS, IEBt, or both.

Numbness and tingling are associated with spinal DCS, but can also be caused by pressure on nerves (compression neurapraxia). In DCS the numbness or tingling is generally confined to one or a series of dermatomes, while pressure on a nerve tends to produce characteristic areas of numbness associated with the specific nerve on only one side of the body distal to the pressure point. A loss of strength or function is likely to be a medical emergency. A loss of feeling that lasts more than a minute or two indicates a need for immediate medical attention. It is only partial sensory changes, or paraesthesias, where this distinction between trivial and more serious injuries applies.

Large areas of numbness with associated weakness or paralysis, especially if a whole limb is affected, are indicative of probable brain involvement and require urgent medical attention. Paraesthesias or weakness involving a dermatome indicate probable spinal cord or spinal nerve root involvement. Although it is possible that this may have other causes, such as an injured intervertebral disk, these symptoms indicate an urgent need for medical assessment. In combination with weakness, paralysis or loss of bowel or bladder control, they indicate a medical emergency.

== Prevention ==
=== Underwater diving ===

To prevent the excess formation of bubbles that can lead to decompression sickness, divers limit their ascent rate—the recommended ascent rate used by popular decompression models is about per minute—and follow a decompression schedule as necessary. This schedule may require the diver to ascend to a particular depth, and remain at that depth until sufficient inert gas has been eliminated from the body to allow further ascent. Each of these is termed a &quot;decompression stop&quot;, and a schedule for a given bottom time and depth may contain one or more stops, or none at all. Dives that contain no decompression stops are called &quot;no-stop dives&quot;, but divers usually schedule a short &quot;safety stop&quot; at , depending on the training agency or dive computer.

The decompression schedule may be derived from decompression tables, decompression software, or from dive computers, and these are generally based upon a mathematical model of the body&#x27;s uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes. These models, such as the Bühlmann decompression algorithm, are modified to fit empirical data and provide a decompression schedule for a given depth and dive duration using a specified breathing gas mixture.

Since divers on the surface after a dive may still have excess inert gas in their bodies, decompression from any subsequent dive before this excess is eliminated needs to modify the schedule to take account of the residual gas load from the previous dive. This will result in a shorter allowable time under water without obligatory decompression stops, or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive. The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.

Decompression time can be significantly shortened by breathing mixtures containing much less inert gas during the decompression phase of the dive (or pure oxygen at stops in of water or less). The reason is that the inert gas outgases at a rate proportional to the difference between the partial pressure of inert gas in the diver&#x27;s body and its partial pressure in the breathing gas; whereas the likelihood of bubble formation depends on the difference between the inert gas partial pressure in the diver&#x27;s body and the ambient pressure. Reduction in decompression requirements can also be gained by breathing a nitrox mix during the dive, since less nitrogen will be taken into the body than during the same dive done on air.

Following a decompression schedule does not completely protect against DCS. The algorithms used are designed to reduce the probability of DCS to a very low level, but do not reduce it to zero. The mathematical implications of all current decompression models are that provided that no tissue is ingassing, longer decompression stops will decrease decompression risk, or at worst not increase it. Efficient decompression requires the diver to ascend fast enough to establish as high a decompression gradient, in as many tissues, as safely possible, without provoking the development of symptomatic bubbles. This is facilitated by the highest acceptably safe oxygen partial pressure in the breathing gas, and avoiding gas changes that could cause counterdiffusion bubble formation or growth. The development of schedules that are both safe and efficient has been complicated by the large number of variables and uncertainties, including personal variation in response under varying environmental conditions and workload, attributed to variations of body type, fitness and other risk factors.

=== Exposure to altitude ===
One of the most significant breakthroughs in the prevention of altitude DCS is oxygen pre-breathing. Breathing pure oxygen significantly reduces the nitrogen loads in body tissues by reducing the partial pressure of nitrogen in the lungs, which induces diffusion of nitrogen from the blood into the breathing gas, and this effect eventually lowers the concentration of nitrogen in the other tissues of the body. If continued for long enough, and without interruption, this provides effective protection upon exposure to low-barometric pressure environments. However, breathing pure oxygen during flight alone (ascent, en route, descent) does not decrease the risk of altitude DCS as the time required for ascent is generally not sufficient to significantly desaturate the slower tissues.

Pure aviator oxygen which has moisture removed to prevent freezing of valves at altitude is readily available and routinely used in general aviation mountain flying and at high altitudes. Most small general aviation aircraft are not pressurized, therefore oxygen use is an FAA requirement at higher altitudes.

Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an effective method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive for the protection of civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.

Astronauts aboard the International Space Station preparing for extra-vehicular activity (EVA) &quot;camp out&quot; at low atmospheric pressure, , spending eight sleeping hours in the Quest airlock chamber before their spacewalk. During the EVA they breathe 100% oxygen in their spacesuits, which operate at , although research has examined the possibility of using 100% O2 at in the suits to lessen the pressure reduction, and hence the risk of DCS.

== Treatment ==


Recompression on air was shown to be an effective treatment for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909. Evidence of the effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and Behnke, and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS. Recompression is normally carried out in a recompression chamber. At a dive site, a riskier alternative is in-water recompression.

Oxygen first aid has been used as an emergency treatment for diving injuries for years. Particularly if given within the first four hours of surfacing, it increases the success of recompression therapy as well as decreasing the number of recompression treatments required. Most fully closed-circuit diving rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen-rich breathing gas and could be used as a means of supplying oxygen if dedicated equipment is not available.

It is beneficial to give fluids, as this helps reduce dehydration. It is no longer recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised to do so by medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant&#x27;s maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.

===First aid===

All cases of decompression sickness should be treated initially with the highest available concentration of oxygen until hyperbaric oxygen therapy (100% oxygen delivered in a hyperbaric chamber) can be provided. Mild cases of the &quot;bends&quot; and some skin symptoms may disappear during descent from high altitude; however, it is recommended that these cases still be evaluated. Neurological symptoms, pulmonary symptoms, and mottled or marbled skin lesions should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy if seen within 10 to 14 days of development. Early recompression has a history of better outcomes and less treatment being needed.

Normobaric oxygen administered at as close to 100% as practicable is known to be beneficial based on observed bubble reduction and symptom resolution. For this reason diver training in oxygen administration, and a system for administering a high percentage of inspired oxygen at quantities sufficient for plausible evacuation scenarios is desirable. Where oxygenation may be compromised the administration rate should be adjusted to ensure that the best practicable supplementation is maintained until supplies can be replenished.

A horizontal position is preferable during evacuation if possible, with the recovery position recommended for unconscious divers, as there is evidence that inert gas washout is improved in horizontal subjects, and that large arterial bubbles tend to distribute towards the head in upright positions. A head down position is thought to be harmful in DCS.

Oral hydration is recommended in fully conscious persons, and fluids should ideally be isotonic, without alcohol, carbonation or caffeine, as diving is known to cause dehydration, and rehydration is known to reduce post-dive venous gas emboli.

Intravascular rehydration is recommended if suitably competent responders are present. Glucose free isotonic crystalloid solutions are preferred. Case evidence shows that aggressive rehydration can be life-saving in severe cases.

If there are no contraindications, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug along with hyperbatic oxygen is likely to improve rate of recovery. The most prominent NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen; all available over the counter in most countries. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally not considered an NSAID because it has only minor anti-inflammatory activity.Corticosteroids, pentoxyphylline, aspirin, lidocaine and nicergoline have been used in early management of DCS, but there is insufficient evidence on their effectiveness.

Divers should be kept comfortably warm, as warm subjects are known to eliminate gas more quickly, but overheating aggravates neurological injury.

===Delay of recompression===

Observational evidence shows that outcomes after recompression are likely to be better after immediate recompression, which is only possible when on-site recompression is possible, although the 2004 workshop on decompression came to the conclusion that for cases with mild symptoms, a delay before recompression is unlikely to cause any worsening of long-term outcomes.

In more serious cases recompression should be done as soon as safely possible. There is some evidence that delays longer than six hours result in slower or less complete recovery, and the number of treatments required may be increased.

===Transport of a symptomatic diver===
Exposing a case of decompression sickness to reduced ambient pressure will cause the bubbles to expand if not constrained by a rigid local tissue environment. This can aggravate the symptoms, and should be avoided if reasonably practicable. If a diver with DCS is transported by air, cabin pressure should be kept as close to sea level atmospheric pressure as possible, preferably not more than 150 m, either by cabin pressurisation or by remaining at low altitude throughout the flight. The risk of deterioration at higher altitudes must be considered against the risk of deterioration if not transported. Some divers with symptoms or signs of mild decompression sickness may be evacuated by pressurised commercial airliner for further treatment after a surface interval of at least 24 hours. The 2004 workshop considered it unlikely for this to cause a worse outcome. Most experience has been for short flights of less than two hours. There is little known about the effects of longer flights. Where possible, pre-flight and in-flight oxygen breathing at the highest available percentage is considered best practice. Similar precautions apply to surface transport through higher altitudes.

===In-water recompression===

Recompression and hyperbaric oxygen administered in a recompression chamber is recognised as the definitive treatment for DCI, but when there is no readily available access to a suitable hyperbaric chamber, and if symptoms are significant or progressing, in-water recompression (IWR) with oxygen is a medically recognised option where a group of divers including the symptomatic diver already have relevant training and equipment that provides a sufficient understanding of the associated risks and allows the involved parties to collectively accept responsibility for a decision to proceed with IWR.

In-water recompression (IWR) or underwater oxygen treatment is the emergency treatment of decompression sickness by returning the diver underwater to help the gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve. It is a procedure that exposes the diver to significant risk which should be compared with the risk associated with the other available options. Some authorities recommend that it is only to be used when the time to travel to the nearest recompression chamber is too long to save the victim&#x27;s life, others take a more pragmatic approach, and accept that in some circumstances IWR is the best available option. The risks may not be justified for case of mild symptoms likely to resolve spontaneously, or for cases where the diver is likely to be unsafe in the water, but in-water recompression may be justified in cases where severe outcomes are likely, if conducted by a competent and suitably equipped team.

Carrying out in-water recompression when there is a nearby recompression chamber or without suitable equipment and training is never a desirable option. The risk of the procedure is due to the diver suffering from DCS being seriously ill and may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing while under water. Any one of these events is likely to result in the diver drowning or asphyxiating or suffering further injury during a subsequent rescue to the surface. This risk can be reduced by improving airway security by using surface supplied gas and a helmet or full-face mask.

Several schedules have been published for in-water recompression treatment, but little data on their efficacy is available.

The decision of whether or not to attempt IWR is dependent on identifying the diver whose condition is serious enough to justify the risk, but whose clinical condition does not indicate that the risk is unacceptable. The risk may not be justified for mild DCI, if spontaneous recovery is probable whether the diver is recompressed or not, and surface oxygen is indicated for these cases. However, in these cases the risk of the recompression is also low, and early abandonment is also unlikely to cause further harm.

==== Contraindications ====
Some signs of decompression illness which suggest a risk of permanent injury are nevertheless considered contraindications for IWR. Hearing loss and vertigo displayed in isolation with no other symptoms of DCI can have been caused by inner ear barotrauma rather than DCI, and inner ear barotrauma is generally considered a contraindication for recompression. Even when caused by DCI, vertigo can make in-water treatment hazardous if accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A diver with a deteriorating level of consciousness or with a persisting reduced level of consciousness should also not be recompressed in-water nor should a diver who does not want to go back down, or with a history of oxygen toxicity in the preceding dives, or any physical injury or incapacitation which may make the procedure unsafe.

===Definitive treatment===

The duration of recompression treatment depends on the severity of symptoms, the dive history, the type of recompression therapy used and the patient&#x27;s response to the treatment. One of the more frequently used treatment schedules is the US Navy Table 6, which provides hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a maximum pressure equivalent to of seawater (2.8 bar PO2) for a total time under pressure of 288 minutes, of which 240 minutes are on oxygen and the balance are air breaks to minimise the possibility of oxygen toxicity.

A multiplace chamber is the preferred facility for treatment of decompression sickness as it allows direct physical access to the patient by medical personnel, but monoplace chambers are more widely available and should be used for treatment if a multiplace chamber is not available or transportation would cause significant delay in treatment, as the interval between onset of symptoms and recompression is important to the quality of recovery. It may be necessary to modify the optimum treatment schedule to allow use of a monoplace chamber, but this is usually better than delaying treatment. A US Navy treatment table 5 can be safely performed without air breaks if a built-in breathing system is not available. In most cases the patient can be adequately treated in a monoplace chamber at the receiving hospital.

===Altitude decompression sickness===

Treatment and management may vary depending on the grade or form of decompression sickness and the treating facility or organization. First aid at altitude is oxygen at the highest practicable concentration and earliest and largest practicable reduction in cabin altitude.

Ground-level 100% oxygen therapy is suggested for 2 hours following type-1 decompression sickness that occurs at altitude, if it resolves upon descent. In more severe cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy following standard recompression protocols is indicated. Decompression sickness in aviation most commonly follows flights in non-pressurized aircraft, flights with cabin pressure fluctuations, or in individuals who fly after diving. Cases have also been reported after the use of altitude chambers. These are relatively rare clinical events.

== Prognosis ==
Immediate treatment with 100% oxygen, followed by recompression in a hyperbaric chamber, will in most cases result in no long-term effects. However, permanent long-term injury from DCS is possible. Three-month follow-ups on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14.3% of the 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of Type II DCS, and 7% from Type I DCS. Long-term follow-ups showed similar results, with 16% having permanent neurological sequelae.

Long term effects are dependent on both initial injury, and treatment. While almost all cases will resolve more quickly with treatment, milder cases may resolve adequately over time without recompression, where the damage is minor and the damage is not significantly aggravated by lack of treatment. In some cases the cost, inconvenience, and risk to the patient may make it appropriate not to evacuate to a hyperbaric treatment facility. These cases should be assessed by a specialist in diving medicine, which can generally be done remotely by telephone or internet.

For joint pain, the likely tissues affected depend on the symptoms, and the urgency of hyperbaric treatment will depend largely on the tissues involved.
* Sharp, localised pain that is affected by movement suggests tendon or muscle injury, both of which will usually fully resolve with oxygen and anti-inflammatory medication.
* Sharp, localised pain that is not affected by movement suggests local inflammation, which will also usually fully resolve with oxygen and anti-inflammatory medication.
* Deep, non-localised pain affected by movement suggests joint capsule tension, which is likely to fully resolve with oxygen and anti-inflammatory medication, though recompression will help it to resolve faster.
* Deep, non-localised pain not affected by movement suggests bone medulla involvement, with ischaemia due to blood vessel blockage and swelling inside the bone, which is mechanistically associated with osteonecrosis, and therefore it has been strongly recommended that these symptoms are treated with hyperbaric oxygen.

== Epidemiology ==
The incidence of decompression sickness is rare, estimated at 2.8 to 4 cases per 10,000 dives, with the risk 2.6 times greater for males than females. DCS affects approximately 1,000 U.S. scuba divers per year. In 1999, the Divers Alert Network (DAN) created &quot;Project Dive Exploration&quot; to collect data on dive profiles and incidents. From 1998 to 2002, they recorded 50,150 dives, from which 28 recompressions were requiredalthough these will almost certainly contain incidents of arterial gas embolism (AGE)a rate of about 0.05%.

Around 2013, Honduras had the highest number of decompression-related deaths and disabilities in the world, caused by unsafe practices in lobster diving among the indigenous Miskito people, who face great economic pressures. At that time it was estimated that in the country over 2000 divers had been injured and 300 others had died since the 1970s.

== Timeline ==

* 1670: Robert Boyle demonstrated that a reduction in ambient pressure could lead to bubble formation in living tissue. This description of a bubble forming in the eye of a viper subjected to a near vacuum was the first recorded description of decompression sickness.
* 1769: Giovanni Morgagni described the post mortem findings of air in cerebral circulation and surmised that this was the cause of death.
* 1840: Charles Pasley, who was involved in the recovery of the sunken warship HMS &quot;Royal George&quot;, commented that, of those having made frequent dives, &quot;not a man escaped the repeated attacks of rheumatism and cold&quot;.
* 1841: First documented case of decompression sickness, reported by a mining engineer who observed pain and muscle cramps among coal miners working in mine shafts air-pressurized to keep water out.
* 1854: Decompression sickness reported and one resulting death of caisson workers on the Royal Albert Bridge.
* 1867: Panamanian pearl divers using the revolutionary Sub Marine Explorer submersible repeatedly experienced &quot;fever&quot; due to rapid ascents. Continued sickness led to the vessel&#x27;s abandonment in 1869.
* 1870: Bauer published outcomes of 25 paralyzed caisson workers.
*: From 1870 to 1910, all prominent features were established. Explanations at the time included: cold or exhaustion causing reflex spinal cord damage; electricity cause by friction on compression; or organ congestion; and vascular stasis caused by decompression. 
* 1871: The Eads Bridge in St Louis employed 352 compressed air workers including Alphonse Jaminet as the physician in charge. There were 30 seriously injured and 12 fatalities. Jaminet himself developed decompression sickness and his personal description was the first such recorded. According to Divers Alert Network, in its Inert Gas Exchange, Bubbles and Decompression Theory course, this is where &quot;bends&quot; was first used to refer to DCS.
* 1872: The similarity between decompression sickness and iatrogenic air embolism as well as the relationship between inadequate decompression and decompression sickness was noted by Friedburg. He suggested that intravascular gas was released by rapid decompression and recommended: slow compression and decompression; four-hour working shifts; limit to maximum pressure of 44.1 psig (4 atm); using only healthy workers; and recompression treatment for severe cases.
* 1873: Andrew Smith first used the term &quot;caisson disease&quot; describing 110 cases of decompression sickness as the physician in charge during construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. The project employed 600 compressed air workers. Recompression treatment was not used. The project chief engineer Washington Roebling had caisson disease, and endured the after-effects of the disease for the rest of his life. During this project, decompression sickness became known as &quot;The Grecian Bends&quot; or simply &quot;the bends&quot; because affected individuals characteristically bent forward at the hips: this is possibly reminiscent of a then popular women&#x27;s fashion and dance maneuver known as the Grecian Bend.
* 1890: During construction of the Hudson River Tunnel contractor&#x27;s agent Ernest William Moir pioneered the use of an airlock chamber for treatment.
* 1900: Leonard Hill used a frog model to prove that decompression causes bubbles and that recompression resolves them. Hill advocated linear or uniform decompression profiles. This type of decompression is used today by saturation divers. His work was financed by Augustus Siebe and the Siebe Gorman Company.
* 1904: Tunnel building to and from Manhattan Island caused over 3,000 injuries and over 30 deaths which led to laws requiring PSI limits and decompression rules for &quot;sandhogs&quot; in the United States.
* 1904: Siebe and Gorman in conjunction with Leonard Hill developed and produced a closed bell in which a diver can be decompressed at the surface.

* 1941: Altitude DCS is treated with hyperbaric oxygen for the first time.
* 1944: US Navy published hyperbaric treatment tables &quot;Long Air Recompression Table with Oxygen&quot; and &quot;Short Oxygen Recompression Table&quot;, both using 100% oxygen below 60 fsw (18 msw)
* 1945: Field results showed that the 1944 oxygen treatment table was not yet satisfactory, so a series of tests were conducted by staff from the Navy Medical Research Institute and the Navy Experimental Diving Unit using human subjects to verify and modify the treatment tables. Tests were conducted using the 100-foot air-oxygen treatment table and the 100-foot air treatment table, which were found to be satisfactory. Other tables were extended until they produced satisfactory results. The resulting tables were used as the standard treatment for the next 20 years, and these tables and slight modifications were adopted by other navies and industry. Over time, evidence accumulated that the success of these table for severe decompression sickness was not very good.
* 1957: Robert Workman established a new method for calculation of decompression requirements (M-values).
* 1959: The &quot;SOS Decompression Meter&quot;, a submersible mechanical device that simulated nitrogen uptake and release, was introduced.
* 1960: FC Golding &quot;et al.&quot; split the classification of DCS into Type 1 and 2.
* 1965: Low success rates of the existing US Navy treatment tables led to the development of the oxygen treatment table by Goodman and Workman in 1965, variations of which are still in general use as the definitive treatment for most cases of decompression sickness.
* 1965: LeMessurier and Hills published a paper on &quot;A thermodynamic approach arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques&quot; which suggests that decompression by conventional models results in bubble formation which is then eliminated by re-dissolving at the decompression stops.
* 1976 – M.P. Spencer showed that the sensitivity of decompression testing is increased by the use of ultrasonic methods which can detect mobile venous bubbles before symptoms of DCS emerge.

* 1989: The advent of dive computers had not been widely accepted, but after the 1989 AAUS Dive computer workshop published a group consensus list of recommendations for the use of dive computers in scientific diving, most opposition to dive computers dissipated, numerous new models were introduced, the technology dramatically improved and dive computers became standard scuba diving equipment. Over time, some of the recommendations became irrelevant as the technology improved.
* 2000: HydroSpace Engineering developed the HS Explorer, a Trimix computer with optional PO2 monitoring and twin decompression algorithms, Buhlmann, and the first full real time RGBM implementation.

* By 2010: The use of dive computers for decompression status tracking was virtually ubiquitous among recreational divers and widespread in scientific diving.
* 2018: A group of diving medical experts issued a consensus guideline on pre-hospital decompression sickness management and concluded that in-water recompression is a valid and effective emergency treatment where a chamber is not available, but is only appropriate in groups that have been trained and are competent in the skills required for IWR and have appropriate equipment.
* 2023: The animal rights group, PETA, says that it has successfully lobbied the Navy to end a pair of studies that involved subjecting sheep to conditions that simulated surfacing quickly from a great depth, causing them pain and sometimes leaving the animals paralyzed or dead.

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
In the United States, it is common for medical insurance not to cover treatment for the bends that is the result of recreational diving. This is because scuba diving is considered an elective and &quot;high-risk&quot; activity and treatment for decompression sickness is expensive. A typical stay in a recompression chamber will easily cost several thousand dollars, even before emergency transportation is included.

In the United Kingdom, treatment of DCS is provided by the National Health Service. This may occur either at a specialised facility or at a hyperbaric centre based within a general hospital.

==Other animals==
Animals may also contract DCS, especially those caught in nets and rapidly brought to the surface. It has been documented in loggerhead turtles and likely in prehistoric marine animals as well. Modern reptiles are susceptible to DCS, and there is some evidence that marine mammals such as cetaceans and seals may also be affected. AW Carlsen has suggested that the presence of a right-left shunt in the reptilian heart may account for the predisposition in the same way as a patent foramen ovale does in humans.

<text>7th Heaven (also known as Seventh Heaven) is a 1927 American synchronized sound romantic drama directed by Frank Borzage, and starring Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects using the Movietone sound system. The film is based upon the 1922 play &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, by Austin Strong and was adapted for the screen by Benjamin Glazer. &quot;7th Heaven&quot; was initially released as a standard silent film in May 1927. On September 10, 1927, Fox Film Corporation re-released the film with a synchronized Movietone soundtrack with a musical score and sound effects.

Upon its release, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; was a critical and commercial success and helped to establish Fox Film Corporation as a major studio. It was among the first three films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture (then called &quot;Outstanding Picture&quot;) at the 1st Academy Awards held on May 16, 1929. Janet Gaynor won the first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film (she also won for her performances in 1927&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and 1928&#x27;s &quot;Street Angel&quot;). Director Frank Borzage also won the first Academy Award for Best Director while screenwriter Benjamin Glazer won the first Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay).

In 1995, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film entered the public domain in the United States in 2023.

==Plot==

In the early 1910s, Chico works in the sewers of Paris. He expresses his desire to be a street sweeper to work above ground and light candles at a nearby church. After a meeting with the church&#x27;s priest, Chico gets the recommendation he needs for the street sweeping job.

Diane and her sister Nana live together, facing financial difficulties since their parents left them a few years ago. When news arrives that their parents have returned with a fortune, Diane and Nana anticipate a return to comfortable living. However, their father discovers their involvement in prostitution to make ends meet and refuses to accept them back, disowning them instead. Nana, furious at Diane for revealing the news, begins to beat her. As Diane tries to escape, Chico steps in, intervening in the confrontation and rescuing her.

After a brief flirtation, Nana returns with the police intending to arrest Diane. Once again, Chico intervenes, asserting that Diane is not a prostitute but his wife. Despite initial skepticism, the police refrain from arresting Diane due to lack of evidence. Concerned about potential repercussions for lying, Chico fears losing his job as a streetsweeper. To provide an alibi, he suggests Diane move in with him. After ensuring she&#x27;s not being exploited, Diane agrees to Chico&#x27;s proposal.

Soon afterwards, the police visit Chico&#x27;s apartment for further investigation, and their strategy succeeds, absolving them both of suspicion. With no more reason to stay, Diane prepares to leave, feeling disheartened after having grown fond of Chico and his apartment. When Chico offers her to stay, she joyfully accepts, feeling that Chico is a godsend. As they spend more time together, they quickly fall in love, and decide to marry genuinely.

News of World War I reaching France arrives, prompting the couple to hold an unofficial wedding in their apartment, with God as their sole witness. Chico is swiftly recruited, forcing him to depart for the battlefield. Upon his departure, a resentful Nana returns, deriding Diane for her marriage and attempting to assault her once more. However, Diane instead triumphs over Nana, expelling her from the apartment, and cites Chico’s support for her newfound bravery.

As Chico fights in the war, Diane finds work at a munitions factory. During a battle, Chico is gravely wounded and believes he&#x27;s dying. Diane is told by a soldier that Chico has been officially declared dead, leaving her devastated. When the war ends, Chico returns home, his death having been wrongly recorded, but he is now blind.

==Cast==
==Music==
The film featured a theme song entitled &quot;Diane&quot; which was composed by Ernö Rapée and Lew Pollack.

==Production notes==

The Broadway play upon which the film is based starred George Gaul and Helen Menken and ran at the Booth Theatre for 704 performances.

When the play was adapted for the screen, Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell were cast in the lead roles. The pairing proved to be so popular, the two went on to star in 11 more films together and were dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Lovebirds&quot;.

&quot;7th Heaven&quot; features the song &quot;Diane&quot; by Ernö Rapée and Lew Pollack, who wrote the song specifically for the film. The song is included on the re-released version of the film.

==Reception==
&quot;7th Heaven&quot; initially premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles replacing another Fox melodrama &quot;What Price Glory?&quot;, which had been playing since November 1926. A second opening was held at the Sam H. Harris Theatre in New York City on May 25. Both openings earned a total of $14,500. A series of Movietone shorts featuring Ben Bernie and his Orchestra, Gertrude Lawrence, Raquel Meller, and Charles &quot;Chic&quot; Sale preceded the film.

Upon its release, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; was a critical and commercial success. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic stated that the film &quot;grips your interest from the very beginning and even though the end is melodramatic you are glad that the sympathetic but self-satisfied Chico is brought back to his heart-broken Diane.&quot; The critic also praised Borzage&#x27;s direction, stating that the director &quot;has given it all that he could put through the medium of the camera.&quot; The film went on to play for 19 weeks in New York City and for 22 weeks in Los Angeles.

Due to the film&#x27;s success and the success of other Fox films featuring sound elements (&quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;What Price Glory?&quot;), the studio re-released &quot;7th Heaven&quot; with a synchronized Movietone soundtrack, including a musical score arranged by Ernö Rapée and sound effects. The re-release version premiered at New York City&#x27;s Roxy Theatre on September 10, 1927.

By 1932, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; had become the 13th-highest-grossing American silent, earning more than $2.5 million at the box office.

==Awards and honors==
==Remakes and adaptations==
A comparatively unknown 1937 remake of the film was produced as a sound feature starring Simone Simon, James Stewart, Jean Hersholt, and Gregory Ratoff, with Henry King directing. Unlike the 1927 version, the sound remake was not as financially successful.

&quot;7th Heaven&quot; was adapted for the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; four times: October 14, 1934, with Miriam Hopkins and John Boles (the show&#x27;s premiere episode); October 17, 1938, with Jean Arthur and Don Ameche; October 16, 1944, with Jennifer Jones and Van Johnson (on the show&#x27;s tenth-year anniversary); and finally on March 26, 1951, with Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, recreating their original roles.

A television adaptation was aired on October 26, 1953, on the anthology series &quot;Broadway Television Theatre&quot;. The episode stars Hurd Hatfield and Geraldine Brooks and was directed by Robert St. Aubrey.

On May 26, 1955, a stage musical version of the film opened at the ANTA Theatre starring Gloria DeHaven and Ricardo Montalbán. It closed on July 2, 1955, after 44 performances.

==Home media==
On December 9, 2008, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; was included in the &quot;Murnau, Borzage and Fox&quot; DVD box set released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

==In popular culture==
Chinese writer-director Yuan Muzhi&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;Street Angel&quot; has been cited as being influenced by elements of &quot;7th Heaven&quot; and another Frank Borzage film &quot;Street Angel&quot; (1928).

The theatrical poster for &quot;7th Heaven&quot; is displayed on the wall of the student Watanabe&#x27;s lodgings in the oldest surviving film by the Japanese director Yasujirō Ozu, &quot;Days of Youth: A Student Romance&quot; (&quot;Gakusei Romansu: Wakaki Hi&quot;, 1929).

Filmmaker Damien Chazelle has said the ending of his 2016 musical &quot;La La Land&quot; was inspired by the ending of &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

<text>East Lynne, or, The Earl&#x27;s Daughter is an 1861 English sensation novel by Ellen Wood, writing as Mrs. Henry Wood. A Victorian-era bestseller, it is remembered chiefly for its elaborate and implausible plot centering on infidelity and double identities. There have been numerous stage and film adaptations.

The much-quoted line &quot;Gone! And never called me mother!&quot; (variant: &quot;Dead! Dead! And never called me mother!&quot;) does not appear in the book; both variants come from later stage adaptations.

The book was originally serialised in &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; between January 1860 and September 1861, and it was issued as a three-volume novel on 19 September 1861.

== Plot summary ==

Lady Isabel Vane, a beautiful and refined young woman, is distraught when her beloved father dies suddenly. The earldom and all property are bequeathed to a distant relation, leaving Isabel homeless and penniless. With no other options, she marries hard-working lawyer Archibald Carlyle, who buys her former home, called East Lynne.

Carlyle&#x27;s elder sister Cornelia comes to live at East Lynne. She hates the marriage and, by taking over the household, makes Isabel&#x27;s life miserable. Carlyle, a kind man, had previously been friendly with a local lady, Barbara Hare, who had hoped to marry him. Suspicious of the relationship, Isabel leaves her husband and their infant children to elope with aristocratic but poor Captain Francis Levison. However, once abroad with Levison, Isabel realises he has no intention of marrying her even though she has borne their illegitimate child. He deserts her.

Isabel&#x27;s cousin, Lord Mount Severn, visits her in Europe and offers to support her. She learns from him that her husband was not unfaithful. On her way back to England, there is a train accident, and Isabel&#x27;s baby is killed and Isabel, badly injured, is reported dead. Isabel, in disguise and under a new name, takes the position of governess in the household of her former husband and his new wife (Barbara Hare), allowing her to be close to her children.

This situation becomes a source of great misery, however, as the little boy William dies of tuberculosis. Carlyle stands for Parliament, as does Sir Francis Levison, Isabel&#x27;s seducer. It transpires that under the name Thorn, Levison had been guilty of the murder of a Mr. Hallijohn. But Richard Hare, the brother of Barbara, had been falsely accused of that murder and goes on the run.

When the facts eventually come to light, there is a dramatic trial involving Hallijohn&#x27;s daughter Afy as a reluctant witness. 

The pressure of maintaining a façade (wearing blue glasses, adopting a foreign accent) to disguise her identity and being constantly reminded that her husband has moved on physically weakens Isabel. On her deathbed, she tells all to Carlyle, who forgives her.

==Adaptations==

There have been multiple adaptations for stage, radio, films and television. 

&quot;East Lynne&quot; has been adapted for the stage many times; the play was so popular that stock companies performed the play whenever they needed guaranteed revenue. It became so common that theatres stuck with a badly received play would assuage audiences with the hopeful promise, &quot;Next week, &quot;East Lynne&quot;!&quot;, which eventually became a catchphrase in comedies and cartoons, often as a sign outside a theatre. The play was staged so often that critic Sally Mitchell estimates that some version was seen by audiences in either England or North America every week for more than 40 years.

The &quot;Next week, &quot;East Lynne&quot;!&quot; catchphrase is mentioned in the 1936 film &quot;Libeled Lady&quot; in a scene with Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy.

=== Stage adaptations ===
The novel was first staged as &quot;Edith, or The Earl&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in New York in 1861 and under its own name on 26 January 1863 in Brooklyn; by March of that year, &quot;three competing versions were drawing crowds to New York theaters.&quot; The most successful version was written by Clifton W. Tayleur for actress Lucille Western, who was paid $350 a night for her performance as Isabel Vane. Western starred in &quot;East Lynne&quot; for the next 10 years. At least nine adaptations were made in all, not including plays such as &quot;The Marriage Bells&quot; that &quot;used a different title for the sake of some copyright protection.&quot; The work was revived on Broadway in 1926 in a production directed by James Light.

=== Film adaptions ===
* &quot;East Lynne&quot; (1913)
* &quot;East Lynne&quot; (1916), starring Theda Bara
* &quot;East Lynne&quot; (1922), an Australian film directed by Charles Hardy
* &quot;East Lynne&quot; (1925), starred Alma Rubens, Edmund Lowe, Lou Tellegen and Leslie Fenton
* &quot;Ex-Flame&quot; (1930), starred Neil Hamilton and according to Leslie Halliwell in &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; was a modernised version and provided unintentional comedy. Halliwell quoted &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s contemporary review of the film as &quot;mush stuff for the women.&quot;
* &quot;East Lynne&quot; (1931) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1931. The film was adapted from the novel by Tom Barry and Bradley King and directed by Frank Lloyd. The film is a melodrama starring Ann Harding, Clive Brook, Conrad Nagel and Cecilia Loftus. Only one copy of the film is known to exist. The screenplay was in turn novelised by Arline de Haas.
* &quot;Thai Ullam&quot; (1952) is a Tamil language adaptation of &quot;East Lynne&quot;.

=== Television ===
In the 1970s, a TV dramatisation was broadcast from the City Varieties Theatre in Leeds, with the audience all in Victorian costume and Queen Victoria in the royal box. The famous TV host of &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, Leonard Sachs, introduced the proceedings. 

The story was filmed in 1982, in a BBC made-for-television production starring amongst Martin Shaw, Gemma Craven, Lisa Eichhorn, Jane Asher, Annette Crosbie and Tim Woodward.

=== Radio ===
A radio serial was produced in Australia in 1939 with Queenie Ashton (as Lady Isabel) and Ronald Morse (as Francis Levison).

A radio adaptation in seven parts was made for BBC Radio 4 by Michael Bakewell, with Rosemary Leach narrating as Mrs. Wood, first broadcast in 1987.

=== Other adaptations ===
As the more melodramatic aspects of the story became dated, several parodies were performed, including &quot;East Lynne in Bugville&quot; with Pearl White (1914), Mack Sennet&#x27;s &quot;East Lynne with Variations&quot; (1917) and in 1931 the comedy &quot;East Lynne on the Western Front&quot;, in which British soldiers in World War I stage a burlesque version of the story.

==Critical assessment==
Some argue that the novel champions middle classes over the lower orders; others, however, find this claim &quot;too simplistic&quot; and argue that the novel &quot;highlights the shortfalls inherent to bourgeois masculinity.&quot; Sally Mitchell argues that the novel simultaneously upholds and undermines middle-class values. 

Other critics include the late 19th century English novelist George Gissing, who read the book whilst staying in Rome in March 1898 and wrote in his diary that it was &quot;not at all a bad book, of its sort.&quot; Perhaps the most practical assessment came from one who produced the play many times, actor and theater manager Tod Slaughter: &quot;No other play in its time has ever been more maligned, more burlesqued, more ridiculed, or consistently made more money.&quot;

==Legacy==
The town of East Lynne, Missouri took its name from the novel.

<text>The Front Page is a Broadway comedy about newspaper reporters on the police beat. Written by former Chicago reporters Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, it was first produced in 1928 and has been adapted for the cinema several times. The play entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.

==Plot==

The play&#x27;s single set is the dingy press room of Chicago&#x27;s Criminal Courts Building, overlooking the gallows behind the Cook County Jail. Reporters from most of the city&#x27;s newspapers are passing the time with poker and pungent wisecracks about the news of the day. Soon they will witness the hanging of Earl Williams, a white man and supposed Communist revolutionary convicted of killing a black policeman. Hildy Johnson, cocky star reporter for the &quot;Examiner&quot;, is late. He appears only to say goodbye; he is quitting to get a respectable job and be married. Suddenly the reporters hear that Earl Williams has escaped from the jail. All but Hildy stampede out for more information. As Hildy tries to decide how to react, Williams comes in through the window. He tells Hildy he is no revolutionary, and that he shot the police officer by accident. The reporter realizes this bewildered, harmless little man was railroaded — just to help the crooked mayor and sheriff pick up enough black votes to win re-election. It is the story of a lifetime. Hildy helps Williams hide inside a roll-top desk. His daunting challenge now is to get Williams out of the building to a safe place for an interview before rival reporters or trigger-happy policemen discover him. Hildy has no choice but to ask for help from Walter Burns, managing editor of the &quot;Examiner&quot; — a devious tyrant who would do just about anything to keep Hildy with the newspaper.

==Cast and characters==
Notable casts
&quot;The Front Page&quot; was produced by Jed Harris and directed by George S. Kaufman, with settings by Raymond Sovey. It opened at the Times Square Theatre, New York City, on August 14, 1928, and ran 278 performances before closing in April 1929.

==Significance==
The authors&#x27; expert plotting and rapid-fire, streetwise dialogue delighted audiences and made their play an instant classic. Hecht and MacArthur strongly influenced many other American comic writers, especially in Hollywood. In the 1970s, film producer Dore Schary told film historian David Bordwell that &quot;The Front Page&quot; influenced studio writers and directors in the 1930s. The play popularized the image of American journalists as fast-talking, wisecracking &quot;hard-boiled&quot; types, excessively fond of alcohol and hard living in general, who would go to any lengths to get a story on the front page of their newspapers. 

The newspapers are modeled on the City News Bureau of Chicago (where MacArthur had worked), &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; (where Hecht was a reporter), and William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Chicago&#x27;s American&quot;. The character Earl Williams is loosely based on &quot;Terrible&quot; Tommy O&#x27;Connor. The character of Williams also was at least partially based on the case of Thomas Mooney, a radical leftist sentenced to death on the basis of questionable evidence. Walter Burns is a thinly disguised caricature of Hearst editor Walter Howey. The corrupt Mayor of Chicago seems to have been based on William Hale Thompson, who, like the mayor in the play, depended in part upon black voters to stay in office. Commenting on the play&#x27;s seeming veracity, &quot;New York Times&quot; theater critic Brooks Atkinson wrote, &quot;The authors and directors have packed an evening with loud, rapid, coarse and unfailing entertainment. No one who has ground his heels in the grime of a police headquarters press room will complain that this argot misrepresents the gentlemen of the press.&quot;

==Revivals==
The play was restaged four more times on Broadway. The 1969–70 revival was the most successful of these. It was produced at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and starred Robert Ryan and Bert Convy as Burns and Johnson, running for a total of 222 performances. The 1946 revival was directed by Charles MacArthur and ran for 79 performances. The 1986–87 revival was produced at the Vivian Beaumont at Lincoln Center, directed by Jerry Zaks and starred Richard Thomas as Hildy and John Lithgow as Burns. This production ran for 57 performances.

A Broadway revival opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, in a limited engagement, starting on September 20, 2016, in previews and officially on October 20. Directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien, the cast starred Nathan Lane as Walter Burns, John Slattery as Hildy Johnson, John Goodman as Sheriff Hartman, Jefferson Mays as Bensinger, Holland Taylor as Mrs. Grant, Sherie Rene Scott as Mollie Malloy, Robert Morse as Silas Pinkus, and Christopher McDonald as Murphy. The production received generally good notices, especially for Lane, and became the first show of the season to recoup and turn a profit. It received two Tony nominations: Best Featured Actor in a Play (Lane) and Best Scenic Design of a Play (Douglas W. Schmidt).

John Guare&#x27;s theatrical adaptation of the film &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; was produced at The La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, California, in 2013, directed by Christopher Ashley.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Front Page&quot; has been adapted for film and radio a number of times:
* &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931), directed by Lewis Milestone, starring Adolphe Menjou and Pat O&#x27;Brien.
* The 1931 film was presented as a one-hour radio adaption on June 28, 1937, by &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, starring Walter Winchell and James Gleason.
* &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), directed by Howard Hawks, starring Cary Grant as Walter and Rosalind Russell as Hildy, who in this version is a woman and Walter&#x27;s ex-wife. A romantic element is added to the plot, as Walter is trying to win Hildy back both professionally and personally.
* In 1940 Lux Radio Theatre adapted &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; as a radio program starring Claudette Colbert (who turned down the film role) as Hildy and Fred MacMurray as Walter Burns. It was first broadcast on September 30th, 1940.
* The 1931 film was adapted for radio on June 22, 1946, by &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot;, with Menjou and O&#x27;Brien reprising their roles from the film.
* A 1948 radio series titled &quot;The Front Page&quot; and based loosely on the play ran on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network. It starred Dick Powell and William Conrad.
* &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1949), CBS Television series, starring John Daly and Mark Roberts.
* &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1974), directed by Billy Wilder, starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.
* &quot;Switching Channels&quot; (1988), starring Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner, with the newspaper reporters updated to television reporters and none of the original dialogue retained.

&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; and &quot;Switching Channels&quot; changed the male lead Hildebrand &quot;Hildy&quot; Johnson to women, Hildegaard &quot;Hildy&quot; Johnson and Christy Colleran respectively. John Varley&#x27;s 1991 science fiction novel &quot;Steel Beach&quot; takes the story — and the change of sex — to another level; the plot includes a sex-change by a male reporter named Hildy Johnson.

There have also been four television productions, all under the title &quot;The Front Page&quot;:
* 1945, in the US;
* 1948, in the UK;
* 1949–1950 (see above) in the US as a series on CBS;
* 1970, in the US

The musical &quot;Windy City&quot; (book and lyrics by Dick Vosburgh, music by Tony Macaulay) was also based on &quot;The Front Page&quot;. It premiered at the Victoria Palace Theatre, London, England on July 20, 1982 and ran for 250 performances.

Additionally, Hecht and MacArthur&#x27;s story for the 1939 film &quot;Gunga Din&quot; recycles their basic plot of trying to dissuade someone from leaving his job, in this case Douglas Fairbanks Jr.&#x27;s character attempting to resign his post in the British army and comrades Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen conniving to prevent it. 

Film critic Leonard Maltin describes the 1940 film &quot;Torrid Zone&quot; as a 3.5-out-of-4-star “variation on Front Page”. Set among the highly competitive banana plantations of Central America, it stars James Cagney as the invaluable employee, Pat O&#x27;Brien as the amoral boss who will stop at nothing to keep him from leaving, George Tobias as a revolutionary awaiting the firing squad, and Ann Sheridan as love interest, with snappy dialogue provided by Richard Macaulay and Jerry Wald.

The 2013 graphic novel, &quot;Nemo: Heart of Ice&quot;, by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill, has a prose afterword purportedly written by Hildy Johnson, who visits Lincoln Island to write about the wedding of Captain Nemo&#x27;s granddaughter to the son of Robur the Conqueror.

<text>Skippy is a 1931 American pre-Code comedy film based on the popular comic strip and novel &quot;Skippy&quot; by Percy Crosby. The screenplay was by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Don Marquis, Norman Z. McLeod, and Sam Mintz.

The film stars Jackie Cooper in the title role, Robert Coogan, Mitzi Green and Jackie Searl. Director Norman Taurog won the Academy Award for Best Director (at age 32, he remained the youngest winner in this category until Damien Chazelle won for the 2016 film &quot;La La Land&quot;). The film also did well enough to inspire a sequel called &quot;Sooky&quot; (1931). &quot;Skippy&quot; was released on April 5, 1931, by Paramount Pictures. 
For his performance, Cooper, at the age of nine, became the youngest person to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Plot==

Skippy (Jackie Cooper) is the feisty son of the strict Dr. Herbert Skinner (Willard Robertson) and his wife Ellen (Enid Bennett). Skinner forbids Skippy to play in the pauperized Shantytown, because of its filth and criminal surroundings. Regardless, Skippy and his friend Sidney (Jackie Searl) visit Shantytown, where Skippy meets a new boy named Sooky (Robert Coogan, Jackie Coogan&#x27;s little brother). He saves Sooky from the bully Harley Nubbins (Donald Haines), and Skippy and Sooky become friends.

One day, Harley accidentally breaks his father&#x27;s windshield with Skippy&#x27;s yo-yo. Harley, whose father is brutish and aggressive, blames the damage on Skippy and Sooky. Mr. Nubbins (Jack Rube Clifford), who works as a dogcatcher, takes Sooky&#x27;s dog and demands the two boys pay for the damages if they want their dog back. Skippy and Sooky gather three dollars by breaking Skippy&#x27;s savings bank, but Mr. Nubbins accepts it only for his windshield. He gives them three days to obtain another three dollars for a dog license, and he threatens to kill their dog if they don&#x27;t get him the money.

Sooky and Skippy spend the next two days selling bottles, lemonade and wood, and staging a performance to earn money, but Skippy&#x27;s father doesn&#x27;t want to lend them the remaining thirty cents. Mr. Nubbins kills the dog and Skippy blames his father. The next morning, Skippy gets a new bicycle from his father but trades it to his friend, Eloise (Mitzi Green), for her new dog. He then takes the dog to Sooky. Dr. Skinner has a change of heart and buys Sooky a licensed dog, finds his mother a job, and refrains from ordering Shantytown destroyed, instead offering assistance to its citizens. For the first time, Dr. Skinner plays with Skippy in Shantytown. There they accidentally break Mr. Nubbins&#x27; new windshield. Dr. Skinner wins a fight against Mr. Nubbins and shows he is a good father.

==Cast==
* Jackie Cooper as Skippy Skinner
* Robert Coogan as Sooky Wayne
* Mitzi Green as Eloise
* Jackie Searl as Sidney
* Willard Robertson as Dr. Herbert Skinner
* Enid Bennett as Mrs. Ellen Skinner
* Donald Haines as Harley Nubbins
* Jack Rube Clifford as Mr. Nubbins, Dog-Catcher
* Helen Jerome Eddy as Mrs. Wayne
* Guy Oliver as Dad Burkey

==Production==
In the scene where the dog dies, director Norman Taurog needed to get his nephew, Jackie Cooper, to cry, so he told young Jackie he was going to kill his own dog by dragging the dog off set (with the assistance of Cooper&#x27;s grandmother) and then having a security guard &quot;shoot&quot; the dog. Cooper did the scene, but despite finding the dog was not harmed, he was still hysterical for hours afterward to the point of needing a sedative.

==Reception==
&quot;Skippy&quot; received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86%, based on 7 reviews.

<doc id="61053" wikidata="Q1142707" url="?curid=61053" title="Trader Horn (1931 film)">
<text>Trader Horn is a 1931 American Pre-Code adventure film directed by W.S. Van Dyke and starring Harry Carey and Edwina Booth. It is the first non-documentary film shot on location in Africa. The film is based on the book of the same name by trader and adventurer Alfred Aloysius Horn and tells of adventures on safari in Africa.

The film&#x27;s dialogue was written by Cyril Hume. John Thomas Neville and Dale Van Every wrote the adaption. &quot;Trader Horn&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1931. Edwina Booth, the female lead, contracted a career-ending illness while filming in Africa, for which she later sued Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

==Plot==
The film depicts the adventures of real-life trader and adventurer Alfred Aloysius &quot;Trader&quot; Horn (Harry Carey), while on safari in Africa. Much of the film is fictional, including the discovery of a white blonde jungle queen, the lost daughter of a missionary (Edwina Booth). A scene based upon a genuine incident occurs in which Carey as Horn swings on a vine across a river filled with genuine crocodiles, one of which comes very close to taking his leg off.

==Cast (in credits order)==
* Harry Carey as Aloysius &#x27;Trader&#x27; Horn
* Edwina Booth as Nina Trent, The White Goddess
* Duncan Renaldo as Peru
* Mutia Omoolu as Rencharo, Horn&#x27;s native translator and majordomo
* Olive Golden as Edith Trent
* Bob Kortman (scenes deleted)
* Marjorie Rambeau as Edith Trent (scenes deleted)
* C. Aubrey Smith as St. Clair, a Trader (uncredited)
* Riano Tindama as Witch Doctor (uncredited)

==Production==
Many accidents and delays occurred during filming in Africa. Many of the crew, including the director W.S. Van Dyke, contracted malaria. An African crewman fell into a river and was eaten by a crocodile, while another was killed by a charging rhinoceros. The rhinoceros was captured on film and the scene was used in the final print. Swarms of many insects, including locusts and tse-tse flies, were common and cast and crew were perpetually bitten or stung.

Female lead Edwina Booth became infected, probably with malaria or schistosomiasis during filming. It took six years for her to fully recover from this and other conditions she endured. She retired from acting soon after and sued Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The case was settled out of court. A sound crew, sent halfway through filming, were unable to produce good quality work. This resulted in most of the dialogue sequences being reshot at the MGM studios in Culver City, California. This caused rumours that the entire production had been filmed there, so most of this footage was cut from the final release. Many animal scenes were filmed in Tecate, Mexico, by a second unit to avoid the American laws on the ethical treatment of animals. For example, lions were reportedly starved to promote vicious attacks on hyenas, monkeys and deer.

==Release==
The film earned $1,642,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada and $1,953,000 overseas for a total of $3,595,000. Subsequent reissues added a further $596,000 bringing its total worldwide rental to $4,191,000 and a profit to $1.3 million.

==Other adaptations==
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer remade the film, released in 1973. Although filmed on the MGM backlot, the 1973 remake used tinted stock footage from the 1931 film. A sexploitation parody film titled &quot;Trader Hornee&quot; was released in 1970. &quot;Trader Horn&quot; is the subject of a 2009 documentary, &quot;Trader Horn: The Journey Back&quot; featuring Harry Carey Jr.

<doc id="61056" wikidata="Q4825876" url="?curid=61056" title="Authentic Thaumaturgy">
<text>Authentic Thaumaturgy is a set of rules for portraying magic in role-playing games, written by Isaac Bonewits. The first edition was published by Chaosium in 1978. A substantially expanded edition was published by Steve Jackson Games in 1998. A third edition appeared in 2005. 

==Contents==
&quot;Authentic Thaumaturgy&quot; is a sourcebook of ideas for improving fantasy role-playing magic systems by basing them on purportedly real magical practices; the author has a Bachelor of Arts in Magic from the University of California.

The rules are based on the magic system Bonewits claimed to use in real life in his capacity as the Archdruid of Ár nDraíocht Féin. 

Bonewits presents 26 Laws of Magic which he explains &quot;are not legislative laws but, like those of physics or of musical harmony, are practical observations that have been accumulating over the course of thousands of years, with remarkable similarity in almost every known human culture. Those of you who prefer to remain skeptical as to the reality of psychic phenomena and the systems of magic developed to control them will at least find these Laws an interesting and detailed guide to what psychologists and anthropologists so patronizingly refer to as “magical thinking.”&quot; Bonewits then presents examples of how some of these laws work.

These 26 laws are (in order): The Law of Knowledge, Self-Knowledge, Cause &amp; Effect, Synchronicity, Association, Similarity, Contagion, Positive Attraction, Negative Attraction, Names, Words of Power, Personification, Invocation, Evocation, Identification, Infinite Data, Finite Senses, Personal Universes, Infinite Universes, Pragmatism, True Falsehoods, Synthesis, Polarity, Dynamic Balance, Perversity, and Unity.

<doc id="61057" wikidata="Q798692" url="?curid=61057" title="Bad Girl (1931 film)">
<text>Bad Girl is a 1931 American pre-Code drama film directed by Frank Borzage and starring Sally Eilers, James Dunn, and Minna Gombell. The screenplay was adapted by Edwin J. Burke from the 1928 novel by Viña Delmar and the 1930 play by Delmar and Brian Marlowe. The plot follows the courtship and marriage of two young, working-class people and the misunderstandings that result from their not having learned to trust and communicate with one another. The film propelled then-unknown actors Eilers and Dunn to stardom. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Plot==
Dorothy Haley and Edna Driggs are store models, first seen in bridal clothes at their job one afternoon. After work Dorothy fends off her boss, who wants to take her for a ride, by claiming to be married to a prizefighter. The girls then go to Coney Island. On the return steamboat trip, the women make a bet about attracting a certain man&#x27;s attention, and Dorothy proceeds to annoy him by playing a ukulele. This man is Eddie Collins; after his initial grouchy reaction to the women, he slowly forms a connection with Dorothy and sees her home. Eddie works in a radio shop and dreams of having a shop on his own, for which he has been saving.

Eddie forgets to show up for a date and Dorothy angrily finds him in his boarding house, where they remain together until 4 a.m. Eddie walks her home but she is afraid to go up, fearing the reaction of her abusive elder brother who is her guardian. Eddie proposes marriage as a solution and Dorothy joyfully accepts. Her brother calls her a tramp and evicts her from her home. Dorothy suffers some anxiety the next day when Eddie seems to have disappeared; he then turns up, having made arrangements for a new place to live, and the two are happily married.

Ten weeks later, Dorothy confides to Edna that she is pregnant, but is reluctant to tell Eddie the news when she learns that he is ready to open his new shop, an expensive commitment. Instead she tells Eddie that she would like to return to work, to which he objects. Wrongly guessing that she really wants a larger place to live, Eddie cancels his plans for the shop in favor of a lavish new apartment and the purchase of new furnishings, increasing Dorothy&#x27;s worries. By the time Eddie finally finds out he is to become a father, the two mutually misunderstand that the other is unhappy about the pregnancy, resulting in a strain on their marriage. The strain intensifies when Eddie stays out late at night to earn extra money as a boxer to pay for the services of Dr. Burgess, the best obstetrician in the city, all without telling Dorothy. Eddie is being pummeled in one of these prizefights while Dorothy leaves for the hospital; when he returns and Dorothy sees him bruised and bandaged, she assumes he was in a barroom brawl and turns her back on him. After their son is born, Dorothy plans to leave Eddie; however, before that can happen the misunderstanding is cleared up, and the couple returns home together to raise their child.

==Themes==
The Depression-era backdrop of poverty and deprivation tinges the characters&#x27; preoccupation with and fears about earning money and paying for their needs.

==Production==
===Development===
The development of &quot;Bad Girl&quot; from the novel and play into a film required extensive purging and rewriting of the material to conform to the dictates of the Hays Office. A November 16, 1928, memo from the Hays Office put a damper on the whole production, stating: &quot;&#x27;Bad Girl&#x27; might be produced as a sex hygiene picture called &#x27;Motherhood.&#x27; It is simply the story of girl who is &#x27;bad&#x27; for one night, marries the boy the next day, and then has a baby&quot;. The memo described the novel as a &quot;nauseating story of doctors, illnesses, etc.&quot; and as &quot;cheap and shoddy writing about cheap and shoddy people&quot;. Several studios besides Fox were interested in the rights to the novel and play, including Pathé, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Columbia Pictures, but were either scared off by the Hays Office&#x27;s warnings of extensive cuts by the censor or the difficulty of dramatizing the novel&#x27;s main subject of obstetrics. Between 1929 and 1930, the Hays Office advised numerous producers not to attempt an adaptation because it would be &quot;too censorable&quot;.

Fox, however, came up with a treatment that avoided the scandalous elements of the story and smoothed over the whole issue of premarital sex which Dorothy had with Eddie during their late night in his apartment. Instead, the implications of their night together are not addressed and Eddie&#x27;s proposal of marriage to save Dorothy from the shame of facing her brother at 4 a.m. comes off as spontaneous. All that remains of the provocative content of the novel is the title, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;. The script was approved by the Hays Office in May 1931 with only a small number of &quot;relatively minor&quot; changes.

Despite the vote of approval, Fox executives did not hold much stock in the film&#x27;s commercial appeal and even Borzage refused to direct it. But Fox pressured Borzage into accepting the assignment since his contract was about to expire and was not expected to be renewed. The studio further showed its lack of enthusiasm for the project by budgeting less than $100,000 for the production and hiring unknown actors. As a result, Borzage had a &quot;fairly free hand&quot; in the production.

===Casting===
Borzage wanted Spencer Tracy to play the lead role, but Fox would not agree to this. After seeing a screen test that New York stage actor James Dunn had done at Fox Film&#x27;s Astoria Studios in Queens, Borzage chose him for the role of Eddie and Dunn was signed to a Fox contract. Dunn made his screen debut in &quot;Bad Girl&quot;. Eilers had previously appeared in Buster Keaton films as an ingénue and was known for using &quot;the filthiest language in Hollywood&quot;, thus connecting her in some way to the title character.

===Filming===
Production took place between June 1 and July 4, 1931.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Roxy Theatre in New York City on August 14, 1931, and in Los Angeles on August 25. It had its official U.S. release on September 13, 1931. The film was not released in Europe.

Stage producer Robert V. Newman filed suit against Fox and the Roxy Theatre after the New York premiere, contending that he had sold Fox the rights to the play on the condition that the film not be released before September 1. The New York Supreme Court threw out the case, stating that &quot;no substantial damage&quot; had been done by the earlier premiere date.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Bad Girl&quot; was one of Fox&#x27;s most successful releases of 1931, earning $1.1 million at the box office.

===Critical reception===
The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; praised the film as a modern take on contemporary life, describing it as &quot;so human, so free from pretense and so provocatively real&quot;. According to Borzage biographer Hervé Dumont, the film surprised contemporary critics as it was &quot;stripped of all conventional ingredients—love triangles, jealousy, sex appeal or crimes—but buoyed by the cheerful exuberance that apparently effortlessly metamorphoses a mixture of little nothings into a gem of subtlety and charm&quot;. Dumont notes that Borzage deftly circumvented anything that could be considered provocative and instead brought out the humor and sentimentality of the relationship between the main characters. Reid calls the result both realistic and romantic. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review credits Borzage as &quot;the dominant force&quot; behind the film, but also commends screenwriter Edwin J. Burke&#x27;s dialogue &quot;as amazingly skillful in satisfying the demand for wisecracks while retaining the quality of naturalness and always keeping in character&quot;.

James Dunn&#x27;s performance was singled out by many reviews as the pivot around which the film revolves. The &quot;Baltimore Evening Sun&quot; wrote: &quot;Without Dunn, &quot;Bad Girl&quot; would be just another movie. With him, it&#x27;s something that provokes chuckles, tears, laughs, sighs and everything else that a nice little movie hopes to provoke&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Dunn&#x27;s first starring turn &quot;triumphant&quot;, asserting that &quot;no performance has lately equaled the impression made by this rather plain young man, who, aside from having a likable personality, scores a major hit by his ability as an actor&quot;. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; said of Dunn: &quot;Sincere, honest and natural, his performance is flawless&quot;. Rebutting a review that claimed any actor would have succeeded in the &quot;sure-fire part&quot;, a &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reviewer argued:
It was a role so skillfully conceived and executed, so sympathetically played and so warm and sincere that one&#x27;s natural inclination is to put the actor in this case above the role rather than the role above the actor. ... Mr. Dunn, on the other hand, created a character. It had a definite form. It breathed life. It had depth and feeling. Not for a moment were you conscious of James Dunn. You were conscious only of Eddie Collins.

The &quot;Brattleboro Reformer&quot; wrote: &quot;James Dunn, as the sensitive, nervous, conscientious young husband in this, his first, picture gives a performance of astonishing strength. … He presents a new kind of film star and a personality of infectious charm&quot;. The scene in which Dunn as Eddie pleads with Dr. Burgess to take his wife&#x27;s case was cited by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;the equal of any of the great moments in past pictures&quot;, and by the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; as &quot;probably the most notable work of the season&quot;.

Critics also praised the female performers. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Sally Eilers&#x27; role &quot;easily her best performance and it, too, is perfect&quot;. The &quot;Bratteboro Reformer&quot; commended Eilers&#x27; ability to convey a range of moods and emotions while also projecting personal charm. Minna Gombell was cited for adding &quot;warmth and sympathy&quot; to her characterization of the wisecracking friend.

===Accolades===
&quot;Bad Girl&quot; was nominated in three categories at the 5th Academy Awards, winning in two:
&quot;Bad Girl&quot; was named one of the ten best films of the year by &quot;Film Daily&quot;, and one of the &quot;Ten Best Pictures of 1931&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The film spawned several adaptations. In October 1931, Fox produced a Spanish-language adaptation for the South American market titled &quot;Marido y Mujer&quot; (&quot;Husband and Wife&quot;), directed by Bert Sebell and released in 1932. &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, also starring James Dunn and directed by John G. Blystone, was released in 1935. 20th Century Fox remade the story in 1940 as &quot;Manhattan Heartbeat&quot;, starring Robert Sterling and Virginia Gilmore.

==Re-teaming Dunn and Eilers==
Following the film&#x27;s success, Fox immediately teamed Dunn and Eilers in more films together. They starred in &quot;Over the Hill&quot; (1931), &quot;Dance Team&quot; (1932), &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1933), and &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; (1933). The 1933 film &quot;Jimmy and Sally&quot; was also written and titled with the duo in mind, but after Eilers declined to play the lead, her part was given to Claire Trevor.

<doc id="61058" wikidata="Q463733" url="?curid=61058" title="The Champ (1931 film)">
<text>The Champ is a 1931 American pre-Code film starring Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper and directed by King Vidor from a screenplay by Frances Marion, Leonard Praskins and Wanda Tuchock. The picture tells the story of a washed-up alcoholic boxer (Beery) attempting to put his life back together for the sake of his young son (Cooper).

Beery won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance (sharing the prize with Fredric March for &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;), Frances Marion won the Academy Award for Best Story, and the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor&#x27;s career.

==Plot==
Andy &quot;Champ&quot; Purcell (Wallace Beery) is the former world heavyweight champion, now down on his luck and living in squalid conditions with his eight-year-old son &quot;Dink&quot; in Tijuana, Mexico. Champ attempts to convince promoters to set up a fight for him, but his efforts are stymied by his alcoholism. Dink is repeatedly disappointed by his father&#x27;s irresponsible actions and frequent broken promises, but his devotion to his father never wavers.

Champ is also a compulsive gambler, another vice which he repeatedly promises he will surrender. After a winning streak, he fulfills a previous promise to buy Dink a horse, whom they name &quot;Little Champ&quot; and decide to race. At the track, Dink happens across a woman who, unknown to either of them, is his mother Linda. She is remarried to Tony, a wealthy man.

Linda and Tony observe Dink and Champ together and realize that Dink is her son. Champ allows Linda to see Dink, who accepts that she is his mother. But he feels no emotion toward her, as she has never been part of his life. Linda resolves to remove Dink from the miserable atmosphere in which he&#x27;s growing up and have him live with her family.

Catching Champ during an all-night gambling binge, Tony asks him to turn Dink over so that Tony and Linda can put him into school. Champ refuses. The night of gambling ends with Champ having lost Little Champ, which devastates Dink. Champ asks Linda for money to buy the horse back, and she gives it to him. But he starts gambling again and loses the money Linda loaned him. He also winds up in jail, breaking Dink&#x27;s heart once more.

Ashamed, Champ finally agrees to send an unwilling Dink to live with Tony and Linda. On the train ride home, Tony and Linda try their best to welcome Dink into their family. He does not dislike them, but he is consumed only by thoughts of his father. He runs away back to Tijuana, where he finds that Champ has a fight scheduled with the Mexican heavyweight champion. When he sees Dink, Champ returns to good spirits, trains hard, and, for the first time, really does stay away from drinking and gambling. Champ is determined to win the fight, make Dink proud of him, and use his prize money to buy back Little Champ.

Tony and Linda attend the fight, bringing best wishes and assurances that they will make no further efforts to separate Dink from Champ. The match is brutal, and Champ is seriously injured. Dink and the others in his corner urge him to throw in the towel, but Champ refuses. He musters a last burst of energy and knocks out his opponent. After the fight, he triumphantly presents Little Champ to Dink. But after witnessing his son&#x27;s overjoyed reaction, Champ collapses.

He is brought into his dressing room, where a doctor determines that his injuries are mortal. Champ urges Dink to cheer up and then dies. Despite the best efforts of others to calm him, Dink continually wails, &quot;I want the Champ!&quot; Finally, he spots Linda enter the room. Dink looks at her, cries out, &quot;Mother!&quot; and runs into her arms. She picks him up and he sobs, &quot;The Champ is dead, Mama.&quot; She turns and carries him out of the room as he buries his face in her shoulder, crying.

==Production==
Screenwriter Frances Marion wrote the title role specifically for Wallace Beery, whose formerly flourishing career, which had almost abruptly ended with the advent of sound, had been revitalized in 1930 with an Academy Award nomination for &quot;The Big House&quot; and the huge success of &quot;Min and Bill&quot; with Marie Dressler. Director King Vidor eagerly took on the film since it emphasized the traditional family values and strong belief in hope—qualities he felt were essential to a good motion picture. Wallace Beery claimed to have turned down a $500,000 offer from a syndicate of Indian studios to play Buddha in order to take the role in &quot;The Champ.&quot; Cooper was paid $1,500 a week while working on the film. A special outdoor set, rather than location shooting, was built to accommodate the Tijuana horse racing track scenes. Shooting began in mid-August 1931 and ended eight weeks later, at which time Jackie Cooper&#x27;s contract with Paramount Pictures was transferred to MGM.

&quot;The Champ&quot; debuted on November 9, 1931, at the Astor Theatre in New York City. Beery flew his own plane from Los Angeles, California cross-country to attend the premiere. After the film&#x27;s debut, Beery declared Cooper was a &quot;great kid&quot; but that he would not work with the child actor again, a promise he broke within the year for the remake of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;The Bowery&quot;.

==Assessment==

The film, along with Beery&#x27;s role in &quot;Min and Bill&quot;, catapulted Beery&#x27;s career. Beery signed a contract with MGM shortly thereafter specifying that he receive a dollar more per year than any other actor on the lot, effectively making him the world&#x27;s highest-paid actor. The picture also made nine-year-old Jackie Cooper the first child star of the 1930s, an era noted for its numerous, popular child actors.

At the time the movie was released, critics criticized the film&#x27;s lack of originality. For example, &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared that &quot;something more novel and subtle&quot; was needed, although it also praised Beery&#x27;s acting. &quot;Variety,&quot; too, very much liked Beery in the film, noting that he delivered a &quot;studied, adult&quot; performance. &quot;Time&quot; called the film repetitive, blasted Cooper for sniveling, and accused director King Vidor of laying &quot;on pathos with a steam-shovel.&quot; Nonetheless, &quot;Time&quot; praised the movie, declaring it &quot;Utterly false and thoroughly convincing...&quot; Many critics cited the &quot;special chemistry&quot; between Beery and Cooper, which led the two actors to be paired again numerous times. Cooper and Beery had no such chemistry off-screen. Cooper accused Beery of upstaging and other attempts to undermine his performances, out of what Cooper presumed was jealousy. Critics today still highly praise &quot;The Champ&quot;.

&quot;The Champ&quot; has been described as an inverted women&#x27;s film, because men in the film are not generally depicted at the top of the socio-economic ladder, but are shown as a primary childcare provider. The famous final scene, in which the camera is thrust into Jackie Cooper&#x27;s weeping face, has been compared to similar aggressive and intrusive camera work in classic motion pictures such as &quot;Liebelei&quot; (Max Ophüls, dir.; 1933), &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; (D.W. Griffith, dir.; 1919) and the films of Roberto Rossellini.

&quot;The Champ&quot; has had significant cultural effect. A number of motion pictures in the 1930s, some of them also starring Wallace Beery, repeated the basic story about a man surrendering to drink and redeemed by the love of his long-suffering son. Film critic Judith Crist has argued that almost any film pairing an adult actor alongside a child actor must be compared to &quot;The Champ&quot; in terms of the chemistry between the actors and the effectiveness of the film. The film had an immediate effect on world cinema as well. &quot;The Champ&quot; is considered one source film which inspired Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s classic Japanese film &quot;Passing Fancy&quot; (&quot;Dekigokoro&quot;, 1933). The film was, in part, the inspiration for the father and son in the Berenstain Bears books.

==Reception==
&quot;The Champ&quot; was a big hit upon its release. According to MGM records, the film earned $917,000 domestically and $683,000 foreign. The film itself also received overwhelmingly positive reviews; as of now, it holds a 96% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Irene Thirer of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; described the film as “so profuse and so enjoyable as the film combines the amazing talents of Jackie Cooper with the superb histrionics of Wallace Beery”.

==Awards and nominations==
==Remakes==
The movie was remade in 1952 as &quot;The Clown,&quot; starring Red Skelton as a washed-up clown rather than a washed-up boxer. It was remade again in 1979 by Franco Zeffirelli (see &quot;The Champ&quot;).

<doc id="61059" wikidata="Q906283" url="?curid=61059" title="Five Star Final">
<text>Five Star Final is a 1931 American pre-Code drama film about the excesses of tabloid journalism directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon (in her screen debut) and Boris Karloff. The screenplay was by Robert Lord and Byron Morgan based on the 1930 play of the same name by Louis Weitzenkorn. The title refers to the practice of newspapers publishing a series of editions throughout the day, with their final-edition front page having five stars printed and the word &quot;Final.&quot; &quot;Five Star Final&quot; is also a font introduced during World War I and then favored by newspapers for its narrow type.

Warner Bros. remade the film in 1936 as &quot;Two Against the World&quot;, also known as &quot;One Fatal Hour&quot;, starring Humphrey Bogart in Robinson&#x27;s part and set in a radio station instead of at a newspaper.

The film was nominated at the 5th Academy Awards (1931/1932) for Best Picture, but lost to &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;.

Newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst was greatly offended by the film, which he interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on him and his operation. He retaliated by publishing negative reviews in his papers and pressuring theaters not to show the film.

==Plot==
Joseph W. Randall is the managing editor of the &quot;New York Evening Gazette&quot; tabloid newspaper who has been trying to legitimize the paper by reducing sensationalism and improving the reporting, but circulation has dropped dramatically. When owner Bernard Hinchecliffe plans to boost sales with a retrospective series on a 20-year-old murder, hoping to revive the scandal, Randall reluctantly agrees. He had covered the original story about stenographer Nancy Voorhees, who shot her boss after he reneged on his promise to marry her. Her pregnancy won the jury&#x27;s sympathy, and she was acquitted.

Unaware of impending doom, Nancy is now married to Michael Townsend, an upstanding member of society, and her daughter Jenny, who believes that Townsend is her father, is about to marry the son of a socially prominent family, Philip Weeks.

Randall throws himself into the assignment. To dig up dirt about Nancy, he assigns unscrupulous reporter &quot;Reverend&quot; T. Vernon Isopod, who masquerades as a minister and wins the confidence of the bride&#x27;s parents on the eve of the wedding. They have read the headlines promising a series on the murder. Nancy is horrified at the renewed interest in the scandal, and the family members confess their concerns to Isopod, whom they mistake for a church representative, and give him a photo of Jenny. Michael realizes the horrible mistake just as Isopod leaves, and he phones the church.

Randall&#x27;s secretary Miss Taylor is so disgusted that she gets drunk at a local speakeasy and then tells Randall what she thinks of the whole affair. Isopod comes in late, drunk and brimming with information. Randall swings into action, mocking up a photo layout.

Randall sends reporters Ziggie and Carmody to cover the Townsend apartment. The Townsends, hoping to prevent the revelation of the full story and save the marriage, make separate appeals for help. Mr. Townsend visits the church rector, who promises support, and Nancy phones Randall, begging him to drop the story, but he refuses, telling her that it is too late. Nancy kills herself by taking poison, and Michael comes home and discovers her body in the bathroom. When Jenny and Philip visit soon after, Michael does not inform them of the suicide and pretends to have a phone conversation with Nancy. After sending Jenny and Philip away, he enters the bathroom and also commits suicide. Carmody and Ziggie climb into the apartment from the fire escape. When they open the bathroom door, they take a photograph and call the information into Randall, who wants the story for the five-star final.

The next day, Phillip&#x27;s parents tell Jenny that the wedding will be called off, but Phillip arrives and defies them. Randall gets drunk and feels like a murderer. He tells the night desk to drop the story.

Hinchecliff is leery of the bad publicity that may result from the inquest, but his underlings are thrilled at the upsurge in numbers and want to offer Jenny $1,200 for the rights to tell her mother&#x27;s story. Randall opposes the idea. Jenny visits the paper and demands that the men tell her why they killed her mother. A guilt-ridden and disgusted Randall tells her that they were killed for the purpose of circulation. Jenny points a gun at Randall but Philip appears just in time to prevent her from pulling the trigger. Phillip then angrily delivers a chilling speech that ends: &quot;You&#x27;ve grown rich on filth and no one&#x27;s ever dared rise up and crush you out.&quot; He threatens to hunt them down and kill them if his wife&#x27;s name is ever mentioned in the paper again.

Randall denounces Hinchecliffe and resigns. He runs out and Miss Taylor follows him.

A copy of the &quot;New York&quot; &quot;Evening Gazette&quot; trumpeting the news that the suicide victims have been buried is shown swept away in the rain.

==Production==
The film was based on a play written by Louis Weitzenkorn after his stint as editor of Bernarr Macfadden&#x27;s &quot;New York Evening Graphic&quot;, a sensationalist tabloid of the 1920s. The play ran for 175 performances on Broadway in 1930 and 1931.

Producer Hal B. Wallis wanted the press room set to appear authentic, and sent Warner Bros. staff members to study the design of two actual newspaper offices. The film was in production from April 14 through May 11, 1931.

The film was made in the same year as was &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, Robinson&#x27;s breakthrough film. Cast member Boris Karloff also broke through with his iconic portrayal of the monster in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; later that same year.

==Box office==
According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $665,000 domestically and $157,000 foreign.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Five Star Final&quot; was nominated for an Outstanding Production Academy Award in 1931/1932 at the 5th Annual Academy Awards and was named by &quot;Film Daily&quot; as one of the ten best films of 1931.

<doc id="61060" wikidata="Q1306660" url="?curid=61060" title="One Hour with You">
<text>One Hour with You is a 1932 American pre-Code musical comedy film about a married couple who are attracted to other people. It was produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch &quot;with the assistance of&quot; George Cukor, and written by Samson Raphaelson from the play &quot;Only a Dream&quot; by Lothar Schmidt. It stars Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald, Genevieve Tobin, Charlie Ruggles and Roland Young.

The film is a musical remake of &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot; (1924), the second film that Lubitsch directed in the United States. &quot;One Hour with You&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

The film was preserved by the UCLA Film and Television Archive with its original color tints restored.

==Plot==
Parisian doctor Andre Bertier is faithful to his loving wife Colette, much to the surprise of his lovely female patients. But when Colette&#x27;s best friend Mitzi Olivier insists upon being treated by Dr. Bertier, his devotion is put to the test.

==Cast==
* Maurice Chevalier as Dr. Andre Bertier
* Jeanette MacDonald as Colette Bertier
* Genevieve Tobin as Mitzi Olivier

* Barbara Leonard as Mitzi&#x27;s Maid
* George Barbier as Police Commissioner
* Donald Novis as Crooner
* Charles Coleman as Marcel (uncredited)

==Soundtrack==
Unless otherwise noted, the music is written by Oscar Straus and the lyrics are written by Leo Robin.

* &quot;One Hour with You&quot;, music by Richard A. Whiting, performed by the Coconut Orchestra with vocal by Donald Novis, also sung by Genevieve Tobin and Maurice Chevalier, Charlie Ruggles and Jeanette MacDonald, and Chevalier and MacDonald
* &quot;Police Station Number&quot; (uncredited), music by John Leipold

* &quot;Oh That Mitzi&quot;, sung by Chevalier
* &quot;Three Times a Day&quot;, sung by Tobin
* &quot;What a Little Thing Like a Wedding Ring Can Do&quot;, sung by Chevalier and MacDonald
* &quot;It Was Only a Dream Kiss&quot;, sung by Chevalier and MacDonald

==Production==
Lubitsch was originally scheduled to direct &quot;One Hour with You&quot; and supervised the project in preproduction, but was unable to direct because his previous film, &quot;The Man I Killed,&quot; went beyond schedule. George Cukor was instead assigned to direct. Within two weeks after filming had begun, conflicts between Chevalier and Cukor brought Lubitsch back, although Cukor remained on the set. Cukor and Lubitsch each demanded sole credit for directing and the matter was litigated in court. Before a judgment was rendered, Cukor received a credit for assisting the direction and the right to break his contract with Paramount in order to direct &quot;What Price Hollywood?&quot; at RKO.

A French-language version titled &quot;Une heure près de toi&quot; was produced simultaneously, with Lili Damita playing Tobin&#x27;s role.

<text>Shanghai Express is a 1932 American pre-Code film about a group of train passengers held hostage by a warlord during the Chinese Civil War. It was directed by Josef von Sternberg and stars Marlene Dietrich, Clive Brook, Anna May Wong and Warner Oland. The screenplay was written by Jules Furthman based on a 1931 short story by Harry Hervey. &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; was the fourth of seven films that Sternberg and Dietrich created together.

The film was released during the midst of the Great Depression. It was remade as &quot;Night Plane from Chungking&quot; (1943) and &quot;Peking Express&quot; (1951).

==Plot==

In 1931, China is embroiled in a civil war. Friends of British captain Donald &quot;Doc&quot; Harvey envy him because Shanghai Lily is traveling on the express train he is taking from Peiping to Shanghai. They tell him she is a &quot;coaster&quot;, a &quot;woman who lives by her wits along the China coast&quot; (i.e., a prostitute). Lily is in fact his former lover Madeline. Five years earlier, she had played a trick on him to gauge his love for her, but it backfired and he left her. She informs him, &quot;It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily.&quot; Lily still loves him, and she notices that he still wears a watch with her photograph in it.

Among the other passengers in first class are fellow coaster Hui Fei, Christian missionary Mr. Carmichael (who calls the coasters &quot;fallen women&quot;), gambler Sam Salt, opium dealer Eric Baum, boarding-house keeper Mrs. Haggerty, French officer Major Lenard, and a mysterious Eurasian, Henry Chang.

At a scheduled stop, Chinese government soldiers empty the train to check passports and apprehend a high-ranking rebel agent. Chang sends a message at the telegraph office. Later, the train is stopped and commandeered by the rebel army and its powerful warlord, who turns out to be Chang. He tortures Baum for insulting him on the train. He starts questioning the other first-class passengers, looking for someone important enough to keep as a hostage in exchange for his aide. Harvey, traveling to perform brain surgery on the governor-general of Shanghai, becomes the hostage.

Waiting for his aide to arrive, Chang offers to take Lily to his palace. She declines, claiming she has reformed. Harvey breaks in and knocks Chang down. Because he needs Harvey alive, Chang does not retaliate at that point. He has Hui Fei brought to his quarters, where he rapes her. Lily is taken back to the train and stays up praying for Harvey.

When Chang&#x27;s man arrives, Chang tells Lily he plans to blind Harvey in revenge. She tells Chang she will go to his palace with him. Harvey is released unharmed, unaware he was to be blinded at the hands of Chang.

Hui Fei sneaks back into Chang&#x27;s quarters and stabs him to death as he is packing to leave. She tells Harvey to rescue Lily, which he does. Carmichael, realizing he was wrong to condemn Lily, coaxes Lily to reveal the truth about how she had saved Harvey. She insists that he not tell Harvey and he agrees, telling Harvey that he knows Lily is a good person.

The train reaches Shanghai, and the passengers disperse. Harvey finds Lily while she is buying him a new watch, and asks her to forgive him for his lack of faith. They kiss amidst the bustle of the train station.

==Cast==
* Marlene Dietrich as Shanghai Lily / Madeline 
* Clive Brook as Captain Donald &quot;Doc&quot; Harvey
* Anna May Wong as Hui Fei
* Warner Oland as Henry Chang
* Lawrence Grant as Reverend Carmichael
* Eugene Pallette as Sam Salt
* Gustav von Seyffertitz as Eric Baum
* Louise Closser Hale as Mrs. Haggerty
* Émile Chautard as Major Lenard

==Production==

&quot;Shanghai Express&quot; is based on Henry Hervey&#x27;s story &quot;Sky Over China&quot; (also known as &quot;China Pass&quot;), which was loosely based on the Lincheng Incident that occurred on May 6, 1923, in which a Shandong warlord captured the Shanghai-to-Beijing express train and took 25 Westerners, including Lucy Aldrich, and 300 Chinese people hostage. All of the hostages were successfully ransomed.

The story also echoes elements of Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s short story &quot;Boule de Suif&quot; in that it consists of travelers stopped in a country at war and a woman is forced into intimate relations with the commander in charge. However, the denouement differs; in Maupassant&#x27;s story, the woman does not murder the commander.

Paramount studio heads were concerned that the Hays Office kept a close watch on the film for its portrayal of Reverend Carmichael and the depiction of the Chinese revolution.

Although set in China, few Chinese actors appear in the film. However, Anna May Wong, who was American-born Chinese, has a major role, and many Chinese extras are used in the film.

&quot;Shanghai Express&quot; film was in production from August to November 1931 and was released the following year.

==Reception==

The film was praised by Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a star vehicle for Marlene Dietrich: &quot;Miss Dietrich gives an impressive performance. She is languorous but fearless as Lily.&quot; He also singled out other characters: &quot;Clive Brooks&#x27;s performance is also noteworthy...Warner Oland is excellent as Mr. Chang and Anna May Wong makes the most of the role of the brave Chinese girl. Eugene Pallette serves splendidly as Sam Salt.&quot;

Jonathan Spence, writing about the film&#x27;s usefulness as a piece of history, feels that the real 1923 Lincheng Incident was far more dramatic, but says that &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; is nonetheless &quot;a wonderful film, with great performances by Dietrich ... and Anna May Wong.&quot;

The critic for &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot; called &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; a &quot;riotous exercise in excess in every area; the visuals are overpowering and sumptuous; the costumes ornate and extravagant; the sets a riot of fabrics, light and space; and all of it captured in the most delectable black-and-white cinematography that one can find anywhere.&quot; He discusses the film&#x27;s interest in the questions of race and colonialism and notes the &quot;peculiar bifurcation&quot; of the film&#x27;s view of race, as most of the respectable &quot;white&quot; characters in the film are seen as both flawed and racist. He says only the characters played Dietrich, Wong, and Brook have &quot;real moral agency.&quot; He calls the film &quot;surprisingly feminist,&quot; with Dietrich being a &quot;strong, dominating presence&quot; and Wong&#x27;s character her equal.

&quot;Shanghai Express&quot; is memorable for its stylistic black-and-white chiaroscuro cinematography. Even though Lee Garmes was awarded the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, according to Dietrich, it was von Sternberg who was responsible for most of it.

The film was a box office success grossing $827,000 in rentals the US and Canada and $1.5 million altogether in worldwide rentals. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 96% from 67 reviews.

<text>The Smiling Lieutenant is a 1931 American pre-Code musical comedy film directed by Ernst Lubitsch, starring Maurice Chevalier, Claudette Colbert and Miriam Hopkins, and released by Paramount Pictures.

It was written by Samson Raphaelson and Ernest Vajda from the operetta &quot;Ein Walzertraum&quot; by Oscar Straus, with libretto by and , which in turn was based on the novel &quot;Nux, der Prinzgemahl&quot; (&quot;Nux the Prince Consort&quot;) by Hans Müller-Einigen. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. This was the first of three films directed by Lubitsch and starring Miriam Hopkins. The other two were &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; and &quot;Design for Living&quot;.

==Plot==
In Vienna, Lieutenant Nikolaus &quot;Niki&quot; von Preyn (Maurice Chevalier) meets Franzi (Claudette Colbert), the leader of an all-female-orchestra. They soon fall in love. While standing in formation at a parade honouring the visiting royal family of Flausenthurm, Niki winks at Franzi in the crowd. Unfortunately the gesture is intercepted by Anna, the Princess of Flausenthurm (Miriam Hopkins). The naive princess takes offence; to assuage her, the lieutenant insists that he winked and smiled at her because of her beauty. This backfires; charmed and besotted, Anna demands that she marry the lieutenant, and threatens to marry an American if this plan is thwarted. Franzi leaves Niki upon seeing him return in a royal carriage. After intervention by the Emperor of Austria, an international incident is narrowly averted by the marriage of the lieutenant and the princess, though the marriage is not consummated as Niki will only chastely kiss his bride—and his father-in-law.

Homesick and lovesick, Niki wanders the streets, and encounters Franzi, who has continued to perform with her orchestra in Flausenthurm since the wedding, unable to move on. The two resume their romance.

Anna finds out and confronts Franzi. During the confrontation, Franzi realizes that the princess is in fact deeply in love with the lieutenant. She decides to save the marriage by giving the dowdy princess a makeover, and they sing the duet &quot;Jazz up your lingerie!&quot; before Franzi departs for good.

The results are a complete success as the lieutenant returns home, follows his satin-clad, cigarette-puffing wife into the bedroom and closes the door – opening it briefly to give the audience a last song and suggestive wink.

==Cast==
* Maurice Chevalier as Lieutenant Nikolaus &quot;Niki&quot; von Preyn
* Claudette Colbert as Franzi
* Miriam Hopkins as Princess Anna
* Charles Ruggles as Max
* George Barbier as King Adolf XV
* Hugh O&#x27;Connell as Niki&#x27;s Orderly
* Granville Bates as Bug Collector (uncredited)
* Cornelius MacSunday as Emperor Franz Josef (uncredited)

==Production==
The film was not made under pleasant circumstances: the shift to the Astoria, New York, studios accounts for the sense of confinement on set. Chevalier described performing – &quot;smiles and cute winks of the eye&quot; – a &quot;mechanical display of technique&quot; due to grief over his mother&#x27;s death. Lubitsch also played referee between Colbert and Hopkins, who were determined to be shot from the same angle. Lubitsch encouraged their dispute that suited their characters on screen.

Scenes from the film were included in the 1931 promotional film by Paramount, &quot;The House That Shadows Built&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot; was Paramount&#x27;s biggest grosser of 1931. Barrios claims that &quot;Lubitsch and Chevalier were invincible&quot;. It was also named the year&#x27;s &quot;Best Ten&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, along with Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;City Lights&quot; and F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Tabu&quot;.

Lubitsch was still in the stages of mastering sound-on-film technology and combining it with narrative: James Harvey acclaims that &quot;technically &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot; is the most accomplished of Lubitsch&#x27;s early sound films. In sets, camerawork, background music, alternations of sound and silence, thus the film reaches a certain level that makes &quot;The Love Parade&quot; and &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; look comparatively stilted&quot;. For Andrew Sarris, &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot; stands between the &quot;lilting lyricism&quot; of &quot;Love Parade&quot; and the &quot;tempered ironies&quot; in &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;.

Due to an ongoing copyright dispute with the silent-film version, &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot; remained out of circulation for years and was considered as a lost film until a print was discovered in Denmark in the 1990s. When the film resurfaced, the &quot;general elation&quot; was followed by &quot;an inevitable let down&quot; due to technical problems.

==&quot;The Lubitsch Touch&quot;==
The notion of &quot;The Lubitsch Touch&quot; is used to describe the visual comment or joke that becomes a trademark or signature of Lubitsch&#x27;s films. Billy Wilder defines the touch in relation to &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot;: &quot;It was the elegant use of the Superjoke. You had a joke, and you felt satisfied, and then there was one more big joke on top of it. The joke you didn&#x27;t expect. That was the Lubitsch touch.&quot; The ultimate Superjoke is that at the end of the film, &quot;the wrong girl gets the man&quot;.

<text>The New Partnership for Africa&#x27;s Development (NEPAD) is an economic development program of the African Union (AU). NEPAD was adopted by the AU at the 37th session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government in July 2001 in Lusaka, Zambia. NEPAD aims to provide an overarching vision and policy framework for accelerating economic co-operation and integration among African countries.

==Origins and function==
NEPAD is a merger of two plans for the economic regeneration of Africa: the Millennium Partnership for the African Recovery Programme (MAP), led by Former President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa in conjunction with Former President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria; and the OMEGA Plan for Africa developed by President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal. At a summit in Sirte, Libya, March 2001, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) agreed that the MAP and OMEGA Plans should be merged.

The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) developed a &quot;Compact for Africa’s Recovery&quot; based on both these plans and on resolutions on Africa adopted by the United Nations Millennium Summit in September 2000, and submitted a merged document to the Conference of African Ministers of Finance and Ministers of Development and Planning in Algiers, May 2001.

In July 2001, the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, adopted this document under the name of the New African Initiative (NAI). The leaders of G8 countries endorsed the plan on July 20, 2001; and other international development partners, including the European Union, China, and Japan also made public statements indicating their support for the program. The Heads of State and Government Implementation Committee (HSGIC) for the project finalized the policy framework and named it the New Partnership for Africa&#x27;s Development on 23 October 2001. NEPAD is now a program of the African Union (AU) that has replaced the OAU in 2002, though it has its own secretariat based in South Africa to coordinate and implement its programmes.

NEPAD&#x27;s four primary objectives are: to eradicate poverty, promote sustainable growth and development, integrate Africa in the world economy, and accelerate the empowerment of women. It is based on underlying principles of a commitment to good governance, democracy, human rights and conflict resolution; and the recognition that maintenance of these standards is fundamental to the creation of an environment conducive to investment and long-term economic growth. NEPAD seeks to attract increased investment, capital flows and funding, providing an African-owned framework for development as the foundation for partnership at regional and international levels.

In July 2002, the Durban AU summit supplemented NEPAD with a Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance. According to the Declaration, states participating in NEPAD ‘believe in just, honest, transparent, accountable and participatory government and probity in public life’. Accordingly, they ‘undertake to work with renewed determination to enforce’, among other things, the rule of law; the equality of all citizens before the law; individual and collective freedoms; the right to participate in free, credible and democratic political processes; and adherence to the separation of powers, including protection for the independence of the judiciary and the effectiveness of parliaments.

The Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance also committed participating states to establish an African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) to promote adherence to and fulfilment of its commitments. The Durban summit adopted a document setting out the stages of peer review and the principles by which the APRM should operate; further core documents were adopted at a meeting in Abuja in March 2003, including a Memorandum of Understanding to be signed by governments wishing to undertake the peer review.

===Current status===

Successive AU summits and meetings of the HSGIC have proposed the greater integration of NEPAD into the AU&#x27;s structures and processes. In March 2007 there was a &quot;brainstorming session&quot; on NEPAD held in Algeria at which the future of NEPAD and its relationship with the AU was discussed by an ad hoc committee of heads of state. The committee again recommended the fuller integration of NEPAD with the AU. In April 2008, a review summit of five heads of state—Presidents Mbeki of South Africa, Wade of Senegal, Bouteflika of Algeria, Mubarak of Egypt and Yar&#x27;Adua of Nigeria—met in Senegal with a mandate to consider the progress in implementing NEPAD and report to the next AU summit to be held in Egypt in July 2008.

==Structure==

The HSGIC to which the NEPAD secretariat reports comprises three states for each region of the African Union, with former President Obasanjo (Nigeria) as elected chair, and Presidents Bouteflika (Algeria) and Wade (Senegal) as deputy chairmen. The HSGIC meets several times a year and reports to the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government.

There is also a Steering Committee, comprising 20 AU member states, to oversee the development of policies, programs and projects -this committee reports to the HSGIC.

The NEPAD Secretariat, now the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency, is based in Midrand, South Africa. The NEPAD Secretariat is not responsible for the implementation of development programs itself, but works with the African Regional Economic Communities— the building blocks of the African Union. The role of the NEPAD Secretariat is one of coordination and resource mobilisation.

Many individual African states have also established national NEPAD structures responsible for liaison with the continental initiatives on economic reform and development programs.

=== Chief Executive Officers ===
===Partners===
* United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)
* African Development Bank
* Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA)
* Investment Climate Facility (ICF)
* African Capacity Building Foundation
* Office of the UN Under-Secretary-General and Special Adviser on Africa
* IDC (The Industrial Development Corporation) - Sponsor of NEPAD

==Programs==
The eight priority areas of NEPAD are: political, economic and corporate governance; agriculture; infrastructure; education; health; science and technology; market access and tourism; and environment.

During the first few years of its existence, the main task of the NEPAD Secretariat and key supporters was the popularisation of NEPAD&#x27;s key principles, as well as the development of action plans for each of the sectoral priorities. NEPAD also worked to develop partnerships with international development finance institutions—including the World Bank, G8, European Commission, UNECA and others—and with the private sector.

After this initial phase, more concrete programs were developed, including:
* The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), aimed at assisting the launching of a &#x27;green revolution&#x27; in Africa, based on a belief in the key role of agriculture in development. To monitor its progress, the Regional Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System was created.
* The Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), which comprises numerous trans-boundary infrastructure projects in the four sectors transport, energy, water and ICT, aimed at boosting intra-African trade and interconnecting the continent.
* The NEPAD Science and Technology programme, including an emphasis on research in areas such as water science and energy.
* The &quot;e-schools programme&quot;, adopted by the HSGIC in 2003 as an initiative to equip all 600,000 primary and secondary schools in Africa with IT equipment and internet access within 10 years, in partnership with several large IT companies. See NEPAD E-School program
* The launch of a Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF) by the Public Investment Corporation of South Africa, to finance high priority cross-border infrastructure projects.
* Capacity building for continental institutions, working with the African Capacity Building Foundation, the Southern Africa Trust, UNECA, the African Development Bank, and other development partners. One of NEPAD&#x27;s priorities has been to strengthen the capacity of and linkages among the Regional Economic Communities.
* NEPAD was involved with the Timbuktu Manuscripts Project although it is not entirely clear to what extent.

==Criticism==
NEPAD was initially met with a great deal of scepticism from much of civil society in Africa as playing into the &#x27;Washington Consensus&#x27; model of economic development. In July 2002, members of some 40 African social movements, trade unions, youth and women&#x27;s organizations, NGOs, religious organizations and others endorsed the African Civil Society Declaration on NEPAD rejecting NEPAD; a similar hostile view was taken by African scholars and activist intellectuals in the 2002 Accra Declaration on Africa&#x27;s Development Challenges.

Part of the problem in this rejection was that the process by which NEPAD was adopted was insufficiently participatory—civil society was almost totally excluded from the discussions by which it came to be adopted.

More recently, NEPAD has also been criticised by some of its initial backers, including notably Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, who accused NEPAD of wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and achieving nothing. Like many other intergovernmental bodies, NEPAD suffers from slow decision-making, and a relatively poorly resourced and often cumbersome implementing framework. The great lack of information about the day-to-day activities of the NEPAD secretariat—the website is notably uninformative—does not help its case.

However, the program has also received some acceptance from those who were initially very critical, and, in general, has seen its status become less controversial as it becomes more established and its programs become more concrete. The aim of promoting greater regional integration and trade among African states is welcomed by many, even as the fundamental macroeconomic principles NEPAD endorses remain contested.

<doc id="61066" wikidata="Q1479213" url="?curid=61066" title="Skippy the Bush Kangaroo">
<text>Skippy the Bush Kangaroo (known commonly as Skippy) is an Australian television series created by Australian actor John McCallum, Lionel (Bob) Austin, and Lee Robinson, produced from 1967 to 1969 (airing from 5 February 1968 to 4 May 1970) about the adventures of a young boy and his highly intelligent pet kangaroo, and the various visitors to the fictional Waratah National Park, filmed in today&#x27;s Waratah Park and adjoining portions of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park near Sydney.

Three series comprising 91 30-minute episodes were produced. Additionally, a full-length film titled &quot;Skippy and the Intruders&quot; was released to theatres in 1969.

==Plot and setting==
Skippy, the show&#x27;s namesake star, is a female eastern grey kangaroo, that is befriended by 9-year-old Sonny Hammond, who with 16-year-old brother Mark are the children of widower Matt Hammond, the head ranger of Waratah National Park. The stories revolved around events in the park, including its animals, the dangers arising from natural hazards, and the actions of visitors (featuring numerous stars, predominately of the period in guesting roles). The boys&#x27; mother is said (in episode 48 &quot;The Mine&quot;) to have died shortly after Sonny was born.

The small and unusually intelligent Skippy was not a pet, and the series often mentioned that Skippy lived in the park and was free to come and go as she pleased. Skippy was found in the bush as a baby by Sonny—an orphan, her mother having been killed by shooters. That once Skippy was old enough to look after herself, she was always understood to be able to go back to the bush, but a strong bond had been built up between Skippy and Sonny and the rest of the Hammond family. Skippy was a remarkable kangaroo. Capable of near-human thought and reasoning, she could understand everyone, open doors, carry things in her pouch, cross streams on narrow logs, foil villains, rescue hapless bushwalkers, untie ropes, collect the mail, and even operate the radio. In one episode, she plays drums in a band; in another, she places a bet - and wins - on a horse at Randwick Racecourse.

Sharing the ranger headquarters residence was the helicopter pilot, Flight Ranger Jerry King, aged in his mid-20s. Later, several female characters were introduced to the series, including Dr. Anna Steiner, a research scientist working in the park, and schoolgirl Clancy Merrick, the teenaged daughter of another park ranger who boards with the Hammonds. Members of the Aboriginal Theatre from Yirrkala in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory made guest appearances in three episodes.

The series was often characterised as an Australian or kangaroo version of &quot;Flipper&quot; or &quot;Lassie&quot;.

==Cast==
* Ed Devereaux as Matt Hammond, head ranger of Waratah National Park
* Garry Pankhurst as Sonny Hammond, Matt&#x27;s younger son
* Ken James as Mark Hammond, Matt&#x27;s elder son
* Tony Bonner as Jerry King (episodes 1-78), flight ranger (helicopter pilot)
* Liza Goddard as Clarissa &quot;Clancy&quot; Merrick (episodes 9-75) was the teenaged daughter of a ranger stationed at another section of the park. When her father is transferred to a park in northern New South Wales, Matt invites Clancy to stay with the Hammond family so that her music studies are not disrupted by the move north. She leaves the series when her character is awarded a musical scholarship to study in London.
* John Warwick as Sir Adrian Gillespie, head of NSW National Parks Board
* Elke Neidhardt as Anna Steiner, a German doctor and playing a support role only in season one
* Morgan Brain as Sgt. Bernard Gillies
* Skippy was played by at least nine different kangaroos

== Episodes ==
Three series were made with a total of 91 episodes, and production was wound up in September 1969. Producers never intended to make more, partly because 91 episodes were considered enough, and partly because the child actor who played Sonny, Garry Pankhurst, was growing up.

==Production==
The Skippy TV series was produced by Fauna Productions. During 1963, British film director Michael Powell had visited Australia to preproduce his film, &quot;They&#x27;re A Weird Mob&quot;. There, he met actor and theatre businessman John McCallum and legal expert Bob Austin, who used their local knowledge to find financing from Australian backers. The film did well, and McCallum and Austin together with veteran Australian producer Lee Robinson went on to set up Fauna Productions. The business made its reputation with Skippy, produced in association with Frank Packer&#x27;s TCN Channel 9 Sydney. Fauna Productions went on to produce the TV series &quot;Barrier Reef&quot; and &quot;Boney&quot;, as well as the feature film &quot;Nickel Queen&quot;. Fauna Productions is still in business, now being run by two sons of the founders, Philip Austin and Nick McCallum. It holds copyright over the original Skippy TV series, while the Nine Network holds the trademark.

Most episodes were directed by Max Varnel or Eric Fullilove, with scripts written by Australian writers. Producer Lee Robinson said, &quot;Each story has the underlying thought, which is the preservation of wildlife&quot;.

Accomplished musician, band-leader, and composer Eric Jupp was responsible for the theme and incidental music for Skippy. &quot;It took me a few days to write the Skippy theme,&quot; said Jupp. &#x27;I&#x27;d already written three or four versions and then rejected them. But the effort has proved worthwhile because about 30,000 records of the theme have been sold in Australia alone.&#x27;.

===Location filming===
The series was shot in northern Sydney, on then undeveloped Crown land west of Namba Road now known as Waratah Park. Permission to film and build structures on the site was given by Warringah Council. Also necessary was the cooperation of the newly created NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, under government minister Tom Lewis, and the Ku-ring-gai Chase Trust to allow access to a further within the adjacent Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. Following preparatory work, filming commenced in May 1967.

The ranger headquarters and residence was purpose-built for the series and used for both exterior and interior scenes. Power and water supply had to be connected and roads constructed, together with a helipad and helicopter-servicing area. Other national parks were also used for filming, as well as the streets and beaches of Sydney and surrounding districts. &quot;The Australian bush provided an excellent scenic backdrop, which was much appreciated by local and overseas viewers alike.&quot;

===Animal actors===
Between 9 and 15 kangaroos were used for each show. The apparent manual dexterity was often achieved by using separate arms in the hands of human operators. Skippy&#x27;s trademark &quot;tchk tchk tchk&quot; noise was entirely fictional. Kangaroos make no such sounds, but some sort of sound was needed for the series, and someone came up with the idea of clicking tongues to make the sound. To this day, many people believe that kangaroos make &quot;tchk tchk&quot; noises. To make Skippy move her mouth, supposedly creating the vocalisations, production staff gave the kangaroos chocolate, chewing gum, or grass, and in some cases, an elastic band around the lower jaw.

A menagerie of other animals and birds was used for the show, including dingoes, possums, emus, galahs, and koalas, all trained and managed by Scotty Denholm, a former NSW police-dog trainer. In theory, there was only one Skippy, but in reality, many stand-ins were used. &quot;Like people, some kangaroos are brighter than others,&quot; said producer Dennis Hill. Nonetheless, limits exist as to what one can get a kangaroo to do. Often, the actors could be noticed patting the kangaroo to get her to move, or holding her to prevent her moving. Kangaroo-paw bottle openers, of a type that could be purchased at any souvenir shop, were used for close-up scenes of Skippy opening doors or picking up objects. Also, a stuffed kangaroo from a taxidermist was used for scenes from behind, or when Skippy was required to jump into a confined space such as the helicopter.

==Feature film==
Filming of the Skippy movie commenced in October 1968. Entitled &quot;The Intruders&quot; or &quot;Skippy and the Intruders&quot;, the movie was largely filmed on the Waratah Park set, as well as near the south coast town of Mallacoota. &quot;Basically a feature-length episode, the movie was seen as a good, rollicking adventure yarn and was well-received by Skippy fans.&quot;

==Popularity and awards==
Skippy was the first Australian series to be heavily merchandised. The Skippy Club boasted over 67,000 members. In Japan, short 8mm colour films were on sale. In Australia and many overseas countries, one could buy Skippy pyjamas, ice-creams, toys, jewellery, soap, comics, jelly-beans, rulers, pencils, puzzles, toothpaste, shampoo, T-shirts, towels, and soft drinks. The Commercial Banking Company had Skippy moneyboxes, the contents of which could be banked with the details entered into a Skippy passbook. There were LP and EP records, an adventure story narrated by John McCallum, and several books, and in 2009, one could still buy Skippy Corn Flakes. The popularity of Skippy was summed up by Fauna&#x27;s marketing and merchandising manager, Kevin Gleeson: &#x27;Skippy is clean, non-violent fun with no sex. It&#x27;s wholesome, family-type entertainment. . . most importantly, any necessary violence is innocuous and insignificant, with the old Skippy coming to the rescue at the end of each episode.&#x27;.

Skippy won a number of awards: 
*A 1968 Logie Special Award for Best Export Production and a Logie for Michael Wright, writer of episode four, &quot;The Poachers&quot;
*A 1968 Penguin for Best Live Show
*A 1969 Charlie Award for Best Promotion and Contribution to the Australian entertainment industry. 

All three series of Skippy plus &quot;The Intruders&quot; have been released on DVD. The series sold around the world, reportedly shown in 128 countries. It is still being shown in some countries, some 51 years after it was made. Lee Robinson says the series only recovered its costs in 1976.

==Broadcast history==
===Domestic===
The show was produced for global distribution and filmed in colour. It premiered outside of Australia. The domestic premiere in Sydney (on TCN-9) and Melbourne (GTV-9) was Monday evening, 5 February 1968.

The Nine Network readily repeated the series several times after Australian television switched to colour transmission in 1975. In 2009, the Nine Network began to rerun the series in a graveyard slot in the early hours of the morning. In 2013, 9Gem started showing &quot;Skippy&quot; at 6:30 am.

=== International ===
The Australian series was one of the most popular exported television programs. &quot;Skippy&quot; was broadcast in all Commonwealth countries, including in Canada, where it was adapted in Quebec for the Standard French market as .

Making its debut in the UK on 8 October 1967 on ATV (four months before it was released in its native Australia), &quot;Skippy&quot; rivalled &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot; in terms of popularity in Britain’s &quot;TV Comic&quot;.

&quot;Skippy&quot; was broadcast in Mexico, where it was dubbed into Spanish and known as , and has been seen in most Spanish-speaking countries, including Cuba and Spain, where it became very popular. In Latín America, the show was broadcast on free TV in the 1970s, and on pay TV (cable, satellite and IPTV) vía Sundance Channel (Channel 520 of DIRECTV).

In the Netherlands, &quot;Skippy&quot; was first broadcast between 1969 and 1972. In Germany, it was known as , while in Italy, it was known as and broadcast by RAI Television. The show was popular in Scandinavia, and in Norway, a chain of shopping centres were named in honour of the programme. The series crossed the Iron Curtain and was broadcast in Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s. The series was also widely distributed in Ghana, where it aired weekly on the GBC. The series was also broadcast in Iran. &quot;Skippy&quot; was syndicated in the United States during the late 1960s; it was frequently scheduled on weekends, with other children&#x27;s programmes.

==&quot;The Adventures of Skippy&quot;==
The series was revived in 1992 as the short-lived &quot;The Adventures of Skippy&quot;. This revival series focused on the now-adult Sonny Hammond (played by Andrew Clarke) – having followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by becoming a ranger at a wildlife park – who now had his own family and a pet kangaroo named Skippy.

In the U.S., this version also aired on Animal Planet in 1997, and also on TBN&#x27;s Smile of a Child children&#x27;s network until 2019.

A series of 39 episodes has been released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment.

==Later history==
In 1998, an animated spin-off series was produced, known as &quot;&quot;. It featured a version of Skippy, portrayed as a male, anthropomorphic kangaroo, working as a park ranger.

In 1999, Skippy starred in advertisements for the chocolate confectionery Rolo Cookies.

In September 2008, actor Tony Bonner sued the production company seeking residuals from merchandising and DVD sales from the series.

On 17 September 2009, a documentary &quot;Skippy: Australia&#x27;s First Superstar&quot; was broadcast on the ABC in Australia and the BBC in the UK. The documentary was produced by Western Australian-based documentary production company Electric Pictures.

==In popular culture==
The original series was parodied in a recurring sketch as part of the British comedy series &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot; under the title &quot;Skipinder, the Punjabi Kangaroo&quot;: the parody redubbed scenes from the original &quot;Skippy&quot;. The show was also parodied in the 1989–1992 Australian sketch comedy TV show, &quot;Fast Forward&quot;.

<doc id="61067" wikidata="Q554269" url="?curid=61067" title="Joel Chandler Harris">
<text>Joel Chandler Harris (December 9, 1848 – July 3, 1908) was an American journalist and folklorist best known for his collection of Uncle Remus stories. Born in Eatonton, Georgia, where he served as an apprentice on a plantation during his teenage years, Harris spent most of his adult life in Atlanta working as an associate editor at &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;.

Harris led two professional lives: as the editor and journalist known as Joe Harris, he supported a vision of the New South with the editor Henry W. Grady (1880–1889), which stressed regional and racial reconciliation after the Reconstruction era; as Joel Chandler Harris, fiction writer and folklorist, he wrote many &#x27;Brer Rabbit&#x27; stories from the African-American oral tradition.

==Life==
=== Education: 1848–1862 ===
Joel Chandler Harris was born in Eatonton, Georgia, in 1848 to Mary Ann Harris, an Irish immigrant. His father, whose identity remains unknown, abandoned Mary Ann shortly after Harris&#x27; birth. The parents had never married; the boy was named Joel after his mother&#x27;s attending physician, Dr. Joel Branham. Chandler was the name of his mother&#x27;s uncle. Harris remained self-conscious of his illegitimate birth throughout his life.

A prominent physician, Dr. Andrew Reid, gave the Harris family a small cottage to use behind his mansion. Mary Harris worked as a seamstress and helped neighbors with their gardening to support herself and her son. She was an avid reader and instilled in her son a love of language: &quot;My desire to write—to give expression to my thoughts—grew out of hearing my mother read &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;.&quot;

Dr. Reid also paid for Harris&#x27; school tuition for several years. In 1856, Joe Harris briefly attended Kate Davidson&#x27;s School for Boys and Girls, but transferred to Eatonton School for Boys later that year. He had an undistinguished academic record and a habit of truancy. Harris excelled in reading and writing, but was mostly known for his pranks, mischief, and sense of humor. Practical jokes helped Harris cloak his shyness and insecurities about his red hair, Irish ancestry, and illegitimacy, leading to both trouble and a reputation as a leader among the older boys.

=== Turnwold Plantation: 1862–1866 ===
At the age of 14, Harris quit school to work. In March 1862, Joseph Addison Turner, owner of Turnwold Plantation nine miles east of Eatonton, hired Harris to work as a printer&#x27;s devil for his newspaper &quot;The Countryman&quot;. Harris worked for clothing, room, and board. The newspaper reached subscribers throughout the Confederacy during the Civil War; it was considered one of the larger newspapers in the South, with a circulation of about 2,000. Harris learned to set type for the paper, and Turner allowed him to publish his own poems, book reviews, and humorous paragraphs.

Turner&#x27;s instruction and technical expertise exerted a profound influence on Harris. During his four-year tenure at Turnwold Plantation, Joel Harris consumed the literature in Turner&#x27;s library. He had access to Chaucer, Dickens, Sir Thomas Browne, &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Thackeray, and Edgar Allan Poe. Turner, a fiercely independent Southern loyalist and eccentric intellectual, emphasized the work of southern writers, yet stressed that Harris read widely. In &quot;The Countryman&quot; Turner insisted that Harris not shy away from including humor in his journalism.

While at Turnwold Plantation, Harris spent hundreds of hours in the slave quarters during time off. He was less self-conscious there and felt his humble background as an illegitimate, red-headed son of an Irish immigrant helped foster an intimate connection with the slaves. He absorbed the stories, language, and inflections of people like Uncle George Terrell, Old Harbert, and Aunt Crissy. The African-American animal tales they shared later became the foundation and inspiration for Harris&#x27;s Uncle Remus tales. George Terrell and Old Harbert in particular became models for Uncle Remus, as well as role models for Harris.

=== Savannah and the South: 1866–1876 ===

Joseph Addison Turner shut down &quot;The Countryman&quot; in May 1866. Joel Harris left the plantation with worthless Confederate money and very few possessions. He lived for a period at The Marshall House.

&quot;The Macon Telegraph&quot; hired Harris as a typesetter later that year. Harris found the work unsatisfactory and himself the butt of jokes around the office, in no small part due to his red hair. Within five months, he accepted a job working for the &quot;New Orleans Crescent Monthly&quot;, a literary journal. Just six months after that, homesick, he returned to Georgia, but with another opportunity at the &quot;Monroe Advertiser&quot;, a weekly paper published in Forsyth, Georgia.

At the &quot;Advertiser&quot; Harris found a regional audience with his column &quot;Affairs of Georgia.&quot; Newspapers across the state reprinted his humorous paragraphs and political barbs. Harris&#x27; reputation earned him the position of associate editor at the &quot;Savannah Morning News&quot;, the largest circulation newspaper in Georgia. Though he relished his position in Forsyth, Joe Harris accepted the $40-a-week job, a significant pay increase, and quickly established himself as Georgia&#x27;s leading humor columnist while at the &quot;Morning News&quot;.

In 1872 Harris met Mary Esther LaRose, a seventeen-year-old French-Canadian from Quebec. After a year of courtship, Harris and LaRose married in April 1873. LaRose was 18, and Harris 27 (though publicly admitting to 24). Over the next three years, the couple had two children. Their life in Savannah came to an abrupt halt, however, when they fled to Atlanta to avoid a yellow fever epidemic.

=== Atlanta: 1876–1908 ===
In 1876 Harris was hired by Henry W. Grady at &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;, where he would remain for the next 24 years. He worked with other journalists including Frank Lebby Stanton, who was in turn an associate of James Whitcomb Riley. Chandler supported the racial reconciliation envisioned by Grady. He often took the mule-drawn trolley to work, picked up his assignments, and brought them home to complete. He wrote for the &quot;Constitution&quot; until 1900.

In addition, he published local-color stories in magazines such as &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;The Century&quot;.

====Uncle Remus stories and later years====
Not long after taking the newspaper appointment, Harris began writing the Uncle Remus stories as a serial to &quot;preserve in permanent shape those curious mementoes of a period that will no doubt be sadly misrepresented by historians of the future.&quot; The tales were reprinted across the United States, and Harris was approached by publisher D. Appleton and Company to compile them for a book.

&quot;Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings&quot; was published near the end of 1880. Hundreds of newspapers reviewed the best-seller, and Harris received national attention. Of the press and attention Walter Hines Page noted, &quot;Joe Harris does not appreciate Joel Chandler Harris.&quot;

Royalties from the book were modest, but allowed Harris to rent a six-room house in West End, an unincorporated village on the outskirts of Atlanta, to accommodate his growing family. Two years later Harris bought the house and hired the architect George Humphries to transform the farmhouse into a Queen Anne Victorian in the Eastlake style. The home, soon thereafter called The Wren&#x27;s Nest, was where Harris spent most of his time.

Harris preferred to write at the Wren&#x27;s Nest. He published prodigiously throughout the 1880s and 1890s, trying his hand at novels, children&#x27;s literature, and a translation of French folklore. Yet he rarely strayed from home and work during this time. He chose to stay close to his family and his gardening. Harris and his wife Essie had seven more children in Atlanta, with a total of six (out of nine) surviving past childhood.

By the late 1890s, Harris was tired of the newspaper grind and suffered from health problems, likely stemming from alcoholism. At the same time, he grew more comfortable with his creative persona.

Harris retired from the &quot;Constitution&quot; in 1900. He continued experimenting with novels and wrote articles for outlets such as &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Still, he remained close to home, refusing to travel to accept honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and Emory College (now Emory University). In 1905 Harris was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Harris traveled to accept an invitation to the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt. Two years earlier, Roosevelt had said, &quot;Presidents may come and presidents may go, but Uncle Remus stays put. Georgia has done a great many things for the Union, but she has never done more than when she gave Mr. Joel Chandler Harris to American literature.&quot;

On July 3, 1908, Joel Chandler Harris died of acute nephritis and complications from cirrhosis of the liver. In his obituary, the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; echoed Roosevelt&#x27;s sentiment, stating: &quot;Uncle Remus cannot die. Joel Chandler Harris has departed this life at the age of 60 ... but his best creation, [Uncle Remus] with his fund of folk-lore, will live in literature.&quot;

== Writing ==

=== Folklore ===
Harris created the first version of the Uncle Remus character for &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; in 1876 after inheriting a column formerly written by Samuel W. Small, who had taken leave from the paper. In these character sketches, Remus would visit the newspaper office to discuss the social and racial issues of the day. By 1877, Small had returned to the &quot;Constitution&quot; and resumed his column.

Harris did not intend to continue the Remus character. But when Small left the paper again, Harris reprised Remus. He realized the literary value of the stories he had heard from the slaves of Turnwold Plantation. Harris set out to record the stories and insisted that they be verified by two independent sources before he would publish them. He found the research more difficult given his professional duties, urban location, race and, eventually, fame.

On July 20, 1879, Harris published &quot;The Story of Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Fox as Told by Uncle Remus&quot; in &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;. It was the first of 34 plantation fables that would be compiled in &quot;Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings&quot; (1880). The stories, mostly collected directly from the African-American oral storytelling tradition, were revolutionary in their use of dialect, animal personages, and serialized landscapes.

Remus&#x27; stories featured a trickster hero called Br&#x27;er Rabbit (Brother Rabbit), who used his wits against adversity, though his efforts did not always succeed. Br&#x27;er Rabbit is a direct interpretation of Yoruba tales of Hare, though some others posit Native American influences as well. The scholar Stella Brewer Brookes asserts, &quot;Never has the trickster been better exemplified than in the Br&#x27;er Rabbit of Harris.&quot; Br&#x27;er Rabbit was accompanied by friends and enemies, such as Br&#x27;er Fox, Br&#x27;er Bear, Br&#x27;er Terrapin, and Br&#x27;er Wolf. The stories represented a significant break from the fairy tales of the Western tradition: instead of a singular event in a singular story, the critters on the plantation existed in an ongoing community saga, time immemorial.

The Uncle Remus stories garnered critical acclaim and achieved popular success well into the 20th century. Harris published at least twenty-nine books, of which nine books were compiled of his published Uncle Remus stories, including &quot;Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings&quot; (1880), &quot;Nights with Uncle Remus&quot; (1883), &quot;Uncle Remus and His Friends&quot; (1892), &quot;The Tar Baby and Other Rhymes of Uncle Remus&quot; (1904), &quot;Told by Uncle Remus: New Stories of the Old Plantation&quot; (1905), &quot;Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit&quot; (1907). The last three books written by Joel Chandler Harris were published after his death which included &quot;Uncle Remus and the Little Boy&quot; (1910), &quot;Uncle Remus Returns&quot; (1918), and &quot;Seven Tales of Uncle Remus&quot; (1948). The tales, 185 in sum, became immensely popular among both black and white readers in the North and South. Few people outside of the South had heard accents like those spoken in the tales, and the dialect had never been legitimately and faithfully recorded in print. To Northern and international readers, the stories were a &quot;revelation of the unknown.&quot; Mark Twain noted in 1883, &quot;in the matter of writing [the African-American dialect], he is the only master the country has produced.&quot;

The stories introduced international readers to the American South. Rudyard Kipling wrote in a letter to Harris that the tales &quot;ran like wild fire through an English Public school. ... [We] found ourselves quoting whole pages of Uncle Remus that had got mixed in with the fabric of the old school life.&quot; The Uncle Remus tales have since been translated into more than forty languages.

James Weldon Johnson called the collection &quot;the greatest body of folklore America has produced&quot;.

=== Journalism ===
Early in his career at the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;, Joe Harris laid out his editorial ideology and set the tone for an agenda that aimed to help reconcile issues of race, class, and region: &quot;An editor must have a purpose. ... What a legacy for one&#x27;s conscience to know that one has been instrumental in mowing down the old prejudices that rattle in the wind like weeds.&quot;

Harris served as assistant editor and lead editorial writer at &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; primarily between 1876 and 1900. He published articles intermittently until his death in 1908. While at the &quot;Constitution&quot;, Harris, &quot;in thousands of signed and unsigned editorials over a twenty-four-year period, ... set a national tone for reconciliation between North and South after the Civil War&quot;.

Throughout his career, Harris actively promoted racial reconciliation as well as African-American education, suffrage, and equality. He regularly denounced racism among southern whites, condemned lynching, and highlighted the importance of higher education for African Americans, frequently citing the work of W.E.B. Du Bois in his editorials. In 1883, for example, the &quot;New York Sun&quot; had an editorial: &quot;educating the negro will merely increase his capacity for evil.&quot; &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; editorial countered with: if &quot;education of the negro is not the chief solution of the problem that confronts the white people of the South then there is no other conceivable solution and there is nothing ahead but political chaos and demoralization.&quot;

Harris&#x27;s editorials were often progressive in content and paternalistic in tone. He was committed to the &quot;dissipation of sectional jealousy and misunderstanding, as well as religious and racial intolerance&quot;, yet &quot;never entirely freed himself of the idea that the [southern whites] would have to patronize the [southern blacks].&quot;

Harris also oversaw some of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;″s most sensationalized coverage of racial issues, including the 1899 torture and lynching of Sam Hose, an African-American farm worker. Harris resigned from the paper the following year, having lost patience for publishing both &quot;his iconoclastic views on race&quot; and &quot;what was expected of him&quot; at a major southern newspaper during a particularly vitriolic period.

In 1904 Harris wrote four important articles for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; discussing the problem of race relations in the South; these highlighted his progressive yet paternalistic views. Of these, Booker T. Washington wrote to him:

It has been a long time since I have read anything from the pen of any man which has given me such encouragement as your article has. ... In a speech on Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday which I am to deliver in New York, I am going to take the liberty to quote liberally from what you have said.

Two years later, Harris and his son Julian founded what would become &quot;Uncle Remus&#x27;s Home Magazine&quot;. Harris wrote to Andrew Carnegie that its purpose would be to further &quot;the obliteration of prejudice against the blacks, the demand for a square deal, and the uplifting of both races so that they can look justice in the face without blushing.&quot; Circulation reached 240,000 within one year, making it one of the largest magazines in the country.

=== Other works ===
Harris wrote novels, narrative histories, translations of French folklore, children&#x27;s literature, and collections of stories depicting rural life in Georgia. The short stories &quot;Free Joe and the Rest of the World&quot;, &quot;Mingo&quot;, and &quot;At Teague Poteets&quot; are the most influential of his non-Uncle Remus creative work. Many of his short stories delved into the changing social and economic values in the South during Reconstruction. Harris&#x27;s turn as a local colorist gave voice to poor white characters and demonstrated his fluency with different African-American dialects and characters.

== Legacy ==
Harris&#x27; books exerted a profound influence on storytellers at home and abroad, yet the Uncle Remus tales effectively have no critical standing. His legacy is, at the same time, not without controversy: Harris&#x27; critical reputation in the 20th and 21st Centuries has been mixed, as some accused him of appropriating African-American culture.

=== Criticism ===
Critic H. L. Mencken held a less than favorable view of Harris:

Once upon a time a Georgian printed a couple of books that attracted notice, but immediately it turned out that he was little more than an amanuensis for the local blacks—that his works were really the products, not of white Georgia, but of black Georgia. Writing afterward as a white man, he swiftly subsided into the fifth rank.

Keith Cartwright, however, asserts, &quot;Harris might arguably be called the greatest single authorial force behind the literary development of African American folk matter and manner.&quot;

In 1981 the writer Alice Walker accused Harris of &quot;stealing a good part of my heritage&quot; in a searing essay called &quot;Uncle Remus, No Friend of Mine&quot;. Toni Morrison wrote a novel called &quot;Tar Baby.&quot; Such a character appears in a folktale recorded by Harris. In interviews, Morrison said she learned the story from her family and owed no debt to him.

Scholars have questioned the authenticity of his main works, citing the difficulty that many white folklorists had in persuading African Americans to divulge their folklore. But, others note the similarity of African folk stories in several sources that are similar to the Brer Rabbit tales as published, which represent a folk genre. Examples include the Ila language &quot;Sulwe mbwakatizha Muzovu&quot; (&quot;Hare makes the elephant afraid&quot;) in Smith &amp; Dale &quot;The Ila-Speaking Peoples of Northern Rhodesia&quot; volume 2, page 309. In the totally unrelated Kanuri or Bornuese culture in Northern Nigeria, such tales as a &quot;Fable of Jackal and a Hyena&quot; display similar themes quite in the Brer Rabbit manner. The difficulties in obtaining printed sources on the African languages may have inhibited these aspects of critical treatment. Some critical scholars cite Uncle Remus as a problematic and contradictory figure: sometimes a mouthpiece for white paternalism, sometimes a stereotype of the black entertainer, and sometimes poetically subversive.

Julius Lester, a black folklorist and university professor, sees the Uncle Remus stories as important records of black folklore. He has rewritten many of the Harris stories in an effort to elevate the subversive elements over the purportedly racist ones. Regarding the nature of the Uncle Remus character, Lester said,

There are no inaccuracies in Harris&#x27;s characterization of Uncle Remus. Even the most cursory reading of the slave narratives collected by the Federal Writer&#x27;s Project of the 1930s reveals that there were many slaves who fit the Uncle Remus mold.

The author Ralph Ellison was positive about Harris&#x27; work:

Aesop and Uncle Remus had taught us that comedy is a disguised form of philosophical instruction; and especially when it allows us to glimpse the animal instincts lying beneath the surface of our civilized affectations.

Some 21st-century scholars have argued that the Uncle Remus tales satirized the very &quot;plantation school&quot; that some readers believed his work supported. Critic Robert Cochran noted: &quot;Harris went to the world as the trickster Brer Rabbit, and in the trickster Uncle Remus he projected both his sharpest critique of things as they were and the deepest image of his heart&#x27;s desire.&quot; Harris omitted the Southern plantation house, disparaged the white Southern gentleman, and presented miscegenation in positive terms. He violated social codes and presented an ethos that would have otherwise shocked his reading audience. These recent acknowledgements echo early observations from Walter Hines Page, who wrote in 1884 that Harris &quot;hardly conceals his scorn for the old aristocracy&quot; and makes &quot;a sly thrust at the pompous life of the Old South.&quot;

More recently, the scholars Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Maria Tatar debated whether to include Uncle Remus stories in their 2017 volume, &quot;The Annotated African American Folktales&quot;. Ultimately they decided on inclusion, along with a detailed preface on the critical issues surrounding Harris, race, and cultural appropriation.

=== Influence ===
Children&#x27;s literature analyst John Goldthwaite argues that the Uncle Remus tales are &quot;irrefutably the central event in the making of modern children&#x27;s story.&quot; Harris&#x27;s influence on British children&#x27;s writers such as Kipling, Milne, Potter, Burgess and Blyton is substantial. His influence on modernism is less overt, but also evident in the works of Pound, Eliot, Joyce, and Faulkner.

Beatrix Potter illustrated eight scenes from the Uncle Remus stories between 1893 and 1896, coinciding with her first drawings of Peter Rabbit. Potter&#x27;s family had favored the Uncle Remus stories during her youth, and she was particularly impressed by the way Harris turned &quot;the ordinary into the extraordinary.&quot; Potter borrowed some of the language from the Uncle Remus stories, adopting the words: &quot;cottontail&quot;, &quot;puddle-duck&quot;, and &quot;lippity-(c)lippity&quot; into her own work.

Mark Twain incorporated several of the Uncle Remus stories into readings during his book tour. He wrote to William Dean Howells in the early 1880s, reporting that the &quot;Tar Baby&quot; had been received &quot;best of all&quot; at a reading in Hartford. Twain admired Harris&#x27; use of dialect. He appropriated exchanges and turns of phrase in many of his works, most notably in &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot;.

A.A. Milne borrowed diction, plot, and narrative structure from several Brer Rabbit stories. &quot;Pooh Goes Visiting&quot; and &quot;Heyo, House!&quot; are particularly similar. As a boy, Milne recalled listening to his father read one Uncle Remus story per night, and referred to it as &quot;the sacred book.&quot;

Charles Chesnutt&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot;, is strongly influenced by the Uncle Remus tales; he features Uncle Julius as the main character and storyteller. Chesnutt read the Uncle Remus stories to his own children.

Many scholars cite Harris&#x27; influence on William Faulkner, most importantly in terms of dialect usage, depictions of African Americans, lower-class whites, and fictionalized landscape.

Poets Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot corresponded in Uncle Remus-inspired dialect, referring to themselves as &quot;Brer Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Old Possum&quot;, respectively. Eventually the dialect and the personae became a sign of their collaboration against the London literary establishment. Eliot titled one of his books &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;.

Ralph Bakshi wrote and directed a 1975 American live action/animated crime film titled &quot;Coonskin&quot; based on Harris&#x27; Brothers rabbit, fox, and bear who rise to the top of the organized crime racket in Harlem, encountering corrupt law enforcement, con artists, and the Mafia.

=== &quot;Song of the South&quot; ===
In 1946, The Walt Disney Company produced a film based on the Uncle Remus tales called &quot;Song of the South&quot;. While commercially successful during its original release and re-releases, the film has never been released for home consumption in the United States as, since its release, the film was criticized for the way it portrays its characters and the Southern U. S. in regard to slavery, even though the film&#x27;s events take place in the postbellum South, when slavery had ended. &quot;Song of the South&quot; has been released on video in a number of overseas markets, and on LaserDisc in Japan.
The film earned mixed critical reviews and two Academy Awards. James Baskett won an honorary Academy Award for his portrayal of Uncle Remus, and &quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; was presented with the award for Best Original Song. Walter White of the NAACP acknowledged &quot;the remarkable artistic merit&quot; of the film in his telegraphed press release on November 27, 1946, but decried the &quot;impression it gives of an idyllic master-slave relationship.&quot;

Since its debut, the public perception of Harris and the Uncle Remus stories has largely been tied to the reception of &quot;Song of the South&quot;.

Here he advanced from printer&#x27;s devil to accomplished journalist. Of his duties, Harris said: &quot;I set all the type, pulled the press, kept the books, swept the floor and wrapped the papers for mailing.&quot; His typestand is still in use at the present office of The Monroe Advertiser.

<text>42nd Street is a major crosstown street in the New York City borough of Manhattan, spanning the entire breadth of Midtown Manhattan, from Turtle Bay at the East River, to Hell&#x27;s Kitchen at the Hudson River on the West Side. The street has several major landmarks, including (from east to west) the headquarters of the United Nations, the Chrysler Building, Grand Central Terminal, the New York Public Library Main Branch, Times Square, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. 

The street is known for its theaters, especially near the intersection with Broadway at Times Square, and as such is also the name of the region of the theater district (and, at times, the red-light district) near that intersection.

==History==
===Early history===
During the American Revolutionary War, a cornfield near 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was where General George Washington angrily attempted to rally his troops after the British landing at Kip&#x27;s Bay, which scattered many of the American militiamen. Washington&#x27;s attempt put him in danger of being captured, and his officers had to persuade him to leave. The rout eventually subsided into an orderly retreat.

John Jacob Astor purchased a farm in 1803 that ran from 42nd Street to 46th Street west of Broadway to the Hudson River.

=== 19th century ===
The street was designated by the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 that established the Manhattan street grid as one of 15 crosstown (east-west) streets that would be in width, while other streets were designated as in width.

In 1835, the city&#x27;s Street Committee, after receiving numerous complaints about lack of access for development above 14th Street, decided to open up all lots which had already been plotted on the city grid up to 42nd Street, which thus became – for a time – the northern boundary of the city.

Cornelius Vanderbilt began the construction of Grand Central Depot in 1869 on 42nd Street at Fourth Avenue as the terminal for his Central, Hudson, Harlem and New Haven commuter rail lines, because city regulations required that trains be pulled by horse below 42nd Street. The Depot, which opened in 1871, was replaced by Grand Central Terminal in 1913.

Between the 1870s and 1890s, 42nd Street became the uptown boundary of the mainstream theatre district, which started around 23rd Street, as the entertainment district of the Tenderloin gradually moved northward.

=== Early 20th century ===
42nd Street was developed relatively late compared to other crosstown thoroughfares such as 14th Street and 23rd Street, which had grown during the American Civil War, and 57th Street, which became prominent in the 1890s. It was only after the beginning of the 20th century that the street saw entertainment venues being developed around Times Square and upscale office space around Grand Central Terminal. In the first two decades of the 20th century, eleven venues for legitimate theatre were built within one block of West 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.

The corner of 42nd Street and Broadway, at the southeast corner of Times Square, is the eastern terminus of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States, which was conceived and mapped in 1913.

An elevated railroad line, running above East 42nd Street from Third Avenue to the Grand Central station, was closed in 1923, leading to the development of such structures as the Chanin Building and 110 East 42nd Street west of Lexington Avenue. The street east of Lexington Avenue continued to be made up of mostly low-rise buildings; these blocks were adjacent to the elevated IRT Second Avenue Line and IRT Third Avenue Line, and accordingly, initially considered unattractive for major development. By the 1920s, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that several high-rise developments were &quot;radically changing the old-time conditions&quot; along East 42nd Street, including the Chanin, Lincoln, Chrysler, and Daily News Buildings, as well as Tudor City.

The block of 42nd Street between Second and First Avenues was originally only wide, passing through a steep bluff known as Prospect Hill. On either side of the street, service roads ascended to Tudor City Place, which crossed over 42nd Street. To improve access to the newly developed United Nations headquarters, in 1948, the city government proposed widening that block of 42nd Street, eliminating the service roads, and constructing a viaduct to carry Tudor City Place over 42nd Street. Despite opposition from Tudor City residents, city officials said the street widening was necessary because 42nd Street already carried high amounts of vehicular traffic to and from the nearby FDR Drive. The New York City Planning Commission approved the plans in September 1948, and the Board of Estimate approved $1.848 million for the project that December. The board provisionally authorized the street widening in June 1949, and Manhattan&#x27;s borough president announced in December 1949 that work would commence shortly. The neighboring stretch of 42nd Street was temporarily closed from February 1951 to October 1952 while the widening was underway.

=== Theatrical decline ===
West 42nd Street, meanwhile, prospered as a theater and entertainment district until World War II. According to historian Robert A. M. Stern, West 42nd Street&#x27;s decline started in 1946, when the streetcars on 42nd Street were replaced by less efficient buses.

Lloyd Bacon and Busby Berkeley&#x27;s 1933 film musical &quot;42nd Street&quot;, starring 30s heartthrobs Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, displays the bawdy and colorful mixture of Broadway denizens and lowlifes in Manhattan during the Depression. In 1980, it was turned into a successful Broadway musical which ran until 1989, and which was revived for a four-year run in 2001. In the words of the Al Dubin and Harry Warren title song, on 42nd Street one could find:

Little from the Fifties, innocent and sweet,

Sexy ladies from the Eighties who are indiscreet,

They&#x27;re side by side, they&#x27;re glorified,

Where the underworld can meet the elite

Naughty, gawdy, bawdy, sporty, Forty-second Street!

From the late 1950s until the late 1980s, 42nd Street, nicknamed the &quot;Deuce&quot;, was the cultural center of American grindhouse theaters, which spawned an entire subculture. The book &quot;Sleazoid Express&quot;, a travelogue of the 42nd Street grindhouses and the films they showed, describes the unique blend of people who made up the theater-goers:

depressives hiding from jobs, sexual obsessives, inner-city people seeking cheap diversions, teenagers skipping school, adventurous couples on dates, couples-chasers peeking on them, people getting high, homeless people sleeping, pickpockets...

While the street outside the theatres was populated with:

phony drug salesman ... low-level drug dealers, chain snatchers ... [j]unkies alone in their heroin/cocaine dreamworld ... predatory chickenhawks spying on underage trade looking for pickups ... male prostitutes of all ages ... [t]ranssexuals, hustlers, and closety gays with a fetishistic homo- or heterosexual itch to scratch ... It was common to see porn stars whose films were playing at the adult houses promenade down the block. ... Were you a freak? Not when you stepped onto the Deuce. Being a freak there would get you money, attention, entertainment, a starring part in a movie. Or maybe a robbery and a beating.
For much of the mid and late 20th century, the area of 42nd Street near Times Square was home to activities often considered unsavory, including peep shows.

East 42nd Street was, for some time, spared from similar decline, especially east of Third Avenue, where the development of the United Nations supported a thriving business district and prompted the widening of that section of 42nd Street. The demolition of the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines by the 1950s led to increased development on East 42nd Street, such as annexes to the Chrysler and Daily News Buildings, as well as the construction of the Socony–Mobil and Ford Foundation Buildings. By the 1960s, East 42nd Street between Park and Second Avenues contained more headquarters of industries than any other place in the United States except Chicago or Pittsburgh. During this time, there was much development outside the rundown entertainment district of Times Square, somewhat offsetting the perception of that part of 42nd Street.

=== Revitalization ===
In the early 1990s, the city government encouraged a cleanup of the Times Square area. In 1990, the city government took over six of the historic theatres on the block of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and New 42nd Street, a not-for-profit organization, was formed to oversee their renovation and reuse, as well as to construct new theatres and a rehearsal space. In 1993, Disney Theatrical Productions bought the New Amsterdam Theatre, which it renovated a few years later. Since the mid-1990s, the block has again become home to mainstream theatres and several multi-screen mainstream movie theatres, along with shops, restaurants, hotels, and attractions such as Madame Tussauds wax museum and Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not that draw millions to the city every year. This area is now co-signed as &quot;New 42nd Street&quot; to signify this change.

In the 1990s, the renovation of Bryant Park between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, as well as the renovations of Times Square and Grand Central Terminal, led to increases in office occupancy along both sections of 42nd Street.

In 2025, the New York City Department of Transportation announced that the block of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues would be upgraded to protect it from terrorist attacks. The project, budgeted at $57 million, would include adding steel bollards, installing sewage pipes, and widening the sidewalks and bus lanes.

* ()

There are two subway lines under 42nd Street. The 42nd Street Shuttle () runs under 42nd Street between Broadway/Seventh Avenue (Times Square) and Park Avenue (Grand Central). The IRT Flushing Line () curves from Eleventh Avenue to 41st Street, under which it runs until Fifth Avenue; shifts to 42nd Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues; and continues under the East River to Queens. Each line stops at Times Square and Grand Central, though the Fifth Avenue station is also served by the .

* 42nd Street on the IRT Second Avenue Line
* 42nd Street on the IRT Third Avenue Line
* 42nd Street on the IRT Sixth Avenue Line
* 42nd Street on the IRT Ninth Avenue Line

===Bus===
MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27;s M42 bus runs the length of 42nd Street between the Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises ferry terminal on the Hudson River and the headquarters of the United Nations on the East River. Westbound service originates at First Avenue. Its predecessor, the 42nd Street Crosstown Line streetcar, had used 42nd Street until 1946. In 2019, bus lanes were installed along the length of the street. There have also been proposals for light rail on 42nd Street over the years, such as in 2005.

42nd Street is also used by the Staten Island express buses.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Dorty-deuce&quot; is street slang for Manhattan&#x27;s former live peep show district on 42nd Street. The 1982 film &quot;Forty Deuce&quot; and the 2017 TV series &quot;The Deuce&quot; reference the phrase &quot;forty-deuce&quot;.

Notable CCP Politboro Standing Committee member Wang Huning referenced 42nd Street in his book America Against America mentioning it&#x27;s &quot;pornographic culture&quot; as an example of the &quot;decadence of high commodification&quot;.

<text>A Farewell to Arms is a novel by American writer Ernest Hemingway, set during the Italian campaign of World War I. First published in 1929, it is a first-person account of an American, Frederic Henry, serving as a lieutenant () in the ambulance corps of the Italian Army. The novel describes a love affair between the American expatriate and an English nurse, Catherine Barkley.

Its publication ensured Hemingway&#x27;s place as a modern American writer of considerable stature. The book became his first best-seller and has been called &quot;the premier American war novel from [...] World War I&quot;. The title might be taken from a 16thcentury poem of the same name by the English dramatist George Peele.

The novel has been adapted a number of times: initially for the stage in 1930; as a film in 1932, and again in 1957; and as a three-part television miniseries in 1966. The film &quot;In Love and War&quot;, made in 1996, depicts Hemingway&#x27;s life in Italy as an ambulance driver in events prior to his writing of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;.

As of January 1, 2025, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is in public domain.

==Plot summary==
The novel is divided into five sections, or &quot;books&quot;. Frederic Henry narrates the story in the first-person.

=== Book One ===
Lieutenant Frederic Henry is an American medic serving in the Italian Army, who speaks Italian. The novel begins during the First World War. It is the start of winter, when a cholera epidemic kills thousands of soldiers. Frederic visits Gorizia, where he meets other army fellows and the priest. He finds there are two brothels one for officers and the other for lower-rank soldiers. On his return, he shares his experience with his friend, Surgeon Rinaldi, who is about the same age as Frederic.

Rinaldi is fond of beautiful women. He has fallen in love with an English nurse named Catherine Barkley, though not so seriously. Rinaldi takes Frederic to a British hospital, where Frederic is introduced to, and attracted to, Catherine. She tells him about her fiancé, who was killed in battle, and also about feeling uncomfortable in the rain, as it starts to rain. Frederic tries to kiss her, but she refuses and slaps him. She regrets doing so and eventually warms to him and they kiss.

Frederic and his fellow drivers (Passini, Manera, Gordini and Gavuzzi) take the ambulance into war. Passini is killed in a mortar attack. Frederic is severely wounded in the knee on the Italian front and is sent to the hospital.

=== Book Two ===
Surgeon Rinaldi visits Frederic in the hospital and praises him for his heroism, but Frederic denies any display of such. Rinaldi also tells him that he will be shifted to a hospital in Milan soon for a better treatment. Frederic requests him to have Catherine there as a nurse. The priest pays a visit. In a discussion again, Frederic expresses his views against war. Meanwhile, America has declared war on Germany, and the Italian army is also anxious about war against Austria. Frederic reaches an American hospital in Milan. There he is nursed by Miss Gage, Mrs. Walker and their Superintendent Miss Van Campen. Miss Gage arranges wine for him. Catherine arrives there, and Frederic realizes a strong sense of love and passion for her. They make love for the first time. Doctor Valentini comes to examine his injury and X-rays. This book portrays the growth of Frederic&#x27;s relationship with Catherine over the summer. They enjoy boating and horse races. Meanwhile, Frederic meets Helen Ferguson, a fellow nurse of Catherine. After his knee heals, Frederic is diagnosed with jaundice. A three-weeks convalescent leave is sanctioned for him. Miss Van Campen discovers empty liquor bottles in Frederic&#x27;s room and takes alcoholism as the cause for his condition. She also concludes that Frederic is knowingly keeping himself ill to avoid the war front. She files a report for the cancellation of convalescent leave, and Frederic is called back to the war front. Catherine informs him that she is three-months pregnant. They promise to reunite and marry after his return from war. Frederic asks her to take care of &quot;Little Catherine&quot;.

=== Book Three ===
Frederic returns to Gorizia. Rinaldi comes and examines his wounded leg. He further asks whether they have married or not. The priest notices a change in Frederic and also predicts that the war will end soon. Frederic travels to Bainsizza, where he meets Gino, who tells him about an artillery battery of terrifying guns that the Austrians have. Frederic realizes that Italians will not escape if the Austrians attack. It rains heavily, and the bombarding begins. Frederic discovers that morale has severely dropped. Not long afterwards, the Austro-Hungarians break through the Italian lines in the Battle of Caporetto, and the Italians retreat. The houses are evacuated. Women and children are loaded in trucks. At the villa, Frederic discovers that Rinaldi has taken off for the hospital; everyone else has evacuated too. There is considerable delay and chaos on the road during the retreat, and Frederic, wishing to avoid a possible aerial attack while stuck on the main retreat route, decides to take an alternate path. He and his men quickly get lost, and their cars are stuck in the mud, Frederic orders the two engineering sergeants riding with Bonello to help. Afraid of being overtaken by the enemy, they refuse and try to leave. Frederic draws his gun and shoots one of them; the other escapes. One of the drivers, Aymo, is later killed, while another, Bonello, runs away to surrender to the Austrians. Frederic and his last companion, Piani, catch up to the main retreat across the Tagliamento river. As soon as they cross the bridge, Frederic is taken by the military police to a place on the river bank where officers are being interrogated and executed for the &quot;treachery&quot; that supposedly led to the Italian defeat. Frederic escapes by jumping into the river. Afterwards, he walks through the plains and jumps aboard a moving train to Milan to find Catherine.

=== Book Four ===
Reaching Milan, he learns that Catherine has left for Stresa. He goes to visit Ralph Simmons, one of the opera singers that he encountered earlier, and asks about the procedures for traveling to Switzerland. Ralph helps him, giving him civilian clothes. Frederic feels very odd in those clothes, as the people look at him scornfully. He reaches Stresa by train and goes to the Grand Hotel des Iles Borromées. Emilio, a bartender, informs him that two English nurses are staying at a small hotel near the train station. Frederic meets Catherine and Helen Ferguson there. He also meets Count Greffi, a very old nobleman whom Frederic had met on his last visit to Stresa. Greffi is staying with his niece. Frederic avoids Catherine&#x27;s question about the war experiences. He feels that he is a criminal, a war deserter. Emilio informs him that Italian police are looking to arrest him. Catherine and Frederic plan to flee to Switzerland as Emilio makes all possible arrangements for their travel in a rowboat. Because of a storm, the waters are choppy and rough. Frederic rows the boat all night, and Catherine also takes a turn rowing. Finally, they reach Switzerland. The guards verify their identity and provide them provisional visas for staying in Switzerland.

=== Book Five ===
Frederic and Catherine live a quiet life in the mountains. They move to a wooden house on a mountain outside the village of Montreux. They develop new acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs. Guttingen. At times, Catherine starts getting concerned about their child, especially about its health. They move to the town of Lausanne to be closer to the hospital. Later, Catherine goes into labor and is taken to the hospital. The doctor tells Frederic that the best solution would be a caesarean operation. She suffers a lot of pain and finally delivers a stillborn baby boy. Later the nurse tells him that Catherine is hemorrhaging. He is terrified. He goes to see her, and she dies with him by her side. He leaves the hospital and walks back to his hotel in the rain.

==Background and publication history==
The novel was partly based on Hemingway&#x27;s own experiences serving in the Italian campaigns during the First World War. The inspiration for Catherine Barkley was Agnes von Kurowsky, a nurse who cared for Hemingway in a hospital in Milan after he had been wounded. He had planned to marry her, but she spurned his love when he returned to America. Kitty Cannell, a Paris-based fashion correspondent, became Helen Ferguson. The unnamed priest was based on Don Giuseppe Bianchi, the priest of the 69th and 70th regiments of the Brigata Ancona. Although the sources for Rinaldi are unknown, the character had already appeared in &quot;In Our Time&quot;.

Much of the plot was written in correspondence with Frederic J. Agate. Agate, Hemingway&#x27;s friend, had a collection of letters to his wife from his time in Italy, which were later used as inspiration.

Michael Reynolds, however, writes that Hemingway was not involved in the battles described. Because his previous novel, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, had been written as a &quot;roman à clef&quot;, readers assumed &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; to be autobiographical.
&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; was begun during his time at Willis M. Spear&#x27;s guest ranch in Wyoming&#x27;s Bighorns. Some pieces of the novel were written in Piggott, Arkansas, at the home of his then-wife Pauline Pfeiffer, and in Mission Hills, Kansas, while she was awaiting delivery of their baby. Pauline underwent a caesarean section as Hemingway was writing the scene about Catherine Barkley&#x27;s childbirth.

Hemingway struggled with the ending. By his count, he wrote 39 versions of it &quot;before [he] was satisfied&quot;. However, a 2012 edition of the book included no fewer than 47 alternate endings.

The novel was first serialized in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in the May 1929 to October 1929 issues. The book was published in September 1929 with a first edition print-run of approximately 31,000 copies. The success of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; made Hemingway financially independent.

&quot;The Hemingway Library Edition&quot; was released in July 2012, with a dust jacket facsimile of the first edition. The newly published edition presents an appendix with the many alternate endings Hemingway wrote for the novel in addition to pieces from early draft manuscripts.

The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum Hemingway collection has two handwritten pages with possible titles for the book. Most of the titles come from &quot;The Oxford Book of English Verse&quot;. One of the possible titles Hemingway considered was &quot;In Another Country and Besides&quot;. This comes from &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot; by Christopher Marlowe. The poem &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; by T. S. Eliot also starts off by quoting this Marlowe work: &quot;Thou hast committed / Fornication: but that was in another country, / And besides, the wench is dead.&quot; Hemingway&#x27;s library included both works by Eliot and Marlowe.

===Censorship===
There are at least two copies of the first edition into which Hemingway had re-inserted the censored text by hand to provide a corrected text. One of these copies was presented to Maurice Coindreau, the other to James Joyce. Hemingway&#x27;s corrected text has not been incorporated into modern published editions of the novel, but there are some audiobook versions that are uncensored.

&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; was banned in the Irish Free State.

Also, the novel could not be published in Italy until 1948 because the Fascist regime considered it detrimental to the honor of the Armed Forces, both in its description of the Battle of Caporetto and because of a certain anti-militarism implied in the work. More than one biographer has suggested that, at the base of the censorship of the Fascist regime in the novel, there had also been a personal antipathy between the writer and Benito Mussolini. Hemingway had interviewed him in 1923, shortly after he had seized power, and in Hemingway&#x27;s article in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; he poured scorn on Mussolini, calling him &quot;the biggest bluff in Europe&quot;. But, apart from the official reactions, it is known that Mussolini did not like the article at all: Hemingway described Mussolini as trying to impress the media by pretending to be deeply absorbed in reading, while in reality he was holding a French–English dictionary upside down. The Italian translation had in fact already been prepared illegally in 1943 by Fernanda Pivano, leading to her arrest in Turin.

==Critical reception==
&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; was met with favorable criticism and is considered one of Hemingway&#x27;s best literary works.

Gore Vidal wrote of the text: &quot;... a work of ambition, in which can be seen the beginning of the careful, artful, immaculate idiocy of tone that since has marked ... [Hemingway&#x27;s] prose&quot;. The last line of the 1929 &quot;New York Times&quot; review reads: &quot;It is a moving and beautiful book.&quot;

Baker remarks on the theme of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;: &quot;After ten years of meditation and digestive of his experience, Hemingway lays before his readers a work which is far from a mere war experience, nor a story of love and death during the war.&quot;

However, since publication, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; has also been the target of various controversy. Upon its flimsy publication—due to the medium of its release—through &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, it was banned from Boston newsstands due to accusations of a pornographic nature, despite Hemingway&#x27;s deliberate exclusion of graphic descriptions of sex, using omission as a literary device.

==In other media==
The novel was first adapted for the stage by Laurence Stallings in 1930, then as a film in 1932, with a 1957 remake. A three-part television miniseries was made in 1966. In December 2023, a new film adaptation was announced, with Michael Winterbottom to direct and Tom Blyth to star.

The 1996 film &quot;In Love and War&quot;, directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Chris O&#x27;Donnell and Sandra Bullock, depicts Hemingway&#x27;s life in Italy as an ambulance driver in the events prior to his writing of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;.

A radio broadcast adaption was produced in 1937 as part of the Lux Radio Theater series, starring Clark Gable and Josephine Hutchinson. In 2011, BBC Radio 4 produced a 10-episode adaptation for their &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; series.

<text>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a 1932 American pre-Code crime tragedy film directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Paul Muni as a convicted man on a chain gang who escapes to Chicago. It was released on November 10, 1932. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor for Muni.

The film was written by Howard J. Green and Brown Holmes from Robert Elliott Burns&#x27;s 1932 autobiography of a similar name &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!&quot; originally serialized in the &quot;True Detective&quot; magazine. The true life story was later the basis for the television movie &quot;The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains&quot; (1987) starring Val Kilmer.

In 1991, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
White American sergeant James Allen returns to civilian life after World War I. He has served with distinction, earning a medal from Allied governments for his bravery, but his war experience has made him restless. His mother and minister brother feel Allen should be grateful for a tedious office clerk job. When he announces that he wants to enter the construction industry and improve society as an engineer, his brother reacts with outrage, but his mother regretfully accepts his ambitions.

He leaves home to find work, but unskilled labor is plentiful, and it is hard for him to find a job. Allen sinks slowly into poverty. In an unnamed Southern state (the events upon which the film was based took place in Georgia), Allen visits a diner with an acquaintance, who forces him at gunpoint to participate in a robbery. The police arrive and shoot and kill his friend. Allen panics and attempts to flee but is caught immediately.

Allen is tried and sentenced to prison with hard labor. He is quickly exposed to the brutal conditions of life on a chain gang. The work is agonizing, and the guards are cruel and sadistically whip prisoners for poor performance. Allen makes friends among the gang members, most notably Bomber Wells, an older murderer and chain gang veteran. The two conspire to stage a breakout.

While working on a railroad, Allen receives assistance from Sebastian T. Yale, a powerfully built prisoner who damages Allen&#x27;s shackles by hammering them with Allen&#x27;s ankles still inside. The following Monday, while on a &quot;bathroom break,&quot; Allen slips out of his chains and runs. Armed guards and bloodhounds give chase, but Allen evades them by changing clothes and hiding at the bottom of a river. He makes it to a nearby town, where he is given money for a train ticket and a room for the night by one of Bomber&#x27;s friends.

Allen makes his way to Chicago, where he obtains a job as a manual laborer and uses his knowledge of engineering and construction to rise to a position of importance within a construction company. Along the way, he becomes romantically involved with his landlady, Marie Woods. Allen grows to loathe Marie, but she discovers his secret and blackmails him into an unhappy marriage.

Trying to forget his troubles, he attends a high-society party at the invitation of his superiors and meets and falls in love with a younger woman named Helen. Marie betrays him to the authorities when he asks for a divorce. Allen describes the inhumane conditions of the chain gangs to the press, becoming national news. Many common citizens express their disgust with the chain gangs and their sympathy for a reformed man such as Allen, while editorials written by Southerners describe his continued freedom as a violation of &quot;state&#x27;s rights.&quot;

The governor of Illinois refuses to release Allen to the custody of the Southern state. Its officials offer Allen a deal: return voluntarily and receive a pardon after 90 days of easy clerical labor. Allen accepts, only to find the proposals were a ruse; he is sent to a chain gang, where he languishes for another year after being denied a pardon.

Reunited with Bomber, Allen decides to escape once more. The two steal a dump truck loaded with dynamite from a work site. While leaning out of his seat to taunt pursuing guards, Bomber gets shot. He takes some of the dynamite, lights it, and throws it at a police car, causing a minor landslide. Shortly afterward, Bomber falls from the truck and dies, causing Allen to stop the vehicle. Allen then uses more dynamite to blow up a bridge he just crossed, allowing him to make a close escape. Allen makes his way north again, evading a relentless manhunt.

Months later, he visits Helen in Chicago to wish her a permanent goodbye. Tearfully, she asks, &quot;Can&#x27;t you tell me where you&#x27;re going? Will you write? Do you need any money?&quot; Allen repeatedly shakes his head as he backs away. Finally, Helen says, &quot;But you must, Jim. How do you live?&quot; Allen&#x27;s face is barely visible in the surrounding gloom as he replies, &quot;I steal,&quot; disappearing into the darkness.

==Development and production==
The film was based on the book &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!&quot; (1932) written by Robert Elliott Burns and published by Vanguard Press. The book recounts Burns&#x27; service on a chain gang while imprisoned in Georgia in the 1920s, his subsequent escape and the furor that developed. The story was first published in January 1932, and serialized in &quot;True Detective&quot; mysteries magazine.

Despite Jack L. Warner&#x27;s and Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s interest in adapting Burns&#x27;s book, the Warner Bros. story department voted against it with a report that concluded: &quot;[T]his book might make a picture if we had no censorship, but all the strong and vivid points in the story are certain to be eliminated by the present censorship board.&quot; The story editor&#x27;s reasons were mostly related to the story&#x27;s violence and the uproar that was sure to explode in the Deep South. In the end, Warner and Zanuck had the final say and approved the project.

Roy Del Ruth, the highest-paid director at Warner Bros., was assigned to direct, but he refused the assignment. In a lengthy memo to supervising producer Hal B. Wallis, Del Ruth explained his decision: &quot;This subject is heavy and morbid...there is not one moment of relief anywhere.&quot; Del Ruth further argued that the story &quot;lacks box-office appeal,&quot; and that offering a depressing story to the public seemed ill-timed, given the harsh reality of the Great Depression outside the walls of the local neighborhood cinema. Mervyn LeRoy, who was at that time directing &quot;42nd Street&quot; (released in 1933), dropped out of the shooting and left the reins to Lloyd Bacon.

LeRoy cast Paul Muni in the role of James Allen after seeing him in a stage production of &quot;Counsellor at Law&quot;. Muni was not impressed with LeRoy upon first meeting him in the Warner Burbank office, but Muni and LeRoy became close friends. LeRoy was present at Muni&#x27;s funeral in 1967 along with Muni&#x27;s agent.

To prepare for the role, Muni conducted several intensive meetings with Robert E. Burns in Burbank to learn how Burns walked and talked, in essence, to catch &quot;the smell of fear.&quot; Muni stated to Burns: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to imitate you; I want to be you.&quot; Muni set the Warner Bros. research department on a quest to procure every available book and magazine article about the penal system. He also met with several California prison guards, even one who had worked on a Southern chain gang. Muni fancied the idea of meeting with a guard or warden still working in Georgia, but Warner studio executives quickly rejected his suggestion.

The final lines in the film, &quot;But you must, Jim. How do you live? I steal&quot;, are among the most famous closing lines in American film. Director Mervyn LeRoy later claimed that the idea for James&#x27; retreat into darkness came to him when a fuse blew on the set, but it had been written into the script.

==Box office==
According to Warner Bros. Records, the film earned $650,000 domestically and $949,000 foreign, making it the studio&#x27;s third-highest success of 1932-33 after &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; and &quot;Forty Second Street&quot;.

==Critical reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96%, based on reviews from 27 critics.

&quot;Variety&quot; reviewer Abel Green wrote in November 1932 that it &quot;is a picture with guts. It grips with its stark realism and packs lots of punch.&quot; And that &quot;The finale is stark in its realism.&quot; The review said, &quot;Muni turns in a pip performance.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; also included a &quot;Miniature&quot; and &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Angle&quot; reviews.

Frederick James Smith in &quot;Liberty&quot; in November 1932 gave the film the top score of 4 stars, &quot;extraordinary&quot;. &quot;Paul Muni is splendid as the chain-gang victim. All the other roles are well done, but they are incidental to Muni and Mervyn Le Roy&#x27;s tense, vigorous direction.&quot;

&quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote in December 1932 that it &quot;is one of the finest to come from Hollywood in many a day. It tells with unflinching realism how chain-gang prisoners are treated and at the same time through its direction and acting it is raised far above the level of mere journalistic exposure. It will bring home the conditions among prisoners to millions of persons&quot;.

Jeremiah Kipp of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote in 2005, &quot;Th[e] soul-crushing horrors of slave labor in the penal system are neatly interwoven into a highly gripping plot.&quot; But Kipp thought, &quot;It feels more like an uncompromising prison film than a message movie, so its frequent heavy-handedness seems more like unabashed pulp rather than sanctimony.&quot;

Kim Newman wrote in 2006 for &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;The most powerful of Warner Brothers’ early 1930s ‘social problem’ films, this indictment of organised cruelty remains potent, hard-hitting melodrama.&quot; And he said it was a &quot; no-holds-barred portrait of institutional bullying for such an early film.&quot;

==Impact on American society==
The film is among the first examples of cinema used to garner sympathy for imprisoned convicts without divulging the actual crimes of the convicts. American audiences began to question the legitimacy of the U.S. legal system, and in January 1933, the film&#x27;s protagonist Robert Elliott Burns, who was still imprisoned in New Jersey, and several other chain gang prisoners nationwide in the U.S., were able to appeal and were released. In January 1933, Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold Hardy, who was also made into a character in the film, sued the studio for one million dollars for displaying &quot;vicious, brutal and false attacks&quot; against him in the film.

<text>Lady for a Day is a 1933 American pre-Code comedy-drama film directed by Frank Capra. The screenplay by Robert Riskin is based on the 1929 short story &quot;Madame La Gimp&quot; by Damon Runyon. It was the first film for which Capra received an Academy Award nomination for Best Director and the first Columbia Pictures release to be nominated for Best Picture. Capra also directed its 1961 remake, &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot;.

==Plot==
The story focuses on Apple Annie (May Robson), an aging and wretched fruit seller in New York City, whose daughter Louise (Jean Parker) has been raised in a Spanish convent since she was an infant. Louise has been led to believe her mother is a society matron named Mrs. E. Worthington Manville who lives at the Hotel Marberry. Annie discovers her charade is in danger of being uncovered when she learns Louise is sailing to New York with her fiancé Carlos (Barry Norton) and his father, Count Romero (Walter Connolly).

Among Annie&#x27;s patrons are Dave the Dude (Warren William), a gambling gangster who believes her apples bring him good luck, and his henchman Happy McGuire (Ned Sparks). Annie&#x27;s friends from the street ask Dave to rent her an apartment at the Marberry and, although he initially declines, he has a change of heart and arranges for her to live in the lap of luxury in a palatial residence belonging to a friend. His girlfriend, nightclub owner Missouri Martin (Glenda Farrell), helps transform Annie from a dowdy street peddler to an elegant dowager. Dave arranges for erudite pool hustler Henry D. Blake (Guy Kibbee) to pose as Annie&#x27;s second husband, the dignified Judge Manville.

At the pier, an elegantly dressed Annie tearfully reunites with Louise. A group of Annie&#x27;s friends from the streets are watching from a distance. One of the street people says that she can remember when Annie “always looked like that.” (We never know the details of Annie&#x27;s history, but her upper-crust origins are clear.) When three society reporters become suspicious about Mrs. E. Worthington Manville, of whom they can find no public records, they are kidnapped by members of Dave&#x27;s gang, and their prolonged disappearance leads the local newspapers to accuse the police department of incompetence.

A few days later, Blake – in the role of Judge Manville – announces he is planning a gala reception for Louise, Carlos, and Count Romero before they return to Spain, and he enlists Dave&#x27;s guys and Missouri&#x27;s dolls to pose as Annie&#x27;s society friends. On the night of the reception, the police – certain Dave is responsible for the missing reporters – surround Missouri&#x27;s club, where the gang has assembled for a final rehearsal. Dave calls Blake to advise him of their predicament, and Annie decides to confess everything to Count Romero. But fate – in the form of a sympathetic mayor and governor and their entourages – unexpectedly steps in and allows Annie to maintain her charade and keep Louise from learning the truth before she sails back to Spain with her husband-to-be.

==Production==
Damon Runyon&#x27;s short story &quot;Madame La Gimp&quot; was published in the October 1929 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. Columbia Pictures purchased the screen rights in September 1932, and the studio scheduled the production to begin the following May, although director Frank Capra had misgivings about the project. He reminded studio head Harry Cohn he was &quot;spending three hundred thousand dollars on a picture in which the heroine is seventy years old,&quot; to which Cohn responded, &quot;All I know is the thing&#x27;s got a wallop. Go ahead.&quot; Robert Riskin was assigned to develop the story for the screen and wrote four drafts, submitting the last on May 6, 1933, three days before principal photography began. Aside from some minor revisions made during production, this final script was filmed intact. Riskin&#x27;s version deviated from the original Runyon story primarily in that it linked its central character and a number of plot developments to the millions of Americans who were suffering as a result of the Great Depression. Runyon was pleased with the changes and later said, &quot;&quot;Lady for a Day&quot; was no more my picture than &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot;, which, like the former picture, was almost entirely the result of the genius of the scenario writers and the director who worked on it.&quot;

Riskin had written his screenplay specifically for Robert Montgomery, but MGM refused to loan him to Columbia. He was among several performers Capra wanted but failed to secure for roles in the film. With Montgomery unavailable, Capra approached James Cagney and William Powell, but Warner Bros. refused to loan them out to work on this project. Capra&#x27;s first choices for Apple Annie and Henry D. Blake, Marie Dressler and W.C. Fields, could not be cast for the same reason. The director finally cast his film with an assortment of character actors under contract (mostly from Warner Bros.) to Columbia. He also went to the Downtown Los Angeles neighborhood where he had sold newspapers as a boy and hired some of the street people who congregated there as extras who would add color to the film. One week before filming began, Capra offered the role of Apple Annie to 75-year-old May Robson, most of whose career had been spent performing on stage. In later years, Capra thought the fact she and most of the supporting players were unfamiliar to movie audiences helped the public accept them as the down-on-their-luck characters they were meant to be.

Just prior to the first preview in Hollywood in early July 1933, the film&#x27;s title was changed from &quot;Madame La Gimp&quot; to &quot;Beggars&#x27; Holiday&quot;, then changed again before the film premiered at Radio City Music Hall on September 7. It went into general release on September 13 and within a very short time earned $600,000, twice its budget and a substantial sum for the period. According to the contract he had negotiated prior to making the film, Capra received 10% of the net profits. The film&#x27;s success prompted the making of the 1934 film &quot;Lady by Choice&quot;, directed by David Burton and starring Carole Lombard. The only thing the two films have in common is Robson playing an alcoholic panhandler who has seen better days.

In the early 1950s, the original negative was lost while being transferred from one film lab to another for preservation work. For a period of time the only existing copy was a 35mm print owned by Capra, until he made a duplicate negative from it and donated a newly minted print to the Library of Congress. Columbia later sold the rights to the story to United Artists for $200,000, and Capra remade the film as &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; with Bette Davis and Glenn Ford in 1961. The director claimed to prefer the remake to the original, although most critics and, in later years film historians and movie buffs, disagreed with his assessment.

The &quot;Apple Annie&quot; story transformed into Capra&#x27;s &quot;Lady For A Day&quot; (and &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot;) has long been considered a natural source for a stage musical and a number of prominent writers, including Jerry Herman, David Shire and Richard Maltby Jr; the team of John Kander and Fred Ebb have all worked on unfinished and unrealized adaptations.

==Critical reception==
Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a merry tale with touches of sentiment, a picture which evoked laughter and tears from an audience at the first showing.&quot; He added, &quot;Its plausibility may be open to argument, but its entertainment value is not to be denied. It has aspects of Barrie&#x27;s &quot;The Old Lady Shows Her Medals&quot; and also more than a mere suggestion of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, set forth, as might be anticipated, in a more popular vein.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; said the film &quot;asks the spectator to believe in the improbable. It&#x27;s Hans Christian Andersen stuff written by a hard-boiled journalist and transferred to the screen by trick-wise Hollywoodites. While not stinting a full measure of credit to director Frank Capra, it seems as if the spotlight of recognition ought to play rather strongly on scriptwriter Robert Riskin.&quot;

Channel 4 calls it &quot;wonderfully improbable and charming&quot; and, although &quot;not a bona fide Capra classic,&quot; it is &quot;cracking fun all the same.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Lady for a Day&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture but lost to &quot;Cavalcade&quot;. May Robson was nominated Best Actress but lost to Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, and Robert Riskin lost the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay to Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman for &quot;Little Women&quot;.

Will Rogers presented the Academy Award for Best Director, and when he opened the envelope he simply announced, &quot;Come up and get it, Frank!&quot; Capra, certain he was the winner, ran to the podium to collect his Oscar, only to discover Rogers had meant Frank Lloyd, who won for &quot;Cavalcade&quot;, instead. Possibly to downplay Capra&#x27;s gaffe, Rogers then called third nominee George Cukor to join the two Franks on stage.

==Home media==
Image Entertainment released the film on Region 1 DVD on October 23, 2001, and on Blu-ray on March 20, 2012. Both editions include commentary by Frank Capra Jr., as well as his brief introduction to the 2001 restoration work. The Blu-ray edition additionally incorporates about four and a half minutes of lost footage, including a key scene where Dave, Blake and McGuire are planning the reception.
