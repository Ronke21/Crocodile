<text>Geography is an important factor in informing Iran&#x27;s foreign policy. Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the newly formed Islamic Republic, under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini, dramatically reversed the pro-American foreign policy of the last Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Since the country&#x27;s policies then oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour to eliminate non-Muslim Western influences while promoting the Islamic revolution abroad, and pragmatism, which would advance economic development and normalization of relations, bilateral dealings can be confused and contradictory.

According to data published by the Reputation Institute, Iran is the world&#x27;s second least internationally reputable country, just ahead of Iraq, and has held that position for the three consecutive years of 2016, 2017, and 2018. Islamism and nuclear proliferation are recurring issues with Iran&#x27;s foreign relations. In a series of international polls by Pew Research in 2012, only one country (Pakistan) had the majority of its population supporting Iran&#x27;s right to acquire nuclear arms; every other population polled overwhelmingly rejected a nuclear-armed Iran (90–95% opposed in the polled European, North American, and South American countries), and majorities in most of them were in favor of military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran from materializing. Additionally, the majority of Americans, Brazilians, Japanese, Mexicans, Egyptians, Germans, Britons, French, Italians, Spaniards, and Poles (among other national groups) had majority support for &quot;tougher sanctions&quot; on Iran, while majorities in China, Russia, and Turkey opposed tougher sanctions.

==Background==
Iranians have traditionally been highly sensitive to foreign interference in their country, pointing to such events as the Russian conquest of northern parts of the country in the course of the 19th century, the tobacco concession, the British and Russian occupations of the First and Second World Wars, and the CIA plot to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq. This suspicion manifests itself in attitudes that many foreigners might find incomprehensible, such as the &quot;fairly common&quot; belief that the Iranian Revolution was actually the work of a conspiracy between Iran&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a clergy and the British government. This may have been a result of the anti-Shah bias in BBC Radio&#x27;s influential Persian broadcasts into Iran: a BBC report of 23 March 2009 explains that many in Iran saw the broadcaster and the government as one, and interpreted the bias for Khomeini as evidence of weakening British government support for the Shah. It is entirely plausible that the BBC did indeed help hasten revolutionary events.

==Revolutionary period under Khomeini==
Under Khomeini&#x27;s government, Iran&#x27;s foreign policy often emphasized the elimination of foreign influence and the spread of Islamic revolution over state-to-state relations or the furtherance of trade. In Khomeini&#x27;s own words:

We shall export our revolution to the whole world. Until the cry &quot;There is no God but Allah&quot; resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.

The Islamic Republic&#x27;s effort to spread the revolution is considered to have begun in earnest in March 1982, when 380 men from more than 25 Arab and Islamic nations met at the former Tehran Hilton Hotel for a &quot;seminar&quot; on the &quot;ideal Islamic government&quot; and, less academically, the launch of a large-scale offensive to cleanse the Islamic world of the satanic Western and Communist influences that were seen to be hindering the Islamic world&#x27;s progress. The gathering of militants, primarily Shi&#x27;a but including some Sunnis, &quot;with various religious and revolutionary credentials&quot;, was hosted by the Association of Militant Clerics and the Pasdaran Islamic Revolutionary Guards. The nerve centre of the revolutionary crusade, operational since shortly after the 1979 revolution, was located in downtown Tehran and known to outsiders as the &quot;Taleghani Centre&quot;. Here the groundwork for the gathering was prepared: the establishment of Arab cadres, recruited or imported from surrounding countries to spread the revolution, and provision of headquarters for such groups as the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the Iraqi Shi&#x27;a movement, and Philippine Moro, Kuwaiti, Saudi, North African and Lebanese militant clerics.

These groups came under the umbrella of the &quot;Council for the Islamic Revolution&quot;, which was supervised by Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the designated heir of Ayatollah Khomeini. Most of the council&#x27;s members were clerics, but they also reportedly included advisors from the Syrian and Libyan intelligence agencies. The council apparently received more than $1 billion annually in contributions from the faithful in other countries and in funds allocated by the Iranian government.

Its strategy was two-pronged: armed struggle against what were perceived as Western imperialism and its agents; and an internal purifying process to free Islamic territory and Muslim minds of non-Islamic cultural, intellectual and spiritual influences, by providing justice, services, resources to the &quot;mustazafin&quot; (weak) masses of the Muslim world. These attempts to spread its Islamic revolution strained the country&#x27;s relations with many of its Arab neighbours, and the extrajudicial execution of Iranian dissidents in Europe unnerved European nations, particularly France and Germany. For example, the Islamic Republic expressed its opinion of Egypt&#x27;s secular government by naming a street in Tehran after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat&#x27;s killer, Khalid al-Istanbuli. At this time Iran found itself very isolated, but this was a secondary consideration to the spread of revolutionary ideals across the Persian Gulf and confrontation with the US (or &quot;Great Satan&quot;) in the 1979-1981 hostage crisis.

===Training volunteers===
Arab and other Muslim volunteers who came to Iran were trained in camps run by the Revolutionary Guards. There were three primary bases in Tehran, and others in Ahvaz, Isfahan, Qom, Shiraz, and Mashhad, and a further facility, converted in 1984, near the southern naval base at Bushire.

In 1981 Iran supported an attempt to overthrow the Bahraini government, in 1983 expressed political support for Shi&#x27;ites who bombed Western embassies in Kuwait, and in 1987 Iranian pilgrims rioted at poor living conditions and treatment during the Hajj (pilgrimage) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and were consequently massacred. Nations with strong fundamentalist movements, such as Egypt and Algeria, also began to mistrust Iran. With the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Iran was thought to be supporting the creation of the Hizballah organization. Furthermore, Iran went on to oppose the Arab–Israeli peace process, because it saw Israel as an illegal country.

===Iran–Iraq War===

Iranian relations with Iraq have never been good. They took a turn for the worse in 1980 when Iraq invaded Iran. The stated reason for Iraq&#x27;s invasion was the contested sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway (&quot;Arvand Rud&quot; in Persian). Other unstated reasons were probably more significant: Iran and Iraq had a history of interference in each other&#x27;s affairs by supporting separatist movements, and although this interference had ceased since the Algiers Agreement.

Iran demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iranian territory and the return to the &quot;status quo ante&quot; for the Shatt al-Arab, as established under the Algiers Agreement. This period saw Iran become even more isolated, with virtually no allies. Exhausted by the war, Iran signed UN Security Council Resolution 598 in July 1988, after the United States and Germany began supplying Iraq with chemical weapons. The ceasefire resulting from the UN resolution was implemented on 20 August 1988. Neither nation had made any real gains in the war, which left one million dead and had a dramatic effect on the country&#x27;s foreign policy. From this point on, the Islamic Republic recognized that it had no choice but to moderate its radical approach and rationalize its objectives. This was the beginning of what Anoushiravan Ehteshami calls the &quot;reorientation phase&quot; of Iranian foreign policy.

===Pragmatism===
Like other revolutionary states, practical considerations have sometimes led the Islamic Republic to inconsistency and subordination of such ideological concerns as pan-Islamic solidarity. One observer, Graham Fuller, has called the Islamic Republic &quot;stunningly silent&quot;
about [Muslim] Chechens in [non-Muslim] Russia, or Uyghurs in China, simply because the Iranian state has important strategic ties with both China and Russia that need to be preserved in the state interest. Iran has astonishingly even supported Christian Armenia in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War against Shi&#x27;ite Azerbaijan and has been careful not to lend too much support to Islamic Tajiks in Tajikistan, where the language is basically a dialect of Persian. In this regard the Islamic Republic resembles another revolutionary state, the old Soviet Union. The USSR was ideologically committed not to Islam but to world proletarian revolution, led by Communist parties under its leadership, but &quot;frequently abandoned support to foreign communist parties when it served Soviet national interests to cooperate with the governments that were oppressing them.&quot;

===Post-War period (1988–present)===
Since the end of the Iran–Iraq War, Iran&#x27;s new foreign policy has had a dramatic effect on its global standing. Relations with the European Union have dramatically improved, to the point where Iran is a major oil exporter and a trading partner with such countries as Italy, France, and Germany. China and India have also emerged as friends of Iran; these three countries face similar challenges in the global economy as they industrialize, and consequently find themselves aligned on a number of issues.

Iran maintains regular diplomatic and commercial relations with Russia and the former Soviet Republics. Both Iran and Russia believe they have important national interests at stake in developments in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus, particularly concerning energy resources from the Caspian Sea.

===Significant historical treaties===
* Treaty of Zuhab by which Iran irrevocably lost Mesopotamia (Iraq) to the Ottomans. Roughly settled the modern-day Iran-Iraq-Turkey borders
* Treaty of Gulistan 1813, by which Iran irrevocably lost Georgia, Dagestan, and most of Azerbaijan.
* Treaty of Turkmenchay 1828, by which Iran irrevocably lost Armenia and the remainder of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan (comprising the Lankaran and Nakchivan khanates.
* Treaty of Akhal
* Treaty of Paris (1857) (by which Iran renounced claims over Herat and parts of Afghanistan)
* Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907

==Current policies==
The Islamic Republic of Iran accords priority to its relations with the other states in the region and with the rest of the Islamic world. This includes a strong commitment to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Non-Aligned Movement. Relations with the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), especially with Saudi Arabia, are characterized by rivalry and hostility. An unresolved territorial dispute with the United Arab Emirates concerning three islands in the Persian Gulf continues to mar its relations with these states. Iran has close relations with Kuwait.

Iran seeks new allies around the world due to its increasing political and economic isolation in the international community. This isolation is evident in the various economic sanctions and the EU oil embargo that have been implemented in response to questions that have been raised over the Iranian nuclear program.

Tehran supports the Interim Governing Council in Iraq, but it strongly advocates a prompt and full transfer of state authority to the Iraqi people. Iran hopes for stabilization in Afghanistan and supports the reconstruction effort so that the Afghan refugees in Iran (which number approximately 2.5 million.) can return to their homeland and the flow of drugs from Afghanistan can be stemmed. Iran is also pursuing a policy of stabilization and cooperation with the countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, whereby it is seeking to capitalise on its central location to establish itself as the political and economic hub of the region.

On the international scene, it has been argued by some that Iran has become, or will become in the near future, a superpower due to its ability to influence international events. Others, such as Robert Baer, have argued that Iran is already an energy superpower and is on its way to becoming an empire. Flynt Leverett calls Iran a rising power that might well become a nuclear power in coming years—if the US does not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear technology, as part of a grand bargain under which Iran would cease its nuclear activities in exchange for a guarantee of its borders by the US.

===Territorial disputes===

* Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990, but they are still trying to work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border demarcation, prisoners of war, and freedom of navigation in and sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway.
* Iran governs and possesses two islands in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE: Lesser Tunb (which the UAE calls &quot;Tunb as Sughra&quot; in Arabic, and Iran calls &quot;Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Kuchek&quot; in Persian) and Greater Tunb (Arabic &quot;Tunb al Kubra&quot;, Persian &quot;Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg&quot;).
* Iran jointly administers with the UAE an island in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE (Arabic &quot;Abu Musa&quot;, Persian, &quot;Jazireh-ye Abu Musa&quot;), over which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control since 1992, including access restrictions.
* The Caspian Sea borders between Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkmenistan are not yet determined, although this problem is set to be resolved peacefully in the coming years through slow negotiations. After the breakup of the USSR, the newly independent republics bordering the Caspian Sea claimed shares of territorial waters and the seabed, thus unilaterally abrogating the existing half-and-half USSR-Iran agreements which, like all other Soviet treaties, the republics had agreed to respect upon their independence. It has been suggested by these countries that the Caspian Sea should be divided in proportion to each bordering country&#x27;s shoreline, in which case Iran&#x27;s share would be reduced to about 13%. The Iranian side has expressed eagerness to know if this means that all Irano–Russian and –Soviet agreements are void, entitling Iran to claim territorial sovereignty over lands lost to Russia by treaties that the parties still consider &quot;vivant&quot;. Issues between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan were settled in 2003, but Iran does not recognize these agreements, on the premise that the international law governing open water can not be applied to the Caspian Sea, which is in fact a lake (a landlocked body of water). Iran has not pressed its Caspian territorial claims in recent years because it relies heavily on Russia&#x27;s support in its nuclear-development battle with the West.

===Africa===
In 2009, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said that if Iran and Africa works together, both can largely meet each other’s interest. Some signs of disillusionment began to emerge when 20 African nations threatened to close their embassies in Tehran following what they saw as Ahmadinejad&#x27;s failure to live up to the promises he made during his trips to Africa. The Iranian government was not deterred by the misadventures, and some think it considers African countries strategically necessary to enable it to receive international support for its much criticized nuclear program.

===Americas===
Trade between Iran and Brazil quadrupled between 2002 and 2007, and it will further increase as much as fivefold, from $2 billion to $10 billion annually. In addition to Brazil, Iran has signed dozens of economic agreements with Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, Iran and Venezuela have agreed to invest $350 million in building a deepwater seaport off the Caribbean coast, in addition to a cross-country system of pipelines, rails and highways. Iranian firms are also planning to build two cement factories in Bolivia. Other developments include the agreement reached with Ecuador to build a cement factory as well as several other industrial cooperation MoUs (2008). In the four years after Ahmadinejad ascended to the Iranian presidency in 2005, Iran opened six new embassies in Latin America. The new embassies are located in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Uruguay - in addition to the five already in operation in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela.

<text>Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky (; ; – ) was a Russian composer, one of the group known as &quot;The Five.&quot; He was an innovator of Russian music in the Romantic period and strove to achieve a uniquely Russian musical identity, often in deliberate defiance of the established conventions of Western music.

Many of Mussorgsky&#x27;s works were inspired by Russian history, Russian folklore, and other national themes. Such works include the opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, the orchestral tone poem &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; and the piano suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;.

For many years, Mussorgsky&#x27;s works were mainly known in versions revised or completed by other composers. Many of his most important compositions have posthumously come into their own in their original forms, and some of the original scores are now also available.

==Name==
The spelling and pronunciation of the composer&#x27;s name have caused some confusion.

The family name derives from a 15th- or 16th-century ancestor, Roman Vasilyevich Monastyryov, who appears in the Velvet Book, the 17th-century genealogy of Russian boyars. Roman Vasilyevich bore the nickname &quot;Musorga&quot; (from , meaning &quot;music maker&quot;), and was the grandfather of the first Mussorgsky. The composer could trace his lineage to Rurik, the legendary ninth-century founder of the Rus state.

In Mussorgsky family documents, the spelling of the name varies: &quot;Musarskiy&quot;, &quot;Muserskiy&quot;, &quot;Muserskoy&quot;, &quot;Musirskoy&quot;, &quot;Musorskiy&quot;, and &quot;Musurskiy&quot;. The baptismal record gives the composer&#x27;s name as &quot;Muserskiy&quot;.

In early (up to 1858) letters to Mily Balakirev, the composer signed his name &quot;Musorskiy&quot; (). The &quot;g&quot; made its first appearance in a letter to Balakirev in 1863. Mussorgsky used this new spelling (, &quot;Musorgskiy&quot;) to the end of his life, but occasionally reverted to the earlier &quot;Musorskiy&quot;. The addition of the &quot;g&quot; to the name was likely initiated by the composer&#x27;s elder brother Filaret to obscure the resemblance of the name&#x27;s root to an unsavory Russian word:

:&quot;мусoр&quot; (músor) — &quot;n. m.&quot; debris, rubbish, refuse

Mussorgsky apparently did not take the new spelling seriously and played on the &quot;rubbish&quot; connection in letters to Vladimir Stasov and to Stasov&#x27;s family, routinely signing his name &quot;Musoryanin&quot;, roughly &quot;garbage-dweller&quot; (compare &quot;dvoryanin&quot;: &quot;nobleman&quot;).

The first syllable of the name originally received the stress (i.e., MÚS-ər-skiy), and does so to this day in Russia, including the composer&#x27;s home district. The mutability of the second-syllable vowel in the versions of the name mentioned above gives evidence that this syllable did not receive the stress.

The addition of the &quot;g&quot; and the accompanying shift in stress to the second syllable (i.e., Mu-SÓRK-skiy), sometimes described as a Polish variant, was supported by Filaret Mussorgsky&#x27;s descendants until his line ended in the 20th century. Their example was followed by many influential Russians, such as Fyodor Shalyapin, Nikolay Golovanov, and Tikhon Khrennikov, who, perhaps dismayed that the great composer&#x27;s name was &quot;reminiscent of garbage&quot;, supported the erroneous second-syllable stress that has also become entrenched in the West.

The Western convention of doubling the first &quot;s&quot;, which is not observed in scholarly literature (e.g., &quot;The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;), likely arose because in many Western European languages a single intervocalic /s/ often becomes voiced to /z/ (as in &quot;music&quot;), unlike in Slavic languages where the intervocalic /s/ is always unvoiced. Doubling the consonant thus reinforces its voiceless sibilant /s/ sound.

&quot;Modest&quot; is the Russian form of the name &quot;Modestus&quot; which means &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;restrained&quot; in Late Latin. He was called &quot;Modinka&quot; (), diminutive form with the stressed O, by his close friends and relatives.

==Life==

===Early years===

Mussorgsky was born in Karevo, Toropets Uyezd, Pskov Governorate, Russian Empire, south of Saint Petersburg. His wealthy and land-owning family, the noble family of Mussorgsky, is reputedly descended from the first Ruthenian ruler, Rurik, through the sovereign princes of Smolensk. His mother, Julia Chirikova, was the daughter of a comparatively non-rich nobleman. Modest&#x27;s paternal grandmother Irina used to be a serf that could be sold without land in his grandfather&#x27;s estate. At age six, Mussorgsky began receiving piano lessons from his mother, herself a trained pianist. His progress was sufficiently rapid that three years later, he was able to perform a John Field concerto and works by Franz Liszt for family and friends. At age 10, Mussorgsky and his brother were taken to Saint Petersburg to study at the elite German language Petrischule (St. Peter&#x27;s School). While there, Modest studied the piano with . In 1852, the 12-year-old Mussorgsky published a piano piece titled &quot;Porte-enseigne Polka&quot; at his father&#x27;s expense.

Mussorgsky&#x27;s parents planned the move to Saint Petersburg so that both their sons would renew the family tradition of military service. Mussorgsky entered the Cadet School of the Guards at age 13. Controversy had arisen over the educational attitudes at the time of both this institute and its director, a General Sutgof. All agreed the Cadet School could be a brutal place, especially for new recruits. More tellingly for Mussorgsky, it was likely where he began his eventual path to alcoholism. According to a former student, singer and composer Nikolai Kompaneisky, Sutgof &quot;was proud when a cadet returned from leave drunk with champagne.&quot;

Music still remained important to Mussorgsky. Sutgof&#x27;s daughter was also a pupil of Gerke, and Mussorgsky was allowed to attend lessons with her. His skills as a pianist made him much in demand by fellow-cadets; for them he would play dances interspersed with his own improvisations. In 1856, Mussorgsky – who had developed a strong interest in history and studied German philosophy – graduated from the Cadet School. Following family tradition, he received a commission with the Preobrazhensky Regiment, the foremost regiment of the Russian Imperial Guard.

=== Maturity ===
In October 1856, the 17-year-old Mussorgsky met the 22-year-old Alexander Borodin while both men served at a military hospital in Saint Petersburg. The two were soon on good terms. Borodin later remembered,


More portentous was Mussorgsky&#x27;s introduction that winter to Alexander Dargomyzhsky, at that time the most important Russian composer after Mikhail Glinka. Dargomyzhsky was impressed with Mussorgsky&#x27;s pianism. As a result, Mussorgsky became a fixture at Dargomyzhsky&#x27;s soirées. There, as critic Vladimir Stasov later recalled, he began &quot;his true musical life.&quot;

Over the next two years at Dargomyzhsky&#x27;s, Mussorgsky met several figures of importance in Russia&#x27;s cultural life, among them Stasov, César Cui (a fellow officer), and Mily Balakirev. Balakirev had an especially strong impact. Within days he took it upon himself to help shape Mussorgsky&#x27;s fate as a composer. He recalled to Stasov, &quot;Because I am not a theorist, I could not teach him harmony (as, for instance Rimsky-Korsakov now teaches it) ... [but] I explained to him the form of compositions, and to do this we played through both Beethoven symphonies [as piano duets] and much else (Schumann, Schubert, Glinka, and others), analyzing the form.&quot; Up to this point, Mussorgsky had known nothing but piano music; his knowledge of more radical recent music was virtually non-existent. Balakirev started filling these gaps in Mussorgsky&#x27;s knowledge.

In 1858, within a few months of beginning his studies with Balakirev, Mussorgsky resigned his commission to devote himself entirely to music. He also suffered a painful crisis at this time. This may have had a spiritual component (in a letter to Balakirev the young man referred to &quot;mysticism and cynical thoughts about the Deity&quot;), but its exact nature will probably never be known. In 1859, the 20-year-old gained valuable theatrical experience by assisting in a production of Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; on the Glebovo estate of a former singer and her wealthy husband; Mussorgsky also met (father of Anatoly Lyadov) and enjoyed a formative visit to Moscow – after which he professed love of &quot;everything Russian&quot;. Mussorgsky and his brother were also inspired by the gothic script, they were using an &quot;M&quot; personal sign instead of family coat of arms, very similar to the symbols of the early Rurikids.

 Despite this epiphany, Mussorgsky&#x27;s music leaned more toward foreign models; a four-hand piano sonata that he produced in 1860 contains his only movement in sonata form. Nor is any &#x27;nationalistic&#x27; impulse easily discernible in the incidental music for Vladislav Ozerov&#x27;s play &quot;Oedipus in Athens&quot;, on which he worked between the ages of 19 and 22 (and then abandoned unfinished), or in the &quot;Intermezzo in Modo Classico&quot; for piano solo (revised and orchestrated in 1867). The latter was the only important piece he composed between December 1860 and August 1863: the reasons for this probably lie in the painful re-emergence of his subjective crisis in 1860 and the purely objective difficulties which resulted from the emancipation of the serfs the following year – as a result of which the family was deprived of half its estate, and Mussorgsky had to spend a good deal of time in Karevo unsuccessfully attempting to stave off their looming impoverishment.

By this time, Mussorgsky had freed himself from the influence of Balakirev and was largely teaching himself. In 1863 he began an opera – &quot;Salammbô&quot; – on which he worked between 1863 and 1866 before losing interest in the project. During this period, he returned to Saint Petersburg and supported himself as a low-grade civil servant while living in a six-man &quot;commune&quot;. In a heady artistic and intellectual atmosphere, he read and discussed a wide range of modern artistic and scientific ideas – including those of the provocative writer Chernyshevsky, known for the bold assertion that, in art, &quot;form and content are opposites&quot;. Under such influences he came more and more to embrace the idea of artistic realism and all that it entailed, whether this concerned the responsibility to depict life &quot;as it is truly lived&quot;; the preoccupation with the lower strata of society; or the rejection of repeating, symmetrical musical forms as insufficiently true to the unrepeating, unpredictable course of &quot;real life&quot;.
&quot;Real life&quot; affected Mussorgsky painfully in 1865 when his mother died; at this point, the composer had his first serious bout of alcoholism, which forced him to leave the commune to stay with his brother. However, the 26-year-old was on the point of writing his first realistic songs (including &quot;Hopak&quot; and &quot;Darling Savishna&quot;, both of them composed in 1866 and among his first &quot;real&quot; publications the following year). The year 1867 was also the one in which he finished the original orchestral version of his &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; (which, Balakirev criticised and refused to conduct, with the result that it was never performed during Mussorgsky&#x27;s lifetime).

===Peak===

Mussorgsky&#x27;s career as a civil servant was by no means stable or secure: though he was assigned to various posts and even received a promotion in these early years, Mussorgsky was declared &quot;supernumerary&quot; in 1867 – remaining &quot;in service&quot; but receiving no wages. However, decisive developments were occurring in his artistic life. Although it was in 1867 that Stasov first referred to the &quot;kuchka&quot; (, lit. &quot;bunch&quot;, English: &quot;The Five&quot;) of Russian composers loosely grouped around Balakirev, Mussorgsky was by then ceasing to seek Balakirev&#x27;s approval and was moving closer to the older Alexander Dargomyzhsky. Inside &quot;The Five&quot; and its close companions, Mussorgsky was nicknamed as &quot;Humour&quot;, Balakirev was &quot;Power&quot;, and Rimsky-Korsakov was &quot;Sincerity&quot;.

Since 1866, Dargomyzhsky had been working on his opera &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;, a version of the &quot;Don Juan&quot; story with a Pushkin text that he declared would be set &quot;just as it stands, so that the inner truth of the text should not be distorted&quot;, and in a manner that abolished the &quot;unrealistic&quot; division between aria and recitative in favor of a continuous mode of syllabic but lyrically heightened declamation somewhere between the two.

Under the influence of this work (and the ideas of Georg Gottfried Gervinus, according to whom &quot;the highest natural object of musical imitation is emotion, and the method of imitating emotion is to mimic speech&quot;), Mussorgsky in 1868 rapidly set the first eleven scenes of Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s play &quot;Marriage&quot; (&quot;Zhenitba&quot;), with his priority being to render into music the natural accents and patterns of the play&#x27;s naturalistic and deliberately humdrum dialogue. This work marked an extreme position in Mussorgsky&#x27;s pursuit of naturalistic word-setting: he abandoned it unorchestrated after reaching the end of his &quot;Act 1&quot;, and though its characteristically &quot;Mussorgskyian&quot; declamation is to be heard in all his later vocal music, the naturalistic mode of vocal writing more and more became merely one expressive element among many.

A few months after abandoning &quot;Zhenitba&quot;, the 29-year-old Mussorgsky was encouraged to write an opera on the story of Boris Godunov. This he did, assembling and shaping a text from Pushkin&#x27;s play and Karamzin&#x27;s history. Mussorgsky completed the large-scale score the following year while living with friends and working for the Forestry Department. However, the finished opera was rejected for theatrical performance in 1871, apparently because of its lack of any &quot;prima donna&quot; role. Mussorgsky set to work producing a revised and enlarged &quot;second version&quot;. During the next year, which he spent sharing rooms with Rimsky-Korsakov, he made changes that went beyond those requested by the theatre. In this version the opera was accepted, probably in May 1872, and three excerpts were staged at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1873. It is often asserted that in 1872 the opera was rejected a second time, but no specific evidence for this exists.

By the time of the first production of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in February 1874, Mussorgsky had taken part in the ill-fated &quot;Mlada&quot; project (in the course of which he had made a choral version of his &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;) and had begun &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;. Though far from being a critical success – and in spite of receiving only a dozen or so performances – the popular reaction in favour of &quot;Boris&quot; made this the peak of Mussorgsky&#x27;s career.

===Decline===
From this peak, a pattern of decline became increasingly apparent. At this point, the Balakirev circle was disintegrating, something Mussorgsky was especially bitter about. He wrote to Vladimir Stasov, &quot;[T]he Mighty Handful has degenerated into soulless traitors.&quot; In drifting away from his old friends, Mussorgsky had been seen to fall victim to &quot;fits of madness&quot; that could well have been alcoholism-related. His friend Viktor Hartmann had died, and his relative and recent roommate Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov (who furnished the poems for the song-cycle &quot;Sunless&quot; and would go on to provide those for the &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot;) had moved away to get married. Mussorgsky engaged a new and prominent personal private physician about 1870, Dr. George Leon Carrick, sometime Secretary and later President of the St. Petersburg Physicians&#x27; Society and a cousin of Sir Harry Lauder.
While Mussorgsky suffered personally from alcoholism, it was also a behavior pattern considered typical for those of Mussorgsky&#x27;s generation who wanted to oppose the establishment and protest through extreme forms of behavior. One contemporary noted, &quot;an intense worship of Bacchus was considered to be almost obligatory for a writer of that period. It was a showing off, a &#x27;pose,&#x27; for the best people of the [eighteen-]sixties.&quot; Another writes, &quot;Talented people in Russia who love the simple folk cannot but drink.&quot; Mussorgsky spent day and night in a Saint Petersburg tavern of low repute, the Maly Yaroslavets, accompanied by other bohemian dropouts. He and his fellow drinkers idealized their alcoholism, perhaps seeing it as ethical and aesthetic opposition.
For a time, Mussorgsky was able to maintain his creative output: his compositions from 1874 include &quot;Sunless&quot;, the &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; Prelude, and the piano suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; (in memory of Hartmann); Mussorgsky also began working on another opera based on Gogol, &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot; (for which he produced another choral version of &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;).

In the years that followed, Mussorgsky&#x27;s decline became increasingly steep. Although now part of a new circle of eminent personages that included singers, medical men, and actors, he was increasingly unable to resist drinking, and a succession of deaths among his closest associates caused him great pain. However, Mussorgsky&#x27;s alcoholism would seem to be in check at times, and among the most powerful works composed during his last six years are the four &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot;. Mussorgsky&#x27;s civil service career was made more precarious by his frequent &quot;illnesses&quot; and absences, and Mussorgsky was fortunate to obtain a transfer to a post (in the Office of Government Control), where his music-loving superior treated him with great leniency – even allowing Mussorgsky to spend three months touring 12 cities as a singer&#x27;s accompanist in 1879.

However, the decline could not be halted. In 1880, Mussorgsky was finally dismissed from government service. Aware of his destitution, one group of friends organized a stipend designed to support the completion of &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; while another group organized a similar fund to pay him to complete &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot;, but neither work was completed (although &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;, in piano score with only two numbers uncomposed, came close to being finished).

In early 1881, a desperate Mussorgsky declared to a friend that there was &quot;nothing left but begging&quot; and suffered four seizures in rapid succession. Mussorgsky also suffered from delirium tremens during this period. Although he found a comfortable room in a good hospital – and for several weeks even appeared to be rallying – the situation was hopeless. In March 1881, Ilya Repin painted the famous, red-nosed portrait in what were to be the last days of the composer&#x27;s life as Mussorgsky died a week after his 42nd birthday. Mussorgsky was interred at the Tikhvin Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg.

Mussorgsky, like others of &quot;The Five&quot;, was perceived as an extremist by the emperor and much of his court. This may have been the reason Tsar Alexander III personally crossed off &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; from the list of proposed pieces for the Imperial Opera in 1888.

==Works==
Mussorgsky&#x27;s works, while strikingly novel, are stylistically Romantic and draw heavily on Russian musical themes. He has been the inspiration for many Russian composers, including most notably Dmitri Shostakovich (in his late symphonies) and Sergei Prokofiev (in his operas).

In 1868 or 1869, Mussorgsky composed the opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, about the life of the Russian tsar, but it was rejected by the Mariinsky Opera. Mussorgsky thus edited the work, making a final version in 1874. The early version is considered darker and more concise than the later version, but also more crude. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov re-orchestrated the opera in 1896 and revised it in 1908. The opera has also been revised by other composers, notably Shostakovich, who made two versions, one for film and one for stage.

The opera &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; was unfinished and unperformed when Mussorgsky died, but it was completed by Rimsky-Korsakov and received its premiere in 1886 in Saint Petersburg. This opera was also revised by Shostakovich. &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot;, another opera, was left incomplete at his death but a dance excerpt, the Gopak, is frequently performed.

Mussorgsky&#x27;s most imaginative and frequently performed work is the cycle of piano pieces describing paintings in sound called &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;. This composition, best known through an orchestral arrangement by Maurice Ravel, was written in commemoration of his friend, the architect Viktor Hartmann.

Mussorgsky&#x27;s single-movement orchestral work &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; enjoyed broad popular recognition in the 1940s when it was featured, in tandem with Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, in the 1940 Walt Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

Among the composer&#x27;s other works are a number of songs, including three song cycles: &quot;The Nursery&quot; (1872), &quot;Sunless&quot; (1874) and &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot; (1877); plus &quot;Mephistopheles&#x27; Song of the Flea&quot; and many others. Important early recordings of songs by Mussorgsky were made by tenor Vladimir Rosing in the 1920s and 1930s. Other recordings have been made by Boris Christoff between 1951 and 1957 and by Sergei Leiferkus in 1993.

==Reputation==
Contemporary opinions of Mussorgsky as a composer and person varied from positive to ambiguous to negative. Mussorgsky&#x27;s eventual supporters, Vladimir Stasov and Mily Balakirev, initially registered strongly negative impressions of the composer. Stasov wrote to Balakirev, in an 1863 letter, &quot;I have no use for Mussorgsky. His views may tally with mine, but I have never heard him express an intelligent idea. All in him is flabby, dull. He is, it seems to me, a thorough idiot&quot;, and Balakirev agreed: &quot;Yes, Mussorgsky is little short of an idiot.&quot;

Mixed impressions are recorded by Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky, colleagues of Mussorgsky who, unlike him, made their living as composers. Both praised his talent while expressing disappointment with his technique. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that Mussorgsky&#x27;s scores included:
While preparing an edition of &quot;Sorochintsï Fair&quot;, Anatoly Lyadov remarked: &quot;It is easy enough to correct Mussorgsky&#x27;s irregularities. The only trouble is that when this is done, the character and originality of the music are done away with, and the composer&#x27;s individuality vanishes.&quot;

Tchaikovsky, in a letter to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck, was also critical of Mussorgsky:
Western perceptions of Mussorgsky changed with the European premiere of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in 1908. Before the premiere, he was regarded as an eccentric in the West. Critic Edward Dannreuther, wrote, in the 1905 edition of &quot;The Oxford History of Music&quot;, &quot;Mussorgsky, in his vocal efforts, appears wilfully eccentric. His style impresses the Western ear as barbarously ugly.&quot; However, after the premiere, views on Mussorgsky&#x27;s music changed drastically. Gerald Abraham, a musicologist, and an authority on Mussorgsky: &quot;As a musical translator of words and all that can be expressed in words, of psychological states, and even physical movement, he is unsurpassed; as an absolute musician he was hopelessly limited, with remarkably little ability to construct pure music or even a purely musical texture.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Mussorgsky&#x27;s tone poem &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; was used in the 1940 animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, accompanied by an animation of Chernobog summoning evil spirits on a mountain. It segues into &quot;Ave Maria&quot; by Franz Schubert.

The progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer performed and recorded an arrangement of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; in 1971, featuring lyrics by Greg Lake, and released it as a live album of the same name.

The first 20 seconds of Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1995 song &quot;HIStory&quot; relies on an orchestrated version of &quot;The Bogatyr Gates (In the Capital in Kiev)&quot; fragment of &quot;The Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;.

The 2020 film &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga&quot; starring Dan Stevens as Alexander Lemtov, a flamboyant singer representing Russia, had a non-typical Russian character development as an obvious cultural reference to Modest Mussorgsky, also known domestically for encouraging a female opera singer to compose a classical song &quot;Letter After the Ball&quot;.

<doc id="64716" wikidata="Q131434" url="?curid=64716" title="Noricum">
<text>Noricum () is the Latin name for the kingdom or federation of tribes that included most of modern Austria and part of Slovenia. In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire. Its borders were the Danube to the north, Raetia and Vindelici to the west, Pannonia to the east and south-east, and Italia (Venetia et Histria) to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg.

==Area and population==
Around 800 BC, the region was inhabited mostly by the people of the Hallstatt culture. Around 450 BC, they merged with the people of other areas in the south-western regions of Germany and eastern France.

The country is mountainous and rich in iron and salt. It supplied material for the manufacturing of arms in Pannonia, Moesia, and northern Italy. The famous Noric steel was largely used in the making of Roman weapons (e.g. Horace, &quot;Odes&quot;, i.16.9-10: &quot;Noricus ensis&quot;, &quot;a Noric sword&quot;). Gold and salt were found in considerable quantities. The plant called saliunca (the wild nard, a relative of the lavender) grew in abundance and was used as a perfume according to Pliny the Elder.

The inhabitants developed a culture rich in art, salt mining, cattle breeding, and agriculture. When part of the area became a Roman province, the Romans introduced water management and the already important trade relations between the people north and south of the Alps increased.

Archaeological research, particularly in the cemeteries of Hallstatt, has shown that a vigorous civilization was in the area centuries before recorded history. The graves contained weapons and ornaments from the Bronze Age, through the period of transition, up to the Hallstatt culture, i.e., the fully developed older period of the Iron Age.

==Language==
The Noric language is attested in only fragmentary inscriptions, one from Ptuj and two from Grafenstein, neither of which provide enough information for any conclusions about the nature of the language.

==History==
===Steel for Roman weaponry===
The kingdom of Noricum was a major provider of weaponry for the Roman army from the mid-Republic onwards. Roman swords were made of the best-quality steel then available from this region, the &quot;chalybs Noricus&quot;. The strength of steel is determined by its composition and heat treatment. The wrought iron produced in the Greco-Roman world was too soft for tools and weapons. Ore from Noricum, by contrast, could yield a superior product. The ore needed to be rich in manganese (an element which remains essential in modern steelmaking processes), and contain little or no phosphorus, which weakens steel. The ore mined in Carinthia (S. Noricum) fulfilled both criteria particularly well. The Noricum discovered their ore made superior steel around 500 BC and built a major steel industry.

At Magdalensberg, a major production and trading centre, specialised blacksmiths crafted metal products and weapons. The finished arms were exported to Aquileia, a Roman colony founded in 180 BC.

From 200 BC, the Noricum tribes gradually united into a kingdom, known as the Regnum Noricum, with its capital at a place called Noreia. Noricum became a key ally of the Roman Republic, providing high-quality weapons and tools in exchange for military protection. This was demonstrated in 113 BC, when Teutones invaded Noricum. In response, the Roman consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo led an army over the Alps to attack the tribes at the Noreia.

===Roman rule===
Noricum was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 16 BC. For a long time previously, the Noricans had enjoyed independence under princes of their own and carried on commerce with the Romans. In 48 BC they took the side of Julius Caesar in the civil war against Pompey. In 16 BC, having joined with the Pannonians in invading Histria, they were defeated by Publius Silius Nerva, proconsul of Illyricum. Thereafter, Noricum became a Roman province. It was not until the reign of Antoninus Pius that the Second Legion, &quot;Pia&quot; (later renamed &quot;Italica&quot;) was stationed in Noricum, and the commander of the legion became the governor of the province.

Under Diocletian (245–313), Noricum was divided into &quot;Noricum ripense&quot; (&quot;Noricum along the river&quot;, the northern part southward from the Danube), and &quot;Noricum mediterraneum&quot; (&quot;landlocked Noricum&quot;, the southern, more mountainous district). The dividing line ran along the central part of the eastern Alps. Each division was under a praeses, and both belonged to the diocese of Illyricum in the Praetorian prefecture of Italy. It was in this time (304 AD) that a Christian serving as a military officer in the province suffered martyrdom for the sake of his faith, later canonised as Saint Florian.

The Roman colonies and chief towns were &quot;Virunum&quot; (near Maria Saal to the north of Klagenfurt), &quot;Teurnia&quot; (near Spittal an der Drau), &quot;Flavia Solva&quot; (near Leibnitz), &quot;Celeia&quot; (Celje) in today&#x27;s Slovenia, &quot;Juvavum&quot; (Salzburg), &quot;Ovilava&quot; (Wels), &quot;Lauriacum&quot; (Lorch at the mouth of the Enns, the ancient &quot;Anisus&quot;).

Knowledge of Roman Noricum has been decisively expanded by the work of Richard Knabl, an Austrian epigrapher of the 19th century.

The transition from Roman to barbarian rule in Noricum is well documented in Eugippius&#x27; &quot;Life of Saint Severinus&quot;, providing material for analogies for this process in other regions where primary sources from the period are lacking.

==In modern politics==
In 1919, Heinrich Lammasch, the last prime minister of Imperial Austria, proposed to give the young republic the name of &quot;Norische Republik&quot; or &quot;Noric Republic&quot;, because the ancient borders were similar to those of the new state, which—at the time—did not wish to be considered the heir of the Habsburg monarchy, but an independent, neutral and peaceful state.

<doc id="64719" wikidata="Q37693" url="?curid=64719" title="Paul Gauguin">
<text>Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin (; ; 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a French painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramist, and writer, whose work has been primarily associated with the Post-Impressionist and Symbolist movements. He was also an influential practitioner of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms. While only moderately successful during his lifetime, Gauguin has since been recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinct from Impressionism.

Gauguin was born in Paris in 1848, amidst the tumult of Europe&#x27;s revolutionary year. In 1850, Gauguin&#x27;s family settled in Peru, where he experienced a privileged childhood that left a lasting impression on him. Later, financial struggles led them back to France, where Gauguin received formal education. Initially working as a stockbroker, Gauguin started painting in his spare time, his interest in art kindled by visits to galleries and exhibitions. The financial crisis of 1882 significantly impacted his brokerage career, prompting a full-time shift to painting. Gauguin&#x27;s art education was largely self-taught and informal, shaped significantly by his associations with other artists rather than academic training. His entry into the art world was facilitated by his acquaintance with Camille Pissarro, a leading Impressionist. Pissarro took on a mentor role for Gauguin, introducing him to other Impressionist artists and techniques.

He exhibited with the Impressionists in the early 1880s, but soon began developing his distinct style, characterized by a bolder use of color and less traditional subject matter. His work in Brittany and Martinique showcased his inclination towards depicting native life and landscapes. By the 1890s, Gauguin&#x27;s art took a significant turn during his time in Tahiti, then a French colony, where he sought a refuge from the Western civilization, driven by the colonialist tropes of exoticism prevalent at the time. During that time, he controversially married three adolescent Tahitian girls with whom he later fathered children. Gauguin&#x27;s later years in Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands were marked by health issues and financial struggles.

His paintings from that period, characterized by vivid colors and Symbolist themes, would prove highly successful among the European viewers for their exploration of the relationships between people, nature, and the spiritual world. Gauguin&#x27;s art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. 

== Biography ==

=== Family history and early life ===
Gauguin was born in Paris to Clovis Gauguin and Aline Chazal on 7 June 1848, the year of revolutionary upheavals throughout Europe. His father, a 34-year-old liberal journalist from a family of entrepreneurs in Orléans, was compelled to flee France when the newspaper for which he wrote was suppressed by French authorities. Gauguin&#x27;s mother was the 22-year-old daughter of André Chazal, an engraver, and Flora Tristan, an author and activist in early socialist movements. Their union ended when André assaulted his wife Flora and was sentenced to prison for attempted murder.

Paul Gauguin&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Flora Tristan, was the illegitimate daughter of Thérèse Laisnay and Don Mariano de Tristan Moscoso. Details of Thérèse&#x27;s family background are not known; Don Mariano came from an aristocratic Spanish family from the Peruvian city of Arequipa. He was an officer of the Dragoons. Members of the wealthy Tristan Moscoso family held powerful positions in Peru. Nonetheless, Don Mariano&#x27;s unexpected death plunged his mistress and daughter Flora into poverty. When Flora&#x27;s marriage with André failed, she petitioned for and obtained a small monetary settlement from her father&#x27;s Peruvian relatives. She sailed to Peru in hopes of enlarging her share of the Tristan Moscoso family fortune. This never materialized; but she successfully published a popular travelogue of her experiences in Peru which launched her literary career in 1838. An active supporter of early socialist societies, Gauguin&#x27;s maternal grandmother helped to lay the foundations for the 1848 revolutionary movements. Placed under surveillance by French police and suffering from overwork, she died in 1844. Her grandson Paul &quot;idolized his grandmother, and kept copies of her books with him to the end of his life&quot;.

In 1850, Clovis Gauguin departed for Peru with his wife Aline and young children in hopes of continuing his journalistic career under the auspices of his wife&#x27;s South American relations. He died of a heart attack en route, and Aline arrived in Peru as a widow with the 18-month-old Paul and his 2 year-old sister, Marie. Gauguin&#x27;s mother was welcomed by her paternal granduncle, whose son-in-law, José Rufino Echenique, would shortly assume the presidency of Peru. To the age of six, Paul enjoyed a privileged upbringing, attended by nursemaids and servants. He retained a vivid memory of that period of his childhood which instilled &quot;indelible impressions of Peru that haunted him the rest of his life&quot;.

Gauguin&#x27;s idyllic childhood ended abruptly when his family mentors fell from political power during Peruvian civil conflicts in 1854. Aline returned to France with her children, leaving Paul with his paternal grandfather, Guillaume Gauguin, in Orléans. Deprived by the Peruvian Tristan Moscoso clan of a generous annuity arranged by her granduncle, Aline settled in Paris to work as a dressmaker.

=== Education and first job ===
After attending a couple of local schools, Gauguin was sent to the prestigious Catholic boarding school Petit Séminaire de La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin. He spent three years at the school. At the age of 14, he entered the Loriol Institute in Paris, a naval preparatory school, before returning to Orléans to take his final year at the Lycée Jeanne D&#x27;Arc. Gauguin signed on as a pilot&#x27;s assistant in the merchant marine. Three years later, he joined the French navy in which he served for two years. His mother died on 7 July 1867, but he did not learn of it for several months until a letter from his sister Marie caught up with him in India.

In 1871, Gauguin returned to Paris where he secured a job as a stockbroker. A close family friend, Gustave Arosa, got him a job at the Paris Bourse; Gauguin was 23. He became a successful Parisian businessman and remained one for the next 11 years. In 1879 he was earning 30,000 francs a year (about $145,000 in 2019 US dollars) as a stockbroker, and as much again in his dealings in the art market. But in 1882 the Paris stock market crashed and the art market contracted. Gauguin&#x27;s earnings deteriorated sharply and he eventually decided to pursue painting full-time.

=== Marriage ===

In 1873, he married a Danish woman, Mette-Sophie Gad (1850–1920). Over the next ten years, they had five children: Émile (1874–1955); Aline (1877–1897); Clovis (1879–1900); Jean René (1881–1961); and Paul Rollon (1883–1961). By 1884, Gauguin had moved with his family to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he pursued a business career as a tarpaulin salesman. It was not a success: He could not speak Danish, and the Danes did not want French tarpaulins. Mette became the chief breadwinner, giving French lessons to trainee diplomats. 

His middle-class family and marriage fell apart after 11 years when Gauguin was driven to paint full-time. He returned to Paris in 1885, after his wife and her family asked him to leave because he had renounced the values they shared. Gauguin&#x27;s last physical contact with them was in 1891, and Mette eventually broke with him decisively in 1894.

=== First paintings ===

In 1873, around the time he became a stockbroker, Gauguin began painting in his free time. His Parisian life centered on the 9th arrondissement of Paris. Gauguin lived at 15, rue la Bruyère. Nearby were the cafés frequented by the Impressionists. Gauguin also visited galleries frequently and purchased work by emerging artists. He formed a friendship with Camille Pissarro and visited him on Sundays to paint in his garden. Pissarro introduced him to various other artists. In 1877 Gauguin &quot;moved downmarket and across the river to the poorer, newer, urban sprawls&quot; of . Here, on the third floor at 8 rue Carcel, he had his first home with a studio.

His close friend Émile Schuffenecker, a former stockbroker who also aspired to become an artist, lived close by. Gauguin showed paintings in Impressionist exhibitions held in 1881 and 1882 (earlier, a sculpture of his son Émile had been the only sculpture in the 4th Impressionist Exhibition of 1879). His paintings received dismissive reviews, although several of them, such as &quot;The Market Gardens of Vaugirard&quot;, are now highly regarded.

In 1882, the stock market crashed and the art market contracted. Paul Durand-Ruel, the Impressionists&#x27; primary art dealer, was especially affected by the crash, and for a period of time stopped buying pictures from painters such as Gauguin. Gauguin&#x27;s earnings contracted sharply, and over the next two years he slowly formulated his plans to become a full-time artist. The following two summers, he painted with Pissarro and occasionally Paul Cézanne.

In October 1883, he wrote to Pissarro saying that he had decided to make his living from painting at all costs and asked for his help, which Pissarro at first readily provided. The following January, Gauguin moved with his family to Rouen, where they could live more cheaply and where he thought he had discerned opportunities when visiting Pissarro there the previous summer. However, the venture proved unsuccessful, and by the end of the year Mette and the children moved to Copenhagen, Gauguin following shortly after in November 1884, bringing with him his art collection, which subsequently remained in Copenhagen.

Life in Copenhagen proved equally difficult, and their marriage grew strained. At Mette&#x27;s urging, supported by her family, Gauguin returned to Paris the following year.

=== France 1885–1886 ===

After a brief period in Italy, spent in the small towns of San Salvo and Ururi, Gauguin returned to Paris in June 1885, accompanied by his six-year-old son Clovis. The other children remained with Mette in Copenhagen, where they had the support of family and friends while Mette herself was able to get work as a translator and French teacher. Gauguin initially found it difficult to re-enter the art world in Paris and spent his first winter back in real poverty, obliged to take a series of menial jobs. Clovis eventually fell ill and was sent to a boarding school, Gauguin&#x27;s sister Marie providing the funds. During this first year, Gauguin produced very little art. He exhibited 19 paintings and a wood relief at the eighth (and last) Impressionist exhibition in May 1886.

Most of these paintings were earlier work from Rouen or Copenhagen and there was nothing really novel in the few new ones, although his &quot;Baigneuses à Dieppe&quot; (&quot;Women Bathing&quot;) introduced what was to become a recurring motif, the woman in the waves. Nevertheless, Félix Bracquemond did purchase one of his paintings. This exhibition also established Georges Seurat as leader of the &quot;avant-garde&quot; movement in Paris. Gauguin contemptuously rejected Seurat&#x27;s Neo-Impressionist Pointillist technique and later in the year broke decisively with Pissarro, who from that point on was rather antagonistic towards Gauguin.

Gauguin spent the summer of 1886 in the artist&#x27;s colony of Pont-Aven in Brittany. He was attracted in the first place because it was cheap to live there. However, he found himself an unexpected success with the young art students who flocked there in the summer. His naturally pugilistic temperament (he was both an accomplished boxer and fencer) was no impediment in the socially relaxed seaside resort. He was remembered during that period as much for his outlandish appearance as for his art. Amongst these new associates was Charles Laval, who would accompany Gauguin the following year to Panama and Martinique.

That summer, he executed some pastel drawings of nude figures in the manner of Pissarro and those by Degas exhibited at the 1886 eighth Impressionist exhibition. He mainly painted landscapes such as &quot;La Bergère Bretonne&quot; (&quot;The Breton Shepherdess&quot;), in which the figure plays a subordinate role. His &quot;Jeunes Bretons au bain&quot; (&quot;Young Breton Boys Bathing&quot;), introducing a theme he returned to each time he visited Pont-Aven, is clearly indebted to Degas in its design and bold use of pure colour. The naive drawings of the English illustrator Randolph Caldecott, used to illustrate a popular guide-book on Brittany, had caught the imagination of the &quot;avant-garde&quot; student artists at Pont-Aven, anxious to free themselves from the conservatism of their academies, and Gauguin consciously imitated them in his sketches of Breton girls. These sketches were later worked up into paintings back in his Paris studio. The most important of these is &quot;Four Breton Women&quot;, which shows a marked departure from his earlier Impressionist style as well as incorporating something of the naive quality of Caldecott&#x27;s illustration, exaggerating features to the point of caricature.

Gauguin, along with Émile Bernard, Charles Laval, Émile Schuffenecker and many others, re-visited Pont-Aven after his travels in Panama and Martinique. The bold use of pure colour and Symbolist choice of subject matter distinguish what is now called the Pont-Aven School. Disappointed with Impressionism, Gauguin felt that traditional European painting had become too imitative and lacked symbolic depth. By contrast, the art of Africa and Asia seemed to him full of mystic symbolism and vigour. There was a vogue in Europe at the time for the art of other cultures, especially that of Japan (Japonism). He was invited to participate in the 1889 exhibition organized by Les XX.

=== Cloisonnism and synthetism ===

Under the influence of folk art and Japanese prints, Gauguin&#x27;s work evolved towards Cloisonnism, a style given its name by the critic Édouard Dujardin to describe Émile Bernard&#x27;s method of painting with flat areas of colour and bold outlines, which reminded Dujardin of the Medieval cloisonné enameling technique. Gauguin was very appreciative of Bernard&#x27;s art and of his daring with the employment of a style which suited Gauguin in his quest to express the essence of the objects in his art.

In Gauguin&#x27;s &quot;The Yellow Christ&quot; (1889), often cited as a quintessential Cloisonnist work, the image was reduced to areas of pure colour separated by heavy black outlines. In such works Gauguin paid little attention to classical perspective and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of colour, thereby dispensing with the two most characteristic principles of post-Renaissance painting. His painting later evolved towards Synthetism in which neither form nor colour predominate but each has an equal role.

=== Panama Canal ===

In 1887, Gauguin left France along with his friend, another young painter, Charles Laval. His dream was to purchase land of his own on the small Panamanian island of Taboga, where he stated he desired to live &quot;on fish and fruit and for nothing… without anxiety for the day or for the morrow.&quot; By the time he reached the port city of Colón, Gauguin was out of money and found work as a laborer on the French construction of the Panama Canal. During this time, Gauguin penned letters to his wife, Mette, lamenting the arduous conditions: &quot;I have to dig… from five-thirty in the morning to six in the evening, under the tropical sun and rain,&quot; he wrote. &quot;At night I am devoured by mosquitoes.&quot; Meanwhile, Laval had been earning money by drawing portraits of canal officials, work which Gauguin detested since only portraits done in a lewd manner would sell.

Gauguin held a profound contempt for Panama, and at one point was arrested in Panama City for urinating in public. Marched across town at gunpoint, Gauguin was ordered to pay a fine of four francs. After discovering that land on Taboga was priced far beyond reach (and after falling deathly ill on the island where he was subsequently interned in a yellow fever and malaria sanatorium), he decided to leave Panama.

=== Martinique ===

Later that same year, Gauguin and Laval spent the time from June to November near Saint Pierre on the Caribbean island of Martinique, a French colony. His thoughts and experiences during this time are recorded in his letters to his wife and his artist friend Emile Schuffenecker. At the time, France had a policy of repatriation where if a citizen became broke or stranded on a French colony, the state would pay for the boat ride back. Upon leaving Panama, protected by the repatriation policy, Gauguin and Laval decided to disembark at the Martinique port of St. Pierre. Scholars disagree on whether Gauguin intentionally or spontaneously decided to stay on the island.

At first, the &#x27;negro hut&#x27; in which they lived suited him, and he enjoyed watching people in their daily activities. However, the weather in the summer was hot and the hut leaked in the rain. Gauguin also suffered dysentery and marsh fever. While in Martinique, he produced between 10 and 20 works (12 being the most common estimate), traveled widely and apparently came into contact with a small community of Indian immigrants; a contact that would later influence his art through the incorporation of Indian symbols. During his stay, the writer Lafcadio Hearn was also on the island. His account provides an historical comparison to accompany Gauguin&#x27;s images.

Gauguin finished 11 known paintings during his stay in Martinique, many of which seem to be derived from his hut. His letters to Schuffenecker express an excitement about the exotic location and natives represented in his paintings. Gauguin asserted that four of his paintings on the island were better than the rest. The works as a whole are brightly coloured, loosely painted, outdoor figural scenes. Even though his time on the island was short, it surely was influential. He recycled some of his figures and sketches in later paintings, such as the motif in &quot;Among the Mangoes&quot;, which is replicated on his fans. Rural and indigenous populations remained a popular subject in Gauguin&#x27;s work after he left the island.

=== Vincent and Theo van Gogh ===

Gauguin&#x27;s Martinique paintings were exhibited at his colour merchant Arsène Poitier&#x27;s gallery. There they were seen and admired by Vincent van Gogh and his art dealer brother Theo, whose firm Goupil &amp; Cie had dealings with Portier. Theo purchased three of Gauguin&#x27;s paintings for 900 francs and arranged to have them hung at Goupil&#x27;s, thus introducing Gauguin to wealthy clients. This arrangement with Goupil&#x27;s continued past Theo&#x27;s death in 1891. At the same time, Vincent and Gauguin became close friends (on Vincent&#x27;s part it amounted to something akin to adulation) and they corresponded together on art, a correspondence that was instrumental in Gauguin formulating his philosophy of art.

In 1888, at Theo&#x27;s instigation, Gauguin and Vincent spent nine weeks painting together at Vincent&#x27;s Yellow House in Arles in the South of France. Gauguin&#x27;s relationship with Vincent proved fraught. Their relationship deteriorated and eventually Gauguin decided to leave. On the evening of 23 December 1888, according to a much later account of Gauguin&#x27;s, Vincent confronted Gauguin with a straight razor. Later the same evening, he cut off his own left ear. He wrapped the severed tissue in newspaper and handed it to a woman who worked at a brothel Gauguin and Vincent had both visited, and asked her to &quot;keep this object carefully, in remembrance of me&quot;. Vincent was hospitalized the following day and Gauguin left Arles. They never saw each other again, but they continued to correspond, and in 1890 Gauguin went so far as to propose they form an artist studio in Antwerp. An 1889 sculptural self-portrait &quot;Jug in the Form of a Head&quot; appears to reference Gauguin&#x27;s traumatic relationship with Vincent.

Gauguin later claimed to have been instrumental in influencing Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s development as a painter at Arles. While Vincent did briefly experiment with Gauguin&#x27;s theory of &quot;painting from the imagination&quot; in paintings such as &quot;Memory of the Garden at Etten&quot;, it did not suit him and he quickly returned to painting from nature.

=== Edgar Degas ===

Although Gauguin made some of his early strides in the world of art under Pissarro, Edgar Degas was Gauguin&#x27;s most admired contemporary artist and a great influence on his work from the beginning, with his figures and interiors as well as a carved and painted medallion of singer Valérie Roumi. He had a deep reverence for Degas&#x27; artistic dignity and tact. It was Gauguin&#x27;s healthiest, longest-lasting friendship, spanning his entire artistic career until his death.

In addition to being one of his earliest supporters, including buying Gauguin&#x27;s work and persuading dealer Paul Durand-Ruel to do the same, there was never a public support for Gauguin more unwavering than from Degas. Gauguin also purchased work from Degas in the early to mid-1870s and his own monotyping predilection was probably influenced by Degas&#x27; advancements in the medium.
Gauguin&#x27;s Durand-Ruel exhibition in November 1893, which Degas chiefly organized, received mixed reviews. Among the mocking were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and former friend Pissarro. Degas, however, praised his work, purchasing &quot;&quot; and admiring the exotic sumptuousness of Gauguin&#x27;s conjured folklore. In appreciation, Gauguin presented Degas with &quot;The Moon and the Earth&quot;, one of the exhibited paintings that had attracted the most hostile criticism. Gauguin&#x27;s late canvas &quot;Riders on the Beach&quot; (two versions) recalls Degas&#x27; horse pictures that he started in the 1860s, specifically &quot;Racetrack&quot; and &quot;Before the Race&quot;, testifying to his enduring effect on Gauguin. Degas later purchased two paintings at Gauguin&#x27;s 1895 auction to raise funds for his final trip to Tahiti. These were &quot;Vahine no te vi (Woman with a Mango)&quot; and the version Gauguin painted of Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot; Olympia&quot;.

=== First visit to Tahiti ===
By 1890, Gauguin had conceived the project of making Tahiti his next artistic destination. A successful auction of paintings in Paris at the Hôtel Drouot in February 1891, along with other events such as a banquet and a benefit concert, provided the necessary funds. The auction had been greatly helped by a flattering review from Octave Mirbeau, courted by Gauguin through Camille Pissarro. After visiting his wife and children in Copenhagen, for what turned out to be the last time, Gauguin set sail for Tahiti on 1 April 1891, promising to return a rich man and make a fresh start. His avowed intent was to escape European civilization and &quot;everything that is artificial and conventional&quot;. Nevertheless, he took care to take with him a collection of visual stimuli in the form of photographs, drawings and prints.

He spent the first three months in Papeete, the capital of the colony and already much influenced by French and European culture. His biographer Belinda Thomson observes that he must have been disappointed in his vision of a primitive idyll. He was unable to afford the pleasure-seeking life-style in Papeete, and an early attempt at a portrait, &quot;Suzanne Bambridge&quot;, was not well liked. He decided to set up his studio in Mataiea, Papeari, some from Papeete, installing himself in a native-style bamboo hut. Here he executed paintings depicting Tahitian life such as &quot;Fatata te Miti (By the Sea)&quot; and &quot;Ia Orana Maria (Ave Maria)&quot;, the latter to become his most prized Tahitian painting.
Many of his finest paintings date from this period. His first portrait of a Tahitian model is thought to be &quot;Vahine no te tiare&quot; (&quot;Woman with a Flower&quot;). The painting is notable for the care with which it delineates Polynesian features. He sent the painting to his patron George-Daniel de Monfreid, a friend of Schuffenecker, who was to become Gauguin&#x27;s devoted champion in Tahiti. By late summer 1892 this painting was being displayed at Goupil&#x27;s gallery in Paris. Art historian Nancy Mowll Mathews believes that Gauguin&#x27;s encounter with exotic sensuality in Tahiti, so evident in the painting, was by far the most important aspect of his sojourn there. He often rendered titles of his works in Tahitian, although some of these titles were misconjugated to a point where they were hard to understand by native Tahitian speakers themselves.

Gauguin was lent copies of 1837 &quot;Voyage aux îles du Grand Océan&quot; and 1855 &quot;État de la société tahitienne à l&#x27;arrivée des Européens&quot;, containing full accounts of Tahiti&#x27;s forgotten culture and religion. Gauguin was fascinated by the accounts of &quot;Arioi&quot; society and their god &#x27;Oro. Because these accounts contained no illustrations and the Tahitian models had in any case long disappeared, he could give free rein to his imagination. He executed some twenty paintings and a dozen woodcarvings over the next year. The first of these was &quot;Te aa no areois (The Seed of the Areoi)&quot;, representing Oro&#x27;s terrestrial wife Vairaumati, now held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His illustrated notebook of the time, &quot;,&quot; is preserved in the Louvre and was published in facsimile form in 1951.

In all, Gauguin sent nine of his paintings to Monfreid in Paris. These were eventually exhibited in Copenhagen in a joint exhibition with the late Vincent van Gogh. Reports that they had been well received (though in fact only two of the Tahitian paintings were sold and his earlier paintings were unfavourably compared with van Gogh&#x27;s) were sufficiently encouraging for Gauguin to contemplate returning with some seventy others he had completed. He had in any case largely run out of funds, depending on a state grant for a free passage home. In addition he had some health problems diagnosed as heart problems by the local doctor, which Mathews suggests may have been the early signs of cardiovascular syphilis.

Gauguin later wrote a travelogue (first published 1901) titled &quot;&quot;, originally conceived as commentary on his paintings and describing his experiences in Tahiti. Modern critics have suggested that the contents of the book were in part fantasized and plagiarized. In it he revealed that he had at this time taken a 13-year-old girl as native wife or &quot;vahine&quot; (the Tahitian word for &quot;woman&quot;), a marriage contracted in the course of a single afternoon. This was Teha&#x27;amana, called Tehura in the travelogue, who was pregnant by him by the end of summer 1892. Teha&#x27;amana was the subject of several of Gauguin&#x27;s paintings, including &quot;Merahi metua no Tehamana&quot; and the celebrated &quot;Spirit of the Dead Watching&quot;, as well as a notable woodcarving &quot;Tehura&quot; now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. By the end of July 1893, Gauguin had decided to leave Tahiti and he would never see Teha&#x27;amana or their child again even after returning to the island several years later. A digital catalogue raisonné of the paintings from this period was released by the Wildenstein Plattner Institute in 2021.

=== Return to France ===


In August 1893, Gauguin returned to France, where he continued to execute paintings on Tahitian subjects such as &quot;Mahana no atua (Day of the God)&quot; and &quot;Nave nave moe (Sacred spring, sweet dreams)&quot;. An exhibition at the Durand-Ruel gallery in November 1894 was a moderate success, selling at quite elevated prices 11 of the 40 paintings exhibited. He set up an apartment at 6 rue Vercingétorix, on the edge of the Montparnasse district frequented by artists, and began to conduct a weekly &quot;salon&quot;. He affected an exotic &quot;persona&quot;, dressing in Polynesian costume, and conducted a public affair with a young woman still in her teens, &quot;half Indian, half Malayan&quot;, known as .

Despite the moderate success of his November exhibition, he subsequently lost Durand-Ruel&#x27;s patronage in circumstances that are not clear. Mathews characterises this as a tragedy for Gauguin&#x27;s career. Amongst other things he lost the chance of an introduction to the American market. The start of 1894 found him preparing woodcuts using an experimental technique for his proposed travelogue &quot;Noa Noa&quot;. He returned to Pont-Aven for the summer. In February 1895 he attempted an auction of his paintings at Hôtel Drouot in Paris, similar to the one of 1891, but this was not a success. The dealer Ambroise Vollard, however, showed his paintings at his gallery in March 1895, but they unfortunately did not come to terms at that date.

He submitted a large ceramic sculpture he called &quot;Oviri&quot; he had fired the previous winter to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 &quot;salon&quot; opening in April. There are conflicting versions of how it was received: his biographer and &quot;Noa Noa&quot; collaborator, the Symbolist poet , contended (1920) that the work was &quot;literally expelled&quot; from the exhibition, while Vollard said (1937) that the work was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw all his own work. In any case, Gauguin took the opportunity to increase his public exposure by writing an outraged letter on the state of modern ceramics to &quot;Le Soir&quot;.

By this time it had become clear that he and his wife Mette were irrevocably separated. Although there had been hopes of a reconciliation, they had quickly quarrelled over money matters and neither visited the other. Gauguin initially refused to share any part of a 13,000-franc inheritance from his uncle Isidore which he had come into shortly after returning. Mette was eventually gifted 1,500 francs, but she was outraged and from that point on kept in contact with him only through Schuffeneckerdoubly galling for Gauguin, as his friend thus knew the true extent of his betrayal.

By mid 1895 attempts to raise funds for Gauguin&#x27;s return to Tahiti had failed, and he began accepting charity from friends. In June 1895 Eugène Carrière arranged a cheap passage back to Tahiti, and Gauguin never saw Europe again.
=== Residence in Tahiti ===

Gauguin set out for Tahiti again on 28 June 1895. His return is characterised by Thomson as an essentially negative one, his disillusionment with the Paris art scene compounded by two attacks on him in the same issue of &quot;Mercure de France&quot;; one by Emile Bernard, the other by Camille Mauclair. Mathews remarks that his isolation in Paris had become so bitter that he had no choice but to try to reclaim his place in Tahiti society.

He arrived in September 1895 and was to spend the next six years living, for the most part, an apparently comfortable life as an artist-&quot;colon&quot; near, or at times in, Papeete. During this time he was able to support himself with an increasingly steady stream of sales and the support of friends and well-wishers, though there was a period of time 1898–1899 when he felt compelled to take a desk job in Papeete, of which there is not much record. He built a spacious reed and thatch house at Puna&#x27;auia in an affluent area ten miles east of Papeete, settled by wealthy families, in which he installed a large studio, sparing no expense. Jules Agostini, an acquaintance of Gauguin&#x27;s and an accomplished amateur photographer, photographed the house in 1896. Later a sale of land obliged him to build a new one in the same neighbourhood.

He maintained a horse and trap, so was in a position to travel daily to Papeete to participate in the social life of the colony should he wish. He subscribed to the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; (indeed was a shareholder), by then France&#x27;s foremost critical journal, and kept up an active correspondence with fellow artists, dealers, critics, and patrons in Paris. During his year in Papeete and thereafter, he played an increasing role in local politics, contributing abrasively to a local journal opposed to the colonial government, &quot;Les Guêpes (The Wasps)&quot;, that had recently been formed, and eventually edited his own monthly publication &quot;Le Sourire: Journal sérieux (The Smile: A Serious Newspaper)&quot;, later titled simply &quot;Journal méchant (A Wicked Newspaper)&quot;. A certain amount of artwork and woodcuts from his newspaper survive. In February 1900 he became the editor of &quot;Les Guêpes&quot; itself, for which he drew a salary, and he continued as editor until he left Tahiti in September 1901. The paper under his editorship was noted for its scurrilous attacks on the governor and officialdom in general, but was not in fact a champion of native causes, although perceived as such nevertheless.

For the first year at least he produced no paintings, informing Monfreid that he proposed henceforth to concentrate on sculpture. Few of his wooden carvings from this period survive, most of them collected by Monfreid. Thomson cites &quot;Oyez Hui Iesu (Christ on the Cross)&quot;, a wooden cylinder half a metre (20&quot;) tall featuring a curious hybrid of religious motifs. The cylinder may have been inspired by similar symbolic carvings in Brittany, such as at Pleumeur-Bodou, where ancient menhirs have been Christianised by local craftsmen. When he resumed painting, it was to continue his long-standing series of sexually charged nudes in paintings such as &quot;Te tamari no atua (Son of God)&quot; and &quot;O Taiti (Nevermore)&quot;. Thomson observes a progression in complexity. Mathews notes a return to Christian symbolism that would have endeared him to the colonists of the time, now anxious to preserve what was left of native culture by stressing the universality of religious principles. In these paintings, Gauguin was addressing an audience amongst his fellow colonists in Papeete, not his former &quot;avant-garde&quot; audience in Paris.

His health took a decided turn for the worse and he was hospitalised several times for a variety of ailments. While he was in France, he had his ankle shattered in a drunken brawl on a seaside visit to Concarneau. The injury, an open fracture, never healed properly. Then painful and debilitating sores that restricted his movement began erupting up and down his legs. These were treated with arsenic. Gauguin blamed the tropical climate and described the sores as &quot;eczema&quot;, but his biographers agree this must have been the progress of syphilis.
In April 1897, he received word that his favorite daughter Aline had died from pneumonia. This was also the month he learned he had to vacate his house because its land had been sold. He took out a bank loan to build a much more extravagant wooden house with beautiful views of the mountains and sea. But he overextended himself in so doing, and by the end of the year faced the real prospect of his bank foreclosing on him. Failing health and pressing debts brought him to the brink of despair. At the end of the year he completed his monumental &quot;Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?&quot;, which he regarded as his masterpiece and final artistic testament (in a letter to Monfreid he explained that he tried to kill himself after finishing it). The painting was exhibited at Vollard&#x27;s gallery in November the following year, along with eight thematically related paintings he had completed by July. This was his first major exhibition in Paris since his Durand-Ruel show in 1893 and it was a decided success, critics praising his new serenity. &quot;Where do we come from?&quot;, however, received mixed reviews and Vollard had difficulty selling it. He eventually sold it in 1901 for 2,500 francs (about $10,000 in year 2000 US dollars) to , of which Vollard&#x27;s commission was perhaps as much as 500 francs.
Georges Chaudet, Gauguin&#x27;s Paris dealer, died in the fall of 1899. Vollard had been buying Gauguin&#x27;s paintings through Chaudet and now made an agreement with Gauguin directly. The agreement provided Gauguin a regular monthly advance of 300 francs against a guaranteed purchase of at least 25 unseen paintings a year at 200 francs each, and in addition Vollard undertook to provide him with his art materials. There were some initial problems on both sides, but Gauguin was finally able to realise his long cherished plan of resettling in the Marquesas Islands in search of a yet more primitive society. He spent his final months in Tahiti living in considerable comfort, as attested by the liberality with which he entertained his friends at that time.

Gauguin was unable to continue his work in ceramics in the islands for the simple reason that suitable clay was not available. Similarly, without access to a printing press (&quot;Le Sourire&quot; was hectographed), he was obliged to turn to the monotype process in his graphic work. Surviving examples of these prints are rather rare and command very high prices in the saleroom.

During this time Gauguin maintained a relationship with Pahura (Pau&#x27;ura) a Tai, the daughter of neighbours in Puna&#x27;auia. Gauguin began this relationship when Pau&#x27;ura was years old. He fathered two children with her, of which a daughter died in infancy. The other, a boy, she raised herself. His descendants still inhabited Tahiti at the time of Mathews&#x27; biography. Pahura refused to accompany Gauguin to the Marquesas away from her family in Puna&#x27;auia (earlier she had left him when he took work in Papeete just 10 miles away). When the English writer Willam Somerset Maugham visited her in 1917, she could offer him no useful memory of Gauguin and chided him for visiting her without bringing money from Gauguin&#x27;s family.

=== Marquesas Islands ===

Gauguin had nurtured his plan of settling in the Marquesas ever since seeing a collection of intricately carved Marquesan bowls and weapons in Papeete during his first months in Tahiti. However, he found a society that, as in Tahiti, had lost its cultural identity. Of all the Pacific island groups, the Marquesas were the most affected by the import of Western diseases (especially tuberculosis). An 18th-century population of some 80,000 had declined to just 4,000. Catholic missionaries held sway and, in their effort to control drunkenness and promiscuity, obliged all native children to attend missionary schools into their teens. French colonial rule was enforced by a gendarmerie noted for its malevolence and stupidity, while traders, both Western and Chinese, exploited the natives appallingly.

Gauguin settled in Atuona on the island of Hiva-Oa, arriving 16 September 1901. This was the administrative capital of the island group, but considerably less developed than Papeete although there was an efficient and regular steamer service between the two. There was a military doctor but no hospital. The doctor was relocated to Papeete the following February and thereafter Gauguin had to rely on the island&#x27;s two health care workers, the Vietnamese exile Nguyen Van Cam (Ky Dong), who had settled on the island but had no formal medical training, and the Protestant pastor Paul Vernier, who had studied medicine in addition to theology. Both of these were to become close friends.

He bought a plot of land in the center of the town from the Catholic mission, having first ingratiated himself with the local bishop by attending mass regularly. This bishop was Monseigneur Joseph Martin, initially well disposed to Gauguin because he was aware that Gauguin had sided with the Catholic party in Tahiti in his journalism.
Gauguin built a two-floor house on his plot, sturdy enough to survive a later cyclone which washed away most other dwellings in the town. He was helped in the task by the two best Marquesan carpenters on the island, one of them called Tioka, tattooed from head to toe in the traditional Marquesan way (a tradition suppressed by the missionaries). Tioka was a deacon in Vernier&#x27;s congregation and became Gauguin&#x27;s neighbour after the cyclone when Gauguin gifted him a corner of his plot. The ground floor was open-air and used for dining and living, while the top floor was used for sleeping and as his studio. The door to the top floor was decorated with a polychrome wood-carved lintel and jambs that still survive in museums. The lintel named the house as &quot;Maison du Jouir&quot; (i.e. &quot;House of Pleasure&quot;), while the jambs echoed his earlier 1889 wood-carving &quot;Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses&quot; (i.e. &quot;Be in Love, You Will Be Happy&quot;). The walls were decorated with, amongst other things, his prized collection of forty-five pornographic photographs he had purchased in Port Said on his way out from France.

In the early days at least, until Gauguin found a &quot;vahine&quot;, the house drew appreciative crowds in the evenings from the natives, who came to stare at the pictures and party half the night away. Needless to say, all this did not endear Gauguin to the bishop, still less when Gauguin erected two sculptures he placed at the foot of his steps lampooning the bishop and a servant reputed to be the bishop&#x27;s mistress, and yet still less when Gauguin later attacked the unpopular missionary school system. The sculpture of the bishop, &quot;Père Paillard&quot;, is to be found at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, while its pendant piece &quot;Thérèse&quot; realized a record $30,965,000 for a Gauguin sculpture at a Christie&#x27;s New York 2015 sale. These were among at least eight sculptures that adorned the house according to a posthumous inventory, most of which are lost today. Together they represented a very public attack on the hypocrisy of the church in sexual matters.

State funding for the missionary schools had ceased as a result of the 1901 Associations Bill promulgated throughout the French empire. The schools continued with difficulty as private institutions, but these difficulties were compounded when Gauguin established that attendance at any given school was only compulsory within a catchment area of some two and a half miles radius. This led to numerous teenage daughters being withdrawn from the schools (Gauguin called this process &quot;rescuing&quot;). He took as &quot;vahine&quot; one such girl, Vaeoho (also called Marie-Rose), the 14-year-old daughter of a native couple who lived in an adjoining valley six miles distant. This can scarcely have been a pleasant task for her as Gauguin&#x27;s sores were by then extremely noxious and required daily dressing. Nevertheless, she lived willingly with him and the following year gave birth to a healthy daughter whose descendants continue to live on the island.
By November he had settled into his new home with Vaeoho, a cook (Kahui), two other servants (nephews of Tioka), his dog, Pegau (a play on his initials &quot;PG&quot;), and a cat. The house itself, although in the center of the town, was set amongst trees and secluded from view. The partying ceased and he began a period of productive work, sending twenty canvases to Vollard the following April. He had thought he would find new motifs in the Marquesas, writing to Monfreid: In fact, his Marquesas work for the most part can only be distinguished from his Tahiti work by experts or by their dates, paintings such as &quot;Two Women&quot; remaining uncertain in their location. For Anna Szech, what distinguishes them is their repose and melancholy, albeit containing elements of disquiet. Thus, in the second of two versions of &quot;Cavaliers sur la Plage (Riders on the Beach)&quot;, gathering clouds and foamy breakers suggest an impending storm while the two distant figures on grey horses echo similar figures in other paintings that are taken to symbolise death.

Gauguin chose to paint landscapes, still lifes, and figure studies at this time, with an eye to Vollard&#x27;s clientele, avoiding the primitive and lost paradise themes of his Tahiti paintings. But there is a significant trio of pictures from this last period that suggest deeper concerns. The first two of these are &quot;Jeune fille à l&#x27;éventail (Young Girl with Fan)&quot; and &quot;Le Sorcier d&#x27;Hiva Oa (Marquesan Man in a Red Cape)&quot;. The model for &quot;Jeune fille&quot; was the red-headed Tohotaua, the daughter of a chieftain on a neighbouring island. The portrait appears to have been taken from a portrait photograph of Tohotaua by Louis Grelet that Vernier later sent to Vollard. The model for &quot;Le sorcier&quot; may have been Haapuani, an accomplished dancer as well as a feared magician, who was a close friend of Gauguin&#x27;s and, according to Bengt Danielsson, married to Tohotau. Szech notes that the white colour of Tohotau&#x27;s dress is a symbol of power and death in Polynesian culture, the sitter doing duty for a Maohi culture as a whole threatened with extinction. &quot;Le Sorcier&quot; appears to have been executed at the same time and depicts a long-haired young man wearing an exotic red cape. The androgynous nature of the image has attracted critical attention, giving rise to speculation that Gauguin intended to depict a &quot;māhū&quot; (i.e. a third gender person) rather than a &quot;taua&quot; or priest. The third picture of the trio is the mysterious and beautiful &quot;Contes barbares (Primitive Tales)&quot; featuring Tohotau again at the right. The left figure is Jacob Meyer de Haan, a painter friend of Gauguin&#x27;s from their Pont-Aven days who had died a few years previously, while the middle figure is again androgynous, identified by some as Haapuani. The Buddha-like pose and the lotus blossoms suggests to Elizabeth Childs that the picture is a meditation on the perpetual cycle of life and the possibility of rebirth. As these paintings reached Vollard after Gauguin&#x27;s sudden death, nothing is known about Gauguin&#x27;s intentions in their execution.

In March 1902, the governor of French Polynesia, , arrived in the Marquesas to make an inspection. He was accompanied by Édouard Charlier as head of the judicial system. Charlier was an amateur painter who had been befriended by Gauguin when he first arrived as magistrate at Papeete in 1895. However their relationship had turned to enmity when Charlier refused to prosecute Gauguin&#x27;s then &quot;vahine&quot; Pau&#x27;ura for a number of trivial offences, allegedly housebreaking and theft, she had committed at Puna&#x27;auia while Gauguin was away working in Papeete. Gauguin had gone so far as to publish an open letter attacking Charlier about the affair in &quot;Les Guêpes&quot;. Petit, presumably suitably forewarned, refused to see Gauguin to deliver the settlers&#x27; protests (Gauguin their spokesman) about the invidious taxation system, which saw most revenue from the Marquesas spent in Papeete. Gauguin responded in April by refusing to pay his taxes and encouraging the settlers, traders and planters, to do likewise.

At around the same time, Gauguin&#x27;s health began to deteriorate again, revisited by the same familiar constellation of symptoms involving pain in the legs, heart palpitations, and general debility. The pain in his injured ankle grew insupportable and in July he was obliged to order a trap from Papeete so that he could get about town. By September the pain was so extreme that he resorted to morphine injections. However he was sufficiently concerned by the habit he was developing to turn his syringe set over to a neighbour, relying instead on laudanum. His sight was also beginning to fail him, as attested by the spectacles he wears in his last known self-portrait. This was actually a portrait commenced by his friend Ky Dong that he completed himself, thus accounting for its uncharacteristic style. It shows a man tired and aged, yet not entirely defeated. For a while he considered returning to Europe, to Spain, to get treatment. Monfreid advised him:

In July 1902, Vaeoho, by then seven months pregnant, left Gauguin to return home to her neighbouring valley of Hekeani to have her baby amongst family and friends. She gave birth in September but did not return. Gauguin did not subsequently take another &quot;vahine&quot;. It was at this time that his quarrel with Bishop Martin over missionary schools reached its height. The local gendarme, Désiré Charpillet, at first friendly to Gauguin, wrote a report to the administrator of the island group, who resided on the neighbouring island of Nuku Hiva, criticizing Gauguin for encouraging natives to withdraw their children from school as well as encouraging settlers to withhold payment of their taxes. As luck would have it, the post of administrator had recently been filled by François Picquenot, an old friend of Gauguin&#x27;s from Tahiti and essentially sympathetic to him. Picquenot advised Charpillet not to take any action over the schools issue, since Gauguin had the law on his side, but authorised Charpillet to seize goods from Gauguin in lieu of payment of taxes if all else failed. Possibly prompted by loneliness, and at times unable to paint, Gauguin took to writing.
In 1901, the manuscript of &quot;Noa Noa&quot; that Gauguin had prepared along with woodcuts during his interlude in France was finally published with Morice&#x27;s poems in book form in the &quot;La Plume&quot; edition (the manuscript itself is now lodged in the Louvre museum). Sections of it (including his account of Teha&#x27;amana) had previously been published without woodcuts in 1897 in &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot;, while he himself had published extracts in &quot;Les Guêpes&quot; while he was editor. The &quot;La Plume&quot; edition was planned to include his woodcuts, but he withheld permission to print them on smooth paper as the publishers wished. In truth he had grown uninterested in the venture with Morice and never saw a copy, declining an offer of one hundred complimentary copies. Nevertheless, its publication inspired him to consider writing other books. At the beginning of the year (1902), he had revised an old 1896–97 manuscript, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Moderne et le Catholicisme&quot; (&quot;The Modern Spirit and Catholicism&quot;), on the Roman Catholic Church, adding some twenty pages containing insights gleaned from his dealings with Bishop Martin. He sent this text to Bishop Martin, who responded by sending him an illustrated history of the Church. Gauguin returned the book with critical remarks he later published in his autobiographical reminisces. He next prepared a witty and well-documented essay, &quot;Racontars de Rapin&quot; (&quot;Tales of a Dabbler&quot;) on critics and art criticism, which he sent for publication to André Fontainas, art critic at the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; whose favourable review of &quot;Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?&quot; had done much to restore his reputation. Fontainas, however, replied that he dared not publish it. It was not subsequently published until 1951.

On 27 May that year, the steamer service, &quot;Croix du Sud,&quot; was shipwrecked off the Apataki atoll, and for a period of three months the island was left without mail or supplies. When mail service resumed, Gauguin penned an angry attack on Governor Petit in an open letter, complaining amongst other things about the way they had been abandoned following the shipwreck. The letter was published by &quot;L&#x27;Indepéndant&quot;, the successor newspaper to &quot;Les Guêpes&quot;, that November in Papeete. Petit had in fact followed an independent and pro-native policy, to the disappointment of the Roman Catholic Party, and the newspaper was preparing an attack on him. Gauguin also sent the letter to the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, which published a redacted version of it after his death. He followed this with a private letter to the head of the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; in Papeete, complaining about his own local gendarme Charpillet&#x27;s excesses in making prisoners labor for him. Danielsson notes that, while these and similar complaints were well-founded, the motivation for them all was wounded vanity and simple animosity. As it happened, the relatively supportive Charpillet was replaced that December by another gendarme, Jean-Paul Claverie, from Tahiti, much less well disposed to Gauguin and who in fact had fined him in his earliest Mataiea days for public indecency, having caught him bathing naked in a local stream following complaints from the missionaries there.

His health further deteriorated in December to the extent that he was scarcely able to paint. He began an autobiographical memoir he called &quot;Avant et après (Before and After)&quot; (published in translation in the US as &quot;Intimate Journals&quot;), which he completed over the next two months. The title was supposed to reflect his experiences before and after coming to Tahiti and as tribute to his own grandmother&#x27;s unpublished memoir &quot;Past and Future&quot;. His memoir proved to be a fragmented collection of observations about life in Polynesia, his own life, and comments on literature and paintings. He included in it attacks on subjects as diverse as the local &quot;gendarmerie&quot;, Bishop Martin, his wife Mette and the Danes in general, and concluded with a description of his personal philosophy conceiving life as an existential struggle to reconcile opposing binaries. Mathews notes two closing remarks as a distillation of his philosophy: He sent the manuscript to Fontainas for editing, but the rights reverted to Mette after Gauguin&#x27;s death, and it was not published until 1918 (in a facsimile edition); the American translation appearing in 1921.

=== Death ===

At the beginning of 1903, Gauguin engaged in a campaign designed to expose the incompetence of the island&#x27;s gendarmes, in particular Jean-Paul Claverie, for taking the side of the natives directly in a case involving the alleged drunkenness of a group of them. Claverie, however, escaped censure. At the beginning of February, Gauguin wrote to the administrator, François Picquenot, alleging corruption by one of Claverie&#x27;s subordinates. Picquenot investigated the allegations but could not substantiate them. Claverie responded by filing a charge against Gauguin of libeling a gendarme. He was subsequently fined 500 francs and sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment by the local magistrate on 27 March 1903. Gauguin immediately filed an appeal in Papeete and set about raising the funds to travel to Papeete to hear his appeal.

At this time Gauguin was very weak and in great pain and resorted once again to using morphine. He died suddenly on the morning of 8 May 1903.

Earlier, he had sent for his pastor, Paul Vernier, complaining of fainting fits. They had chatted together, and Vernier had left, believing him in a stable condition. However, Gauguin&#x27;s neighbour, Tioka, found him dead at 11 o&#x27;clock, confirming the fact in the traditional Marquesan way by biting his scalp in an attempt to revive him. By his bedside was an empty bottle of laudanum, which has given rise to speculation that he was the victim of an overdose. Vernier believed he died of a heart attack.
Gauguin was buried in the Catholic Calvary Cemetery (Cimetière Calvaire), Atuona, Hiva &#x27;Oa, at 2 p.m. the next day. In 1973, a bronze cast of his &quot;Oviri&quot; figure was placed on his grave, as he had indicated was his wish. Ironically, his nearest neighbor in the cemetery is Bishop Martin, his grave surmounted by a large white cross. Vernier wrote an account of Gauguin&#x27;s last days and burial, reproduced in O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s edition of Gauguin&#x27;s letters to Monfreid.

Word of Gauguin&#x27;s death did not reach France (to Monfreid) until 23 August 1903. In the absence of a will, his less valuable effects were auctioned in Atuona while his letters, manuscripts, and paintings were auctioned in Papeete on 5 September 1903. Mathews notes that this speedy dispersal of his effects led to the loss of much valuable information about his later years. Thomson notes that the auction inventory of his effects (some of which were burned as pornography) revealed a life that was not as impoverished or primitive as he had liked to maintain. Mette Gauguin in due course received the proceeds of the auction, some 4,000 francs. One of the paintings auctioned in Papeete was &quot;Maternité II&quot;, a smaller version of &quot;Maternité I&quot; in the Hermitage Museum. The original was painted at the time his then &quot;vahine,&quot; Pau&#x27;ura, in Puna&#x27;auia, gave birth to their son Emile. It is not known why he painted the smaller copy. It was sold for 150 francs to a French naval officer, Commandant Cochin, who said that Governor Petit himself had bid up to 135 francs for the painting. It was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for US$39,208,000 in 2004.
The Paul Gauguin Cultural Center at Atuona has a reconstruction of the &quot;Maison du Jouir&quot;. The original house stood empty for a few years, the door still carrying Gauguin&#x27;s carved lintel. This was eventually recovered, four of the five pieces held at the Musée D&#x27;Orsay and the fifth at the Paul Gauguin Museum in Tahiti.

In 2007, four rotten molars, which may have been Gauguin&#x27;s, were found by archaeologists at the bottom of a well that he built on the island of Hiva Oa, on the Marquese Islands. In 2014, forensic examination of these teeth threw into question the conventional belief that Gauguin had suffered from syphilis. DNA examination established that the teeth were almost certainly Gauguin&#x27;s, but no traces were found of the mercury that was used to treat syphilis at the time, suggesting either that Gauguin did not suffer from syphilis or that he was not being treated for it.

=== Children ===
Gauguin outlived three of his children; his favorite daughter Aline died of pneumonia, his son Clovis died of a blood infection following a hip operation, and a daughter, whose birth was portrayed in Gauguin&#x27;s painting of 1896 &quot;Te tamari no atua&quot;, the child of Gauguin&#x27;s young Tahitian mistress, Pau&#x27;ura, died only a few days after her birth on Christmas Day 1896. His son, Émile Gauguin, worked as a construction engineer in the U.S. and is buried in Lemon Bay Historical Cemetery, in Florida. Another son, Jean René, became a well-known sculptor and a staunch socialist. He died on 21 April 1961 in Copenhagen. Pola (Paul Rollon) became an artist and art critic and wrote a memoir, &quot;My Father, Paul Gauguin&quot; (1937). 

Gauguin had several other children by his mistresses: Germaine (born 1891) with Juliette Huais (1866–1955); Émile Marae a Tai (born 1899) with Pau&#x27;ura; and a daughter (born 1902) with Vaeoho (Marie-Rose). There is some speculation that the Belgian artist, Germaine Chardon, was Gauguin&#x27;s daughter. Emile Marae a Tai, illiterate and raised in Tahiti by Pau&#x27;ura, was brought to Chicago in 1963 by the French journalist Josette Giraud and was an artist in his own right, his descendants still living in Tahiti as of 2001.

== Historical significance ==
Primitivism was an art movement of late 19th-century painting and sculpture, characterized by exaggerated body proportions, animal totems, geometric designs, and stark contrasts. The first artist to systematically use these effects and achieve broad public success was Paul Gauguin. The European cultural elite, discovering the art of Africa, Micronesia, and Native Americans for the first time, were fascinated, intrigued, and educated by the newness, wildness, and the stark power embodied in the art of those faraway places. Like Pablo Picasso in the early days of the 20th century, Gauguin was inspired and motivated by the raw power and simplicity of the so-called Primitive Art of those foreign cultures.

Gauguin is also considered a Post-Impressionist painter. His bold, colourful, and design oriented paintings significantly influenced Modern art. Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, André Derain, Fauvism, Cubism, and Orphism, among others. Later, he influenced Arthur Frank Mathews and the American Arts and Crafts movement.

John Rewald, recognized as a foremost authority on late 19th-century art, wrote a series of books about the Post-Impressionist period, including &quot;Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin&quot; (1956) and an essay, &quot;Paul Gauguin: Letters to Ambroise Vollard and André Fontainas&quot; (included in Rewald&#x27;s &quot;Studies in Post-Impressionism&quot;, 1986), discusses Gauguin&#x27;s years in Tahiti and the struggles of his survival as seen through correspondence with the art dealer Vollard and others.

== Influence on Picasso ==

Gauguin&#x27;s posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d&#x27;Automne in Paris in 1903, and an even larger one in 1906, had a stunning and powerful influence on the French avant-garde and in particular Pablo Picasso&#x27;s paintings. In the autumn of 1906, Picasso made paintings of oversized nude women and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art. Picasso&#x27;s paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin&#x27;s sculpture, painting, and his writing as well. The power evoked by Gauguin&#x27;s work led directly to &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; in 1907.

According to Gauguin biographer, David Sweetman, Picasso, as early as 1902, became a fan of Gauguin&#x27;s work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio, in Paris. Durrio had several of Gauguin&#x27;s works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin&#x27;s and an unpaid agent of his work. Durrio tried to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris. After they met, Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin&#x27;s stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces, and gave Picasso a first &quot;La Plume&quot; edition of &quot;Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin.&quot; In addition to seeing Gauguin&#x27;s work at Durrio&#x27;s, Picasso also saw the work at Ambroise Vollard&#x27;s gallery where both he and Gauguin were represented.

Concerning Gauguin&#x27;s impact on Picasso, John Richardson wrote: The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin&#x27;s work left Picasso more than ever in this artist&#x27;s thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself &#x27;Paul&#x27; in Gauguin&#x27;s honor.

Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin sculpture called &quot;Oviri&quot; (literally meaning &#x27;savage&#x27;), the gruesome phallic figure of the Tahitian goddess of life and death that was intended for Gauguin&#x27;s grave, exhibited in the 1906 retrospective exhibition that even more directly led to &quot;Les Demoiselles.&quot; Sweetman writes, &quot;Gauguin&#x27;s statue &quot;Oviri,&quot; which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso&#x27;s interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso&#x27;s art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;.&quot;

According to Richardson, Picasso&#x27;s interest in stoneware was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d&#x27;Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard&#x27;s) was the gruesome &quot;Oviri.&quot; Until 1987, when the Musée d&#x27;Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the &quot;Demoiselles.&quot; Although just under 30 inches high, &quot;Oviri&quot; has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin&#x27;s grave. Picasso was very struck by &quot;Oviri.&quot; 50 years later he was delighted when [Douglas] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso&#x27;s shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin&#x27;s role in setting him on the road to Primitivism.

== Technique and style ==
Gauguin&#x27;s initial artistic guidance was from Pissarro, but the relationship left more of a mark personally than stylistically. Gauguin&#x27;s masters were Giotto, Raphael, Ingres, Eugène Delacroix, Manet, Degas, and Cézanne. His own beliefs, and in some cases the psychology behind his work, were also influenced by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer and poet Stéphane Mallarmé.

Gauguin, like some of his contemporaries such as Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, employed a technique for painting on canvas known as &quot;peinture à l&#x27;essence&quot;. For this, the oil (binder) is drained from the paint and the remaining sludge of pigment is mixed with turpentine. He may have used a similar technique in preparing his monotypes, using paper instead of metal, as it would absorb oil giving the final images a matte appearance he desired. He also proofed some of his existing drawings with the aid of glass, copying an underneath image onto the glass surface with watercolour or gouache for printing. Gauguin&#x27;s woodcuts were no less innovative, even to the avant-garde artists responsible for the woodcut revival happening at that time. Instead of incising his blocks with the intent of making a detailed illustration, Gauguin initially chiseled his blocks in a manner similar to wood sculpture, followed by finer tools to create detail and tonality within his bold contours. Many of his tools and techniques were considered experimental. This methodology and use of space ran parallel to his painting of flat, decorative reliefs.

Starting in Martinique, Gauguin began using analogous colours in close proximity to achieve a muted effect. Shortly after this, he also made his breakthroughs in non-representational colour, creating canvases that had an independent existence and vitality all their own. This gap between surface reality and himself displeased Pissarro and quickly led to the end of their relationship. His human figures at this time are also a reminder of his love affair with Japanese prints, particularly gravitating to the naivety of their figures and compositional austerity as an influence on his primitive manifesto. For that very reason, Gauguin was also inspired by folk art. He sought out a bare emotional purity of his subjects conveyed in a straightforward way, emphasizing major forms and upright lines to clearly define shape and contour. 

Gauguin also used elaborate formal decoration and colouring in patterns of abstraction, attempting to harmonize man and nature. His depictions of the natives in their natural environment are frequently evident of serenity and a self-contained sustainability. This complemented one of Gauguin&#x27;s favorite themes, which was the intrusion of the supernatural into day-to-day life, in one instance going so far as to recall ancient Egyptian tomb reliefs with &quot;Her Name is Vairaumati&quot; and &quot;Ta Matete&quot;.

In an interview with L&#x27;Écho de Paris published on 15 March 1895, Gauguin explains that his developing tactical approach is reaching for synesthesia. He states:
:Every feature in my paintings is carefully considered and calculated in advance. Just as in a musical composition, if you like. My simple object, which I take from daily life or from nature, is merely a pretext, which helps me by the means of a definite arrangement of lines and colours to create symphonies and harmonies. They have no counterparts at all in reality, in the vulgar sense of that word; they do not give direct expression to any idea, their only purpose is to stimulate the imagination—just as music does without the aid of ideas or pictures—simply by that mysterious affinity which exists between certain arrangements of colours and lines and our minds.

In an 1888 letter to Schuffenecker, Gauguin explains the enormous step he had taken away from Impressionism and that he was now intent on capturing the soul of nature, the ancient truths and character of its scenery and inhabitants. Gauguin wrote:
:Don&#x27;t copy nature too literally. Art is an abstraction. Derive it from nature as you dream in nature&#x27;s presence, and think more about the act of creation than the outcome.

== Other media ==

Gauguin began making prints in 1889, highlighted by a series of zincographs commissioned by Theo van Gogh known as the &quot;Volpini Suite&quot;, which also appeared in the Cafe des Arts show of 1889. Gauguin was not hindered by his printing inexperience, and made a number of provocative and unorthodox choices, such as a zinc plate instead of limestone (lithography), wide margins and large sheets of yellow poster paper. The result was vivid to the point of garish, but foreshadows his more elaborate experiments with colour printing and intent to elevate monochromatic images. 

His first masterpieces of printing were from the &quot;Noa Noa Suite&quot; of 1893–94 where he was one of a number of artists reinventing the technique of the woodcut, bringing it into the modern era. He started the series shortly after returning from Tahiti, eager to reclaim a leadership position within the avant-garde and share pictures based on his French Polynesia excursion. These woodcuts were shown at his unsuccessful 1893 show at Paul Durand-Ruel&#x27;s, and most were directly related to paintings of his in which he had revised the original composition. They were shown again at a small show in his studio in 1894, where he garnered rare critical praise for his exceptional painterly and sculptural effects. Gauguin&#x27;s emerging preference for the woodcut was not only a natural extension of his wood reliefs and sculpture, but may have also been provoked by its historical significance to medieval artisans and the Japanese.

Gauguin started making watercolour monotypes in 1894, likely overlapping his &quot;Noa Noa&quot; woodcuts, perhaps even serving as a source of inspiration for them. His techniques remained innovative and it was an apt technique for him as it did not require elaborate equipment, such as a printing press. Despite often being a source of practice for related paintings, sculptures or woodcuts, his monotype innovation offers a distinctly ethereal aesthetic; ghostly afterimages that may express his desire to convey the immemorial truths of nature. His next major woodcut and monotype project was not until 1898–99, known as the &quot;Vollard Suite&quot;. He completed this enterprising series of 475 prints from some twenty different compositions and sent them to the dealer Ambroise Vollard, despite not compromising to his request for salable, conformed work. Vollard was unsatisfied and made no effort to sell them. Gauguin&#x27;s series is starkly unified with black and white aesthetic and may have intended the prints to be similar to a set of myriorama cards, in which they may be laid out in any order to create multiple panoramic landscapes. This activity of arranging and rearranging was similar to his own process of repurposing his images and motifs, as well as a symbolism tendency. He printed the work on tissue-thin Japanese paper and the multiple proofs of gray and black could be arranged on top of one another, each transparency of colour showing through to produce a rich, chiaroscuro effect.

In 1899 he started his radical experiment: oil transfer drawings. Much like his watercolour monotype technique, it was a hybrid of drawing and printmaking. The transfers were the grand culmination of his quest for an aesthetic of primordial suggestion, which seems to be relayed in his results that echo ancient rubbings, worn frescos and cave paintings. Gauguin&#x27;s technical progress from monotyping to the oil transfers is quite noticeable, advancing from small sketches to ambitiously large, highly finished sheets. With these transfers he created depth and texture by printing multiple layers onto the same sheet, beginning with graphite pencil and black ink for delineation, before moving to blue crayon to reinforce line and add shading. He would often complete the image with a wash of oiled-down olive or brown ink. The practice consumed Gauguin until his death, fueling his imagination and conception of new subjects and themes for his paintings. This collection was also sent to Vollard who remained unimpressed. 

Gauguin prized oil transfers for the way they transformed the quality of drawn line. His process, nearly alchemical in nature, had elements of chance by which unexpected marks and textures regularly arose, something that fascinated him. In metamorphosing a drawing into a print, Gauguin made a calculated decision of relinquishing legibility in order to gain mystery and abstraction.

He worked in wood throughout his career, particularly during his most prolific periods, and is known for having achieved radical carving results before doing so with painting. Even in his earliest shows, Gauguin often included wood sculpture in his display, from which he built his reputation as a connoisseur of the so-called primitive. A number of his early carvings appear to be influenced by Gothic and Egyptian art. In correspondence, he also asserts a passion for Cambodian art and the masterful colouring of Persian carpet and Oriental rug.

== Legacy ==

The vogue for Gauguin&#x27;s work started soon after his death. Many of his later paintings were acquired by the Russian collector Sergei Shchukin. A substantial part of his collection is displayed in the Pushkin Museum and the Hermitage. Gauguin paintings are rarely offered for sale, their prices reaching tens of millions of US dollars in the saleroom when they are offered. His 1892 &quot;Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?)&quot; became the world&#x27;s third-most expensive artwork when its owner, the family of Rudolf Staechelin, sold it privately for US$210 million in September 2014. The buyer is believed to be the Qatar Museums.

* Gauguin is a central and charismatic character in R.w. Meek’s award winning novels, The Dream Collector, Book I “Sabrine &amp; Sigmund Freud” and Book II “Sabrine &amp; Vincent van Gogh.”

*Gauguin&#x27;s life inspired W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;. Mario Vargas Llosa based his 2003 novel &quot;The Way to Paradise&quot; on Gauguin&#x27;s life, and that of his grandmother Flora Tristan.
*Actor Anthony Quinn portrayed Gauguin in the 1956 Van Gogh biopic &quot;Lust for Life&quot; and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Oscar Isaac played Gauguin in the later Van Gogh biopic &quot;At Eternity&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Wladimir Yordanoff played Gauguin in the 1990 film Vincent &amp; Theo.
*Gauguin is also the subject of at least two operas: Federico Elizalde&#x27;s &quot;Paul Gauguin&quot; (1943); and &quot;Gauguin (a synthetic life)&quot; by Michael Smetanin and Alison Croggon. Déodat de Séverac wrote his &quot;Elegy&quot; for piano in memory of Gauguin.
*The Danish-produced film &quot;Oviri&quot; (1986) is a biographical film. With Gauguin portrayed by Donald Sutherland, the film follows the painter from the time he returns to Paris in 1893 after a two-year stay in Tahiti and must confront his wife, his children and his former lover. It ends when he returns to Tahiti two years later. Coincidentally, Sutherland&#x27;s son Kiefer Sutherland portrayed a younger Gauguin in a less focused and much less historically accurate film &quot;Paradise Found&quot; (2003). Several other independent films have explored different aspects of Gauguin&#x27;s eventful life.
*His biography is depicted in the 2017 French film portraying his life during his years in Tahiti.

The Japanese styled Gauguin Museum, opposite the Botanical Gardens of Papeari in Papeari, Tahiti, contains some exhibits, documents, photographs, reproductions and original sketches and block prints of Gauguin and Tahitians. In 2003, the Paul Gauguin Cultural Center opened in Atuona in the Marquesas Islands.

In 2014 the painting &quot;Fruits on a Table&quot; (1889), with an estimated value of between €10m and €30m (£8.3m to £24.8m), which had been stolen in London in 1970, was discovered in Italy. The painting, together with a work by Pierre Bonnard, had been bought by a Fiat employee in 1975, at a railway lost property sale, for 45,000 lira (about £32).

=== Gauguin and colonialism ===
In the 21st century, Gauguin&#x27;s Primitivist representations of Tahiti and its people have been a subject of controversy and renewed scholarly attention. His depictions of Polynesian women have been described as &quot;racial fantasy forged from a position of patriarchal, colonialist power&quot; with some critics pointing to Gauguin&#x27;s sexual relationships with teenage Tahitian girls.

<text>Ceiba is a genus of trees in the family Malvaceae, native to tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas (from Mexico and the Caribbean to northern Argentina) and tropical West Africa. Some species can grow to tall or more, with a straight, largely branchless trunk that culminates in a huge, spreading canopy, and buttress roots that can be taller than a grown person. The best-known, and most widely cultivated, species is Kapok, &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, one of several trees known as &quot;kapok&quot;. &quot;Ceiba&quot; is a word from the Taíno language meaning &quot;boat&quot; because Taínos use the wood to build their dugout canoes.

&quot;Ceiba&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including the leaf-miner &quot;Bucculatrix ceibae&quot;, which feeds exclusively on the genus.

Recent botanical opinion incorporates &quot;Chorisia&quot; within &quot;Ceiba&quot; and puts the genus as a whole within the family Malvaceae.

==Culture and history==
The tree plays an important part in the mythologies of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. In addition, several Amazonian tribes of eastern Peru believe deities live in Ceiba tree species throughout the jungle. The Ceiba, or ya’axché (in the Mopan Mayan language), symbolised to the Maya civilization an axis mundi which connects the planes of the Underworld (Xibalba) and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm. This concept of a central world tree is often depicted as a Ceiba trunk. The unmistakable thick conical thorns in clusters on the trunk were reproduced by the southern lowland Maya of the Classical Period on cylindrical ceramic burial urns or incense holders.
Modern Maya still often respectfully leave the tree standing when harvesting forest timber. The Ceiba tree is represented by a cross and serves as an important architectural motif in the Temple of the Cross Complex at Palenque.

Ceiba Tree Park is located in San Antón, in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Its centerpiece is the historic Ceiba de Ponce, a 500-year-old &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; tree associated with the founding of the city. In the surroundings of the legendary Ceiba de Ponce, broken pieces of indigenous pottery, shells, and stones were found to confirm the presence of Taino Indians long before the Spaniards that later settled in the area. In 1525, Spanish Conquistador Hernán Cortés ordered the hanging of Aztec emperor Cuauhtemoc from a &quot;Ceiba&quot; tree after overtaking his empire. The town of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico was founded in 1528 by the Spanish around La Pochota, &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, according to tradition. Founded in 1838, the Puerto Rican town of Ceiba is also named after this tree. The Honduran city of La Ceiba founded in 1877 was named after a particular &quot;Ceiba&quot; tree that grew down by the old docks. In 1898, the Spanish Army in Cuba surrendered to the United States under a &quot;Ceiba&quot;, which was named the Santiago Surrender Tree, outside of Santiago de Cuba.

&quot;Ceiba&quot; is also the national tree of Guatemala. The most important Ceiba in Guatemala is known as La Ceiba de Palín Escuintla which is over 400 years old. In Caracas, Venezuela there is a 100-year-old ceiba tree in front of the San Francisco Church known as La Ceiba de San Francisco and is an important element in the history of the city. The towering specimen near the town of Sabalito, Costa Rica, is a relict tree called &quot;la ceiba&quot; by residents and a survivor of one of the highest terrestrial rates of tropical deforestation.

&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; produces a light and strong fiber (kapok) used throughout history to fill mattresses, pillows, tapestries, and dolls. Kapok has recently been replaced in commercial use by synthetic fibers. The Ceiba tree seed is used to extract oils used to make soap and fertilizers. The Ceiba continues to be commercialized in Asia, especially in Java, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.

&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; is the central theme in the book titled, The Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry. &quot;Ceiba insignis&quot; and &quot;Ceiba speciosa&quot; are added to some versions of the hallucinogenic drink Ayahuasca.

Pablo Antonio Cuadra, a Nicaraguan poet, wrote a chapter about the Ceiba tree. He used it as a symbol of the Nicaraguan ancestral roots, a cradle for the nation, and source during the people&#x27;s exile.

<text>A world file is a six line plain text sidecar file used by geographic information systems (GIS) to georeference raster map images. The file specification was introduced by Esri.

==Definition==

The generic meaning of the six parameters in a world file (as defined by Esri) is:

*Line 1: &quot;A&quot;: pixel size in the &quot;x&quot;-direction in map units/pixel
*Line 2: &quot;D&quot;: rotation about &quot;y&quot;-axis
*Line 3: &quot;B&quot;: rotation about &quot;x&quot;-axis
*Line 4: &quot;E&quot;: pixel size in the &quot;y&quot;-direction in map units, almost always negative
*Line 5: &quot;C&quot;: &quot;x&quot;-coordinate of the center of the upper left pixel
*Line 6: &quot;F&quot;: &quot;y&quot;-coordinate of the center of the upper left pixel

This description is however misleading in that the &quot;D&quot; and &quot;B&quot; parameters are not angular rotations, and that the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;E&quot; parameters do not correspond to the pixel size if &quot;D&quot; or &quot;B&quot; are not zero. The &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;E&quot; parameters are sometimes named &quot;x-scale&quot;, &quot;y-skew&quot;, &quot;x-skew&quot; and &quot;y-scale&quot;.

A better description of the &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;E&quot; parameters is:

*Line 1: &quot;A&quot;: &quot;x&quot;-component of the pixel width (&quot;x&quot;-scale)
*Line 2: &quot;D&quot;: &quot;y&quot;-component of the pixel width (&quot;y&quot;-skew)
*Line 3: &quot;B&quot;: &quot;x&quot;-component of the pixel height (&quot;x&quot;-skew)
*Line 4: &quot;E&quot;: &quot;y&quot;-component of the pixel height (&quot;y&quot;-scale), typically negative
*Line 5: &quot;C&quot;: &quot;x&quot;-coordinate of the center of the original image&#x27;s upper left pixel transformed to the map
*Line 6: &quot;F&quot;: &quot;y&quot;-coordinate of the center of the original image&#x27;s upper left pixel transformed to the map

All four parameters are expressed in the map units, which are described by the spatial reference system for the raster.

When &quot;D&quot; or &quot;B&quot; are non-zero the pixel width is given by:
:formula_1

and the pixel height by
:formula_2

World files describing a map on the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system (UTM) use these conventions:
*&quot;D&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are usually 0, since the image pixels are usually made to align with the UTM grid
*&quot;C&quot; is the UTM easting
*&quot;F&quot; is the UTM northing
*Units are always meters per pixel

The above description applies also to a rectangular, non-rotated image which might be, for example, overlaid on an orthogonally projected map. If the world file describes an image that is rotated from the axis of the target projection, however, then A, D, B and E must be derived from the required affine transformation (see below). Specifically, A and E will no longer be the meter/pixel measurement on their respective axes.

These values are used in a six-parameter affine transformation:

:formula_3
which can be written as this set of equations:

:formula_4
where:

:&quot;x&quot;&#x27; is the calculated UTM easting of the pixel on the map
:&quot;y&quot;&#x27; is the calculated UTM northing of the pixel on the map
:&quot;x&quot; is the column number of the pixel in the image counting from left
:&quot;y&quot; is the row number of the pixel in the image counting from top
:&quot;A&quot; or &quot;x&quot;-scale; dimension of a pixel in map units in &quot;x&quot;-direction
:&quot;B&quot;, &quot;D&quot; are rotation terms
:&quot;C&quot;, &quot;F&quot; are translation terms: &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; map coordinates of the center of the upper-left pixel
:&quot;E&quot; is negative of &quot;y&quot;-scale: dimension of a pixel in map units in &quot;y&quot;-direction

The &quot;y&quot;-scale (&quot;E&quot;) is negative because the origins of an image and the UTM coordinate system are different. The origin of an image is located in the upper-left corner, whereas the origin of the map coordinate system is located in the lower-left corner. Row values in the image increase from the origin downward, while &quot;y&quot;-coordinate values in the map increase from the origin upward. Many mapping programs are unable to handle &quot;upside down&quot; images (i.e. those with a positive &quot;y&quot;-scale).

To go from UTM(x&#x27;y&#x27;) to pixel position(x,y) one can use the equation:

:formula_5

Example:
Original codice_1 is 800×600 pixels (map not shown).
Its world file is codice_2 and contains:

 32.0
 0.0
 0.0
 -32.0
 691200.0
 4576000.0
The position of Falkner Island light on the map image is:
 x = 171 pixels from left
 y = 343 pixels from top

This gives:
 x1 = 696672 meters Easting
 y1 = 4565024 meters Northing

The UTM (grid) zone is not given so the coordinates are ambiguous — they can represent a position in any of the approximately 120 UTM grid zones. In this case, approximate latitude and longitude (41.2, −072.7) were looked up in a gazetteer and the UTM (grid) zone was found to be 18 using a Web-based converter.

==Filename extension==
The base filename of a world file matches the raster&#x27;s base filename, but has a different filename extension (suffix). There are three filename extension naming conventions used for world files, with variable support across software.

One simple convention with widespread support is to append the letter &quot;w&quot; to the end of the raster filename. For example, a raster named should have a world file named .

An alternative file naming convention that uses a three-character extension to conform to the 8.3 file naming convention uses the first and last character of the raster file&#x27;s extension, followed by &quot;w&quot; at the end. For example, here are a few naming conventions for popular raster formats:
A third convention is to use a file extension, irrespective of the type of raster file, as supported by GDAL and QGIS, but not Esri.

==Localization==
When writing world files it is advisable to ignore localization settings and always use &quot;.&quot; as the decimal separator. Also, negative numbers should be specified with the &quot;-&quot; character exclusively. This ensures maximum portability of the images.

<text>The Freising manuscripts are the first Latin-script continuous text in a Slavic language and the oldest document in Slovene.

==Description and origin==
The manuscripts were found bound into a Latin codex (manuscript book). Four parchment leaves and a further quarter of a page have been preserved (i.e., folia 78, 158, 159, 160, and 161, comprising nine pages altogether). They consist of three texts in the oldest Slovene dialect. Linguistic, stylistic and contextual analyses reveal that these are church texts of careful composition and literary form.

The precise date of the origin of the Freising manuscripts cannot be exactly determined; the original text was probably written in the 9th century. In this liturgic and homiletic manuscript, three Slovene records were found and this miscellany was probably an episcopal manual (pontificals). The Freising manuscripts in it were created between 972 and 1039, most likely before 1000. The main support for this dating is the writing, which was used in the centuries after Charlemagne and is named Carolingian minuscule.

During the time of the writing of the two manuscripts (sermons on sin and repentance, a confessional form), Bishop Abraham was active (from 957 to 994) in Freising. It is believed that the manuscripts were written in the Möll Valley in Carinthia. For this reason some linguists (e.g. Jernej Kopitar and Rajko Nahtigal) linked Abraham closely to the origin of the Freising manuscripts and even attributed to him the authorship of one of the texts and suspected that he was of Slovene origin, although this was later disproven.

==Modern history==
The manuscripts were discovered in Freising, Bavaria. The Slovene name &quot;Brižinski spomeniki&quot; (literally &#x27;Brižinj Monuments&#x27;) was coined by the Carinthian Slovene philologist Anton Janežič, who Slovenized the German name Freising to &quot;Brižinj&quot; in 1854. In 1803, the manuscript came to the Bavarian State Library in Munich and the Freising manuscripts were discovered there in 1807. The texts were translated into modern Slovene in 1854 by Anton Janežič. Before World War II, a facsimile of the Freising manuscripts was published by at &quot;Akademska založba&quot; (Academic Publisher) in Ljubljana.

==Exhibitions==
The manuscripts are still kept at the Bavarian State Library in Munich and have left it only twice. In the 1970s, they were exhibited in the Vatican Museums. In May and June 2004, they were exhibited at the National and University Library in Ljubljana.

<text>K Rock 95.5 (call sign: 3CAT; stylised as K rock 95.5) is a commercial FM radio station based in Geelong, Australia. K Rock operates a mainstream Top 40 playlist and also airs Australian Football League matches involving the Geelong Football Club.

K Rock shares transmitter facilities with sister station 93.9 Bay FM (along with 94.7 The Pulse and 96.3 Rhema FM), broadcasting from a transmitter on top of Murradoc Hill on the Bellarine Peninsula. The license area covers the Greater Geelong area, Werribee and Western Melbourne, The Golden Plains, and the Surf Coast. K Rock also streams online via their website.

==History==
===3GL===
From 1930 to 1990, K Rock was known as 3GL on the AM band, broadcasting first on 1400 kHz, then 1350 kHz and later 1341 kHz. Although based in Geelong, it was notable for being received over most of the Melbourne metropolitan area. 

3GL gave Happy Hammond his start in broadcasting in 1948 as a breakfast announcer. While at 3GL, Hammond also made his first TV appearance in 1948, long before the Tarax Show, as part of an exhibition using closed-circuit TV equipment for trial purposes. Towards the end of its time as an AM station, 3GL used the &quot;3GL on the West Coast&quot; slogan and associated jingles, many sung by Mike Brady.

For many years, 3GL was based in James Street, Geelong, but relocated after being granted the right to convert to the FM band in 1990.

3GL was offered an FM conversion upon the entry to the Geelong market of competitor BAY FM in December 1989. 3GL converted to FM to allow equal competition in the Geelong regional market, with the management of the former Geelong AM service agreeing to transfer the service to the FM band in 1990. The station was going to drop the 3GL call sign in favour of 3CAT (after the Geelong Cats), as proposed by the radio station&#x27;s head of football commentary Ted Whitten (who at the time was in the early stages of his battle with cancer). However, the official call sign, 3CAT-FM has never been used on-air. Instead, a decision was made to adopt the moniker K-Rock for the station&#x27;s commencement on the FM band at 95.5 MHz, on 27 January 1990.

The callsign 3GL has been reactivated with a &quot;Classic hits&quot; format on the original 1341 AM frequency. Test transmissions commenced intermittently in December 2023, using the station ID sweepers from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s &quot;West Coast&#x27;s 3GL 1341&quot; and &quot;Classic Hits 3GL Geelong&quot;, then continuously from New Years Day 2024. The station officially relaunched on 1 April 2024 under the slogan &quot;Hits and Memories&quot;.

===K Rock===
After simulcasting on both 1341 AM and 95.5 FM for two weeks, K Rock went to air at midday on the Saturday of the Australia Day weekend 1990, the first announcer to speak on the new FM station was Ian &#x27;Strawny&#x27; Strachan.

K Rock was also among the first commercial FM stations to cover AFL football, along with 3KKZ (KZFM) the same year. The lineup included Ted Whitten, Sam Kekovich, Billy Brownless and Dwayne Russell, K Rock continues to focus on Geelong Football Club matches.

Originally owned by Hoyts, which operated Triple M brand in Australia, K Rock was sold to Grant Broadcasters in the mid-1990s. Shortly after this, the station purchased the rival Geelong station, 93.9 Bay FM, moving it from its Ryrie Street studios to co-locate in the K Rock studios in Moorabool Street, Geelong. Both K Rock and Bay FM now operate from the same studios in Geelong&#x27;s CBD.

In 2007, K Rock celebrated 75 years of broadcasting 3GL and K Rock Footy, culminating in a week of broadcasting at various events as the city celebrated the first AFL Premiership victory by the Geelong Football Club in 44 years.

In 2010, K Rock underwent a major format change which re-focused the music toward a younger audience and minimised the station&#x27;s traditional rock base. In later years, K Rock would take the ARN Regional music log, which is heard on ARN&#x27;s regional stations including Power FM 103.1.

== K Rock Football ==
K Rock only commentates on every home and away and finals matches involving the Geelong Cats plus most other finals including the Grand Final from Melbourne. The station also covers the match of the round from the Geelong Football Netball League.

<doc id="64740" wikidata="Q122392" url="?curid=64740" title="Jacob Bernoulli">
<text>Jacob Bernoulli (also known as James in English or Jacques in French; – 16 August 1705) was a Swiss mathematician. He sided with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz during the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy and was an early proponent of Leibnizian calculus, to which he made numerous contributions. As a member of the Bernoulli family, he, along with his brother Johann, was one of the founders of the calculus of variations. He also discovered the fundamental mathematical constant . However, his most important contribution was in the field of probability, where he derived the first version of the law of large numbers in his work &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot;.

==Biography==
Jakob Bernoulli, born in Basel in the Swiss Confederation, was the son and grandson of protestant spice merchants on his fathers side, his mother was born into a family engaged in banking and city governing. 

Following his father&#x27;s wish, he studied theology and entered the ministry. But contrary to the desires of his parents, he also studied mathematics and astronomy. He traveled throughout Europe from 1676 to 1682, learning about the latest discoveries in mathematics and the sciences under leading figures of the time. This included the work of Johannes Hudde, Robert Boyle, and Robert Hooke. During this time he also produced an incorrect theory of comets.
Bernoulli returned to Switzerland, and began teaching mechanics at the University of Basel from 1683. His doctoral dissertation &quot;Solutionem tergemini problematis&quot; was submitted in 1684. It appeared in print in 1687.

In 1684, Bernoulli married Judith Stupanus; they had two children. During this decade, he also began a fertile research career. His travels allowed him to establish correspondence with many leading mathematicians and scientists of his era, which he maintained throughout his life. During this time, he studied the new discoveries in mathematics, including Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s &quot;De ratiociniis in aleae ludo&quot;, Descartes&#x27; &quot;La Géométrie&quot; and Frans van Schooten&#x27;s supplements of it. He also studied Isaac Barrow and John Wallis, leading to his interest in infinitesimal geometry. Apart from these, it was between 1684 and 1689 that many of the results that were to make up &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot; were discovered.

People believe he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Basel in 1687, remaining in this position for the rest of his life. By that time, he had begun tutoring his brother Johann Bernoulli on mathematical topics. The two brothers began to study the calculus as presented by Leibniz in his 1684 paper on the differential calculus in &quot;Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis&quot; published in &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot;. They also studied the publications of von Tschirnhaus. It must be understood that Leibniz&#x27;s publications on the calculus were very obscure to mathematicians of that time and the Bernoullis were among the first to try to understand and apply Leibniz&#x27;s theories.

Jacob collaborated with his brother on various applications of calculus. However the atmosphere of collaboration between the two brothers turned into rivalry as Johann&#x27;s own mathematical genius began to mature, with both of them attacking each other in print, and posing difficult mathematical challenges to test each other&#x27;s skills. By 1697, the relationship had completely broken down.

The lunar crater Bernoulli is also named after him jointly with his brother Johann.

==Important works==
Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s first important contributions were a pamphlet on the parallels of logic and algebra published in 1685, work on probability in 1685 and geometry in 1687. His geometry result gave a construction to divide any triangle into four equal parts with two perpendicular lines.

By 1689, he had published important work on infinite series and published his law of large numbers in probability theory. Jacob Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between 1682 and 1704. The first two of these contained many results, such as the fundamental result that formula_1 diverges, which Bernoulli believed were new but they had actually been proved by Pietro Mengoli 40 years earlier and was proved by Nicole Oresme in the 14th century already. Bernoulli could not find a closed form for formula_2, but he did show that it converged to a finite limit less than 2. Euler was the first to find the limit of this series in 1737. Bernoulli also studied the exponential series which came out of examining compound interest.

In May 1690, in a paper published in &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot;, Jacob Bernoulli showed that the problem of determining the isochrone is equivalent to solving a first-order nonlinear differential equation. The isochrone, or curve of constant descent, is the curve along which a particle will descend under gravity from any point to the bottom in exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. It had been studied by Huygens in 1687 and Leibniz in 1689. After finding the differential equation, Bernoulli then solved it by what we now call separation of variables. Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s paper of 1690 is important for the history of calculus, since the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning. In 1696, Bernoulli solved the equation, now called the Bernoulli differential equation,

:formula_3

Jacob Bernoulli also discovered a general method to determine evolutes of a curve as the envelope of its circles of curvature. He also investigated caustic curves and in particular he studied these associated curves of the parabola, the logarithmic spiral and epicycloids around 1692. The lemniscate of Bernoulli was first conceived by Jacob Bernoulli in 1694. In 1695, he investigated the drawbridge problem which seeks the curve required so that a weight sliding along the cable always keeps the drawbridge balanced.
Bernoulli&#x27;s most original work was &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot;, published in Basel in 1713, eight years after his death. The work was incomplete at the time of his death but it is still a work of the greatest significance in the theory of probability. The book also covers other related subjects, including a review of combinatorics, in particular the work of van Schooten, Leibniz, and Prestet, as well as the use of Bernoulli numbers in a discussion of the exponential series. Inspired by Huygens&#x27; work, Bernoulli also gives many examples on how much one would expect to win playing various games of chance. The term Bernoulli trial resulted from this work.

In the last part of the book, Bernoulli sketches many areas of mathematical probability, including probability as a measurable degree of certainty; necessity and chance; moral versus mathematical expectation; a priori an a posteriori probability; expectation of winning when players are divided according to dexterity; regard of all available arguments, their valuation, and their calculable evaluation; and the law of large numbers.

Bernoulli was one of the most significant promoters of the formal methods of higher analysis. Astuteness and elegance are seldom found in his method of presentation and expression, but there is a maximum of integrity.

==Discovery of the mathematical constant &quot;e&quot;==
In 1683, Bernoulli discovered the constant by studying a question about compound interest which required him to find the value of the following expression (which is in fact ):

:formula_4

One example is an account that starts with $1.00 and pays 100 percent interest per year. If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value is $2.00; but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year, the $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00×1.52 = $2.25. Compounding quarterly yields $1.00×1.254 = $2.4414..., and compounding monthly yields $1.00×(1.0833...)12 = $2.613035...

Bernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) for more and smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly yields $2.692597..., while compounding daily yields $2.714567..., just two cents more. Using as the number of compounding intervals, with interest of 100% / in each interval, the limit for large is the number that Euler later named ; with &quot;continuous&quot; compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818... More generally, an account that starts at $1, and yields (1+) dollars at compound interest, will yield dollars with continuous compounding.

==Tombstone==

Bernoulli wanted a logarithmic spiral and the motto &quot;Eadem mutata resurgo&quot; (&#x27;Although changed, I rise again the same&#x27;) engraved on his tombstone. He wrote that the self-similar spiral &quot;may be used as a symbol, either of fortitude and constancy in adversity, or of the human body, which after all its changes, even after death, will be restored to its exact and perfect self&quot;. Bernoulli died in 1705, but an Archimedean spiral was engraved rather than a logarithmic one.

<doc id="64746" wikidata="Q1968845" url="?curid=64746" title="Stanley Lord">
<text>Stanley Phillip Lord (13 September 1877 – 24 January 1962) was the British captain of the SS &quot;Californian&quot;, the nearest ship to the &quot;Titanic&quot; on the night she sank on 15 April 1912, and, depending on which sources are believed, likely the only ship to see the &quot;Titanic&quot;, or at least her rockets (also known as flares), during the sinking. 

Lord, and the &quot;Californian&quot; more generally, have been criticised for the fact that the &quot;Californian&quot; did not render timely assistance to the &quot;Titanic&quot; despite being between 5 and 20 miles away, according to the testimony of various witnesses, and the only ship that could have reached &quot;Titanic&quot; before she sank. Two official inquiries were critical of Lord, but did not recommend criminal charges. Subsequent authors have offered differing opinions on Lord&#x27;s actions, with some defending, and others criticising him. The passion among the two factions has resulted in the labels of &quot;Lordites&quot; and &quot;Anti-Lordites&quot; being applied to the two camps. 

Central points of debate typically include the appropriateness of Lord&#x27;s response to the rockets, whether the &quot;Californian&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; were in fact visible to one another (and additionally the visibility of the rockets), the possible presence of one or more &quot;Mystery Ships&quot; that may have been the ships seen by either the &quot;Titanic&quot; or &quot;Californian&quot; (assuming they did not in fact see each other), and whether or not the &quot;Californian&quot; could have saved any additional lives had it attempted to render assistance more quickly.

== Early life ==
Lord was born on 13 September 1877 in Bolton, Lancashire, England. He began his training at sea when he was thirteen, aboard the barque &quot;Naiad&quot;, in March 1891. He later obtained his Second Mate’s Certificate of competency and served as Second Officer on the barque &quot;Lurlei&quot;.

In February 1901, at the age of 23, Lord obtained his Master&#x27;s Certificate, and three months later, obtained his Extra Master&#x27;s Certificate. He entered the service of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1897. The company was taken over by the Leyland Line in 1900, but Lord continued service with the new company, and was awarded his first command in 1906.

Lord was given command of the &quot;SS Californian&quot; in 1911.

== Personal life ==
Lord was married and had a son. His wife, Mabel, died in 1957, and Lord died in 1962. Their son, Stanley Tutton Lord (1908–1994), worked as a banker in Liverpool; he never married or had children. He lived as a bachelor until his death from natural causes in 1994. He rarely spoke of his father, except to say he believed in his innocence. In 1965 he wrote a preface to a book by Peter Padfield, &quot;The Titanic and the Californian&quot;, which supported the case for Lord having been judged unfairly.

==&quot;Titanic&quot; sinking ==
=== Before the sinking ===
On the night of 14 April 1912, as the &quot;Californian&quot; approached a large ice field, Captain Lord decided to stop around 10:21 p.m. (ship&#x27;s time) and wait out the night. Before turning in for the night, he ordered his sole wireless operator, Cyril Evans, to warn other ships in the area about the ice. When reaching the &quot;Titanic&quot;, Evans tapped out &quot;I say old man, we are stopped and surrounded by ice.&quot; The &quot;Californian&quot; was so close to the &quot;Titanic&quot; that the message was very loud in the ears of &quot;Titanic&quot; First Wireless Operator Jack Phillips, who promptly responded &quot;Keep out! Shut up! I am working [&quot;i.e.&quot;, communicating with] Cape Race.&quot;

Earlier in the day the wireless equipment aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot; had broken down and Phillips, along with Second Wireless Operator Harold Bride, had spent the better part of the day trying to repair it. Now they were swamped with outgoing messages that had piled up during the day and Phillips was exhausted after such a long day. Additionally, they had already received several ice warnings and passed them onto the bridge, including an earlier one from &quot;Californian&quot;. Hence, this message was not news to him. Evans listened in for a while longer as Phillips sent routine traffic reports through the Cape Race relaying station before finally turning in for bed at around 11:30 p.m.

=== Night of &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking ===
Over the course of the night, officers and seamen on the deck of &quot;Californian&quot; witnessed eight white rockets fired into the air over a strange ship off in the distance.

Fatigued after 17 hours on duty, Captain Stanley Lord was awakened twice during the night and told about the rockets, to which he replied that they may be &quot;company rockets&quot;, to help ships identify themselves to liners of the same company.

Meanwhile, on the &quot;Titanic&quot;, for an hour after the collision, no other ships were noticed until the lights of a ship were seen in the distance. Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe tried in vain to contact the strange ship by Morse lamp. Nobody on the deck of the &quot;Californian&quot; saw these signals; however, they had also tried to signal the mystery ship, but were unable to get a response.

Authors Tim Maltin and Eloise Aston attribute Captain Lord&#x27;s belief that the nearby ship was not the &quot;Titanic&quot; to visual distortions caused by cold-water mirages. Not able to understand any messages coming from the strange ship, &quot;Californian&quot;&#x27;s officers eventually concluded that signals were merely the masthead flickering and not signals at all.

Throughout the night, no one on board the &quot;Californian&quot; attempted to wake their wireless operator, and ask him to contact the ship to ask why they were firing rockets and trying to signal them, until 5:30 a.m. By then, however, it was too late — the &quot;Titanic&quot; had gone down at 2:20 a.m. When she had slipped below the water, the sudden disappearance of lights was interpreted by the &quot;Californian&quot; crew to mean that she had simply steamed away.

=== Search and recovery ===
On the morning of 15 April 1912, Captain Lord was notified by the &quot;Frankfurt&quot; that the &quot;Titanic&quot; had gone down early that morning. At 8:45 a.m, the &quot;Californian&quot; pulled up alongside the &quot;Carpathia&quot; and stayed behind to search for additional bodies after the &quot;Carpathia&quot; steamed towards New York.

=== Lord&#x27;s testimony ===
The following is from Captain Lord&#x27;s testimony in the US Inquiry on 26 April:

Lord made no effort to awaken the wireless operator and send a message that way, which might have been far more effective in obtaining information from the Titanic.

== Reputation ==
While Lord was never tried or convicted of any offence, he was still viewed publicly as a pariah after the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. His attempts to fight for his exoneration gained him nothing, and the events of the night of 14–15 April 1912 would haunt him for the rest of his life.

Lord was dismissed by the Leyland Line in August 1912. So far as any negligence of the SS &quot;Californian&quot;&#x27;s officers and crew was concerned, the conclusions of both the American and British inquiries seemed to disapprove of Lord&#x27;s actions but stopped short of recommending charges. While both inquiries censured Lord, they did not make any recommendations for an official investigation to ascertain if he was guilty of offences under the Merchant Shipping Acts. Lord was not allowed to be represented at either the U.S. or British inquiry.

In February 1913, with help from a Leyland director who believed he had been unfairly treated, Lord was hired by the Nitrate Producers Steamship Co., where he remained until March 1927, resigning for health reasons. In 1958, Lord contacted the Mercantile Marine Service Association in Liverpool to clear his name. The association&#x27;s general secretary, Mr. Leslie Harrison, took up the case for him and petitioned the Board of Trade on his behalf for a re-examination of the facts, but there had been no finding by the time of Lord&#x27;s death in 1962. In 1965, largely because Lord had offered no new evidence, his petition was rejected, but in the same year Peter Padfield&#x27;s book &quot;The Titanic and the Californian&quot; was published, defending Lord&#x27;s reputation, with a preface by his son Stanley Tutton Lord. This was followed by a second petition, in 1968, which was also rejected.

In 1957, Lord&#x27;s wife died. It was a devastating loss to him and precipitated a decline in his health. In 1958 the film &quot;A Night To Remember&quot; was released, based on a 1955 book of the same title by Walter Lord (no relation). Stanley Lord, now 81 years old, never saw the film, but purportedly read the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; newspaper reviews of the film. Lord was very disappointed, and it brought back memories of the &quot;Titanic&quot; tragedy, and was upset over his negative portrayal by the Australian-British actor Russell Napier, which depicted him as a captain in his forties, in a warm cabin in bed asleep when &quot;Titanic&quot; was sinking. In reality, Lord was 34 years old at the time and was asleep in the chart room with his uniform on at the time of the disaster. Lord&#x27;s son Stanley Tutton Lord saw the film and was upset about how his father was treated after the &quot;Titanic&quot; tragedy. In 1959 Stanley helped fight to get his father&#x27;s name cleared from the records of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. He continued his attempts after his father died in 1962, up until he died in 1994. Stanley Tutton Lord was seen in an interview from &quot;Titanic&quot;: The Legend Lives On, part 2 of documentary in 1994 just before his death. Stanley Tutton was only 4 years old when the Titanic tragedy happened, and he told stories about how his father&#x27;s life was affected by the tragedy up to when the 1958 Hollywood film was released in theaters. In 1996 just two years after Stanley Tutton passed away the TV series Titanic was released on TV. It had a scene of the Californian ship that had stopped for the night, because of field ice. The crew on board the Californian saw a passenger ship that had also stopped from the ice. The Californian crew called Captain Lord on the phone and told him about a ship that had stopped for the night, and had also tried Morse lamping the ship to know who it was. Captain Lord in the low-budget TV series was depicted in his late 60s and was sleeping in his cabin just like in the 1958 film A Night To Remember 38 years earlier.

The discovery in 1985 of the remains of the &quot;Titanic&quot; on the sea bed made it clear that the S.O.S. position given after the iceberg collision by the &quot;Titanic&#x27;s&quot; fourth officer, Joseph Boxhall, was wrong by thirteen miles. At both of the 1912 inquiries, there had been some conflict about the true position of the ship when it sank. The conclusions of the inquiries discounted the evidence of uncertainty about the position of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. At the time, some assumed that the position that Lord had given for his ship was incorrect and that he was much closer to the &quot;Titanic&quot; than he claimed to be. While the entries in the &quot;Californian&quot;&#x27;s scrap log (used for recording information before it was written up officially in the ship&#x27;s logbook) referring to the night in question had mysteriously gone missing, sometimes seen as overwhelming proof that Lord deliberately destroyed evidence to cover his crime of ignoring a distress call, destroying the scrap log records was normal company practice. While modifying the official ship&#x27;s log or removing pages is a serious violation of maritime law, this was not the case. A re-appraisal by the British government, instigated informally in 1988 and published in 1992 by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), further implicated the consequences of Lord&#x27;s inaction. Among its conclusions were that although the &quot;Californian&quot; was probably out of visual sight, the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s rockets had been sighted by the &quot;Californian&quot;″s crew. Another conclusion stated that it was unrealistic to assume that Lord could have rushed towards the signals and that with the &quot;Titanic&quot; reporting an incorrect position, the &quot;Californian&quot; would have arrived at about the same time as the &quot;Carpathia&quot; and fulfilled a similar role – rescuing those who had escaped. The report was critical of the behavior of the other officers of the &quot;Californian&quot; in reaction to the signals. What has never been satisfactorily resolved was why Lord did not simply wake his radio operator and listen for any distress signals.

Daniel Allen Butler, in his 2009 book &quot;The Other Side of Night: The Carpathia, the Californian, and the Night Titanic Was Lost&quot;, makes a case that Lord&#x27;s personality and temperament — his behaviour at both inquiries, his threats towards his crew, his frequent changing of his story, the absence of the scrap log, and odd remarks made by Lord in Boston in a newspaper interview – point to Lord&#x27;s having some sort of mental illness. His lack of compassion — never once expressing grief at the loss of the &quot;Titanic&quot; or sorrow for those who had lost family when she sank is, according to Butler, compatible with sociopathy. 

Captain Lord died on 24 January 1962, aged 84, almost half a century after the sinking of the &quot; Titanic&quot;. He is buried in Rake Lane Cemetery Wallasey.

<text>Alva Myrdal ( , ; née Reimer; 31 January 1902 – 1 February 1986) was a Swedish sociologist, diplomat and politician. She was a prominent leader of the disarmament movement. She, along with Alfonso García Robles, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982. She married Gunnar Myrdal in 1924; he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1974, making them the fourth ever married couple to have won Nobel Prizes, and the first to win independent of each other (versus a shared Nobel Prize by scientist spouses).

==Biography==

=== Early life and studies ===
Alva Myrdal was born in Uppsala and grew up as the first child of a modest family, the daughter of Albert Reimer and Lowa Jonsson. She had four siblings: Ruth (1904–1980), Folke (1906–1977), May (1909–1941) and Stig (1912–1977). Her father was a socialist and modern liberal. During her childhood the family moved around to different places. For example, they were residents of Eskilstuna, Älvsjö, and Stockholm. Her academic studies involved psychology and family sociology. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Stockholm in 1924.

In 1929, Myrdal and her husband Gunnar Myrdal had the opportunity to travel to the US as Rockefeller Fellows. Myrdal further deepened her studies in the fields of psychology, education and sociology whilst in the US. She had the special chance to broaden her knowledge of children&#x27;s education. Myrdal&#x27;s observation of the great social and economic disparities in the United States also led to an increased political commitment – &quot;radical&quot; was the term that she and her husband came to use to describe their shared political outlook They then moved to Geneva for further studies, where they started to so study the population decline that worried many Europeans during the interwar period.

=== Politics of the family and population issue ===
Myrdal first came to public attention in the 1930s, and was one of the main driving forces in the creation of the Swedish welfare state. She coauthored the book &quot;Crisis in the Population Question&quot; ( with Gunnar Myrdal in 1934). The basic premise of &quot;Crisis in the Population Question&quot; is to find what social reforms are needed to allow for individual liberty (especially for women) while also promoting child-bearing, and encouraging Swedes to have children. The book also detailed the importance of shared responsibility for children&#x27;s education both between the parents as well as the community by trained child educators.

Myrdal was highly critical of developments in the operation of preschools for children in Sweden. Consequently, she published the book &quot;Urban Children&quot; (1935), where she presented her ideas for a newly reformed Swedish preschool system. She argued that contemporary child care was flawed. The system was polarized between two extremes – measures of &#x27;poor relief&#x27; for the less well-off contrasted with those measures which prepared children from wealthier families for private schools. She stressed that there were material obstacles in the way of being able to access a good education. Therefore, social and economic reforms were needed. Myrdal wanted to combine and integrate the two extremes.

A year later, she was able to put her theory into practice, as she became director of the National Educational Seminar, which she cofounded in 1936. She personally worked there as a teacher and pedagogue by training preschool teachers. Myrdal emphasized the lack of recent educational research in regards to preschool teacher training. Her teaching tried to integrate the new discoveries in child psychology in education. Social studies were also emphasized, as was women&#x27;s personal development.

With architect Sven Markelius, Myrdal designed Stockholm&#x27;s cooperative &quot;Collective House&quot; in 1937, with an eye towards developing more domestic liberty for women. She was a member of the Committee for Increased Women&#x27;s Representation, founded in 1937 to increase women&#x27;s political representation.

In 1938, Alva and Gunnar Myrdal moved to the United States. While in the US, Myrdal published the book &quot;Nation and Family&quot; (1941) concerning the Swedish family unit and population policy. During World War II, she also periodically lived in Sweden.

=== Postwar career takeoff ===
A long-time prominent member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, in the late 1940s she became involved in international issues with the United Nations, appointed to head its section on welfare policy in 1949. From 1950 to 1955 she was chairman of UNESCO&#x27;s social science section—the first woman to hold such prominent positions in the UN. In 1955–1956, she served as a Swedish envoy to New Delhi, India, Yangon, Myanmar and Colombo, Sri Lanka.

From 1951 she had collaborated with British-based sociologist Viola Klein and in 1958 they co-wrote the book &quot;Women&#x27;s Two Roles: Home and Work&quot;, supported by the International Federation of University Women &quot;to make an international survey of the needs for social reforms if women are to be put into a position to reconcile family and professional life&quot;.

In 1962, Myrdal was elected to the Riksdag, and in 1962 she was sent as the Swedish delegate to the UN disarmament conference in Geneva, a role she kept until 1973. During the negotiations in Geneva, she played an extremely active role, emerging as the leader of the group of nonaligned nations which endeavored to bring pressure to bear on the two superpowers (US and USSR, respectively) to show greater concern for concrete disarmament measures. Her experiences from the years spent in Geneva found an outlet in her book &quot;The game of disarmament&quot;, in which she expresses her disappointment at the reluctance of the US and the USSR to disarm.

Myrdal participated in the creation of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, becoming the first chairman of the governing board in 1966. In 1967 she was also named consultative Cabinet minister for disarmament, an office she held until 1973. Myrdal also wrote the acclaimed book &quot;The Game of Disarmament,&quot; originally published in 1976. A vocal supporter of disarmament, Myrdal received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982 together with Alfonso García Robles. In 1983 Myrdal effectively ended the heated controversy over the future of Adolf Fredrik&#x27;s Music School, &quot;The AF-fight&quot; (Swedish: AF-striden).

Myrdal promoted reforms in child care and later became a government commission on women&#x27;s work and chair of the Federation of Business and Professional Women.

==Personal life==

In 1924, she married Professor Gunnar Myrdal. Together they had children Jan Myrdal (born 1927), Sissela Bok (born 1934) and Kaj Fölster (born 1936).

Her grandchildren include Hilary Bok and Stefan Fölster.

<text>Waylon J. Smithers Jr., usually referred to as Mr. Smithers, or simply Smithers, is a recurring character in the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, voiced by Harry Shearer. His first appearance was in the episode of &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, although his voice could be heard in the series premiere &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;. He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant&#x27;s owner Mr. Burns, and is usually treated unfairly.

Smithers&#x27;s loyalty and devotion to Mr. Burns was inspired from how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. Smithers&#x27;s first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers. The idea for Smithers&#x27;s ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon. He proposed that Smithers should be gay and have an undying love for Mr. Burns. Smithers was colorized in his first appearance as black with blue hair. Matt Groening, in an interview with TMZ, said that this was a mistake but the producers did not have enough money to correct it.

Smithers is the loyal, obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns, and the relationship between the two is a frequent running gag. In many ways, Smithers represents the stereotype of a closeted gay man. Numerous allusions and double entendres about his homosexuality are made, though some of the show&#x27;s producers instead interpret him as a &quot;Burns-sexual&quot;. In the season 27 (2016) episode &quot;The Burns Cage&quot;, he officially came out as gay.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Mr. Smithers is Mr. Burns&#x27;s devoted executive assistant. His father, Waylon Smithers Sr., worked for Burns until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown when Smithers was a baby. Smithers began thinking of Mr. Burns as his commander shortly after his birth. Up until 2016, he was not openly gay, but most people knew he was homosexual before he came out. It was revealed in a flashback that he was married to a woman once, but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them. Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns, and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as &quot;Burns-sexual&quot;. &quot;He deserves his time,&quot; says the writer of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; about Smithers&#x27;s gay love story in 2021.

Mr. Burns remained largely ignorant of Smithers&#x27;s devoted adoration, much to Smithers&#x27;s frustration. Mr. Burns himself has been involved with several women and, in &quot;A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love&quot;, Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion. Burns, for his part, views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey, albeit a highly valued one for his competence. He has &quot;rewarded&quot; Smithers&#x27;s devotion with the future &quot;honor&quot; of being buried alive with him after he dies. Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns. In &quot;Homer the Smithers&quot;, Mr. Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns&#x27;s assistant and eventually gets his job back. In the season 27 episode &quot;The Burns Cage&quot;, Smithers attempts to admit his love to Burns, who interrupts to reaffirm his contempt for his assistant.

Smithers&#x27;s official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant, which he says is &quot;actually about 2,800 smaller jobs&quot;, responsible for monitoring employee attendance, and is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of employee-of-the-month awards. Smithers does appear to be one of the few people at the power plant who is seemingly competent at their job as opposed to the lazy, oafish underlings such as Homer Simpson and the senile Mr. Burns, who is often out of touch with the modern times. While some of his early appearances showed him to have a malicious side (he tried to get Homer fired over his insurance claim for a hair-growing product, and the only reason this failed is that Mr. Burns had sympathy for Homer due to his own incurable baldness and gave him his old job back), his overall characterization is fairly benevolent and he ultimately just wants the SNPP to run well. He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive vice president, but Burns has repeatedly squashed this dream, while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on a dog. Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in the world, and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club. In &quot;Werking Mom&quot;, Smithers makes a silent cameo as a drag queen named &#x27;The Mysterious Waylon&#x27;.

==Character==

Mr. Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers&#x27;s orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads. Jay Kogen said &quot;Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay.&quot; The script for &quot;Blood Feud&quot; originally featured Smithers saying &quot;Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids&quot;, but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon, coined by Mike Reiss, was first used in &quot;I Married Marge&quot; and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.

Smithers made his first appearance in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, which was the third episode of the first season, although he can be heard over a speaker in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; series premiere &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;. In his first visual appearance in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made darker than most characters by Gyorgyi Peluce, the color stylist. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be &quot;Mr Burns&#x27; white sycophant&quot;, and the staff thought it &quot;would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character&quot; and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. Silverman retconned this error by saying that Smithers had a tan from a recent holiday in the Caribbean. The first appearance of a yellow Smithers was &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;, the fourth episode of the first season.

==Development==
Mr. Smithers&#x27;s relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers&#x27;s true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. Smithers&#x27;s sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a &quot;Burns-sexual&quot; and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is gay. During the Bill Oakley/Josh Weinstein era, they still tried to keep his sexuality unspoken and there was debate among the writers about his orientation. Al Jean, who thinks of Smithers as being a &quot;Burns-sexual&quot;, felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay. David Silverman, a former supervising director has said, &quot;[Smithers] seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to anything beyond that. [Rather than being gay], he&#x27;s sort of &#x27;Burns-sexual&#x27;.&quot; In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian, but Smithers was not included. A list published in 2008 by the same organization included Smithers; Patty Bouvier, Marge Simpson&#x27;s lesbian sister, was included on both lists.
The debate is referenced in &quot;The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular&quot;, when the episode host, Troy McClure is answering viewer questions, and one that is asked is &quot;What is the real deal with Mr. Burns&#x27;s assistant Smithers? You know what I&#x27;m talking about.&quot; A montage of various clips that shows Smithers&#x27;s lust for Mr. Burns follows, and in the end, McClure says &quot;as you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he&#x27;s Mr. Burns&#x27;s assistant. He&#x27;s in his early forties, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing!&quot;

Several of the allusions to Smithers&#x27;s sexuality have turned into battles with the network censors. For example, in Smithers&#x27;s fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in &quot;Rosebud&quot;, the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is &quot;Marge Gets a Job&quot;, which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally it went on for a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed &quot;Mr. Burns land[ing] in a particular position on Smithers&#x27;s anatomy&quot;. There were also issues with &quot;the lump in his bed&quot;, which the animators said had been drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted.

In the second season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns&#x27; relationship, and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition.

Mostly in the early seasons, Smithers had a catchphrase, which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is. Smithers and Burns would watch Homer (usually over a security camera feed) and Burns would ask, &quot;Who is that man?&quot;, to which Smithers would reply, &quot;That&#x27;s Homer Simpson, sir, one of your [drones, organ banks, carbon blobs, etc.] from sector 7G.&quot; Burns would invariably respond, &quot;Simpson, eh?&quot;

In September 2015, it was confirmed by Jean that Smithers would come out to Mr. Burns in a season 27 episode. Though in the end he never came out to Mr. Burns as his attempt was cut short. The episode, &quot;The Burns Cage&quot;, was broadcast the following April and saw Smithers unsuccessfully try to move on from Burns. A writer for British progressive magazine the &quot;New Statesman&quot; felt that the episode was a retcon, making a serious story about the character&#x27;s homosexuality instead of the previous jokes and innuendo that were now considered homophobic.

==Reception==

In 2004, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; producers announced that one of their characters was going to come out of the closet. Speculation on who it would be was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada (even claiming Smithers&#x27;s &quot;sexual orientation was about the worst-kept secret in Springfield&quot;) as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, (the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; called Smithers &quot;too obvious&quot; a choice), and the United Kingdom. Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; calculated the odds of several characters being gay, with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on &quot;cartoon gaydar&quot; who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers. Jenny Stewart, the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll, &quot;We&#x27;ve never had such an avalanche of people voting in any of our polls as we did on The Simpsons.&quot; It was Patty Bouvier who came out.

In a 2007 article, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Smithers the 16th-greatest sidekick of all time. They have also described Smithers and Mr. Burns as being &quot;TV&#x27;s most functional dysfunctional couple&quot;. &quot;Star News Online&quot; named &quot;Smithers&#x27; fey way&quot; as one of the 400 reasons why they loved &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In a 2003 article, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named the two-part episode &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, in which Smithers was prominently featured, the series&#x27; 25th-best episode. Gay.com ranked Smithers as the sixth-gayest cartoon character.

==Merchandise==
Smithers was made into an action figure, and four different versions were included as part of the &quot;World of Springfield&quot; toy line. The first shows Smithers in his normal attire with a picture of Mr. Burns at his feet and was released in 2000 as part of &quot;wave two&quot;. The second, released in 2002 as part of &quot;wave ten&quot;, is called &quot;resort Smithers&quot; and shows him dressed as he was at the resort in the episode &quot;Homer the Smithers&quot;. In 2003, a series of figures exclusive to &quot;Electronics Boutique&quot; was released, and a set of one Mr. Burns figure and two different Smithers toys based on the episode &quot;Rosebud&quot; were included. One, called &quot;Bobo Smithers&quot; shows Smithers dressed as Mr. Burns&#x27;s teddy bear Bobo; and the other, known as &quot;future Smithers&quot;, shows him as a robotic dog. A &quot;future Burns&quot; was included in the set as a companion to &quot;future Smithers&quot; and depicts Burns as a robot as he appeared at the end of the episode.

<text>The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the American League (AL), is the younger of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the &quot;Senior Circuit&quot;).

Since 1903, the American League champion has played in the World Series against the National League champion with only two exceptions: 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants refused to play their AL counterpart, and 1994, when a players&#x27; strike resulted in the cancellation of the Series. Through 2024, American League teams have won 68 of the 120 World Series played since 1903. The New York Yankees have won 27 World Series and 41 American League titles, the most in major league history. The Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics have won the second most AL titles with 15, followed by the Boston Red Sox with 14.

For decades, Major League baseball clubs only played teams from their own league during the regular season and playoffs, with only the two pennant winners meeting in the World Series. The AL and NL also employed and trained their own umpires, who only worked regular season games in their own league. These differences resulted in the leagues developing slightly different strategies and styles of play. The American League was usually regarded as the less &quot;traditional&quot; league during the 20th century, a reputation most exemplified by the introduction of the designated hitter rule in 1973, which encouraged AL managers to largely abandon &quot;smallball&quot; tactics. However, with the advent of free agency in the 1970s allowing for more player movement between leagues, the introduction of regular season interleague play in 1997, umpires working games across MLB beginning in 1999, and the NL&#x27;s adoption of the designated hitter rule in 2022, the difference in play between the two major leagues has diminished considerably.

Though both leagues agreed to be jointly governed by a commissioner in 1920, they remained separate business entities with their own presidents and management. This was the case until after the 1999 season, when the American League legally merged with the National League under the auspices of Major League Baseball, which now operates much like other North American professional sports leagues, albeit with two &quot;leagues&quot; instead of &quot;conferences&quot;.

==History==
Originally a minor league known as the Western League, which existed from 1885 to 1899 with teams in mostly Great Lakes states, the league changed its name to the American League for the 1900 season and the next year developed into a second major league as a competitor to the older National League. This was prompted by the NL dropping four teams following the 1899 season after having absorbed its previous rival, the American Association, which disbanded in 1891 after ten seasons.

In its early history of the late 1880s, the minor Western League struggled until 1894, when Ban Johnson became the president of the league. Johnson pushed the league to rise to major league status, after the name change to the American League was decided in a league meeting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the former Republican Hotel. A historical marker is at the intersection of North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and West Kilbourn Avenue where the hotel once stood.

In March 1904, Johnson moved the league&#x27;s headquarters from Chicago to New York.

Babe Ruth, noted as one of the most prolific hitters in Major League Baseball history, spent the majority of his career in the American League with the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. From 1973 to 2022 The American League had one notable difference versus the rival National League, as it had the designated hitter rule. Under the rule, a team may use a batter in its lineup who is not in the field defensively, replacing the pitcher in the batting order, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher to bat. In the last two decades, the season schedule has allowed occasional interleague play. In 1969, the AL (and NL) were divided into East and West divisions, with a postseason playoff series for the pennant and the right to play in the World Series.

Until the late 1970s, league umpires working behind home plate wore large, balloon-style chest protectors worn outside the shirt or coat, while their colleagues in the National League wore chest protectors inside the shirt or coat. In 1977, new umpires (including Steve Palermo) had to wear the inside chest protector, although those on staff wearing the outside protector could continue to do so. Most umpires made the switch to the inside protector, led by Don Denkinger in 1975 and Jim Evans the next year, although several did not, including Bill Haller, Russ Goetz, George Maloney, Bill Kunkel and Jerry Neudecker, who became the last full-time MLB umpire to use the outside protector in 1985.

In 1994, the league, along with the National League, reorganized again, this time into three divisions (East, West, and Central) and added a third round to the playoffs in the form of the American League Division Series, with the best second-place team advancing to the playoffs as a wild-card team, in addition to the three divisional champions. In 1998, the newly franchised Tampa Bay Devil Rays joined the league, and the Arizona Diamondbacks joined the National League: i.e., each league added a fifteenth team. An odd number of teams per league meant that at least one team in each league would have to be idle on any given day, or alternatively, that odd team out would have had to play an interleague game against its counterpart in the other league. The initial plan was to have three five-team divisions per league with inter-league play year-round—possibly as many as 30 interleague games per team each year.

For various reasons, it soon seemed more practical to have an even number of teams in both leagues. The Milwaukee Brewers agreed to change leagues to become the National League&#x27;s 16th team, moving from the AL Central to the NL Central. At the same time, the Detroit Tigers were moved from the AL East to the AL Central, making room for the Devil Rays in the East. Even after expansion, the American League then continued with 14 teams. This situation changed again in 2013 when the Houston Astros moved from the National League Central division to the American League West. The Astros had been in the NL for 51 years since beginning as an expansion team in 1962. Since their move, both leagues now consist of 15 teams.

===Interleague play, and merger===
For the first 96 years, American League teams faced their National League counterparts only in exhibition games or in the World Series. Beginning in 1997, interleague games have been played during the regular season and count in the standings. As part of the agreement instituting interleague play, the designated-hitter rule was used only in games where the American League team is the home team, until the 2022 season, when the universal DH rule was implemented. 
In 2023, American League teams played 46 regular season interleague games against all 15 National League teams, 23 at home and 23 on the road.

In 2000, the American League ended its status as a legally independent entity when the American and National Leagues were both merged into the legal entity Major League Baseball (MLB). This left MLB as a single league, divided into two parts, also called leagues. This change in legal status had no effect on play, scheduling, and so forth.

==Teams==

===Charter franchises===
There were eight charter teams in 1901, the league&#x27;s first year as a major league, and
the next year the original Milwaukee Brewers (not to be confused with the current Milwaukee Brewers) moved to St. Louis to become the St. Louis Browns, and the year after the New York Highlanders replaced the disbanded original Baltimore Orioles. Those eight franchises constituted the league for 52 seasons until the Browns moved to Baltimore and took up the Orioles name. The eight original teams and their counterparts in the &quot;Classic Eight&quot; were:

*Original Baltimore Orioles (not to be confused with the current Baltimore Orioles, see Milwaukee Brewers) folded after the 1902 season, and was replaced by the New York team that began play in 1903. The New York franchise was nicknamed &quot;Highlanders&quot;, &quot;Americans&quot;, and &quot;Yankees&quot; until the latter became official in 1913.
*Boston Americans (became the Boston Red Sox in 1908)
*Chicago White Stockings (name shortened to White Sox in 1904)
*Cleveland Blues (became the Cleveland Indians in 1915 and the Cleveland Guardians in 2022)
*Detroit Tigers (name and locale unchanged from 1894 forward)
*Original Milwaukee Brewers (became the St. Louis Browns in 1902 and the current Baltimore Orioles in 1954)
*Philadelphia Athletics (became the Kansas City Athletics in 1955, the Oakland Athletics in 1968, and the Athletics in 2025)
*Original Washington Senators (became the Minnesota Twins in 1961)

==Timeline==
The first line is the transformation of the American League (AL) to a major league in 1901. The second line is the beginning of the expansion era in 1961. The third line marks the legal merger of the American and National Leagues into a single Major League Baseball in 2000.

World Series championships are shown with a &quot;•&quot;, American League Pennants before the World Series are shown with a &quot;#&quot;, and American League Pennants who lost the World Series are shown with a &quot;^&quot;. No World Series was played in 1904, so the pennant winners for each league are indicated. Due to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, there were no pennant or World Series winners in 1994, so this year is left blank.

==Presidents==

Following the 1999 season, the American and National Leagues were merged with Major League Baseball, and the leagues ceased to exist as business entities. The position of the American League President and National League President became honorary.

<doc id="64778" wikidata="Q108301" url="?curid=64778" title="Maurice Utrillo">
<text>Maurice Utrillo (; born Maurice Valadon; 26 December 1883 – 5 November 1955) was a French painter of the School of Paris who specialized in cityscapes. From the Montmartre quarter of Paris, France, Utrillo is one of the few famous painters of Montmartre to have been born there.

==Biography==

Utrillo was the son of the artist Suzanne Valadon (born Marie-Clémentine Valadon), who was then an eighteen-year-old artist&#x27;s model. She never revealed the father of her child; speculation exists that he was the offspring of a liaison with an equally young amateur painter named Boissy, or with the well-established painter Pierre-Cécile Puvis de Chavannes, or even with Renoir. (See below under &quot;Paternity&quot;). In 1891 a Spanish artist, Miquel Utrillo, signed a legal document acknowledging paternity, although the question remains as to whether he was in fact the child&#x27;s father.

Valadon, who became a model after a fall from a trapeze ended her chosen career as a circus acrobat, found that posing for Berthe Morisot, Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others provided her with an opportunity to study their techniques. She taught herself to paint, and when Toulouse-Lautrec introduced her to Edgar Degas, he became her mentor. Eventually, she became a peer of the artists she had posed for.

Meanwhile, her mother was left to raise the young Maurice, who soon showed a troubling inclination toward truancy and alcoholism. When schizophrenia took hold of the 21-year-old Utrillo in 1904, his mother encouraged him to take up painting. He soon showed real artistic talent. With no training beyond what his mother taught him, he drew and painted what he saw in Montmartre. After 1910 his work attracted critical attention, and by 1920 he was internationally acclaimed. In 1928, the French government awarded him the Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. Throughout his life, however, he was interned in mental asylums repeatedly.

Today, tourists to the area will find many of his paintings on postcards, one of which is his very popular 1936 painting entitled &quot;Montmartre Street Corner&quot; or &quot;Lapin Agile&quot;.

In middle age Utrillo became fervently religious and in 1935, at the age of fifty-two, he married Lucie Valore and moved to Le Vésinet, just outside Paris. By that time, he was too ill to work in the open air and painted landscapes viewed from windows, from postcards, and from memory.

Although his life also was plagued by alcoholism, he lived into his seventies. Maurice Utrillo died on 5 November 1955 in Hotel Splendid in Dax, at age 72, of a lung disease, and was buried in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in Montmartre.

==Paternity==
An apocryphal anecdote told by Diego Rivera concerning Utrillo&#x27;s paternity is related in the unpublished memoirs of one of his American collectors, Ruth Bakwin:

&quot;After Maurice was born to Suzanne Valadon, she went to Renoir, for whom she had modeled nine months previously. Renoir looked at the baby and said, &#x27;He can&#x27;t be mine, the color is terrible!&#x27; Next she went to Degas, for whom she had also modeled. He said, &#x27;He can&#x27;t be mine, the form is terrible!&#x27; At a cafe, Valadon saw an artist she knew named Miguel Utrillo, to whom she spilled her woes. The man told her to call the baby Utrillo: &#x27;I would be glad to put my name to the work of either Renoir or Degas!&#x27;&quot;

==2010 exhibitions and sale==
In 2010, several retrospective exhibitions were staged, at Oglethorpe University Museum of Art and in Montmartre (Paris) that culminated in an auction of 30 of Utrillo&#x27;s works on 30 November 2010 from the collection of , Utrillo&#x27;s art dealer, whose also dealt with the likes of Jacques Thévenet. This follows the exhibition of Suzanne Valadon and Maurice Utrillo&#x27;s works held in Paris in 2009.

== Nazi-looted art ==
In 2022, Utrillo&#x27;s &quot;Carrefour à Sannois&quot; which the Nazis had looted from the French Jewish art collector and dealer Georges Bernheim in 1940, was restituted to the heirs after a long legal battle. The city of Sannois (Val-d&#x27;Oise) had bought the painting at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2004. In 2015 the Commission responsible for dealing with Nazi-looted art (the CIVS) advised the town that the painting had been looted. A new law voted by France&#x27;s National Assembly in 2022 paved the way for restitution. 

==In popular culture==
Utrillo is played by Bruno Gouery in the 2024 film &quot;Modì, Three Days on the Wing of Madness&quot; directed and co-produced by Johnny Depp.

<doc id="64803" wikidata="Q1723523" url="?curid=64803" title="Canadian literature">
<text>Canadian literature is written in several languages including English, French, and to some degree various Indigenous languages. It is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration. 

==Indigenous literature==

Indigenous peoples of Canada are culturally diverse. Each group has its own literature, language and culture. The term &quot;Indigenous literature&quot; therefore can be misleading, as writer Jeannette Armstrong states in one interview, &quot;I would stay away from the idea of &quot;Native&quot; literature, there is no such thing. There is Mohawk literature, there is Okanagan literature, but there is no generic Native in Canada&quot;.

==French-Canadian literature==
In 1802, the Lower Canada legislative library was founded. All books it contained were subsequently moved to the Canadian parliament in Montreal when the two Canadas, Lower and Upper, were united. On April 25, 1849 the Canadian parliament was burned along with thousands of French Canadian books and a few hundred English books. A consequence of this event was the mistaken impression that from the early settlements until the 1820s, Quebec had virtually no literature. 

It was the rise of Quebec patriotism and the 1837 Lower Canada Rebellion, in addition to a modern system of primary school education, which led to the rise of French-Canadian fiction. &quot;L&#x27;influence d&#x27;un livre&quot; by Philippe-Ignace-Francois Aubert de Gaspé is widely regarded as the first French-Canadian novel. The genres which first became popular were the rural novel and the historical novel. French authors were influential, especially authors like Balzac.

In 1866, Father Henri-Raymond Casgrain became one of Quebec&#x27;s first literary theorists. He argued that literature&#x27;s goal should be to project an image of proper Catholic morality. However, a few authors like Louis-Honoré Fréchette and Arthur Buies broke the conventions to write more interesting works.

This pattern continued until the 1930s with a new group of authors educated at the Université Laval and the Université de Montréal. Novels with psychological and sociological foundations became the norm. Gabrielle Roy and Anne Hébert even began to earn international acclaim, which had not happened to French-Canadian literature before. During this period, Quebec theatre, which had previously been melodramas and comedies, became far more involved.

French-Canadian literature began to greatly expand with the turmoil of the Second World War, the beginnings of industrialization in the 1950s, and most especially the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s. French-Canadian literature also began to attract a great deal of attention globally, with Acadian novelist Antonine Maillet winning the Prix Goncourt in 1979. An experimental branch of Québécois literature also developed; for instance the poet Nicole Brossard wrote in a formalist style.
In 1979, Roch Carrier wrote the story &quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot;, which highlighted the cultural and social tensions between English and French speaking Canada.

==Before Confederation==

Because Canada only officially became a country following the unification, or &#x27;confederation&#x27; of several colonies, including Upper and Lower Canada, into one nation on July 1, 1867, it has been argued that literature written before this time was colonial. The book often considered to be the first work of Canadian literature is &quot;The History of Emily Montague&quot; by Frances Brooke, published in 1769. Brooke wrote the novel in Sillery, Quebec following the Conquest of New France. Susanna Moodie and Catharine Parr Traill, English sisters who adopted the country as their own, moved to Upper Canada in 1832. They recorded their experiences as pioneers in Parr Traill&#x27;s &quot;The Backwoods of Canada&quot; (1836) and &quot;Canadian Crusoes&quot; (1852), and Moodie&#x27;s &quot;Roughing It in the Bush&quot; (1852) and &quot;Life in the Clearings&quot; (1853). However, both women wrote until their deaths, placing them in the country for more than 50 years and certainly well past Confederation. Moreover, their books often dealt with survival and the rugged Canadian environment; these themes re-appear in other Canadian works, including Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Survival&quot;. Moodie and Parr Trail&#x27;s sister, Agnes Strickland, remained in England and wrote elegant royal biographies, creating a stark contrast between Canadian and English literatures.

However, one of the earliest Canadian writers virtually always included in Canadian literary anthologies is Thomas Chandler Haliburton (1796–1865), born and raised in Nova Scotia, who died just two years before Canada&#x27;s official birth. He is remembered for his comic character, Sam Slick, who appeared in &quot;The Clockmaker&quot; and other humorous works throughout Haliburton&#x27;s life.

==After 1867==

A group of poets now known as the &quot;Confederation Poets&quot;, including Charles G. D. Roberts, Archibald Lampman, Bliss Carman, Duncan Campbell Scott, and William Wilfred Campbell, came to prominence in the 1880s and 1890s. Choosing the world of nature as their inspiration, their work was drawn from their own experiences and, at its best, written in their own tones. Isabella Valancy Crawford, Annie Campbell Huestis, Frederick George Scott, and Francis Sherman are also sometimes associated with this group.

During this period, E. Pauline Johnson and William Henry Drummond were writing popular poetry – Johnson&#x27;s based on her part-Mohawk heritage, and Drummond, the Poet of the Habitant, writing dialect verse.

L. M. Montgomery&#x27;s novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was first published in 1908. It has sold an estimated 50 million copies and is one of the best selling books worldwide.

Between 1915 and 1925, Stephen Leacock (1869–1944) was the best selling humour writer in the world. His best known book of fiction, Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town was published in 1912. 

Three of Canada&#x27;s most important post-World War I novelists were Hugh MacLennan (1907–1990), W.O. Mitchell (1914–1998), and Morley Callaghan (1903–1990). MacLennan&#x27;s best-known works are &quot;Barometer Rising&quot; (1941), &quot;The Watch That Ends the Night&quot; (1957), and &quot;Two Solitudes&quot; (1945), while Callaghan is best known for &quot;Such Is My Beloved&quot; (1934), &quot;The Loved and the Lost&quot; (1951), and &quot;More Joy in Heaven&quot; (1937). Mitchell&#x27;s most-loved novel is Who Has Seen the Wind. 
Perhaps reacting against a tradition that largely emphasized the wilderness and the small town and country experience, Leonard Cohen wrote the novel &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; (1966). It was labelled by one reviewer &quot;the most revolting book ever written in Canada&quot;. In time, however, this novel was considered a Canadian classic. Despite beginning his career as a poet of major importance, Cohen is perhaps best known as a folk singer and songwriter, with an international following.

Canadian author Farley Mowat is best known for his work &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; (1963) and his Governor General&#x27;s Award-winning children&#x27;s book, &quot;Lost in the Barrens&quot; (1956).

Following World War II, writers such as Mavis Gallant, Mordecai Richler, Norman Levine, Sheila Watson, Margaret Laurence and Irving Layton added to the Modernist influence in Canadian literature previously introduced by F. R. Scott, A. J. M. Smith and others associated with the &quot;McGill Fortnightly&quot;. This influence, at first, was not broadly appreciated. Norman Levine&#x27;s &quot;Canada Made Me&quot;, a travelogue that presented a sour interpretation of the country in 1958, for example, was widely rejected.

After 1967, the country&#x27;s centennial year, the national government increased funding to publishers and numerous small presses began operating throughout the country.
The best-known Canadian children&#x27;s writers include L. M. Montgomery and Monica Hughes.

==Contemporary Canadian literature: After 1967==
Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Other great 20th-century Canadian authors include Margaret Laurence, Mavis Gallant, Michael Ondaatje, Carol Shields, Alistair MacLeod, Mazo de la Roche, and Gabrielle Roy.

This group, along with Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English, were part of a &#x27;new wave&#x27; of Canadian writers, some starting their careers in the 1950s. The first to elevate Canadian Literature to the world stage were Lucy Maud Montgomery, Stephen Leacock, Mazo de la Roche, and Morley Callaghan. During the post-war decades Canadian literature, as were Australian and New Zealand literature, viewed as an appendage to British Literature. When academic Clara Thomas decided in the 1940s to concentrate on Canadian literature for her master&#x27;s thesis, the idea was so novel and so radical that word of her decision reached &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; books editor William Arthur Deacon, who then personally reached out to Thomas to pledge his and the newspaper&#x27;s resources in support of her work.

Other major Canadian novelists include Carol Shields, Lawrence Hill, and Alice Munro. Carol Shields novel &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and another novel, &quot;Larry&#x27;s Party&quot;, won the Orange Prize in 1998. Lawrence Hill&#x27;s &quot;Book of Negroes&quot; won the 2008 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize Overall Best Book Award, while Alice Munro became the first Canadian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013. Munro also received the Man Booker International Prize in 2009.

In the 1960s, a renewed sense of nation helped foster new voices in Canadian poetry, including: Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Leonard Cohen, Eli Mandel and Margaret Avison. Others such as Al Purdy, Milton Acorn, and Earle Birney, already published, produced some of their best work during this period.

The TISH Poetry movement in Vancouver brought about poetic innovation from Jamie Reid, George Bowering, Fred Wah, Frank Davey, Daphne Marlatt, David Cull, and Lionel Kearns.
 Canadian poets have been expanding the boundaries of originality: Christian Bök, Ken Babstock, Karen Solie, Lynn Crosbie, Patrick Lane, George Elliott Clarke and Barry Dempster have all imprinted their unique consciousnesses onto the map of Canadian imagery. 
A notable anthology of Canadian poetry is &quot;The New Oxford book of Canadian Verse&quot;, edited by Margaret Atwood ().

Anne Carson is probably the best known Canadian poet living today. Carson in 1996 won the Lannan Literary Award for poetry. The foundation&#x27;s awards in 2006 for poetry, fiction and nonfiction each came with $US 150,000.

<text>Edna Krabappel-Flanders ( ) is a fictional character from the American animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, voiced by Marcia Wallace. A 4th-grade teacher, she teaches Bart Simpson&#x27;s class at Springfield Elementary School. In the twenty-third season, she marries Ned Flanders.

Following Marcia Wallace&#x27;s death in 2013, the show&#x27;s producers announced that her character would be retired. The epilogue of the season 25 episode &quot;The Man Who Grew Too Much&quot; marks Edna Krabappel&#x27;s final original speaking role.

==Profile==
Edna Krabappel holds a Master&#x27;s from Bryn Mawr College. She is a surly, grumpy and jaded caricature of the American public school system. In &quot;The Seemingly Never-Ending Story&quot;, it is revealed that she was once a very optimistic woman who genuinely wanted to help people in need. It would seem that after years of frustration thanks to the school, and Bart Simpson in particular, this wore away.

There is some inconsistency about Edna&#x27;s origins. She is said to have come to Springfield to begin teaching in &quot;The Seemingly Never-Ending Story&quot;. However, in a case of retconning, she can be seen in &quot;Springfield Up&quot; as a student running through the background at Springfield High School while a young Chief Wiggum is filmed carrying out his duties as a hall monitor as part of the documentary featured in that episode.

Edna smokes heavily, including during school hours. In the episode &quot;Grade School Confidential&quot;, she and Principal Skinner have a romance after they are invited to Martin Prince&#x27;s birthday party. They are witnessed kissing in Martin&#x27;s playhouse by Bart. Principal Skinner then sends Bart to relay a message to Edna in front of his classmates who laugh at him, making him furious. He then shows them what they are doing and tells them not to tell anyone about their relationship, especially Superintendent Chalmers. Unknown to Bart they lose their jobs when Superintendent Chalmers finds out about their affair via Chief Wiggum and they lock themselves in the school with Bart until they are reinstated. They apologize to Bart for embarrassing him. After returning to their jobs, they resume their romance in a janitorial closet. In &quot;Bart Gets a &#x27;Z&#x27;, she is fired from teaching when she becomes drunk after drinking coffee that was spiked with alcohol by Bart. She later decides to open a muffin store. She is later rehired when the substitute teacher gets drunk. In &quot;Moms I&#x27;d Like to Forget&quot;, she fights a fifth grade teacher, Mike, who talks badly about her students; this leads to a massive teacher brawl. In &quot;The Ned-Liest Catch&quot;, she is suspended from teaching for slapping Bart and is placed in the Teacher Holding Facility. When Bart attempts to free her, she falls off a ladder but is saved by Ned Flanders.

==Love life==
A recurring theme is Edna&#x27;s desire for a romantic partner. She is divorced; in &quot;Separate Vocations&quot;, she implies that her husband left her for their marriage counselor with whom he had an affair. In early episodes, she is shown as very sexually aggressive and promiscuous: in &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot;, she is shown with her arms around two sailors in the parody of the famous &quot;Cheers&quot; theme, and tries to pick up Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer and Homer Simpson, even after learning he is married and is Bart&#x27;s father. In &quot;Bart&#x27;s Friend Falls in Love&quot;, while the children are watching an unseen explicit scene in &quot;Fuzzy Bunny&#x27;s Guide to You-Know-What&quot;, a sex ed film, she says to the children in disgust, &quot;She&#x27;s faking it&quot;. In the same episode, Nelson Muntz asks why she does not live with &quot;Mr. Krabappel&quot;; she tells him that her ex-husband &quot;chased something small and fluffy down the rabbit hole&quot;. In &quot;One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish&quot;, she has a &quot;hot encounter&quot; with a local Japanese sushi chef in the backseat of her car.

The episode &quot;Bart the Lover&quot; was the first episode to give Edna a central role, and also to expand her character and personality. In the episode, she has a personal ad placed in the newspaper so she can find a man. The advertisement is answered by Bart – under the alias of &quot;Woodrow&quot;, a seemingly perfect male lover named after former President Woodrow Wilson – as a prank. This results in a cycle of romantic letters between both Edna and &quot;Woodrow&quot;. Intending to finish the prank, Bart invites Edna to the Gilded Truffle Restaurant so she can meet with Woodrow. Edna waits expectantly for Woodrow, but is heartbroken after he does not appear. With his family&#x27;s help, Bart writes a goodbye letter to Edna as Woodrow, satisfying her.

Edna appears to be desired by many men (and in one case even women, when Patty Bouvier once had a sexual fantasy with Edna), as seen in Sideshow Bob&#x27;s outrage (in &quot;Brother from Another Series&quot;) wherein his romantic date with her is ruined by a spying Bart: &quot;You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel!&quot;

Another theme is her relationship with the school principal, Seymour Skinner. In the episode &quot;Grade School Confidential&quot;, she develops a secret romance with Skinner, a relationship that almost leads to marriage. In the episode &quot;Special Edna&quot;, Skinner proposes to Edna, to which she agrees. However, in the episode &quot;My Big Fat Geek Wedding&quot;, Edna leaves Skinner at the altar after realizing that he doesn&#x27;t want to marry her. Since then, Edna&#x27;s attitudes to Skinner have vacillated between passion and disdain in various episodes. In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, she can be seen at the Green Day concert on top of Seymour&#x27;s shoulders wearing a T-shirt saying &quot;Not my boyfriend&quot; with an arrow pointing down at Skinner.

In season 17 (&quot;The Seemingly Never-Ending Story&quot;), a flashback showed that Edna was in a serious relationship with Moe Szyslak when she first moved to Springfield, before meeting Skinner or even becoming a teacher. She was about to elope with him, but then changed her mind when she met Bart Simpson, a student she believed needed help. Consequently, Moe breaks up with her. At the end of the episode, Moe and Edna are a couple once again, much to Skinner&#x27;s jealousy when he catches them making out on school property. In &quot;Regarding Margie&quot;, she and Principal Skinner are seen making love on a golf course. Then he climbs off and she says, &quot;Birthday is over, Seymour&quot;, and lights up a cigarette.

Edna is in a relationship with Ned Flanders. During the 22nd episode of the 22nd season, &quot;The Ned-Liest Catch&quot;, Ned and Edna began dating (Though the two have dated previously in the episode &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot;). The fate of the couple was left to a fan vote, to be revealed during the 23rd season opener. When &quot;The Falcon and the D&#x27;ohman&quot; debuted, it revealed that the fans voted in favor of the relationship. At the close of the episode, a disclaimer appeared on screen which stated – &quot;What our fans have joined together, let no writer rip asunder&quot;. It is also revealed in &quot;The Ned-Liest Catch&quot; that she has &quot;dated&quot; in addition to Skinner, Moe Szyslak, Lenny, Carl, Comic Book Guy, Joey Kramer, Krusty the Clown, Cletus Spuckler, and several others.

It is revealed in the episode &quot;Ned &#x27;n&#x27; Edna&#x27;s Blend Agenda&quot; that Edna and Ned married in secret (although she continues to use her first married name, Krabappel, as a teacher), and the town throws them a proper reception. In the episode &quot;Left Behind&quot;, Ned took a teaching job as a way to honor Edna&#x27;s memory after she dies. In the 30th-season episode, &quot;My Way or the Highway to Heaven&quot;, Edna is seen in heaven next to George Washington while Maude Flanders is seen next to Abraham Lincoln.

==Character==

Krabappel&#x27;s name was chosen by early &quot;Simpsons&quot; writers Wallace Wolodarsky and Jay Kogen as a play on the fruit &quot;crabapple&quot; and as a reference to the teacher Miss Crabtree from the 1930s &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts. Also, there was an initial joke of no one mispronouncing the character&#x27;s last name as &quot;Crabapple&quot; until Milhouse uses it in a later episode, stunning the other children. The real Seymour Skinner also mispronounced her name. In one episode, Homer is horrified to learn that no one has corrected him for accidentally calling her &quot;Crandall&quot;. Like many characters, Ms. Krabappel has a memorable catchphrase, used often in the series: her derisive laugh (&quot;HA!&quot;).

===Retirement===
Marcia Wallace died on October 25, 2013; according to her son, the cause of death was related to pneumonia. Staff on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; had reportedly been aware of her illness. Showrunner Al Jean said, &quot;I was tremendously saddened to learn this morning of the passing of the brilliant and gracious Marcia Wallace.&quot; Although Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge Simpson, was considered to replace Wallace, Jean announced that the show would retire her character. The series first acknowledged Wallace&#x27;s passing in the episode &quot;Four Regrettings and a Funeral&quot;, in which the chalkboard gag in the opening sequence was changed to read a single &quot;We&#x27;ll really miss you Mrs. K&quot;. The episode &quot;The Man Who Grew Too Much&quot; later showed Ned Flanders wearing a black armband and mourning Edna, whose portrait joined that of Maude, Ned&#x27;s first wife.

===Posthumous character appearances===
In &quot;Moho House&quot; (season 28, episode 21), she appears as a ghost with Maude when Marge looks at everyone enjoying their spouses. She also appears as a ghost together with Maude in &quot;Monty Burns&#x27; Fleeing Circus&quot;, while Ned is watching his sons perform a song on stage. In &quot;Todd, Todd, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?&quot; (season 31, episode 9), she accompanies Maude Flanders as they greet Ned and Homer into Heaven, and appears again at the end of the episode as a ghost hovering over Ned&#x27;s bed, saying, &quot;Ha!&quot;. In &quot;Diary Queen&quot; (season 32, episode 12), the episode is centred around her diary and she guest-stars through archive recordings.

==Cultural impact and reception==
Marcia Wallace won an Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing Krabappel in the third-season episode &quot;Bart the Lover&quot;. IGN called &quot;Special Edna&quot; the best episode of the fourteenth season of the show. Tilda Swinton modeled her hairdo in the film &quot;Burn After Reading&quot; on Krabappel&#x27;s. &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked Krabappel as the 8th-best teacher.

<doc id="64814" wikidata="Q305958" url="?curid=64814" title="André-Louis Danjon">
<text>André-Louis Danjon (; 6 April 1890 – 21 April 1967) was a French astronomer who served as director of the Observatory of Strasbourg from 1930 to 1945 and of the Paris Observatory from 1945 to 1963. He developed several astronomical instruments to examine the regularity of the rotation of the earth and among his discoveries was an acceleration of the rotation of the Earth during periods of intense solar activity occurring in 11-year cycles correlated with an increase in earthquakes. The Danjon scale is used for measuring the intensity of lunar eclipses. He noted an increase in the number of dark lunar eclipses with solar activity which is termed as the Danjon effect.

== Life and work ==
Danjon was born in Caen to drapers Louis Dominique Danjon and Marie Justine Binet. He studied at the Lyce Malherbe and then went to the Ecole Normale Superieure during which time he worked at the observatory of the Societe Astronomique de France. He graduated in 1914 and was conscripted into the army during World War I. He served under Ernest Esclangon and lost an eye in combat in Champagne. He received war honours in 1915 and in 1919 he was appointed &quot;aide-astronome&quot; to the Strasbourg University. He took up duties as an observer at the Strasbourg Meridian observatory an began to work on the improvement of the observatory. He was involved in establishing a new observatory, the Observatoire de Haute-Provence which became operational in 1923.

Danjon devised a method to measure &quot;earthshine&quot; on the darkside of the Moon using a telescope in which a prism split the Moon&#x27;s image into two identical side-by-side images. By adjusting a diaphragm to dim one of the images until the sunlit portion had the same apparent brightness as the earthlit portion on the unadjusted image, he could quantify the diaphragm adjustment, and thus had a real measurement for the brightness of earthshine. He recorded the measurements using his method (now known as the Danjon scale, on which zero equates to a barely visible Moon) from 1925 until the 1950s. He extended similar methods to study the albedo of Venus and Mercury which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation &quot;Recherches de photometrie astronomique&quot; (1928) at Paris University. In 1930 he succeeded Ernest Esclangon as director of the Strasbourg Observatory. He was also appointed as a professor at Strasbourg University. In 1939, German invasion forced the move of faculty to Clermont-Ferrand near Vichy. He was arrested in November 1943 and he escaped being sent to Auschwitz and was released in January. After World War II, Esclangon retired from his position at the Paris Observatory and Danjon replaced him. Here he taught at the Sorbonne. In the 1960s he persuaded the government to establish the European Southern Observatories at La Silla and at Paranal. He also supported the establishment of radio astronomy.at Nancay in 1956.

Among his notable contributions to astronomy was the design of the impersonal (prismatic) astrolabe based on an earlier prismatic astrolabe developed by François Auguste Claude which is now known as the Danjon astrolabe, which led to an improvement in the accuracy of fundamental optical astrometry. An account of this instrument, and of the results of some early years of its operation, are given in Danjon&#x27;s 1958 George Darwin Lecture to the Royal Astronomical Society.

The &quot;Danjon limit&quot;, a proposed measure of the minimum angular separation between the Sun and the Moon at which a lunar crescent is visible is named after him. However, this limit may not exist. The Danjon effect is a name given for his observation that there is an increase in the number of &quot;dark&quot; total lunar eclipses during the 11 year solar sunspot maxima. He developed an astrolabe to identify irregularity in the rotational periodicity and concluded that there was increases in the Earth&#x27;s rotation during intense solar activity. He suggested that the atmospheric darkness might be due to an increase in aerosols in the atmosphere due to increased volcanic activity.

Danjon was the President of the Société astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, during two periods: 1947–49 and 1962–64. He was awarded the Prix Jules Janssen of the Société astronomique de France in 1950, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1958. In 1946 he was made Officier of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur and in 1954 he was made Commandeur.

Danjon died in 1967 in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine. He was married to Madeleine Renoult (m. 1919, died 1965) and they had four children.

<text>A 600 series connector is an obsolete three-pin connector with up to six conductors.

It was for many years the standard telephone service connector in Australia, used on rural party lines and the national Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department (later Telstra) landline network, but has since the 1970s been superseded by the six position modular connector in this application. a large installed base remained and a large variety of connectors, adapters and equipment such as ADSL filters were still in production and readily available.

It has no other common or standard use, either within Australia or beyond. However it is manufactured in other countries, usually in China, for export to Australia.

The 600 series plug has up to three flat pins plus a non-conducting spigot, which ensures correctly oriented insertion. Each pin carries up to two conductors by means of two contacts, one on each side of the pin. The pin bodies are of a non-conductive plastic material.

==Varieties==

The original series 600 plugs and sockets were designed to be equally suitable for fixed wall mounting or for use on flexible cords. Such connectors are still available, but specialised fixed and line versions also exist.

===605 plug===

Standard three pin six conductor. Often now replaced by a modular 6P2C connector and an adaptor; In particular, this combination is now the most common connector supplied with new equipment in Australia.

The non-conducting spigot of the original 605 plug was provided with a hole for a countersunk screw, allowing the plug to be fixed in a wall-mounted socket. Removal then required first removing the socket cover, to allow this retaining screw to be removed. In this way a semi-permanent connection, requiring tools for disconnection, could be achieved.

===610 socket===

Standard six conductor.

The original 610 socket was provided with two mounting holes, one behind the receptacle for the plug spigot, and both for countersunk screws. This arrangement allowed the socket to be secured using two screws, with no plug inserted, or alternatively with the plug inserted, using the same two mounting holes but with one of the screws passing through the spigot to secure the plug as well.

===611 socket===

Similar to 610, but with the contacts of pairs one and two allowed to connect when no plug is inserted, contact 1 connecting to 2 and 5 to 6.

This is particularly designed for mode 3 connection. The incoming line to the mode 3 device is connected using pair one, and pair two is used as the outgoing line to other devices. If the mode 3 device is unplugged, the switch contacts maintain line connection to the other devices.

This function is not generally supported by modular connectors. Modular connectors providing suitable switch contacts are available but not common; Instead, mode 3 devices use two modular connectors, one for the incoming line and the other for the outgoing line. The convenience of using a single connector in this application is one reason for the continued use of 600 series connectors, but mixing this wiring scheme with modular connectors does not work well. For example, if a modern modem with its supplied 6P2C adaptor is plugged into a conventionally wired 611 mode 3 socket, the result is to disconnect all downstream devices.

In some sockets conductors 3 and 4 also connect when no plug is present, shorting pair three. Sockets are also available with cams to allow the switching functions to be selectively enabled as required. In some older sockets this could be achieved by simply bending the contacts; The cams merely implement this useful accidental feature in an intentional fashion.

Many recent 611 sockets have a stepped recess for the plug spigot, to accept a plug with a larger spigot but still provide a good fit for a standard 605 plug. Equipment requiring mode 3 connection can then be equipped with these larger spigot plugs, to prevent this equipment being connected to a 610 socket which does not provide mode 3 support. These plugs are common on older fax machines and modems, and used on some security and similar equipment. These plugs were also used on Telex machines within Australia.

===Other varieties===

====60x plugs====

In general, 60x where x is any numeric other than 0 or 5 indicates a non-standard plug. Compatibility and designs vary from maker to maker.

====61x sockets====

In general, 61x where x is any numeric other than 0 or 1 indicates a non-standard socket. Compatibility and designs vary from maker to maker.

====Extensions====

Extension leads are generally four conductor, including pair one and one other pair, wired straight through pin to pin. Some incorporate an adaptor plug which includes a 610 socket, often with all six conductors connected, allowing the extension to also serve as a double adaptor.

====Double adaptors====

Double adaptors are almost always six conductor, wired pin to pin, with a 605 plug and two 610 sockets in parallel.

====Mode 3 adaptors====

A mode 3 adaptor appears physically to be a double adaptor, but the sockets are one 610 and one 611, with pair one of the 610 wired to pair two of the 611, and pair one of the 611 to pair one of the plug. Treatment of the other conductors varies, and may be assignable.

==Standard pinout==

The conductors are numbered 1–6 from the end further from the spigot. The contact terminals are normally labelled with their numbers on rewireable plugs and sockets.

# Pair 2 ring (black)
# Pair 1 tip (white)
# Pair 3 ring (green)
# Pair 3 tip (orange)
# Pair 2 tip (red)
# Pair 1 ring (blue)

Use of pair one is almost always to standard, but pairs two and three may not be present, or the conductors may be used for other purposes. Pair two is often used for local power supply or other proprietary purposes. Adaptors to modular connectors may connect only pair one, or pairs one and two, or all six conductors.

Modems and other equipment supplied in Australia are nowadays normally provided with a modular plug, and an adaptor which connects only pair one, allowing the modular plug to be used with a 610 or 611 socket in need. The pin carrying pair three is often missing completely from the plugs of these adaptors.

===Legacy colour codes===

Legacy installations and equipment most often use either:

* Pairs one and two, connected using four core cable with blue, white, red and black conductors, either solid conductors as two unshielded twisted pairs or flexible untwisted four conductor cable.
* Pair one only, connected using two conductor cable with one white and one blue conductor, either as solid core UTP or flexible two core cable.

====Wiring detail and explanation====

In the early 1980s Telecom would install multiple phone sockets in premises as requested, but charged a rental fee per socket, to cover installation and maintenance. In this era the ringing tone was generated by electro-mechanical bells in each phone and with pulse dialling then in use, the 6xx series plugs and sockets supported separation of the bell circuit. This was to avoid a bell tinkling noise during dialling, from any on-hook phones in the circuit. The standard multi-extension wiring in residential premises thus used 3 wires of the 4 wire cable. White was wired to pins 2 and 3 which were bridged by a link in each socket. Red (bell circuit) was connect to pin 5 and blue was connected to pin 6. The black wire was unused and left unconnected in the socket. Electro-mechanical phones such as the 800 series had their internal wiring slightly adjusted to support such multiple extension use.

When phones moved to electronic ringers and tone dialling, the additional socket wiring using pins 3 and 5 was no longer needed for suppression and the use of only pair one, with white on pin 2 and blue on pin 6 became the standard socket wiring, until being superseded by the modular connector.

==Modular adaptors==

All connection schemes connect pair one to the centre two connectors on the modular connector.

===6P2C===

This is the most common scheme, connecting only pair one:

* 6P2C contact 3 to 600 contact 2 
* 6P2C contact 4 to 600 contact 6

The pin carrying contacts 3 and 4 is generally completely absent from these adaptors, as are the contacts 1 and 5. Equipment such as handsets, modems and extension bells sold in or for use in Australia often arrives packaged with one of these adaptors.

===6P4C===

This is common in extension cables, many of which have built-in adaptors to 6P4C (and more rarely to 6P6C). There are several conflicting schemes, some using pair two in addition to one, others one and three. As most applications use only pair one, most users are unaware of the potential problem.

Even if no modular connector is included in an extension cable, most 600 series extension cables are four conductor. Pair one is always connected, and either pair two or three.

===6P6C===

A common connection scheme is:

* 6P6C contact 1 to 600 contact 5 (pair 2)
* 6P6C contact 2 to 600 contact 3 (pair 3)
* 6P6C contact 3 to 600 contact 2 (pair 1)
* 6P6C contact 4 to 600 contact 6 (pair 1)
* 6P6C contact 5 to 600 contact 4 (pair 3)
* 6P6C contact 6 to 600 contact 1 (pair 2)

<text>The Motorola 68000 series (also known as 680x0, m68000, m68k, or 68k) is a family of 32-bit complex instruction set computer (CISC) microprocessors. During the 1980s and early 1990s, they were popular in personal computers and workstations and were the primary competitors of Intel&#x27;s x86 microprocessors. They were best known as the processors used in the early Apple Macintosh, the Sharp X68000, the Commodore Amiga, the Sinclair QL, the Atari ST and Falcon, the Atari Jaguar, the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) and Sega CD, the Philips CD-i, the Capcom System I (Arcade), the AT&amp;T UNIX PC, the Tandy Model 16/16B/6000, the Sun Microsystems Sun-1, Sun-2 and Sun-3, the NeXT Computer, NeXTcube, NeXTstation, and NeXTcube Turbo, early Silicon Graphics IRIS workstations, the Aesthedes, computers from MASSCOMP, the Texas Instruments TI-89/TI-92 calculators, the Palm Pilot (all models running Palm OS 4.x or earlier), the Control Data Corporation CDCNET Device Interface, the VTech Precomputer Unlimited and the Space Shuttle. Although no modern desktop computers are based on processors in the 680x0 series, derivative processors are still widely used in embedded systems.

Motorola ceased development of the 680x0 series architecture in 1994, replacing it with the PowerPC RISC architecture, which was developed in conjunction with IBM and Apple Computer as part of the AIM alliance.

==Feature map==
==Uses==
The 680x0 line of processors has been used in a variety of systems, from high-end Texas Instruments calculators (the TI-89, TI-92, and Voyage 200 lines) to all of the members of the Palm Pilot series that run Palm OS 1.x to 4.x (OS 5.x is ARM-based), and even radiation-hardened versions in the critical control systems of the Space Shuttle.

The 680x0 CPU family became most well known for powering desktop computers and video game consoles such as the Macintosh 128K, Amiga, Sinclair QL, Atari ST, Genesis / Mega Drive, NG AES/Neo Geo CD, CDTV. They were the processors of choice in the 1980s for Unix workstations and servers such as AT&amp;T&#x27;s UNIX PC, Tandy&#x27;s Model 16/16B/6000, Sun Microsystems&#x27; Sun-1, Sun-2, Sun-3, NeXT Computer, Silicon Graphics (SGI), and numerous others. 
The Saturn uses the 68000 for audio processing and other I/O tasks, while the Jaguar includes a 68000 intended for basic system control and input processing, but was frequently used for running game logic. Many arcade boards also use 68000 processors including those from Capcom, SNK, and Sega.

The first several versions of Adobe&#x27;s PostScript interpreters were 68000-based. The 68000 in the Apple LaserWriter and LaserWriter Plus was clocked faster than the version used then in Macintosh computers. A fast 68030 in later PostScript interpreters, including the standard resolution LaserWriter IIntx, IIf and IIg (also 300 dpi), the higher resolution LaserWriter Pro 600 series (usually 600 dpi, but limited to 300 dpi with minimum RAM installed) and the very high resolution Linotronic imagesetters, the 200PS (1500+ dpi) and 300PS (2500+ dpi). Thereafter, Adobe generally preferred a RISC for its processor, as its competitors, with their PostScript clones, had already gone with RISCs, often an AMD 29000-series. The early 68000-based Adobe PostScript interpreters and their hardware were named for Cold War-era U.S. rockets and missiles: Atlas, Redstone, etc.

Microcontrollers derived from the 68000 family have been used in a huge variety of applications. CPU32 and ColdFire microcontrollers have been manufactured in the millions as automotive engine controllers.

Many proprietary video editing systems used 68000 processors, such as the MacroSystem Casablanca, which was a black box with an easy to use graphic interface (1997). It was intended for the amateur and hobby videographer market. It is also worth noting its earlier, bigger and more professional counterpart, the &quot;DraCo&quot; (1995). The groundbreaking Quantel Paintbox series of early based 24-bit paint and effects system was originally released in 1981 and during its lifetime it used nearly the entire range of 68000 family processors, with the sole exception of the 68060, which was never implemented in its design. Another contender in the video arena, the Abekas 8150 DVE system, used the 680EC30, and the Play Trinity, later renamed Globecaster, uses several 68030s. The Bosch FGS-4000/4500 Video Graphics System manufactured by Robert Bosch Corporation, later BTS (1983), used a 68000 as its main processor; it drove several others to perform 3D animation in a computer that could easily apply Gouraud and Phong shading. It ran a modified Motorola VERSAdos operating system.

==Architecture==
People who are familiar with the PDP-11 or VAX usually feel comfortable with the 68000 series. With the exception of the split of general-purpose registers into specialized data and address registers, the 68000 architecture is in many ways a 32-bit PDP-11.

It had a more orthogonal instruction set than those of many processors that came before (e.g., 8080) and after (e.g., x86). That is, it was typically possible to combine operations freely with operands, rather than being restricted to using certain addressing modes with certain instructions. This property made programming relatively easy for humans, and also made it easier to write code generators for compilers.

The 68000 series has eight 32-bit general-purpose data registers (D0-D7), and eight address registers (A0-A7). The last address register is the stack pointer, and assemblers accept the label SP as equivalent to A7.

In addition, it has a 16-bit status register. The upper 8 bits is the system byte, and modification of it is privileged. The lower 8 bits is the user byte, also known as the condition code register (CCR), and modification of it is not privileged. The 68000 comparison, arithmetic, and logic operations modify condition codes to record their results for use by later conditional jumps. The condition code bits are &quot;zero&quot; (Z), &quot;carry&quot; (C), &quot;overflow&quot; (V), &quot;extend&quot; (X), and &quot;negative&quot; (N). The &quot;extend&quot; (X) flag deserves special mention, because it is separate from the carry flag. This permits the extra bit from arithmetic, logic, and shift operations to be separated from the carry for flow-of-control and linkage.

While the 68000 had a &#x27;supervisor mode&#x27;, it did not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements due to the single instruction &#x27;MOVE from SR&#x27;, which copies the status register to another register, being unprivileged but sensitive. In the Motorola 68010 and later, this was made privileged, to better support virtualization software.
The 68000 series instruction set can be divided into the following broad categories:

* Load and store (MOVE)
* Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, MULS, MULU, DIVS, DIVU)
* Bit shifting (ASL, ASR, LSL, LSR)
* Bit rotation (ROR, ROL, ROXL, ROXR)

* Logic operations (AND, OR, NOT, EOR)
* Type conversion (byte to word and &quot;vice versa&quot;)
* Conditional and unconditional branches (BRA, Bcc - BEQ, BNE, BHI, BLO, BMI, BPL, etc.)
* Subroutine invocation and return (BSR, RTS) 
* Stack management (LINK, UNLK, PEA)
* Causing and responding to interrupts
* Exception handling
* There is no equivalent to the x86 CPUID instruction to determine what CPU or MMU or FPU is present.

The Motorola 68020 added some new instructions that include some minor improvements and extensions to the supervisor state, several instructions for software management of a multiprocessing system (which were removed in the 68060), some support for high-level languages which did not get used much (and was removed from future 680x0 processors), bigger multiply (32×32→64 bits) and divide (64÷32→32 bits quotient and 32 bits remainder) instructions, and bit field manipulations.

The standard addressing modes are:

*Register direct
**Data register, e.g. &quot;D0&quot;
**Address register, e.g. &quot;A0&quot;
*Register indirect
**Simple address, e.g. (A0)
**Address with post-increment, e.g. (A0)+
**Address with pre-decrement, e.g. −(A0)
**Address with a 16-bit signed offset, e.g. 16(A0)
**Register indirect with index register and 8-bit signed offset e.g. 8(A0,D0) or 8(A0,A1)
*:For (A0)+ and −(A0), the actual increment or decrement value is dependent on the operand size: a byte access adjusts the address register by 1, a word by 2, and a long by 4.
*PC (program counter) relative with displacement
**Relative 16-bit signed offset, e.g. 16(PC). This mode was very useful for position-independent code.
**Relative with 8-bit signed offset with index, e.g. 8(PC,D2)
*Absolute memory location
**Either a number, e.g. &quot;$4000&quot;, or a symbolic name translated by the assembler
**Most assemblers used the &quot;$&quot; symbol for hexadecimal, instead of &quot;0x&quot; or a trailing H.
**There were 16 and 32-bit versions of this addressing mode
*Immediate mode
**Data stored in the instruction, e.g. &quot;#400&quot;
*Quick immediate mode
**3-bit unsigned (or 8-bit signed with moveq) with value stored in opcode
**In addq and subq, 0 is the equivalent to 8
**e.g. moveq #0,d0 was quicker than clr.l d0 (though both made D0 equal to 0)

Plus: access to the status register, and, in later models, other special registers.

The Motorola 68020 added a scaled indexing address mode, and added another level of indirection to many of the pre-existing modes.

Most instructions have dot-letter suffixes, permitting operations to occur on 8-bit bytes (&quot;.b&quot;), 16-bit words (&quot;.w&quot;), and 32-bit longs (&quot;.l&quot;).

Most instructions are , that is, the operation has a source, and a destination, and the destination is changed. Notable instructions were:

*Arithmetic: ADD, SUB, MULU (unsigned multiply), MULS (signed multiply), DIVU, DIVS, NEG (additive negation), and CMP (a comparison done by subtracting the arguments without storing the result, setting the status bits)
*Binary-coded decimal arithmetic: ABCD, NBCD, and SBCD
*Logic: EOR (exclusive or), AND, NOT (logical not), OR (inclusive or)
*Shifting: (logical, i.e. right shifts put zero in the most-significant bit) LSL, LSR, (arithmetic shifts, i.e. sign-extend the most-significant bit) ASR, ASL, (rotates through eXtend and not) ROXL, ROXR, ROL, ROR
*Bit test and manipulation in memory or data register: BSET (set to 1), BCLR (clear to 0), BCHG (invert) and BTST (no change). All of these instructions first test the destination bit and set (clear) the CCR Z bit if the destination bit is 0 (1), respectively.
*Multiprocessing control: TAS, test-and-set, performed an indivisible bus operation, permitting semaphores to be used to synchronize several processors sharing a single memory
*Flow of control: JMP (jump), JSR (jump to subroutine), BSR (relative address jump to subroutine), RTS (return from subroutine), RTE (return from exception, i.e. an interrupt), TRAP (trigger a software exception similar to software interrupt), CHK (a conditional software exception)
*Branch: Bcc (where the &quot;cc&quot; specified one of 14 tests of the condition codes in the status register: equal, greater than, less-than, carry, and most combinations and logical inversions, available from the status register). Of the remaining two possible conditions, always true and always false, BRA (branch always) has a separate mnemonic, and BSR (branch to subroutine) takes the encoding that would otherwise have been &#x27;branch never&#x27;.
*Decrement-and-branch: DBcc (where &quot;cc&quot; was as for the branch instructions), which, provided the condition was false, decremented the low word of a D-register and, if the result was not -1 ($FFFF), branched to a destination. This use of −1 instead of 0 as the terminating value allowed the easy coding of loops that had to do nothing if the count was 0 to start with, with no need for another check before entering the loop. This also facilitated nesting of DBcc.

==68050 and 68070==
Motorola mainly used even numbers for major revisions to the CPU core such as 68000, 68020, 68040 and 68060. The 68010 was a revised version of the 68000 with minor modifications to the core, and likewise the 68030 was a revised 68020 with some more powerful features, none of them significant enough to classify as a major upgrade to the core.

The 68050 was reportedly &quot;a minor upgrade of the 68040&quot; that lost a battle for resources within Motorola, competing against projects that had been scheduled to succeed it: the 0.5μm, low-power, low-cost &quot;LP040&quot;, and the superscalar, superpipelined &quot;Q&quot;, borrowing from the 88110 and anticipated as the 68060. Subsequent reports indicated that Motorola had considered the 68050 as not meriting the necessary investment in production of the part. Odd-numbered releases had always been reactions to issues raised within the prior even numbered part; hence, it was generally expected that the 68050 would have reduced the 68040&#x27;s power consumption (and thus heat dissipation), improved exception handling in the FPU, used a smaller feature size and optimized the microcode in line with program use of instructions. Many of these optimizations were included with the 68060 and were part of its design goals. For any number of reasons, likely that the 68060 was in development, that the Intel 80486 was not progressing as quickly as Motorola assumed it would, and that 68060 was a demanding project, the 68050 was cancelled early in development.

There is also no revision of the 68060, as Motorola was in the process of shifting away from the 68000 and 88k processor lines into its new PowerPC business, so the 68070 was never developed. Had it been, it would have been a revised 68060, likely with a superior FPU (pipelining was widely speculated upon on Usenet).

There was a CPU with the 68070 designation, which was a licensed and somewhat slower version of the 16/32-bit 68000 with a basic DMA controller, I²C host and an on-chip serial port. This 68070 was used as the main CPU in the Philips CD-i. This CPU was, however, produced by Philips and not officially part of Motorola&#x27;s 680x0 lineup.

Motorola had announced a product roadmap beyond the 68060 featuring the 68080 rated at 200-350 MIPS, due by 1995, and a product rated at 800 MIPS, possibly with the name 68100, by 2000.

==Last generation==
The 4th-generation 68060 provided equivalent functionality (though not instruction-set-architecture compatibility) to most of the features of the Intel P5 microarchitecture.

==Other variants==
The Personal Computers XT/370 and AT/370 PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes each included two modified Motorola 68000 processors with custom microcode to emulate S/370 mainframe instructions.

An Arizona-based company, Edge Computer Corp, reportedly founded by former Honeywell designers, produced processors compatible with the 68000 series, these being claimed as having &quot;a three to five times performance – and – advantage&quot; over Motorola&#x27;s own products. In 1987, the company introduced the Edge 1000 range of &quot;32-bit superminicomputers implementing the Motorola instruction set in the Edge mainframe architecture&quot;, employing two independent pipelines - an instruction fetch pipeline (IFP) and operand executive pipeline (OEP) - relying on a branch prediction unit featuring a 4096-entry branch cache, retrieving instructions and operands over multiple buses. An agreement between Edge Computer and Olivetti subsequently led to the latter introducing products in its own &quot;Linea Duo&quot; range based on Edge Computer&#x27;s machines. The company was subsequently renamed to Edgcore Technology Inc. (also reported as Edgecore Technology Inc.). Edgcore&#x27;s deal with Olivetti in 1987 to supply the company&#x27;s E1000 processor was followed in 1989 by another deal with Philips Telecommunications Data Systems to supply the E2000 processor, this supporting the 68030 instruction set and reportedly offering a performance rating of 16 VAX MIPS. Similar deals with Nixdorf Computer and Hitachi were also signed in 1989.

Edge Computer reportedly had an agreement with Motorola. Despite increasing competition from RISC products, Edgcore sought to distinguish its products in the market by emphasising its &quot;alliance&quot; with Motorola, employing a marketing campaign drawing from Aesop&#x27;s fables with &quot;the fox (Edgecore) who climbs on the back of the stallion (Motorola) to pluck fruit off the higher branches of the tree&quot;. Other folktale advertising themes such as Little Red Riding Hood were employed. With the company&#x27;s investors having declined to finance the company further, and with a number of companies having been involved in discussions with other parties, Arix Corp. announced the acquisition of Edgcore in July 1989. Arix was reportedly able to renew its deal with Hitachi in 1990, whereas the future of previous deals with Olivetti and Philips remained in some doubt after the acquisition of Edgcore.

In 1992, a company called International Meta Systems (IMS) announced a RISC-based CPU, the , that could reportedly emulate the &quot;Intel 486 or Motorola 68040 at full native speeds and at a fraction of their cost&quot;. Clocked at , emulations had supposedly been developed of a 486 and 68040, including floating-point unit support, with the product aiming for mid-1993 production at a per-unit cost of . Amidst the apparent proliferation of emulation support in processors such as the PowerPC 615, in 1994, IMS had reportedly filed a patent on its emulation technology but had not found any licensees. Repeated delays to the introduction of this product, blamed on one occasion on &quot;a need to improve the chip&#x27;s speech-processing capabilities&quot;, apparently led to the company seeking to introduce another chip, the Meta6000, aiming to compete with Intel&#x27;s P6 products. Ultimately, IMS entered bankruptcy having sold patents to a litigator, TechSearch, who in 1998 attempted to sue Intel for infringement of an IMS patent. TechSearch reportedly lost their case but sought to appeal, also seeking to sue Intel for &quot;libel and slander&quot; on the basis of comments made by an Intel representative who had characterised TechSearch&#x27;s business model unfavourably in remarks to the press.

After the mainline 68000 processors&#x27; demise, the 68000 family has been used to some extent in microcontroller and embedded microprocessor versions. These chips include the ones listed under &quot;other&quot; above, i.e. the CPU32 (aka 68330), the ColdFire, the QUICC and the DragonBall.

With the advent of FPGA technology an international team of hardware developers have re-created the 68000 with many enhancements as an FPGA core. Their core is known as the 68080 and is used in Vampire-branded Amiga accelerators.

Magnetic Scrolls used a subset of the 68000&#x27;s instructions as a base for the virtual machine in their text adventures.

==Competitors==

===Desktop===
During the 1980s and early 1990s, when the 68000 was widely used in desktop computers, it mainly competed against Intel&#x27;s x86 architecture used in IBM PC compatibles. Generation 1 68000 CPUs competed against mainly the 16-bit 8086, 8088, and 80286. Generation 2 competed against the 80386 (the first 32-bit x86 processor), and generation 3 against the 80486. The fourth generation competed with the P5 Pentium line, but it was not nearly as widely used as its predecessors, since much of the old 68000 marketplace was either defunct or nearly so (as was the case with Atari and NeXT), or converting to newer architectures (PowerPC for the Macintosh and Amiga, SPARC for Sun, and MIPS for Silicon Graphics (SGI)).

===Embedded===
There are dozens of processor architectures that are successful in embedded systems. Some are microcontrollers which are much simpler, smaller, and cheaper than the 68000, while others are relatively sophisticated and can run complex software. Embedded versions of the 68000 often compete with processor architectures based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS, SuperH, and others.

<doc id="64837" wikidata="Q466508" url="?curid=64837" title="Rosemary Clooney">
<text>Rosemary Clooney (May 23, 1928 – June 29, 2002) was an American singer and actress. She came to prominence in the early 1950s with the song &quot;Come On-a My House&quot;, which was followed by other pop numbers such as &quot;Botch-a-Me&quot;, &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot;, &quot;Tenderly&quot;, &quot;Half as Much&quot;, &quot;Hey There&quot;, &quot;This Ole House&quot;, and &quot;Sway&quot;. She also had success as a jazz vocalist. Clooney&#x27;s career languished in the 1960s, partly because of problems related to depression and drug addiction, but revived in 1977, when her &quot;White Christmas&quot; co-star Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She continued recording until her death in 2002.

==Early life==

Rosemary Clooney was born in Maysville, Kentucky, the daughter of Marie Frances (née Guilfoyle) and Andrew Joseph Clooney. She was one of five children. Her father was of Irish and German descent, and her mother was of Irish ancestry. She was raised Catholic. When Clooney was 15, her mother and brother Nick moved to California. She and her sister Betty remained with their father. The family resided in the John Brett Richeson House in the late 1940s. 

Rosemary and Betty became entertainers, whereas Nick became a newsman and television broadcaster (some of her children, including Miguel Ferrer and Rafael Ferrer, and her nephew, George Clooney, also became respected actors and entertainers). In 1945, the Clooney sisters won a spot on Cincinnati&#x27;s radio station WLW as singers. Rosemary and Betty sang in a duo for much of Rosemary&#x27;s early career.

==Career==
In 1947, Clooney signed with Columbia Records and cut her first record with Tony Pastor&#x27;s big band, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Didn&#x27;t Say Sorry&quot; b/w &quot;The Lady From Twenty-Nine Palms.&quot; She cut 14 sides with the Pastor band before making her solo recording debut in mid-1949 with &quot;Bargain Day&quot; b/w &quot;Cabaret.&quot; In 1950–51, she was a regular on the CBS radio and television versions of &quot;Songs For Sale&quot;. In early 1951, she had a minor hit with &quot;Beautiful Brown Eyes&quot;, but her recording of &quot;Come On-a My House&quot; four months later, produced by Mitch Miller, became her first big chart hit. Clooney recounted in her memoir that she despised the song, but pop singers in that era seldom had a choice in the material they performed and she risked being dropped from Columbia if she refused to record it. Clooney recorded several duets with Marlene Dietrich and appeared in the early 1950s on &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot; series on CBS. She also did several guest appearances on the Arthur Godfrey radio show, when it was sponsored by Lipton Tea. They did duets as he played his ukulele, and other times, she would sing one of her latest hits. 

In 1954, she starred, along with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Vera-Ellen, in the movie &quot;White Christmas&quot;. She starred, in 1956, in a half-hour syndicated television musical-variety show, &quot;The Rosemary Clooney Show&quot;, which featured The Hi-Lo&#x27;s singing group and Nelson Riddle&#x27;s orchestra. The following year, the show moved to NBC prime time as &quot;The Lux Show Starring Rosemary Clooney&quot;, but lasted only one season. The new show featured the singing group The Modernaires and Frank DeVol&#x27;s orchestra. In later years, Clooney often appeared with Bing Crosby on television, such as in the 1957 special &quot;The Edsel Show&quot;, and the two friends made a concert tour of Ireland together. On November 21, 1957, she appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;, a frequent entry in the &quot;Top 20&quot; and featuring a musical group called &quot;The Top Twenty&quot;. In 1960, Clooney and Crosby co-starred in a 20-minute CBS radio program that aired before the midday news each weekday.

Clooney&#x27;s last major chart hit was &quot;I&#x27;ve Grown Accustomed To Your Face&quot;, released in May, 1956. By this time, Rock and Roll was steadily driving established pop singers from the charts.

Clooney left Columbia Records in 1958, doing a number of recordings for MGM Records and then some for Coral Records. Toward the end of 1958, she signed with RCA Victor, where she recorded until 1963. In 1964, she recorded for Reprise Records, and in 1965, Dot Records.
In 1976, Clooney recorded two albums for United Artists Records. Beginning in 1977, she recorded an album every year for the Concord Jazz record label, a schedule which continued until her death. At that time, Clooney was one of the few singers of her generation who were still making regular recordings. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clooney did television commercials for Coronet brand paper towels, during which she sang the memorable jingle, &quot;Extra value is what you get, when you buy Cor-o-net.&quot; Clooney sang a duet with Wild Man Fischer on &quot;It&#x27;s a Hard Business&quot; in 1986, and in 1994, she sang a duet of &quot;Green Eyes&quot; with Barry Manilow in his 1994 album, &quot;Singin&#x27; with the Big Bands&quot;.

In 1995, Clooney guest-starred in the NBC television medical drama &quot;ER&quot; (starring her nephew, George Clooney); for her performance, she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. On January 27, 1996, Clooney appeared on Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot; radio program. She sang &quot;When October Goes&quot;—lyrics by Johnny Mercer and music by Barry Manilow (after Mercer&#x27;s death)—from Manilow&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;2:00 AM Paradise Cafe&quot;, and discussed the excellence of Manilow the musician.

Clooney was also awarded Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. In 1999, she founded the Rosemary Clooney Music Festival, held annually in Maysville, her hometown. She performed at the festival every year until her death. Proceeds benefit the restoration of the Russell Theater in Maysville, where Clooney&#x27;s first film, &quot;The Stars Are Singing&quot;, premiered in 1953.

She received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.

==Personal life==

Clooney was married twice to Puerto Rican movie star José Ferrer, 16 years her senior. Clooney first married Ferrer on July 13, 1953, in Durant, Oklahoma. They moved to Santa Monica, California, in 1954, and then to Los Angeles in 1958. Together, the couple had five children; son Miguel Ferrer also became an actor. Clooney and Ferrer divorced for the first time in 1961.

Clooney remarried Ferrer on November 22, 1964, in Los Angeles. However, the marriage again crumbled while Ferrer was carrying on an affair with the woman who would become his last wife, Stella Magee. The couple divorced again after she found out about the affair, this time in 1967.

In 1968, her relationship with a drummer ended after two years. At this time, following a tour, she became increasingly dependent on tranquilizers and sleeping pills.
She joined the presidential campaign of close friend Robert F. Kennedy, and heard the shots when he was assassinated on June 5, 1968. A month later, she had a nervous breakdown onstage in Reno, Nevada, where she began shouting insults at her audience. She was hospitalized and remained in psychoanalytic therapy for eight years.

Her sister Betty died suddenly of a brain aneurysm in 1976. She subsequently started a foundation in memory of and named for her sister. During this time, she also wrote her first autobiography, &quot;This for Remembrance: the Autobiography of Rosemary Clooney, an Irish-American Singer&quot;, written in collaboration with Raymond Strait and published by Playboy Press in 1977. She chronicled her unhappy early life, her career as a singer, her marriage to Ferrer, her mental breakdown in 1968, and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder that seriously disrupted her career, concluding with her comeback as a singer and her happiness. Her good friend Bing Crosby wrote the introduction. Katherine Coker adapted the book for Jackie Cooper, who produced and directed the television movie, &quot;Rosie: the Rosemary Clooney Story&quot; (1982) starring Sondra Locke (who lip synced Clooney&#x27;s songs), Penelope Milford as Betty, and Tony Orlando as José Ferrer. The 1944-born Locke was 38 at the time, just 16 years Clooney&#x27;s junior, yet playing her from 17 to 40. Orlando and Locke were the same age, though the real Ferrer was 16 years older than Clooney.

In 1983, Rosemary and her brother Nick co-chaired the Betty Clooney Foundation for the Brain-Injured, addressing the needs of survivors of cognitive disabilities caused by strokes, tumors, and brain damage from trauma or age.

In 1997, she married her longtime friend and a former dancer, Dante DiPaolo at St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Maysville, Kentucky.

In 1999, Clooney published her second autobiography, &quot;Girl Singer: An Autobiography&quot;, describing her battles with addiction to prescription drugs for depression, and how she lost and then regained a fortune. &quot;I&#x27;d call myself a sweet singer with a big band sensibility,&quot; she wrote.

===Lung cancer and death===
A longtime heavy smoker, Clooney was diagnosed with lung cancer at the end of 2001. She died in 2002 at age 74 at her Beverly Hills home from complications of cancer.

===Legacy===
Clooney lived for many years in Beverly Hills, California, in the house formerly owned by George and Ira Gershwin at 1019 North Roxbury Drive. It was sold to a developer after her death in 2002, and has since been demolished. In 1980, she purchased a second home on Riverside Drive in Augusta, Kentucky, near Maysville, her childhood hometown. Today, the Augusta house serves as a historic house museum, allowing visitors to view collections of her personal items and memorabilia from many of her films and singing performances. Clooney also maintained an apartment in the early 1960&#x27;s at the Winslow Hotel on Madison Avenue (now demolished). 

In 2003, Rosemary Clooney was inducted into the Kentucky Women Remembered exhibit and her portrait by Alison Lyne is on permanent display in the Kentucky State Capitol&#x27;s rotunda.

Also in 2003, Bette Midler, after many years apart, rejoined forces with Barry Manilow to record &quot;Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook&quot;. The album was an instant success, being certified gold by Recording Industry Association of America. One of the songbook selections, &quot;This Ole House&quot;, became Midler&#x27;s first Christian radio single shipped by Rick Hendrix and his positive music movement. The album was nominated for a Grammy the following year. 

In 2005, the album &quot;Reflections of Rosemary&quot; by Debby Boone was released. Boone, who was Clooney&#x27;s daughter-in-law, intended the album to be a musical portrait of Clooney, or as Boone put it: &quot;I wanted to select songs that would give an insight into Rosemary from a family perspective&quot;.

In September 2007, a mural honoring moments from her life was painted in downtown Maysville; it highlights the 1953 premiere of &quot;The Stars are Singing&quot; and her singing career. It was painted by Louisiana muralists Robert Dafford, Herb Roe, and Brett Chigoy as part of the Maysville Floodwall Murals project. Her brother Nick Clooney spoke during the dedication for the mural, explaining various images to the crowd.

<doc id="64844" wikidata="Q798062" url="?curid=64844" title="Hydrophone">
<text>A hydrophone () is a microphone designed for underwater use, for recording or listening to underwater sound. Most hydrophones contains a piezoelectric transducer that generates an electric potential when subjected to a pressure change, such as a sound wave.

A hydrophone can also detect airborne sounds but is insensitive of them because it is designed to match the acoustic impedance of water, a denser fluid than air. Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air, and a sound wave in water exerts a pressure 60 times more than what is exerted by a wave of the same amplitude in air. Similarly, a standard microphone can be buried in the ground, or immersed in water if it is put in a waterproof container but will give poor performance because of the similarly-bad acoustic impedance match.

==History==
The first hydrophones consisted of a tube with a thin membrane covering the submerged end and the observer&#x27;s ear of the equipment. The design of effective hydrophones must take into account the acoustic resistance of water, which is 3750 times that of air, and so the pressure exerted by a wave of the same intensity in air is increased by a factor of 3750 in water. The American Submarine Signaling Company developed a hydrophone to detect underwater bells rung from lighthouses and lightships. The case was a thick, hollow brass disc in diameter. On one face was a brass diaphragm, which was coupled by a short brass rod to a carbon microphone.

===World War I===
Early in the war, French President Raymond Poincaré provided Paul Langevin with the facilities needed to work on a method to locate submarines by the echos from sound pulses. They developed a piezoelectric hydrophone by increasing the power of the signal with a vacuum tube amplifier; the high acoustic impedance of piezoelectric materials facilitated their use as underwater transducers. The same piezoelectric plate could be vibrated by an electrical oscillator to produce the sound pulses.

The first submarine to be detected and sunk using a primitive hydrophone was the German submarine &quot;UC-3&quot; on 23 April 1916. &quot;UC-3&quot; was detected by the anti-submarine trawler &quot;Cheerio&quot; as the &quot;Cheerio&quot; was directly over the &quot;UC-3&quot;; the &quot;UC-3&quot; was then caught in a steel net dragged by the trawler, and sank after a large underwater explosion.

Later in the war, the British Admiralty belatedly convened a scientific panel to advise on how to combat U-boats. It included the Australian physicist William Henry Bragg and the New Zealand physicist Sir Ernest Rutherford. They concluded that the best hope was to use hydrophones to listen for submarines. Rutherford&#x27;s research produced his sole patent for a hydrophone. Bragg took the lead in July 1916 and he moved to the Admiralty hydrophone research establishment at Hawkcraig on the Firth of Forth.

The scientists set two goals: to develop a hydrophone that could hear a submarine despite the noise generated by the patrol ship carrying the hydrophone, and to develop a hydrophone that could reveal the bearing of the submarine. A bidirectional hydrophone was invented at East London College. They mounted a microphone on each side of a diaphragm in a cylindrical case; when the sounds heard from both microphones have the same intensity, the microphone is in line with the sound source.

Bragg&#x27;s laboratory made such a hydrophone directional by mounting a baffle in front of one side of the diaphragm. It took months to discover that effective baffles must contain a layer of air. In 1918, airships of the Royal Naval Air Service engaged in anti-submarine warfare experimented by trailing dipped hydrophones. Bragg tested a hydrophone from a captured German U-boat and found it inferior to British models. By the end of the war, the British had 38 hydrophone officers and 200 qualified listeners, paid an additional 4&quot;d&quot; per day.

From late in World War I until the introduction of active sonar in the early 1920s, hydrophones were the sole method for submarines to detect targets while submerged; they remain useful today.

==Directional hydrophones==
A small single cylindrical ceramic transducer can achieve near perfect omnidirectional reception. Directional hydrophones increase sensitivity from one direction using two basic techniques:

===Focused transducers===
This device uses a single transducer element with a dish or conical-shaped sound reflector to focus the signals, in a similar manner to a reflecting telescope. This type of hydrophone can be produced from a low-cost omnidirectional type, but must be used while stationary, as the reflector impedes its movement through water. A new way to direct is to use a spherical body around the hydrophone. The advantage of directivity spheres is that the hydrophone can be moved within the water, ridding it of the interferences produced by a conical-shaped element.

===Arrays===
Multiple hydrophones can be arranged in an array so that it will add the signals from the desired direction while subtracting signals from other directions. The array may be steered using a beamformer. Most commonly, hydrophones are arranged in a &quot;line array&quot; but may be in many different arrangements depending on what is being measured. As an example, in the article measuring propeller noise from fleet ships required complex hydrophone array systems to achieve actionable measurements.

SOSUS hydrophones, laid on the seabed and connected by underwater cables, were used, beginning in the 1950s, by the U.S. Navy to track movement of Soviet submarines during the Cold War along a line from Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom known as the GIUK gap. These are capable of clearly recording extremely low frequency infrasound, including many unexplained ocean sounds.

<text>Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky (; ), better known by his stage name Krusty the Clown (sometimes spelled as Krusty the Klown), is a recurring character on the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa Simpson&#x27;s favorite TV show, a variety show consisting of various kid-friendly sketches and often highly violent cartoons, most notably &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot;. Despite his cheery onscreen persona, Krusty is actually a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most frequently occurring characters outside the main Simpson family and has been the focus of many episodes, some of which also feature Sideshow Bob.

Krusty was created by cartoonist Matt Groening and partially inspired by Rusty Nails, a television clown from Groening&#x27;s hometown of Portland, Oregon. He was designed to look like Homer Simpson (also voiced by Castellaneta) with clown makeup, based on the scrapped original concept of Krusty where Bart worships a television clown who is ironically his own father that he looks down upon; the idea of Homer playing the role of Krusty would eventually be explored in the Season 6 episode, &quot;Homie the Clown&quot;. Krusty&#x27;s voice is based on Bob Bell, who portrayed WGN-TV&#x27;s Bozo the Clown. Krusty made his television debut on January 15, 1989, in the &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;The Krusty the Clown Show&quot;.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky was born in the Lower East Side of Springfield and is the son of Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky. Very little is known about Herschel&#x27;s mother, aside from her name being Rachel and that she died when Krusty was around thirteen years old. Hyman strongly opposed Krusty&#x27;s wish to become a clown and make people laugh, believing that it would distract Herschel from his religion, wanting the boy to go to &quot;yeshiva&quot; instead. However, Krusty performed slapstick comedy, obscuring this from his father. However, Herschel was performing at a rabbis&#x27; convention when one joking rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. When Rabbi Krustofsky discovered Herschel was the clown onstage, he disowned his son and did not speak to him for 25 years. Krusty later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa Simpson.

It was later revealed that Krusty did not have a Bar Mitzvah service, because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by &quot;acting up.&quot; Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies: a Hollywood gala which Krusty uses to stage a comeback after his show is cancelled, then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father. After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield, Krusty started his show biz career as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi (Elvis Presley&#x27;s birthplace). Krusty later discovers that he has a daughter named Sophie. He had met Sophie&#x27;s mother Erin when Erin was a soldier in the Gulf War and he was entertaining the troops. After spending the night together, he prevented Erin from assassinating Saddam Hussein to protect his Saddam-themed comedy act. After that, Erin started hating clowns, and she kept their daughter a secret from Krusty. Krusty and Sophie bonded over time, and while not a full-time father, he is known to acknowledge her birthdays and occasionally references his daughter publicly.

Krusty has his own show on Channel 6 in Springfield: &quot;The Krusty the Clown Show&quot;, which is aimed towards a children&#x27;s audience and has many followers, including Bart Simpson. Krusty has licensed the show to dozens of countries that produce localized versions, including Ireland, China, Jamaica, and Romania with the original version being the least popular. Krusty&#x27;s show has gone through various phases: a clip from 1961 presents the show as a serious talk show featuring Krusty interviewing AFL–CIO president George Meany on the topic of collective bargaining agreements, while a clip from 1963 shows Krusty interviewing Robert Frost, then dumping a load of snow on the poet. The show later takes a different turn, featuring Ravi Shankar as a guest and having Krusty howl a drugged-out version of The Doors&#x27; &quot;Break on Through (To the Other Side)&quot; in 1973. By the 1980s, the show had devolved into a children&#x27;s entertainment show, although in one episode Krusty provided updates on the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands. During the series, the &quot;Krusty the Clown Show&quot; is shown to be aimed almost entirely at children. It features many characters, including Sideshow Mel, Mr. Teeny, Tina Ballerina, and Corporal Punishment. Sideshow Bob begins the series as Krusty&#x27;s main sidekick. However, years of constant abuse lead to Bob framing Krusty for armed robbery, although Bob is eventually foiled by Bart. Bob is replaced by Sideshow Mel, who has remained loyal to Krusty despite being constantly abused by Krusty as well.

Krusty seems to retire from—and then get back into—show business repeatedly throughout his career. One of his retirements is almost made permanent due to just-paroled Sideshow Bob&#x27;s latest scheme: wiring plastic explosives to a hypnotized Bart and sending Bart onstage. When Krusty makes a tribute to Bob, however, Bob has a change of heart and stops Bart from fulfilling his mission. Bob and Krusty later reconcile, with Krusty exclaiming that Bob&#x27;s attempts at Krusty&#x27;s life make his ratings shoot through the roof. This reconciliation remains for the rest of the series, as Bob abandons his attempts for revenge on Krusty in favor of targeting Bart exclusively.
Bart Simpson is one of Krusty&#x27;s biggest fans. In the episode &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; he declares, &quot;I&#x27;ve based my entire life on Krusty&#x27;s teachings,&quot; and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposes Sideshow Bob&#x27;s attempted framing, helps Krusty return to the air with a comeback special, reigniting his career, and reunites Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart&#x27;s assistance, but almost immediately forgets about it — presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits as well as his general conceitedness — and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attends Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp turns out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp is simply a franchise location to which Krusty has licensed his image. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty will show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brings in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushes Bart over the edge. He decides that he is sick of Krusty&#x27;s shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart.

Krusty is a multimillionaire who has amassed his fortune mostly by licensing his name and image to a variety of substandard products and services, from Krusty alarm clocks to Krusty crowd control barriers. Many of these products are potentially dangerous, such as Krusty&#x27;s brand of cereal, Krusty-O&#x27;s, which in one episode boasts a jagged metal Krusty-O in each box. One of many lawsuits regarding these products is launched by Bart, who eats a jagged metal Krusty-O by mistake and has to have his appendix removed. The &quot;Krusty Korporation,&quot; the company responsible for Krusty&#x27;s licensing, has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures, such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfires when the Soviet Union boycotts the games, causing Krusty to lose $44 million. In the TV series and comic books, Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the fast foods restaurant chain Krusty Burger. It has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half-eaten burgers to make new ones, as well as using beef infected with mad cow disease to save money.

Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his cigarettes with hundred-dollar bills, eating condor-egg omelettes, spending huge sums on pornographic magazines and call girls, and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas and betting against the Harlem Globetrotters.

Krusty is a hard-living entertainment veteran, sometimes depicted as a jaded, burned-out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and Xanax. He instantly becomes depressed as soon as the cameras stop rolling; Marge states in &quot;The Sweetest Apu&quot; that, &quot;off camera, he&#x27;s a desperately unhappy man.&quot; Krusty appears to have used cocaine, one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder under his nose; however, he explains that he was simply researching a part for a film in which he played himself. In his book &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, author Chris Turner describes Krusty as &quot;the wizened veteran, the total pro&quot; who lives the celebrity life. He is miserable but he needs his celebrity status. In &quot;Bart the Fink,&quot; Bart inadvertently reports Krusty for tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and, as a result, Krusty loses most of his money. Bart soon discovers that Krusty has faked his death and is living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat. Krusty declares that he is finished with the life of a celebrity and is unconvinced when Bart reminds him of his fans and his entourage. Finally, Bart tells Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status, which convinces Krusty to return. Krusty has been described as &quot;the consummate showman who can&#x27;t bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people.&quot;

In &quot;Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington&quot;, Bart convinces Krusty to run for Congress so that Krusty can introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons&#x27; house. Krusty agrees and runs on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign starts off badly, Lisa suggests that he try connecting with regular families. He does so, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty&#x27;s term starts off badly, as he is completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With the help of the Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeds in passing his bill.

His body features include a third nipple, a veal-shaped birthmark, and a scar on his chest as a result of having a pacemaker inserted into his heart after suffering from a heart attack on-air in 1986.

In the &quot;Once Upon a Time in Springfield&quot;, Krusty&#x27;s age is revealed to be 52.

==Characterization==
===Creation===

Krusty first appeared in &quot;The Krusty the Clown Show&quot;, one of the &quot;Simpsons&quot; shorts from &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; that first aired on January 15, 1989. The character was partially inspired by TV clown &quot;Rusty Nails&quot; whom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening and director Brad Bird watched as children while growing up in Portland, Oregon. Groening describes Rusty Nails as being a sweet clown whose show sometimes had a Christian message, but whose name scared Groening. Dan Castellaneta based his voice characterization on Chicago television&#x27;s Bob Bell who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV&#x27;s Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. Krusty has been compared to an earlier incarnation named &quot;Flunky the Late Night viewer mail clown&quot; who had appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. Jeff Martin, a writer on Letterman’s show, created and played the character. Martin also went on to become a writer on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writing episodes that included Krusty.

Many events in Krusty&#x27;s life parallel those of comedian Jerry Lewis, including his Jewish background, addiction to Percodan, hosting of telethons, and appearance in an adaptation of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. When asked, Groening has simply noted that &quot;[&quot;Simpsons&quot;] characters are collaborations between the writers, animators, and actors&quot; without specifically confirming or denying the association.

Krusty&#x27;s appearance and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that &quot;The satirical conceit that I was going for at the time was that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father&quot;, a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer&#x27;s secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a Butterfinger commercial depicting a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart&#x27;s Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. In the episode &quot;Homie the Clown&quot;, Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as—and is confused with—Krusty.

The Krusty character was originally conceived as just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that &quot;at some point, we decided he looked [like a clown] all the time&quot;. The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty&#x27;s real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; and &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot;. Later episodes made jokes about Krusty&#x27;s face. In &quot;Homer&#x27;s Triple Bypass&quot;, Krusty reveals that his &quot;grotesque appearance&quot; is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, &quot;This ain&#x27;t makeup.&quot; In &quot;Bart the Fink&quot;, he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.

===Development===

The third season episode &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; is the first to establish that Krusty is Jewish. Krusty&#x27;s religion had not been part of the original concept, and the idea came from Jay Kogen. The episode is a parody of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, which is about a son with a strict religious upbringing who defies his father to become an entertainer. In order to make &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; a full parody of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, the decision was made to make Krusty Jewish and have his father be a rabbi. Krusty&#x27;s real last name, Krustofsky, was pitched by Al Jean. Krusty&#x27;s father Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky was played by Jackie Mason, who won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for the episode. It was established in &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; that Krusty is illiterate. This was shown in subsequent episodes like &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot; but the trait was dropped after the first few seasons because it was hard for the writers to write for an illiterate character.

Krusty&#x27;s design has undergone several subtle changes since the early years. For the episode &quot;Homie the Clown&quot;, Krusty&#x27;s design was permanently enhanced and he was given a different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under his eyes in order to distinguish him from Homer. In the episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty&#x27;s design was significantly altered to make him look considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx.

Krusty is a favorite character of several of the original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes. Thus, many of Krusty&#x27;s experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.

In 1992, Matt Groening and James L. Brooks began planning a live-action spin-off from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; that revolved around Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta as Krusty. They pitched the series in 1994. Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot script in which Krusty moved to Los Angeles and hosted his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart, and Groening decided to stop work on the project.

Prior to Groening&#x27;s live-action pitch, &quot;Simpsons&quot; showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss planned an animated Krusty spin-off in which he would be a single father in New York City. Supporting characters would include a prickly make-up lady and a boss resembling Ted Turner. This unsuccessful pitch was later reworked into the animated series &quot;The Critic&quot;.

==Promotion and reception==
Krusty has been included in many &quot;Simpsons&quot; publications, toys and other merchandise. Krusty-themed merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, Jack-in-the-boxes, Pint glasses, bobblehead dolls, costumes, and clothing such as T-shirts. Playmates Toys has made a talking evil Krusty doll, based on the one that appeared in &quot;Treehouse of Horror III&quot;. In 1992, Acclaim Entertainment released the video game &quot;Krusty&#x27;s Fun House&quot; for PC and home consoles. Krusty was made into an action figure, and several different versions were included as part of the &quot;World of Springfield&quot; toy line. The first, which shows Krusty in his normal clown attire with several Krusty products, was released in 2000 as part of &quot;wave one&quot;. The second, released in 2002 as part of &quot;wave nine&quot;, is called &quot;busted Krusty&quot; and shows him in a prison and without his clown makeup, as he was seen in &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;. The third was released in 2003 as part of &quot;wave thirteen&quot; and was called &quot;Tuxedo Krusty&quot;. Several Krusty themed play sets were also released, including a Krusty-Lu Studios and Krusty Burger playset, both released in 2001. Krusty appears as a playable character in the toys-to-life video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, released via a &quot;Fun Pack&quot; packaged with a Clown Bike accessory in November 2015. In game, his only ability is being able to spray water and all his voice lines are archive audio from Dan Castellaneta.

In The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride opened at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2008, Krusty builds and opens a cartoon theme park called Krustyland. Sideshow Bob makes an appearance and tries to murder the Simpson family. In July 2007, convenience store chain 7-Eleven converted eleven of its stores in the United States and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts to celebrate the release of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. Amongst the products sold were &quot;Krusty-O&#x27;s&quot;, which were made by Malt-O-Meal. In 2015, Krusty had its first merchandise experience during the AW15 influence.

In 2004, Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in &quot;Today I Am a Clown&quot;, an episode that heavily features Krusty. Several episodes featuring Krusty have been very well received. In 2007, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; named &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot; as the ninth best episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. John Ortved felt, &quot;This is Krusty&#x27;s best episode – better than the reunion with his father, or the Bar Mitzvah episode, which won an Emmy much later on. The incorporation of guest stars as themselves is topnotch, and we get to see the really dark side of Krusty&#x27;s flailing showbiz career. Hollywood, television, celebrities, and fans are all beautifully skewered here.&quot; Matt Groening cites &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; as his ninth favorite episode and has said that he particularly loves Castellaneta&#x27;s voice work. Groening claims that he has to leave the room every time Castellaneta records as Krusty for fear of ruining the take. &quot;Star News Online&quot; named &quot;Krusty the Clown&#x27;s hatred of children&quot;, Kamp Krusty, and Krusty&#x27;s line &quot;All these rules, I feel like I&#x27;m in a strip club&quot; as some of the four hundred reasons why they loved &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; listed two Krusty products, &quot;Krusty&#x27;s Non-Toxic Kologne&quot; and &quot;Krusty&#x27;s home pregnancy kit&quot;, as part of their list of the three hundred reasons why they loved the show.

In 2015, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated that Krusty has &quot;arguably the most pathos of any &quot;Simpsons&quot; character not named Moe Szyslak&quot;. In 2021, Meghan Markle reflected on her old memorable haircut being compared to Krusty the Clown at &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;.

<doc id="64861" wikidata="Q734898" url="?curid=64861" title="Snowball">
<text>A snowball is a spherical object made from snow, usually created by scooping snow with the hands and pressing the snow together to compact it into a ball. Snowballs are often used in games such as snowball fights.

A snowball may also be a large ball of snow formed by rolling a smaller snowball on a snow-covered surface. The smaller snowball grows by picking up additional snow as it rolls. The terms &quot;snowball effect&quot; and &quot;snowballing&quot; are derived from this process. The Welsh dance &quot;Y Gasseg Eira&quot; also takes its name from an analogy with rolling a large snowball. This method of forming a large snowball is often used to create the components needed to build a snowman.

The underlying physical process that makes snowballs possible is sintering, in which a solid mass is compacted while near the melting point. Scientific theories about snowball formation began with a lecture by Michael Faraday in 1842, examining the attractive forces between ice particles. An influential early explanation by James Thomson invoked regelation, in which a solid is melted by pressure and then re-frozen.

==When and how==

When forming a snowball by packing, the pressure exerted by the hands on the snow is a determinant for the final result. Reduced pressure leads to a light and soft snowball. Compacting humid or &quot;packing&quot; snow by applying a high pressure produces a harder snowball, sometimes called an ice ball, which can injure an opponent during a snowball fight.

Temperature is important for snowball formation. It is hard to make a good snowball if the snow is too cold. In addition, snowballs are difficult to form with dry powdery snow. In temperatures below , there is little free water in the snow, which leads to crumbly snowballs. At or above, melted water in the snow results in a better cohesion. Above a certain temperature, however, the snowball becomes slush, which lacks mechanical strength and no longer sticks together. This effect is used in the rule that, in skiing areas, there is a high risk of avalanche if it is possible to squeeze water out of a snowball.

==Natural snowballs==

Under certain conditions, natural snowballs may form as a result of wind, without human intervention. These conditions are:

* The ground must have a top layer of ice. This will prevent the snowball from sticking to the ground.
* That ice must have some wet and loose snow that is near its melting point.
* The wind must be strong enough to push the snowballs, but not too strong.

In Antarctica, small windblown frost balls form through a different process that relies on electrostatic attraction; these wind-rolled frost balls are known as yukimarimo.

Under other rare circumstances, in coastal and river areas, wave action on ice and snow may create beach snowballs or ball ice.
==Snow lanterns==
A snow lantern is a decorative structure made from snowballs, typically shaped into a hollow cone. It is commonly used as a housing for a light source, such as a candle or a Japanese stone garden lantern known as &quot;Yukimi Gata&quot;. Snow lanterns are part of winter traditions in countries such as Sweden, Finland, and Norway, where they are created and lit during the Christmas season. These structures illuminate the winter landscape and are associated with festive celebrations in snowy regions.

==Literary allusion==
A snowball that turns into a child is a protagonist in a 1969 children&#x27;s fantasy novel, &quot;The Snowball&quot;, by Barbara Sleigh.

<doc id="64871" wikidata="Q1423353" url="?curid=64871" title="Lapin Agile">
<text>Lapin Agile is a famous Montmartre cabaret, at 22 Rue des Saules, 18th arrondissement of Paris, France.

== History ==

The venue existed circa 1860 under the name Au rendez-vous des voleurs, meaning &quot;Where the Thieves Meet&quot;. Some twenty years later, the walls were decorated with portraits of famous murderers and the place became known as the Cabaret des Assassins. Tradition relates that the cabaret received this name because a band of gangsters broke in and killed the owner&#x27;s son in a robbery attempt.

In 1875, the artist Andre Gill painted the sign that was to suggest its permanent name. It was a picture of a rabbit jumping out of a saucepan, and residents began calling their neighbourhood night-club Le Lapin à Gill, meaning &quot;Gill&#x27;s rabbit&quot;. Over time, the name had evolved into &quot;Cabaret Au Lapin Agile&quot;, or the Nimble Rabbit Cabaret. The original painting on canvas was stolen in 1893; a reproduction on timber was painted to take its place.

The Lapin Agile was bought in the early twentieth century by the cabaret singer, comedian, and nightclub owner Aristide Bruant to save it from demolition. The Lapin Agile became a favourite spot for struggling artists and writers, including Picasso, Modigliani, Apollinaire, Roman Greco, and Maurice Utrillo.

The Lapin Agile is located in the centre of the Montmartre district in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, behind and slightly northwest of Sacre Coeur Basilica. Since this was the heart of artistic Paris at the turn of the twentieth century, there was much discussion at the cabaret about &quot;the meaning of art&quot;.

The Lapin Agile was also popular with Montmartre residents including pimps, eccentrics, poorer people, local anarchists, as well as with students from the Latin Quarter and a sprinkling of upper-class bourgeoisie.

== Existing venue ==

The Lapin Agile is largely unchanged and maintains its tradition as an informal cabaret venue. It is located in a stone building on the steep and cobbled Rue des Saules and showcases poets and singers who perform French songs dating back as far as the fifteenth century.

== Legacy ==
Pablo Picasso&#x27;s 1905 oil painting, &quot;Au Lapin Agile&quot; (&quot;At the Lapin Agile&quot;) helped to make this cabaret world-famous. The cabaret has been captured on canvas by other Montmartre artists, such as Roman Greco and Maurice Utrillo.

=== Stage adaptations ===
In 1993 American comedian and entertainer, Steve Martin, wrote a play, &quot;Picasso at the Lapin Agile&quot;, which had a successful run in Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere. The play depicted an imagined meeting in 1904 between Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein at the Lapin Agile.

<doc id="64878" wikidata="Q216393" url="?curid=64878" title="Haaretz">
<text>Haaretz (; originally Ḥadshot Haaretz – , , ) is an Israeli newspaper. It was founded in 1918, making it the longest running newspaper currently in print in Israel. The paper is published in Hebrew and English in the Berliner format, and is also available online. In North America, it is published as a weekly newspaper, combining articles from the Friday edition with a roundup from the rest of the week. &quot;Haaretz&quot; is Israel&#x27;s newspaper of record. It is known for its left-wing and liberal stances on domestic and foreign issues.

 &quot;Haaretz&quot; has the third-largest circulation in Israel. It is widely read by international observers, especially in its English edition, and discussed in the international press. According to the Center for Research Libraries, among Israel&#x27;s daily newspapers, &quot;&quot;Haaretz&quot; is considered the most influential and respected for both its news coverage and its commentary.&quot;

==History and ownership==
&quot;Haaretz&quot; was first published in 1918 as a newspaper sponsored by the British military government in Palestine. In 1919, it was taken over by a group of socialist-oriented Zionists, mainly from Russia. The newspaper was established on 18 June 1919 by a group of businessmen including the philanthropist Isaac Leib Goldberg, initially called &quot;Hadashot Ha&#x27;aretz&quot; (&quot;News of the Land&quot;). Later, the name was shortened to &quot;Haaretz&quot;. The literary section of the paper attracted leading Hebrew writers of the time.

The newspaper was initially published in Jerusalem. From 1919 to 1922, the paper was headed by a succession of editors, among them Leib Yaffe. It was closed briefly due to a budgetary shortfall and reopened in Tel Aviv at the beginning of 1923 under the editorship of Moshe Glickson, who held the post for 15 years. The Tel Aviv municipality granted the paper financial support by paying in advance for future advertisements.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, &quot;Haaretz&quot;″s liberal viewpoint was to some degree associated with the General Zionist &quot;A&quot; faction, which later helped form the Progressive Party, though it was nonpartisan and careful not to espouse any specific party line. It was considered the most sophisticated of the Yishuv&#x27;s dailies.

Salman Schocken, a Jewish businessman who left Germany in 1934 after the Nazis had come to power, bought the paper in December 1935. Schocken was active in Brit Shalom, also known as the Jewish–Palestinian Peace Alliance, a body supporting co-existence between Jews and Arabs which was sympathetic to a homeland for both peoples. His son, Gershom Schocken, became the chief editor in 1939 and held that position until his death in 1990.

The Schocken family were the sole owners of the Haaretz Group until August 2006, when they sold a 25% stake to German publisher M. DuMont Schauberg. The deal was negotiated with the help of the former Israeli ambassador to Germany, Avi Primor. This deal was seen as controversial in Israel as DuMont Schauberg&#x27;s father, Kurt Neven DuMont, was member of the Nazi Party and his publishing house promoted Nazi ideology.

On 12 June 2011, it was announced that Russian-Israeli businessman Leonid Nevzlin had purchased a 20% stake in the Haaretz Group, buying 15% from the family and 5% from M. DuMont Schauberg. In December 2019, members of the Schocken family bought all of the Haaretz stock belonging to M. DuMont Schauberg. The deal saw the Schocken family reach 75% ownership, with the remaining 25% owned by Leonid Nevzlin.

In October 2012, a union strike mobilized to protest planned layoffs by the &quot;Haaretz&quot; management, causing a one-day interruption of &quot;Haaretz&quot; and its &quot;TheMarker&quot; business supplement. According to Israel Radio, it was the first time since 1965 that a newspaper did not go to press on account of a strike.

On 24 November 2024, the Israeli government ordered a boycott of &quot;Haaretz&quot; by government officials and anyone working for a government-funded body, and banned government advertising with the newspaper. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Haaretz&quot; &quot;had published a series of investigations of wrongdoing or abuses by senior officials and the armed forces, and has long been in the crosshairs of the current government.&quot;

==Management==
The newspaper&#x27;s editorial policy was defined by Gershom Schocken, who was editor-in-chief from 1939 to 1990. Schocken was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Hanoch Marmari. In 2004 David Landau replaced Marmari and was succeeded by Dov Alfon in 2008. The current editor-in-chief of the newspaper is Aluf Benn, who replaced Alfon in August 2011. Charlotte Halle became editor of the English print edition in February 2008.

Walter Gross was a member of the governing editorial board and a columnist with the paper from 1951 to 1995.

==Editorial policy and viewpoints==
&quot;Haaretz&quot; describes itself as having &quot;a broadly liberal outlook both on domestic issues and on international affairs&quot;, and has been summarized as being &quot;liberal on security, civil rights and economy, supportive of the Supreme Court, very critical of Netanyahu&#x27;s government&quot;. Others describe it alternatively as liberal, centre-left, left-wing, and the country&#x27;s only major left-leaning newspaper. The paper opposes retaining Israeli control over the Palestinian territories and consistently supports peace initiatives. The &quot;Haaretz&quot; editorial line is supportive of weaker elements in Israeli society, such as sex workers, foreign laborers, Israeli Arabs, Ethiopian immigrants, and Russian immigrants.

In 2006, the BBC said that &quot;Haaretz&quot; takes a moderate stance on foreign policy and security. David Remnick in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described &quot;Haaretz&quot; as &quot;easily the most liberal newspaper in Israel&quot;, its ideology as left-wing and its temper as &quot;insistently oppositional&quot;. According to Ira Sharkansky, &quot;Haaretz&quot;″s op-ed pages are open to a variety of opinions. J. J. Goldberg, the editor of the American &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot;, describes &quot;Haaretz&quot; as &quot;Israel&#x27;s most vehemently anti-settlement daily paper&quot;. Stephen Glain of &quot;The Nation&quot; described &quot;Haaretz&quot; as &quot;Israel&#x27;s liberal beacon&quot;, citing its editorials voicing opposition to the occupation, the discriminatory treatment of Arab citizens, and the mindset that led to the Second Lebanon War. A 2003 study in &quot;The International Journal of Press/Politics&quot; concluded that &quot;Haaretz&quot;″s reporting of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians but less so than that of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2016, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, wrote: &quot;I like a lot of the people at &quot;Haaretz&quot;, and many of its positions, but the cartoonish anti-Israelism and anti-Semitism can be grating.&quot;

== Formatting, circulation, and reputation ==
=== Circulation ===
In 2022, a TGI survey found that &quot;Haaretz&quot; was the newspaper with the third largest readership in Israel, with an exposure rate of 4.7%, below &quot;Israel Hayom&quot;&#x27;s rate of 31% and &#x27;s 23.9%.

=== Formatting and image ===
&quot;Haaretz&quot; uses smaller headlines and print than other mass circulation papers in Israel. Less space is devoted to pictures, and more to political analysis. Opinion columns are generally written by regular commentators rather than guest writers. Its editorial pages are considered influential among government leaders. Apart from the news, &quot;Haaretz&quot; publishes feature articles on social and environmental issues, as well as book reviews, investigative reporting, and political commentary. In 2008, the newspaper itself reported a paid subscribership of 65,000, daily sales of 72,000 copies, and 100,000 on weekends. The English edition has a subscriber base of 15,000.

=== Readership and reception ===
Despite its historically relatively low circulation in Israel, &quot;Haaretz&quot; has for many years been described as Israel&#x27;s most influential daily newspaper. In 2006, it exposed a scandal regarding professional and ethical standards at Israeli hospitals. Its readership includes members of Israel&#x27;s intelligentsia and members of its political and economic elites. In 1999, surveys showed that &quot;Haaretz&quot; readership had above-average education, income, and wealth, and that most were Ashkenazi Jews. Some have said that &quot;Haaretz&quot; functions in Israel much as &quot;The New York Times&quot; does in the United States, as a newspaper of record. In 2007, Shmuel Rosner, &quot;Haaretz&quot;&#x27;s former U.S. correspondent, told &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;people who read it are better educated and more sophisticated than most, but the rest of the country doesn&#x27;t know it exists.&quot; According to Hanoch Marmari, a former &quot;Haaretz&quot; editor, the newspaper has lost its political influence in Israel because it became &quot;detached&quot; from the country&#x27;s political life.

Andrea Levin, executive director of the pro-Israel Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), said &quot;Haaretz&quot; was doing &quot;damage to the truth&quot; and sometimes making serious factual errors without correcting them. According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, &quot;Haaretz&quot; editor-in-chief David Landau said at the 2007 Limmud conference in Moscow that he had told his staff not to report on criminal investigations against Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in order to promote Sharon&#x27;s 2004–2005 Gaza disengagement plan. In April 2017, &quot;Haaretz&quot; published an op-ed by a staff writer that said the Israeli religious right was worse than Hezbollah. Condemnation followed, including from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Reuven Rivlin, and other government ministers and MPs, as well as from Opposition Leader Isaac Herzog.

On 31 October 2024, &quot;Haaretz&quot; publisher Amos Schocken made remarks during a speech at a &quot;Haaretz&quot; conference in London, criticising the Netanyahu government for allegedly imposing an apartheid regime on the Palestinian population and referring to &quot;Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists.&quot; In response, the Israeli interior, education, diaspora ministries severed ties with &quot;Haaretz&quot; while the Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi advocated a boycott of the newspaper covering all government bodies and employees. Schocken distanced himself from parts of comments the next day, saying that &quot;the use of terrorism is not legitimate&quot;. By 4 November, the newspaper had received hundreds of cancellation and subscription termination requests, and a decline in advertising revenue. Several ministries had requested to cancel their subscriptions, with the Israeli foreign ministry cancelling 90 subscriptions.

== Internet editions ==
&quot;Haaretz&quot; operates both Hebrew and English language websites. The two sites offer up-to-the-minute breaking news, live Q&amp;A sessions with newsmakers from Israel, the Palestinian territories and elsewhere, and blogs covering a range of political standpoints and opinions. The two sites fall under the supervision of Lior Kodner, the head of digital media for the Haaretz Group. Individually, Simon Spungin is the editor of Haaretz.com (English) and Avi Scharf is the editor of Haaretz.co.il (Hebrew).

==Offices==

The &quot;Haaretz&quot; building is on Schocken Street in south Tel Aviv.

The former &quot;Haaretz&quot; building of 1932–1973 was designed by architect Joseph Berlin. It was demolished in the early 1990s, with only part of the facade preserved and integrated into the new building at 56, Maza Street.

<doc id="64879" wikidata="Q1504628" url="?curid=64879" title="Lionel Hutz">
<text>Lionel Hutz is a fictional character in the American animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He was voiced by Phil Hartman, and his first appearance was in the season two episode &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot;. Hutz is a stereotypical shady ambulance chasing lawyer in Springfield, with questionable competence and ethics. Nevertheless, he is often hired by the Simpsons. Following Hartman&#x27;s death at the hands of his wife on May 28, 1998, Hutz was retired; his final speaking role was five months earlier, in the season nine episode &quot;Realty Bites&quot;, and has since occasionally cameoed in the background.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==

===Personality===
Lionel Hutz is an ambulance chasing personal injury lawyer and, according to Lisa Simpson, a &quot;shyster&quot; whom the Simpsons nonetheless hire as their lawyer in multiple episodes (a fact remarked on by Marge Simpson in a typically self-aware aside), mostly because Hutz is the only legal counsel the Simpsons can afford. His legal practice, shown to be located in a shopping mall, is named &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s A Law Firm!&quot; and also offers &quot;expert shoe repair.&quot; He often tries to entice potential clients with gifts, including a &quot;smoking monkey&quot; doll, a pen that looks like a cigar, an exotic faux-pearl necklace, a business card that &quot;turns into a sponge when you put it in water,&quot; and even an almost-full Orange Julius he had been drinking himself. John G. Browning of the &quot;Southeast Texas Record&quot; describes the character of Hutz as a literal ambulance chaser: &quot;Hutz typifies the sleazy lawyer. He exaggerates his academic credentials (&#x27;I&#x27;ve attended Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, the Sorbonne, the Louvre&#x27;)&quot; and is &quot;the very worst in legal marketing&quot;.

Hutz is characterized as both a grossly incompetent lawyer and an unethical individual in general. This is supported in his first appearance in &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot;, an episode which also demonstrates his greed as he wants half of the Simpsons&#x27; settlement money. Hutz is disliked and mistrusted by both Marge and Lisa. In &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot;, Marge ultimately testifies against Hutz for hiring Dr. Nick, a quack doctor with a shady reputation, and for making Bart lie about his injuries. Hutz&#x27;s incompetence and greed are also noted by his rival, the more competent Blue Haired Lawyer. In the episode &quot;Marge in Chains&quot; Hutz describes the following as his &quot;problem&quot; with Judge Snyder: Well, he&#x27;s had it in for me ever since I kinda ran over his dog. Well, replace the word &quot;kinda&quot; with the word &quot;repeatedly&quot; and the word &quot;dog&quot; with &quot;son&quot;.

Hutz is characterized as a recovering alcoholic. In one episode he offers Marge a celebratory &quot;belt of Scotch&quot; at 9:30 in the morning, remarking that he had not slept in days. In the same episode, he hastily leaves the courtroom after handling a bottle of bourbon in order to consult his sponsor, David Crosby. He then gives his closing statement, unaware that he is not wearing any pants, and thinks that Clarence Darrow was &quot;the black guy on &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;&quot;. Beyond practicing law, he also tries his hand at selling real estate, reasoning that it was a natural move as most of his clients ended up losing their homes anyway. Out of desperation for work, he has resorted to babysitting. Hutz, left in charge of the children for longer than he was hired, nods off in a sitting position; he produces a switchblade upon awakening suddenly. He burns all of his personal documentation in the Simpsons fireplace, claiming that &quot;Lionel Hutz&quot; no longer exists and he is now &quot;Miguel Sanchez&quot;. His other alias is &quot;Dr. Nguyen Van Phuoc&quot;. Hutz&#x27;s incompetence and financial desperation sometimes lead him to resort to rooting through dumpsters, claiming it is client-related. Hutz was briefly married to Selma Bouvier, although this storyline is not shown in an episode and instead mentioned in &quot;Much Apu About Nothing.” In “Selma&#x27;s Choice,” Hutz attempts to get his hands on the Bouvier sisters’ Aunt Gladys&#x27; inheritance. When he was caught forging Gladys&#x27; signature by Marge and Lisa, Hutz was forced to properly read the will and give Marge&#x27;s family Gladys&#x27; inheritance. Hutz has also been known to use a phone booth as an office.

Hutz does not seem to care about conflict of interest; in &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot; he represents clients in a lawsuit against the producers of a local production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; for not giving them any roles in the play, although he had a role himself.

Another display of his incompetence takes place in &quot;The Boy Who Knew Too Much&quot; when, while representing a French waiter who is accusing Mayor Quimby&#x27;s nephew Freddy of battery, he is surprised when the opposing counsel mentions that Hutz&#x27;s client is an immigrant (despite the client&#x27;s French accent). Hutz then demands that his client tell him everything from then on. Browning wrote that his &quot;courtroom skills leave something to be desired&quot;; in the episode &quot;Marge in Chains&quot;, he motions for a &quot;bad court thingy&quot;, to which the judge replies &quot;You mean a mistrial?&quot;, and then refers to himself as the &quot;law-talking guy&quot;.

===Cases won===
Although Hutz loses most of his cases in the episodes in which he appears, he does win several cases for the Simpsons. In &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot;, he represented Bart when the latter was suspected of the supposed murder of Seymour Skinner, and the charges were dropped when Skinner revealed himself to be alive. In &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;, he represents Homer in his case against the Sea Captain and the Frying Dutchman restaurant over its &quot;All You Can Eat&quot; offer (&quot;The most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;&quot;). He also wins a case for Bart in &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot;, by proving that Itchy was created by an old man named Chester J. Lampwick—though the deciding factor of the case is mainly proven by Bart&#x27;s footwork to collect the crucial piece of evidence, rather than Hutz&#x27;s competence. Hutz initiates the trial with zero credible evidence. In &quot;&#x27;Round Springfield&quot;, Hutz successfully sues Krusty the Clown after Bart consumes a jagged metal Krusty-O from a box of cereal, resulting in an inflamed appendix. After winning the case, Hutz gives Bart only $500 of the $100,000 settlement. In &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot;, Hutz wins a case against Sideshow Bob, who was mayor at that time, for electoral fraud, although Bart and Lisa once again found all the supporting evidence.

The only other case technically won by Hutz was in &quot;Treehouse of Horror IV&quot;, where he represents Homer against Satan (who, in a twist, is revealed to resemble Ned Flanders). In a purportedly-deleted scene for this episode, as subsequently seen in &quot;The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular&quot;, Hutz&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza is free&quot;. After he thinks he has lost the case, he gives the Simpsons their pizza. However, Marge informs him that they did win. Then, he tells them that the box was empty anyway. In the video game &quot;The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&quot;, billboards can be seen around Downtown Springfield promoting Hutz&#x27;s free pizza offer.

==Creation and retirement==
Phil Hartman was first suggested for the role of Lionel Hutz by Simpsons writer Jay Kogen, who liked Hartman&#x27;s &quot;great, strong voice.&quot; Writer Mike Scully described Hutz as a &quot;combination of overconfidence and incompetence. He never doubted his ability in the courtroom for some reason, even though he had no idea what was going on.&quot;

After Hartman&#x27;s death in 1998, Hutz was going to be recast with Harry Shearer, but the character was retired along with Troy McClure, Hartman&#x27;s other recurring character. The last episode to feature Hutz speaking was the season 9 episode &quot;Realty Bites&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Hutz as one of their 15 favorite fictional television and film lawyers. His characterization as an ambulance chaser who is only concerned with money has been viewed as part of a trend away from more noble depictions of lawyers in literature, such as Atticus Finch, and towards more critical depictions of lawyers and the United States legal system. Hutz has also been examined as an example of a fictional depiction of a member of the professional service market in popular culture.

<text>Moammar &quot;Moe&quot; Szyslak ( ) is a recurring character from the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is voiced by Hank Azaria and first appeared in the series premiere episode &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;. Moe is the proprietor and bartender of Moe&#x27;s Tavern, a Springfield bar frequented by Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Sam, Larry, and others.

Grouchy, lonely, miserable, and prone to violent outbursts, Moe is constantly down on his luck and has attempted suicide numerous times. Other running jokes featuring him include being prank called by Bart Simpson, running illegal activities from his bar, his ugliness and his inconsistent stories about his ethnic origin and what &quot;Moe&quot; is short for. Although he is generally quite disagreeable and confrontational, he is frequently shown to have a tender, aching heart beneath his cantankerous exterior.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
===Moe&#x27;s Tavern===
Moe is the owner and bartender of Moe&#x27;s Tavern (informally referred to as &quot;Moe&#x27;s&quot;), frequented by Homer Simpson and other characters including Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Sam and Larry, and his most loyal customer, Barney Gumble. He is not a very good bartender, at one time expressing surprise that gin and tonic can be mixed together. The bar is noted for its depressing atmosphere and uncleanliness. The regular patrons of the tavern have been abandoned by Moe in several episodes in which he changes its target audience. The first of these was &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot;, in the third season. As a running joke, Moe is sometimes seen engaging in unlicensed or illegal activities at the tavern, such as smuggling pandas and an orca in &quot;Cape Feare&quot; and &quot;The Springfield Files&quot;, respectively. Particularly in earlier episodes, the Tavern was frequently prank called by Bart Simpson, who would ask for a gag name which when said by Moe would involve innuendo or insults (e.g., Mike Rotch/&quot;My crotch&quot;, Homer Sexual/&quot;homosexual&quot;, Ivana Tinkle/&quot;I wanna tinkle&quot;, and Seymour Butz/&quot;See more butts&quot;).

=== Personality ===

Moe is one of the darkest secondary characters in the show. He is portrayed with a generally disagreeable personality: he has a short, violent temper, a penurious nature, a crass and undiplomatic manner of speech, and a mood that rapidly vacillates between anger, indifference, and suicidal despair (the latter of which has become more apparent in later episodes of the show). He has an annual Christmas tradition of attempted suicide, but his attempts are comically unsuccessful (landing on a hot-air balloon after jumping out of a plane, for example), and he has already called the suicide hotline so many times that they&#x27;ve blocked his number.

He is easily irritated, frequently threatening the patrons at his bar with a shotgun he keeps behind the counter. He is also gullible, and Bart&#x27;s unending chain of successful prank calls to his bar are particularly infuriating to him, inevitably prompting a torrent of Red Deutsch-style threats of gruesome bodily harm in return.

He also is, however, occasionally shown to have a sentimental and caring side to his personality, such as reading to sick children and homeless people, although he is secretive about such behavior. In his interactions with his various girlfriends, he has also shown genuine selflessness and kindness (as well as an unusual improvement in his disposition), although negative elements of his personality inevitably emerge and ruin things. He has also struck up genuine friendships with both of Homer&#x27;s daughters which have remained in the following episodes. In &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Doomsday&quot;, he asks for salvation, because &quot;I&#x27;ve done stuff I ain&#x27;t proud of. And the stuff I &quot;am&quot; proud of is disgusting.&quot; He donated $25,000 to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. 

=== Relationships ===
Moe has an almost non-existent love life due to his vulgarity towards women and his ugly appearance. Despite this, he has had a number of romantic experiences, including sleeping with his waitress Collette, dating a woman named Renee, and briefly enjoying the company of many women after he had plastic surgery. He also has a relationship and proposed to a dwarf named Maya, but Moe could not adjust to the difference in height, to the point where his ultimate plan to have his own leg bones shortened led Maya to leave him. He has long been infatuated with Marge Simpson, whom he usually calls &quot;Midge&quot;, and has on occasion tried to win her away from Homer, although later episodes have shown him actively working to keep the two together. He has been romantically involved with Edna Krabappel as well as Marge&#x27;s sister Selma Bouvier. Moe&#x27;s romantic attractions have resulted in run-ins with the law; he has stalked Maude Flanders and other townspeople, he must register as a sex offender, and he has a restraining order placed upon him. At one point, he is seen on his way to a &quot;V.D. clinic&quot;. Despite his disturbing approach, Moe has shown to be a caring and devoted lover. While dating Renee (and previously Edna), he wholeheartedly spoiled them with whatever they wanted and vowed to give up his bar and take them away from Springfield forever, even if it means losing his own money and doing illegal acts to make more money. When he thought he finally won Marge&#x27;s heart, he promised to be &quot;the best man she&#x27;d ever had&quot;.

In &quot;Pygmoelian&quot;, Moe and his three closest friends assess him as a gargoyle with cauliflower ears, lizard lips, little rat eyes, a caveman brow, and a fish snout, who is not pleasant to look at, listen to or be with.

In &quot;The Wayz We Were&quot;, Maya returns to Springfield, and she and Moe reconnect, but Moe&#x27;s fear of commitment overpowers him. At Homer&#x27;s suggestion, Moe proposes to Maya, which she accepts.

===Family and biography===
Moe&#x27;s ethnic origins are a running gag in the show, with his origins always varying. The show&#x27;s many conflicting stories as to Moe&#x27;s heritage have been sent up in the tie-in book &quot;The Book of Moe&quot; (2008), where Moe is depicted in several different foreign national folk costumes and commenting on them, including Hungarian and Polish. From early in the series, Moe was depicted as a European immigrant to the United States. In &quot;Much Apu About Nothing&quot; (1996), Moe is depicted taking his United States citizenship test; previously, &quot;Bart&#x27;s Inner Child&quot; (1993) had depicted Moe&#x27;s own inner child chastising him for abandoning his native Italian accent. Later, in &quot;Bart-Mangled Banner&quot; (2004), he reveals himself to be Dutch; he claims his grandfather was Irish while visiting Ireland in &quot;In the Name of the Grandfather&quot; (2009); and in &quot;Lisa Goes Gaga&quot; (2012), Moe describes himself as &quot;half monster, half Armenian&quot;. Moe is also hinted to be Armenian in &quot;Judge Me Tender&quot; (2010), claiming that Armenian Idol is his favorite show. As for indications, he was born in America, in &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot; (1992), Moe claims, &quot;I was born a snake handler, and I&#x27;ll die a snake handler&quot; while in &quot;Day of the Jackanapes&quot; (2001) he claims to have been born in Indiana. Azaria has said he sees Moe as being from Queens, New York City and portrays him with a Queens accent.
Numerous conflicting versions of Moe&#x27;s childhood have been depicted across the show. In &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; (1995), he is depicted as having been one of the original &quot;Little Rascals&quot;, but was fired after killing the &quot;original Alfalfa&quot;. However, charges were not pressed against him as the &quot;original Alfalfa&quot; was, in fact, an orphan owned by the studio. As Homer&#x27;s boxing coach in &quot;The Homer They Fall&quot; (1996), he shows photographs from throughout his own boxing career, stating that his ugly appearance was the result of competing in the sport. Moe&#x27;s college years are also depicted in &quot;Homer the Moe&quot; (2001), which shows Moe as having attended &quot;bar-tending school&quot; at Swigmore University (a play on Skidmore College) before opening what became Moe&#x27;s Tavern. In &quot;Springfield Up&quot; (2007), footage from a documentary called &quot;Growing Up Springfield&quot; shows an 8-year-old Moe claiming that his father was a circus freak. He was unsure which one but liked to think it was a little of all of them. This is further reinforced in &quot;Sleeping With The Enemy&quot; when he briefly asserts himself as a member of the Muntz family. After Nelson&#x27;s father returns, blaming his absence on having been stolen away by the circus due to a peanut allergy disfiguring his face. Teenage Moe is shown again in &quot;She Used to Be My Girl&quot; (2004), where he is depicted working in the school cafeteria, given as his first job &quot;since prison&quot;; Marge is responsible for having him sent back there. &quot;The Seemingly Never-Ending Story&quot; (2006) depicts scenes set years before the series present in which Moe and schoolteacher Edna Krabappel are shown to have had a brief love affair. In &quot;Them, Robot&quot; (2012), a flashback scene depicts a child being stomped on by an elephant, and his face then changes to Moe. In &quot;King Leer&quot; (2018), Moe&#x27;s father, Morty, and his siblings, Marty and Minnie, are introduced, and he is shown in flashbacks as a child in Springfield.

Much like Moe&#x27;s ethnic origins, his full name is also treated inconsistently as a gag. In &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot; (1991), he is called Morris by his lover. In &quot;The Springfield Connection&quot; (1995), Homer refers to Moe in the Arabic &quot;Moammar&quot;. In &quot;Eeny Teeny Maya Moe&quot; (2009), he suggests that he only changed his name to Moe when he purchased Moe&#x27;s Tavern. His last name Szyslak is Polish in origin, and is written as Szyślak.

==Character==
===Creation===
The creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Matt Groening based Moe on Louis &quot;Red&quot; Deutsch, who was made famous when he was repeatedly prank-called by two Jersey City residents. These prank calls were the inspiration for Bart Simpson&#x27;s repeated prank calls to Moe, and Deutsch&#x27;s often profane responses inspired Moe&#x27;s violent temper. Comedian Rich Hall, an acquaintance of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer George Meyer, has stated that he believes further inspiration was drawn from himself and that Groening has verified this to him. Moe&#x27;s surname &quot;Szyslak&quot; was revealed in &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)&quot;. Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein found the name in a phone book and gave it to Moe so that he would have the initials M.S., and hence be a suspect in the Burns shooting. Moe was designed by animator Dan Haskett and his facial appearance was modeled after a gorilla. Animator Mark Kirkland said that he often lets off-model drawings of Moe pass through production because the character is so ugly that no one will notice.

===Voice===

Moe was the first voice Hank Azaria performed for the show. During the time of his audition, Azaria was doing a play in which he had the part of a drug dealer, basing his voice on actor Al Pacino in &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. He used the same voice in the audition and was told by Matt Groening and Sam Simon, who was directing him, to make it more gravelly like Deutsch&#x27;s voice. Groening and Simon thought that it was perfect and took Azaria over to the Fox network recording studio. The result is Moe&#x27;s pronounced New York accent. Before he had even seen a script, Azaria recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;. Moe was originally voiced by Christopher Collins who recorded several lines as Moe which never aired. Azaria explained that he did not discover this fact for several years and that according to Groening, &quot;that guy&#x27;s&quot; acting was fine but other staff and actors found him &quot;a dick&quot;.

==Reception==
In 2001 and 2003, Hank Azaria won Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Moe and various other characters.

<doc id="64882" wikidata="Q745472" url="?curid=64882" title="Mayor Quimby">
<text>Mayor Joseph Fitzgerald O&#x27;Malley Fitzpatrick O&#x27;Donnell &quot;the Edge&quot;/&quot;Joe&quot; Quimby, nicknamed &quot;Diamond Joe&quot;, is a recurring character from the animated sitcom television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, and first appeared in the episode &quot;Bart Gets an &#x27;F&#x27;. Quimby is the mayor of Springfield, and is a composite parody of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and certain other members of the Kennedy family who have entered politics.

==Concept and creation==
Joe Quimby is a parody of Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy and the Kennedy family. Like the Kennedys, Quimby is of Irish descent, &quot;speaks with a Boston accent, throws money at political problems, and vacations in a coastal resort called the &#x27;Quimby Compound. Dan Castellaneta voices Quimby with a Boston elite accent, resulting in a voice reminiscent of that of President John F. Kennedy.

==Appearances==
Quimby has long served as the mayor of the city of Springfield. He appears as a slick, opportunistic politician whose chief priorities seem to be keeping himself in office and various other forms of corruption, including embezzling tax money, taking bribes from Fat Tony, and giving monthly kickbacks to Police Chief Wiggum. The seal on the wall of his office reads &quot;Corruptus in Extremis&quot;, which means &quot;extremely corrupt&quot;. He is a Democrat.

Like Kennedy, Quimby is known as a , and occasionally amuses himself with pornographic playing cards during town meetings. Quimby was once the subject of 27 separate paternity suits. One of the women he impregnated is Cookie Kwan, whose baby is remarkably similar to Quimby in both looks and mannerisms. Quimby also is frequently noticed in bed with the same or similar blonde woman/women, at least one of whom was Miss Springfield. He also once accidentally courted his own niece, which is one of the few things Quimby has ever shown shame over.

Despite being the mayor for such a long time, Quimby does not know or care much about his city, often privately (or even publicly) showing his outright contempt for Springfield&#x27;s citizens. He frequently takes overseas vacations, which take him out of town for extended periods of time, leading to the headline &quot;Mayor Visits City&quot; in the &quot;Springfield Shopper&quot;. He once referred to Springfield as &quot;Springfeld&quot; at a public meeting. However, he makes frequent, albeit short, public appearances for local festivities, events, business openings, etc.

If bending the law will suit Quimby&#x27;s purposes, he will likely do so. He once arranged Marge Simpson&#x27;s release after she was arrested for blocking traffic on a bridge after suffering a nervous breakdown, claiming that if she went to jail, Quimby could kiss the &quot;chick vote&quot; goodbye. He also resorted to bribing witnesses when assault charges were brought against his nephew, leading Bart Simpson to observe that &quot;the system works: just ask Claus von Bülow&quot;.

His catchphrase is &quot;Vote Quimby&quot;, which he always finds an opportunity to say, even in situations where it would be disadvantageous to identify himself, like inadvertently being caught by Homer in a motel room with his mistress.

Quimby was elected Mayor of Springfield in 1986 (three years before the show&#x27;s debut) and has been re-elected several times since, despite openly admitting to fraud and wrongdoing. In the season 4 episode &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot; he admits to using taxpayer dollars to fund the murder of his enemies, but thanks to a clever use of a popular Gabbo catchphrase (&quot;I&#x27;m a bad wittle boy&quot;), he is re-elected in a landslide.
Quimby&#x27;s political stranglehold on Springfield has earned him the hatred of Springfield&#x27;s small but vocal Republican elite, themselves portrayed as mostly dark, ghoulish figures who meet in a castle. When the Republicans nominate Sideshow Bob as their mayoral candidate, Bob rigs the election, briefly deposing Quimby. He is re-instated when Bob is found guilty of fraud and imprisoned. Later, Quimby briefly flees the city thinking his corruption has been exposed and is deemed to have &quot;abandoned office&quot; and is replaced by a short-lived &quot;council of learned citizens&quot; headed by Lisa Simpson, Professor Frink, Comic Book Guy, Lindsey Naegle, Dr. Hibbert, and Principal Skinner. He also survives a recall election, with no candidate in the race against him (candidates include Rainier Wolfcastle (a Schwarzenegger reference), Kent Brockman, and even Homer Simpson) garnering the five percent necessary to force a recall.

==Reception==
Literary critic Paul Cantor has cited Mayor Quimby as an example of Springfield&#x27;s atomistic politics, noting &quot;Mayor Quimby is a demagogue, but at least he is Springfield&#x27;s own demagogue. When he buys votes, he buys them directly from the citizens of Springfield.&quot; During the &quot;USA Today&quot; contest to choose which Springfield would host the release of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Ted Kennedy himself appears in a video in which he invited &quot;Diamond Joe&quot; Quimby and the film to premiere in Springfield, Massachusetts, and even mocked his own oft-mocked pronunciation of the word &quot;Chowder&quot; (as &quot;Chow-Dah&quot;); however, Springfield, Vermont was chosen instead. On May 17, 2013, following reporting on a new scandal, Justin Peters, crime reporter for &quot;Slate&quot; magazine compared the highly corrupt gaffe-plagued Mayor of Toronto Rob Ford to Quimby. Peters prepared a list of 20 outrageous statements, and asked readers to guess which ones were uttered by the fictional Quimby, and which were uttered by the real life Ford.

<text>Chinde is a town of Mozambique, and a port for the Zambezi valley. It is located on the Chinde River, and is an important fishing center. It exports copra and sugar, and had a population of 16,500 in 1980. Chinde lies in Chinde District of Zambezia Province.

==History==
The small town of Chinde, located approximately 40 miles south of Quelimane, developed as the main point of entry for passengers and goods for the British Central Africa Protectorate which was proclaimed in 1891. Because of its favourable location on the Chinde River, part of the Zambezi River delta, it had potential for growth, and superseded both Quelimane and Conceição as the most suitable port of entry .

Until the third quarter of the 19th century, Quelimane, which was linked to the Zambezi river by a shallow channel, was the main port giving access to Central Africa. The Congress of Berlin in 1884 established free navigation of the Zambezi and its tributary rivers, and a number of British missionaries and traders who had started to visit and settle in what is now Malawi traveled there using the Zambezi and Shire River. When the channel from Quelimane became blocked, the search for an alternative route led to the discovery of the Chinde mouth of the Zambezi in 1889. As part of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, the Portuguese government granted the British government the Chinde Concession for 99 years to establish a port where seagoing ships could transfer their cargoes to river steamers. The Inner Concession, which was exempt from Portuguese custom duties, had an area of 10 hectares, with a river frontage of 420 yards. This contained the government offices and the commercial warehouses, workshops and stores. A further 50 hectares without customs exemption, the Outer Concession, was designed to house the slowly growing population of Chinde. The site selected was a sandspit with the Indian Ocean to the south and the Chinde river to the north. A tidal creek virtually separated the Concession from the mainland, making it more of an island than a peninsula.

Chinde briefly flourished as the port for British Central Africa, which became Nyasaland in 1907. At the end of the 19th century, ocean-going ships of the Union Castle and German East Africa lines were met at Chinde by small river steamers which took passengers and goods up to the head of navigation on the Shire River at Katunga, the closest point on the river to Blantyre, the main town in the British Central Africa Protectorate, a journey of around seven days. The African Lakes Company had trading station at the Concession and maintained around six steamers of up to 40 tons on the Zambezi and Shire rivers. Two other British companies had five more steamers of 20 to 30 tons in this route.

For several years before 1922, the erosion of the soft sand in which the Concession was built became an increasing problem. Many of the earlier buildings had to be taken down and re-erected to avoid being washed away or replaced. By the time the port was severely damaged by a cyclone in February 1922 it was already in decline because only relatively small ships could use it and the port of Beira was a better alternative. It would have been difficult and very expensive to restore Chinde fully, but some attempt was made to repair the worst of the damage. However, once the rail link from Nyasaland to Beira was completed in 1922, the main purpose for the existence of the Concession was removed. The British Concession was abandoned and the lease was cancelled in 1923. Chinde returned to Portuguese control: it ceased to serve as a port for Nyasaland, but continued to act as a local port, particularly for the sugar exports of Sena Sugar Estates from the Zambezi valley.

<text>Jeff Albertson, commonly known as the Comic Book Guy (CBG), is a recurring fictional character in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and Eisner-nominated spin-off comic book series &quot;Comic Book Guy&quot;. He is voiced by Hank Azaria and first appeared in the second-season episode &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;, which originally aired on May 9, 1991. Comic Book Guy is the proprietor of a comic book store, The Android&#x27;s Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop. He is based on &quot;every comic book store guy in America&quot; and represents a stereotypical middle-aged comic-book collector with a supercilious attitude and obsessive knowledge of pop culture minutia. He is known for his distinctive accent, disagreeable personality, and his catchphrase, &quot;Worst [thing] ever!&quot;

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
===Profile===
Comic Book Guy (who states Jeff Albertson to be his real name in the episode &quot;Homer and Ned&#x27;s Hail Mary Pass&quot;) is a nerdy, snobby and quarrelsome man. He is best known for his eloquence and crabby, sarcastic quips. He is obsessed with collecting comic books and is an avid science fiction buff. He holds a master&#x27;s degree in folklore and mythology (having translated &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; into Klingon as part of his thesis), as well as a degree in chemical engineering, has an IQ of 170, and is a member of the Springfield branch of Mensa. He is morbidly obese and has long hair, which he always keeps tied in a ponytail.

His catchphrase is the declaration &quot;worst/best [subject] ever&quot;, sometimes to the point of breaking the fourth wall. For example, in the episode &quot;Saddlesore Galactica&quot;, he wears a T-shirt saying &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot;. Another example of breaking the fourth wall occurs in an episode when Comic Book Guy&#x27;s chair collapses, and he sarcastically says &quot;Ooh, a fat man falls. &quot;Real&quot; original.&quot; Despite his solitary life, in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, minutes before his anticipated death, Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting has been a &quot;life well spent&quot;. However, in &quot;Treehouse of Horror VIII&quot;, when a nuclear missile homes in on him, he says to himself, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ve wasted my life&quot;, although the &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episodes are not part of the normal &quot;Simpsons&quot; canon. In the 2008 episode &quot;Any Given Sundance&quot; it was revealed that he is also a writer and posts to his own site called &quot;Ain&#x27;t I Fat News&quot;, a take on the real-life movie review website Ain&#x27;t It Cool News.

===Romance===
Comic Book Guy was once married in an online role-playing game. He and his Internet wife contemplated having children, but that would have severely drained his &quot;power crystals&quot;. In Season 16&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Marrying&quot;, he hopes to wed a &quot;&quot; cardboard figure. While part of an intellectual that briefly ran Springfield in &quot;They Saved Lisa&#x27;s Brain&quot;, he proposes plans to limit breeding to once every seven years (a reference to the Vulcan blood fever of mating, called Pon farr), commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most, but for him, &quot;much, much more&quot;. He is a virgin well into his forties, but becomes sexually and romantically involved with Principal Skinner&#x27;s mother Agnes. He later dates Edna Krabappel after she leaves Skinner at the altar. They are nearly married at a science fiction convention with Skinner and Bart trying to stop the wedding, but Edna changes her mind, preferring not to be tied down to a relationship. Comic Book Guy is not particularly surprised by this, saying, &quot;There are a million valid reasons, but which one did you pick?&quot; When Edna gently explains &quot;It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m DC Comics, and you&#x27;re Marvel&quot;, he accepts the comparison without any rancor. In &quot;Married to the Blob&quot;, Comic Book Guy marries Kumiko Nakamura, a Japanese manga artist. As of &quot;The Dad-Feelings Limited&quot;, he and Kumiko are trying for a baby.

===The Android&#x27;s Dungeon===
Comic Book Guy is the owner of The Android&#x27;s Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop, a local comic book store. The comics, collectibles, and toys he sells are of wildly varying quality and often have very high prices. His store is his sanctuary, where he holds some level of self-esteem, imperiously lording over pre-teen kids, like Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, using a heavily sarcastic tone and often banning certain customers for minor infractions. His store contains a lower level full of illegal videos (which include Mr. Rogers drunk, &quot;Alien autopsy&quot;, &quot;Illegal Alien Autopsy&quot;, a &quot;good version&quot; of &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, and Kent Brockman picking his nose).

In &quot;Husbands and Knives&quot;, the store was closed due to bankruptcy when a rival comic book shop opened across the road, run by an owner with significantly better customer service and social skills. Although his old store was bought by Marge Simpson in the same episode and not returned, Comic Book Guy continues running his store in future episodes and the rival store is usually not mentioned, though it was referred to again when its owner showed up in &quot;Married to the Blob&quot;. Also Bart and Milhouse became managers of The Android&#x27;s Dungeon for a time in &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot;.

==Character==
===Creation===
Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles comic book shop who often &quot;[sat] on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam container full of fried clams with a lot of tartar sauce.&quot; Groening noted: 

Azaria based Comic Book Guy&#x27;s voice on a college contemporary named Mark who went by the nickname &quot;F&quot;, short for &quot;Flounder&quot; from the film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, and lived in the room next door to him at Tufts University. Hank Azaria further explained that &quot;F&quot; would listen to the song &quot;867-5309&quot; all day long and that Mark would keep a list of top five and bottom five people whom he liked and hated in the dorm and post it hourly. Azaria stated that he himself was always on the bottom five of the list because he complained about the playing of the music. Azaria &quot;loves that the character is an adult who argues with kids as if they&#x27;re his peers.&quot;

===Development===
Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of the newsgroup alt.tv.simpsons. The first such instance occurred in the seventh-season episode &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;, in which Comic Book Guy is logging on to his favorite newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive. David X. Cohen often read alt.tv.simpsons to gauge audience response to episodes. He decided to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans.

In the eighth-season episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; after Comic Book Guy views the &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; episode featuring Poochie, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes, &quot;Worst episode ever&quot; on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nitpicks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart Simpson:

The catchphrase further appears on his T-shirt in the eleventh season episode &quot;Saddlesore Galactica&quot;, and as the title of the twelfth season episode &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot;. The catchphrase can also be used for describing other things by saying, &quot;Worst. (Noun). Ever.&quot;

===Name===
A long-running gag on the show was never to reveal the character&#x27;s name, with other characters referring to him as &quot;Comic Book Guy&quot;. The writers had intended to name the character as early as his first episode, but they could not think of a name for him, and they called him &quot;Comic Book Guy&quot;, with the intention of naming the character the next time they used him. However, they continually procrastinated. Finally, in the February 6, 2005 episode, &quot;Homer and Ned&#x27;s Hail Mary Pass&quot;, Comic Book Guy nonchalantly tells Ned Flanders: &quot;My name is Jeff Albertson, but everyone calls me &#x27;Comic Book Guy&#x27;&quot;. Showrunner Al Jean remarked: &quot;That was specifically done to make people really mad. We just tried to pick a generic name. It was also the Super Bowl show. We did it so the most people possible would see it.&quot; Groening stated that he had originally intended him to be called Louis Lane and be &quot;obsessed and tormented by&quot; Lois Lane, but Groening was not present when the writers chose the name. His name is also mentioned in &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;.

==Reception==

Hank Azaria has won several Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, winning one in 2001 for voicing Comic Book Guy and various other characters in the episode &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot;.

==Merchandising and other media==

<text>Barnard &quot;Barney&quot; Gumble is a recurring character in the American animated TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared in the series premiere episode &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;.

Barney is the town drunk of Springfield and one of Homer Simpson&#x27;s friends. His loud belches and desperation for alcohol serve as frequent sources of humor on the show, though Barney sobered up in the Season 11 episode &quot;Days of Wine and D&#x27;oh&#x27;ses&quot; before relapsing three years later. Barney was inspired by the cartoon character Barney Rubble from &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and by several from other television programs. In 2004, Castellaneta won an Emmy Award for voicing various characters, including Barney.

Barney can be seen in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; opening credits since 2009, passed out under a pile of leaves (but still holding his beloved bottle of Duff Beer) and being awoken by Bart Simpson skateboarding over his stomach, causing him to let out his trademark belch.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Barney&#x27;s father, Arnie Gumble, was a World War II veteran who died in 1979 in a parade float accident. Little is known about his mother, except that she lives in Norway and that she served in the United States Navy, including duty on a submarine. She is seen in the season nine episode &quot;Simpson Tide&quot;. In &quot;Treehouse of Horror XVII&quot;, Barney stated that he was Polish, after mistakenly saying he was Irish in a drunken stupor. Barney was born on April 20 (which Homer remembers is also Hitler&#x27;s birthday in &quot;Viva Ned Flanders&quot;) In &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot;, Barney states that he is 40 years old. Several episodes, starting with The Way We Was, depict him as Homer&#x27;s best friend in high school. In the episode &quot;$pringfield&quot;, he claims that he studied dance for several years, including modern and tap.

Two episodes give different reasons for his alcoholism. &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; suggests that Barney was a dedicated student looking forward to a bright future. He had his mind set on going to Harvard University, until Homer peer pressured him into drinking beer the day before the SATs. Season 16&#x27;s &quot;She Used to Be My Girl&quot; attributes his drinking to his high school girlfriend Chloe Talbot leaving Springfield to pursue a journalism career.

In &quot;Homer&#x27;s Barbershop Quartet&quot;, Barney formed a barbershop quartet with Homer, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, and Seymour Skinner called the Be Sharps. Barney was asked to join when the other members heard him singing in a beautiful tenor voice in the restroom of Moe&#x27;s Tavern, replacing the group&#x27;s original fourth member, Chief Wiggum, who had been kicked out. In 1986, the Be Sharps won a Grammy Award for Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word, or Barbershop Album of the Year. Soon, creative disputes arose, and Barney left the group in all but name when he began dating a Japanese conceptual artist. The group realized that they were no longer popular and split up.

Barney was rescued from a tar pit by Bart&#x27;s pet elephant Stampy in &quot;Bart Gets an Elephant&quot; and he also started a snowplowing business rivaling Homer&#x27;s in &quot;Mr. Plow&quot;. Barney&#x27;s commercial defamed Homer, causing Homer to lose his customers. As revenge, Homer fooled Barney into plowing a driveway on Widow&#x27;s Peak, a treacherous mountain just outside Springfield. When Homer saw a news report showing that Barney had become trapped in an avalanche, Homer immediately drove to the mountain and rescued Barney. The friends resolved their differences and agreed to work together. However, a heat wave hit Springfield at that exact moment, driving them both out of business. However, in the episodes &quot;O Brother, Where Bart Thou?&quot; and &quot;Miracle on Evergreen Terrace&quot; it is shown that Barney still drives his Plow King truck.

After being forced to spend a sober night at Moe&#x27;s Tavern serving as designated driver, Barney left town in Homer Simpson&#x27;s car to, among other things, give a guest lecture at Villanova (although, by his own admission, the guest lecture could just have likely occurred on a street corner). He ultimately abandoned the car in New York City and returned to Springfield after a two-month absence. A gag in &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot; suggests that Barney is the father of many local babies born through (presumably, paid) donation of semen and the resulting artificial insemination.

Barney made a documentary film about his life as an alcoholic, titled &quot;Pukahontas&quot;. It won the top prize at the Springfield Film Festival. He was ready to quit drinking after winning the Festival, but unfortunately, the prize he received was a lifetime supply of Duff Beer. In &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot;, Barney trained to become an astronaut for NASA. Under their alcohol-ban, he quickly regained his balance and diction and was quite appropriately selected to fly with Buzz Aldrin. However, he reverted to his old ways when he was presented with a bottle of non-alcoholic champagne. Barney served in the United States Navy Reserve as a submariner on the USS &quot;Jebediah&quot;, alongside his mother, in &quot;Simpson Tide&quot;.

In &quot;Days of Wine and D&#x27;oh&#x27;ses&quot;, after watching a video of his drunken antics at his birthday party, Barney resolves to get sober. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, cleans up his appearance, and attends helicopter-flying lessons. He remains sober by the episode&#x27;s end, though his alcoholism is replaced by an unhealthy dependence on coffee. It was revealed in the fourteenth season episode &quot;I&#x27;m Spelling as Fast as I Can&quot; that he had relapsed.

==Character==
===Creation===
Barney was inspired by Barney Rubble, Fred Flintstone&#x27;s best friend and next-door neighbor from the animated series &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. The writers originally wanted the character to be Homer Simpson&#x27;s sidekick and next-door neighbor, but instead, while still portraying him as Homer&#x27;s best friend, they decided to make him an alcoholic. Ned Flanders would become the next-door neighbor instead. &quot;Barney was taking the standard sitcom sidekick and just making him as pathetic as possible,&quot; said Matt Groening, the creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The writers drew further inspiration from Crazy Guggenheim, a character played by comedian Frank Fontaine on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. Part of the reason the writers went in that direction, according to Groening, was because of &quot;a sort of unspoken rule about not having drinking on television as a source of comedy. So, of course, we went right for it.&quot; The writers also patterned the character after Norm Peterson (George Wendt), a character from the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;.

In some early first season episodes, Barney had yellow hair. Later in the production of that season, the producers had it changed to brown, because they thought that his hair looked like his skin; in addition, during an artistic convention of the show, Groening stated that he wanted only the Simpsons to have yellow hair. Animation director Rich Moore modeled Barney&#x27;s apartment on one he and several other animators who worked on the show shared, particularly the Farrah Fawcett poster and the cable spool table. The writers originally intended for the character to be the owner of Barney&#x27;s Bowl-A-Rama. However, after making him &quot;pathetic&quot;, they could not regard him as a business owner any longer, and it was explained seasons later in &quot;And Maggie Makes Three&quot; that his Uncle Al owns the alley and named it after him.

===Voice===

Barney Gumble is voiced by Dan Castellaneta who said he drew inspiration from Mr. Magoo&#x27;s nephew Waldo on the 1957 record album &quot;Magoo in Hi-Fi&quot; where Waldo was voiced by Daws Butler as well as a little big Frank Fontane&#x27;s Crazy Guggenheim. Early on in the show, Castellaneta discovered that it was not easy for him to do Barney&#x27;s trademark belch every time a script called for it, so he identified his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard, the belch also appears on an episode of The Pitts. Castellaneta has voiced Barney every time he has appeared in the series, with the exception of the episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Barbershop Quartet&quot;, in which some of Barney&#x27;s singing is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans, who recorded lines for all four members of the Be Sharps. Their recordings were intermixed with the cast&#x27;s, often with a cast member singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing backup.

===Sobriety===
Castellaneta thought of the idea of Barney sobering up early in the series. He wrote a script together with his wife Deb Lacusta. They offered their script to showrunner Al Jean. Jean liked the story, but felt that it was too similar to a script the writers were already working on, &quot;Duffless&quot;, so he turned it down. Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes. Their script became the eleventh season episode &quot;Days of Wine and D&#x27;oh&#x27;ses&quot;, which first aired April 9, 2000. The episode was directed by Neil Affleck, who said that he had &quot;a vested interest in getting Barney sober.&quot; However, some of the writing staff was opposed to the episode as they felt Barney sober would not be funny. Castellaneta commented, &quot;He&#x27;s still a goofy man-child...he&#x27;s still got 15 years of booze left in his veins.&quot;

After a long discussion about how the episode should end, the writers decided that they did not want Barney to return to being drunk at the end of the episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe&#x27;s Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character&#x27;s new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.

==Reception==
Filmcritic.com ranked Barney 18th on their 2008 list of &quot;The 21 Best Movie Alcoholics of All Time&quot;. Recognizing the character for his appearance in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Filmcritic called him &quot;the most awesomely funny town drunk in pop culture&quot;. IGN ranked Barney fifth on their list of the &quot;Top 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; Peripheral Characters&quot; in 2006, stating that, &quot;he&#x27;s been a dependable source of humor through his many drunken asides, burps included...Occasionally he&#x27;s sobered up...But let&#x27;s face it, for comedy&#x27;s sake, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is better off with a drunken Barney mouthing off at Moe&#x27;s.&quot; Author Chris Turner (&quot;Planet Simpson&quot;) said, &quot;Making [Barney] sober falls into the trap of all the stuff &quot;The Simpsons&quot; satirizes, all those simple sitcom narratives where everything is wrapped up in half an hour and everyone learns a lesson in the end.&quot;

Britain&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that Barney &quot;should be hailed for making compulsive drinking a source of comedy on US TV, a hitherto impossible dream.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; sixth on their list of the best 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes in 2003. In 2004, Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing several characters, including Barney, in the episode &quot;Today I Am a Clown&quot;. &quot;Days of Wine and D&#x27;oh&#x27;ses&quot; was nominated for a PRISM Award in 2001.

===Merchandising===
Playmates Toys created three Barney Gumble action figures as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first one, released in August 2000, depicts Barney in his usual appearance. The second, Barney in his Plow King jacket from &quot;Mr. Plow&quot;, was released in January 2003. The third, a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us retail exclusive, was released in July 2003 as part of a Be Sharps play set. The song &quot;A Boozehound named Barney&quot; from the episode &quot;Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious&quot; was included on the &quot;Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons&quot; album. Barney plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. During the pre-show, Barney appears in a suit of the character Scratchy to entertain the people waiting in line, but he staggers around drunk and drinks in public, which led to Krusty firing him for drinking on the job. Barney later reappears during the ride portion where he appears outside Moe&#x27;s Tavern, letting out his signature belch as the Simpson family chases an enlarged Maggie through Springfield.

<doc id="64893" wikidata="Q1408697" url="?curid=64893" title="Apu Nahasapeemapetilon">
<text>Apu Nahasapeemapetilon is a recurring character in the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is an Indian immigrant proprietor who runs the Kwik-E-Mart, a popular convenience store in Springfield, and is known for his catchphrase, &quot;Thank you, come again&quot;. He was voiced by Hank Azaria and first appeared in the episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. He was named in honor of the title character of &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; by Satyajit Ray.

A 2017 documentary, &quot;The Problem with Apu&quot;, written by and starring comedian Hari Kondabolu, criticized the character as a South Asian stereotype. In January 2020, Azaria reacted to this by announcing that he and the production crew of the series had agreed for him to step down as the voice of Apu. The final time that Azaria voiced Apu was in the season 29 premiere &quot;The Serfsons&quot; in 2017; since then, he has appeared as a background character.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
===Biography===
In the episode &quot;Homer and Apu&quot;, Apu says he is from Rahmatpur, West Bengal. Apu is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and he holds a Ph.D. in computer science. He graduated first in his class of seven million at &#x27;Caltech&#x27; – Calcutta Technical Institute – going on to earn his doctorate at the Springfield Heights Institute of Technology.

Apu began working at the Kwik-E-Mart during graduate school to pay off his student loan; he stayed afterwards as he enjoyed his job and the friends he had made. He remained an illegal immigrant until Mayor Quimby proposed a municipal law to expel all undocumented aliens. Apu responded by purchasing a forged birth certificate from the Springfield Mafia that listed his parents as American citizens Herb and Judy Nahasapeemapetilon from Green Bay, Wisconsin. When, however, he realized he was forsaking his origins, he abandoned this plan and instead successfully managed to pass his citizenship test with help from Lisa and Homer Simpson. Thus, he refers to himself as a &quot;semi-legal alien&quot;.

In 1985, Apu was a member of the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, along with Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, and Principal Seymour Skinner. Upon the advice of the band manager, Nigel, Apu took the stage name &quot;Apu de Beaumarchais&quot; (a reference to Pierre Beaumarchais, author of &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;). Apu is a dietary vegan, as revealed in the season 7 episode &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot;.

===Family===
In the episode &quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons&quot;, Apu enjoys a brief period as Springfield&#x27;s leading ladies&#x27; man after being spontaneously drawn into a bachelor auction. He spends the days following the auction on a whirlwind of dates, which suddenly ends when his mother announces his arranged marriage to a woman named Manjula, whom he had not seen since childhood. Apu tries to get out of the arrangement at first, with Marge Simpson pretending to be his wife, until Apu&#x27;s mother finds her with Homer. However, he is won over when he meets Manjula at the wedding, and the two decide to give the marriage a try, with Manjula noting nonchalantly that they can always get a divorce. Later, the two actually fall in love.

In the episode &quot;Eight Misbehavin&#x27;, Manjula receives too many doses of fertility drugs, leading to her giving birth to octuplets: Anoop, Uma, Nabendu, Poonam, Pria, Sandeep, Sashi, and Gheet. This causes difficulties for the family but finally they decide to get on with their life. During the episode &quot;Bart-Mangled Banner&quot;, when the town changes its name to Libertyville to be patriotic after it is claimed Springfield hates America, Apu temporarily changes his children&#x27;s names to Lincoln, Freedom, Condoleezza, Coke, Pepsi, Manifest Destiny, Apple Pie, and Superman.

Apu and Manjula have a mostly happy marriage, despite understandable marital problems caused by Apu&#x27;s workaholic nature and long hours, and the strain of caring for eight children. A strain came up when Manjula learned that Apu works longer than he needs to, resulting in Apu showering Manjula with many gifts. A further strain came up when Apu was unfaithful to Manjula, causing him to briefly move out and even making him contemplate suicide. He and his family are devout Hindus, and he particularly venerates Ganesha.

Sanjay (voiced by Harry Shearer), Apu&#x27;s brother, helps run the Kwik-E-Mart. Sanjay has a daughter named Pahasatira, and a son named Jamshed, all of whom share the Nahasapeemapetilon surname. Apu has another younger brother, who is only mentioned in &quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons&quot;, where Apu was shown on a chart as the oldest of three. Apu also has a cousin living in India named Kavi, also voiced by Azaria, who helped Homer while he was in India. Kavi works for several American companies taking service calls using General American, cowboy, and Jamaican accents.

===Other appearances===
Apu is a playable character in &quot;The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&quot; video game. His quest in the game is to redeem himself for unknowingly selling the tainted Buzz Cola that has made the residents of Springfield insane. Apu also makes an appearance in &quot;The Simpsons: Road Rage&quot; as a passenger and unlockable playable character. He also is a character players acquire fairly early on in the open-ended online game &quot;The Simpsons: Tapped Out&quot;. In 2015, Apu appeared as a non-playable character in the toys-to-life video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. In game, he only appears in the Simpsons levels and does not speak at all.

==Character==

Apu first appeared in the season one episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. Al Jean and Mike Reiss claim that while creating the character, the writers decided they would not make him ethnic, as they felt it would be too offensive and stereotypical and did not want to offend viewers, but that the concept stayed because Hank Azaria&#x27;s reading of the line &quot;Hello, Mr. Homer&quot; received a huge laugh from the writers. Azaria, however, has disputed this account, claiming instead that the writers asked him to create a stereotypical Indian accent for the character. Azaria has said that he based Apu&#x27;s voice on Indian convenience store workers in Los Angeles with whom he had interacted when he first moved to the area. He also loosely based it on Peter Sellers&#x27; character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film &quot;The Party&quot;, who Azaria thinks has a similar personality to Apu.

Apu&#x27;s first name is a homage to the main character in &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;, directed by Satyajit Ray. His surname is a scrambled version of &quot;Pahasadee Napetilon&quot;, the full name of a schoolmate of &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Jeff Martin. It was first used in the episode &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;.

In the ninth season of the show, Apu marries Manjula in the episode &quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons&quot;. Rich Appel first constructed the idea for Apu&#x27;s marriage. Andrea Martin provided the voice of Apu&#x27;s mother in the episode, recording her part in New York. She wanted to get the voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu&#x27;s mother&#x27;s.

==Reception==
===Popularity===
Apu, while being seen by some as a caricature, is one of the most prominent South Asian characters on primetime television in the United States. Hank Azaria has won three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, winning in 1998 for his performance as Apu, again in 2001 for &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot;, and a third time in 2003 for &quot;Moe Baby Blues&quot; for voicing several characters, including Apu.

Apu&#x27;s image has been widely licensed, on items ranging from board games to automobile air fresheners. In July 2007, convenience store chain 7-Eleven converted 11 of its stores in the United States and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts to celebrate the release of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;.

===Accusations of racial stereotyping===
Apu&#x27;s portrayal has been accused by many as being a racist caricature of Indians and South Asians in general and was criticized as showing bias along racial/ethnic lines and called &quot;brownvoice&quot; (similar to &quot;blackface&quot;). During the 2007 7-Eleven promotion, many Indian-Americans voiced concerns that Apu is a caricature and plays on too many negative stereotypes. Despite this, 7-Eleven reported that many of its Indian employees reacted positively to the idea, but noted that it was &quot;not a 100 percent endorsement&quot;.
According to Kondabolu, in a &quot;Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell&quot; web-exclusive segment, there were negative reactions to Apu in the Indian-American community, as well as the greater Desi community. Pakistani-American comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani has also criticized the character, relating that early in his career, he was asked to do &quot;the Apu accent&quot;, a stereotyped version of the speech patterns of Indians. In a 2007 interview, Azaria acknowledged some of this criticism when he recalled a conversation with the writers of the show during the inception of the character: &quot;Right away they were like &#x27;Can you do an Indian accent and how offensive can you make it?&#x27; basically. I was like, &#x27;It&#x27;s not tremendously accurate. It&#x27;s a little, uh, stereotype,&#x27; and they were like, &#x27;Eh, that&#x27;s all right. In a 2013 interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Azaria said it should not be expected that the character&#x27;s accent would &quot;suddenly change now&quot; or that the character would be written out, saying, &quot;I&#x27;d be surprised if [the show&#x27;s writers] write him any less frequently because he&#x27;s offensive.&quot;

In 2016, Kondabolu announced his intention to produce a documentary about &quot;how this controversial caricature was created, burrowed its way into the hearts and minds of Americans and continues to exist – intact – twenty-six years later&quot;. In 2017, Kondabolu released the hour-long documentary &quot;The Problem with Apu&quot;, in which he interviews actors and comics of South Asian heritage about the impact that the character of Apu has had on their lives and the perception of South Asians in American culture.

In April 2018, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; reacted to the controversy surrounding Apu in the episode &quot;No Good Read Goes Unpunished&quot;. Marge introduces Lisa to her favorite childhood book, but is shocked by its racist stereotypes and attempts to rewrite it to suit modern sensitivities. Lisa is bored by this revised version, and Marge asks what she should do; Lisa replies &quot;It&#x27;s hard to say. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?&quot; She then looks at a picture of Apu with &quot;Don&#x27;t have a cow, man&quot; written on it, and the two characters say that the issue will be dealt with later, if at all. Kondabolu said that he was saddened by the show&#x27;s dismissive take on the controversy. Mike Reiss, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; longtime writer and producer, acknowledged the problem, and pointed out that Apu had not had a line in the show for the last three years.

During an appearance that same month on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, Azaria said that he would be &quot;perfectly willing to step aside&quot; from the role of voicing Apu, saying that he was increasingly worried about the character causing harm by reinforcing stereotypes and that &quot;the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it ... I really want to see Indian, South Asian writers in the writers&#x27; room, genuinely informing whichever direction this character takes.&quot; Kondabolu had a positive reaction to Azaria&#x27;s comments.

In an interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, creator Matt Groening dismissed the criticism of the Apu character, saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a time in our culture where people love to pretend they&#x27;re offended&quot;. Dana Walden, the CEO of 20th Century Fox Television, said in an August 2018 interview in regard to the Apu controversy that the network trusts the showrunners &quot;to handle it in the way that&#x27;s best for the show&quot;. In October 2018, in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;The Problem with a Poo&quot;, Mr. Hankey is expelled and sent to a land where &quot;people don&#x27;t care about bigotry and hate&quot; – Springfield. The episode ended with a title card, #cancelthesimpsons, similar to the promo for &quot;South Park&quot; that called for the cancellation of itself. That said, on the DVD commentary South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone stated that the people on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; are their friends and that joke was not a jab at &quot;The Simpsons&quot; but at the documentary and that they found it amusing how many misinterpreted the joke as an attack on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Al Jean also tweeted about the episode &quot;It&#x27;s actually in favor of us saying people are too critical.&quot;

In the UK, Hugo Rifkind criticized in &quot;The Times&quot; what he characterized as the prevalent attitude concerning potentially offensive material: that the possibility that somebody &quot;might be&quot; offended is enough for material to be considered offensive. He also stated that Apu is portrayed very positively, smarter than every other character except for Lisa, and that the show was much ruder about other characters like Ned Flanders, Krusty and Groundskeeper Willie.

On October 26, Adi Shankar stated in an interview with &quot;IndieWire&quot; that Apu would be leaving &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. On October 29, 2018, executive producer Al Jean responded to the speculation and stated that &quot;Adi Shankar is not a producer on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. I wish him the best but he does not speak for our show&quot;. On August 27, 2019, several sources reported that Groening had confirmed Apu&#x27;s continued position on the show during the &quot;Simpsons&quot; panel at Disney&#x27;s D23 Expo, telling a fan who asked whether or not Apu would remain, &quot;Yes. We love Apu. We&#x27;re proud of Apu.&quot;

Azaria announced on January 17, 2020, that he and the production team agreed to allow him to step away from voicing Apu, &quot;unless there&#x27;s some way to transition it or something&quot;. Azaria had followed the debate over the previous years since Kondabolu&#x27;s essay and documentary, read up on and attended seminars on racism and social consciousness, and spoken to Indian-American colleagues including fellow actor Utkarsh Ambudkar (who had performed as Apu&#x27;s nephew in &quot;Much Apu About Something&quot;) about the situation. He came to understand the issues around the character of Apu compared to the other stereotypical characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was the idea of permissible use, which led to his decision to quit voicing Apu. Azaria said, &quot;There hasn&#x27;t been an outcry over these characters because people feel they&#x27;re represented. They don&#x27;t take it so personally, nor do they feel oppressed or insulted by it.&quot;

On June 26, 2020, it was stated that &quot;Moving forward, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; will no longer have white actors voice non-white characters.&quot; This follows Mike Henry stating that he will no longer voice the African-American character Cleveland Brown on fellow Fox animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and Jenny Slate and Kristen Bell&#x27;s announcement that they will no longer voice mixed-race characters on &quot;Big Mouth&quot; and &quot;Central Park&quot;, respectively. There were plans for the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon to make an appearance in season 33. However, &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening stated &quot;we have to see if we can make the stories work&quot;. 

In the April 12, 2021, episode of Dax Shepard&#x27;s podcast &quot;Armchair Expert&quot;, Azaria apologized for &quot;racism, my participation in racism, or at least in a racist practice or in structural racism, as it relates to showbusiness or...all the above.&quot; One reaction to Azaria&#x27;s apology came from actress/writer Mellini Kantayya, who, in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion piece, wrote that hearing Azaria&#x27;s concession &quot;and for him to say so not in a carefully crafted PR statement, but in a conversation long after the news cycle had moved on, caught me off guard. Azaria reached his conclusions after years of learning and reflection. He recognized how his work had hurt Indian Americans and wanted to start making amends. That&#x27;s why I cried. His apology was cold comfort, given my past, but the validation and acknowledgment still mattered.&quot;

In 2022, comedian Akaash Singh made a comedy stand up special called &quot;Bring Back Apu&quot;, where he claims that the character is &quot;not racist&quot;, and represented the American Dream.

In April 2023, Azaria and Kondabolu did a joint interview on the topic with the radio program &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

<text>Reverend Timothy &quot;Tim&quot; Lovejoy, Jr. is a recurring character in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is voiced by Harry Shearer, and first appeared in the episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;.

Rev. Lovejoy is the minister at The First Church of Springfield—the Protestant church (mostly Mainline) in Springfield. Initially kind-hearted and ambitious, Lovejoy has become somewhat bitter and apathetic towards other people and religion because of Ned Flanders&#x27;s chronic, over-the-top scrupulosity.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
===Profile===
Lovejoy is the pastor of the Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism First Church of Springfield, which most of the show&#x27;s characters regularly attend. He attended Texas Christian University. He initially came to Springfield in the 1970s as an eager, enthusiastic, young man, only to become cynical and disillusioned about his ministry, mostly due to Ned Flanders, who constantly pesters him with minor issues such as &quot;coveting his own wife&quot; or thinking that he &quot;swallowed a toothpick&quot;.

Lovejoy would deal with Flanders&#x27; concerns very briefly, so that he could return to playing with his model trains. At one point, Lovejoy &quot;just stopped caring&quot;, but rediscovered the joy of helping others, though Ned still irritates him. Lovejoy even suggests Ned join another religion, as he believes that &quot;they are all pretty much the same&quot;. In the season two episode &quot;Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment&quot;, Lovejoy helps Lisa with her family&#x27;s illegal cable hookup.

His sermons vary between dreary recitations of more opaque parts of the Old Testament, to the occasional &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; about Hell. He disapproves of popular music, as shown in &quot;Bart Sells His Soul&quot; when Bart gets the congregation to sing &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; as an opening hymn; he punishes Bart for the prank by making him clean the organ pipes that he has &quot;befouled&quot;.

===Acceptance for other religions===
Lovejoy demonstrates his acceptance for Hinduism when he performs a Hindu marriage ceremony for Kwik-E-Mart shopkeeper Apu (though Lovejoy does not know much about the faith, referring to it in an earlier episode as &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;), co-hosts a religious radio program with Krusty the Klown&#x27;s rabbi father, and admits evolution may be true. However, he does not tolerate Buddhism, as when Lisa Simpson converted to it, he referred to her as &quot;Marge Simpson&#x27;s devil-daughter&quot;. He also appears bitter about the tall Episcopal church across the street, wanting to build a larger steeple, and when mentioning the other church, placing the emphasis on &quot;pis&quot;. He maintains two rolodexes – one for Christians, and one for non-Christians. While he seems to have originally accepted evolution, he later advocates for creationism at his church to beef up its membership.

He does not accept Roman Catholicism either, as he is shown brawling with a priest. He tells Marge that he might as well do a Voodoo dance for Abe Simpson when asked to give him the last rites. He also helps kidnap Bart to keep him from converting to Catholicism. Lovejoy also claims in &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Marrying&quot; to various same-sex couples who arrive at his church to get married that &quot;while I have no opinion for or against your sinful lifestyle, I cannot marry two people of the same sex anymore than I could put a hamburger on a hot dog bun&quot; and tells them to &quot;go back to behind the scenes of every facade of entertainment.&quot; When Marge objects, Lovejoy tells her the Bible forbids same-sex relationships, but when Marge asks which book in Bible forbids it, he merely claims &quot;The Bible&quot; and then continuously rings the church bell after Marge continues to press him on the matter.

===Negative qualities===
Lovejoy has been shown to do things that would be considered sinful. Lovejoy has been known to exploit his congregation for money, brawl with a Roman Catholic priest, encourage his pet Old English Sheepdog to foul Ned Flanders&#x27;s lawn, and implied that he once burned down his church for insurance money. In &quot;Whacking Day&quot;, he made up a passage in the Bible to attempt to convince Lisa that &quot;even God himself endorses Whacking Day&quot;. In &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot;, the episode in which the whole town of Springfield is deceived into joining a cult, Lovejoy kidnaps Homer with Groundskeeper Willie from the cult and hits him across the head numerous times hoping to knock him out. Also, when Lovejoy sees the spaceship emerge from the &quot;forbidden barn&quot; he throws his religious collar on the ground. After it is revealed that the spaceship is fake, Ned Flanders notices his collar on the ground and informs Lovejoy, who picks it up and puts it back on.

Lovejoy is not always enthusiastic about the Bible, calling it a &quot;2000-page sleeping pill&quot;. It is unsure if he even owns a Bible, as it was once said he borrows one from the library every week. Sometimes he holds strange positions on the Bible and makes theological errors. In &quot;Secrets of a Successful Marriage,&quot; an episode that dealt with marriage counseling, Lovejoy and his gossipy wife, Helen, both recommend that Marge should divorce Homer. Marge objects to this, pointing out how the Bible has strict guidelines against things like divorce, but Lovejoy claims, &quot;Marge, &quot;everything&quot; is a sin. &quot;(holds up the Bible)&quot; Have you ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we&#x27;re not allowed to go to the bathroom.&quot; However, despite these opinions, he is still deeply knowledgeable about the Bible, being able to recite a random passage purely from memory after Homer mentioned its number.

===Family===
Lovejoy&#x27;s wife Helen was originally portrayed as a moralistic, judgmental gossip, but in voice actress Maggie Roswell&#x27;s long absence, her character was seen but not heard. The Lovejoys&#x27; manipulative daughter Jessica was the focus of the episode &quot;Bart&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot; where she was voiced by guest star Meryl Streep, but is otherwise rarely seen.
Lovejoy&#x27;s father is briefly shown in the episode &quot;Bart After Dark&quot; as an older version of Lovejoy (including clerical collar) who visits the Maison Derrière.

==Creation and reception==
Matt Groening has indicated that Lovejoy is named after Lovejoy Street (which in turn is named for Portland co-founder Asa Lovejoy) in Portland, Oregon, the city where Groening grew up. When the character was created, producer Sam Simon did not want Lovejoy to be a &quot;cartoony hypocritical preacher&quot; but rather &quot;a realistic person who just happened to work as a minister,&quot; as recalled by writer Al Jean. By season eight, the show had begun to explore secondary characters with Lovejoy being the central character in the episode &quot;In Marge We Trust&quot; because, aside from being noted as &quot;the pastor who didn&#x27;t care&quot;, he had not had much character development. Author Mark I. Pinsky writes of Lovejoy as &quot;a foil in the series, personifying many of the failings of organized religion and Christian conservatism,&quot; and yet still a real human with faults and not simply evil. Harry Shearer has stated that his voice for the character is based on Ernest Angley.

<doc id="64898" wikidata="Q1504586" url="?curid=64898" title="Dr. Hibbert">
<text>Julius M. Hibbert, M.D. is a recurring character on the television animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is Springfield&#x27;s most prominent medical professional. Although he has a kind and warm persona, he is also often characterized as greedy and lacking in empathy. His signature character trait is his often-inappropriate chuckling, which is generally cued by misfortune rather than something genuinely amusing. The character debuted on December 6, 1990, in the episode Bart the Daredevil. He was voiced from his debut by &quot;Simpsons&quot; regular Harry Shearer, and since a recasting of all of the show&#x27;s non-white characters, by Kevin Michael Richardson from 2021.

==Profile==
He is near-genius (with an IQ of 155), a Mensa member, a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and a former stripper. Hibbert is noticeably less dysfunctional than just about everyone else on the show, though he does have a bizarre tendency to chuckle at inappropriate moments which is later revealed to be a coping mechanism. In &quot;Make Room for Lisa&quot;, Hibbert tells Lisa that &quot;Before I learned to chuckle mindlessly, I was headed to an early grave.&quot; He reacts questionably to certain medical problems. For example, when Maggie saves Homer from drowning, Hibbert attributes it to common cases of superhuman strength in children whose parents&#x27; lives are in danger. Likewise, he expresses only mild surprise when both of Grandpa Simpson&#x27;s kidneys are revealed to have exploded. In &quot;Treehouse of Horror XX&quot;, Dr. Hibbert discusses the possibility of Bart being a &quot;genetic chosen one&quot; who can cure a zombie apocalypse over the phone with the Simpsons, while under siege from the aforementioned zombies.

There are hints throughout the series that Dr. Hibbert is not above dubious medical practices. After Marge talks him out of buying an unsuitable house, he suggests repaying her with black-market prescriptions. When he realizes that Marge is initially unenthusiastic about having a third child, he implies that a healthy baby could bring in as much as $60,000 on the black market. Hibbert covers for himself against Marge&#x27;s horrified reaction by saying that if she had replied any other way, she would be sent to prison, claiming that it is &quot;just a test&quot;. It is also suggested in the episode &quot;Wild Barts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot; that he does not in fact have a medical license.

Despite his seemingly honest and good-hearted personality, there is evidence that he is, at heart, a mercenary. In &quot;Homer&#x27;s Triple Bypass&quot;, Hibbert tells Homer that his open heart surgery will cost $30,000. When Homer has a heart attack in front of him in response to this news, he says, unmoved, that the cost is now $40,000 – hinting the heart attack made him now require a quadruple bypass. In &quot;Bye Bye Nerdie&quot;, after Homer&#x27;s baby-proofing business eliminates child injuries in Springfield, Hibbert complains that he is behind in his boat payments because of this. He is a Republican and attends Springfield&#x27;s Republican meetings alongside Mr Burns, Rainier Wolfcastle, and a Nosferatu-like creature. Hibbert also freely wears fur coats, believing that while fur itself may not be murder, &quot;paying for it sure is!&quot;

Hibbert is often seen in flashbacks (for example, Lisa&#x27;s birth, or Bart&#x27;s accidents as a toddler), and each time has a different hairstyle (afro, braids, Mr. T-style Mohawk, etc.) appropriate for the time period.

Dr. Hibbert is married; he and his wife Bernice have at least three children, two boys and a girl. When his entire family is seen together, they appear to be a spoof of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. Bernice is known to be something of a heavy drinker; this has been joked about on at least one occasion (in &quot;Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment&quot;, she faints upon reading the news that Prohibition has been introduced in Springfield) and laughs exactly like her husband. Despite apparent marriage problems, Dr. Hibbert still requests that the Simpsons tell Bernice that he loves her during a zombie apocalypse, though Homer misinterprets the message and resolves to just give her a high-five.

In the sixth season episode &#x27;Round Springfield&quot;, it is implied that he and Bleeding Gums Murphy are long-lost brothers; Hibbert says he has a long-lost brother who is a jazz musician and Murphy says he has a brother who is a doctor that chuckles at inappropriate times, but somehow the two do not put these clues together. However, Murphy later dies, so it will never be known for certain if they are brothers or not. Hibbert also bears a striking resemblance to the director of the Shelbyville orphanage, who mentions a personal quest to find his long-lost twin to an indifferent Homer. In the 1999 episode &quot;Grift of the Magi&quot;, we learn that Dr. Hibbert lives next door to Police Chief Wiggum.

In writers Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky&#x27;s original script for &quot;Bart the Daredevil&quot;, Hibbert was a woman, named &quot;Julia Hibbert&quot;, whom they named after comedic actress Julia Sweeney (Hibbert was her married last name at the time). When Fox moved &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to prime time on Thursdays against NBC&#x27;s top-rated &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, the writing staff decided to make Dr. Hibbert a parody of Bill Cosby&#x27;s character, Dr. Cliff Huxtable. Dr. Hibbert is usually shown wearing colorful sweaters when not on duty, a reference to Huxtable. Like the Cosby character, Dr. Hibbert laughs inappropriately, at pretty much everything. He is one of the few competent characters in the show, and was originally shown as being sympathetic to his patients&#x27; conditions, but that was eventually changed to him being less caring about his patients.

==Cultural reception==
A tongue-in-cheek analysis in the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; (&quot;CMAJ&quot;) compares the services of Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick Riviera, a quack physician often used by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as an alternative source of medical advice. While Hibbert is praised for his sense of humor and quality of care, it concludes that Nick is a better role model for physicians; Hibbert is a paternalistic and wasteful physician, unlike Nick, who strives to cut costs and does his best to avoid the coroner. This study was rebutted, also in &quot;CMAJ&quot;, casting both characters aside as a role model in favor of Dr. Bones McCoy of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;TV&#x27;s only true physician&quot; and &quot;someone who has broken free from the yoke of ethics and practises the art and science of medicine beyond the stultifying opposition of paternalism and autonomy. A free and independent thinker and, indeed, someone even beyond role models&quot;.

In mid-2020, amid the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd protests, the &quot;Simpsons&quot; producers declared their intentions to no longer use white actors to voice non-white characters; thus, Dr. Hibbert&#x27;s voice actor was recast. Harry Shearer, the original voice actor, second-guessed this decision, saying all actors are hired to &quot;play someone who they are not&quot;. This came amid similar recasting on other cartoons such as &quot;Family Guy&quot;. In February of the following year, it was announced that beginning with the episode &quot;Wad Goals&quot;, voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson, who is African-American, would replace Shearer as Hibbert.

<text>Chief Clancy Wiggum
is a fictional character from the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, voiced by Hank Azaria. He is the chief of police in the show&#x27;s setting of Springfield, and is the father of Ralph Wiggum and the husband of Sarah Wiggum.

Gluttonous, irresponsible, and immature, Wiggum is often too lazy, cowardly, and corrupt to bother fighting crime. His more responsible subordinate officers Eddie and Lou play the straight men to his shenanigans.

== Character development ==

His surname &quot;Wiggum&quot; is Matt Groening&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name. As &quot;a conscious pun&quot;, Wiggum was designed to look like a pig. Hank Azaria first based his voice for Wiggum on David Brinkley, but it was too slow and he switched it to an Edward G. Robinson impression.

== Biography ==
Many episodes have dealt with the back story of how Wiggum, despite his incompetence, occupies such a high rank in the Springfield Police Department; However, these jokes tend to contradict one another, as is the usual with side characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Wiggum was temporarily promoted to Commissioner of Police for the state in which Springfield resides during the 2005 episode &quot;Pranksta Rap&quot;. He also appeared on a Halloween novel depicting Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Stranger Things&quot; Chief Jim Hopper.

<text>Matlock is an American mystery legal drama television series created by Dean Hargrove and starring Andy Griffith in the title role of criminal defense attorney Ben Matlock. The show, produced by Intermedia Entertainment Company (first season only), The Fred Silverman Company, Dean Hargrove Productions (called Strathmore Productions in the first two seasons) and Viacom Productions, originally aired from March 3, 1986, to May 8, 1992, on NBC, then on ABC from November 5, 1992, to May 7, 1995.

The show&#x27;s format is similar to that of CBS&#x27; &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (both &quot;Matlock&quot; and the 1980s &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television films were created by Dean Hargrove), with Matlock identifying the perpetrators and then confronting them in dramatic courtroom scenes. One difference, however, was that whereas Mason usually exculpated his clients at a pretrial hearing, Matlock usually secured an acquittal at trial from the jury.

A gender flipping reboot, starring Kathy Bates, premiered on CBS on September 22, 2024.

==Premise==
The show is about widower Ben Matlock (Andy Griffith), a renowned, folksy and popular though cantankerous attorney. Usually, at the end of the case, the person who is on the stand being questioned by Matlock is the actual perpetrator and Matlock will expose them, despite making clear that his one goal is to prove reasonable doubt in the case of his client&#x27;s guilt or to prove his client&#x27;s innocence. Matlock studied law at Harvard Law School and, after several years as a public defender, established his law practice in Atlanta, living in a modest farmhouse in a neighboring suburb. He is known to visit crime scenes to discover clues otherwise overlooked and then come up with viable alternative theories of the crime in question (usually murder). Matlock also has conspicuously finicky fashion sense; he generally appears in court wearing a trademark light gray suit and, over the series&#x27; entire run, owned three generations of the Ford Crown Victoria—always an all-gray model (Griffith&#x27;s characters had always driven Ford products since his series, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;).

Matlock is noted for his thrift and a fondness for hot dogs. In &quot;The Diner&quot; (season eight, episode four), hot dogs are revealed to have been his favorite dish since he was a young man. In contrast, after the series ended, his penchant for hot dogs was explained in the &quot;&quot; two-part season four episode &quot;Murder Two&quot; (episodes 15–16). In that episode, Matlock blames Dr. Mark Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) for recommending a disastrous investment in 8-track tapes, in which he lost his savings of $5,000 in 1969 (), forcing him into wearing cheap suits and living on hot dogs.

Despite his thrift, Matlock&#x27;s standard fee is $100,000 (), usually paid up front, but if he or his staff believe strongly enough in the innocence of a client or if the client is unable to pay immediately (if at all), he has them pay over time or reduces the fee significantly or waives it entirely, albeit reluctantly in some cases. He also reluctantly takes a &quot;pro bono&quot; case occasionally. These traits, and the demands he placed upon his investigators, are often points of comic relief in the series.

==Changes==
The series premiered with Ben Matlock (played by Andy Griffith) having a law practice with his daughter, Charlene (played by Lori Lethin in the pilot movie; Linda Purl took over the role when the series went to air). Matlock also employed stock market whiz Tyler Hudson (Kene Holliday) as a private investigator. Tyler would often go undercover for Matlock in various guises to gather information. Matlock&#x27;s most frequent legal adversary was Julie March (Julie Sommars), a Nebraska native. Although their jobs as prosecutor and defense attorney made them professional rivals, their relationship outside of court was very cordial and they often spent time together outside of court with occasional flirtations. Toward the end of the first season, Matlock took on cocky law student Cassie Phillips (played by Kari Lizer) as an office worker.

After the first season ended, Purl departed from the series and her character, Charlene, moved to Philadelphia to start her own law practice. To begin the second season, Matlock went to London to try a case where he met Michelle Thomas (played by Nancy Stafford), a young American lawyer. After the case was over, Michelle followed Matlock to the U.S. and became his new law partner. Cassie stayed on as a file clerk until the end of the season, when she disappeared for reasons never made clear. With Lizer&#x27;s departure, Julie Sommars became a regular cast member.
Several actors/actresses appeared in the series as different characters prior to becoming regular cast members. In season one&#x27;s &quot;The Seduction&quot;, Stafford played Caryn Nelson/Carole Nathan, a high-class prostitute who was paid off to commit perjury against Matlock&#x27;s client. In &quot;The Angel&quot;, Lizer appeared as Matlock&#x27;s client, Margaret Danello, a pop star called &quot;Angel&quot;. Roebuck played a young physician, Dr. Bobby Shaw, in &quot;The Doctors&quot;; lawyer Alex Winthrop in season three&#x27;s two-part episode, &quot;The Ambassador&quot;/&quot;The Priest&quot;; and a prosecutor in a two-part episode, &quot;The Assassination&quot;, before becoming a cast regular in season seven.

Some actors/actresses appeared as a different character in each appearance on the show. For example, Carolyn Seymour played Christina Harrison Ward in season one (&quot;The Affair&quot;, episode 4), Dr. Vanessa Sedgwick in season two (&quot;The Genius&quot;, episode 20) and Iris Vogel in season three (&quot;The Psychic&quot;, episode 13). Nana Visitor and Roddy McDowall made several guest appearances as well. Holliday was fired after the third season for drug and alcohol abuse, but had a recurring role in season four (&quot;The Best Seller&quot;, episode 4 and &quot;The Witness&quot;, episode 14). Matlock hired Conrad McMasters (Clarence Gilyard Jr.), a young, former North Carolina deputy sheriff, to be his new detective. Like Tyler, Conrad would also go undercover to gather information about cases. However, the two characters were different in their personalities and approach to the job. Matlock and McMasters became good friends and were alike in many ways.

Don Knotts, who co-starred with Griffith on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, began making frequent appearances as Les &quot;Ace&quot; Calhoun, Matlock&#x27;s next-door neighbor. Before replacing Stafford at the start of season seven, Brynn Thayer appeared in two season six episodes (&quot;The Suspect&quot;, episodes 7–8) as Roxanne Windemere, a rich widow charged with murder with whom Ben became smitten. In the season finale (&quot;The Assassination&quot;, episodes 21–22) she appeared as Leanne MacIntyre, Ben&#x27;s previously unmentioned daughter who takes on the case of a murdered mayor. She joined the cast full-time in season seven. Daniel Roebuck joined Thayer as a new regular for season seven as Cliff Lewis, a naive young lawyer and associate. Warren Frost joined the cast in a recurring role as Billy Lewis, Cliff&#x27;s father and a personal nemesis from Matlock&#x27;s past: Ben had abandoned a romance with Billy&#x27;s sister to pursue his law degree. The move in 1992 to ABC for the remainder of the series caused some cast turnover. Stafford left the series to spend more time with her husband, Larry Myers. Sommars followed, although she would play a recurring role in several later episodes. Knotts followed. With Roebuck joining the cast, Gilyard&#x27;s role was diminished.

After season seven ended, Gilyard left the series to join the new CBS series &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, although he appeared once in season eight (&quot;The View&quot;, episode five). Like Silverman and Hargrove&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot; series revival, &quot;Matlock&quot; had largely become a series of movies-of-the-week by season nine. Part of the reason for this was Griffith&#x27;s advancing age; he was 66 and also wanted to spend more time with his family. At the end of season 8, Thayer departed from the series. In the first episode of season nine (&quot;The Accused&quot;) Ben tells Billy that Leanne moved to Los Angeles, seems to like her job, and &quot;has a fella.&quot; In the final season, Carol Huston joined the series as Jerri Stone, a private investigator helping Cliff in his duties. Like Conrad, Jerri and Ben had shared hobbies including singing. The move also saw a change in filming venue. Shooting in California for its entire run on NBC (which required Griffith to commute from his home in North Carolina to the West Coast), ABC moved production to the EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina to ease the travel burden on Griffith. The &quot;whodunit&quot; format was also adjusted to an &quot;inverted detective story&quot; format.

==Episodes==

&quot;Matlock&quot; aired a total of 193 episodes across nine seasons and began with a TV-movie. 12 two-hour and 15 two-part episodes of the program were aired. Six of the episodes were clip shows with mostly minor plots that paved the way for scenes from previous stories. Although Griffith appeared in more episodes portraying Sheriff Andy Taylor in &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; than Ben Matlock in &quot;Matlock&quot; (the former has 249 episodes, and the latter has 193), he logged more on-screen time as Ben Matlock than he did as Sheriff Andy Taylor due to the length of each show (&quot;Matlock&quot; ran for 45–48 minutes, while &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; ran for 25–26 minutes).

==Program format==
A few changes were made in the format of the introduction of the episodes. The introduction of characters was essentially the same, with the only changes being the actors for each season. Griffith, Purl, Holliday, Stafford, Gilyard Jr., Thayer, Sommars, Lizer, Roebuck and Huston were all featured in the intros for their respective seasons. The &quot;Matlock&quot; commercial screen also changed. The early episodes had a scene of Ben Matlock in front of a brown screen; around 1987, this was changed to gray. In 1992, this was changed once again to the same gray, but with a blue square around the &quot;M&quot; in &quot;Matlock.&quot; Later in the 1993–1994 season, the commercial screen was removed entirely. Nancy Stafford began appearing in a dual role in many opening credits from season three onwards, both as her main character Michelle Thomas, and the high-class call girl she played in the first season (seen on the witness stand, though her face is obscured).

===Spin-offs===
&quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot; was a spin-off on CBS based on a character who originated in &quot;The Don&quot; (1986), a two-part &quot;Matlock&quot; episode from season one. William Conrad played prosecutor James L. McShane and Joe Penny played Paul Baron, the son of Matlock&#x27;s client, Mafia don Nicholas Baron. Executive producers Fred Silverman and Dean Hargrove were responsible for both &quot;Matlock&quot; and &quot;Jake and the Fatman,&quot; as well as &quot;,&quot; created by Joyce Burditt (which itself was a spin-off of &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;) in 1993, also on CBS; &quot;Father Dowling Mysteries&quot; in 1988 on NBC and ABC; and the 30 &quot;Perry Mason&quot; made-for-TV movies from 1985 until 1995 on NBC.

==Home media==

===DVD releases===
CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released all nine seasons of &quot;Matlock&quot; on DVD in Region 1.
On April 7, 2015, CBS released &quot;Matlock: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.
===Streaming===
Season one of the series was made available for purchase through Amazon Video. The series is available on demand through Pluto TV, and as of January 15, 2025, all 9 seasons are made available to stream on Paramount+.

==2024 series==

In January 2023, CBS announced development of a new series starring Kathy Bates and Skye P. Marshall, with David Del Rio, Leah Lewis and Jason Ritter supporting and gave a pilot order in February. In May, it was announced that the show had been officially greenlit with a series order. In February 2024, it was announced that Beau Bridges also join the cast in the recurring role of Senior. The series was delayed to the 2024–25 television season amidst the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. The show is set to premiere on September 22, 2024, on CBS and streaming on Paramount+, then start airing in its regular timeslot (Thursday 9pm) on October 17, 2024.

In the new series, the original TV show exists as an in-universe TV series with Bates&#x27; Matlock using the same surname as the TV show character as an alias.

<text>Murphy is an Irish surname meaning &quot;Sea Warrior&quot;.

== Origins and variants ==
The surname is a variant of two Irish surnames: &quot;Ó Murchadha&quot;/&quot;Ó Murchadh&quot; (descendant of &quot;Murchadh&quot;), and &quot;Mac Murchaidh&quot;/&quot;Mac Murchadh&quot; (son of &quot;Murchadh&quot;) derived from the Irish personal name &quot;Murchadh&quot;, which meant sea-warrior or sea-battler (&quot;muir&quot; meaning sea and &quot;cath&quot; meaning battle).

According to historian C. Thomas Cairney, the O&#x27;Murphys were one of the chiefly families of the Uí Ceinnselaig who in turn were a tribe from the Dumnonii or Laigin who were the third wave of Celts to settle in Ireland during the first century BC. The O&#x27;Murphys as one of the chiefly families of the Uí Ceinnselaig is supported by John O&#x27;Hart in his 1892 &quot;Irish Pedigrees; or, The Origin and Stem of The Irish Nation&quot;.

Murchadh is reported to have been gripped with a boiling awful rage, an extreme elevation and greatness of spirit and intellect when he joined the middle of the action and prepared to assail the foreign invaders, the Danes, after they had repulsed the Dal gCais. A gallantry and championship bird rose inside him and fluttered above his head and on his breath.

In modern Irish, &quot;Ó Murchú&quot; or Mac Murchú rather than Mac/Ó Murchadha&quot;, is used.

&quot;Murphy&quot; is the most common surname in Ireland, the fourteenth most common surname in Northern Ireland, and the sixty-fourth most common surname in the United States.

<doc id="64906" wikidata="Q1504550" url="?curid=64906" title="Troy McClure">
<text>Troy McClure is a fictional character in the American animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He was originally voiced by Phil Hartman and first appeared in the second season episode &quot;Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment&quot;. McClure is a washed-up actor who is usually shown doing low-level work, most notably hosting manipulative infomercials and questionable educational films. He appears as the main character in &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;, in which he marries Selma Bouvier to aid his failing career and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also hosts &quot;The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase&quot;.

McClure was partially based on B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure, as well as Hartman himself. Following Hartman&#x27;s murder on May 28, 1998, two of his &quot;Simpsons&quot; characters were retired, with Hartman&#x27;s final speaking appearance as McClure occurring in the tenth season episode &quot;Bart the Mother&quot; four months after his murder. Since then, he has only occasionally cameoed in the background. Since his retirement, McClure has often been cited as one of the series&#x27; most popular characters. In 2006, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked McClure No. 1 on their list of the &quot;Top 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; Peripheral Characters&quot;.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Troy McClure is a stereotypical Hollywood has-been. He was a star in the early 1970s, but his career went downhill due to rumors of zoophilia involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos and infomercials. They are often low-quality, highly erroneous and too short and incomplete to be useful, and feature bizarre topics such as &quot;Dig Your Own Grave and Save&quot; and &quot;Smoke Yourself Thin&quot;. McClure introduces himself by saying, &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as...,&quot; mentioning two titles that are similar to his current performance. For example, in the episode &quot;Bart the Mother&quot;, McClure introduces a film about birds by saying, &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as &quot;Earwigs: Eww!&quot; and &quot;Man vs. Nature: The Road to Victory&quot;.&quot; When he auditions to voice the character Poochie in &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; (a role he would lose to Homer Simpson), he falls into his introductory style, mentioning his previous role as Christmas Ape.

McClure&#x27;s most prominent role occurs in the seventh-season episode &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;. In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with Selma Bouvier, whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles and agrees to go out on a date as a condition for passing him. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in &quot;Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!&quot;, a stage musical version of the film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. To further boost McClure&#x27;s career, McClure&#x27;s agent suggests that he get married. Unaware of McClure&#x27;s motivation, Selma accepts his proposal, and moves into McClure&#x27;s house, a Modernist building which resembles the Chemosphere. At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure tells Homer Simpson that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing at the wedding, but later offhandedly mentions McClure&#x27;s admission to Marge, who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but she becomes disturbed when McClure&#x27;s agent advises the pair to have a child (since &quot;all the big parts these days are going to family men&quot;). Having a child will secure McClure&#x27;s casting as McBain&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;McBain IV: Fatal Discharge&quot;, but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship and decides to leave McClure. McClure ultimately gets the role, but turns it down in order to direct and star in his own pet project, a 20th Century Fox film called &quot;The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel&quot;.

In addition to his in-story appearances, McClure appears as host of &quot;The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase&quot;. The first is a behind-the-scenes look at &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, answering questions and featuring extra &quot;never-before-seen&quot; material. The second is an episode presenting three possible spin-offs from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

===In other media===
McClure was made into an action figure as part of the &quot;World of Springfield&quot; toy line, and was released in the &quot;Celebrity Series 1&quot; wave in 2002. He also features briefly in the video game &quot;Virtual Springfield&quot;, introducing the town of Springfield to the player.

==Character==

===Creation===

McClure was based on the typical &quot;washed up&quot; Hollywood actor. B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects. Doug McClure found the homage funny and his children called him &quot;Troy McClure&quot; when his back was turned. According to show creator Matt Groening, Phil Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull &quot;the maximum amount of humor&quot; out of any line he was given. McClure&#x27;s visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. When he was designed, McClure was given an extra line under his eyes to suggest that the character had gotten a facelift.

In a very brief appearance in the season 2 episode &quot;Bart&#x27;s Dog Gets an &quot;F&quot;, Troy was voiced by Dan Castellaneta.

===Development===
According to executive producer Al Jean, the writers often used McClure as a &quot;panic button&quot; and added the character when they felt an episode needed more humor.

McClure&#x27;s character is most developed in &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;, which provides a more in-depth look into his private life and backstory. Showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give Hartman as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of McClure&#x27;s marriage to Selma Bouvier, as she was &quot;always marrying people&quot;. Animator Mark Kirkland was particularly pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting Hartman&#x27;s voice-over performances, and the episode allowed him and the other animators to &quot;open [McClure] up visually as a character&quot;.

Throughout &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;, it is hinted that McClure engages in strange sexual behavior. The writers did not initially know what the &quot;unsavory&quot; sexual preference would be, but eventually decided on a fish fetish, using a suggestion from executive producer James L. Brooks. Josh Weinstein described the fish fetish concept as &quot;so perverted and strange, it was over the top.&quot;

===Retirement===
Phil Hartman was murdered in 1998. Rather than re-casting the role with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure, along with Hartman&#x27;s other recurring character, Lionel Hutz. McClure last appeared in the season ten episode &quot;Bart the Mother&quot;, which was dedicated to Hartman. Before his death, Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a live-action film about McClure, which would be penned by some of the show&#x27;s writers. He noted that he was &quot;looking forward to his live-action movie, publicizing [McClure&#x27;s] Betty Ford appearances.&quot; Matt Groening later told &quot;Empire&quot; that the idea never &quot;got further than enthusiasm&quot;, but &quot;would have been really fun&quot;. Although retired from speaking roles, the character has still appeared in background roles in subsequent episodes, and is also featured on the Digital Purchase cover for season 30.

==Reception and cultural influence==
Even after his retirement, McClure remains a popular supporting character. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked McClure first in their 2006 list of the &quot;Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters&quot;, calling him &quot;a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can be.&quot; In a 2007 article on &quot;Simpsons&quot; guest stars, Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that McClure was &quot;responsible for some of the funniest moments in &quot;Simpsons&quot; history.&quot; Hartman ranked first on AOL&#x27;s list of their favorite 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; guest stars. Chris Turner argues in &quot;Planet Simpson&quot; that McClure and Lionel Hutz &quot;together ... represent the most significant contribution to the show outside of its permanent cast,&quot; adding that &quot;the show&#x27;s Golden Age is hard to imagine without them.&quot; He continues, &quot;The smarmy Hollywood type ... has been done to death, but Hartman&#x27;s version breathed new life into it with each appearance. McClure has become the apotheosis of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny reinterpretation whose trademark introduction ... has become a shorthand way to describe any grossly artificial media figure.&quot;

McClure&#x27;s most prominent episode, &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;, is a favorite of many staff members, and has been cited as one of the series&#x27; best episodes by several publications. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed the episode eighth on their top 25 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode list, and &quot;IGN&quot; named the episode the best of the seventh season, calling it the &quot;obvious pick&quot;. They also deemed McClure&#x27;s &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; musical the best moment of the episode and &quot;maybe even the whole show&quot;.

McClure was one of Hartman&#x27;s best-known roles. He often used his McClure voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;. He remarked, &quot;My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans.&quot; He added &quot;It&#x27;s the one thing that I do in my life that&#x27;s almost an avocation. I do it for the pure love of it.&quot; Many obituaries of Hartman mentioned his work as McClure as one of the highlights of his career. The BBC said that &quot;[Hartman&#x27;s] voice was known to millions&quot; because of McClure and Lionel Hutz.

The title of a song on American indie-rock band Yo La Tengo&#x27;s ninth full-length album, &quot;And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Save Tony Orlando&#x27;s House&quot;, is based upon a telethon that McClure hosts in the episode &quot;Marge on the Lam&quot;. In an interview with the A.V. Club, Ira Kaplan, the singer and guitarist of Yo La Tengo, states that James McNew, the band&#x27;s bassist, titled a series of instrumentals from the Troy McClure filmography.

<text>Brock Kentman, more commonly called Kent Brockman, is a fictional character in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is voiced by Harry Shearer and first appeared in the episode &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;. He is the grumpy, self-centered, pompous news anchor for the local Springfield news.

==Profile==

Kent Brockman hosts the Channel 6 weekday news, as well as &quot;Smartline&quot;, a local current-affairs program (a parody of the national current-affairs program &quot;Nightline&quot;), &quot;Bite Back! With Kent Brockman&quot; (a parody of &quot;Fight Back! With David Horowitz&quot;), &quot;Eye on Springfield&quot; (a parody of &quot;Eye on LA&quot;), which focuses mostly on Springfield&#x27;s entertainment news, the game show &quot;Springfield Squares&quot;, &quot;Springfield Action News,&quot; and has his own personal commentary segment of the 6:00 p.m. news, &quot;My Two Cents&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Mansion Family&quot;, he co-hosted an award show with pop music singer Britney Spears.

It has been hinted that Brockman is ethnically Jewish, having changed his surname from Brockelstein; this was first indicated in a 1960s flashback featured in the episode &quot;Mother Simpson&quot;, in which Brockman was known as Kenny Brockelstein early in his career. He can sometimes be spotted wearing the Hebrew Chai symbol on a necklace. However, he is seen several times attending Reverend Lovejoy&#x27;s Protestant church, and in &quot;Marge on the Lam&quot; he states his belief in the Book of Revelation, suggesting he professes Christian religious beliefs.

Brockman has a daughter, Brittany, who may have been the product of his fling with the Channel 6 weather girl. He also has a wife named Stephanie. In &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot;, Brockman is revealed to have during his career, reported on the Vietnam War, the 1979-89 Soviet–Afghan War, and the 1991 Gulf War.

In &quot;Dog of Death&quot;, Brockman won the multimillion-dollar ($130 million) state lottery jackpot and left the news desk while still on the air. However, he remained a news anchor because he was under contract, though he also admitted that he likes making $500,000 a year. He has an ongoing feud with traffic reporter Arnie Pye, and has been shown to criticize Pye&#x27;s reporting and also even chuckles when it was thought Pye had died in a helicopter accident. When Arnie Pye took Brockman&#x27;s anchor position he admitted on the air he made out with Brockman&#x27;s daughter but was sure to note it was with &quot;the grown up one,&quot; thus revealing Brockman has an adult daughter.

Brockman&#x27;s penchant for using offensive language worked against him in the 400th episode, &quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want,&quot; where, after Homer accidentally spilled coffee on Brockman&#x27;s crotch, he shouted what Ned Flanders called a &quot;super swear&quot; that shocked everyone who watches it. Brockman was demoted to weather man due to the station paying a fine to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and was soon fired when the network executives deliberately mistook a ring of Splenda in Brockman&#x27;s coffee for cocaine. Brockman was later given his job back to silence him (after doing an exposé that was seen on YouTube uncovering the real reason the FCC is cracking down on obscenity in the media), with a 50% raise, making his new salary $750,000 a year.

==Creation and inspirations==
Kent Brockman first appeared on television in the first season episode &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;, which originally aired April 29, 1990. The character was based on Los Angeles anchormen Hal Fishman and Jerry Dunphy. The director of &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;, Brad Bird, designed the character and modeled him after anchorman Ted Koppel. Another influence on the character was &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;&#x27;s Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight. Dunphy was proud of the fact that Brockman was based on him and would tell people that he was Kent Brockman.

==Cultural influence==
Brockman is responsible for popularizing the snowclone &quot;I, for one, welcome our new &quot;[fill-in-the-blank]&quot; overlords&quot;, sometimes used to express mock submission, usually for the purpose of humor. Brockman&#x27;s comment about believing a spacecraft was taken over by a master race of giant space ants in &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot; (1994), which generated the meme, is considered one of the show&#x27;s classic moments. The spacecraft was carrying an ant colony, though the insects were accidentally released by Homer. This led to an ant drifting by the video feed, appearing gigantic due to its proximity to the camera, at which point Brockman contemplates if the &quot;master race of giant space ants ... will consume the captive earth men or merely enslave them&quot; and eventually utters the line &quot;And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords&quot;. Author Chris Turner called it &quot;perhaps his finest hour as a journalist&quot; and said the scene is &quot;simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television.&quot;

Variations of the phrase have been used in the media, such as &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; and Ken Jennings on the &quot;Jeopardy! IBM Challenge&quot; (versus Watson) on February 16, 2011. On May 6, 2014, Stephen Colbert made direct reference to the phrase by using it as the closing line of his television program &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;.

==Reception==
The author of the book &quot;Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation&quot;, Chris Turner, said that &quot;if the institution of the News has a single iconic face on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, it&#x27;s Brockman&#x27;s&quot; and that &quot;in Brockman&#x27;s journalism, we see some of the modern news media&#x27;s ugliest biases&quot;, which he identifies as glibness, amplification, and sensationalism. MSN called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors.

&quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want&quot; was well received by critics. IGN called it the second best episode of the season.

==Merchandise==
Playmates Toys created a Kent Brockman action figure for its World of Springfield toy line which was released in July 2001.
