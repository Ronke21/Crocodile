<text>The Jesus Prayer, also known as The Prayer, is a short formulaic prayer, and is especially esteemed and advocated in Eastern Christianity and Catholicism. The prayer is as follows:

It is often repeated continually as a part of personal ascetic practice, its use being an integral part of the eremitic tradition of prayer known as hesychasm. The prayer is particularly esteemed by the spiritual fathers of this tradition (see &quot;Philokalia&quot;) as a method of cleaning and opening up the mind and after this the heart (), brought about first by the Prayer of the Mind, or more precisely the Noetic Prayer (), and after this the Prayer of the Heart (). The &quot;Prayer of the Heart&quot; is considered to be the &quot;Unceasing Prayer&quot; that the Apostle Paul advocates in the New Testament. Theophan the Recluse regarded the &quot;Jesus Prayer&quot; stronger than all other prayers by virtue of the power of the Holy Name of Jesus.

Though identified more closely with Eastern Christianity, the prayer is found in Western Christianity in the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;. It also is used in conjunction with the innovation of Anglican prayer beads (Rev. Lynn Bauman in the mid-1980s). The prayer has been widely taught and discussed throughout the history of the Eastern Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. The ancient and original form did not include the words &quot;a sinner&quot;, which were added later.
The Eastern Orthodox theology of the Jesus Prayer as enunciated in the 14th century by Gregory Palamas was generally rejected by Latin Church theologians until the 20th century. Pope John Paul II called Gregory Palamas a saint, a great writer, and an authority on theology. He also spoke with appreciation of hesychasm as &quot;that deep union of grace which Eastern theology likes to describe with the particularly powerful term &quot;theosis&quot;, &#x27;divinization, and likened the meditative quality of the Jesus Prayer to that of the Catholic rosary.

==Origins==
The prayer&#x27;s origin is the Egyptian desert, which was settled by the monastic Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers in the 5th century. It was found inscribed in the ruins of a cell from that period in the Egyptian desert.

A formula similar to the standard form of the Jesus Prayer is found in a letter attributed to John Chrysostom, who died in AD 407. This &quot;Letter to an Abbot&quot; speaks of &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy&quot; and &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us&quot; being used as ceaseless prayer.

What may be the earliest explicit reference to the Jesus Prayer in a form that is similar to that used today is in &quot;Discourse on Abba Philimon&quot; from the . Philimon lived around AD 600. The version cited by Philimon is &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me&quot;, which is apparently the earliest source to cite this standard version. While the prayer itself was in use by that time, John S. Romanides writes that &quot;We are still searching the Fathers for the term &#x27;Jesus prayer&#x27;.&quot;

A similar idea is recommended in the &quot;Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot; of John Climacus (circa 523–606), who recommends the regular practice of a , or one-worded &quot;Jesus Prayer&quot;. The use of the Jesus Prayer according to the tradition of the is the subject of the 19th century anonymous Russian spiritual classic &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot;, also in the original form, without the addition of the words &quot;a sinner&quot;.

==Eastern Orthodoxy==

The hesychastic practice of the Jesus Prayer is founded on the biblical view by which God&#x27;s name is conceived as the place of his presence. Orthodox mysticism has no images or representations. The mystical practice (the prayer and the meditation) doesn&#x27;t lead to perceiving representations of God (see below Palamism). Thus, the most important means of a life consecrated to praying is the invoked &quot;name of God&quot;, as it is emphasized since the 5th century by the Thebaid anchorites, or by the later Athonite hesychasts. For the Orthodox the power of the Jesus Prayer comes not only from its content, but from the very invocation of Jesus&#x27; name.

===Scriptural roots===
The Jesus Prayer combines three Bible verses: the Christological hymn of the Pauline epistle Philippians (verse 11: &quot;Jesus Christ is Lord&quot;), the Annunciation of Luke (verse 35: &quot;Son of God&quot;), and the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican of Luke , in which the Pharisee demonstrates the improper way to pray (verse 11: &quot;God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican&quot;), whereas the Publican prays correctly in humility (verse 13: &quot;God be merciful to me a sinner&quot;).

===Palamism, the underlying theology===
Apophatism (negative theology) is the main characteristic of the Eastern theological tradition. is not conceived as agnosticism or refusal to know God, because the Eastern theology is not concerned with abstract concepts; it is contemplative, with a discourse on things above rational understanding. Therefore, dogmas are often expressed antinomically. This form of contemplation is experience of God, illumination, called the vision of God or, in Greek, theoria.

For the Eastern Orthodox the knowledge or of the uncreated energies is usually linked to apophatism.

===Repentance in Eastern Orthodoxy===

The Eastern Orthodox Church holds a non-juridical view of sin, by contrast to the satisfaction view of atonement for sin as articulated in the West, firstly by Anselm of Canterbury (as debt of honor)) and Thomas Aquinas (as a moral debt). The terms used in the East are less legalistic (&quot;grace&quot;, &quot;punishment&quot;), and more medical (&quot;sickness&quot;, &quot;healing&quot;) with less exacting precision. Sin, therefore, does not carry with it the guilt for breaking a rule, but rather the impetus to become something more than what men usually are. One repents not because one is or is not virtuous, but because human nature can change. Repentance (, &quot;metanoia&quot;, &quot;changing one&#x27;s mind&quot;) is not remorse, justification, or punishment, but a continual enactment of one&#x27;s freedom, deriving from renewed choice and leading to restoration (the return to man&#x27;s original state). This is reflected in the Mystery of Confession for which, not being limited to a mere confession of sins and presupposing recommendations or penalties, it is primarily that the priest acts in his capacity of spiritual father. The Mystery of Confession is linked to the spiritual development of the individual, and relates to the practice of choosing an elder to trust as his or her spiritual guide, turning to him for advice on the personal spiritual development, confessing sins, and asking advice.

As stated at the local Council of Constantinople in 1157, Christ brought his redemptive sacrifice not to the Father alone, but to the Trinity as a whole. In the Eastern Orthodox theology redemption is not seen as &quot;ransom&quot;. It is the &quot;reconciliation&quot; of God with man, the manifestation of God&#x27;s love for humanity. Thus, it is not the anger of God the Father but His love that lies behind the sacrificial death of his son on the cross.

The redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through theosis. The initiative belongs to God, but presupposes man&#x27;s active acceptance (not an action only, but an attitude), which is a way of perpetually receiving God.

===Distinctiveness from analogues in other religions===
The practice of contemplative or meditative chanting is known in several religions including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam (e.g. japa, zikr). The form of internal contemplation involving profound inner transformations affecting all the levels of the self is common to the traditions that posit the ontological value of personhood.

Although some aspects of the Jesus Prayer may resemble some aspects of other traditions, its Christian character is central rather than mere &quot;local color&quot;. The aim of the Christian practicing it is not limited to attaining humility, love, or purification of sinful thoughts, but rather it is becoming holy and seeking union with God (&quot;theosis&quot;), which subsumes all the aforementioned virtues. Thus, for the Eastern Orthodox:

:* The Jesus Prayer is, first of all, a prayer addressed to God. It is not a means of self-deifying or self-deliverance, but a counterexample to Adam&#x27;s pride, repairing the breach it produced between man and God.
:* The aim is not to be dissolved or absorbed into nothingness or into God, or reach another state of mind, but to (re)unite with God (which by itself is a process) while remaining a distinct person.
:* It is an invocation of Jesus&#x27; name, because Christian anthropology and soteriology are strongly linked to Christology in Orthodox monasticism.
:* In a modern context the continuing repetition is regarded by some as a form of meditation, the prayer functioning as a kind of mantra. However, Orthodox users of the Jesus Prayer emphasize the &quot;invocation&quot; of the name of Jesus Christ that Hesychios describes in &quot;Pros Theodoulon&quot; which would be contemplation on the Triune God rather than simply emptying the mind.
:* Acknowledging &quot;a sinner&quot; is to lead firstly to a state of humbleness and repentance, recognizing one&#x27;s own sinfulness.
:* Practicing the Jesus Prayer is strongly linked to mastering passions of both soul and body, e.g. by fasting. For the Eastern Orthodox it is not the body that is wicked, but &quot;the bodily way of thinking&quot;; therefore salvation also regards the body.
:* Unlike &quot;seed syllables&quot; in particular traditions of chanting mantras, the Jesus Prayer may be translated into whatever language the pray-er customarily uses. The emphasis is on the meaning, not on the mere utterance of certain sounds.
:* There is no emphasis on the psychosomatic techniques, which are merely seen as helpers for uniting the mind with the heart, not as prerequisites.

A magistral way of meeting God for the Orthodox, the Jesus Prayer does not harbor any secrets in itself, nor does its practice reveal any esoteric truths. Instead, as a hesychastic practice, it demands setting the mind apart from rational activities and ignoring the physical senses for the experiential knowledge of God. It stands along with the regular expected actions of the believer (prayer, almsgiving, repentance, fasting etc.) as the response of the Orthodox Tradition to Paul the Apostle&#x27;s challenge to &quot;pray without ceasing&quot; ().

==Practice==

===Techniques===
There are no fixed rules for those who pray, &quot;the way there is no mechanical, physical or mental technique which can force God to show his presence&quot; (Metropolitan Kallistos Ware).

In &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot;, the pilgrim advises, &quot;as you draw your breath in, say, or imagine yourself saying, &#x27;Lord Jesus Christ,&#x27; and as you breathe again, &#x27;have mercy on me.

The Jesus Prayer can be used for a kind of &quot;psychological&quot; self-analysis. According to the &quot;Way of the Pilgrim&quot; account and Mount Athos practitioners of the Jesus Prayer, &quot;one can have some insight on his or her current psychological situation by observing the intonation of the words of the prayer, as they are recited. Which word is stressed most. This self-analysis could reveal to the praying person things about their inner state and feelings, maybe not yet realised, of their unconsciousness.&quot;

Also, a person might want to consciously stress one of the words of the prayer in particular when one wants to express a conscious feeling of situation. So in times of need stressing the &#x27;have mercy&#x27; part can be more comforting or more appropriate. In times of failures, the &#x27;a sinner&#x27; part, etc.

===Levels of the prayer===

Paul Evdokimov, a 20th-century Russian philosopher and theologian, writes about beginner&#x27;s way of praying: initially, the prayer is excited because the man is emotive and a flow of psychic contents is expressed. In his view this condition comes, for the modern men, from the separation of the mind from the heart: &quot;The prattle spreads the soul, while the silence is drawing it together.&quot; Old fathers condemned elaborate phraseologies, for one word was enough for the publican, and one word saved the thief on the cross. They only uttered Jesus&#x27; name by which they were contemplating God. For Evdokimov the acting faith denies any formalism which quickly installs in the external prayer or in the life duties; he quotes Seraphim of Sarov: &quot;The prayer is not thorough if the man is self-conscious and he is aware he&#x27;s praying.&quot;

&quot;Because prayer is a living reality, a deeply personal encounter with the living God, it is not to be confined to any given classification or rigid analysis&quot;, says the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. As general guidelines for the practitioner, different number of levels (3, 7 or 9) in the practice of the prayer are distinguished by Orthodox fathers. They are to be seen as being purely informative, because the practice of the Prayer of the Heart is learned under personal spiritual guidance in Eastern Orthodoxy which emphasizes the perils of temptations when it is done on one&#x27;s own. Thus, Theophan the Recluse, a 19th-century Russian spiritual writer, talks about three stages:
# The oral prayer (the prayer of the lips) is a simple recitation, still external to the practitioner.
# The focused prayer, when &quot;the mind is focused upon the words&quot; of the prayer, &quot;speaking them as if they were our own&quot;.
# The prayer of the heart itself, when the prayer is no longer something we do but who we are.

Once this is achieved the Jesus Prayer is said to become &quot;self-active&quot; (). It is repeated automatically and unconsciously by the mind, becoming an internal habit like a (beneficial) earworm. Body, through the uttering of the prayer, mind, through the mental repetition of the prayer, are thus unified with &quot;the heart&quot; (spirit) and the prayer becomes constant, ceaselessly &quot;playing&quot; in the background of the mind, like a background music, without hindering the normal everyday activities of the person.

Others, like Father Archimandrite Ilie Cleopa, one of the most representative spiritual fathers of contemporary Romanian Orthodox monastic spirituality, talk about nine levels. They are the same path to theosis, more slenderly differentiated:
# The prayer of the lips.
# The prayer of the mouth.
# The prayer of the tongue.
# The prayer of the voice.
# The prayer of the mind.
# The prayer of the heart.
# The active prayer.
# The all-seeing prayer.
# The contemplative prayer.

==Variants of repetitive formulas==
A number of different repetitive prayer formulas have been attested in the history of Eastern Orthodox monasticism: the Prayer of St. Ioannikios the Great (754–846): &quot;My hope is the Father, my refuge is the Son, my shelter is the Holy Spirit, O Holy Trinity, Glory unto You&quot;, the repetitive use of which is described in his &quot;Life&quot;; or the more recent practice of Nikolaj Velimirović.

Similarly to the flexibility of the practice of the Jesus Prayer, there is no imposed standardization of its form. The prayer can be from as short as &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot; (Kyrie eleison), &quot;Have mercy on me&quot; (&quot;Have mercy upon us&quot;), or even &quot;Jesus&quot;, to its longer most common form. It can also contain a call to the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), or to the saints. The single essential and invariable element is Jesus&#x27; name.

* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. (a very common form)
* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me. (a very common form in the Greek tradition)
* Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me. (common variant on Mount Athos)
* Jesus, have mercy.
* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us.
* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me, a sinner.

==Catholic Church==
The Jesus Prayer is widely practiced among the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches.

Part four of the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, which is dedicated to Christian prayer, devotes paragraphs 2665 to 2669 to prayer to Jesus.

Similar methods of prayer in use in the Catholic Church are recitation, as recommended by John Cassian, of &quot;O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me&quot; or other verses of Scripture; repetition of a single monosyllabic word, as suggested by the Cloud of Unknowing; the method used in Centering Prayer; the method used by The World Community for Christian Meditation, based on the Aramaic invocation &quot;Maranatha&quot;; the use of Lectio Divina; etc.

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; says:

<text>A conglomerate () is a type of multi-industry company that consists of several different and unrelated business entities that operate in various industries. A conglomerate usually has a parent company that owns and controls many subsidiaries, which are legally independent but financially and strategically dependent on the parent company. Conglomerates are often large and multinational corporations that have a global presence and a diversified portfolio of products and services. Conglomerates can be formed by merger and acquisitions, spin-offs, or joint ventures.

Conglomerates are common in many countries and sectors, such as media, banking, energy, mining, manufacturing, retail, defense, and transportation. This type of organization aims to achieve economies of scale, market power, risk diversification, and financial synergy. However, they also face challenges such as complexity, bureaucracy, agency problems, and regulation.

The popularity of conglomerates has varied over time and across regions. In the United States, conglomerates became popular in the 1960s as a form of economic bubble driven by low interest rates and leveraged buyouts. However, many of them collapsed or were broken up in the 1980s due to poor performance, accounting scandals, and antitrust regulation. In contrast, conglomerates have remained prevalent in Asia, especially in China, Japan, South Korea, and India. In mainland China, many state-affiliated enterprises have gone through high value mergers and acquisitions, resulting in some of the highest value business transactions of all time. These conglomerates have strong ties with the government and preferential policies and access to capital.

==United States==
===The conglomerate fad of the 1960s===
During the 1960s, the United States was caught up in a &quot;conglomerate fad&quot; which turned out to be a form of an economic bubble.

Due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bear-bull market, conglomerates were able to buy smaller companies in leveraged buyouts (sometimes at temporarily deflated values). Famous examples from the 1960s include Gulf and Western Industries, Ling-Temco-Vought, ITT Corporation, Litton Industries, Textron, and Teledyne. The trick was to look for acquisition targets with solid earnings and much lower price–earnings ratios than the acquirer. The conglomerate would make a tender offer to the target&#x27;s shareholders at a princely premium to the target&#x27;s current stock price. Upon obtaining shareholder approval, the conglomerate usually settled the transaction in something other than cash, like debentures, bonds, warrants or convertible debentures (issuing the latter two would effectively dilute its shareholders down the road, but many shareholders at the time were not thinking that far ahead). The conglomerate would then add the target&#x27;s earnings to its earnings, thereby increasing the conglomerate&#x27;s overall earnings per share. In finance jargon, the transaction was &quot;accretive to earnings.&quot; 

The relatively lax accounting standards of the time meant that accountants were often able to get away with creative mathematics in calculating the conglomerate&#x27;s post-acquisition consolidated earnings numbers. In turn, the price of the conglomerate&#x27;s stock would go up, thereby re-establishing its previous price-earnings ratio, and then it could repeat the whole process with a new target. In plain English, conglomerates were using rapid acquisitions to create the illusion of rapid growth. In 1968, the peak year of the conglomerate fad, U.S. corporations completed a record number of mergers: approximately 4,500. In that year, at least 26 of the country&#x27;s 500 largest corporations were acquired, of which 12 had assets above $250 million.

All this complex company reorganization had very real consequences for people who worked for companies that were either acquired by conglomerates or were seen as likely to be acquired by them. Acquisitions were a disorienting and demoralizing experience for executives at acquired companies—those who were not immediately laid off found themselves at the mercy of the conglomerate&#x27;s executives in some other distant city. Most conglomerates&#x27; headquarters were located on the West Coast or East Coast, while many of their acquisitions were located in the country&#x27;s interior. Many interior cities were devastated by repeatedly losing the headquarters of corporations to mergers, in which independent ventures were reduced to subsidiaries of conglomerates based in New York or Los Angeles. Pittsburgh, for example, lost about a dozen. The terror instilled by the mere prospect of such harsh consequences for executives and their home cities meant that fending off takeovers, real or imagined, was a constant distraction for executives at all corporations seen as choice acquisition targets during this era.

The chain reaction of rapid growth through acquisitions could not last forever. When interest rates rose to offset rising inflation, conglomerate profits began to fall. The beginning of the end came in January 1968, when Litton shocked Wall Street by announcing a quarterly profit of only 21 cents per share, versus 63 cents for the previous year&#x27;s quarter. This was &quot;just a decline in earnings of about 19 percent&quot;, not an actual loss or a corporate scandal, and &quot;yet the stock was crushed, plummeting from $90 to $53&quot;. It would take two more years before it was clear that the conglomerate fad was on its way out. The stock market eventually figured out that the conglomerates&#x27; bloated and inefficient businesses were as cyclical as any others—indeed, it was that cyclical nature that had caused such businesses to be such undervalued acquisition targets in the first place—and their descent put &quot;the lie to the claim that diversification allowed them to ride out a downturn.&quot; A major selloff of conglomerate shares ensued. To keep going, many conglomerates were forced to shed the new businesses they had recently purchased, and by the mid-1970s most conglomerates had been reduced to shells. The conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a company&#x27;s core competency and unlocking shareholder value (which often translate into spin-offs).

===Genuine diversification===
In other cases, conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment. Companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks. Flush with cash during the 1980s, General Electric also moved into financing and financial services, which in 2005 accounted for about 45% of the company&#x27;s net earnings. GE formerly owned a minority interest in NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC television network and several other cable networks. United Technologies was also a successful conglomerate until it was dismantled in the late 2010s.

===Mutual funds===
With the spread of mutual funds (especially index funds since 1976), investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate. Another example of a successful conglomerate is Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in businesses across a variety of industries.

==International==
The end of the First World War caused a brief economic crisis in Weimar Germany, permitting entrepreneurs to buy businesses at rock-bottom prices. The most successful, Hugo Stinnes, established the most powerful private economic conglomerate in 1920s Europe – Stinnes Enterprises – which embraced sectors as diverse as manufacturing, mining, shipbuilding, hotels, newspapers, and other enterprises.

The best-known British conglomerate was Hanson plc. It followed a rather different timescale than the U.S. examples mentioned above, as it was founded in 1964 and ceased to be a conglomerate when it split itself into four separate listed companies between 1995 and 1997.

In Hong Kong, some of the well-known conglomerates include Jardine Matheson (AD1824), Swire Group (AD1816), (British companies, one Scottish one English; companies that have a history of over 150 years and have business interests that span across four continents with a focus in Asia.) C K Hutchison Whampoa (now CK Hutchison Holdings), Sino Group, (both Asian-owned companies specialize business such as real estate and hospitality with a focus in Asia.)

* Swire Group (AD1816) (or Swire Pacific) Started by Liverpool natives the Swire family, which controls a wide range of businesses, including property (Swire Properties), aviation (i.e. Cathay Pacific), beverages (bottler of Coca-Cola), shipping and trading.
* Jardine Matheson (AD1824) operates businesses in the fields of property (Hongkong Land), finance (Jardine Lloyd Thompson), trading, retail (Dairy Farm) and hotels (i.e. Mandarin Oriental).
*CK Hutchison Holdings Limited: Telecoms, Infrastructure, Ports, Health and Beauty Retail. Energy, Finance
* Sino Group

In Japan, a different model of conglomerate, the &quot;keiretsu&quot;, evolved. Whereas the Western model of conglomerate consists of a single corporation with multiple subsidiaries controlled by that corporation, the companies in a keiretsu are linked by interlocking shareholdings and a central role of a bank. Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo are some of Japan&#x27;s best-known keiretsu, reaching from automobile manufacturing to the production of electronics such as televisions. While not a keiretsu, Sony is an example of a modern Japanese conglomerate with operations in consumer electronics, video games, the music industry, television and film production and distribution, financial services, and telecommunications.

In China, many of the country&#x27;s conglomerates are state-owned enterprises, but there is a substantial number of private conglomerates. Notable conglomerates include BYD, CIMC, China Merchants Bank, Huawei, JXD, Meizu, Ping An Insurance, TCL, Tencent, TP-Link, ZTE, Legend Holdings, Dalian Wanda Group, China Poly Group, Beijing Enterprises, and Fosun International. Fosun is currently China&#x27;s largest civilian-run conglomerate by revenue.

In South Korea, the &quot;chaebol&quot; is a type of conglomerate owned and operated by a family. A chaebol is also inheritable, as most of the current presidents of chaebols succeeded their fathers or grandfathers. Some of the largest and most well-known Korean chaebols are Samsung, LG, Hyundai Kia and SK.

In India, family-owned enterprises became some of Asia&#x27;s largest conglomerates, such as the Aditya Birla Group, Tata Group, Emami, Kirloskar Group, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Mahindra Group, Bajaj Group, ITC Limited, Essar Group, Reliance Industries, Adani Group and the Bharti Enterprises.
In Brazil the largest conglomerates are J&amp;F Investimentos, Odebrecht, Itaúsa, Camargo Corrêa, Votorantim Group, Andrade Gutierrez, and Queiroz Galvão.

In Turkey the largest conglomerates are Koç Holding, Sabancı Holding, Yıldız Holding, Çukurova Holding, Doğuş Holding, Doğan Holding.

In New Zealand, Fletcher Challenge was formed in 1981 from the merger of Fletcher Holdings, Challenge Corporation, and Tasman Pulp &amp; Paper, in an attempt to create a New Zealand-based multi-national company. At the time, the newly merged company dealt in construction, building supplies, pulp and paper mills, forestry, and oil &amp; gas. Following a series of bungled investments, the company demerged in the early 2000s to concentrate on building and construction.

In Pakistan, some of the examples are Adamjee Group, Dawood Hercules, House of Habib, Lakson Group and Nishat Group.

In the Philippines, the largest conglomerate of the country is the Ayala Corporation which focuses on malls, bank, real estate development, and telecommunications. The other big conglomerates in the Philippines included JG Summit Holdings, Lopez Holdings Corporation, ABS-CBN Corporation, GMA Network, Inc., MediaQuest Holdings, TV5 Network, Inc.,
SM Investments Corporation, Metro Pacific Investments Corporation, and San Miguel Corporation.

In the United States, some of the examples are The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery and The Trump Organization (see below).

In Canada, one of the examples is Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Another such conglomerate is J.D. Irving, Limited, which controls a large portion of the economic activities as well as media in the Province of New Brunswick.

==Advantages and disadvantages of conglomerates==
===Advantages===
*Diversification results in a reduction of investment risk. A downturn suffered by one subsidiary, for instance, can be counterbalanced by stability, or even expansion, in another division. For example, if Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s construction materials business has a good year, the profit might be offset by a bad year in its insurance business. This advantage is enhanced by the fact that the business cycle affects industries in different ways. 
*A conglomerate creates an internal capital market if the external one is not developed enough. Through the internal market, different parts of the conglomerate allocate capital more effectively.
*A conglomerate can show earnings growth, by acquiring companies whose shares are more discounted than its own. In fact, Teledyne, GE, and Berkshire Hathaway have delivered high earnings growth for a time.

===Disadvantages===
* The extra layers of management increase costs.
* Accounting disclosure is less useful information, many numbers are disclosed grouped, rather than separately for each business. The complexity of a conglomerate&#x27;s accounts makes it harder for managers, investors, and regulators to analyze and makes it easier for management to hide issues.
* Conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks. The whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts.
* Culture clashes can destroy value.
* Inertia prevents the development of innovation.
* Lack of focus, and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well.
* Brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price, or cachet.
* Conglomerates more easily run the risk of being too big to fail.

Some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock (a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount) as evidential of these disadvantages, while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency, which undervalues the true strength of these stocks.

==Media conglomerates==
 
In her 1999 book &quot;No Logo&quot;, Naomi Klein provides several examples of mergers and acquisitions between media companies designed to create conglomerates to create synergy between them:
*WarnerMedia included several tenuously linked businesses during the 1990s and 2000s, including Internet access, content, film, cable systems, and television. Their diverse portfolio of assets allowed for cross-promotion and economies of scale. However, the company has sold or spun off many of these businesses – including Warner Music Group, Warner Books, AOL, Time Warner Cable, and Time Inc. – since 2004.
*Clear Channel Communications, a public company, at one point owned a variety of TV and radio stations and billboard operations, together with many concert venues across the US and a diverse portfolio of assets in the UK and other countries around the world. The concentration of bargaining power in this one entity allowed it to gain better deals for all of its business units. For example, the promise of playlisting (allegedly, sometimes, coupled with the threat of blacklisting) on its radio stations was used to secure better deals from artists performing in events organized by the entertainment division. These policies have been attacked as unfair and even monopolistic, but are a clear advantage of the conglomerate strategy. On December 21, 2005, Clear Channel completed the divestiture of Live Nation, and in 2007 the company divested their television stations to other firms, some of which Clear Channel holds a small interest in. Live Nation owns the events and concert venues previously owned by Clear Channel Communications.
* Impact of conglomerates on the media: The four major media conglomerates in the United States are The Walt Disney Company, Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global. The Walt Disney Company is linked with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), creating the largest media corporation, with revenue equal to roughly thirty six billion dollars. Since Walt Disney owns ABC, it controls its news and programming. Walt Disney also acquired most of Fox, for over $70 billion. When General Electric owned NBC, it did not allow negative reporting against General Electric on air (NBCUniversal is now owned by Comcast). Viacom merged with CBS in 2019 as ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) after originally merged in 2000 with Viacom as the surviving company while also Viacom divested CBS in 2006 due to FCC regulations as the time.

===Internet conglomerates===
A relatively new development, Internet conglomerates, such as Alphabet, Google&#x27;s parent company belong to the modern media conglomerate group and play a major role within various industries, such as brand management. In most cases, Internet conglomerates consist of corporations that own several medium-sized online or hybrid online-offline projects. In many cases, newly joined corporations get higher returns on investment, access to business contacts, and better rates on loans from various banks. 

==Food conglomerates==
Similar to other industries, many food companies can be termed as conglomerates.
* The Philip Morris group, which once was the parent company of Altria group, Philip Morris International, and Kraft Foods, had an annual combined turnover of $80 bn. Phillip Morris International and Kraft Foods later spun off into independent companies.
*Nestlé

<text>The House of Commons of Canada () is the lower house of the Parliament of Canada. Together with the Crown and the Senate of Canada, they comprise the bicameral legislature of Canada.

The House of Commons is a democratically elected body whose members are known as members of Parliament (MPs). There have been up to 338 MPs since the most recent electoral district redistribution for the 2015 federal election, which saw the addition of 30 seats. Members are elected by simple plurality (&quot;first-past-the-post&quot; system) in each of the country&#x27;s electoral districts, which are colloquially known as &quot;ridings&quot;. MPs may hold office until Parliament is dissolved and serve for constitutionally limited terms of up to five years after an election. Historically, however, terms have ended before their expiry and the sitting government has typically dissolved parliament within four years of an election according to a long-standing convention. In any case, an act of Parliament now limits each term to four years. Seats in the House of Commons are distributed roughly in proportion to the population of each province and territory. However, some ridings are more populous than others, and the Canadian constitution contains provisions regarding provincial representation. As a result, there is some interprovincial and regional malapportionment relative to the population.

The British North America Act 1867 (now called the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;) created the House of Commons, modelling it on the British House of Commons. The lower of the two houses making up the parliament, the House of Commons, in practice holds far more power than the upper house, the Senate. Although the approval of both chambers is necessary for legislation to become law, the Senate only occasionally amends bills passed by the House of Commons and rarely rejects them. Moreover, the Cabinet is responsible primarily to the House of Commons. The government stays in office only so long as they retain the support, or &quot;confidence&quot;, of the lower house.

The House of Commons meets in a temporary chamber in the West Block of the parliament buildings on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, while the Centre Block, which houses the traditional Commons chamber, undergoes renovation.

== Etymology ==

The term derives from the Anglo-Norman word &quot;communes,&quot; referring to the geographic and collective &quot;communities&quot; of their parliamentary representatives and not the third estate, the commonality. This distinction is made clear in the official French name of the body, &#x27;. Canada and the United Kingdom remain the only countries to use the name &quot;House of Commons&quot; for a lower house of parliament. The body&#x27;s formal name is: The Honourable the Commons of Canada in Parliament assembled ()

== History ==
The House of Commons came into existence in 1867, when the British Parliament passed the British North America Act 1867, uniting the Province of Canada (which was divided into Quebec and Ontario), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a single federation called Canada. The new Parliament of Canada consisted of the monarch (represented by the governor general, who also represented the Colonial Office), the Senate and the House of Commons. The Parliament of Canada was based on the Westminster model (that is, the model of the Parliament of the United Kingdom). Unlike the UK Parliament, the powers of the Parliament of Canada were limited in that other powers were assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures. The Parliament of Canada also remained subordinate to the British Parliament, the supreme legislative authority for the entire British Empire. Greater autonomy was granted by the Statute of Westminster 1931, after which new acts of the British Parliament did not apply to Canada, with some exceptions. These exceptions were removed by the Canada Act 1982.

From 1867, the Commons met in the chamber previously used by the Legislative Assembly of Canada until the building was destroyed by fire in 1916. It relocated to the amphitheatre of the Victoria Memorial Museum — what is today the Canadian Museum of Nature, where it met until 1922. Until the end of 2018, the Commons sat in the Centre Block chamber. Starting with the final sitting before the 2019 federal election, the Commons sits in a temporary chamber in the West Block until at least 2028, while renovations are undertaken in the Centre Block of Parliament.

;Notes
=== Ceremonial and Constitutional officers ===
Following an election the House of Commons elects a presiding officer, known as the speaker, at the beginning of each new parliamentary term, and also whenever a vacancy arises. Formerly, the prime minister determined who would serve as speaker. Although the House voted on the matter, the voting constituted a mere formality. Since 1986, however, the House has elected speakers by secret ballot. The speaker is assisted by a deputy speaker, who also holds the title of chair of Committees of the Whole. Two other deputies—the deputy chair of Committees of the Whole and the assistant deputy chair of Committees of the Whole—also preside. The duties of presiding over the House are divided between the four officers aforementioned; however, the speaker usually presides over Question Period and over the most important debates.

Officers of the House who are not members include the clerk of the House of Commons, the deputy clerk, the law clerk and parliamentary counsel, and several other clerks. These officers advise the speaker and members on the rules and procedure of the House in addition to exercising senior management functions within the House administration. Another important officer is the sergeant-at-arms, whose duties include the maintenance of order and security on the House&#x27;s premises and inside the buildings of the parliamentary precinct. (The Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrol Parliament Hill but are not allowed into the buildings unless asked by the speaker). The sergeant-at-arms also carries the ceremonial mace, a symbol of the authority of the Crown and the House of Commons, into the House each sitting. The House is also staffed by parliamentary pages, who carry messages to the members in the chamber and otherwise provide assistance to the House.

The term &quot;member of Parliament&quot; is usually just used only to refer to elected members of the House of Commons, even though the Senate is also a part of Parliament. Members of the House of Commons may use the post-nominal letters &quot;MP&quot;. The annual salary of each MP, was $203,100; members may receive additional salaries in right of other offices they hold (for instance, the speakership). MPs rank immediately below senators in the order of precedence.

=== Committees ===

The Parliament of Canada uses committees for a variety of purposes. Committees consider bills in detail and may make amendments. Other committees scrutinize various Government agencies and ministries.

Potentially, the largest of the Commons committees are the Committees of the Whole, which, as the name suggests, consist of all the members of the House. A Committee of the Whole meets in the Chamber of the House but proceeds under slightly modified rules of debate. (For example, a member may make more than one speech on a motion in a Committee of the Whole, but not during a normal session of the House.) Instead of the speaker, the chair, deputy chair, or assistant deputy chair presides. The House resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole to discuss appropriation bills, and sometimes for other legislation.

The House of Commons also has several standing committees, each of which has responsibility for a particular area of government (for example, finance or transport). These committees oversee the relevant government departments, may hold hearings and collect evidence on governmental operations and review departmental spending plans. Standing committees may also consider and amend bills. Standing committees consist of between sixteen and eighteen members each, and elect their chairs.

Some bills are considered by legislative committees, each of which consists of up to fifteen members. The membership of each legislative committee roughly reflects the strength of the parties in the whole House. A legislative committee is appointed on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis to study and amend a specific bill. Also, the chair of a legislative committee is not elected by the members of the committee but is instead appointed by the speaker, normally from among the speaker&#x27;s deputies. Most bills, however, are referred to standing committees rather than legislative committees.

The House may also create &quot;ad hoc&quot; committees to study matters other than bills. Such committees are known as special committees. Each such body, like a legislative committee, may consist of no more than fifteen members. Other committees include joint committees, which include both members of the House of Commons and senators; such committees may hold hearings and oversee government, but do not revise legislation.

== Members and electoral districts ==
=== Prerequisites and Qualifications ===

Under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, Parliament is empowered to determine the qualifications of members of the House of Commons. The present qualifications are outlined in the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot;, which was passed in 2000. Under the Act, individuals must be eligible voters as of the day of nomination, to stand as a candidate. Thus, minors and individuals who are not citizens of Canada are not allowed to become candidates. The &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot; also bars prisoners from standing for election (although they may vote). Moreover, individuals found guilty of election-related crimes are prohibited from becoming members for five years (in some cases, seven years) after conviction.

The Act also prohibits certain officials from standing for the House of Commons. These officers include members of provincial and territorial legislatures (although this was not always the case), sheriffs, crown attorneys, most judges, and election officers. The chief electoral officer (the head of Elections Canada, the federal agency responsible for conducting elections) is prohibited from standing as candidate and, until recently, was prohibited from voting. Finally, under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, a member of the Senate may not also become a member of the House of Commons, and MPs must give up their seats when appointed to the Senate or the bench.

== General elections ==
Elections Canada is the independent, non-partisan agency responsible for conducting federal elections and referendums.
General elections occur whenever parliament is dissolved by the governor general on the monarch&#x27;s behalf. The timing of the dissolution has historically been chosen by the Prime minister. The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, provides that a parliament last no longer than five years. Canadian election law requires that elections must be held on the third Monday in October in the fourth year after the last election, subject to the discretion of the Crown. Campaigns must be at least 36 days long. Candidates are usually nominated by political parties. A candidate can run independently, although it is rare for such a candidate to win. Most successful independent candidates have been incumbents who were expelled from their political parties (for example, John Nunziata in 1997 or Jody Wilson-Raybould in 2019) or who failed to win their parties&#x27; nomination (for example, Chuck Cadman in 2004). Most Canadian candidates are chosen in meetings called by their party&#x27;s local association. In practice, the candidate who signs up the most local party members generally wins the nomination.

To run for a seat in the house, candidates must file nomination papers bearing the signatures of at least 50 or 100 constituents (depending on the size of the electoral district). Each electoral district returns one member using the first-past-the-post electoral system, under which the candidate with a plurality of votes wins. To vote, one must be a citizen of Canada and at least eighteen years of age. Declining the ballot, which is possible in several provinces, is not an option under current federal regulations.

Once elected, a member of Parliament normally continues to serve until the next dissolution of parliament. If a member dies, resigns, or ceases to be qualified, their seat falls vacant. It is also possible for the House of Commons to expel a member, but this power is only exercised when the member has engaged in serious misconduct or criminal activity. Formerly, MPs appointed to the cabinet were expected to resign their seats, though this practice ceased in 1931. In each case, a vacancy may be filled by a by-election in the appropriate electoral district. The first-past-the-post system is used in by-elections, as in general elections.

=== Electoral constituencies / ridings ===

The House of Commons has 338 members, each of whom represents a single electoral district (also called a &quot;riding&quot;). The constitution specifies a basic minimum of 295 electoral districts, but additional seats are allocated according to various clauses. Seats are distributed among the provinces in proportion to population, as determined by each decennial census, subject to the following exceptions made by the constitution. Firstly, the &quot;senatorial clause&quot; guarantees that each province will have at least as many MPs as senators. Secondly, the &quot;grandfather clause&quot; guarantees each province has at least as many Members of Parliament now as it had in 1985. (This was amended in 2021 to be the number of members in the 43rd Canadian Parliament.)

As a result of these clauses, smaller provinces and territories that have experienced a relative decline in population have become over-represented in the House. Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta are under-represented in proportion to their populations, while Quebec&#x27;s representation is close to the national average. The other six provinces (Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador) are over-represented. Boundary commissions, appointed by the federal government for each province, have the task of drawing the boundaries of the electoral districts in each province. Territorial representation is independent of the population; each territory is entitled to only one seat. The &quot;electoral quotient&quot; was defined by legislation as 111,166 for the redistribution of seats after the 2011 census and is adjusted following each decennial census by multiplying it by the average of the percentage of population change of each province since the previous decennial census. The population of the province is then divided by the electoral quotient to equal the base provincial-seat allocation. The &quot;special clauses&quot; are then applied to increase the number of seats for certain provinces, bringing the total number of seats (with the three seats for the territories) to 338.

The most recent redistribution of seats occurred subsequent to the 2011 census. The &quot;Fair Representation Act&quot; was passed and given royal assent on December 16, 2011, and effectively allocated fifteen additional seats to Ontario, six new seats each to Alberta and British Columbia, and three more to Quebec.

A new redistribution began in October 2021 subsequent to the 2021 census, it is expected to go into effect at the earliest for any federal election called after April 2024. After initial controversy that Quebec would lose a seat in the redistribution under the existing representation formula established by the Fair Representation Act, the &quot;Preserving Provincial Representation in the House of Commons Act&quot; was passed and given royal assent on June 23, 2022, and effectively allocated three additional seats to Alberta and one new seat each to Ontario and British Columbia.

The following tables summarize representation in the House of Commons by province and territory:


== Roles and procedures ==
Though it does not formally elect the prime minister, the House of Commons indirectly controls who becomes prime minister. By convention, the prime minister is answerable to and must maintain the support of, the House of Commons. Thus, whenever the office of prime minister falls vacant, the governor general has the duty of appointing the person most likely to command the support of the House—normally the leader of the largest party in the lower house, although the system allows a coalition of two or more parties. This has not happened in the Canadian federal parliament but has occurred in Canadian provinces. The leader of the second-largest party (or in the case of a coalition, the largest party out of government) usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition. Moreover, the prime minister is, by unwritten convention, a member of the House of Commons, rather than of the Senate. Only two prime ministers governed from the Senate: Sir John Abbott (1891–1892) and Sir Mackenzie Bowell (1894–1896). Both men got the job following the death of a prime minister and did not contest elections.

=== Meeting times and proceedures ===
The House usually sits Monday to Friday from late January to mid-June and from mid-September to mid-December according to an established calendar, though it can modify the calendar if additional or fewer sittings are required. During these periods, the House generally rises for one week per month to allow members to work in their constituencies. Sittings of the House are open to the public. Proceedings are broadcast over cable and satellite television and over live streaming video on the Internet by CPAC owned by a consortium of Canadian cable companies. They are also recorded in text form in print and online in Hansard, the official report of parliamentary debates.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; establishes a quorum of twenty members (including the member presiding) for the House of Commons. Any member may request a count of the members to ascertain the presence of a quorum; if however, the speaker feels that at least twenty members are clearly in the Chamber, the request may be denied. If a count does occur, and reveals that fewer than twenty members are present, the speaker orders bells to be rung, so that other members on the parliamentary precincts may come to the Chamber. If, after a second count, a quorum is still not present, the speaker must adjourn the House until the next sitting day.
The member of the Government responsible for steering legislation through the House is leader of the Government in the House of Commons. The &quot;government house leader&quot; (as they are more commonly known) is a member of Parliament selected by the prime minister and holds cabinet rank. The leader manages the schedule of the House of Commons and attempts to secure the Opposition&#x27;s support for the Government&#x27;s legislative agenda.

The leader manages the schedule of the House of Commons and attempts to secure the Opposition&#x27;s support for the Government&#x27;s legislative agenda.

=== Question period ===
The House of Commons scrutinizes the ministers of the Crown through &quot;Question Period&quot;, a daily forty-five-minute period during which members have the opportunity to ask questions of the prime minister and other Cabinet ministers. Questions must relate to the responding minister&#x27;s official government activities, not to their activities as a party leader or as a private Member of Parliament. Members may also question committee chairmen on the work of their respective committees. Members of each party are entitled to the number of questions proportional to the party caucus&#x27; strength in the house. In addition to questions asked orally during Question Period, Members of Parliament may also make inquiries in writing.

In times where there is a majority government, the House of Commons&#x27; scrutiny of the government is weak. Since elections use the first-past-the-post electoral system, the governing party tends to enjoy a large majority in the Commons; there is often limited need to compromise with other parties. (Minority governments, however, are not uncommon.) Modern Canadian political parties are so tightly organized that they leave relatively little room for free action by their MPs. In many cases, MPs may be expelled from their parties for voting against the instructions of party leaders. As well, the major parties require candidates&#x27; nominations to be signed by party leaders, thus giving the leaders the power to, effectively, end a politician&#x27;s career. Thus, defeats of majority governments on issues of confidence are very rare. Paul Martin&#x27;s Liberal minority government lost a vote of no confidence in 2005; the last time this had occurred was in 1979, when Joe Clark&#x27;s Progressive Conservative minority government was defeated after a term of just six months.

=== Role in Federation ===
As a Westminster modelled democracy, the Government of Canada, or more specifically the Governor-in-Council, exercising the executive power on behalf of the prime minister and Cabinet, enjoys a complementary relationship with the House of Commons—similar to the UK model, and in contrast to the US model of separation of powers.

The prime minister stays in office by retaining the confidence of the House of Commons. The lower house may indicate its lack of support for the ruling party administration by rejecting a motion of confidence, or by passing a motion of no confidence. Important bills that form a part of the government&#x27;s agenda are generally considered matters of confidence, as is any taxation or spending bill and the annual budget. When a government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons, the prime minister is obliged to either resign or request the governor general to dissolve parliament, thereby precipitating a general election. The governor general may theoretically refuse to dissolve parliament, thereby forcing the prime minister to resign. The last instance of a governor general refusing to grant a dissolution was in 1926.

In modern times the government of Canada has strengthened its relationship to the First Nations groups living in Canada in place of the Crown.

=== Dissolution of term ===
Except when compelled to request a dissolution by an adverse vote on a confidence issue, the prime minister is allowed to choose the timing of dissolutions, and consequently the timing of general elections. The time chosen reflects political considerations, and is generally most opportune for the prime minister&#x27;s party. However, no parliamentary term can last for more than five years from the first sitting of Parliament; a dissolution is automatic upon the expiry of this period. Normally, Parliaments do not last for full five-year terms; prime ministers typically ask for dissolutions after about three or four years. In 2006, the Harper government introduced a bill to set fixed election dates every four years, although snap elections are still permitted. The bill was approved by Parliament and has now become law.

Whatever the reasonthe expiry of parliament&#x27;s term, the choice of the prime minister, or a government defeat in the House of Commonsa dissolution is followed by general elections. If the prime minister&#x27;s party retains its majority in the House of Commons, then the prime minister may remain in power. On the other hand, if their party has lost its majority, the prime minister may resign or may attempt to retain leadership by winning support from members of other parties. A prime minister may resign even if he or she is not defeated at the polls (for example, for personal health reasons); in such a case, the new leader of the outgoing prime minister&#x27;s party becomes prime minister.

=== Legislative functions ===

Although legislation may be introduced in either chamber, most bills originate in the House of Commons.

In conformity with the British model, the Lower House alone is authorized to originate bills imposing taxes or appropriating public funds. This restriction on the power of the Senate is not merely a matter of convention, but is explicitly stated in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. Otherwise, the power of the two Houses of Parliament is theoretically equal; the approval of each is necessary for a bill&#x27;s passage.

In practice, however, the House of Commons is the dominant chamber of Parliament, with the Senate very rarely exercising its powers in a way that opposes the will of the democratically elected chamber. The last major bill defeated in the Senate came in 2010, when a bill passed by the Commons concerning climate change was rejected in the Senate.

A clause in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; permits the governor general (with the approval of the monarch) to appoint up to eight extra senators to resolve a deadlock between the two houses. The clause was invoked only once, in 1990, when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney advised the appointment of an additional eight senators to secure the Senate&#x27;s approval for the Goods and Services Tax.

=== Debates ===
During debates, members may only speak if called upon by the speaker (or, as is most often the case, the deputy presiding). The speaker is responsible for ensuring that members of all parties have an opportunity to be heard. The speaker also determines who is to speak if two or more members rise simultaneously, but the decision may be altered by the House. Motions must be moved by one member and seconded by another before debate may begin. Some motions, however, are non-debatable.

Speeches may be made in either of Canada&#x27;s official languages (English and French), and it is customary for bilingual members of parliament to respond to these in the same language they were made in. It is common for bilingual MPs to switch between languages during speeches. Members must address their speeches to the presiding officer, not the House, using the words &quot;Mr. Speaker&quot; () or &quot;Madam Speaker&quot; (). Other members must be referred to in the third person. Traditionally, members do not refer to each other by name, but by constituency or cabinet post, using forms such as &quot;the honourable member for [electoral district]&quot; or &quot;the minister of...&quot; Members&#x27; names are routinely used only during roll call votes, in which members stand and are named to have their vote recorded; at that point they are referred to by title (&quot;Ms.&quot; or &quot;mister&quot; for Anglophones and &quot;madame&quot;, &quot;mademoiselle&quot;, or &quot;monsieur&quot; for Francophones) and last name, except where members have the same or similar last names, at which point they would be listed by their name and riding (&quot;&quot;M. Massé, Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia; Mr. Masse, Windsor West...&quot;).

No member may speak more than once on the same question (except that the mover of a motion is entitled to make one speech at the beginning of the debate and another at the end). Moreover, tediously repetitive or irrelevant remarks are prohibited, as are written remarks read into the record (although this behaviour is creeping into the modern debate). The speaker may order a member making such remarks to cease speaking. The Standing Orders of the House of Commons prescribe time limits for speeches. The limits depend on the nature of the motion but are most commonly between ten and twenty minutes. However, under certain circumstances, the prime minister, the Opposition leader, and others are entitled to make longer speeches. The debate may be further restricted by the passage of &quot;time allocation&quot; motions. Alternatively, the House may end debate more quickly by passing a motion for &quot;closure&quot;.

=== Member roll-call ===
When the debate concludes, the motion in question is put to a vote. The House first votes by voice vote; the presiding officer puts the question, and members respond either &quot;yea&quot; (in favour of the motion) or &quot;nay&quot; (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote, but five or more members may challenge the assessment, thereby forcing a recorded vote (known as a division, although, in fact, the House does not divide for votes the way the British House of Commons does). First, members in favour of the motion rise, so that the clerks may record their names and votes. Then, the same procedure is repeated for members who oppose the motion. There are no formal means for recording an abstention, though a member may informally abstain by remaining seated during the division. If there is an equality of votes, the speaker has a casting vote.

The member of the Government responsible for steering legislation through the House is leader of the Government in the House of Commons. The &quot;government house leader&quot; (as they are more commonly known) is a member of Parliament selected by the prime minister and holds cabinet rank. The leader manages the schedule of the House of Commons and attempts to secure the Opposition&#x27;s support for the Government&#x27;s legislative agenda.

The outcome of most votes is largely known beforehand since political parties in Cabinet normally instruct members on how to vote. A party normally entrusts some members of Parliament, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that all party members vote as desired. Members of Parliament do not tend to vote against such instructions since those who do so are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members may be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, the independence of members of Parliament tends to be extremely low, and &quot;backbench rebellions&quot; by members discontent with their party&#x27;s policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce &quot;free votes&quot;, allowing members to vote as they please. This may be done on moral issues and is routine on private members&#x27; bills.

=== Points of order ===
The speaker controls debates by calling on members to speak. If a member in the house believes that a rule (or standing order) has been breached, they may raise a &quot;point of order&quot;, on which the speaker makes a ruling that is not subject to any debate or appeal. The speaker may also discipline members who fail to observe the rules of the House. When presiding, the speaker must remain impartial. The speaker also oversees the administration of the House and is chair of the Board of Internal Economy, the governing body for the House of Commons. The current speaker of the House of Commons is Greg Fergus.

== Symbols ==
The Commons&#x27; mace has the shape of a medieval mace which was used as a weapon, but in brass and ornate in detail and symbolism. At its bulbous head is a replica of the Imperial State Crown; the choice of this crown for the Commons&#x27; mace differentiates it from the Senate&#x27;s mace, which has St. Edward&#x27;s Crown at its apex. The Commons mace is placed upon the table in front of the speaker for the duration of the sitting with the crown pointing towards the prime minister and the other cabinet ministers, who advise the monarch and governor general and are accountable to this chamber (in the Senate chamber, the mace points towards the throne, where the king has the right to sit himself).

Carved above the speaker&#x27;s chair is the royal arms of the United Kingdom. This chair was a gift from the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association in 1921, to replace the chair that was destroyed by the fire of 1916, and was a replica of the chair in the British House of Commons at the time. These arms at its apex were considered the royal arms for general purposes throughout the British Empire at the time. Since 1931, however, Canada has been an independent country and the Canadian coat of arms are now understood to be the royal arms of the monarch. Escutcheons of the same original royal arms can be found on each side of the speaker&#x27;s chair held by a lion and a unicorn.

In response to a campaign by Bruce Hicks for the Canadianization of symbols of royal authority and to advance the identity of parliamentary institutions, a proposal that was supported by speakers of the House of Commons John Fraser and Gilbert Parent, a Commons committee was eventually struck following a motion by MP Derek Lee, before which Hicks and Robert Watt, the first chief herald of Canada, was called as the only two expert witnesses, though Senator Serge Joyal joined the committee on behalf of the Senate. Commons&#x27; speaker Peter Milliken then asked the governor general to authorize such a symbol. In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons and the House of Lords use the royal badge of the portcullis, in green and red respectively, to represent those institutions and to distinguish them from the government, the courts and the monarch. The Canadian Heraldic Authority on April 15, 2008, granted the House of Commons, as an institution, a badge consisting of the chamber&#x27;s mace (as described above) behind the escutcheon of the shield of the royal arms of Canada (representing the monarch, in whose name the House of Commons deliberates).

== Chamber and building characteristics ==
=== Chamber design ===
The current and original Canadian House of Commons chamber was influenced by the British House of Commons rectangular layout and that of the original St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel in the Palace of Westminster. The difference from the British layout is with the use of individual chairs and tables for members, absent in the British Commons&#x27; design.

With the exception of the legislatures in Nunavut (circular seating), the Northwest Territories (circular seating), and Manitoba (U-shaped seating), all other Canadian provincial legislatures share the common design of the Canadian House of Commons.

The Department of Public Works and Government Services undertook work during the 41st Parliament to determine how the seating arrangement could be modified to accommodate the additional 30 seats added in the 2015 election. Ultimately, new &quot;theatre&quot; seats were designed, with five seats in a row at one desk, the seats pulling down for use. Such seat sets now form almost the entire length of the last two rows on each side of the chamber.

=== Seating plan ===

Like the Senate, the House of Commons meets on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. The Commons Chamber is modestly decorated in green, in contrast with the more lavishly furnished red Senate Chamber. The arrangement is similar to the design of the Chamber of the British House of Commons. The seats are evenly divided between both sides of the Chamber, three sword-lengths apart (about three metres). The speaker&#x27;s chair (which can be adjusted for height) is at the north end of the Chamber. In front of it is the Table of the House, on which rests the ceremonial mace. Various &quot;table officers&quot;—clerks and other officials—sit at the table, ready to advise the speaker on procedure when necessary. Members of the Government sit on the benches on the speaker&#x27;s right, while members of the Opposition occupy the benches on the speaker&#x27;s left. Government ministers sit around the prime minister, who is traditionally assigned the 11th seat in the front row on the speaker&#x27;s right-hand side. The leader of the Official Opposition sits directly across from the prime minister and is surrounded by a Shadow Cabinet or critics for the government portfolios. The remaining party leaders sit in the front rows. Other members of Parliament who do not hold any kind of special responsibilities are known as &quot;backbenchers&quot;.

Seating plan for the current House of Commons:
* Party leaders are italicized. Bold indicates cabinet minister.
=== Member&#x27;s offices ===
Off Parliament Hill, MPs have some offices at the Justice Building or Confederation Building down Wellington Street near the Supreme Court.

=== Renovations ===
The current chamber is currently undergoing an estimated decade-long restoration and renovation, which began in December 2018. Parliamentarians have relocated to the courtyard of the 159-year-old West Block which also underwent seven years of renovations and repairs to get ready for the move. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau marked the closing of the Centre Block on December 12, 2018. The final sittings of both the House of Commons and the Senate in Centre Block took place on December 13, 2018.

<text>Ingeborg Bachmann (; 25 June 1926 – 17 October 1973) was an Austrian poet and author. She is regarded as one of the major voices of German-language literature in the 20th century. In 1963, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by German philologist Harald Patzer.

==Early life and education==
Bachmann was born in Klagenfurt, in the Austrian state of Carinthia, the daughter of Olga (née Haas) and Matthias Bachmann, a schoolteacher. Her father was an early member of the Austrian National Socialist Party. She had a sister, Isolde, and a brother, Heinz.

She studied philosophy, psychology, German philology, and law at the universities of Innsbruck, Graz, and Vienna. In 1949, she received her PhD from the University of Vienna with her dissertation titled &quot;The Critical Reception of the Existential Philosophy of Martin Heidegger&quot;; her thesis adviser was Victor Kraft.

==Career==

After graduating, Bachmann worked as a scriptwriter and editor at the Allied radio station &quot;Rot-Weiss-Rot&quot;, a job that enabled her to obtain an overview of contemporary literature and also supplied her with a decent income, making possible proper literary work. Her first radio dramas were published by the station. Her literary career was enhanced by contact with Hans Weigel (littérateur and sponsor of young post-war literature) and the literary circle known as Gruppe 47, whose members also included Ilse Aichinger, Paul Celan, Heinrich Böll, Marcel Reich-Ranicki and Günter Grass.

In 1953, she moved to Rome, Italy, where she spent the large part of the following years working on poems, essays and short stories as well as opera libretti in collaboration with Hans Werner Henze, which soon brought with them international fame and numerous awards.

=== Writings ===
Bachmann&#x27;s doctoral dissertation expresses her growing disillusionment with Heideggerian existentialism, which was in part resolved through her growing interest in Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; significantly influenced her relationship to language. During her lifetime, Bachmann was known mostly for her two collections of poetry, &quot;Die gestundete Zeit&quot; (Time Deferred) and &quot;Anrufung des Grossen Bären&quot; (Invocation of Ursa Major).

Bachmann&#x27;s literary work focuses on themes like personal boundaries, establishment of the truth, and philosophy of language, the latter in the tradition of Wittgenstein. Many of her prose works represent the struggles of women to survive and to find a voice in post-war society. She also addresses the histories of imperialism and fascism, in particular, the persistence of imperialist ideas in the present. Fascism was a recurring theme in her writings. In her novel &quot;Der Fall Franza&quot; (&quot;The Case of Franza&quot;) Bachmann argued that fascism had not died in 1945 but had survived in the German speaking world of the 1960s in human relations and particularly in men&#x27;s oppression of women. In Germany the achievements of the women&#x27;s rights campaign at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century had been systematically undone by the fascist Nazi regime in the 1930s. Bachmann&#x27;s engagement with fascism followed that of other women writers who in the immediate post-war period dealt with fascism from a woman&#x27;s perspective, such as Anna Seghers, Ilse Aichinger, Ingeborg Drewitz and Christa Wolf.

A crisis of &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot;, along with the fear of the continued existence of National Socialism within democracy, suffuses Bachmann&#x27;s oeuvre. In her work for radio, this takes the form of a self-conscious pivoting between the possibility of freedom and the inevitability of imprisonment. Her first radio play &quot;Ein Geschäft mit Träumen&quot; (&quot;A Shop for Dreams&quot;) is concerned with the inhumanity of violence and oppression. &quot;Der gute Gott von Manhattan&quot; (&quot;The Good God of Manhattan&quot;) consciously echoes Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Good Person of Szechwan&quot;, as it tackles the impossibility of Good and Love surviving in capitalist, consumerist societies. In her analysis of Bachmann&#x27;s radio drama &quot;Die Zikaden&quot; (&quot;The Cicadas&quot;), which was written in Ischia and then Naples towards the end of 1954, and first broadcast on Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) on 25 March 1955, Lucy Jeffery states thatThe transitory existence of the exiled or marginalised writer who escapes prejudice, conflict, and dominance is paralleled by the experience of the refugee. The feeling of unsettledness is measured against the desire to find that utopian land away (both geographically and temporally) from suffering. Yet, as Bachmann knows too well, escapism is a temporary heterotopia where guilt and longing cannot be kept at bay. Similar themes can also be found throughout Bachmann&#x27;s writings in works such as &quot;Ein Wildermuth&quot; (&quot;A Wildermuth&quot;), included in &quot;Das dreißigste Jahr&quot; (&quot;The Thirtieth Year: Stories&quot;, published in 1961), &quot;Malina&quot; (published in 1971), and &quot;Kriegstagebuch&quot; (&quot;War Diary&quot;, published posthumously in 2010).

Bachmann was also in the vanguard of Austrian women writers who discovered in their private lives the political realities from which they attempted to achieve emancipation. Bachmann&#x27;s writings and those of Barbara Frischmuth, Brigitte Schwaiger and Anna Mitgutsch were widely published in Germany. Male Austrian authors such as Franz Innerhofer, Josef Winkler and Peter Turrini wrote equally popular works on traumatic experiences of socialisation. Often these authors produced their works for major German publishing houses. After Bachmann&#x27;s death in 1973, Austrian writers such as Thomas Bernhard, Peter Handke and Elfriede Jelinek continued the tradition of Austrian literature in Germany.

=== Lectures ===
Between November 1959 and February 1960 Bachmann gave five lectures on poetics at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Known as the &quot;Frankfurter Vorlesungen: Probleme zeitgenössischer Dichtung&quot; (&quot;Frankfurt Lectures: Problems of Contemporary Writings&quot;) they are historically and substantively Bachmann&#x27;s central work. In it she explained recurring themes in her early literary publications and she discussed the function of literature in society. Bachmann insisted that literature had to be viewed in its historic context, thus foreshadowing a rising interest in studying the connection between literary discourse and the contemporary understanding of history.
In the first lecture on &quot;Fragen und Scheinfragen&quot; (Questions and Pseudo-Questions) Bachmann focused on the role of writers in the post-war society and listed some essential questions that she defines &quot;destructive and frightening in their simplicity&quot;. They are: why write? What do we mean by change and why do we want it through art? What are the limitations of the writer who wants to bring about change? According to Karen Achberger Bachmann views the great literary accomplishments of the twentieth century as expressions in language and poetic form of a moral and intellectual renewal in the individual writers; it is the writer&#x27;s new thinking and experiencing that forms the core of their literary works, and lets them come closer to a new language. (…) Bachmann stresses the need for a new language inhabited by a new spirit. (…) She also associates literary renewal with writers on the verge of silence due to self-doubt and despair over the impotence of language and she cites in this context Hofmannsthal&#x27;s &quot;Ein Brief&quot; (1902) … as the first articulation of this dilemma.

In the second lecture, &quot;Über Gedichte&quot; (On Poetry), she distinguished poetry with its new power to grasp reality in its language, from other genres such as novels and plays. With reference to Günter Eich and Stefan George she identified a new generation of &quot;poet-prophets&quot; whose mission consisted in leading the world to the discovery of an &quot;ever purer heaven of art&quot; (George). Bachmann set these poets apart from the Surrealists who aspired to violence and the Futurists who claimed that &quot;war is beautiful&quot;. She argued that these two movements exemplified &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; and that the careers of Gottfried Benn and Ezra Pound exemplified the &quot;easy friendship between pure aestheticism with political barbarism&quot; (Achberger). She referenced Kafka on the need (with his words) to &quot;take the axe to the frozen sea in us&quot; and refuse to remain indifferent to the injustices that are perpetrated before our eyes. In the lecture she also named writings of Nelly Sachs, Marie Luise Kaschnitz, Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Paul Celan as examples of his concept of new poetry.

In the third lecture, on &quot;Das schreibende Ich&quot; (The writing &quot;I&quot;), Bachmann addressed the question of the first-person narrator. She was concerned with the &quot;accountability and authority, the authenticity and reliability, of the person in the position of narrating the work&quot; (Achberger). She distinguished between the unproblematic &quot;I&quot; in letters and diaries, which conceals the person from the author, and the unproblematic &quot;I&quot; in memoirs, in which a &quot;&#x27;naive&#x27; handling of the first person is requested (Achberger). She argued that Henry Miller and Céline placed &quot;themselves and their personal experience directly at the centre of their novels&quot; (Achberger). She referenced Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; and Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The House of Dead&quot; as first-person narrators of the inner story. She also argued that narrators could provide a new treatment of time (for example Italo Svevo), of material (for example Proust) or of space (for example Hans Henny Jahnn). According to Bachmann, in the modern novel the &quot;I&quot; had &quot;shifted: the narrator no longer lives in the story, but rather, the story lives inside the narrator&quot; (Achberger).

In the fourth lecture, &quot;Der Umgang mit Namen&quot; (The close association with names), Bachmann explored how names could have a life of their own. She discussed the use of names in contemporary literature. She identified &quot;denied names&quot; such as in Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Castle&quot;, &quot;ironic naming&quot; by Thomas Mann, &quot;name games&quot; in Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; and instances where the identity of the character is not secured by a name but by the context, such as in Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;.

In the fifth lecture on &quot;Literatur als Utopie&quot; (Literature as Utopia), she turned to the question of what makes literature utopian. She argued that it was the process that was set in motion in the writer and reader, as a result of their interaction with literature, which made a work utopian. She argued that literature could make us aware of a lack, both in the work and in our own world. Readers could remove this lack by giving the work a chance in our time. Thus she argued that each work of literature is &quot;a realm which reaches forward and has unknown limits&quot;. Bachmann&#x27;s understanding of utopia as a direction rather than a goal, and her argument that it was the function of literature to take an utopian direction, stemmed from Robert Musil, who had analysed European modernism in his 1908 dissertation on Ernst Mach, &quot;Beitrag zur Beurteilung der Lehren Machs&quot; (Contribution to the assessment of Mach&#x27;s theories.

==Later life and death==
During her later years she suffered from alcoholism and from an addiction to medication prescribed by her doctor. A friend described it:&quot;I was deeply shocked by the magnitude of her tablet addiction. It must have been 100 per day, the bin was full of empty boxes. She looked bad, she was waxlike and pale. And her whole body was covered in bruises. I wondered what could have caused them. Then, when I saw how she slipped her Gauloise that she smoked and let it burn off on her arm, I realized: burns caused by falling cigarettes. The numerous tablets had made her body insensible to pain.&quot; 
On the night of 25 September 1973, her nightgown caught fire and she was taken to the Sant&#x27;Eugenio Hospital at 7:05 A.M. the following morning for treatment of second and third degree burns. Local police concluded that the fire was caused by a cigarette. During her stay, she experienced withdrawal symptoms from barbiturate substance abuse, though the doctors treating her were not aware of the cause. This may have contributed to her subsequent death on 17 October 1973.

== Legacy ==
Although German language writers such as Hilde Domin, Luise Rinser and Nelly Sachs had published notable works on women&#x27;s issues in the post-war period, it was only in the 1970s that a feminist movement emerged in West Germany. After her death, Bachmann became popular among feminist readers. Feminist scholars&#x27; engagement with her work after her death led to a wave of scholarship that also drew attention to her prose work. Her works gained popularity within the emerging &quot;Frauenliteratur&quot; (&quot;women&#x27;s literature&quot;) movement which struggled to find the authentic female voice. New publishing houses carried the movement, such as the feminist press &quot;Frauenoffensive&quot; (&quot;Women&#x27;s Offensive&quot;), which published writings by Verena Stefan.

In 2021, her childhood home on Henselstraße in Klagenfurt was purchased by the state of Carinthia, to be turned into a museum dedicated to her.

===The Ingeborg Bachmann Prize===
The Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, awarded annually in Klagenfurt since 1977, is named after her.

===In film===
&quot;The Dreamed Ones&quot; (&quot;Die Geträumten&quot;; 2016), is a feature film based on the almost 20-year correspondence between Bachmann and poet Paul Celan. It was directed by Ruth Beckermann and won the SCAM International Award at Cinéma du Réel 2016.

A biographical film, &quot;Ingeborg Bachmann – Journey into the Desert&quot;, starring Vicky Krieps as Bachmann and directed by Margarethe von Trotta, premiered at 73rd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2023, and gets a cinema release on 26 October 2023. The film focuses on her relationship with Max Frisch and the impact it had on her life. It also depicts her friends, composer Hans Werner Henze, and writer Adolf Opel, with whom she travelled to Egypt to experience the desert.

==Personal life==
From 1945 to 1946, Bachmann fell in love with a former member of the British Army, the Viennese Jew Jack Hamesh. In May 1948 she began in Vienna a love affair with the poet and Holocaust survivor Paul Celan. In 1955 she met the political scientist Henry Kissinger; even though he was married and had two children, the two had a romantic relationship that lasted several years. From 1958 to 1963, she lived on and off with Swiss playwright Max Frisch. Her 1971 novel, &quot;Malina&quot;, has been described as a response, at least partially, to his 1964 novel &quot;Mein Name sei Gantenbein&quot;. She never married nor had children.

<text>Yabasic (Yet Another BASIC) is a free, open-source BASIC interpreter for Microsoft Windows and Unix platforms. Yabasic was originally developed by Marc-Oliver Ihm, who released the last stable version 2.77.3 in 2016. From version 2.77.1, the project has adopted the MIT License as well as the source code being moved to GitHub to encourage others to participate in its development.

==Features==
* No line numbers (they can be used but are optional)
* Line graphics in color
* Structured programming—various block structures, named subroutines with local variables and return values
* Code modules/libraries with separate namespaces (On the other hand, composite data structures are missing)
* Option to use a graphical user interface based on the GTK library
* Self-modifying code
* &quot;Binding&quot; a Yabasic program to the interpreter, creating a standalone executable in a single file

==Other versions==
===Yab===
A version optimized for BeOS, ZETA and Haiku.

=== Flyab ===
A port of Yabasic to the Fltk toolkit called &quot;Flyab&quot; was under development. It would have been source-compatible with programs written in yab, a variant of Yabasic that enables graphical programs to be written using the BeOS API. After BeOS and its successor ZETA finally were gone, the team members around yab for BeOS decided to move to Linux and therefore chose FLTK to implement the UI parts. Ports for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux would have been possible. Flyab added the ability to Yabasic to create native graphical user interfaces on all supported platforms. Main difficulty was to fully implement the layout commands to FLTK, as used from the BeOS version. As of November 2008, the project appears to be halted.

===PlayStation 2===
Sony also packaged a version of Yabasic for the PlayStation 2 on the demo disc shipped with PS2 consoles in PAL territories so it could be considered a home computer, not just a games machine, thus bypassing European import taxes.

===Yabasic 3.0 (Unofficial)===
As a continuation of the project prior to new changes by the original author, version 3 was being developed by a team centered on Pedro Sá and Thomas Larsen, but development has halted and the project now appears to be abandoned.

<doc id="64316" wikidata="Q1648571" url="?curid=64316" title="PowerBASIC">
<text>PowerBASIC, formerly Turbo Basic, is the brand of several commercial compilers by PowerBASIC Inc. that compile a dialect of the BASIC programming language. There are both MS-DOS and Windows versions, and two kinds of the latter: Console and Windows. The MS-DOS version has a syntax similar to that of QBasic and QuickBASIC. The Windows versions use a BASIC syntax expanded to include many Windows functions, and the statements can be combined with calls to the Windows API.

==History==
The first version of the DOS compiler was published as BASIC/Z, the very first interactive compiler for CP/M and MDOS. Later it was extended to MS-DOS/PC DOS and in 1987 Borland distributed it as &quot;Turbo Basic&quot;.

&quot;Turbo Basic&quot; was originally created by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Zale (1945–2012) and bought from him by Borland. When Borland decided to stop publishing it (1989), Zale bought it back from them, renamed it PowerBASIC and set up PowerBASIC Inc. to continue support and development of it; it was later called PBDOS.

PowerBASIC went on to develop BASIC compilers for Windows, first PBWIN — their flagship product — and then PBCC, described below.

On November 6, 2012, Robert Zale, the creator of PowerBASIC, died. For a time, it was assumed that the company might cease operations. His wife, Vivian Zale, posted on 8 March 2014 to the PowerBASIC forums a statement that the company would continue in operation. On May 10, 2015, Vivian Zale announced that work was continuing on new versions of PowerBASIC compilers.

On November 2, 2016, Vivian Zale announced her intention to seek a buyer for the company.

On January 31, 2017, Adam Drake announced Drake Software had acquired the PowerBASIC source code from PowerBASIC, Inc., with the intention of updating and improving the functionality of the product. This was later confirmed by Vivian Zale with a forum post thanking the members for their support.

When Bob Zale died, PBWin11 and PBCC7 were in beta testing, and 64-bit compilers and PB/Pro (PBWin and CC in one compiler) were in the alpha stages. However, development of PowerBASIC products has stopped. No new version has been released since v10.03 (13 years ago as of May 2024). No 64-bit version or beta release has been announced. No development activity has been reported. No corrections (such as adding the correct DPI settings for the IDE) have been released. PowerBASIC Tools LLC still sells new licenses for the 32-bit Windows compilers.

==Compilers==
PowerBASIC programs are self-contained and use no runtime file to execute. In all versions of the compiler, the applications compile without external libraries, though it can use such libraries if needed. PBDOS creates 16-bit DOS MZ executable files, while PBWIN and PBCC create 32-bit Portable Executable (PE) files.

===Turbo Basic===
Borland&#x27;s Turbo Basic contains extensions to classic BASIC (without breaking compatibility), such as a drawing API and mouse access.

Unlike most BASIC implementations of its time, Turbo Basic was a full compiler which generated native code for MS-DOS. Other implementations were either interpreters, or relied heavily on a runtime library. The integrated development environment could run a BASIC program internally for traditional BASIC debugging (see sample below), or generate an MS-DOS stand-alone executable file that could be run on other systems without the Turbo Basic product or runtime libraries.

====Code example====

The following program is an example of the ALGOL-like BASIC dialect that Turbo Basic supported. Unlike traditional BASIC, which used line numbers and had limited control structures and no support for ALGOL-like subroutines, modern BASIC dialects starting at this period were extended to make the language compatible with modern structured programming style by making line numbers optional and adding the control structures and subroutine definitions needed for structured programming.
INPUT &quot;What is your name?: &quot;, n$
PRINT &quot;Hello &quot;; n$
DO
 s$ = &quot;&quot;
 INPUT &quot;How many stars do you want to print&quot;; s
 FOR i = 1 TO s
 s$ = s$ + &quot;*&quot;
 NEXT i
 PRINT s$
 DO
 INPUT &quot;Do you want to print more stars&quot;; q$
 LOOP WHILE LEN(q$) = 0
 q$ = LCASE$(LEFT$(q$, 1))
LOOP WHILE q$ = &quot;y&quot;
PRINT &quot;Goodbye &quot;; n$
(codice_1 is a string and codice_2 is a single-precision floating-point (number). They are separate variables.)

Like the other Borland products of this era, the code executes within the integrated development environment.

===PowerBASIC for DOS (PBDos)===
PBDOS includes an integrated development environment (IDE) and supports DOS 3.30 and all later versions.

===PowerBASIC Console Compiler (PBCC)===

PBCC is a 32-bit compiler for the Windows 9x series and Windows NT series of operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. PBCC applications can use dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The compiler comes with an IDE including an editor and stepping debugger.

No knowledge of Windows programming is required to create character mode or graphical applications with this compiler. PBCC-compiled executables can also be used as Common Gateway Interface executables (for web servers).

PBCC creates only executables, not DLLs. (PBWin — see below — can create both.)

===PowerBASIC Compiler for Windows (PBWin)===
PBWin is a 32-bit compiler compatible with the Windows 9x series and the Windows NT series of operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 (8.1), and Windows 10. PBWin can create dynamic-link libraries. PBWin applications can read dynamic-link libraries]. PBWin comes with a compiler, IDE with editor, and stepping debugger.

====Dynamic Dialog Tools (DDT)====
You can create an application&#x27;s graphical user interface using the Windows API, or by using the built-in DDT language extensions. The group of BASIC statements which wrap Windows API functions, particularly in the creation and handling of dialog boxes and child controls, is collectively known as Dynamic Dialog Tools. Using DDT requires less coding than to create a similar program using the Windows API. Using the DDT and the Windows API (known as SDK style as in Microsoft Windows SDK) are not mutually exclusive.

====Trial versions of compilers====
PowerBASIC renamed PBWin v9.07 and PB/CC v5.07 as &quot;Classic PBWin&quot; and &quot;Classic PB/CC&quot;, respectively, and on November 1, 2016, offered them for a short time through their online store as free, no-nag, trial versions along with PBForms v1.0 (PowerBASIC Forms).

==Tools==

===PB Forms===
PowerBASIC Forms, available for purchase separately, is a graphical user interface design tool add-on for PBWin. It automatically produces source code using the DDT language extension that creates forms using the Windows graphical user interface.

===COM Browser===
The PowerBASIC COM Browser, which comes with PBWin, is an application that exposes the interfaces, methods, and properties of COM objects, as described by type-library files. The PowerBASIC COM Browser exports an interface structure of a COM object for early-binding purposes in PowerBASIC code, and gives syntax reference and context-help on the interface members exposed by a COM object.

==Programming language==

===Characteristics===
PowerBASIC is a native-code BASIC compiler whose reported merits are simplicity of use and speed compared to other languages.
Although the compiled code is fast enough for most purposes, the compilers also support inline assembler which can be used for hand optimization of critical routines. The Windows compilers (PBWin &amp; PBCC) support almost all of the x86 instruction set, including FPU, SIMD, and MMX, the main exceptions being a few which are useful mostly to systems programmers. One can insert any unsupported instructions by inserting their opcodes with the &quot;db&quot;, &quot;dw&quot;, and &quot;dd&quot; statements. Lines of assembler code can be freely interspersed with lines of BASIC code, although one must always consider the potential interactions between the two types of code.

===Hello world===
Hello world is used to give a very small example of the syntax used by a programming language and is often the smallest possible program for any given programming language.

Here is an example of a PBCC hello world program. By default PBCC creates a console window at runtime for displaying output. The use of Waitkey$ in this example prevents the console window from automatically closing until the operator sees the displayed text.
Function PBMain

 Print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
 Waitkey$

End Function
Here is the PBWin version, which displays a Windows &quot;dialog&quot; message box.
Function PBMain

 MsgBox &quot;Hello, World!&quot;

End Function
===Structured control statements===
These structured control statements eliminate many instances that would require the use of GOTO and labels:
* iterate - skips ahead to the next iteration of the loop containing it (iterate do, iterate loop, iterate for), like the continue statement in most languages
* exit - sends execution to just after the loop (exit for, exit do, exit loop), conditional (exit if, exit select), or block (exit function, exit sub) containing it, like the break statement in most languages

===Object-oriented programming===
PBWin and PBCC support object-oriented programming in the form of COM classes, however the compilers do not force you to use OOP, it is merely an option. In-process and out-of-process COM Servers can also be built using these compilers.

====Graphics====
Both the Console Compiler and Windows Compiler can create graphic windows. The GRAPHICs statements are higher-level than Windows&#x27; Graphics Device Interface (GDI) library functions.

=====Elements of the GRAPHIC statements=====
GRAPHIC WINDOWS are dedicated dialogs each containing a single control which fills the dialog&#x27;s client area. GRAPHIC controls are child windows which support the same GRAPHIC drawing functionality as GRAPHIC windows. GRAPHIC BITMAPS are also defined, again supporting the GRAPHIC drawing functionality, but as purely memory objects, like Windows bitmaps or DIB sections. Keyboard and mouse handling statements are included among the GRAPHIC statements. Character output to a GRAPHIC target uses fonts specified via the FONT NEW statement.

=====Creating a GRAPHIC WINDOW application=====
A GRAPHIC WINDOW is the equivalent of a Windows dialog box containing a static control on which drawing operations can be done. A single BASIC statement will create a GRAPHIC WINDOW and specify its size, position and title. It is not essential to specify a WNDPROC for the GRAPHIC WINDOW. A short source code example for a complete GRAPHIC WINDOW application follows:

#Compile Exe &#x27; using either PBCC6 or PBWIN10 compiler
#Dim All

Function PBMain
 Local GW As Dword
 &#x27; start a GRAPHIC WINDOW
 Graphic Window New &quot;graphic window&quot;, 100, 100, 200, 200 to GW
 &#x27; show a coloured disc
 Graphic Ellipse (10, 10)-(190, 190), %rgb_Red, %rgb_SeaGreen, 0
 &#x27; wait for a keypress
 Graphic Waitkey$
End Function
=====Comparison of PB GRAPHIC statements with the GDI API=====
Using PB GRAPHIC statements, a GRAPHIC (WINDOW, BITMAP, or control) is first selected as the current GRAPHIC target, then operations are done on it without requiring it to be identified again. Contrast this with the GDI API approach, where the Device Context handle is required for every drawing operation.

It is not necessary when using the PB GRAPHIC statements to define a brush or pen as a separate entity, nor is it necessary to redraw the GRAPHIC target (when in view) in response to Windows messages such as WM_PAINT and WM_ERASEBKGND. GRAPHIC targets are persistent.

When GRAPHIC targets are attached, a REDRAW option can be specified which buffers the results of drawing operations until they are specifically requested. Using this technique reduces flicker in a similar way to the technique of drawing on memory DCs when using the GDI API.

Pixel operations are possible using the GRAPHIC GET|SET PIXEL statements, in a manner similar to GetPixel/SetPixel of the GDI API. GRAPHIC GET BITS allows the entire bitmap to be loaded into a dynamic string. This can be manipulated either as a string or by mapping an array onto it. It can be placed back into the GRAPHIC target by GRAPHIC SET BITS.

=====Complementarity of GRAPHIC statements and the Windows GDI API=====
The GRAPHIC statements contain all the commonly used GDI API functions, but if you need one that is not included it is possible to obtain the hDC of any GRAPHIC target and thereby use GDI API functions on it.

==User community==
PowerBASIC provides an online forum for users to ask questions and share knowledge. On 8 July 2012 the forum had 5,623 members (only a fraction of them still active) and contained 50,093 threads comprising 408,642 posts since August 26, 1998. The Source Code section alone contained 3,768 threads.

In early 2024 the main PowerBASIC website was switched to &quot;under construction&quot;. This was heavily discussed in PB forums. The rights owner wrote that the website will not come back.

<doc id="64333" wikidata="Q525787" url="?curid=64333" title="Reed's law">
<text>Reed&#x27;s law is the assertion of David P. Reed that the utility of large , particularly social networks, can scale exponentially with the size of the network.

The reason for this is that the number of possible sub-groups of network participants is 2&quot;N&quot; − &quot;N&quot; − 1, where &quot;N&quot; is the number of participants. This grows much more rapidly than either 
* the number of participants, &quot;N&quot;, or
* the number of possible pair connections, &quot;N&quot;(&quot;N&quot; − 1)/2 (which follows Metcalfe&#x27;s law).
so that even if the utility of groups available to be joined is very small on a per-group basis, eventually the network effect of potential group membership can dominate the overall economics of the system.

==Derivation==
Given a set &quot;A&quot; of &quot;N&quot; people, it has 2&quot;N&quot; possible subsets. This is not difficult to see, since we can form each possible subset by simply choosing for each element of &quot;A&quot; one of two possibilities: whether to include that element, or not.

However, this includes the (one) empty set, and &quot;N&quot; singletons, which are not properly subgroups. So 2&quot;N&quot; − &quot;N&quot; − 1 subsets remain, which is exponential, like 2&quot;N&quot;.

==Quote==
From David P. Reed&#x27;s, &quot;The Law of the Pack&quot; (Harvard Business Review, February 2001, pp 23–4):

:&quot;[E]ven Metcalfe&#x27;s law understates the value created by a group-forming network [GFN] as it grows. Let&#x27;s say you have a GFN with &quot;n&quot; members. If you add up all the potential two-person groups, three-person groups, and so on that those members could form, the number of possible groups equals 2&quot;n&quot;. So the value of a GFN increases exponentially, in proportion to 2&quot;n&quot;. I call that Reed&#x27;s Law. And its implications are profound.&quot;

== Business implications ==
Reed&#x27;s Law is often mentioned when explaining competitive dynamics of internet platforms. As the law states that a network becomes more valuable when people can easily form subgroups to collaborate, while this value increases exponentially with the number of connections, business platform that reaches a sufficient number of members can generate network effects that dominate the overall economics of the system.

==Criticism==

Other analysts of network value functions, including Andrew Odlyzko, have argued that both Reed&#x27;s Law and Metcalfe&#x27;s Law overstate network value because they fail to account for the restrictive impact of human cognitive limits on network formation. According to this argument, the research around Dunbar&#x27;s number implies a limit on the number of inbound and outbound connections a human in a group-forming network can manage, so that the actual maximum-value structure is much sparser than the set-of-subsets measured by Reed&#x27;s law or the complete graph measured by Metcalfe&#x27;s law.

<doc id="64343" wikidata="Q26468" url="?curid=64343" title="Moiré pattern">
<text>In mathematics, physics, and art, moiré patterns ( , , ) or moiré fringes are large-scale interference patterns that can be produced when a partially opaque ruled pattern with transparent gaps is overlaid on another similar pattern. For the moiré interference pattern to appear, the two patterns must not be completely identical, but rather displaced, rotated, or have slightly different pitch.

Moiré patterns appear in many situations. In printing, the printed pattern of dots can interfere with the image. In television and digital photography, a pattern on an object being photographed can interfere with the shape of the light sensors to generate unwanted artifacts. They are also sometimes created deliberately; in micrometers, they are used to amplify the effects of very small movements.

In physics, its manifestation is wave interference like that seen in the double-slit experiment and the beat phenomenon in acoustics.

== Etymology ==
The term originates from &quot;moire&quot; (&quot;moiré&quot; in its French adjectival form), a type of textile, traditionally made of silk but now also made of cotton or synthetic fiber, with a rippled or &quot;watered&quot; appearance. Moire, or &quot;watered textile&quot;, is made by pressing two layers of the textile when wet. The similar but imperfect spacing of the threads creates a characteristic pattern which remains after the fabric dries.

In French, the noun &quot;moire&quot; is in use from the 17th century, for &quot;watered silk&quot;. It was a loan of the English &quot;mohair&quot; (attested 1610). In French usage, the noun gave rise to the verb &quot;moirer&quot;, &quot;to produce a watered textile by weaving or pressing&quot;, by the 18th century. The adjective &quot;moiré&quot; formed from this verb is in use from at least 1823.

== Pattern formation ==


Moiré patterns are often an artifact of images produced by various digital imaging and computer graphics techniques, for example when scanning a halftone picture or ray tracing a checkered plane (the latter being a special case of aliasing, due to undersampling a fine regular pattern). This can be overcome in texture mapping through the use of mipmapping and anisotropic filtering.

The drawing on the upper right shows a moiré pattern. The lines could represent fibers in moiré silk, or lines drawn on paper or on a computer screen. The nonlinear interaction of the optical patterns of lines creates a real and visible pattern of roughly parallel dark and light bands, the moiré pattern, superimposed on the lines.

The moiré effect also occurs between overlapping transparent objects. For example, an invisible phase mask is made of a transparent polymer with a wavy thickness profile. As light shines through two overlaid masks of similar phase patterns, a broad moiré pattern occurs on a screen some distance away. This phase moiré effect and the classical moiré effect from opaque lines are two ends of a continuous spectrum in optics, which is called the universal moiré effect. The phase moiré effect is the basis for a type of broadband interferometer in x-ray and particle wave applications. It also provides a way to reveal hidden patterns in invisible layers.

===Line moiré===
Line moiré is one type of moiré pattern; a pattern that appears when superposing two transparent layers containing correlated opaque patterns. Line moiré is the case when the superposed patterns comprise straight or curved lines. When moving the layer patterns, the moiré patterns transform or move at a faster speed. This effect is called optical moiré speedup.

More complex line moiré patterns are created if the lines are curved or not exactly parallel.

===Shape moiré===
Shape moiré is one type of moiré pattern demonstrating the phenomenon of moiré magnification. 1D shape moiré is the particular simplified case of 2D shape moiré. One-dimensional patterns may appear when superimposing an opaque layer containing tiny horizontal transparent lines on top of a layer containing a complex shape which is periodically repeating along the vertical axis.

Moiré patterns revealing complex shapes, or sequences of symbols embedded in one of the layers (in form of periodically repeated compressed shapes) are created with shape moiré, otherwise called &quot;band moiré&quot; patterns. One of the most important properties of shape moiré is its ability to magnify tiny shapes along either one or both axes, that is, stretching. A common 2D example of moiré magnification occurs when viewing a chain-link fence through a second chain-link fence of identical design. The fine structure of the design is visible even at great distances.

== Calculations ==
=== Moiré of parallel patterns ===

==== Geometrical approach ====
Consider two patterns made of parallel and equidistant lines, e.g., vertical lines. The step of the first pattern is , the step of the second is , with .

If the lines of the patterns are superimposed at the left of the figure, the shift between the lines increases when going to the right. After a given number of lines, the patterns are opposed: the lines of the second pattern are between the lines of the first pattern. If we look from a far distance, we have the feeling of pale zones when the lines are superimposed (there is white between the lines), and of dark zones when the lines are &quot;opposed&quot;.

The middle of the first dark zone is when the shift is equal to . The th line of the second pattern is shifted by compared to the th line of the first network. The middle of the first dark zone thus corresponds to
formula_1
that is
formula_2
The distance between the middle of a pale zone and a dark zone is
formula_3
the distance between the middle of two dark zones, which is also the distance between two pale zones, is
formula_4
From this formula, we can see that:
* the bigger the step, the bigger the distance between the pale and dark zones;
* the bigger the discrepancy , the closer the dark and pale zones; a great spacing between dark and pale zones mean that the patterns have very close steps.

The principle of the moiré is similar to the Vernier scale.

==== Mathematical function approach ====
The essence of the moiré effect is the (mainly visual) perception of a distinctly different third pattern which is caused by inexact superimposition of two similar patterns. The mathematical representation of these patterns is not trivially obtained and can seem somewhat arbitrary. In this section we shall give a mathematical example of two parallel patterns whose superimposition forms a moiré pattern, and show one way (of many possible ways) these patterns and the moiré effect can be rendered mathematically.

The visibility of these patterns is dependent on the medium or substrate in which they appear, and these may be opaque (as for example on paper) or transparent (as for example in plastic film). For purposes of discussion we shall assume the two primary patterns are each printed in greyscale ink on a white sheet, where the opacity (e.g., shade of grey) of the &quot;printed&quot; part is given by a value between 0 (white) and 1 (black) inclusive, with representing neutral grey. Any value less than 0 or greater than 1 using this grey scale is essentially &quot;unprintable&quot;.

We shall also choose to represent the opacity of the pattern resulting from printing one pattern atop the other at a given point on the paper as the average (i.e. the arithmetic mean) of each pattern&#x27;s opacity at that position, which is half their sum, and, as calculated, does not exceed 1. (This choice is not unique. Any other method to combine the functions that satisfies keeping the resultant function value within the bounds [0,1] will also serve; arithmetic averaging has the virtue of simplicity—with hopefully minimal damage to one&#x27;s concepts of the printmaking process.)

We now consider the &quot;printing&quot; superimposition of two almost similar, sinusoidally varying, grey-scale patterns to show how they produce a moiré effect in first printing one pattern on the paper, and then printing the other pattern over the first, keeping their coordinate axes in register. We represent the grey intensity in each pattern by a positive opacity function of distance along a fixed direction (say, the x-coordinate) in the paper plane, in the form

formula_5

where the presence of 1 keeps the function positive definite, and the division by 2 prevents function values greater than 1.

The quantity represents the periodic variation (i.e., spatial frequency) of the pattern&#x27;s grey intensity, measured as the number of intensity cycles per unit distance. Since the sine function is cyclic over argument changes of , the distance increment per intensity cycle (the wavelength) obtains when , or .

Consider now two such patterns, where one has a slightly different periodic variation from the other:

formula_6

such that .

The average of these two functions, representing the superimposed printed image, evaluates as follows (see reverse identities here :Prosthaphaeresis ):

formula_7

where it is easily shown that

formula_8

and

formula_9

This function average, , clearly lies in the range [0,1]. Since the periodic variation is the average of and therefore close to and , the moiré effect is distinctively demonstrated by the sinusoidal envelope &quot;beat&quot; function , whose periodic variation is half the difference of the periodic variations and (and evidently much lower in frequency).

Other one-dimensional moiré effects include the classic beat frequency tone which is heard when two pure notes of almost identical pitch are sounded simultaneously. This is an acoustic version of the moiré effect in the one dimension of time: the original two notes are still present—but the listener&#x27;s &quot;perception&quot; is of two pitches that are the average of and half the difference of the frequencies of the two notes. Aliasing in sampling of time-varying signals also belongs to this moiré paradigm.

=== Rotated patterns ===
Consider two patterns with the same step , but the second pattern is rotated by an angle . Seen from afar, we can also see darker and paler lines: the pale lines correspond to the lines of nodes, that is, lines passing through the intersections of the two patterns.

If we consider a cell of the lattice formed, we can see that it is a rhombus with the four sides equal to ; (we have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is and the side opposite to the angle is ).

The pale lines correspond to the small diagonal of the rhombus. As the diagonals are the bisectors of the neighbouring sides, we can see that the pale line makes an angle equal to with the perpendicular of each pattern&#x27;s line.

Additionally, the spacing between two pale lines is , half of the long diagonal. The long diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle and the sides of the right angle are and . The Pythagorean theorem gives:
formula_10
that is:
formula_11
thus
formula_12

When is very small () the following small-angle approximations can be made:
formula_13
thus
formula_14

We can see that the smaller is, the farther apart the pale lines; when both patterns are parallel (), the spacing between the pale lines is infinite (there is no pale line).

There are thus two ways to determine : by the orientation of the pale lines and by their spacing
formula_15
If we choose to measure the angle, the final error is proportional to the measurement error. If we choose to measure the spacing, the final error is proportional to the inverse of the spacing. Thus, for the small angles, it is best to measure the spacing.

== Implications and applications ==

=== Printing full-color images ===

In graphic arts and prepress, the usual technology for printing full-color images involves the superimposition of halftone screens. These are regular rectangular dot patterns—often four of them, printed in cyan, yellow, magenta, and black. Some kind of moiré pattern is inevitable, but in favorable circumstances the pattern is &quot;tight&quot;; that is, the spatial frequency of the moiré is so high that it is not noticeable. In the graphic arts, the term &quot;moiré&quot; means an &quot;excessively visible&quot; moiré pattern. Part of the prepress art consists of selecting screen angles and halftone frequencies which minimize moiré. The visibility of moiré is not entirely predictable. The same set of screens may produce good results with some images, but visible moiré with others.

=== Television screens and photographs ===

Moiré patterns are commonly seen on television screens when a person is wearing a shirt or jacket of a particular weave or pattern, such as a houndstooth jacket. This is due to interlaced scanning in televisions and non-film cameras, referred to as interline twitter. As the person moves about, the moiré pattern is quite noticeable. Because of this, newscasters and other professionals who regularly appear on TV are instructed to avoid clothing which could cause the effect.

Photographs of a TV screen taken with a digital camera often exhibit moiré patterns. Since both the TV screen and the digital camera use a scanning technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the moiré patterns. To avoid the effect, the digital camera can be aimed at an angle of 30 degrees to the TV screen.

=== Marine navigation ===
The moiré effect is used in shoreside beacons called &quot;Inogon leading marks&quot; or &quot;Inogon lights&quot;, manufactured by Inogon Licens AB, Sweden, to designate the safest path of travel for ships heading to locks, marinas, ports, etc., or to indicate underwater hazards (such as pipelines or cables). The moiré effect creates arrows that point towards an imaginary line marking the hazard or line of safe passage; as navigators pass over the line, the arrows on the beacon appear to become vertical bands before changing back to arrows pointing in the reverse direction. An example can be found in the UK on the eastern shore of Southampton Water, opposite Fawley oil refinery (). Similar moiré effect beacons can be used to guide mariners to the centre point of an oncoming bridge; when the vessel is aligned with the centreline, vertical lines are visible.
Inogon lights are deployed at airports to help pilots on the ground keep to the centreline while docking on stand.

=== Strain measurement ===

In manufacturing industries, these patterns are used for studying microscopic strain in materials: by deforming a grid with respect to a reference grid and measuring the moiré pattern, the stress levels and patterns can be deduced. This technique is attractive because the scale of the moiré pattern is much larger than the deflection that causes it, making measurement easier.

The moiré effect can be used in strain measurement: the operator just has to draw a pattern on the object, and superimpose the reference pattern to the deformed pattern on the deformed object.

A similar effect can be obtained by the superposition of a holographic image of the object to the object itself: the hologram is the reference step, and the difference with the object are the deformations, which appear as pale and dark lines.

=== Image processing ===
Some image scanner computer programs provide an optional filter, called a &quot;descreen&quot; filter, to remove moiré pattern artifacts which would otherwise be produced when scanning printed halftone images to produce digital images.

=== Banknotes ===
Many banknotes exploit the tendency of digital scanners to produce moiré patterns by including fine circular or wavy designs that are likely to exhibit a moiré pattern when scanned and printed.

=== Microscopy ===
In super-resolution microscopy, the moiré pattern can be used to obtain images with a resolution higher than the diffraction limit, using a technique known as structured illumination microscopy.

In scanning tunneling microscopy, moiré fringes appear if surface atomic layers have a different crystal structure than the bulk crystal. This can for example be due to surface reconstruction of the crystal, or when a thin layer of a second crystal is on the surface, e.g. single-layer, double-layer graphene, or Van der Waals heterostructure of graphene and hBN, or bismuth and antimony nanostructures.

In transmission electron microscopy (TEM), translational moiré fringes can be seen as parallel contrast lines formed in phase-contrast TEM imaging by the interference of diffracting crystal lattice planes that are overlapping, and which might have different spacing and/or orientation. Most of the moiré contrast observations reported in the literature are obtained using high-resolution phase contrast imaging in TEM. However, if probe aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging is used, more direct interpretation of the crystal structure in terms of atom types and positions is obtained.

===Materials science and condensed matter physics===
In condensed matter physics, the moiré phenomenon is commonly discussed for two-dimensional materials. The effect occurs when there is mismatch between the lattice parameter or angle of the 2D layer and that of the underlying substrate, or another 2D layer, such as in 2D material heterostructures. The phenomenon is exploited as a means of engineering the electronic structure or optical properties of materials, which some call moiré materials. The often significant changes in electronic properties when twisting two atomic layers and the prospect of electronic applications has led to the name twistronics of this field. A prominent example is in twisted bi-layer graphene, which forms a moiré pattern and at a particular &quot;magic angle&quot; exhibits superconductivity and other important electronic properties.

In materials science, known examples exhibiting moiré contrast are thin films or nanoparticles of MX-type (M = Ti, Nb; X = C, N) overlapping with austenitic matrix. Both phases, MX and the matrix, have face-centered cubic crystal structure and cube-on-cube orientation relationship. However, they have significant lattice misfit of about 20 to 24% (based on the chemical composition of alloy), which produces a moiré effect.

<text>Plainfield is a city in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Nicknamed &quot;The Queen City&quot;, it serves as both a regional hub for Central New Jersey and a bedroom suburb of the New York Metropolitan area, located in the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population, majority Latino for the first time, was 54,586. This was an increase of 4,778 (+9.6%) from the 2010 census count of 49,808, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,979 (+4.1%) from the 47,829 counted in the 2000 census. In 2023, the Census Bureau estimated the city&#x27;s population to be 54,670.

The area of present-day Plainfield was originally formed as Plainfield Township, a township that was created on April 5, 1847, from portions of Westfield Township, while the area was still part of Essex County. On March 19, 1857, Plainfield Township became part of the newly created Union County.

Plainfield was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 21, 1869, from portions of Plainfield Township, based on the results of a referendum held that same day. The city and township coexisted until March 6, 1878, when Plainfield Township was dissolved and parts were absorbed by Plainfield city, with the remainder becoming Fanwood Township (now known as Scotch Plains).

The name &quot;Plainfield&quot;, also used in both North Plainfield and South Plainfield, is derived from a local estate or from its scenic location.

==History==
Plainfield was settled in 1684 by Quakers, and incorporated as a city in 1869. Formerly a bedroom suburb in the New York metropolitan area, it has become the urban center of 10 closely allied municipalities, with diversified industries, including printing and the manufacture of chemicals, clothing, electronic equipment, and vehicular parts. Among the several 18th-century buildings remaining are a Friends&#x27; meetinghouse (1788), the Martine house (1717), and the Nathaniel Drake House (1746), known as George Washington&#x27;s headquarters during the Battle of Short Hills in June 1777. Nearby Washington Rock is a prominent point of the Watchung Mountains and is reputed to be the vantage point from which Washington watched British troop movements.

The &quot;Queen City&quot; moniker arose in the second half of the 19th century. Plainfield had been developing a reputation during this period as featuring a climate that was beneficial for respiratory ailments. In 1886, in an effort to publicize the climate, local newspaper publisher Thomas W. Morrison began to use the slogan &quot;Colorado of the East&quot; to promote Plainfield. As Denver, Colorado, was known as the &quot;Queen City of the Plains,&quot; the slogan for Plainfield eventually became abbreviated to &quot;The Queen City.&quot;

In 1902, the New Jersey Legislature approved measures that would have allowed the borough of North Plainfield to become part of Union County (a measure repealed in 1903) and to allow for a merger of North Plainfield with the City of Plainfield subject to the approval of a referendum by voters in both municipalities.

Plainfield is the birthplace of P-Funk. George Clinton founded The Parliaments while working in a Plainfield barber shop. Parliament-Funkadelic was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Plainfield has been home to former New Jersey governor James McGreevey.

In sports history, Plainfield is the birthplace and/or home of several current and former athletes, including professionals and well-known amateurs. Included in their number are Milt Campbell, the 1956 Olympic Decathlon gold medalist (the first African-American to earn this title), Joe Black, the first African-American pitcher to win a World Series game, Jeff Torborg, former MLB player, coach and manager, former Duke University and Chicago Bull basketball player Jay Williams, and Vic Washington, NFL player.

Plainfield&#x27;s history as a place to call home for the 19th and 20th century wealthy has led to a significant and preserved suburban architectural legacy. An influx of Wall Street money led to the creation of what was called Millionaires&#x27; Row after the opening of the railway in the 19th century.

There are numerous sites, including homes, parks, and districts in the city that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While not listed, the Plainfield Armory, a prominent landmark completed in 1932, was sold by the state in 2013 as surplus property.

Plainfield&#x27;s wealthy northeast corner, known as the &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; section of the city, was and still is characterized by its array of finely landscaped streets and neighborhoods with homes defined by a broad array of architectural styles, most built during the first half of the twentieth century. From the tree-lines neighborhoods, it can be seen that the lot sizes vary, but the stateliness and distinction of each house is evident, whether a stately Queen Anne mansion or gingerbread cottage. Most lots are nicely landscaped and semi or fully private.

Plainfield was affected by the Plainfield Rebellion in July 1967. This civil disturbance occurred in the wake of the larger Newark riots. A Plainfield police officer was killed, about fifty people were injured, and several hundred thousand dollars of property was damaged by looting and arson. The New Jersey National Guard restored order after three days of unrest. This civil unrest caused a massive white flight, characterized by the percentage of Black residents rising from 40% in 1970 to 60% a decade later.

Author and Plainfield native Isaiah Tremaine published &quot;Insurrection&quot; in 2017 as a mournful accounting of the Plainfield riots—and subsequent racial tensions at Plainfield High School—from his perspective as a Black teenager living in the city with both white and Black friends at the time. Prior to the rebellion, Plainfield was a regional shopping and entertainment center. Residents of nearby Union, Middlesex and Somerset counties would drive to shop and explore the business districts of Plainfield. Other than during the holidays, peak shopping times Plainfield were Thursday nights and Saturday, when Front Street and the areas around it bustled.

Plainfield had several entertainment venues at that time. At the peak, there were four operating movie theaters: the Strand, the Liberty, the Paramount and the Oxford theaters.

Manufacturers of heavy goods included Chelsea Fan Corp., Mack Truck and National Starch and Chemical Corp. Plainfield Iron and Metal maintained a large scrapyard in the West End.

==Economy==

Portions of Plainfield are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. The city was selected in 1983 as one of the initial group of 10 zones chosen to participate in the program. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the % rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in January 1986, the city&#x27;s Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in December 2023.

The UEZ program in Plainfield and four other original UEZ cities had been allowed to lapse as of January 1, 2017, after Governor Chris Christie, who called the program an &quot;abject failure&quot;, vetoed a compromise bill that would have extended the status for two years. In May 2018, Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that reinstated the program in these five cities and extended the expiration date in other zones.

Downtown Plainfield has two historic commercial districts: the North Avenue Commercial District and the Plainfield Civic District. Both are on the National Register of Historic Places.

* The North Avenue Commercial District features the Downtown train station, post office, and Plainfield National Bank (now PNC Bank). The architecture of the district reflects original exterior 19th and early 20th century façade architecture.
* The Plainfield Civic District features architecture reflective of the turn-of-the-century City Beautiful Movement, including the City Hall building, YMCA, City Hall Annex, and World War I monument on Watchung Avenue.

Events such as the Christmas Tree Lighting, the Queen City 5k, Fire Safety Fair, and Mayor&#x27;s Wellness Walk take place in the Downtown each year.

Downtown Plainfield Alliance (DPA) is a &quot;nonpolitical, nonprofit grassroots group that supports the improvement of Downtown Plainfield through beautification, volunteerism, economic development, marketing, community development, and activism.&quot;

==Historic districts==

The restoration of large 19th century-era Plainfield estates to their original glory, such as the Craig Marsh home, has been featured in various home design magazine coverage.
Residential districts include:

* Van Wyck Brooks Historic District, which includes more than 150 properties, was listed in This Old House magazine&#x27;s 2012 list of &quot;Best Old House Neighborhoods.&quot; Roughly bounded by Plainfield Avenue, West Eighth Street, Park Avenue, West Ninth Street and Madison Avenue, and Randolph Road, it was named for literary critic and native son Van Wyck Brooks. In addition to the above-mentioned Craig Marsh home, it also contains the largest residence in Plainfield (The Coriell Mansion) and a wide variety of other historically and architecturally notable homes. The Van Wyck Brooks Historic District is the largest of the six residential Historic Districts in Plainfield, its oldest structure the Manning Stelle Farmhouse, parts of which date back to 1803. It has been a designated historic district by the City of Plainfield since 1982, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
* Netherwood Heights Historic District is named for the Netherwood Hotel which stood at what is now the blocks bordered by Denmark Road, Park Terrace, Belvidere Avenue, Berkeley Avenue. This district is located near the Netherwood Train Station
* Crescent Area Historic District
* Hillside Avenue Historic District
*Sleepy Hollow is, as of 2018, a section of stately homes on winding roads on the northeast side of the city. Some have pushed to formalize its boundaries.

==The West End==
While the more affluent eastern part of the city has been relatively integrated over the decades, with both Black and white upper-middle-class-to-wealthy families, the West End of Plainfield is the historically middle-class and working-class Black district in the city and features a close-knit African-American community.

Part of the West End is known to locals as Soulville.

Mount Olive Baptist Church has been serving the West End as a community of faith since 1870. It is considered Plainfield&#x27;s first Black church. As the Black community grew, other congregations branched off from Mount Olive.

Calvary Baptist Church began in 1897 among a group of Black congregants from Mount Olive, and celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2017 with a series of events.

Nearby, Shiloh Baptist Church was founded in 1908, also by Mount Olive congregants, and offers many faith-based events to the community, including its Jazz for Jesus program.

The West End has been eyed recently for redevelopment.

The White Star, a diner in the West End on West Front Street near Green Brook Park, has been an area meeting spot and landmark for over half a century.

The West End has grown more Latino in recent years. As of the 2020 census, 51% of all people living in Plainfield were of Hispanic origin. This was up from 25% in 2000 and 40% in 2010.

In his book &quot;Insurrection&quot;, Isaiah Tremaine, a Black Plainfield native, credits the influx of Latinos for breathing new life and energy into a city hurting from racism and racial strife in the 1970s.

===Parliament-Funkadelic Way===
The West End was once home to the Silk Palace, a barbershop at 216 Plainfield Avenue owned in part by funk music legend George Clinton, staffed by various members of Parliament-Funkadelic, and known as the &quot;hangout for all the local singers and musicians&quot; in Plainfield&#x27;s 1950s and 1960s doo-wop, soul, rock and proto-funk music scene.

In 2022, the city of Plainfield renamed a section of Plainfield Avenue, from its intersection with Front Street to its intersection with West Fifth Street, as &quot;Parliament Funkadelic Way&quot; in honor of its musical history.

==LBGTQ+ community==
A sizable and diverse LGBTQ+ community contributes to the long-time perception of Plainfield as a stronghold of gay life and gay community in the suburbs of New Jersey.

Plainfield has one of the highest percentage of same-sex householders in the state of New Jersey. The First Unitarian Society of Plainfield, the oldest such congregation in the United States, is certified as LGBTQ welcoming.

In 1986, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on what was termed at the time as the &quot;growing homosexual population in Plainfield&quot; drawn to the stock of aging Victorian, Tudor and colonial homes, and featured interviews with various gay men who lived in Plainfield and worked in Manhattan.

One of the Queen City&#x27;s elected leaders, former Councilwoman Rebecca Williams (who now represents all of Union County a county commissioner), is openly lesbian. In 2017, as Council President, Williams organized and hosted the city&#x27;s first-ever Pride flag-raising during Pride Month.

In 2015, an openly gay Plainfield Republican ran for state Assemblyman.

Plainfield has been home to openly gay former New Jersey governor James McGreevey and his longtime partner, an Australian-American business executive.

Plainfield is also at the center of gay life in Union County, which hosts LGBTQ family events and opened the state&#x27;s first county-wide office of LGBTQ services in 2018.

Tëmike Park is an LGBTQ+ welcoming space in Cedar Brook Park in Plainfield between Stelle Avenue and Randolph Road. It is named for a Lenape-language expression of welcome.

<doc id="64371" wikidata="Q255828" url="?curid=64371" title="Pieter Brueghel the Younger">
<text>Pieter Brueghel (also Bruegel or Breughel) the Younger ( , ; ; between 23 May and 10 October 1564 – between March and May 1638) was a Flemish painter known for numerous copies after his father Pieter Bruegel the Elder&#x27;s work, as well as original compositions and Bruegelian pastiches. The large output of his studio (some 1,400 pictures exist with plausible links to Brueghel and his shop), which produced for the local and export market, contributed to the international spread of his father&#x27;s imagery.

Traditionally Pieter Brueghel the Younger has been nicknamed &quot;de helse Brueghel&quot; or &quot;Hellish Brueghel&quot; because it was believed he was the author of several paintings with fantastic depictions of fire and grotesque imagery. These paintings have now been attributed to his brother Jan Brueghel the Elder.

==Life==
Pieter Brueghel the Younger was born in Brussels, the oldest son of the famous sixteenth-century Netherlandish painter Pieter Brueghel the Elder (known as &quot;Peasant Brueghel&quot;) and Mayken Coecke van Aelst. His father died in 1569, when Pieter the younger was only five years old. Following the death of his mother in 1578, Pieter, together with his brother Jan Brueghel the Elder (also referred to as &quot;Velvet Brueghel&quot;, &quot;Paradise Breughel&quot; and &quot;Flower Breughel&quot;) and sister Marie, were raised by their grandmother Mayken Verhulst in a property in the centre of Brussels that was owned by her family. Mayken Verhulst was the widow of the prolific artist Pieter Coecke van Aelst and an accomplished artist in her own right, known for her miniature paintings. According to the biographer and art theorist Karel van Mander, who published a &#x27;Life&#x27; of Pieter Bruegel the Elder in his 1604 &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot; (&quot;Painter Book&quot;), Mayken Verhulst provided her grandson Jan with artistic training; and, on that basis, it is eminently reasonable to propose that Pieter also received an initial artistic instruction from his maternal grandmother.
Early in 1583, Pieter moved to Antwerp, soon followed by his grandmother and brother Jan. Pieter seems to have entered the studio of the landscape painter Gillis van Coninxloo (1544–1607), who was related to the Brueghel family through marriage – the register (&quot;liggeren&quot;) of Antwerp&#x27;s painters&#x27; Guild of St Luke for 1585–86 lists Gillis followed immediately by &#x27;Peeter, his cousin and apprentice&#x27; (&quot;&#x27;Peeter, syn cosyn ends cnecht&quot;&#x27;). His teacher left Antwerp in 1585 and in the 1584/1585 registers of the Guild of Saint Luke, &quot;Peeter Brugel&quot; is listed as an independent master, enlisting as a &#x27;free master&#x27;s son&#x27; (&quot;vrymeestersson&quot;).

It is not known exactly when Brueghel established his own independent studio following his Guild matriculation – his first surviving dated painting comes from several years later, in 1593. It is however known that from 1589 he was established in a house in Antwerp located on the Bogaardestraat, near to the junction with Sint-Antoniusstraat. The house, which he rented, was located in a poorer part of town, nestled amongst small shopkeepers&#x27; houses and at least one brothel, and comprised a front and rear building containing a large studio where Brueghel could work, store materials and, presumably, finished works. He lived at the property with his wife Elisabeth Goddelet, whom he married in 1588 and with whom he had seven children between 1589 and 1597, many of whom died young. One son called Pieter Brueghel III was also a painter. The family lived at this property until at least May 1609, before relocating, at some point before 1616, to the more affluent area on the Brabantse Korenmarkt behind the Tapestry Hall.

Nine formal apprentices, including Frans Snyders and Andries Daniels, passed through Brueghel&#x27;s workshop between 1588 and 1626/27. Many other artists must have found work in his studio as &#x27;journeymen&#x27; – peripetetic jobbing artists hired by day or by contract without need of Guild registration. With an average of one or two formal apprentices every few years, and perhaps several journeymen at any one time, Brueghel thus had a relatively large workforce at his disposal to assist with his prodigious output.

The precise date of Brueghel&#x27;s death is not known. His name appears in the register of Antwerp&#x27;s Guild of St. Luke in a section recording funerary debts for the year 1638, indicating that he died during the Guild year 1637–38.

==Work==
===General===
Pieter Brueghel the Younger painted landscapes, religious subjects, proverbs, and village scenes. A few flower still-life paintings by Pieter have been recorded. His genre paintings of peasants emphasize the picturesque and are regarded by some as lacking Pieter the Elder&#x27;s subtlety and humanism.

He and his workshop were prolific copyists of Pieter Bruegel the Elder&#x27;s most famous compositions. His name and work were largely forgotten in the 18th and 19th centuries until he was rediscovered in the first half of the 20th century.

===Original works===
Pieter Brueghel the Younger created original works largely in the idiom of his father which are energetic, bold and bright and adapted to the 17th-century style. One of the artist&#x27;s most successful original designs was the painting of &quot;The Village Lawyer&quot; (sometimes also called the &quot;Tax Collector&#x27;s Office&quot;, the &quot;Payment of the Tithe&quot;, the &quot;Lawyer of Bad Cases&quot; and the &quot;Notary&#x27;s Office&quot;). The different titles of the work indicate that it may have been interpreted in these different ways in the 17th century. The title &quot;The Village Lawyer&quot; is probably the best suited since the person behind the desk is wearing a lawyer&#x27;s bonnet, the collection of taxes usually did not occur in such setting and the paperwork and bags on the desk look like those for requests and decrees. The picture also shows peasants lining up with presents such as chickens and eggs to please the lawyer, which was a common occurrence, whereas tithe payments were made in grain. The painting shows his interest in and close observation of village life. Pieter Brueghel the Younger&#x27;s workshop made many copies of the composition in different formats. There exist 19 signed and dated versions of this work (from between 1615 and 1622) out of some 25 originals and 35 questionable versions.

Another original composition of Pieter Brueghel the Younger is the &quot;Whitsun Bride&quot;, which is known in at least five autograph versions. One of the copies was formerly held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The picture depicts a Flemish springtime custom of choosing and crowning a queen at Whitsuntide. The festival is focused around a flower gathered in the fields by children. This painting distinguishes itself in style and colour clearly from his father&#x27;s work. The painting uses bright colours, with much vermilion and a rich blue-green in the figures and blue for the sky. The colours display a unity of tone distinctive of the 17th century. The picture also displays a unity in drawing and composition. Another original composition by Pieter Brueghel the Younger are four small tondos representing the &quot;Four Stages of the River&quot; (all at the National Gallery in Prague). As his style never evolved from the manner of his early career it is difficult to date his work.
In several cases, it is not clear whether a composition is an original composition by Pieter Brueghel the Younger or a copy after a lost work by his father.

===Copyist===
Apart from these paintings of his own invention, Pieter Brueghel the Younger also copied the famous compositions of his father through a technique called pouncing. This large scale activity was only possible thanks to his large, well-organized workshop. Comparison of some copies with the originals reveals differences, both in terms of colour as well as the omission or addition of certain details. This may indicate that the copyist re-drafted some sections, or possibly based the copies on prints after original works, rather than on the originals themselves. Pieter the Younger frequently made paintings out of his father&#x27;s figural designs, including drawings for prints.

As Pieter Brueghel the Younger did not always have access to the original paintings of his father he would in fact often rely on prints of his father&#x27;s work to create his derived compositions. He also had access to (now lost) compositional drawings and intermediary cartoons which his father had made and then transferred to panels using pouncing. His work is often the only source of knowledge about works of his father that are lost. One example of just such a work is the &quot;Two Peasants Binding Firewood,&quot; of which several autograph versions exist (Barber Institute of Fine Arts; Private Collection), alongside various studio productions and even copies made outside the Brueghel workshop, which seems to preserve a now-lost original composition by the Elder Bruegel.

The subjects of the copied works cover the entire range of themes and works by Pieter the Elder, including specific religious compositions on both the grand and the small scale. The principal subjects are proverb and peasant scenes of his father.

The most frequently copied work of his father was the &quot;Winter Landscape with Skaters and a Bird-trap&quot;. This work was reproduced by Pieter Brueghel the Younger and his workshop at least 60 times. Of these copies 10 are signed and 4 are dated (1601, 1603, 1616 and 1626). The next most popular work of Pieter the Elder was the &quot;Adoration of the Magi in the Snow&quot; of which Pieter Brueghel the Younger and his workshop produced about 30 copies.

The workshop also produced no less than 25 copies of Pieter Brueghel the Elder&#x27;s &quot;St John the Baptist Preaching&quot;, the original of which is widely believed to be the picture dated 1566, in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. Some of the copies are held in the collections of museums such as the Hermitage, the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp, the National Museum in Kraków, the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Bonn, the Stedelijk Museum Wuyts-Van Campen en Baron Caroly in Lier and the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Valenciennes. Some of the copies are signed and dated. The quality and the large number of versions produced by Brueghel the Younger suggest that he had first-hand knowledge of his father&#x27;s original. Scholars have contended that Brueghel the Elder&#x27;s original picture offered a coded comment on the religious debates that raged in the Low Countries during the 1560s and that it represented a clandestine sermon as held by the Protestant reformers of that time.

Pieter the Younger changed some details of his father&#x27;s original composition. For instance, some versions omit an unidentified figure of a bearded man in black, who is turned towards the spectator. The omission appears to confirm speculation that his prominent presence in the original composition was not accidental. The distinctive face of this figure suggests that it may be a portrait, possibly of the artist himself or the patron who commissioned the painting. The figure of Christ has often been identified either as the man in grey behind the left arm of the Baptist or the bearded man further to the left with his arms crossed. The continued popularity of the picture a generation after Pieter Brueghel the Elder&#x27;s death when the subject had not only lost its political implications but ran contrary to the religious current of the time, shows there was a more aesthetic appreciation of the subject. The composition was then likely enjoyed more for its representation of humanity in all its diversity of race, class, temperament and attitude.


The large-scale production of copies of his father&#x27;s oeuvre demonstrates that there was a significant demand for Pieter the Elder&#x27;s work. At the same time the copies contributed to the popularisation of Pieter the Elder&#x27;s idiom. Without the son&#x27;s copying work the public would not have had access to his father&#x27;s work, which was mainly held in elite private collections, such as the imperial collection of Rudolf II in Prague or the Farnese collection in Parma. At the same time Pieter the Younger extended his father&#x27;s repertoire through his own inventions and variations on themes by his father.

<text>Jacqueline Lee Kennedy Onassis ( ; July 28, 1929 – May 19, 1994) was an American writer, book editor, and socialite who served as the first lady of the United States from 1961 to 1963, as the wife of President John F. Kennedy. A popular first lady, she endeared herself to the American public with her devotion to her family, dedication to the historic preservation of the White House, the campaigns she led to preserve and restore historic landmarks and architecture along with her interest in American history, culture, and arts. During her lifetime, she was regarded as an international icon for her unique fashion choices, and her work as a cultural ambassador of the United States made her very popular globally.

After studying history and art at Vassar College and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in French literature from George Washington University in 1951, Bouvier started working for the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot; as an inquiring photographer. The following year, she met then-Congressman John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts at a dinner party in Washington. He was elected to the Senate that same year, and the couple married on September 12, 1953, in Newport, Rhode Island. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy. Following her husband&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1960, Kennedy was known for her highly publicized restoration of the White House and emphasis on arts and culture as well as for her style. She also traveled to many countries where her fluency in foreign languages and history made her very popular. At age 33, she was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Woman of the Year in 1962.

After her husband&#x27;s assassination and funeral in 1963, Kennedy and her children largely withdrew from public view. In 1968, she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, which caused controversy. Following Onassis&#x27;s death in 1975, she had a career as a book editor in New York City, first at Viking Press and then at Doubleday, and worked to restore her public image. Even after her death, she ranks as one of the most popular and recognizable first ladies in American history, and in 1999, she was placed on the list of Gallup&#x27;s Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century. She died in 1994 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery alongside President Kennedy and two of their children, one stillborn and one who died shortly after birth. Surveys of historians conducted periodically by the Siena College Research Institute since 1982 have consistently found Kennedy Onassis to rank among the most highly regarded first ladies.

== Early life (1929–1951) ==

===Family and childhood===
Jacqueline Lee Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, New York, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou &quot;Black Jack&quot; Bouvier III and socialite Janet Norton Lee. Her mother was of Irish descent, and her father had French, Scottish, and English ancestry. Named after her father, she was baptized at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan and raised in the Roman Catholic faith. Caroline Lee, her younger sister, was born four years later on March 3, 1933.

Jacqueline Bouvier spent her early childhood years in Manhattan and at Lasata, the Bouviers&#x27; country estate in East Hampton on Long Island. She looked up to her father, who likewise favored her over her sister, calling his elder child &quot;the most beautiful daughter a man ever had&quot;. Biographer Tina Santi Flaherty reports Jacqueline&#x27;s early confidence in herself, seeing a link to her father&#x27;s praise and positive attitude to her, and her sister Lee Radziwill stated that Jacqueline would not have gained her &quot;independence and individuality&quot; had it not been for the relationship she had with their father and paternal grandfather, John Vernou Bouvier Jr. From an early age, Jacqueline was an enthusiastic equestrienne and successfully competed in the sport, and horse-riding remained a lifelong passion. She took ballet lessons, was an avid reader, and excelled at learning foreign languages, including French, Spanish, and Italian. French was particularly emphasized in her upbringing.
In 1935, Jacqueline Bouvier was enrolled in Manhattan&#x27;s Chapin School, where she attended grades 1–7. She was a bright student but often misbehaved; one of her teachers described her as &quot;a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil&quot;. Her mother attributed this behavior to her finishing her assignments ahead of classmates and then acting out in boredom. Her behavior improved after the headmistress warned her that none of her positive qualities would matter if she did not behave.

The marriage of the Bouviers was strained by the father&#x27;s alcoholism and extramarital affairs; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split. According to her cousin John H. Davis, Jacqueline was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a &quot;tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own.&quot; When their mother married stockbroker and lawyer Hugh D. Auchincloss Jr., the Bouvier sisters did not attend the ceremony because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to World War II. They gained three stepsiblings from Auchincloss&#x27;s previous marriages, Hugh &quot;Yusha&quot; Auchincloss III, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and Nina Gore Auchincloss. Jacqueline formed the closest bond with Yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants. The marriage later produced two more children, Janet Jennings Auchincloss in 1945 and James Lee Auchincloss in 1947.

As a wedding gift, Mr. Auchincloss presented his new wife, Janet, with a car. But, being in the depths of World War II, no new cars were being produced. So, Mr. Auchincloss gave her a like-new 1940 Ford Deluxe Convertible. Jacqueline, 13 at the time, learned to drive in this 1940 Ford. She continued using the car with her siblings through the 1940s. Shortly before her graduation from George Washington University in 1951, the Auchincloss family sold the Ford. The car now resides in the Crumpley Family Collection in Texas. 

After the remarriage, Auchincloss&#x27;s Merrywood estate in McLean, Virginia, became the Bouvier sisters&#x27; primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, and in their father&#x27;s homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Jacqueline Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she otherwise would have never experienced. While adjusting to her mother&#x27;s remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.

After seven years at Chapin, Jacqueline Bouvier attended the Holton-Arms School in Northwest Washington, D.C., from 1942 to 1944 and Miss Porter&#x27;s School in Farmington, Connecticut, from 1944 to 1947. She chose Miss Porter&#x27;s because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the Auchinclosses and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes. In her senior class yearbook, Bouvier was acknowledged for &quot;her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife&quot;. She later hired her childhood friend Nancy Tuckerman to be her social secretary at the White House. She graduated among the top students of her class and received the Maria McKinney Memorial Award for Excellence in Literature.

=== College and early career ===
In the fall of 1947, Jacqueline Bouvier entered Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, at that time a women&#x27;s institution. She had wanted to attend Sarah Lawrence College, closer to New York City, but her parents insisted that she choose the more isolated Vassar. She was an accomplished student who participated in the school&#x27;s art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper. Due to her dislike of Vassar&#x27;s location in Poughkeepsie, she did not take an active part in its social life and instead traveled back to Manhattan for the weekends. She had made her debut to high society in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in New York social functions. Hearst columnist Igor Cassini dubbed her the &quot;debutante of the year&quot;. She spent her junior year (1949–1950) in France—at the University of Grenoble in Grenoble, and at the Sorbonne in Paris—in a study-abroad program through Smith College. Upon returning home, she transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature in 1951. During the early years of her marriage to John F. Kennedy, she took continuing education classes in American history at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

While attending George Washington, Jacqueline Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine; she had been selected over several hundred other women nationwide. The position entailed working for six months in the magazine&#x27;s New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris. Before beginning the job, she celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee&#x27;s high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer. The trip was the subject of her only autobiography, &quot;One Special Summer&quot;, co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline Bouvier&#x27;s drawings. On her first day at &quot;Vogue&quot;, the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara Leaming, the editor was concerned about Bouvier&#x27;s marriage prospects; she was 22 years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. She followed the advice, left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.

Bouvier moved back to Merrywood and was referred by a family friend to the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot;, where editor Frank Waldrop hired her as a part-time receptionist. A week later she requested more challenging work, and Waldrop sent her to city editor Sidney Epstein, who hired her as an &quot;Inquiring Camera Girl&quot; despite her inexperience, paying her $25 a week. He recalled, &quot;I remember her as this very attractive, cute-as-hell girl, and all the guys in the newsroom giving her a good look.&quot; The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. In addition to the random &quot;man on the street&quot; vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest, such as six-year-old Tricia Nixon. Bouvier interviewed Tricia a few days after her father Richard Nixon was elected to the vice presidency in the 1952 election. During this time, Bouvier was briefly engaged to a young stockbroker named John Husted. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in January 1952. After three months, she called off the engagement because she had found him &quot;immature and boring&quot; once she got to know him better.

== Marriage to John F. Kennedy ==

Jacqueline and U.S. Representative John F. Kennedy met at a dinner party hosted by journalist Charles L. Bartlett in May 1952. She was attracted to Kennedy&#x27;s physical appearance, wit and wealth. The pair also shared the similarities of Catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad. Kennedy was busy running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts; the relationship grew more serious and he proposed to her after the November election. Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been assigned to cover the coronation of Elizabeth II in London for &quot;The Washington Times-Herald&quot;.

After a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy&#x27;s marriage proposal. She then resigned from her position at the newspaper. Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953. She was 24 and he was 36.
Bouvier and Kennedy married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Newport, Rhode Island, in a Mass celebrated by Boston&#x27;s Archbishop Richard Cushing. The wedding was considered the social event of the season with an estimated 700 guests at the ceremony and 1,200 at the reception that followed at Hammersmith Farm. The wedding dress was designed by Ann Lowe of New York City, and is now housed in the Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston. The dresses of her attendants were also created by Lowe, who was not credited by Jacqueline Kennedy.

The newlyweds honeymooned in Acapulco, Mexico, before settling in their new home, Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Kennedy developed a warm relationship with her parents-in-law, Joseph and Rose Kennedy. In the early years of their marriage, the couple faced several personal setbacks. John Kennedy suffered from Addison&#x27;s disease and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain, which had been exacerbated by a war injury; in late 1954, he underwent a near-fatal spinal operation. Additionally, Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and in August 1956 gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Arabella. They subsequently sold their Hickory Hill estate to Kennedy&#x27;s brother Robert, who occupied it with his wife Ethel and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on N Street in Georgetown. The Kennedys also resided at an apartment at 122 Bowdoin Street in Boston, their permanent Massachusetts residence during John&#x27;s congressional career.

Kennedy gave birth to daughter Caroline on November 27, 1957. At the time, she and her husband were campaigning across Massachusetts for his re-election to the Senate, and they posed with their infant daughter for the cover of the April 21, 1958, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. They traveled together during the campaign as part of their efforts to reduce the physical separation that had characterized the first five years of their marriage. Soon enough, John Kennedy started to notice the value his wife added to his congressional campaign. Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell remembered &quot;the size of the crowd was twice as big&quot; when she accompanied her husband; he also recalled her as &quot;always cheerful and obliging&quot;. John&#x27;s mother Rose, however, observed that Jacqueline was not &quot;a natural-born campaigner&quot; due to her shyness and was uncomfortable with too much attention. In November 1958, John was reelected to a second term. He credited Jacqueline&#x27;s visibility in the ads and stumping as vital assets in securing his victory and called her &quot;simply invaluable&quot;.

In July 1959, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. visited the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts and had his first conversation with Jacqueline Kennedy; he found her to have &quot;tremendous awareness, an all-seeing eye and a ruthless judgment&quot;. That year, John Kennedy traveled to 14 states, but Jacqueline took long breaks from the trips to spend time with their daughter, Caroline. She also counseled her husband on improving his wardrobe in preparation for the presidential campaign planned for the following year. In particular, she traveled to Louisiana to visit Edmund Reggie and to help her husband garner support in the state for his presidential bid.

=== Campaign for presidency ===

On January 2, 1960, John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, announced his candidacy for the presidency at the Russell Senate Office Building, and launched his campaign nationwide. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline Kennedy accompanied her husband to campaign events such as whistle-stops and dinners. Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant. Due to her previous high-risk pregnancies, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown. Jacqueline subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, &quot;Campaign Wife&quot;, answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.

Despite her non-participation in the campaign, Kennedy became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices. On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women&#x27;s magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the 12 best-dressed women in the world. On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press. In order to downplay her wealthy background, Kennedy stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.

On July 13, at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, the party nominated John F. Kennedy for president. Jacqueline did not attend the nomination due to her pregnancy, which had been publicly announced ten days earlier. She was in Hyannis Port when she watched the September 26, 1960 debate—which was the nation&#x27;s first televised presidential debate—between her husband and Republican candidate Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. Marian Cannon, the wife of Arthur Schlesinger, watched the debate with her. Days after the debates, Jacqueline Kennedy contacted Schlesinger and informed him that John wanted his aid along with that of John Kenneth Galbraith in preparing for the third debate on October 13; she wished for them to give her husband new ideas and speeches. On September 29, 1960, the Kennedys appeared together for a joint interview on &quot;Person to Person&quot;, interviewed by Charles Collingwood.

=== As first lady ===
On November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon in the U.S. presidential election. A little over two weeks later on November 25, Jacqueline Kennedy gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first son, John F. Kennedy Jr. She spent two weeks recuperating in the hospital, during which the most minute details of both her and her son&#x27;s conditions were reported by the media in what has been considered the first instance of national interest in the Kennedy family.

Kennedy&#x27;s husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961. At 31, Kennedy was the third youngest woman to serve as first lady, as well as the first Silent Generation first lady. She insisted they also kept a family home away from the public eye and rented Glen Ora at Middleburg. As a presidential couple, the Kennedys differed from the Eisenhowers by their political affiliation, youth, and their relationship with the media. Historian Gil Troy has noted that in particular, they &quot;emphasized vague appearances rather than specific accomplishments or passionate commitments&quot; and therefore fit in well in the early 1960s&#x27; &quot;cool, TV-oriented culture&quot;. The discussion about Kennedy&#x27;s fashion choices continued during her years in the White House, and she became a trendsetter, hiring American designer Oleg Cassini to design her wardrobe. She was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary, Pamela Turnure, and carefully managed her contact with the media, usually shying away from making public statements, and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were photographed. The media portrayed Kennedy as the ideal woman, which led academic Maurine Beasley to observe that she &quot;created an unrealistic media expectation for first ladies that would challenge her successors&quot;. Nevertheless, she attracted worldwide positive public attention and gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its Cold War policies.

Although Kennedy stated that her priority as a first lady was to take care of the President and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of American arts and preservation of its history. The restoration of the White House was her main contribution, but she also furthered the cause by hosting social events that brought together elite figures from politics and the arts. One of her unrealized goals was to found a Department of the Arts, but she did contribute to the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, established during Johnson&#x27;s tenure.

==== White House restoration ====
Kennedy had visited the White House on two occasions before she became first lady: the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of outgoing First Lady Mamie Eisenhower shortly before her husband&#x27;s inauguration. She was dismayed to find that the mansion&#x27;s rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance and made it her first major project as first lady to restore its historical character. On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator Sister Parish. She decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. The $50,000 that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted. Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert Henry du Pont. To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration. Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, Jacqueline Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the Rose Garden and the East Garden, which was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden after her husband&#x27;s assassination. In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation&#x27;s capital and played an essential role in its history. She helped to stop the destruction of historic buildings along the square, including the Renwick Building, now part of the Smithsonian Institution, and her support of historic preservation also reached beyond the United States as she brought international attention to the thirteenth-century B.C. temples of Abu Simbel that were in danger of being flooded by Egypt&#x27;s Aswan Dam.

Prior to Kennedy&#x27;s years as first lady, presidents and their families had taken furnishings and other items from the White House when they departed; this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion. She personally wrote to possible donors in order to track down these missing furnishings and other historical pieces of interest. Jacqueline Kennedy initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the Smithsonian Institution rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own. She also founded the White House Historical Association, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, the position of a permanent Curator of the White House, the White House Endowment Trust, and the White House Acquisition Trust. She was the first presidential spouse to hire a White House curator.

On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline Kennedy, accompanied by Charles Collingwood of CBS News, took American television viewers on a tour of the White House. In the tour, she stated, &quot;I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It&#x27;s so important ... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don&#x27;t realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best.&quot; The film was watched by 56 million television viewers in the United States, and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson. Kennedy was the only first lady to win an Emmy.
==== Foreign trips ====
Jackie Kennedy was a cultural ambassador of the United States known for her cultural and diplomatic work globally and would travel sometimes without President Kennedy to different countries to promote cultural exchange and diplomatic relations. She was highly regarded by foreign dignitaries, as she used her fluency in foreign languages such as French, Spanish, and Italian, as well as her cultural knowledge, to establish strong relationships with foreign leaders and to give speeches. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor, the highest civilian award given by the French government, becoming the initial First Lady and first American woman to be such a recipient. Her role as a cultural ambassador had a significant impact on cultural diplomacy and helped strengthen ties between the United States and other countries.

Jacqueline&#x27;s language skills and cultural knowledge were highly respected by the French people, and her visit to France with President Kennedy in 1961 was seen as a great success. During the visit, she made a speech in French at the American University in Paris, which was widely praised for its eloquence. In her speech, Jacqueline Kennedy spoke about the importance of cultural exchange between France and the United States, and she emphasized the shared values and history of the two nations.

Throughout her husband&#x27;s presidency and more than any of the preceding first ladies, Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President. Despite the initial worry that she might not have &quot;political appeal&quot;, she proved popular among international dignitaries. Before the Kennedys&#x27; first official visit to France in 1961, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history. At the conclusion of the visit, &quot;Time&quot; magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, &quot;There was also that fellow who came with her.&quot; Even President Kennedy joked: &quot;I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris – and I have enjoyed it!&quot;

From France, the Kennedys traveled to Vienna, Austria, where Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was asked to shake the President&#x27;s hand for a photo. He replied, &quot;I&#x27;d like to shake her hand first.&quot; Khrushchev later sent her a puppy, Pushinka; the animal was significant for being the offspring of Strelka, the dog that had gone to space during a Soviet space mission.

At the urging of U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy undertook a tour of India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962. The tour was amply documented in photojournalism as well as in Galbraith&#x27;s journals and memoirs. The president of Pakistan, Ayub Khan, had given her a horse named Sardar as a gift. He had found out on his visit to the White House that he and the First Lady had a common interest in horses. &quot;Life&quot; magazine correspondent Anne Chamberlin wrote that Kennedy &quot;conducted herself magnificently&quot; although noting that her crowds were smaller than those that President Dwight Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II attracted when they had previously visited these countries. In addition to these well-publicized trips during the three years of the Kennedy administration, she traveled to countries including Afghanistan, Austria, Canada, Colombia, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Turkey, and Venezuela. Unlike her husband, Kennedy was fluent in Spanish, which she used to address Latin American audiences.

==== Death of infant son ====

In early 1963, Kennedy was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties. She spent most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented on Squaw Island, which was near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7 (five weeks ahead of her scheduled due date), she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. The infant&#x27;s lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, where he died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth. Kennedy had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son and was present when he died. On August 14, the President returned to Otis to take her home and gave an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen who had gathered in her suite. In appreciation, she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House.

The First Lady was deeply affected by Patrick&#x27;s death and proceeded to enter a state of depression. However, the loss of their child had a positive impact on the marriage and brought the couple closer together in their shared grief. Arthur Schlesinger wrote that while John Kennedy always &quot;regarded Jackie with genuine affection and pride,&quot; their marriage &quot;never seemed more solid than in the later months of 1963&quot;. Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s friend Aristotle Onassis was aware of her depression and invited her to his yacht to recuperate. President Kennedy initially had reservations, but he relented because he believed that it would be &quot;good for her&quot;. The trip was widely disapproved of within the Kennedy administration, by much of the general public, and in Congress. The First Lady returned to the United States on October 17, 1963. She would later say she regretted being away as long as she was but had been &quot;melancholy after the death of my baby&quot;.

== Assassination and funeral of John F. Kennedy ==
On November 21, 1963, the First Lady and the President embarked on a political trip to Texas with several goals in mind. This was the first time that she had joined her husband on such a trip in the U.S. After a breakfast on November 22, they took a very short flight on Air Force One from Fort Worth&#x27;s Carswell Air Force Base to Dallas&#x27;s Love Field, accompanied by Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie. The First Lady was wearing a bright pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat, which had been personally selected by President Kennedy. A motorcade was to take them to the Trade Mart, where the president was scheduled to speak at a lunch. The First Lady was seated to her husband&#x27;s left in the third row of seats in the presidential car, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade.

After the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle backfiring. She did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent Clint Hill later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for something coming off the right rear bumper of the car. Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. As Hill stood on the back bumper, Associated Press photographer Ike Altgens snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world. She would later testify that she saw pictures &quot;of me climbing out the back. But I don&#x27;t remember that at all&quot;.

The President was rushed for the trip to Parkland Hospital. At the First Lady&#x27;s request, she was allowed to be present in the operating room. President Kennedy never regained consciousness.
He died not long after, aged 46. After her husband was pronounced dead, Kennedy refused to remove her blood-stained clothing and reportedly regretted having washed the blood off her face and hands, explaining to Lady Bird Johnson that she wanted &quot;them to see what they have done to Jack&quot;. She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she boarded Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as president. The unlaundered suit became a symbol of her husband&#x27;s assassination, and was donated to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1964. Under the terms of an agreement with her daughter, Caroline, the suit will not be placed on public display before 2103. Johnson&#x27;s biographer Robert Caro wrote that Johnson wanted Jacqueline Kennedy to be present at his swearing-in in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of his presidency to JFK loyalists and to the world at large.

Kennedy took an active role in planning her husband&#x27;s state funeral, modeling it after Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s service. She requested a closed casket, overruling the wishes of her brother-in-law, Robert. The funeral service was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington D.C., with the burial taking place at nearby Arlington National Cemetery. Kennedy led the procession on foot and lit the eternal flame—created at her request—at the gravesite. Lady Jeanne Campbell reported back to the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;: &quot;Jacqueline Kennedy has given the American people ... one thing they have always lacked: Majesty.&quot;

A week after the assassination, new president Lyndon B. Johnson issued an executive order that established the Warren Commission—led by Chief Justice Earl Warren—to investigate the assassination. Ten months later, the Commission issued its report finding that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone when he assassinated President Kennedy. Privately, his widow cared little about the investigation, stating that even if they had the right suspect, it would not bring her husband back. Nevertheless, she gave a deposition to the Warren Commission. Following the assassination and the media coverage that had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Kennedy stepped back from official public view, apart from a brief appearance in Washington to honor the Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.
== Life following the assassination (1963–1975) ==
===Mourning period and later public appearances===
On November 29, 1963—a week after her husband&#x27;s assassination—Kennedy was interviewed in Hyannis Port by Theodore H. White of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. In that session, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to King Arthur&#x27;s mythical Camelot, commenting that the President often played the title song of Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s musical recording before retreating to bed. She also quoted Queen Guinevere from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt. The era of the Kennedy administration has subsequently been referred to as the &quot;Camelot Era&quot;, although historians have later argued that the comparison is not appropriate, with Robert Dallek stating that Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;effort to lionize [her husband] must have provided a therapeutic shield against immobilizing grief.&quot;

Kennedy and her children remained in the White House for two weeks following the assassination. Wanting to &quot;do something nice for Jackie&quot;, President Johnson offered an ambassadorship to France to her, aware of her heritage and fondness for the country&#x27;s culture, but she turned the offer down, as well as follow-up offers of ambassadorships to Mexico and the United Kingdom. At her request, Johnson renamed the Florida space center the John F. Kennedy Space Center a week after the assassination. Kennedy later publicly praised Johnson for his kindness to her.

Kennedy spent 1964 in mourning and made few public appearances. In the winter following the assassination, she and the children stayed at Averell Harriman&#x27;s home in Georgetown. On January 14, 1964, Kennedy made a televised appearance from the office of the Attorney General, thanking the public for the &quot;hundreds of thousands of messages&quot; she had received since the assassination, and said she had been sustained by America&#x27;s affection for her late husband. She purchased a house for herself and her children in Georgetown but sold it later in 1964 and bought a 15th-floor penthouse apartment for $250,000 at 1040 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in the hopes of having more privacy.

In the following years, Kennedy attended selected memorial dedications to her late husband. She also oversaw the establishment of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration. Designed by architect I.M. Pei, it is situated next to the University of Massachusetts campus in Boston.

Despite having commissioned William Manchester&#x27;s authorized account of President Kennedy&#x27;s death, &quot;The Death of a President&quot;, Kennedy was subject to significant media attention in 1966–1967 when she and Robert Kennedy tried to block its publication. They sued publishers Harper &amp; Row in December 1966; the suit was settled the following year when Manchester removed passages that detailed President Kennedy&#x27;s private life.

During the Vietnam War in November 1967, &quot;Life&quot; magazine dubbed Kennedy &quot;America&#x27;s unofficial roving ambassador&quot; when she and David Ormsby-Gore, former British ambassador to the United States during the Kennedy administration, traveled to Cambodia, where they visited the religious complex of Angkor Wat with Chief of State Norodom Sihanouk. According to historian Milton Osborne, her visit was &quot;the start of the repair to Cambodian-US relations, which had been at a very low ebb&quot;. She also attended the funeral services of Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 1968, despite her initial reluctance due to the crowds and reminders of President Kennedy&#x27;s death.

=== Relationship with Robert F. Kennedy ===
After her husband&#x27;s assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy relied heavily on her brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy; she observed him to be the &quot;least like his father&quot; of the Kennedy brothers. He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital. In the aftermath of the assassination, Robert became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as attorney general required him to reduce attention. He credited her with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his 1964 run for United States senator from New York.

The January 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam resulted in a drop in President Johnson&#x27;s poll numbers, and Robert Kennedy&#x27;s advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. When Art Buchwald asked him if he intended to run, Robert replied, &quot;That depends on what Jackie wants me to do&quot;. She met with him around this time and encouraged him to run after she had previously advised him not to follow Jack, but to &quot;be yourself&quot;. Privately, she worried about his safety; she believed that Bobby was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was &quot;so much hatred&quot; in the United States. She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was &quot;fatalistic&quot; like her. Despite her concerns, Jacqueline Kennedy campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him, and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House.

Just after midnight PDT on June 5, 1968, an enraged Jordanian gunman named Sirhan Sirhan mortally wounded Robert Kennedy minutes after he and a crowd of his supporters had been celebrating his victory in the California Democratic presidential primary. Jacqueline Kennedy rushed to Los Angeles to join his wife Ethel, her brother-in-law Ted, and the other Kennedy family members at his bedside in Good Samaritan Hospital. Robert Kennedy never regained consciousness and died the following day. He was 42 years old.

=== Marriage to Aristotle Onassis ===
After Robert Kennedy&#x27;s death in 1968, Kennedy reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband&#x27;s assassination nearly five years prior. She came to fear for her life and those of her two children, saying: &quot;If they&#x27;re killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country.&quot;

On October 20, 1968, Jacqueline Kennedy married her long-time friend Aristotle Onassis, a Greek shipping magnate who was able to provide the privacy and security she sought for herself and her children. The wedding took place on Skorpios, Onassis&#x27;s private Greek island in the Ionian Sea. After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis and consequently lost her right to Secret Service protection, which is an entitlement of a widow of a U.S. president. The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. The fact that Aristotle was divorced and his former wife Athina Livanos was still living led to speculation that Jacqueline might be excommunicated by the Roman Catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by Boston&#x27;s archbishop, Cardinal Richard Cushing, as &quot;nonsense&quot;. She was condemned by some as a &quot;public sinner&quot;, and became the target of paparazzi who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her &quot;Jackie O&quot;.

In 1968, billionaire heiress Doris Duke, with whom Jacqueline Onassis was friends, appointed her as the vice president of the Newport Restoration Foundation. Onassis publicly championed the foundation.

During their marriage, Jacqueline and Aristotle Onassis inhabited six different residences: her 15-room Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan, her horse farm in Peapack-Gladstone, New Jersey, his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht &quot;Christina O&quot;. Onassis ensured that her children continued a connection with the Kennedy family by having Ted Kennedy visit them often. She developed a close relationship with Ted, and from then on he was involved in her public appearances.

Aristotle Onassis&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son Alexander in a plane crash in 1973. He died of respiratory failure aged 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Jacqueline Onassis eventually accepted a settlement of $26 million from Christina Onassis—Aristotle&#x27;s daughter and sole heir—and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.

==Later years (1975–1990s)==
After the death of her second husband, Onassis returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years. 

After almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, Onassis attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors&#x27; gallery. She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 after John Leonard of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that she held some responsibility for Viking&#x27;s publication of the Jeffrey Archer novel &quot;Shall We Tell the President?&quot;, set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and describing an assassination plot against him. Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at Faneuil Hall in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced that he was going to challenge incumbent president Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president. She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.

Following her resignation from Viking Press, Onassis was hired by Doubleday, where she worked as an associate editor under an old friend, John Turner Sargent, Sr. Among the books she edited for the company are Larry Gonick&#x27;s &quot;The Cartoon History of the Universe&quot;, the English translation of the three volumes of Naghib Mahfuz&#x27;s &quot;Cairo Trilogy&quot; (with Martha Levin), and autobiographies of ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and fashion icon Diana Vreeland. She also encouraged Dorothy West, her neighbor on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and one of the last surviving members of the Harlem Renaissance, to complete the novel &quot;The Wedding&quot; (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S. The book was later adapted as a miniseries in 1998, starring Halle Berry and Lynn Whitfield and produced by Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Harpo Productions.

In addition to her work as an editor, Onassis participated in cultural and architectural preservation. In the 1970s, she led a historic preservation campaign to save Grand Central Terminal from demolition and renovate the structure in Manhattan. A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at Columbus Circle that would have cast large shadows on Central Park; the project was canceled. A later project proceeded despite protests: a large twin-towered skyscraper, the Time Warner Center, was completed in 2003. Her historic preservation efforts also include her influence in the campaign to save Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church in upstate New York. She was awarded the Fine Arts Federation medal for her devotion to the cause of historic preservation in New York City.

Onassis remained the subject of considerable press attention, especially from the paparazzi photographer Ron Galella, who followed her around and photographed her as she went about her normal activities; he took candid photos of her without her permission. She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him, and the situation brought attention to the problem of paparazzi photography. From 1980 until her death, Onassis maintained a close relationship with Maurice Tempelsman, a Belgian-born industrialist and diamond merchant who was her companion and personal financial adviser.

In 1988, Onassis became a first-time grandmother when her daughter Caroline – married to designer Edwin Schlossberg – gave birth to daughter Rose, followed by Tatiana Celia (b. 1990) and John Bouvier (b. 1993). Caroline would later recall: &quot;I have never seen her so happy as when she&#x27;s around the kids.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Onassis supported Bill Clinton and contributed money to his presidential campaign. Following the election, she met with First Lady Hillary Clinton and advised her on raising a child in the White House. In her memoir &quot;Living History&quot;, Clinton wrote that Onassis was &quot;a source of inspiration and advice for me&quot;. Democratic consultant Ann Lewis observed that Onassis had reached out to the Clintons &quot;in a way she has not always acted toward leading Democrats in the past&quot;.

== Illness, death, and funeral ==
In November 1993, Onassis was thrown from her horse while participating in a fox hunt in Middleburg, Virginia, and was taken to the hospital to be examined. A swollen lymph node was discovered in her groin, which was initially diagnosed by the doctor to be caused by an infection. The fall from the horse contributed to her deteriorating health over the next six months. In December, Onassis developed new symptoms, including a stomach ache and swollen lymph nodes in her neck, and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. She began chemotherapy in January 1994 and publicly announced the diagnosis, stating that the initial prognosis was good. She continued to work at Doubleday, but by March the cancer had spread to her spinal cord, brain and liver and by May it was deemed terminal. 

Onassis made her last trip home from New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center on May 18, 1994. The following night at 10:15 p.m., she died in her sleep in her Manhattan apartment at age 64, with her children by her side. In the morning, her son, John F. Kennedy Jr., announced his mother&#x27;s death to the press stating that she had been &quot;surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved&quot;. He added that &quot;she did it in her very own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that.&quot;

On May 23, 1994, her funeral Mass was held a few blocks away from her apartment at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola—the Catholic parish where she was baptized in 1929 and confirmed as a teenager—and asked for no cameras to film the event, for privacy. She was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, alongside President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella. President Bill Clinton delivered a eulogy at her graveside service.

She left an estate that its executors valued at million (equivalent to $million in ).

== Legacy ==
=== Popularity ===

Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s marriage to Aristotle Onassis caused her popularity to decline sharply among an American public who viewed it as a betrayal of the assassinated president. Her lavish lifestyle as Onassis&#x27;s &quot;trophy wife&quot;, in contrast to &quot;the shy, selfless, and sacrificing mother the American public had come to respect&quot; as First Lady, led the press to portray her as &quot;a spendthrift and a reckless woman&quot;.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis took conscious control of her public image and, by the time of her death, succeeded in rehabilitating it. By moving back to New York City after Onassis&#x27;s death, working as an editor for Viking Press and Doubleday, focusing on her children and grandchildren, and participating in charitable causes, she reversed her &quot;reckless spendthrift&quot; image. She also reestablished her relationship with the Kennedy family and supported the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum.

Onassis remains one of the most popular First Ladies. She was featured 27 times on the annual Gallup list of the top 10 most admired people of the second half of the 20th century; this number is surpassed by only Billy Graham and Queen Elizabeth II and is higher than that of any U.S. president.

Both Tina Turner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee have cited Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as an influence.

=== Style icon ===

Jacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband&#x27;s presidency. After the 1960 election, she commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend Oleg Cassini to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president.

Kennedy preferred French couture, particularly the work of Chanel, Balenciaga, and Givenchy, but was aware that in her role as first lady, she would be expected to wear American designers&#x27; work. After noticing that her taste for Paris fashion was being criticized in the press, she wrote to the fashion editor Diana Vreeland to ask for suitable American designers, particularly those who could reproduce the Paris look. After considering the letter, which expressed her dislike of prints and her preference for &quot;terribly simple, covered-up clothes,&quot; Vreeland recommended Norman Norell, who was considered America&#x27;s first designer and known for his high-end simplicity and fine quality work. She also suggested Ben Zuckerman, another highly regarded tailor who regularly offered re-interpretations of Paris couture, and the sportswear designer Stella Sloat, who occasionally offered Givenchy copies. Kennedy&#x27;s first choice for her Inauguration Day coat was originally a purple wool Zuckerman model that was based on a Pierre Cardin design, but she instead settled on a fawn Cassini coat and wore the Zuckerman for a tour of the White House with Mamie Eisenhower.

In her role as first lady, Kennedy preferred to wear clean-cut suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless A-line dresses, above-the-elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and pillbox hats. Dubbed the &quot;Jackie&quot; look, these clothing items rapidly became fashion trends in the Western world. More than any other First Lady, her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women. Her influential bouffant hairstyle, described as a &quot;grown-up exaggeration of little girls&#x27; hair,&quot; was created by Mr. Kenneth, who worked for her from 1954 until 1986. Her tastes in eyewear were also influential, the most famous of which were the bespoke pairs designed for her by French designer, François Pinton. The coinage &#x27;Jackie O glasses&#x27; is still used today to refer to this style of oversized, oval-lensed sunglasses.

After leaving the White House, Kennedy underwent a style change. Her new looks consisted of wide-leg pantsuits, silk Hermès headscarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses. She began wearing jeans in public as part of a casualization of her look. 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis acquired a large collection of jewelry throughout her lifetime. Her triple-strand pearl necklace, designed by American jeweler Kenneth Jay Lane, became her signature piece of jewelry during her time as first lady in the White House. Often referred to as the &quot;berry brooch&quot;, the two-fruit cluster brooch of strawberries made of rubies with stems and leaves of diamonds, designed by French jeweler Jean Schlumberger for Tiffany &amp; Co., was personally selected and given to her by her husband several days prior to his inauguration in January 1961. She wore Schlumberger&#x27;s gold and enamel bracelets so frequently in the early and mid-1960s that the press called them &quot;Jackie bracelets&quot;; she also favored his white enamel and gold &quot;banana&quot; earrings. Kennedy wore jewelry designed by Van Cleef &amp; Arpels throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; her sentimental favorite was the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels wedding ring given to her by President Kennedy.

Kennedy, a Catholic, was known for wearing a mantilla at Mass and in the presence of the Pope.

Mary Tyler Moore&#x27;s &quot;Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; character Laura Petrie, who symbolized the &quot;feel-good nature&quot; of the Kennedy White House, often dressed like Kennedy.

Kennedy was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1965. Many of her signature clothes are preserved at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum; pieces from the collection were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2001. Titled &quot;Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years&quot;, the exhibition focused on her time as a first lady.

In 2012, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on its All-TIME 100 Fashion Icons list. In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; included her on the list &quot;10 Fashion Icons and the Trends They Made Famous&quot;.
===Historical assessments===
In 2020, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included her name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was named Woman of the Year 1962 for her efforts in uplifting the American history and art.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is seen as being customary in her role as first lady, though Frank N. Magill argued that her life was validation that &quot;fame and celebrity&quot; changed the way that first ladies are evaluated historically. Hamish Bowles, curator of the &quot;Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years&quot; exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attributed her popularity to a sense of unknown that was felt in her withdrawal from the public which he dubbed &quot;immensely appealing&quot;. After her death, Kelly Barber referred to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as &quot;the most intriguing woman in the world&quot;, furthering that her stature was also due to her affiliation with valuable causes. Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony summarized that the former first lady &quot;became an aspirational figure of that era, one whose privilege might not be easily reached by a majority of Americans but which others could strive to emulate&quot;. Since the late 2000s, Onassis&#x27;s traditional persona has been invoked by commentators when referring to fashionable political spouses. A wide variety of commentators have positively credited the work of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in restoring the White House, including Hugh Sidey, Letitia Baldrige, Laura Bush, Kathleen P. Galop, and Carl Anthony.

Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Onassis has ranked among the three-eight highly regarded first ladies in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Onassis has been ranked:
*8th-best of 42 in 1982
*7th-best of 37 in 1993
*4th-best of 38 in 2003
*3rd-best of 38 in 2008
*3rd-best of 39 in 2014

In the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Onassis was ranked in the top-five of all criteria, ranking the 2nd-highest in background, 4th-highest in intelligence, 2nd-highest in value to the country, 4th-highest in being her &quot;own woman&quot;, 4th-highest in integrity, 5th-highest in her accomplishments, 2nd-highest in courage, 4th-highest in leadership, 1st in public image, and 3rd-highest in her value to the president. In the 2003 survey, Onassis made the top-five in half of the categories, being ranked 1st-highest in background, 5th-highest in intelligence, 4th-highest in courage, 4th-highest in value to the country, and 1st-highest in public image. In the 2014 Siena Research Institute survey, in the rankings of 20th and 21st century American first ladies in additional survey questions, Onassis was ranked 2nd-highest for management of family life, 4th-highest for advancement of women&#x27;s issues, 3rd-greatest as a political asset, 4th-strongest public communicator, and 2nd-highest for creation of a lasting legacy. In the 2014 survey, Onassis and her first husband were also ranked the 6th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

In the 1982 Siena College Research Institute survey, Onassis had been ranked the lowest in the criteria of integrity. In subsequent iterations of the survey, historians&#x27; regard for her integrity markedly improved. The initial disapproving view of her integrity may have been due to sentiments towards her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Historians&#x27; overall opinions towards Onassis as a whole appear to have become more favorable in the subsequent years as she, in her second widowhood, demonstrated her independence with her career in publishing.

== Portrayals ==

Jaclyn Smith portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1981 television film &quot;Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy&quot;, depicting her life until the end of the JFK presidency. The film&#x27;s producer Louis Rudolph stated an interest in creating a &quot;positive portrait of a woman who I thought had been very much maligned,&quot; comments that were interpreted by John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as erasing any chances of critique toward her. Though Smith received praise for her performance, with Marilynn Preston calling her &quot;convincing in an impossible role&quot;, Tom Shales wrote &quot;Jaclyn Smith couldn&#x27;t act her way out of a Gucci bag&quot;.

Blair Brown portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1983 miniseries &quot;Kennedy&quot;, set during the Kennedy presidency. Brown used wigs and makeup to better resemble Kennedy and said through playing the role she gained a different view of the assassination: &quot;I realized that this was a woman witnessing the public execution of her husband.&quot; Jason Bailey praised her performance, while Andrea Mullaney noted her resemblance to Kennedy and general shyness. Brown was nominated for a television BAFTA as Best Actress and a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film.

Marianna Bishop, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Roma Downey portray Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the 1991 miniseries &quot;A Woman Named Jackie&quot;, covering her entire life until the death of Aristotle Onassis. Of being contacted for the role, Downey reflected: &quot;I thought I was a strange choice because I didn&#x27;t think I looked anything like her and I was Irish.&quot; Half of Downey&#x27;s wardrobe was designed by Shelley Komarov and Downey stated that though she had long harbored &quot;great respect and admiration&quot; for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, she was unaware of the troubles in her childhood. Reviewer Rick Kogan praised Downey with doing &quot;a surprisingly fine job in the demanding title role&quot;, while Howard Rosenberg lamented Downey&#x27;s performance failing to &quot;pierce this thick glaze of superficiality&quot;. &quot;Ability&quot; credited the role with raising Downey&#x27;s profile. In 1992, the miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries.

Rhoda Griffis portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1992 film &quot;Love Field&quot;, set shortly before and in the aftermath of JFK&#x27;s assassination. It was Griffis&#x27;s feature film debut. Griffis said she had been told by her orthodontist of her resemblance to Kennedy and was cast as her upon walking into the auditions for the role.

Sally Taylor-Isherwood, Emily VanCamp, and Joanne Whalley portray Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the 2000 television miniseries &quot;Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis&quot;, covering chronologically her entire life. Whalley prepared for the role by listening to recordings of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis&#x27;s voice along with working with a dialect coach; by the end of production, she developed an attachment to her. Laura Fries assessed Whalley as lacking Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis&#x27;s charisma despite being &quot;soulful and regal&quot; in her own right while Ron Wertheimer viewed Whalley as being passive in the role and lamented &quot;the filmmakers render Jackie as Forrest Gump in a pillbox hat, someone who keeps passing close to the center of things without really touching – or being touched by – very much.&quot;

Stephanie Romanov portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2000 film &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, taking place during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Philip French of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted her small role and being out of &quot;the loop&quot; was accurate of women&#x27;s roles in &quot;the early Sixties&quot;. Laura Clifford called Romanov &quot;unconvincing&quot; in the role.

Jill Hennessy portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2001 television film &quot;Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot&quot;. Hennessy prepared for the performance by watching hours of archival footage of Kennedy and cited one of the reasons for her favoring of the miniseries was its distinctiveness in not focusing &quot;strictly on the men or only on Jackie&quot;. Reviewers Anita Gates and Terry Kelleher believed Hennessy brought &quot;elegance&quot; to the role while Steve Oxman panned the performance: &quot;Hennessy simply doesn&#x27;t possess the right natural grace. But this pic has a habit of telling us more that [sic] it shows us, and the actress manages to communicate the most important elements of the story without ever making it especially convincing.&quot;

Jacqueline Bisset portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2003 film &quot;America&#x27;s Prince: The John F. Kennedy Jr. Story&quot;. Bisset said the glasses she used during the film were holdovers from a prior role in &quot;The Greek Tycoon&quot;. Neil Genzlinger thought Bisset &quot;should have known better&quot; in taking on the role while Kristen Tauer wrote Bisset portraying Kennedy as a mother was a &quot;different central light than many proceeding films&quot;.

Jeanne Tripplehorn portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2009 film &quot;Grey Gardens&quot; for a single scene. Tripplehorn said questions she had about Edith Bouvier Beale that she thought would be answered by being a part of the film remained unresolved. Tripplehorn received diverse reactions to her performance while Brian Lowry noted her resemblance to Kennedy and small role.

Katie Holmes portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2011 miniseries &quot;The Kennedys&quot;, set during the Kennedy presidency and its 2017 sequel &quot;The Kennedys: After Camelot&quot;, focusing on her life after 1968. Mary McNamara and Hank Stuever regarded Holmes&#x27;s performance with neutrality in their reviews of &quot;The Kennedys&quot; while Hadley Freeman called her &quot;bloodless&quot; in the role. Holmes stated reprising the role was a &quot;bigger challenge&quot; for having to act through later periods of Kennedy&#x27;s life. When asked of the concurrent &quot;Jackie&quot; film, Holmes said, &quot;I think its [sic] really exciting. It&#x27;s [sic] just is a testament to how amazing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was and how much she meant to our country.&quot; Holmes also stated both should be watched due to covering different periods of Jackie&#x27;s life. In &quot;The Kennedys: After Camelot&quot;, Holmes&#x27;s performance was viewed favorably by Daniel Feinberg and Allison Keane while Kristi Turnquist panned her.

Minka Kelly portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2013 film &quot;The Butler&quot;, giving the film&#x27;s protagonist Cecil one of her husband&#x27;s neckties after his assassination. Kelly said she was intimidated and scared taking on the role. Kelly admitted to having difficulty with perfecting Kennedy&#x27;s voice, going &quot;to sleep listening to her&quot;, and having discomfort with the wool clothing associated with the role.

Ginnifer Goodwin portrays her in the 2013 television film &quot;Killing Kennedy&quot;. Goodwin used intimate photos to better portray Jacqueline Kennedy and was concerned &quot;to do her justice and to play her as accurately as possible without ever doing an impression of her&quot;. Costar Rob Lowe said of seeing Goodwin in the pink Chanel suit, &quot;It made it real. If I were under any illusions about what we were doing, seeing her in that iconic moment was, I would say, sobering.&quot; Tom Carson wrote that Goodwin&#x27;s &quot;trademark vulnerability humanizes Jackie considerably&quot; while Bruce Miller called her a miscast and Robert Lloyd and Brian Lowry panned her performance.

Kim Allen portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2016 film &quot;LBJ&quot;. Ray Bennett noted in his review of the film that Allen was in a non-speaking role.

Natalie Portman portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2016 film &quot;Jackie&quot;, set during the JFK presidency and the immediate aftermath of the assassination. Portman admitted being intimidated taking the role and doing research in preparation for filming. Nigel M. Smith wrote that by portraying Kennedy, Portman was &quot;taking on arguably the biggest challenge of her career&quot;. Manohla Dargis, David Edelstein, and Peter Bradshaw praised her performance. Portman was nominated for Best Actress by Academy Awards, AACTA Awards, AWFJ, AFCA, and BSFC, and won the category by the Online Film Critics Society.

Jodi Balfour portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2017 eighth episode of the second season of Netflix&#x27;s drama series, &quot;The Crown&quot;, titled &quot;Dear Mrs. Kennedy&quot;, set during the June 1961 visit of the Kennedy couple to Buckingham Palace and the immediate reaction to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

<doc id="64384" wikidata="Q43270" url="?curid=64384" title="Pieter Bruegel the Elder">
<text>Pieter Bruegel (also Brueghel or Breughel) the Elder ( , ; ; – 9 September 1569) was among the most significant artists of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, a painter and printmaker, known for his landscapes and peasant scenes (so-called genre painting); he was a pioneer in presenting both types of subject as large paintings.

He was a formative influence on Dutch Golden Age painting and later painting in general in his innovative choices of subject matter, as one of the first generation of artists to grow up when religious subjects had ceased to be the natural subject matter of painting. He also painted no portraits, the other mainstay of Netherlandish art. After his training and travels to Italy, he returned in 1555 to settle in Antwerp, where he worked mainly as a prolific designer of prints for the leading publisher of the day. At the end of the 1550s, he made painting his main medium, and all his famous paintings come from the following period of little more than a decade before his early death in 1569, when he was probably in his early forties.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, Bruegel&#x27;s works have inspired artists in both the literary arts and in cinema. His painting &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot;, now thought only to survive in copies, is the subject of the final lines of the 1938 poem &quot;Musée des Beaux Arts&quot; by W. H. Auden. Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky refers to Bruegel&#x27;s paintings in his films several times, including &quot;Solaris&quot; (1972) and &quot;Mirror&quot; (1975). Director Lars von Trier also uses Bruegel&#x27;s paintings in his film &quot;Melancholia&quot; (2011). In 2011, the film &quot;The Mill and the Cross&quot; was released featuring Bruegel&#x27;s &quot;The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life===
Bruegel&#x27;s birth date is not documented, but inferred from the fact that Bruegel entered the Antwerp painters&#x27; guild in 1551. This usually happened between the ages of twenty and twenty-five, giving a range for his birth between 1525 and 1530. His master, according to Karel van Mander, was the Antwerp painter Pieter Coecke van Aelst.

The two main early sources for Bruegel&#x27;s biography are Lodovico Guicciardini&#x27;s account of the Low Countries (1567) and Karel van Mander&#x27;s 1604 &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;. Guicciardini recorded that Bruegel was born in Breda, but van Mander specified that Bruegel was born in a village (&quot;dorp&quot;) near Breda called &quot;Brueghel&quot;, which does not fit any known place. Nothing at all is known of his family background. Van Mander seems to assume he came from a peasant background, in keeping with the over-emphasis on Bruegel&#x27;s peasant genre scenes given by van Mander and many early art historians and critics.
In contrast, scholars of the last six decades have emphasised the intellectual content of his work, and conclude: &quot;There is, in fact, every reason to think that Pieter Bruegel was a townsman and a highly educated one, on friendly terms with the humanists of his time&quot;, ignoring van Mander&#x27;s &quot;dorp&quot; and just placing his childhood in Breda itself. Breda was already a significant centre as the base of the House of Orange-Nassau, with a population of some 8,000, although 90% of its 1300 houses were destroyed in a fire in 1534. This reversal can be taken to excess; although Bruegel moved in highly educated humanist circles, it seems &quot;he had not mastered Latin&quot;, and had others add the Latin captions in some of his drawings.

Between 1545 and 1550 he was a pupil of Pieter Coecke, who died on 6 December 1550. Before this, Bruegel was already working in Mechelen, where he is documented between September 1550 and October 1551 assisting Peeter Baltens on an altarpiece (now lost), painting the wings in &quot;grisaille&quot;. Bruegel possibly got this work via the connections of Mayken Verhulst, the wife of Pieter Coecke. Mayken&#x27;s father and eight siblings were all artists or married artists, and lived in Mechelen.

===Travel===
In 1551 Bruegel became a free master in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp. He set off for Italy soon after, probably by way of France. He visited Rome and, rather adventurously for the period, by 1552 had reached Reggio Calabria at the southern tip of the mainland, where a drawing records the city in flames after a Turkish raid. He probably continued to Sicily, but by 1553 was back in Rome. There he met the miniaturist Giulio Clovio, whose will of 1578 lists paintings by Bruegel; in one case a joint work. These works, apparently landscapes, have not survived, but marginal miniatures in manuscripts by Clovio are attributed to Bruegel.
He left Italy by 1554, and had reached Antwerp by 1555, when the set of prints to his designs known as the &quot;Large Landscapes&quot; were published by Hieronymus Cock, the most important print publisher of northern Europe. Bruegel&#x27;s return route is uncertain, but much of the debate over it was made irrelevant in the 1980s when it was realised that the celebrated series of large drawings of mountain landscapes thought to have been made on the trip were not by Bruegel at all. All the drawings from the trip that are considered authentic are of landscapes; unlike most other 16th-century artists visiting Rome he seems to have ignored both classical ruins and contemporary buildings.

===Antwerp and Brussels===
From 1555 until 1563, Bruegel lived in Antwerp, then the publishing centre of northern Europe, mainly working as a designer of over forty prints for Cock, though his dated paintings begin in 1557. With one exception, Bruegel did not work the plates himself, but produced a drawing which Cock&#x27;s specialists worked from. From 1559, he dropped the &#x27;h&#x27; from his name and signed his paintings as &quot;Bruegel&quot;; his relatives continued to use &quot;Brueghel&quot; or &quot;Breughel&quot;. He moved in the lively humanist circles of the city, and his change of name (or at least its spelling) in 1559 can be seen as an attempt to Latinise it; at the same time he changed the script he signed in from the Gothic blackletter to Roman capitals.

In 1563, he married Pieter Coecke van Aelst&#x27;s daughter Mayken Coecke in Brussels, where he lived for the remainder of his short life. Antwerp was the capital of Netherlandish commerce and the art market; Brussels was the centre of government. Van Mander tells a story that his mother-in-law pushed for the move to distance him from his established servant girl mistress. By now painting had become his main activity, and his most famous works come from these years. His paintings were much sought after, with patrons including wealthy Flemish collectors and Cardinal Granvelle, in effect the Habsburg chief minister, who was based in Mechelen. Bruegel had two sons, both well known as painters, and a daughter about whom nothing is known. These were Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564–1638) and Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568–1625); he died too early to train either of them. He died in Brussels on 9 September 1569 and was buried in the Kapellekerk.

Van Mander records that before he died he told his wife to burn some drawings, perhaps designs for prints, carrying inscriptions &quot;which were too sharp or sarcastic ... either out of remorse or for fear that she might come to harm or in some way be held responsible for them&quot;, which has led to much speculation that they were politically or doctrinally provocative, in a climate of sharp tension in these areas.

==Historical background==
Bruegel was born at a time of extensive change in Western Europe. Humanist ideals from the previous century influenced artists and scholars. Italy was at the end of its High Renaissance of arts and culture, when artists such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci painted their masterpieces. In 1517, about eight years before Bruegel&#x27;s birth, Martin Luther created his &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; and began the Protestant Reformation in neighbouring Germany. Reformation was accompanied by iconoclasm and widespread destruction of art, including in the Low Countries. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and its destructive iconoclasm of art as a threat to the Church. The Council of Trent, which concluded in 1563, determined that religious art should be more focused on religious subject-matter and less on material things and decorative qualities.

At this time, the Low Countries were divided into Seventeen Provinces, some of which wanted separation from the Habsburg rule based in Spain. The Reformation meanwhile produced a number of Protestant denominations that gained followers in the Seventeen Provinces, influenced by the newly Lutheran German states to the east and the newly Anglican England to the west. The Habsburg monarchs of Spain attempted a policy of strict religious uniformity for the Catholic Church within their domains and enforced it with the Inquisition. Increasing religious antagonisms and riots, political manoeuvrings, and executions eventually resulted in the outbreak of the Eighty Years&#x27; War.

In this atmosphere Bruegel reached the height of his career as a painter. Two years before his death, the Eighty Years&#x27; War began between the United Provinces and Spain. Although Bruegel did not live to see it, seven provinces became independent and formed the Dutch Republic, while the other ten remained under Habsburg control at the end of the war.

==Subjects==
===Peasants===


Pieter Bruegel specialised in genre paintings populated by peasants, often with a landscape element, though he also painted religious works. Making the life and manners of peasants the main focus of a work was rare in painting in Bruegel&#x27;s time, and he was a pioneer of the genre painting. Many of his peasant paintings fall into two groups in terms of scale and composition, both of which were original and influential on later painting. His earlier style shows dozens of small figures, seen from a high viewpoint, and spread fairly evenly across the central picture space. The setting is typically an urban space surrounded by buildings, within which the figures have a &quot;fundamentally disconnected manner of portrayal&quot;, with individuals or small groups engaged in their own distinct activity, while ignoring all the others.

His earthy, unsentimental but vivid depiction of the rituals of village life—including agriculture, hunts, meals, festivals, dances, and games—are unique windows on a vanished folk culture, though still characteristic of Belgian life and culture today, and a prime source of iconographic evidence about both physical and social aspects of 16th-century life. For example, his famous painting &quot;Netherlandish Proverbs&quot;, originally &quot;The Blue Cloak&quot;, illustrates dozens of then-contemporary aphorisms, many of which still are in use in current Flemish, French, English and Dutch. The Flemish environment provided a large artistic audience for proverb-filled paintings because proverbs were well known and recognisable as well as entertaining. &quot;Children&#x27;s Games&quot; shows the variety of amusements enjoyed by young people. His winter landscapes of 1565, like &quot;The Hunters in the Snow&quot;, are taken as corroborative evidence of the severity of winters during the Little Ice Age. Bruegel often painted community events, as in &quot;The Peasant Wedding&quot; and &quot;The Fight Between Carnival and Lent&quot;. In paintings like &quot;The Peasant Wedding&quot;, Bruegel painted individual, identifiable people, while the people in &quot;The Fight Between Carnival and Lent&quot; are unidentifiable, muffin-faced allegories of greed or gluttony.

Bruegel also painted religious scenes in a wide Flemish landscape setting, as in the &quot;Conversion of Paul&quot; and &quot;The Sermon of St. John the Baptist&quot;. Even if Bruegel&#x27;s subject matter was unconventional, the religious ideals and proverbs driving his paintings were typical of the Northern Renaissance. He accurately depicted people with disabilities, such as in &quot;The Blind Leading the Blind&quot;, which depicted a quote from the Bible: &quot;If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch&quot; (Matthew 15:14). Using the Bible to interpret this painting, the six blind men are symbols of the blindness of mankind in pursuing earthly goals instead of focusing on Christ&#x27;s teachings.

Using abundant spirit and comic power, Bruegel created some of the very early images of acute social protest in art history. Examples include paintings such as &quot;The Fight Between Carnival and Lent&quot; (a satire of the conflicts of the Protestant Reformation) and engravings like &quot;The Ass in the School&quot; and &quot;Strongboxes Battling Piggybanks&quot;.

In the 1560s, Bruegel moved to a style showing only a few large figures, typically in a landscape background without a distant view. His paintings dominated by their landscapes take a middle course as regards both the number and size of figures.

; Late monumental peasant figures
===Landscape elements===
Bruegel adapted and made more natural the world landscape style, which shows small figures in an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint that includes mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings. Back in Antwerp from Italy he was commissioned in the 1550s by the publisher Hieronymus Cock to make drawings for a series of engravings, the &quot;Large Landscapes&quot;, to meet what was now a growing demand for landscape images.

Some of his earlier paintings, such as his &quot;Landscape with the Flight into Egypt&quot; (Courtauld, 1563), are fully within the Patinir conventions, but his &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot; (known from two copies) had a Patinir-style landscape, in which already the largest figure was a genre figure who was only a bystander for the supposed narrative subject, and may not even be aware of it. The date of Bruegel&#x27;s lost original is unclear, but it is probably relatively early, and if so, foreshadows the trend of his later works. During the 1560s the early scenes crowded with multitudes of very small figures, whether peasant genre figures or figures in religious narratives, give way to a small number of much larger figures.

====Months of the year====
His famous set of landscapes with genre figures depicting the seasons are the culmination of his landscape style; the five surviving paintings use the basic elements of the world landscape (only one lacks craggy mountains) but transform them into his own style. They are larger than most previous works, with a genre scene with several figures in the foreground, and the panoramic view seen past or through trees. Bruegel was also aware of the Danube School&#x27;s landscape style through old master prints. The surviving five paintings are &quot;The Gloomy Day&quot; (February-March), &quot;The Hunters in the Snow&quot; (December-January), and &quot;The Return of the Herd&quot; (October-November) which are on display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna; &quot;The Hay Harvest&quot; (June-July) is on display in the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague; and &quot;The Harvesters&quot; which is on display at the Metropolitan in New York. The painting associated with the April-May seasonal transition is assumed to be lost.

The series on the months of the year includes several of Bruegel&#x27;s best-known works. In 1565, a wealthy patron in Antwerp, Niclaes Jonghelinck, commissioned him to paint a series of paintings of each month of the year. There has been dispute among art historians as to whether the series originally included six or twelve works. Joseph Koerner in his 2018 book &quot;Bosch and Bruegel&quot; states that Archduke Ernst, who took possession of the paintings after Niclaes defaulted on taxes, had as early as 1569 inventoried only six paintings in this series during the year of Bruegel&#x27;s death. The collection is next inventoried to be in the possession of Archduke Leopold who in 1659 indicated that five of them were extant. Only five of these paintings are known to have survived into the 21st century. Traditional Flemish luxury books of hours (e.g., the ; 1416) had calendar pages that included the Labours of the Months, depictions set in landscapes of the agricultural tasks, weather, and social life typical for that month.

Bruegel&#x27;s paintings were on a far larger scale than a typical calendar page painting, each one approximately three feet by five feet. For Bruegel, this was a large commission (the price of a commission was based on how large the painting was) and an important one. In 1565, the Calvinist riots began and it was only two years before the Eighty Years&#x27; War broke out. Bruegel may have felt safer with a secular commission so as to not offend Calvinist or Catholic. Some of the most famous paintings from this series included &quot;The Hunters in the Snow&quot; (December–January) and &quot;The Harvesters&quot; (August-September).

==Prints and drawings==

On his return from Italy to Antwerp, Bruegel earned his living producing drawings to be turned into prints for the leading print publisher of the city, and indeed northern Europe, Hieronymus Cock. At his &quot;House of the Four Winds&quot; Cock ran a production and distribution operation efficiently turning out prints of many sorts that was more concerned with sales than the finest artistic achievement. Most of Bruegel&#x27;s prints come from this period, but he continued to produce drawn designs for prints until the end of his life, leaving only two completed out of a series of the &quot;Four Seasons&quot;. The prints were popular and it is reasonable to assume that all those published have survived. In many cases we also have Bruegel&#x27;s drawings. Although the subject matter of his graphic work was often continued in his paintings, there are considerable differences in emphases between the two &quot;oeuvres&quot;. To his contemporaries and for long after, until public museums and good reproductions of the paintings made these better known, Bruegel was much better known through his prints than his paintings, which largely explains the critical assessment of him as merely the creator of comic peasant scenes.

The prints are mostly engravings, though from about 1559 onwards some are etchings or mixtures of both techniques. Only one complete woodcut was made from a Bruegel design, with another left incomplete. This, &quot;The Dirty Wife&quot;, is a most unusual survival (now Metropolitan Museum of Art) of a drawing on the wooden block intended for printing. For some reason, the specialist block-cutter who carved away the block, following the drawing while also destroying it, had only done one corner of the design before stopping work. The design then appears as an engraving, perhaps soon after Bruegel&#x27;s death.
Among his greatest successes were a series of allegories, among several designs adopting many of the very individual mannerisms of his compatriot Hieronymus Bosch: &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; and &quot;The Virtues&quot;. The sinners are grotesque and unidentifiable while the allegories of virtue often wear odd headgear. That imitations of Bosch sold well is demonstrated by his drawing &quot;Big Fish Eat Little Fish&quot; (now Albertina), which Bruegel signed but Cock shamelessly attributed to Bosch in the print version.

Although Bruegel presumably made them, no drawings that are clearly preparatory studies for paintings survive. Most surviving drawings are finished designs for prints, or landscape drawings that are fairly finished. After a considerable purge of attributions in recent decades, led by Hans Mielke, sixty-one sheets of drawings are now generally agreed to be by Bruegel. A new &quot;Master of the Mountain Landscapes&quot; has emerged from the carnage. Mielke&#x27;s key observation was that the lily watermark on the paper of several sheets was only found from around 1580 onwards, which led to the rapid acceptance of his proposal. Another group of about twenty-five pen drawings of landscapes, many signed and dated as by Bruegel, are now given to Jacob Savery, probably from the decade of so before his death in 1603. A giveaway was that two drawings including the walls of Amsterdam were dated 1563 but included elements only built in the 1590s. This group appears to have been made as deliberate forgeries.

==Family==
Around 1563, Bruegel moved from Antwerp to Brussels, where he married Mayken Coecke, the daughter of the painter Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Mayken Verhulst. As registered in the archives of the Cathedral of Antwerp, their deposition for marriage was registered 25 July 1563. The marriage was concluded in the Chapel Church, Brussels in 1563.

Pieter the Elder had two sons: Pieter Brueghel the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder (both kept their name as Brueghel). Their grandmother, Mayken Verhulst, trained the sons because &quot;the Elder&quot; died when both were very small children. The older brother, Pieter Brueghel copied his father&#x27;s style and compositions with competence and considerable commercial success. Jan was much more original, and very versatile. He was an important figure in the transition to the Baroque style in Flemish Baroque painting and Dutch Golden Age painting in a number of its genres. He was often a collaborator with other leading artists, including with Peter Paul Rubens on many works including the &quot;Allegory of Sight&quot;.

Other members of the family include Jan van Kessel the Elder (grandson of Jan Brueghel the Elder) and Jan van Kessel the Younger. Through David Teniers the Younger, son-in-law of Jan Brueghel the Elder, the family is also related to the whole Teniers family of painters and the Quellinus family of painters and sculptors, through the marriage of Jan-Erasmus Quellinus to Cornelia, daughter of David Teniers the Younger.

==Reception history==
Bruegel&#x27;s art was long more highly valued by collectors than critics. His friend Abraham Ortelius described him in a friendship album in 1574 as &quot;the most perfect painter of his century&quot;, but both Vasari and Van Mander see him as essentially a comic successor to Hieronymus Bosch. As well as being forward-looking, his art reinvigorates medieval subjects such as marginal drolleries of ordinary life in illuminated manuscripts, and the calendar scenes of agricultural labours set in landscape backgrounds, and puts these on a much larger scale than before, and in the expensive medium of oil painting. He does the same with the fantastic and anarchic world developed in Renaissance prints and book illustrations.

Bruegel&#x27;s work was, as far as we know, always keenly collected. The banker Nicolaes Jonghelinck owned sixteen paintings; his brother Jacques Jonghelinck was a gentleman-sculptor and medallist, who also had significant business interests. He made medals and tombs in an international style for the Brussels elite, especially Cardinal Granvelle, who was also a keen patron of Bruegel. Granvelle owned at least two Bruegels, including the Courtauld &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot;, but we do not know if he bought them directly from the artist. Granvelle&#x27;s nephew and heir was strong-armed out of his Bruegels by Rudolf II, the very acquisitive Austrian Habsburg Emperor. The series of the &quot;Months&quot; entered the Habsburg collections in 1594, given to Rudolf&#x27;s brother and later taken by the emperor himself. Rudolf eventually owned at least ten Bruegel paintings. A generation later Rubens owned eleven or twelve, which mostly passed to the Antwerp senator Pieter Stevens, and were then sold in 1668.

Bruegel&#x27;s son Pieter could still keep himself and a large studio team busy producing replicas or adaptations of Bruegel&#x27;s works, as well as his own compositions along similar lines, sixty years or more after they were first painted. The most frequently copied works were generally not the ones that are most famous today, though this may reflect the availability of the full-scale detailed drawings that were evidently used. The most-copied painting is the &quot;Winter Landscape with (Skaters and) a Bird Trap&quot; (1565), of which the original is in Brussels; 127 copies are recorded. They include paintings after some of Bruegel&#x27;s drawn print designs, especially &quot;Spring&quot;.

The next century&#x27;s artists of peasant genre scenes were heavily influenced by Brueghel. Outside the Brueghel family, early figures were Adriaen Brouwer (/6 – 1638) and David Vinckboons (1576 – c. 1632), both Flemish-born but spending much of their time in the northern Netherlands. As well as the general conception of such &quot;kermis&quot; subjects, Vinckboons and other artists took from Bruegel &quot;such stylistic devices as the bird&#x27;s-eye perspective, ornamentalised vegetation, bright palette, and stocky, odious figures.&quot; Forty years after their deaths, and over a century after Bruegel&#x27;s, Jan Steen (1626–79) continued to show a particular interest in Bruegelian treatments.

The critical treatment of Bruegel as essentially an artist of comic peasant scenes persisted until the late 19th century, even after his best paintings became widely visible as royal and aristocratic collections were turned into museums. This had been partly explicable when his work was mainly known from copies, prints and reproductions. Even Henri Hymans, whose work of 1890/1891 was the first important contribution to modern Bruegel scholarship, could describe him thus: &quot;His field of enquiry is certainly not of the most extensive; his ambition, too, is modest. He confines himself to a knowledge of mankind and the most immediate objects&quot;, a line no modern scholar is likely to take. As his landscape paintings, in good colour reproduction, have become his best-loved works, so his importance in the history of landscape art has become understood.

==Works==
There are about forty generally accepted surviving paintings, twelve of which are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Others are known to have been lost, including what, according to van Mander, Bruegel himself thought his best work, &quot;a picture in which Truth triumphs&quot;.

Bruegel only etched one plate himself, &quot;The Rabbit Hunt,&quot; but designed some forty prints, both engravings and etchings, mostly for the Cock publishing house. As discussed above, about sixty-one drawings are now recognised as authentic, mostly designs for prints or landscapes.

==References in other works==
===In literature===

His painting &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot;, now thought only to survive in copies, is the subject of the final lines of the 1938 poem &quot;Musée des Beaux Arts&quot; by W. H. Auden:

&lt;poem&gt;
In Brueghel&#x27;s Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away
Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.
&lt;/poem&gt;

It also was the subject of a 1960 poem &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot; by William Carlos Williams, and was mentioned in Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s 1976 science fiction film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;. Williams&#x27; final collection of poetry alludes to several of Bruegel&#x27;s works.

Bruegel&#x27;s painting &quot;Two Monkeys&quot; was the subject of Wisława Szymborska&#x27;s 1957 poem, &quot;Brueghel&#x27;s Two Monkeys&quot;.

Seamus Heaney refers to Brueghel in his poem &quot;The Seed Cutters&quot;. David Jones alludes to the painting &quot;The Blind Leading the Blind&quot; in his World War One prose-poem &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;: &quot;the stumbling dark of the blind, that Breughel knew about – ditch circumscribed&quot;.

Michael Frayn&#x27;s novel &quot;Headlong&quot;, imagines a lost panel from the 1565 &quot;Months&quot; series resurfacing unrecognised, which triggers a conflict between an art (and money) lover and the boor who possesses it. Much thought is spent on Bruegel&#x27;s secret motives for painting it.

Author Don Delillo uses Bruegel&#x27;s painting &quot;The Triumph of Death&quot; in his novel &quot;Underworld&quot; and his short story &quot;Pafko at the Wall&quot;. It is believed that the painting &quot;The Hunters in the Snow&quot; influenced the classic short story with the same title written by Tobias Wolff and featured in &quot;In the Garden of the North American Martyrs&quot;.

In the foreword to his novel &quot;The Folly of the World&quot;, author Jesse Bullington explains that Bruegel&#x27;s painting &quot;Netherlandish Proverbs&quot; inspired the title and also the plot to some extent. Various sections are introduced with a proverb depicted in the painting that alludes to a plot element.

Poet Sylvia Plath refers to Bruegel&#x27;s painting &quot;The Triumph of Death&quot; in her poem &quot;Two Views of a Cadaver Room&quot; from her 1960 collection &quot;The Colossus and Other Poems&quot;.

===In film===
Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky refers to Bruegel&#x27;s paintings in his films several times, notably in &quot;Solaris&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Mirror&quot; (1975).

Director Lars von Trier also uses Bruegel&#x27;s paintings in his film &quot;Melancholia&quot; (2011). This was used as a reference to Tarkovsky&#x27;s &quot;Solaris&quot;, a movie with related themes.

His 1564 painting &quot;The Procession to Calvary&quot; inspired the 2011 Polish-Swedish film co-production &quot;The Mill and the Cross&quot;, in which Bruegel is played by Rutger Hauer. Bruegel&#x27;s paintings in the Kunsthistorisches Museum are shown in the 2012 film, &quot;Museum Hours&quot;, where his work is discussed in casual conversations between a security guard at the museum and a visitor from Montreal visiting a hospitalised relative, and taking time off between hospital visits to go to the museum. Some attention is given to tour guides making presentations about some of the Bruegel paintings.

<doc id="64386" wikidata="Q209050" url="?curid=64386" title="Jan Brueghel the Elder">
<text>Jan Brueghel (also Bruegel or Breughel) the Elder ( , ; ; 1568 – 13 January 1625) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman. He was the younger son of the eminent Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder. A close friend and frequent collaborator with Peter Paul Rubens, the two artists were the leading Flemish painters in the Flemish Baroque painting of the first three decades of the 17th century.

Brueghel worked in many genres including history paintings, flower still lifes, allegorical and mythological scenes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, village scenes, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. He was an important innovator who invented new types of paintings such as flower garland paintings, paradise landscapes, and gallery paintings in the first quarter of the 17th century. However, he generally avoided painting large figures, as in portraits, though he often collaborated with other painters who did these, while he did the landscape backgrounds, and sometimes the clothes.

He further created genre paintings that were imitations, pastiches and reworkings of his father&#x27;s works, in particular his father&#x27;s genre scenes and landscapes with peasants. Brueghel represented the type of the &quot;pictor doctus&quot;, the erudite painter whose works are informed by the religious motifs and aspirations of the Catholic Counter-Reformation as well as the scientific revolution with its interest in accurate description and classification. He was court painter of the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella, sovereigns of the Spanish Netherlands.

The artist was nicknamed &quot;Velvet&quot; Brueghel, &quot;Flower&quot; Brueghel, and &quot;Paradise&quot; Brueghel. The first is believed to have been given him because of his mastery in the rendering of fabrics. The second nickname is a reference to his fame as a painter of (although not a specialist in) flower pieces and the last one to his invention of the genre of the paradise landscape. His brother Pieter Brueghel the Younger was traditionally nicknamed &quot;de helse Brueghel&quot; or &quot;Hell Brueghel&quot; because it was believed he was the author of a number of paintings with fantastic depictions of fire and grotesque imagery. These paintings have now been reattributed to Jan Brueghel the Elder.

==Life==
Jan Brueghel the Elder was born in Brussels as the son of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Maria (called &#x27;Mayken&#x27;) Coecke van Aelst. His mother was the daughter of the prominent Flemish Renaissance artists Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Mayken Verhulst. His father died about a year after Jan&#x27;s birth in 1569. It is believed that after the death of his mother in 1578, Jan, together with his older brother Pieter Brueghel the Younger and sister Marie, went to live with their grandmother Verhulst, who was by then widowed. The early Flemish biographer Karel van Mander wrote in his Schilder-boeck published in 1604 that Verhulst was the first art teacher of her two grandsons. She taught them drawing and watercolour painting of miniatures. Jan and his brother may also have trained with local artists in Brussels who were active as tapestry designers.
Jan and his brother Pieter were then sent to Antwerp to study oil painting. According to Karel van Mander he studied under Peter Goetkint, an important dealer with a large collection of paintings in his shop. Goetkint died on 15 July 1583 not very long after Jan had started his training. It is possible that Jan continued his studies in this shop, which was taken over by Goetkint&#x27;s widow, as no other master is recorded.

It was common for Flemish painters of that time to travel to Italy to complete their studies. Jan Brueghel left for Italy, first travelling to Cologne where his sister Marie and her family lived. He later visited Frankenthal, an important cultural centre where a number of Flemish landscape artists were active. 
He then travelled on to Naples after probably spending time in Venice. In Naples he produced some drawings after June 1590 which show his interest in landscapes and monumental architecture. He worked for Don Francesco Caracciolo, a prominent nobleman and priest and founder of the Clerics Regular Minor. Jan produced small-scale cabinet paintings for Don Francesco.

Brueghel left Naples for Rome where he lived from 1592 to 1594. He befriended Paul Bril, a landscape specialist from Antwerp who had moved to Rome in the late 16th century. Together with his brother Mathijs Bril, he created atmospheric landscapes for many Roman residences. Brueghel took inspiration from Bril&#x27;s lively drawings and small-scale landscapes of the mid-1590s. During his time in Rome Jan Brueghel became acquainted with Hans Rottenhammer, a German painter of small highly finished cabinet paintings on copper. Rottenhammer painted religious and mythological compositions, combining German and Italian elements of style, which were highly esteemed. Brueghel collaborated with both Paul Bril and Rottenhammer. Brueghel also spent time making watercolours of Rome&#x27;s antique monuments and seemed particularly fascinated by the vaulted interiors of the Colosseum.
He enjoyed the protection of Cardinal Ascanio Colonna. In Rome he also met Cardinal Federico Borromeo, who played an important role in the Counter-Reformation and was also an avid art collector. The Cardinal became Brueghel&#x27;s lifelong friend and patron. Brueghel took up residence in Borromeo&#x27;s Palazzo Vercelli. When Borromeo became archbishop of Milan in June 1595, Brueghel followed him and became part of the Cardinal&#x27;s household. He produced many landscape and flower paintings for the Cardinal.

Brueghel stayed about a year in Milan and in 1596 he had returned to Antwerp where he remained active, save for a few interruptions, for the rest of his life. A year after his return Jan Brueghel was admitted as a Free Master in Antwerp&#x27;s Guild of Saint Luke as the son of a master. The artist married on 23 January 1599 in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp. The bride was Isabella de Jode, the daughter of the cartographer, engraver and publisher Gerard de Jode. Their son Jan was born on 13 September 1601. This first-born had Rubens as his godfather and later took over his father&#x27;s workshop and was known as Jan Brueghel the Younger.
Brueghel was registered as a burgher of Antwerp on 4 October 1601 as &#x27;Jan Bruegel, Peetersone, schilder, van Bruessele&#x27; (&#x27;Jan Bruegel, son of Peeter, painter, of Brussels&#x27;). Just a month before, Brueghel had been elected dean of the Guild of Saint Luke, but he had not been able to take up the position as he was not a burgher of Antwerp. Upon becoming formally registered as a burgher the same year Brueghel could finally be the dean. The next year he was re-elected as dean.

In 1603 his daughter Paschasia Brueghel was born. Rubens was also her godfather. His wife Isabella de Jode died the same year leaving him with two young children. It has been speculated that death of his wife was linked to the birth of his latest child.
In the mid-1604 Brueghel visited Prague, the main location of the court of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, who promoted artistic innovation. The Emperor&#x27;s court had attracted many Northern artists such as Bartholomeus Spranger and Hans von Aachen who created a new affected style, full of conceits, today known as Northern Mannerism.

Upon returning to Antwerp in September 1604 Brueghel bought a large house called &quot;De Meerminne&quot; (The Mermaid) in the Lange Nieuwstraat in Antwerp on 20 September 1604. The artist remarried in April 1605. With his second wife Catharina van Mariënburg he had 8 children of whom Ambrosius became a painter.
After his appointment in 1606 as court painter to the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella, sovereigns of the Spanish Netherlands, the artist was present in Brussels for periods in 1606, 1609, 1610 and 1613. On 28 August 1613 the court in Brussels paid Brueghel 3625 guilders for completing various works.

From October 1610 onwards Rubens started taking on the role of intermediary for his friend Jan Brueghel. By 1625 Rubens had written about 25 letters to Cardinal Borromeo on behalf of Brueghel. In a letter to Borromeo Brueghel referred, jokingly, to his friend&#x27;s role as that of &quot;mio secretario Rubens&quot; (my secretary Rubens). In 1612 or 1613 Peter Paul Rubens painted a portrait of Jan Brueghel and his family (Courtauld Institute, London). In 1613 he accompanied Rubens and Hendrick van Balen the Elder on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic. Here they met Hendrick Goltzius and other Haarlem artists.
When John Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach passed through Antwerp in 1614 he took time to pay a visit to Rubens and Brueghel in their workshops. Brueghel received many official commissions from the Antwerp city magistrate. Four of his paintings were offered by the Antwerp city magistrates to the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella on 27 August 1615. He was in 1618 one of twelve important painters from Antwerp who were commissioned by the Antwerp city magistrates to produce a series of paintings for the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella. For this commission, Brueghel coordinated the work on a painting cycle depicting an &quot;Allegory of the Five Senses&quot;. The artists participating in the project included Rubens, Frans Snyders, Frans Francken the Younger, Joos de Momper, Hendrick van Balen the Elder and Sebastiaen Vrancx. The works were destroyed in a fire in 1713.
On 9 March 1619 Brueghel bought a third house called Den Bock (the Billy Goat) located in the Antwerp Arenbergstraat. When on 6 August 1623 his daughter Clara Eugenia was baptized, Archduchess Isabella and Cardinal Borromeo were her godparents. Jan Brueghel died on 13 January 1625 in Antwerp from complications arising from a gastrointestinal upset.

The artist&#x27;s estate was distributed on 3 June and 23 June 1627 among his surviving wife and his children from both marriages. Rubens, Hendrick van Balen the Elder, Cornelis Schut and Paulus van Halmaele were the executors of his last will. Rubens was the guardian of the surviving Brueghel children.

His students included his son Jan as well as Daniel Seghers. Brueghel&#x27;s daughter Paschasia married the painter Hieronymus van Kessel the Younger, and their son Jan van Kessel the Elder studied with Jan Brueghel the Younger. Brueghel&#x27;s daughter Anna married David Teniers the Younger in 1637.

==Work==
===General===
Jan Brueghel the Elder was a versatile artist who practised in many genres and introduced various new subjects into Flemish art. He was an innovator who contributed to the development of the various genres to which he put his hand such as flower still lifes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. His best-known innovations are the new types of paintings, which he introduced into the repertoire of Flemish art in the first quarter of the 17th century such as flower garland paintings, paradise landscapes and paintings of art galleries. Unlike contemporary Flemish Baroque artists, such as Rubens, he did not produce large altarpieces for the local churches.

Jan Brueghel the Elder achieved a superb technical mastery, which enabled him to render materials, animals and landscapes with remarkable accuracy and a high degree of finish. He had an accomplished miniaturist technique allowing him to achieve an accurate description of nature.
Little is known about the workshop practices of Brueghel. He operated a large workshop that allowed him to produce a large quantity of works, which were in turn reproduced in his workshop. After Brueghel&#x27;s death in 1625, Jan Brueghel the Younger took charge of his father&#x27;s workshop which he operated in the same way as his father. This is clear in the style of the surviving paintings which are in the vein of his father&#x27;s and the continued collaboration with former collaborators of his father such as Rubens and Hendrick van Balen. This workshop production contributed to the wide distribution of Jan Brueghel the Elder&#x27;s creations.

While his brother Pieter was engaged in the large-scale production of numerous works for the Antwerp art market, Jan Brueghel worked for a select clientele of aristocratic patrons and collectors of pictures to create more expensive and exclusive images. His works, such as his paradise landscapes, appealed to the aesthetic preferences of aristocrats who loved collecting such precious objects. His works, often painted on copper, were luxury objects intended for the simple pleasure of viewing as well as contemplation.

===Collaborations===

Collaboration between artists specialised in distinctive genres was a defining feature of artistic practice in 17th-century Antwerp. Jan Brueghel was likewise a frequent collaborator with fellow artists. As he was an artist with a wide range of skills he worked with a number of collaborators in various genres. His collaborators included landscape artists Paul Bril and Joos de Momper, architectural painter Paul Vredeman de Vries and figure painters Frans Francken the Younger, Hendrick de Clerck, Pieter van Avont and Hendrick van Balen.

His collaborations with figure painter Hans Rottenhammer began in Rome around 1595 and ended in 1610. Rottenhammer was a gifted figure painter and known for his skill in painting nudes. Initially when the artists both lived in Venice, their collaborative works were executed on canvas, but in their later collaborations after Brueghel had returned to Antwerp they typically used copper. After Brueghel&#x27;s return to Antwerp, their collaboration practice was for Brueghel to send the coppers with the landscape to Rottenhammer in Venice, who painted in the figures and then returned the coppers. In a few instances, the process was the other way around. Brueghel and Rottenhammer did not collaborate only on landscape paintings with figures; they jointly created one of the earliest devotional garland paintings, made for Cardinal Federico Borromeo, depicting a Virgin and Child surrounded by a flower garland (Pinacoteca Ambrosiana).
While in his collaborations with Hans Rottenhammer, the landscapes were made by Brueghel, the roles were reversed when he worked with Joos de Momper as it was Brueghel who provided the figures to the landscapes painted by de Momper. An example of their collaboration is &quot;Mountain Landscape with Pilgrims in a Grotto Chapel&quot; (, Liechtenstein Museum). There are about 59 known collaborations between Brueghel and de Momper making de Momper his most frequent collaborator. Hendrick van Balen the Elder was another regular collaborator with Jan Brueghel. Their collaboration was simplified by the fact that from 1604 onwards both painters had moved to the Lange Nieuwstraat, which made it easier to carry the panels and copper plates on which they collaborated back and forth.

Another frequent collaborator of Jan Brueghel was Rubens. The two artists executed about 25 joint works between 1598 and 1625. Their first collaboration was on &quot;The Battle of the Amazons&quot; (-1600, Sanssouci Picture Gallery). The artists worked together in the development of the genre of the devotional garland painting with works such as the &quot;Madonna in a Floral Wreath&quot; (-1618, Alte Pinakothek). They further jointly made mythological scenes and an allegorical series representing the Five Senses. The collaboration between the two friends was remarkable because they worked in very different styles and specialisations and were artists of equal status. They were able to preserve the individuality of their respective styles in these joint works.
Brueghel appears to have been the principal initiator of their joint works, which were made principally during the second half of the 1610s when their method of collaboration had become more systemised and included Rubens&#x27; workshop. Usually it would be Brueghel who started a painting and he would leave space for Rubens to add the figures. In their early collaborations they seem to have made major corrections to the work of the other. For instance, in the early collaborative effort &quot;The Return from War: Mars Disarmed by Venus&quot; Rubens overpainted most of the lower-right corner with grey paint so he could enlarge his figures. In later collaborations the artists seem to have streamlined their collaboration and agreed on the composition early on so that these later works show little underdrawing. As court painters to the archdukes their collaborations reflected the court&#x27;s desire to emphasise the continuity of its reign with the previous Burgundian and Habsburg rulers as well as the rulers&#x27; piousness. While they were mindful of the prevailing tastes in courtly circles, which favoured subjects such as the hunt, the two artists were creative in their response to the court&#x27;s preferences by devising new iconography and genres, such as the devotional garland paintings, which were equally capable of conveying the devoutness and splendour of the archducal court. The joint artistic output of Brueghel and Rubens was highly prized by collectors all over Europe.

===Ideological context===

Jan Brueghel&#x27;s work reflects the various ideological currents at work in the Catholic Spanish Netherlands during his lifetime. The Catholic Counter-Reformation&#x27;s worldview played an important role in the artist&#x27;s practice. Central in this worldview was the belief that the earth and its inhabitants were revelations of a supreme being, God. Artistic representation of, and scientific investigation into, that divine revelation was encouraged and valued. Breughel&#x27;s friend and patron, the Counter-Reformation Cardinal Federico Borromeo, particularly emphasised the beauty and diversity of the animal world. In his &quot;I tre libri delle laudi divine&quot; (published only posthumously in 1632) Borromeo wrote: &#x27;Looking then with attentive study at animals&#x27; construction and formation, and at their parts, members, and characters, can it not be said how excellently divine wisdom has demonstrated the value of its great works?&#x27; Jan Brueghel&#x27;s realistic depictions of nature in all its various forms, in flowers, landscapes, animals, etc., was clearly in line with the view that study of God&#x27;s creation was an important source for knowing God.
Brueghel&#x27;s era also saw a growing interest in the study of nature through empirical evidence as opposed to relying on inherited tradition. The increased access to new animals and exotic plants from the newly discovered territories played an important role in this intellectual exploration. This resulted in the appearance of the first scholarly catalogues and encyclopedias, including the illustrated natural history catalogues of 16th-century naturalists Conrad Gesner and Ulisse Aldrovandi. Their major contribution to natural history was the creation of an extensive system of description of each animal. Gesner placed all the species within four general categories: quadrupeds, birds, fish and serpents. He described animals in alphabetical order and in terms of nomenclature, geographic origins, mode of living and behaviour. Aldrovandi took another approach and did not order animals alphabetically. He relied on visual resemblance as the classifying factor. For example, he grouped the horse together with analogous animals, such as the donkey and mule, and separated species into categories, such as birds with webbed feet and nocturnal birds.
Brueghel&#x27;s works reflect this contemporary encyclopedic interest in the classification and ordering of all of the natural world. This is evidenced in his flower pieces, landscapes, allegorical works and gallery paintings. In his paradise landscapes, for instance, Brueghel grouped most of the species according to their basic categories of biological classification, in other words, according to the main groups of related species that resemble one another, such as birds or quadrupeds. He further classified most of them into subdivisions consisting of similar morphological and behavioural characteristics. His paradise landscapes thus constituted a visual catalogue of animals and birds which fulfilled the role of micro-encyclopedia.

Brueghel&#x27;s endeavour to represent the world through ordering and classifying its many elements based on empirical observation did not stop with the natural world. In Prague he had acquired knowledge of the large collections of Emperor Rudolf II, which were divided in natural, artificial and scientific objects. Brueghel&#x27;s allegorical paintings of the four elements and of the five senses reveal the same classifying obsession, using each element or sense to organise natural, man-made instruments and scientific objects. In this skillful union of the areas of art, science, and nature Brueghel demonstrates his mastery of these various disciplines. His paintings serve the same purpose to that of encyclopedic collections, then known as cabinets of curiosities, by linking between the &quot;mundus sensibilis&quot; and the &quot;mundus intelligibilis&quot;. His approach to describing and cataloguing nature in art resembles the distinction natural historians were starting to make between perceptual experience and theoretical knowledge.
Brueghel&#x27;s obsession with classifying the world was completely in line with the encyclopedic tastes of the court in Brussels as is demonstrated by their large art collection of predominantly Flemish paintings, menagerie of exotic species and extensive library.

===Flower paintings===
Jan Brueghel the Elder was one of the first artists in the Habsburg Netherlands who started to paint pure flower still lifes. A pure flower still life depicts flowers, typically arranged in a vase or other vessel, as the principal subject of the picture, rather than as a subordinate part of another work such as a history painting. Jan Brueghel is regarded as an important contributor to the emerging genre of the flower piece in Northern art, a contribution that was already appreciated in his time when he received the nickname &#x27;Flower Brueghel&#x27;. While the traditional interpretation of these flower pieces was that they were vanitas symbols or allegories of transience with hidden meanings, it is now more common to interpret them as mere depictions of the natural world. Brueghel&#x27;s approach to these works was informed by his desire to display his skill in giving a realistic, almost scientific rendering of nature. These works reflected the ideological concerns demonstrated in his work, which combined the worldview that nature was a revelation of a god with the interest in gaining a scientific understanding of nature.
Brueghel&#x27;s flower pieces are dominated by the floral arrangements, which are placed against a neutral dark background. Minor details such as insects, butterflies, snails and separate sprays of flowers or rosemary may occasionally be added but are subordinate to the principal subject. While Brueghel sought out very rare flowers, he used certain common blooms such as tulips, irises and roses to anchor his bouquets. This may have been a response to his patrons&#x27; wishes as well as compositional considerations. His bouquets were typically composed of flowers blooming in different seasons of the year so they could never have been painted together directly from nature. Brueghel was in the habit of travelling to make drawings of flowers that were not available in Antwerp, so that he could paint them into his bouquets. Brueghel rendered the flowers with an almost scientific precision. He arranged each flower with hardly any overlap so that they are shown off to their best advantage, and many are shown at different angles. The flowers are arranged by size with smaller ones at the bottom of the bouquet, larger flowers such as tulips, cornflowers, peonies and guelder roses in the centre and large flowers, such as white lilies and blue irises, at the top of the bouquet.
This arrangement is clear in the &quot;Flowers in a Ceramic Vase&quot; (c. 1620, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). The vase in which the flowers are arranged is decorated with motifs in relief. The two cartouches - separated by a fantastic figure - show Amphitrite, a sea goddess from Greek mythology, on the left, and Ceres, the Roman corn goddess, on the right. These two goddesses were typically used in allegorical representations of the four elements to symbolise water and earth respectively. The other two cartouches on that part of the vase that is invisible likely show Vulcan, who was associated with fire, and Apollo, who was associated with air. The occurrence of the four elements and the flowers in a single work can be interpreted as the emanation of the macrocosm in the microcosm.
Brueghel often repeated motifs in his flower pieces. Even so, he was able to give each work a remarkable freshness and vitality of its own.

===Garland paintings===
Jan Brueghel the Elder played a key role in the invention and development of the genre of garland paintings. Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Together with Hendrick van Balen, he painted around 1607-1608 the first known garland painting for Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo, a passionate art collector and Catholic reformer. Borromeo requested the painting to respond to the destruction of images of the Virgin in the preceding century and it thus combined both the cardinal&#x27;s interests in Catholic reform and the arts. Brueghel, the still life specialist, painted the flower garland, while van Balen, a specialist figure painter, was responsible for the image of the Virgin.

The genre of garland paintings was inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Habsburg Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Brueghel&#x27;s collaborators on garland paintings included Rubens, Frans Francken the Younger and Pieter van Avont.

An example of a collaborative garland painting made by Jan Brueghel the Elder and Rubens is the &quot;Madonna in Floral Wreath&quot; (1621, Alte Pinakothek).

An example of a collaborative garland painting he made with Hendrick van Balen is the &quot;Garland of Fruit surrounding a Depiction of a Goddess Receiving Gifts from Personifications of the Four Seasons&quot; of which there are two versions, one in the Belfius collection and a second in the Mauritshuis in The Hague. Both versions are considered to be autograph paintings, but small differences between the two suggest that the panel in the Belfius collection is the original version. The medallion in the centre is traditionally believed to depict Cybele, the ancient Phrygian goddess of the earth and nature as it was described as such in 1774 when it was catalogued in the collection of William V, Prince of Orange in The Hague. More recently an identification of the goddess with Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships, has been proposed. The reason is that the goddess in the medallion has none of the attributes traditionally connected with Cybele. Around the medallion is suspended a garland of flowers, vegetables and fruit – a tribute to the goddess and an ode to plenty and fertility. Van Balen painted the medallion while Brueghel painted the abundant garland, the surrounding figures and the numerous animals.

===Landscapes===

Jan Brueghel&#x27;s father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, is regarded as an important innovator of landscape art. By introducing greater naturalism in his Alpine mountain settings, his father had expanded on the world landscape tradition that had been founded mainly by Joachim Patinir. Some of Pieter the Elder&#x27;s works also foreshadowed the forest landscape that would start to dominate landscape painting around the turn of the 16th century. Pieter the Elder also developed the village and rural landscape, placing Flemish hamlets and farms in exotic prospects of mountains and river valleys.

Jan developed on the formula he learned from his father of arranging country figures travelling a road, which recedes into the distance. He emphasised the recession into space by carefully diminishing the scale of figures in the foreground, middle-ground, and far distance. To further the sense of atmospheric perspective, he used varying tones of brown, green, and blue progressively to characterise the recession of space. His landscapes with their vast depth are balanced through his attention to the peasant figures and their humble activities in the foreground.

Like his father, Jan Brueghel also painted various village landscapes. He used the surrounding landscapes as the stage for the crowds of anecdotal, colourfully dressed peasants who engage in various activities in the market, the country roads and during the rowdy kermesses. Jan Brueghel&#x27;s landscape paintings with their strong narrative elements and attention to detail had a significant influence on Flemish and Dutch landscape artists in the second decade of the 17th century. His river views were certainly known to painters working in Haarlem, including Esaias van de Velde and Willem Buytewech, whom Brueghel may have met there when he accompanied Peter Paul Rubens on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic in 1613.
Jan Brueghel was along with artists such as Gillis van Coninxloo one of the prime developers of the dense forest landscape in the 17th century. Jan Breughel experimented with such works before Coninxloo&#x27;s first dated wooded landscape of 1598. In his forest landscapes Brueghel depicted heavily wooded glades in which he captured the verdant density, and even mystery, of the forest. Although on occasion inhabited by humans and animals, these forest scenes contain dark recesses, virtually no open sky and no outlet for the eye to penetrate beyond the thick trees.

===Paradise landscapes===

Jan Brueghel invented the &#x27;paradise landscape&#x27;, a subgenre that involved a combination of landscape and animal painting. Works in this genre are typically crawling with numerous animals from exotic and native European species who coexist harmoniously in a lush landscape setting. These landscapes are inspired by episodes from Genesis, the chapter of the bible, which tells the story of the creation of the world and of man. The favourite themes taken from Genesis where the creation of man, Adam and Eve in paradise, the fall of man and the entry of the animals in Noah&#x27;s ark.
Like his flower pieces, these landscapes were informed by the Catholic Counter-Reformation&#x27;s worldview, which regarded earth and its inhabitants as revelations of their god and valued artistic representation of, and scientific investigation into, that divine revelation. As described above, Breughel&#x27;s friend and patron, the Counter-Reformation Cardinal Federico Borromeo, had particularly emphasised the beauty and diversity of the animal world. Brueghel tried to render this worldview in his paradise landscapes. The novelty of Brueghel&#x27;s paradise landscapes lies not only in the impressive variety of animals, which the artist studied mainly from life but also in their presentation as both figures of a religious narrative and as subjects of a scientific order.
Brueghel developed his earliest paradise landscapes during his stay in Venice in the early 1590s. His first paradise landscape known as &quot;The Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man&quot; is now in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome. The reference to Genesis in the picture appears in a small vignette representing the creation of Man in the background, but the main focus is on the animals and the landscape itself. This work was the first paradise landscape in which Brueghel &#x27;catalogued&#x27; animals and depicts common and domesticated types. Brueghel&#x27;s interest in the cataloguing of animals was stimulated by his visit to the court of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague. The emperor had established an encyclopedic collection of rarities and animals. While in his early paradise landscapes Brueghel seems to have based some of his renderings of the animals on works by other artists, he later could rely on studies from life of the various species in the menagerie of the court in Brussels. Brueghel had also seen Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s depiction of animals during his visit to Prague and had made a painted copy of Dürer&#x27;s watercolour &quot;The Madonna with a Multitude of Animals&quot; (1503). Dürer&#x27;s representations of animals play a pivotal role in Renaissance zoology, since they are the purest artistic form of nature study. The studies of animals by Flemish artists Hans Bol and Joris Hoefnagel also had an important influence on Brueghel. In particular Hoefnagel&#x27;s &quot;Four Elements&quot; (1575–1582) was the first artistic work to categorise animals in a book format. Hoefnagel&#x27;s approach to the representation of the animal world combined natural historical, classical, emblematic, and biblical references, which incorporated the various species into the categories of the four elements of the cosmos: earth, water, air, and fire. Brueghel&#x27;s paradise landscapes also embodied the encyclopedic attitudes of his time by depicting a wide variety of species.

Brueghel continued refining his treatment of the subject of paradise landscapes throughout his career. The many renderings and variations of the paradise landscape produced by Brueghel earned him the nickname Paradise Brueghel.

===Allegorical paintings===

Jan Brueghel the Elder produced various sets of allegorical paintings, in particular on the themes of the &quot;Five senses&quot; and the &quot;Four Elements&quot;. These paintings were often collaborations with other painters such as is the case with the five paintings representing the &quot;Five senses&quot; on which Brueghel and Rubens collaborated and which are now in the Prado Museum in Madrid. He also collaborated with Hendrick van Balen on various allegorical compositions such as a series on the &quot;Four Elements&quot; as well as an &quot;Allegory of Public Welfare&quot; (Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest).

In his allegories Jan Breughel illustrated an abstract concept, such as one of the senses or one of the four elements through a multitude of concrete objects that can be associated with it. He thus represented a concept by means of descriptive tropes. Brueghel resorted in these allegorical compositions to the encyclopedic imagery that he also displayed in his paradise landscapes. This is demonstrated in his composition &quot;Allegory of Fire; Venus in the Forge of Vulcan&quot; of which there are various versions of which one (Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome) is a collaboration with Hendrick van Balen and another (Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Milan) is attributed to Jan Brueghel alone. Brueghel&#x27;s encyclopedic approach in this composition offers such detail that historians of science have relied on the composition as a source of information on the types of tools used in 17th-century metallurgical practice.

===Scenes of hell and demons===

Jan was early on nicknamed &#x27;Hell Brueghel&#x27; but by the 19th century that name had become erroneously associated with his brother Pieter the Younger. Jan Brueghel was given the nickname because of his scenes with demons and hell scenes. An example is the &quot;Temptation of St. Anthony&quot; (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which reprises a subject first explored by Hieronymus Bosch. In this demon-plagued scene the monsters are seen attacking the small saint in the corner of a large and dense forest landscape, rather than within the expanded panoramas of Patinir.

Jan Brueghel is believed to have produced his hell scenes for a newer, elite audience of learned and sophisticated collectors. To appeal to this erudite clientele he often populated the hell scenes with mythological rather than religious subjects, in particular the Vergilian scene of Aeneas in Hades, escorted by the Cumaean Sibyl. An example is &quot;Aeneas and the Sibyl in the Underworld&quot; (1619, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Other mythological themes appearing in his hell scenes included the image of Juno visiting Hades and Orpheus in the Underworld from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. An example of the latter is &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; (Palazzo Pitti). In these compositions brightly coloured monsters provide the &#x27;recreational terror&#x27; of the later manifestations of Boschian design.

Brueghel&#x27;s hell scenes were influential and Jacob van Swanenburg, one of Rembrandt&#x27;s teachers, was inspired by them to create his own hell scenes.

===Gallery paintings===

Jan Brueghel the Elder and Frans Francken the Younger were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s. Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. These rooms were often referred to as &quot;Kunstkammern&quot; (&quot;art rooms&quot;) or &quot;Wunderkammern&quot; (&quot;wonder rooms&quot;). The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. Some gallery paintings include portraits of the owners or collectors of the art objects or artists at work. The paintings are heavy with symbolism and allegory and are a reflection of the intellectual preoccupations of the age, including the cultivation of personal virtue and the importance of connoisseurship. The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens.
A famous example of a gallery painting by Jan Brueghel is &quot;The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector&#x27;s Cabinet&quot; (now referred to as &quot;The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting the Collection of Pieter Roose&quot;) (c. 1621–1623, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore). The work is believed to be a collaboration between Jan Brueghel the Elder and Hieronymus Francken II. This gallery painting represents the early phase of the genre of collector&#x27;s cabinets. During this early &#x27;encyclopaedic&#x27; phase, the genre reflected the culture of curiosity of that time, when art works, scientific instruments, naturalia and artificialia were equally the object of study and admiration. As a result, the cabinets depicted in these compositions are populated by persons who appear to be as interested in discussing scientific instruments as in admiring paintings. Later the genre concentrated more on galleries solely containing works of art. The compositions depicted in &quot;The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector&#x27;s Cabinet&quot; are predominantly allegories of iconoclasm and the victory of painting (art) over ignorance. They are references to the iconoclasm of the Beeldenstorm that had raged in the Low Countries in the 16th century and the victory over the iconoclasts during the reign of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella who jointly ruled the Spanish Netherlands in the beginning of the 17th century. Jan Brueghel was responsible for the large vase of flowers, which is crowned by a large sunflower. This South American flower, which could grow very tall and would turn towards the sun, was first seen by Europeans in the mid-16th century. It had been illustrated as a New World wonder in botanical treatises, but Jan Brueghel was the first to include the flower in a painting and use it as a symbol of princely patronage in this composition. By turning toward Albert and Isabella (taking the position of the sun), the sunflower symbolises the way that the arts were able to grow and blossom in the light and warmth of princely patronage.

===Singeries===
Breughel contributed to the development of the genre of the &#x27;monkey scene&#x27;, also called &#x27;singerie&#x27; (a word derived from the French for &#x27;monkey&#x27; and meaning a &#x27;comical grimace, behaviour or trick&#x27;). Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish painting in the 16th century and was further developed in the 17th century. Monkeys were regarded as shameless and impish creatures and excellent imitators of human behaviour. These depictions of monkeys enacting various human roles were a playful metaphor for all the folly in the world. 
The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which were strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists. The first one to do so was the Antwerp artist Frans Francken the Younger, who was quickly followed by Jan Brueghel the Elder, the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Jan van Kessel the Elder. Jan Brueghel the Elder&#x27;s son-in-law David Teniers the Younger became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. Later in the 17th century Nicolaes van Verendael started to paint these &#x27;monkey scenes&#x27; as well.

An example of a singerie by Jan Brueghel is the &quot;Monkeys feasting&quot;, which dates from his early years as an artist (private collection, on long-term loan to the Rubenshuis, Antwerp). This painting on copper was probably one of the first examples of a singerie painting. Jan Brueghel likely drew his monkeys in the zoo of the Archdukes in Brussels. While the composition shows the monkeys engaged in all kinds of mischief, it includes a painting above the door jamb, which is a work from Rubens&#x27; studio, called &quot;Ceres and Pan&quot;. The representation of Ceres and Pan provides a contrast between the cultivated versus the wild world of the monkeys below.

<text>Jan Brueghel (also Bruegel or Breughel) the Younger ( , ; ; 13 September 1601 – 1 September 1678) was a Flemish Baroque painter. He was the son of Jan Brueghel the Elder, and grandson of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, both prominent painters who contributed respectively to the development of Renaissance and Baroque painting in the Habsburg Netherlands. Taking over his father&#x27;s workshop at an early age, he largely painted the same subjects as his father in a style which was similar to that of his father. He gradually was able to break away from his father&#x27;s style by developing a broader, more painterly, and less structured manner of painting. He regularly collaborated with leading Flemish painters of his time.

==Life==
Jan Brueghel was born in Antwerp on 13 September 1601 as the son of Jan and Isabella de Jode. His mother was the daughter of the cartographer, engraver and publisher Gerard de Jode. He trained with his father in his workshop. His father was a friend and close collaborator of Rubens. Jan likely assisted with his father&#x27;s large-scale commissions.

On the wishes of his father he traveled around 1622 to Milan where he was welcomed by Cardinal Federico Borromeo. The cardinal was a patron and friend of his father who had met in Rome about 30 years earlier. In what was likely an act of rebellion against his father, he went to Genoa where he stayed with his cousins, the Antwerp painters and art dealers Lucas de Wael and Cornelis de Wael. Their mother was a sister of Jan&#x27;s mother. At the time his friend and fellow Antwerp artist Anthony van Dyck was also active in Genoa. He later worked in Valletta on Malta in 1623. From 1624 to 1625 he lived in Palermo on Sicily at the time when van Dyck was also working there.
Jan learned that his father had died on 13 January 1625 from cholera only after his return to Northern Italy in Turin. Wanting to return to Antwerp immediately, he had to delay his departure for 16 days due to a severe fever. After recovering from his illness, he set off for his homeland by way of France. In Paris he met the Antwerp art dealer and painter Peter Goetkint the Younger, who was the son of Peter Goetkint the Elder, the master of Jan&#x27;s father. Goetkint was eager to return to Antwerp because his wife was expected to deliver a baby soon. The child was born on 25 August, the day on which Jan Breughel arrived in Antwerp with his travelling companion who died a few days later. Jan took over the management of his father&#x27;s workshop, sold the finished works of his father and finished some of his father&#x27;s unfinished paintings. In the Guild year 1624–1625, Jan became a master painter of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp.

In 1626 he married Anna Maria Janssens, daughter of Abraham Janssens, a prominent history painter in Antwerp. He continued to operate the large workshop of his father. In 1630 he became dean of the Guild of Saint Luke, and was commissioned by the French court to paint a series of paintings of the biblical character Adam. It seems that his studio declined after this period and that he started to paint smaller scale paintings which commanded lower prices than those produced earlier.

He worked independently in Paris in the 1650s and produced paintings for the Austrian court in 1651. He is recorded again in Antwerp in 1657 where he remained for the remainder of his life . During a meeting of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke held on 8 October 1672, he got into a heated argument with Peter van Brekeveldt, another former dean of the guild, who injured him in an eye. As this injury affected his ability to paint, he sued van Brekeveldt for indemnification. He died on 1 September 1678 at his home address on the Pruymenstraat in Antwerp.

His pupils included his older sons Abraham, Philips and Jan Peeter, his nephew Jan van Kessel, and his younger brother Ambrosius.

==Work==
===General===

Taking over his father&#x27;s workshop at an early age, he painted the same subjects as his father in a style which was similar to that of his father. About 340 paintings have been attributed to him. His repertoire included history paintings, allegorical and mythological scenes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, village scenes, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. Unlike his father, he did not paint many flower still lifes. Like his father and uncle, he would also reinterpret the genre and landscape paintings of his grandfather Pieter Brueghel the Elder. An example is the &quot;Fight between Peasants&quot; (Dorotheum Vienna 30 April 2019, lot 383), which goes back to a now lost painting of his grandfather, which was likely in the collection of his father and of which a print exists. Whereas in the print after Pieter Brueghel the Elder the viewer looks at the scene a &#x27;spectator from a raised stage&#x27;, in Jan Brueghel the Younger&#x27;s version the viewer is more involved due to the lower viewpoint. Jan de Younger further created a new painting category of animals in landscapes. After the death of his father he changed his signature from &#x27;Brueghel&#x27; to &#x27;Breughel&#x27;.

While he did not surpass his father in the quality of his output, his early works can hardly be distinguished from those of his father in terms of their high level of execution. He gradually was able to break away from his father&#x27;s style by developing a broader, more painterly, and less structured manner of painting.

===Landscapes===
He painted a wide variety of landscapes including: landscapes of woods, rivers and harbours, villages, cityscapes, architectural views with figures, veduti, hell scenes, landscapes with the Holy Family, paradise landscapes and allegorical landscapes. These landscapes show his father&#x27;s influence although he would develop some personal touches in his later career.
His best works are his wide landscapes, which he produced on his own or in collaboration with other painters such as Hendrick van Balen the Elder and Joos de Momper. During his career, he collaborated with many other artists such as Jan van Balen - the son of his father&#x27;s collaborator Hendrick van Balen the Elder, Pieter de Lierner, Adriaen Stalbemt, Lucas Van Uden, his brother-in-law David Teniers the Younger, his father-in-law Abraham Janssens, Sebastiaen Vrancx, Denijs van Alsloot and Hendrik de Clerck. In view of the strong demand for large decorative landscapes at the time, Jan the Younger would sometimes have his father&#x27;s works copied in his workshop and then sell them under his father&#x27;s signature. In the wide landscapes he often reprised compositions of his father but executed them in a different palette. Among his veduta paintings can be counted a &quot;View of the palace of Brussels with Archdukes Albert and Isabella&quot; (c. 1627, Museo del Prado) executed in collaboration with Sebastiaen Vrancx.

In his village landscapes Jan initially followed his father&#x27;s precedent and gradually developed his own idiom in the 1640s.

===Still lifes===
A less prolific flower painter than his father, he was inspired by his father&#x27;s works on which he produced his variations. His flower pieces are usually executed on a smaller scale and are less compact, slimmer and less detailed.

His father had created the new still life category of garland paintings, a special type of still life developed in Antwerp along with other artists such as Hendrick van Balen, Frans Francken the Younger, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. These paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. This genre was initially inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. Jan also painted various garland paintings in collaboration with other artists. They show the influence of Daniel Seghers. An example is the &quot;Nicolaas de Man in the grounds of his country estate&quot; in which the portrait was painted by Jan Thomas van Ieperen and the landscape by Lucas van Uden (Christie&#x27;s London auction of 6 December 2018 lot 26).

===Allegorical paintings===

Like his father, Jan the Elder produced various sets of allegorical paintings, in particular on the themes of the &quot;Five senses&quot;, the &quot;Four Elements&quot;. These paintings were often collaborations with other painters such as is the case with the five paintings representing the &quot;Five senses&quot; on which Brueghel and Pieter van Avont collaborated and of which an &quot;Allegory of Smell&quot; was auctioned at Dorotheum on 18 December 2017. Another recurring allegorical theme also treated by his father is &quot;Abundance&quot;. An example is the &quot;Allegory of abundance&quot; (c. 1624, Museo del Prado&quot;) in which fertility is represented by a six-breasted figure at the centre of the composition.

He gradually developed his own themes and style for his allegorical subjects. From the 1640s he created complex allegories dealing with subjects such as the horrors of war and the benefits of commerce, the arts and science. In particular the subject of the horrors of war occupied Jan Brueghel in the 1640s, when Europe was emerging from the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The long-hoped-for end of the war was achieved by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. A work made against this background is the &quot;Allegory of war&quot; (Lempertz 16 November 2013, Cologne Lot 1243). The work is full of symbols of war and strife such as weapons, fighting animals, zodiac symbols of bad luck in the heavens, the furies, a burning city, the god of war and the battling troops in the background which all evoke the theme of the horrors of war. In these mature works Jan Brueghel the Younger distanced himself from his father&#x27;s models to create his own visual language, reflecting the new art and mood of his time.

===Singeries===
Jan Breughel the Elder had contributed to the development of the genre of the &#x27;monkey scene&#x27;, also called &#x27;singerie&#x27; (a word, which in French means a &#x27;comical grimace, behaviour or trick&#x27;). Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish painting in the 16th century and was subsequently further developed in the 17th century. Monkeys appear in medieval cathedral sculpture as symbols of evil, while in Renaissance art they were a personification of man. Monkeys were regarded as shameless and impish creatures and excellent imitators of human behaviour. These depictions of monkeys enacting various human roles were a playful metaphor for all the folly in the world. Painters could use the figure of the monkey to express moral judgement and dubious traits of human behaviour.
The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced singeries as an independent theme around 1575 through a series of prints, which were strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated causing the theme to be picked up by other Flemish artists. The Antwerp artist Frans Francken the Younger was the first one to do so. He was quickly followed by Jan Brueghel the Elder, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Jan van Kessel the Elder. Jan Brueghel the Elder&#x27;s son-in-law David Teniers the Younger later became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. Later in the 17th century Nicolaes van Verendael painted these &#x27;monkey scenes&#x27; as well.

Jan Brueghel the Younger also practised this genre. An example is his &quot;Allegory of Tulipomania&quot; or &quot;Satire of Tulipomania&quot; of which he painted at least four versions, of which three place the scene outdoors and one situates it in a loggia. The painting mocks the obsession of Dutch society with the trade and speculation in tulips. A lively trade in tulips and tulip bulbs had developed in the Dutch Republic with prices rising to unprecedented levels. Speculation was rife, resulting in big profits and big losses. Brueghel&#x27;s &quot;Satire of Tulipomania&quot; pokes fun at the tulip traders. The version in the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem shows monkeys negotiating, weighing bulbs, counting money and handling administrative tasks. The monkey on the left holds a list of bulb prices. On the right, a monkey is urinating on tulips, thus mocking this tulip mania.

<doc id="64393" wikidata="Q643802" url="?curid=64393" title="Video game crash of 1983">
<text>The video game crash of 1983 (known in Japan as the Atari shock) was a large-scale recession in the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985 in the United States. The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of video game consoles and available games, many of which were of poor quality. Waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers also played a role. Home video game revenue peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. To a lesser extent, the arcade video game market also weakened as the golden age of arcade video games came to an end.

Lasting about two years, the crash shook a then-booming video game industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software.

The North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of Nintendo&#x27;s Western branding for its Famicom console, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), released in October 1985. The NES was designed to avoid the missteps that caused the 1983 crash and the stigma associated with video games at that time.

== Causes and factors ==
=== Flooded console market ===
The Atari VCS (renamed the Atari 2600 in late 1982) was not the first home system with swappable game cartridges, but by 1980 it was the most popular second-generation console by a wide margin. Launched in 1977 just ahead of the collapse of the market for home &quot;Pong&quot; console clones, the Atari VCS experienced modest sales for its first few years. In 1980, Atari&#x27;s licensed version of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; from Taito became the console&#x27;s killer application; sales of the VCS quadrupled, and the game was the first title to sell more than a million copies. Spurred by the success of the Atari VCS, other consoles were introduced, both from Atari and other companies: Odyssey², Intellivision, ColecoVision, Atari 5200, and Vectrex. Notably, Coleco sold an add-on allowing Atari VCS games to be played on its ColecoVision, as well as bundling the console with a licensed home version of Nintendo&#x27;s arcade hit &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. In 1982, the ColecoVision held roughly 17% of the hardware market, compared to Atari VCS&#x27; 58%. This was the first real threat to Atari&#x27;s dominance of the home console market.

Each new console had its own library of games produced exclusively by the console maker, while the Atari VCS also had a large selection of titles produced by third-party developers. In 1982, analysts marked trends of saturation, mentioning that the amount of new software coming in would only allow a few big hits, that retailers had devoted too much floor space to systems, and that price drops for home computers could result in an industry shakeup. Atari had a large inventory after significant portions of the 1982 orders were returned.

In addition, the rapid growth of the video game industry led to an increased demand, which the manufacturers over-projected. In 1983, an analyst for Goldman Sachs stated the demand for video games was up 100% from the previous year, but the manufacturing output had increased by 175%, creating a significant surplus. Atari CEO Raymond Kassar recognized in 1982 that the industry&#x27;s saturation point was imminent. However, Kassar expected this to occur when about half of American households had a video game console. The crash occurred when about 15 million machines had been sold, which soundly under-shot Kassar&#x27;s estimate. Michael Katz, the president of Atari&#x27;s electronic division, stated that the console market was too saturated as 30 million consoles were sold by 1982, out of the 35 million households with children between the ages of six and sixteen.

=== Loss of publishing control ===
Prior to 1979, there were no third-party developers, with console manufacturers like Atari publishing all the games for their respective platforms. This changed with the formation of Activision in 1979. Activision was founded by four former Atari video game programmers who left the company because they felt that Atari&#x27;s developers should receive the same recognition and accolades (specifically in the form of sales-based royalties and public-facing credits) as the actors, directors, and musicians working for other subsidiaries of Warner Communications (Atari&#x27;s parent company at the time). Already being quite familiar with the Atari VCS, the four programmers developed their own games and cartridge manufacturing processes. Atari quickly sued to block sales of Activision&#x27;s products but failed to secure a restraining order, and they ultimately settled the case in 1982. While the settlement stipulated that Activision pay royalties to Atari, this case ultimately legitimized the viability of third-party game developers. Activision&#x27;s games were as popular as Atari&#x27;s, with &quot;Pitfall!&quot; (released in 1982) selling over 4 million units.

Prior to 1982, Activision was one of only a handful of third parties publishing games for the Atari VCS. By 1982, Activision&#x27;s success emboldened numerous other competitors to penetrate the market. However, Activision&#x27;s founder David Crane observed that several of these companies were supported by venture capitalists attempting to emulate the success of Activision. Without the experience and skill of Activision&#x27;s team, these inexperienced competitors mostly created games of poor quality. Crane notably described these as &quot;the worst games you can imagine&quot;. While Activision&#x27;s success could be attributed to the team&#x27;s existing familiarity with the Atari VCS, other publishers had no such advantage.

The rapid growth of the third-party game industry was easily illustrated by the number of vendors present at the semi-annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). According to Crane, the number of third-party developers jumped from 3 to 30 between two consecutive events. At the Summer 1982 CES, there were 17 companies, including MCA Inc. and Fox Video Games, announcing a combined 90 new Atari games. By 1983, an estimated 100 companies were attempting to leverage the CES into a foothold in the market. &quot;AtariAge&quot; documented 158 different vendors that had developed for the Atari VCS. In June 1982, the Atari games on the market numbered just 100 which by December, grew to over 400. Experts predicted a glut in 1983, with only 10% of games producing 75% of sales.

&quot;BYTE&quot; stated in December, &quot;in 1982 few games broke new ground in either design or format ... If the public really likes an idea, it is milked for all its worth, and numerous clones of a different color soon crowd the shelves. That is, until the public stops buying or something better comes along. Companies who believe that microcomputer games are the hula hoop of the 1980s only want to play Quick Profit.&quot; Bill Kunkel said in January 1983 that companies had &quot;licensed everything that moves, walks, crawls, or tunnels beneath the earth. You have to wonder how tenuous the connection will be between the game and the movie &quot;Marathon Man&quot;. What are you going to do, present a video game root canal?&quot; By September 1983, the &quot;Phoenix&quot; stated that 2600 cartridges were &quot;no longer a growth industry&quot;. Activision, Atari, and Mattel all had experienced programmers, but many of the new companies rushing to join the market did not have the expertise or talent to create quality games. Titles such as the &quot;Kaboom!&quot;-like &quot;Lost Luggage&quot;, rock band tie-in &quot;Journey Escape&quot;, and plate-spinning game &quot;Dishaster&quot;, were examples of games made in the hopes of taking advantage of the video-game boom, but later proved unsuccessful with retailers and potential customers.

The flood of new games was released into a limited competitive space. According to Activision&#x27;s Jim Levy, they had projected that the total cartridge market in 1982 would be around 60 million, anticipating Activision would be able to secure between 12% and 15% of that market for their production numbers. However, with at least 50 different companies in the new marketspace, and each having produced between one and two million cartridges, along with Atari&#x27;s own estimated 60 million cartridges in 1982, there was over 200% production of the actual demand for cartridges in 1982, which contributed to the stockpiling of unsold inventory during the crash.

=== Competition from home computers ===

Inexpensive home computers had been first introduced in 1977. By 1979, Atari, Inc. unveiled the Atari 400 and 800 computers, built around a chipset originally meant for use in a game console, and which retailed for the same price as their respective names. In 1981, IBM introduced the first IBM Personal Computer with a $1,565 base price (), while Sinclair Research introduced its low-end ZX81 microcomputer for £70 (). By 1982, new desktop computer designs were commonly providing better color graphics and sound than game consoles and personal computer sales were booming. The TI-99/4A and the Atari 400 were both at $349 (), the TRS-80 Color Computer sold at $379 (), and Commodore International had just reduced the price of the VIC-20 to $199 () and the Commodore 64 to $499 ().

Because computers generally had more memory and faster processors than a console, they permitted more sophisticated games. A 1984 compendium of reviews of Atari 8-bit software used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all other software types. Home computers could also be used for tasks such as word processing and home accounting. Games were easier to distribute, since they could be sold on floppy disks or cassette tapes instead of ROM cartridges. This opened the field to a cottage industry of third-party software developers. Writeable storage media allowed players to save games in progress, a useful feature for increasingly complex games which was not available on the consoles of the era.

In 1982, a price war that began between Commodore and Texas Instruments led to home computers becoming as inexpensive as video-game consoles; after Commodore cut the retail price of the C64 to $300 in June 1983, some stores began selling it for as little as $199. Dan Gutman, founder in 1982 of &quot;Video Games Player&quot; magazine in an article in 1987, recalled in 1983 that &quot;People asked themselves, &#x27;Why should I buy a video game system when I can buy a computer that will play games and do so much more?&#x27;&quot; &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; stated in September 1983 about the cancellation of the Intellivision III, &quot;Who was going to pay $200-plus for a machine that could only play games?&quot; Commodore explicitly targeted video game players. Spokesman William Shatner asked in VIC-20 commercials &quot;Why buy just a video game from Atari or Intellivision?&quot;, stating that &quot;unlike games, it has a real computer keyboard&quot; yet &quot;plays great games too&quot;. Commodore&#x27;s ownership of chip fabricator MOS Technology allowed manufacture of integrated circuits in-house, so the VIC-20 and C64 sold for much lower prices than competing home computers. In addition, both Commodore computers were designed to utilize the ubiquitous Atari controllers so they could tap into the existing controller market.

&quot;I&#x27;ve been in retailing 30 years and I have never seen any category of goods get on a self-destruct pattern like this&quot;, a Service Merchandise executive told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in June 1983. The price war was so severe that in September Coleco CEO Arnold Greenberg welcomed rumors of an IBM &#x27;Peanut&#x27; home computer because although IBM was a competitor, it &quot;is a company that knows how to make money&quot;. &quot;I look back a year or two in the videogame field, or the home-computer field&quot;, Greenberg added, &quot;how much better everyone was, when most people were making money, rather than very few&quot;. Companies reduced production in the middle of the year because of weak demand even as prices remained low, causing shortages as sales suddenly rose during the Christmas season; only the Commodore 64 was widely available, with an estimated more than 500,000 computers sold during Christmas. The 99/4A was such a disaster for TI, that the company&#x27;s stock immediately rose by 25% after the company discontinued it and exited the home-computer market in late 1983. JCPenney announced in December 1983 that it would soon no longer sell home computers, because of the combination of low supply and low prices. Radio Shack avoided drastic price cuts for its home computers and remained profitable in 1983.

By that year, Gutman wrote, &quot;Video games were officially dead and computers were hot&quot;. He renamed his magazine &quot;Computer Games&quot; in October 1983, but &quot;I noticed that the word &quot;games&quot; became a dirty word in the press. We started replacing it with &quot;simulations&quot; as often as possible&quot;. Soon &quot;The computer slump began ... Suddenly, everyone was saying that the home computer was a fad, just another hula hoop&quot;. &quot;Computer Games&quot; published its last issue in late 1984. In 1988, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; founder Russell Sipe noted that &quot;the arcade game crash of 1984 took down the majority of the computer game magazines with it.&quot; He stated that, by &quot;the winter of 1984, only a few computer game magazines remained&quot;, and by mid-1985, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; &quot;was the only 4-color computer game magazine left&quot;.

== Immediate effects ==
With the release of so many new games in 1982 that flooded the market, most stores had insufficient space to carry new games and consoles. As stores tried to return the surplus games to the new publishers, the publishers had neither new products nor cash to issue refunds to the retailers. Many publishers, including Games by Apollo and U.S. Games, quickly folded. Unable to return the unsold games to defunct publishers, stores marked down the titles and placed them in discount bins and sale tables. Recently released games which initially sold for US$35 (equivalent to $99 in 2021) were in bins for $5 ($14 in 2021).

The presence of third-party sales drew the market share that the console manufacturers had. Atari&#x27;s share of the cartridge-game market fell from 75% in 1981 to less than 40% in 1982, which negatively affected their finances. The bargain sales of poor-quality titles further drew sales away from the more successful third-party companies like Activision due to poorly informed consumers being drawn by price to purchase the bargain titles rather than quality. By June 1983, the market for the more expensive games had shrunk dramatically and was replaced by a new market of rushed-to-market, low-budget games. Crane said that &quot;those awful games flooded the market at huge discounts, and ruined the video game business&quot;.

A massive industry shakeout resulted. Magnavox abandoned the video game business entirely. Imagic withdrew its IPO the day before its stock was to go public; the company later collapsed. Activision had to downsize across 1984 and 1985 due to loss of revenue, and to stay competitive and maintain financial security, began development of games for the personal computer. Within a few years, Activision no longer produced cartridge-based games and focused solely on personal computer games.
Atari was one of those companies most affected by the crash. As a company, its revenue dropped significantly due to dramatically lower sales and cost of returned stock. By mid-1983, the company had lost , was forced to lay off 30% of its 10,000 employees, and moved all manufacturing to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Unsold &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, and other 1982 and 1983 games and consoles started to fill their warehouses. In September 1983, Atari discreetly buried much of this excess stock in a landfill near Alamogordo, New Mexico, though Atari did not comment about their activity at the time. Misinformation related to sales of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot; led to the urban legend of the Atari video game burial, that millions of unsold cartridges were buried there. Gaming historians received permission to dig up the landfill as part of a documentary in 2014, during which former Atari executive James Heller, who had overseen the original burial clarified that only about 728,000 cartridges had been buried in 1982, backed by estimates made during the excavation, and disproving the scale of the urban legend. Atari&#x27;s burial remains an iconic representation of the 1983 video game crash. By the end of 1983, Atari had over in losses, leading to Warner Communication to sell Atari&#x27;s consumer products division in July 1984 to Jack Tramiel, who had recently departed Commodore International. Tramiel&#x27;s new company took the name Atari Corporation, and they directed their efforts into developing their new personal computer line, the Atari ST, over the console business.

Lack of confidence in the video game sector caused many retailers to stop selling video game consoles or reduced their stock significantly, reserving floor or shelf space for other products. Retailers established to exclusively sell video games folded, which impacted sales of personal computer games.
The full effects of the industry crash were not felt until 1985. Despite Atari&#x27;s claim of 1 million in worldwide sales of its 2600 game system that year, recovery was slow. The sales of home video games had dropped from $3.2 billion in 1982 to $100 million in 1985. Analysts doubted the long-term viability of the video game industry, and, according to Electronic Arts&#x27; Trip Hawkins, it had been very difficult to convince retailers to carry video games due to the stigma carried by the fall of Atari until 1985.

Two major events of 1985 helped to revitalize the video game industry. One factor came from increased sales of personal computers from Commodore and Tandy, which helped to maintain revenue for game developers like Activision and Electronic Arts, keeping the video game market alive. The other was the initial limited release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in late 1985, followed by the full national release early the following year. Following 1986, the industry began recovering, and by 1988, annual sales in the industry exceeded $2.3 billion, with 70% of the market dominated by Nintendo. In 1986, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi noted that &quot;Atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom to third-party developers and the market was swamped with rubbish games&quot;. In response, Nintendo limited the number of titles that third-party developers could release for their system each year, and promoted its &quot;Seal of Quality&quot;, which it allowed to be used on games and peripherals by publishers that met Nintendo&#x27;s quality standards.

The end of the crash allowed Commodore to raise the price of the C64 for the first time upon the June 1986 introduction of the Commodore 64c—a Commodore 64 redesigned for lower cost of manufacture—which &quot;Compute!&quot; cited as the end of the home-computer price war, one of the causes of the crash.

== Long-term effects ==

The crash in 1983 had the largest impact in the United States. It rippled through all sectors of the global video game market worldwide, though sales of video games still remained strong in Japan, Europe, and Canada from the beleaguered American companies. It took several years for the U.S. industry to recover. The estimated worldwide market in 1982, including arcade, console, and computer games, dropped to by 1985. There was also a significant shift in the home video game market, away from consoles to personal computer software, between 1983 and 1985.

1984 is when some of the longer-term effects started to take a toll on the video game console. Companies like Magnavox had decided to pull out of the video game console industry. The general consensus was that video games were just a fad that came as quickly as they left. But outside of North America the video game industry was doing very well. Home consoles were growing in popularity in Japan while home computers were surging across Europe.

United States sales fell from $3 billion to around $100 million in 1985. During the holiday season of 1985 Hiroshi Yamauchi decided to go to New York small markets about putting their products in their stores. Minoru Arakawa offered a money back guarantee from Nintendo that they would pay back for any stock that was left unsold. In total Nintendo sold 50,000 units, about half of the units they shipped to the US.

=== Japanese domination ===
The U.S. video game crash had two long-lasting results. The first result was that dominance in the home console market shifted from the United States to Japan. The crash did not directly affect the financial viability of the video game market in Japan, but it still came as a surprise there and created repercussions that changed that industry, and thus became known as the &quot;Atari shock&quot;.

Prior to the crash, Jonathan Greenberg of &quot;Forbes&quot; had predicted in early 1981 that Japanese companies would eventually dominate the North American video game industry, as American video game companies were increasingly licensing products from Japanese companies, who in turn were opening up North American branches. By 1982–1983, Japanese manufacturers had captured a large share of the North American arcade market, which Gene Lipkin of Data East USA partly attributed to Japanese companies having more finances to invest in new ideas.

As the crash was happening in the United States, Japan&#x27;s game industry started to shift its attention from arcade games to home consoles. Within one month in 1983, two new home consoles were released in Japan: the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) and Sega&#x27;s SG-1000 (which was later supplanted by the Master System) heralding the third generation of home consoles retrospectively. These two consoles were very popular, buoyed by an economic bubble in Japan. The units readily outsold Atari and Mattel&#x27;s existing systems, and with both Atari and Mattel focusing on recovering domestic sales, the Japanese consoles effectively went uncontested over the next few years. By 1986, three years after its introduction, 6.5 million Japanese homes – 19% of the population – owned a Famicom, and Nintendo began exporting it to the U.S., where the home console industry was only just recovering from the crash.
The impact on the retail sector of the crash was the most formidable barrier that confronted Nintendo as it tried to market the Famicom in the United States. A planned deal with Atari to distribute the Famicom in North America fell apart in the wake of the crash, resulting in Nintendo handling the international release themselves two years later. Additionally, retailer opposition to video games was directly responsible for causing Nintendo to brand its product the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) rather than a &quot;video game system&quot;, and using terms such as &quot;control deck&quot; and &quot;Game Pak&quot;, as well as producing a toy robot called R.O.B. to convince toy retailers to allow it in their stores. Furthermore, the design for the NES used a front-loading cartridge slot to mimic how video cassette recorders, popular at that time, were loaded, further pulling the NES away from previous console designs.
By the time the U.S. video game market recovered in the late 1980s, the NES was by far the dominant console in the United States, leaving only a fraction of the market to Atari. By 1989, home video game sales in the United States had reached $5 billion, surpassing the 1982 peak of $3 billion during the previous generation. A large majority of the market was controlled by Nintendo; it sold more than 35 million units in the United States, exceeding the sales of other consoles and personal computers by a considerable margin. New Japanese companies entered the market to challenge Nintendo&#x27;s success in the United States, NEC&#x27;s TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis, both released in the U.S. in 1989. While the TurboGrafx underwhelmed in the market, the Genesis&#x27; release set the stage for a major rivalry between Sega and Nintendo in the early 1990s in the United States video game market.

=== Impact on third-party software development ===
A second, highly visible result of the crash was the advancement of measures to control third-party development of software. Using secrecy to combat industrial espionage had failed to stop rival companies from reverse engineering the Mattel and Atari systems and hiring away their trained game programmers. While Mattel and Coleco implemented lockout measures to control third-party development (the ColecoVision BIOS checked for a copyright string on power-up), the Atari 2600 was completely unprotected and once information on its hardware became available, little prevented anyone from making games for the system. Nintendo thus instituted a strict licensing policy for the NES that included equipping the cartridge and console with lockout chips, which were region-specific, and had to match in order for a game to work. In addition to preventing the use of unlicensed games, it also was designed to combat software piracy, rarely a problem in North America or Western Europe, but rampant in East Asia. The concepts of such a control system remain in use on every major video game console produced today, even with fewer cartridge-based consoles on the market than in the 8/16-bit era. Replacing the security chips in most modern consoles are specially encoded optical discs that cannot be copied by most users and can only be read by a particular console under normal circumstances. Accolade achieved a technical victory in one court case against Sega, challenging this control, even though it ultimately yielded and signed the Sega licensing agreement. Several publishers, notably Tengen (Atari Games), Color Dreams, and Camerica, challenged Nintendo&#x27;s control system during the 8-bit era by producing unlicensed NES games.

Initially, Nintendo was the only developer for the Famicom. Under pressure from Namco and Hudson Soft, it opened the Famicom to third-party development, but instituted a license fee of 30% per game cartridge for these third-parties to develop games, a system used by console manufacturers to this day. Nintendo maintained strict manufacturing control and requiring payment in full before manufacturing. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the financial risk of selling all units ordered. Nintendo limited most third-party publishers to only five games per year on its systems (some companies tried to get around this by creating additional company labels like Konami&#x27;s Ultra Games label). Nintendo ultimately dropped this rule by 1993, after the release of the successor Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo&#x27;s strong-armed oversight of Famicom cartridge manufacturing led to both legitimate and bootleg unlicensed cartridges to be made in the Asian regions. Outside of Japan, Nintendo placed its Nintendo Seal of Quality on all licensed games released for the system to try to promote authenticity and detract from bootleg sales, but failed to make significant traction to stalling these sales.

As Nintendo prepared to release the Famicom in the United States, it wanted to avoid both the bootleg problem it had in Asia as well as the mistakes that led up to the 1983 crash. The company created the proprietary 10NES system, a lockout chip which was designed to prevent cartridges made without the chip from being played on the NES. The 10NES lockout was not perfect, as later in the NES&#x27; lifecycle methods were found to bypass it, but it did sufficiently allow Nintendo to strengthen its publishing control to avoid the mistakes Atari had made and initially prevent bootleg cartridges in the Western markets. These strict licensing measures backfired somewhat after Nintendo was accused of monopolistic behavior. In the long run, this pushed many western third-party publishers such as Electronic Arts away from Nintendo consoles and supported competing consoles such as the Sega Genesis or Sony PlayStation. Most of the Nintendo platform-control measures were adopted by later console manufacturers such as Sega, Sony, and Microsoft, although not as stringently.

=== Computer game growth ===
With waning console interests in the United States, the computer game market was able to gain a strong foothold in 1983 and beyond. Developers that had been primarily in the console games space, like Activision, turned their attention to developing computer game titles to stay viable. Newer companies also were founded to capture the growing interest in the computer games space with novel elements that borrowed from console games, as well as taking advantage of low-cost dial-up modems that allowed for multiplayer capabilities. The computer game market grew between 1983 and 1984, overtaking the console market, but overall video game revenue had declined significantly due to the considerable decline of the console market as well as the arcade market to an extent. The home computer industry, however, experienced a downturn in mid-1984, with global computer game sales declining in 1985 to a certain extent.

Microcomputers dominated the European market throughout the 1980s and with domestic production for those formats thriving over the same period, there was minimal trans-Atlantic ripple from American game production and trends. Partly as a distant knock-on effect of the crash and partly due to the continuing quality of homegrown computer and microcomputer games, consoles did not achieve a dominant position in some European markets until the early 1990s. In the United Kingdom, there was a short-lived home console market between 1980 and 1982, but the 1983 crash led to the decline of consoles in the UK, which was offset by the rise of LCD games in 1983 and then the rise of computer games in 1984. It was not until the late 1980s with the arrival of the Master System and NES that the home console market recovered in the UK. Computer games remained the dominant sector of the UK home video game market up until they were surpassed by Sega and Nintendo consoles in 1991.

<text>Goodfellas (stylized as GoodFellas) is a 1990 American biographical gangster film directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese, and produced by Irwin Winkler. It is a film adaptation of Pileggi&#x27;s 1985 nonfiction book &quot;Wiseguy&quot;. Starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino, the film narrates the rise and fall of Mafia associate Henry Hill and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980.

Scorsese initially titled the film &quot;Wise Guy&quot; and postponed making it; he and Pileggi later changed the title to &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. To prepare for their roles in the film, De Niro, Pesci and Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.

&quot;Goodfellas&quot; premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival on September 9, 1990, where Scorsese was awarded with the Silver Lion award for Best Director, and was released in the United States on September 19, 1990, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film grossed $47 million against a budget of $25 million and received widespread acclaim upon release; the critical consensus on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes calls it &quot;arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s career&quot;. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, with Pesci winning Best Supporting Actor. The film also won five awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, including Best Film and Best Director, and was named the year&#x27;s best film by various critics&#x27; groups.

&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, particularly in the gangster genre. In 2000, it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other pieces of media.

== Plot ==

In 1955, Henry Hill becomes enamored by the criminal life and Mafia presence in his working-class Italian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn. He begins working for local &quot;caporegime&quot; Paulie Cicero and his associates Jimmy Conway, an Irish-American truck hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as a fence for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes.

Through the 1960s, the three men get into carjacking, stealing cargo trucks out of JFK Airport, and eventually commit the Air France Robbery. They spend most of their nights at the Copacabana nightclub, carousing with women. Henry starts dating Karen Friedman, a Jewish woman who is initially confused by Henry&#x27;s criminal activities. She is then seduced by Henry&#x27;s glamorous lifestyle, and marries him, despite her parents&#x27; disapproval.

In 1970, Billy Batts, a made man in the Gambino crime family recently released from prison, insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry. In response, Tommy and Jimmy beat, stab, and fatally shoot Billy. Realizing that the unsanctioned murder of a made man would invite retribution, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy bury the body in Upstate New York. Six months later, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decaying corpse.

In 1974, Karen harasses Henry&#x27;s mistress, Janice, and threatens Henry at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in Tampa with Jimmy. Upon returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the gambler&#x27;s sister, an FBI typist, and receive ten-year prison sentences. To support his family on the outside, Henry has Karen smuggle in drugs from Pittsburgh, which he sells to fellow inmates.

Four years later, Henry is paroled and expands his cocaine business with Jimmy and Tommy, against Paulie&#x27;s orders. Jimmy organizes a crew to raid the Lufthansa vault at JFK Airport, stealing six million dollars in cash and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy&#x27;s orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew killed. Only Henry and Tommy survive, as Henry is making money through his Pittsburgh connection, and Tommy is to become a made man. However, in 1979, Tommy is killed when he arrives at the ceremony, in retribution for murdering Batts.

By 1980, Henry has become a nervous wreck after using cocaine. He sets up another drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates, but is arrested by narcotics agents and incarcerated. After bailing him out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry&#x27;s drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200 and ends their association. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner and is asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request makes him suspicious. Realizing that Jimmy also plans to have him killed, Henry finally decides to become an informant and enroll, with his family, into the witness protection program. Henry gives sufficient testimony and evidence in court to have Paulie and Jimmy convicted, and moves to a nondescript neighborhood in accordance with the witness protection program. Henry describes his unhappiness in leaving his exciting and turbulent gangster life, now being condemned to live the rest of his life as a boring, average &quot;schnook&quot;.

== Cast ==

==Production==
===Development===

&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is based on New York crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi&#x27;s book &quot;Wiseguy&quot;. Martin Scorsese did not intend to make another Mafia film, but he saw a review of Pileggi&#x27;s book, which he then read while working on &quot;The Color of Money&quot; in 1986. He had always been fascinated by the mob lifestyle and was drawn to Pileggi&#x27;s book because he thought it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. After reading the book, Scorsese knew what approach he wanted to take: &quot;To begin &quot;Goodfellas&quot; like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. I think it&#x27;s the only way you can really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of why a lot of people are attracted to it.&quot; According to Pileggi, Scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for this book my entire life,&quot; to which Pileggi replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for this phone call my entire life.&quot;

Scorsese decided to postpone making the film when funds materialized in 1988 to make &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. He was drawn to the documentary aspects of Pileggi&#x27;s book. &quot;The book [&quot;Wiseguy&quot;] gives you a sense of the day-to-day life, the tedium, how they work, how they take over certain nightclubs, and for what reasons. It shows how it&#x27;s done.&quot; He saw &quot;Goodfellas&quot; as the third film in an unplanned trilogy of films that examined the lives of Italian Americans &quot;from slightly different angles.&quot; He has often described the film as &quot;a mob home movie&quot; that is about money, because &quot;that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re really in business for.&quot; Two weeks in advance of the filming, the real Henry Hill was paid $480,000.

=== Screenplay ===
Scorsese and Pileggi collaborated on the screenplay, and over the course of the 12 drafts it took to reach the ideal script, the reporter realized &quot;the visual styling had to be completely redone... So we decided to share credit.&quot; They chose the sections of the book they liked and put them together like building blocks. Scorsese persuaded Pileggi that they did not need to follow a traditional narrative structure. Scorsese wanted to take the gangster film and deal with it episode by episode, but start in the middle and move backwards and forwards. Scorsese compacted scenes, realizing that, if they were kept short, &quot;the impact after about an hour and a half would be terrific.&quot; He wanted to use narration in a manner reminiscent of François Truffaut&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; and use &quot;all the basic tricks of the New Wave from around 1961.&quot; This was the first time since &quot;Mean Streets&quot; that Scorsese was credited as a co-writer.

The names of several real-life gangsters were altered for the film; Tommy &quot;Two Gun&quot; DeSimone became Tommy DeVito, Paul Vario became Paulie Cicero, and Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; Burke became Jimmy Conway, after Burke&#x27;s birth surname. Scorsese initially titled the film &quot;Wise Guy&quot;, but later, he and Pileggi decided to change the title of their film to &quot;Goodfellas&quot; because two contemporary projects, the 1986 Brian De Palma film &quot;Wise Guys&quot; and the 1987–1990 TV series &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, had used similar titles.

=== Casting ===
Once Robert De Niro agreed to play Jimmy Conway, Scorsese was able to secure the money needed to make the film. Ray Liotta, who played Henry Hill, had read Pileggi&#x27;s book when it came out and was fascinated by it. A couple of years afterward, his agent told him Scorsese was going to direct a film adaptation. In 1988, Liotta met Scorsese over a period of a couple of months and auditioned for the film. He campaigned aggressively for a role, though Warner Bros. wanted a well-known actor; he later said, &quot;I think they would&#x27;ve rather had Eddie Murphy than me.&quot; Scorsese cast Liotta after De Niro saw him in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986); Scorsese was surprised by &quot;his explosive energy&quot; in that film. Al Pacino and John Malkovich were considered for the role of Conway, and Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, Val Kilmer, and Tom Cruise were considered for the role of Hill.

To prepare for the role, De Niro consulted with Pileggi, who had research material that had been discarded while writing the book. De Niro often called Hill several times a day to ask how Burke walked, held his cigarette, and so on. Driving to and from the set, Liotta listened to FBI audio cassette tapes of Hill, so he could practice speaking like his real-life counterpart. Madonna was considered for the role of Karen Hill. To research her role, Lorraine Bracco tried to get close to a mob wife but was unable to due to the insular nature of Mafia communities. She decided not to meet the real Karen, saying she &quot;thought it would be better if the creation came from me.&quot; Paul Sorvino had no problem finding the voice and walk of his character, but found it challenging to find what he called &quot;that kernel of coldness and absolute hardness that is antithetical to my nature except when my family is threatened.&quot;

Former EDNY prosecutor Edward A. McDonald appeared in the film as himself, re-creating the conversation he had with Henry and Karen Hill about joining the Witness Protection Program. McDonald, who was friends with Pileggi, was cast on a whim; while a location scout was taking pictures of his office, McDonald casually remarked that he would be happy to play himself if needed. Pileggi called him an hour later asking if he was serious, and he was cast. The scene was unscripted, with McDonald improvising the line referring to Karen as a &quot;babe-in-the-woods.&quot;

=== Photography ===
The film was shot on location in Queens, Upstate New York, New Jersey, and parts of Long Island during the spring and summer of 1989, with a budget of $25 million. Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and storyboarded everything because of the complicated style throughout. The filmmaker stated, &quot;[I] wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by [Henry&#x27;s] last day as a wise guy, it&#x27;s as if the whole picture would be out of control, give the impression he&#x27;s just going to spin off the edge and fly out.&quot; He added that the film&#x27;s style came from the opening scenes of &quot;Jules and Jim&quot;: extensive narration, quick edits, freeze frames, and multiple locale switches. It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, &quot;So if you do the movie, you say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t care if there&#x27;s too much narration. Too many quick cuts?—That&#x27;s too bad.&#x27; It&#x27;s that kind of really punk attitude we&#x27;re trying to show.&quot; He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information. He also put plenty of detail in every frame because he believed the gangster life is so rich. Freeze-frames were used for certain scenes because Scorsese wanted to highlight that &quot;a point was being reached&quot; in Henry&#x27;s life.

Joe Pesci did not judge his character, but found the scene where he kills Spider hard to do until he forced himself to feel the way Tommy did. Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because of the male-dominated cast, and realized if she did not make her &quot;work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor.&quot; When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.

According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography. For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him—the &quot;Funny how? Do I amuse you?&quot; scene—is based on an actual event that Pesci experienced. Pesci was working as a waiter when he thought he was making a compliment to a mobster by saying he was &quot;funny&quot;; however, the comment was not taken well. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script. The dinner scene with Tommy&#x27;s mother (portrayed by Scorsese&#x27;s mother, Catherine) was also improvised, with the only scripted line being, &quot;Did Tommy tell you about my painting?&quot; Tommy&#x27;s mother&#x27;s painting of the bearded man with the dogs was painted by Nicholas Pileggi&#x27;s mother and based on a photograph from the November 1978 edition of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine. The cast did not meet Henry Hill until a few weeks before the film&#x27;s premiere. Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.

The long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission to go in the short way, and this forced them to go round the back. Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry&#x27;s entire life was ahead of him, commenting, &quot;It&#x27;s his seduction of her [Karen] and it&#x27;s also the lifestyle seducing him.&quot; This sequence was shot eight times, not due to camera errors but as Henny Youngman messed up his lines.

Henry&#x27;s last day as a criminal was the hardest part of the film for Scorsese to shoot, because he wanted to properly show Henry&#x27;s state of anxiety and paranoia caused by cocaine and amphetamine use. In an interview with film critic Mark Cousins, Scorsese explained the reason for Pesci shooting at the camera at the end of the film: &quot;well that&#x27;s a reference right to the end of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;...and basically the plot of this picture is very similar to &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;. It hasn&#x27;t changed, 90 years later, it&#x27;s the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he&#x27;s always going to look behind his back, he&#x27;s gotta have eyes behind his back, because they&#x27;re gonna get him someday.&quot; The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wise guy, about which Scorsese said that &quot;I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they do—and maybe with the system which allows this.&quot;

=== Post-production ===
Scorsese wanted to depict the film&#x27;s violence realistically, &quot;cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental.&quot; However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an R rating from the MPAA. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; was Scorsese&#x27;s most expensive film to that point but still only a medium-sized budget by Hollywood standards. It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner to preview the film. At two preview screenings in California, audiences were &quot;agitated&quot; by the sequence depicting Henry&#x27;s final day as a gangster, which Scorsese argued was his and editor Thelma Schoonmaker&#x27;s intention. In the first test screening, forty audience members walked out in the first ten minutes. One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the &quot;Funny like a clown? Do I amuse you?&quot; scene.

=== Soundtrack ===

While there is no incidental score as such in the film, Scorsese chose songs for the soundtrack that he felt obliquely commented on the scene or the characters. In a given scene, he used only music contemporary to or older than the scene&#x27;s setting. According to Scorsese, many of the non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had &quot;Layla&quot; by Derek and the Dominos playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car, dumpster, and meat truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action. Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script, while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.

=== Critical response ===
According to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 164 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 9.00/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Hard-hitting and stylish, &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is a gangster classic—and arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s career.&quot; Metacritic has assigned the film a weighted average score of 92 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars and wrote, &quot;No finer film has ever been made about organized crime – not even &quot;The Godfather&quot;.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Gene Siskel wrote, &quot;All of the performances are first-rate; Pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is easily one of the year&#x27;s best films.&quot; Both named it as the best film of 1990. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;More than any earlier Scorsese film, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is memorable for the ensemble nature of the performances... The movie has been beautifully cast from the leading roles to the bits. There is flash also in some of Mr. Scorsese&#x27;s directorial choices, including freeze frames, fast cutting and the occasional long tracking shot. None of it is superfluous.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and called it, &quot;great cinema—and also a whopping good time.&quot; David Ansen, in his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, wrote &quot;Every crisp minute of this long, teeming movie vibrates with outlaw energy.&quot; Rex Reed said, &quot;Big, rich, powerful and explosive. One of Scorsese&#x27;s best films! &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is great entertainment.&quot; In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;So it is Scorsese&#x27;s triumph that &quot;GoodFellas&quot; offers the fastest, sharpest 2½-hr. ride in recent film history.&quot;

=== Lists ===
The film was ranked the best of 1990 by Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel, and Peter Travers. In a poll of 80 film critics, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; was named the best film of the year by 34 critics. Director Martin Scorsese was chosen as the year&#x27;s best director in 45 of the 80 ballots.

&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is ranked No. 92 on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list, published in 2007. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed &quot;Goodfellas&quot; as the fifteenth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership. In the 2012 Sight &amp; Sound polls, it was ranked the 48th-greatest film ever made in the directors&#x27; poll. In the subsequent 2022 polls, it was ranked 28th in the directors&#x27; poll and tied for 63rd (with &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;The Third Man&quot;) in the critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is 39th on James Berardinelli&#x27;s 2014-made list of the top 100 films of all time. In 2015, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; ranked 20th on BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest American Films&quot; list, voted on by film critics from around the world.

==Accolades==
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is 1 of 8 films to have won Best Picture from three out of the four major U.S. film critics&#x27; groups (LA, NY, and NSFC, in its case) along with &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, &quot;Terms of Endearment,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;The Hurt Locker,&quot; &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, and &quot;Tár&quot;.
== Legacy ==
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is No. 94 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years, 100 Movies&quot; list and moved up to No. 92 on its AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) from 2007. In June 2008, the AFI put &quot;Goodfellas&quot; at No. 2 on their AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the movie-related community. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; was regarded as the second-best in the gangster film genre (after &quot;The Godfather&quot;). In 2000, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

Roger Ebert named &quot;Goodfellas&quot; the &quot;best mob movie ever&quot; and placed it among the ten best films of the 1990s. In December 2002, a UK film critics poll in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; ranked the film No. 4 on their list of the 10 Best Films of the Last 25 Years. &quot;Time&quot; included &quot;Goodfellas&quot; in their list of Time&#x27;s All-Time 100 Movies. &quot;Channel 4&quot; placed &quot;Goodfellas&quot; at No. 10 in their 2002 poll &quot;The 100 Greatest Films&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot; listed &quot;Goodfellas&quot; at No. 6 on their &quot;500 Greatest Movies Of All Time,&quot; and &quot;Total Film&quot; voted &quot;Goodfellas&quot; No. 1 as the greatest film of all time.

&quot;Premiere&quot; listed Joe Pesci&#x27;s Tommy DeVito as No. 96 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time,&quot; calling him &quot;perhaps the single most irredeemable character ever put on film.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; ranked Tommy DeVito No. 59 in their &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; poll.

&quot;Goodfellas&quot; inspired director David Chase to make the HBO television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He told Peter Bogdanovich, &quot;&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a very important movie to me and &quot;Goodfellas&quot; really plowed that ... I found that movie very funny and brutal and it felt very real. And yet that was the first mob movie that Scorsese ever dealt with a mob crew. ... as opposed to say &quot;The Godfather&quot; ... which there&#x27;s something operatic about it, classical, even the clothing and the cars. You know I mean I always think about &quot;Goodfellas&quot; when they go to their mother&#x27;s house that night when they&#x27;re eating, you know when she brings out her painting, that stuff is great. I mean &quot;The Sopranos&quot; learned a lot from that.&quot; Indeed, the film shares a total of 27 actors with &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, including Bracco, Sirico, Imperioli, Pellegrino, Lip, and Vincent, who all had major roles in Chase&#x27;s HBO series.

July 24, 2010, marked the 20th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release. This milestone was celebrated with Henry Hill hosting a private screening for a select group of invitees at the Museum of the American Gangster, in New York City.

In January 2012, it was announced that the AMC Network had put a television series version of the movie in development. Pileggi was on board to co-write the adaptation with television writer-producer Jorge Zamacona. The two were set to executive produce with the film&#x27;s producer Irwin Winkler and his son, David.

Luc Besson&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;The Family&quot; features a sequence where Giovanni Manzoni (De Niro), a gangster who is under witness protection for testifying against a member of his family, watches &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;

In 2014, the ESPN-produced &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary series debuted &quot;Playing for the Mob&quot;, depicting the point shaving scandal orchestrated by Hill, his Pittsburgh associates, and several Boston College men&#x27;s basketball players during the 1978–79 season. The episode was narrated by Liotta and contains references to &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; closed the Tribeca Film Festival with a screening of its 25th-anniversary remaster.

In 2020, AMC began including a content warning when airing &quot;Goodfellas:&quot; “This film includes language and/or cultural stereotypes that are inconsistent with today’s standards of inclusion and tolerance and may offend some viewers.” By comparison, &quot;The Godfather&quot; gets a standard &quot;viewer discretion&quot; warning.

==Notes==

Of note are the differences between the movie and what happened in real life. Although the movie is mostly true, there are still a few slight differences. For instance, Thomas DeSimone, who Tommy DeVito is based on, was much taller, younger, and muscular. Also, although the real Billy Batts probably did insult Tommy and make remarks about shining his shoes, the real reason Tommy attacked him was that Jimmy Burke wanted to take over his loan-shark business in Queens.. 
The movie had its behind-the-scenes featuerette premiere in the Spring of 1990 on Cinemax, on &quot;Beyond the Screen,&quot; hosted by Matt Lauer and many other hosts.

<text>Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; D&#x27;Amico is the name of two recurring characters in the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Both are voiced by Joe Mantegna and first appeared in the episode &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot; of the third season. Fat Tony is a mobster and the underboss of the Springfield Mafia. His henchmen include Legs, Louie, and Johnny Tightlips, and he reports to Don Vittorio DiMaggio. Upon the death of the original Fat Tony in the episode &quot;Donnie Fatso&quot; of the twenty-second season, the character&#x27;s near-identical cousin of the same name is introduced. The characters somewhat resemble real-life mobster Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno.

==Profile==
===First Fat Tony===
The original Fat Tony, full name Marion Anthony D&#x27;Amico, was the chief racketeer behind several of Springfield&#x27;s criminal enterprises, covering a wide range of rackets which included illegal gambling, cigarette smuggling, bootlegging, fraud, and making and selling fake IDs. In &quot;The Twisted World of Marge Simpson&quot;, Homer contracts with the mafia to drive out Marge&#x27;s rival snack food distributors. Fat Tony took out a hit on Mayor Quimby in &quot;Mayored to the Mob&quot; in retaliation for a raid on their rat milk facility, which Quimby opposed, as they had promised him &quot;dog or higher&quot;. Fat Tony puts out a contract on Homer after his private security business interferes with the mob&#x27;s interests in &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot;. Homer would have been executed gangland-style if not for Maggie coming to the rescue with her rifle. Fat Tony&#x27;s son Michael is first mentioned by Fat Tony as he is talking to Marge in &quot;The Seven-Beer Snitch&quot;, saying she drove him home from school sometimes. He is then properly introduced in the episode &quot;The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer&quot;. The episode also reveals that Fat Tony&#x27;s wife &quot;was whacked by &#x27;natural causes&#x27;.&quot; Fat Tony and his associates meet in what is known as the &quot;Legitimate Businessman&#x27;s Social Club&quot;. Fat Tony played the violin in &quot;Insane Clown Poppy&quot;.

===Second Fat Tony===
The original Fat Tony dies in the twenty-second season episode &quot;Donnie Fatso&quot; from a heart attack, with his final words to Homer being &quot;I loved you man.&quot; Shortly afterwards, he is replaced by his slimmer cousin Anthony Paul D&#x27;Amico, initially nicknamed &quot;Fit Tony&quot;. By the end of that episode, Tony has taken to stress eating as a way of dealing with the numerous attempts on his life, and the resulting weight gain causes a change of nickname to &quot;Fit-Fat Tony&quot; and eventually &quot;Fat Tony&quot;, essentially restoring the status quo from before the first Fat Tony died. This iteration of Fat Tony, although similar in character to the original, does have notable differences in his appearance such as lighter skin, darker hair, and wearing a red polo shirt instead of a teal one.

In &quot;The Real Housewives of Fat Tony&quot;, he supposedly marries Selma Bouvier, but the relationship falls apart when Selma discovers Tony only held a ceremony to make her his goomar as he is already married to another woman.

==Name==
The original Fat Tony&#x27;s actual name is the source of some dispute, as several different real names have been revealed over the course of the series. In the third-season episode &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot;, Fat Tony is referred to in a news report given by Kent Brockman as William &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Williams, presumably an alias. In the eighth-season episode &quot;The Homer They Fall&quot;, the announcer at Homer&#x27;s boxing match against Drederick Tatum refers to Fat Tony as Anthony D&#x27;Amico (incidentally the name of one of the three Re-Recording Mixers in the end credits), which he is called later as well, for example, by the FBI. In the twelfth-season episode &quot;Insane Clown Poppy&quot;, Frankie the Squealer claims that Fat Tony&#x27;s first name is Marion, a reference to actor John Wayne&#x27;s real name, Marion Robert Morrison.

==Character==
===Development===
Fat Tony first appeared in the third season episode &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot;. The writers conceived the episode before the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, which has a similar plot, was released. However, when it was, the writers incorporated references to the film in the episode. Fat Tony was modeled on Paul Sorvino, who played mobster Paul Cicero in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. The appearance of Louie, one of Tony&#x27;s henchmen, was based on another &quot;Goodfellas&quot; actor, Frank Sivero. The end of the episode portrays a TV movie about the events depicted in the episode, in which Joe Mantegna will play Fat Tony (this was before it was decided that Fat Tony would be a recurring character). In the episode &quot;Donnie Fatso&quot;, Fat Tony dies of a heart attack; his cousin Fit Tony takes his place as head of the syndicate, but soon becomes known as Fat Tony due to stress-induced overeating.

===Voice===
The writers originally wanted Sheldon Leonard to voice Fat Tony. When they were unable to get him, they cast Joe Mantegna. It is his longest-running role. Mantegna said, &quot;You feel honored that they asked you to do a voice. The fact that they bring you back and keep writing for the character, it is very satisfying.&quot; Mantegna based his raspy voice for Fat Tony on his Uncle Willy, a long-standing cigarette smoker. He insists that the producers must &quot;not let anyone else do his noises,&quot; even going so far as to say, &quot;If Fat Tony sneezes, I want to be there.&quot; This is referenced in the season 20 episode &quot;Sex, Pies, and Idiot Scrapes, where the script required only grunting. Despite this, Phil Hartman voiced the character in the season 7 episode &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;. Mantegna voiced Fat Tony in a scene in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; that almost got cut. Of the Fat Tony episodes, Mantegna favors &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot; and &quot;The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer&quot;, because they are the character&#x27;s first appearance and a season premiere.

==Reception==
IGN ranked Fat Tony at No. 18 on their 2006 list of the &quot;Top 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; Peripheral Characters&quot;. Star News Online listed Joe Mantegna as one of the 400 reasons why they love &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In 2007, Adam Finley of TV Squad called Mantegna one of the five best &quot;The Simpsons&quot; guest stars and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot; the eighth best episode of the show, saying, &quot;This episode makes the cut because of the inspired Mafia satire&quot;. Playmates Toys made Fat Tony into an action figure as part of the World of Springfield toy line.

<text>Edward Benjamin Britten, Baron Britten (22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976) was an English composer, conductor, and pianist. He was a central figure of 20th-century British music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; (1945), the &quot;War Requiem&quot; (1962) and the orchestral showpiece &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot; (1945).

Britten was born in Lowestoft, Suffolk, the son of a dentist. He showed talent from an early age. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London and privately with the composer Frank Bridge. Britten first came to public attention with the &quot;a cappella&quot; choral work &quot;A Boy Was Born&quot; in 1934. With the premiere of &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in 1945, he leapt to international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Covent Garden, he wrote chamber operas for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; (1954). Recurring themes in his operas include the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society and the corruption of innocence.

Britten&#x27;s other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot;, a &quot;Missa Brevis&quot;, and the song collection &quot;Friday Afternoons&quot;. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears; others included Kathleen Ferrier, Jennifer Vyvyan, Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian Bream, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Osian Ellis and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot;, Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann.

Together with Pears and the librettist and producer Eric Crozier, Britten founded the annual Aldeburgh Festival in 1948, and he was responsible for the creation of Snape Maltings concert hall in 1967. In 1976, he was the first composer to be given a life peerage. He died shortly afterwards, aged 63.

==Early years==

Britten was born in the fishing port of Lowestoft in Suffolk, on the east coast of England on 22 November 1913, the feast day of Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music. He was the youngest of four children of Robert Victor Britten (1877–1934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, &quot;née&quot; Hockey (1874–1937). Robert Britten&#x27;s youthful ambition to become a farmer had been thwarted by lack of capital, and he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at Charing Cross Hospital in London he met Edith Hockey, the daughter of a civil service clerk in the British Government&#x27;s Home Office. They were married in September 1901 at St John&#x27;s, Smith Square, London.

The consensus among biographers of Britten is that his father was a loving but somewhat stern and remote parent. Britten, according to his sister Beth, &quot;got on well with him and shared his wry sense of humour, dedication to work and capacity for taking pains.&quot; Edith Britten was a talented amateur musician and secretary of the Lowestoft Musical Society. In the English provinces of the early 20th century, distinctions of social class were taken very seriously. Britten described his family as &quot;very ordinary middle class&quot;, but there were aspects of the Brittens that were not ordinary: Edith&#x27;s father was illegitimate, and her mother was an alcoholic; Robert Britten was an agnostic and refused to attend church on Sundays. Music was the principal means by which Edith Britten strove to maintain the family&#x27;s social standing, inviting the pillars of the local community to musical soirées at the house.

When Britten was three months old he contracted pneumonia and nearly died. The illness left him with a damaged heart, and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life. He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer. To his mother&#x27;s great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father&#x27;s indifference to music, while his brother, Robert, though musically talented, was interested only in ragtime. Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five. He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the viola. He was one of the last composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.

==Education==

===Lowestoft===
When he was seven Britten was sent to a dame school, run by the Misses Astle. The younger sister, Ethel, gave him piano lessons; in later life he said that he remained grateful for the excellence of her teaching. The following year he moved on to a prep school, South Lodge, Lowestoft, as a day boy. The headmaster, Thomas Sewell, was an old-fashioned disciplinarian; the young Britten was outraged at the severe corporal punishments frequently handed out, and later he said that his lifelong pacifism probably had its roots in his reaction to the regime at the school. He himself rarely fell foul of Sewell, a mathematician, in which subject Britten was a star pupil. The school had no musical tradition, and Britten continued to study the piano with Ethel Astle. From the age of ten he took viola lessons from a friend of his mother, Audrey Alston, who had been a professional player before her marriage. In his spare time he composed prolifically. When his &quot;Simple Symphony&quot;, based on these juvenilia, was recorded in 1956, Britten wrote this pen-portrait of his young self for the sleeve note:
Audrey Alston encouraged Britten to go to symphony concerts in Norwich. At one of these, during the triennial Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1924, he heard Frank Bridge&#x27;s orchestral poem &quot;The Sea&quot;, conducted by the composer. It was the first substantial piece of modern music he had ever encountered, and he was, in his own phrase, &quot;knocked sideways&quot; by it. Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her not quite 14-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten&#x27;s compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him. Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his public school the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague Harold Samuel.

Bridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing and the maxim that &quot;you should find yourself and be true to what you found.&quot; The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the &quot;Quatre Chansons Françaises&quot;, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge&#x27;s influence on his pupil&#x27;s technique. Humphrey Carpenter and Michael Oliver judge that Britten&#x27;s abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught; Donald Mitchell considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.

===Public school and Royal College of Music===

In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham&#x27;s School, in Holt, Norfolk. At the time he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being separated from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though he was not the target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930 he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college&#x27;s harmony and counterpoint teacher, S. P. Waddington.

Britten was at the RCM from 1930 to 1933, studying composition with Ireland and piano with Arthur Benjamin. He won the Sullivan Prize for composition, the Cobbett Competition for chamber music, and was twice winner of the Ernest Farrar Prize for composition. Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students &quot;amateurish and folksy&quot; and the staff &quot;inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere.&quot; Another Ireland pupil, the composer Humphrey Searle, said that Ireland could be &quot;an inspiring teacher to those on his own wavelength&quot;; Britten was not, and learned little from him. He continued to study privately with Bridge, although he later praised Ireland for &quot;nurs[ing] me very gently through a very, very difficult musical adolescence.&quot;

Britten also used his time in London to attend concerts and become better acquainted with the music of Stravinsky, Shostakovich and, most particularly, Mahler. He intended postgraduate study in Vienna with Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s student, but was eventually dissuaded by his parents, on the advice of the RCM staff.

The first of Britten&#x27;s compositions to attract wide attention were composed while at the RCM: the Sinfonietta, Op. 1 (1932), the oboe quartet &quot;Phantasy&quot;, Op. 2, dedicated to Léon Goossens who played the first performance in a BBC broadcast on 6 August 1933, and a set of choral variations &quot;A Boy was Born&quot;, written in 1933 for the BBC Singers, who first performed it the following year. In this same period he wrote &quot;Friday Afternoons&quot;, a collection of 12 songs for the pupils of Clive House School, Prestatyn, where his brother was headmaster.

== Career ==
===Early professional life===
In February 1935, at Bridge&#x27;s instigation, Britten was invited to a job interview by the BBC&#x27;s director of music Adrian Boult and his assistant Edward Clark. Britten was not enthusiastic about the prospect of working full-time in the BBC music department and was relieved when what came out of the interview was an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, &quot;The King&#x27;s Stamp&quot;, directed by Alberto Cavalcanti for the GPO Film Unit.
Britten became a member of the film unit&#x27;s small group of regular contributors, another of whom was W. H. Auden. Together they worked on the documentary films &quot;Coal Face&quot; and &quot;Night Mail&quot; in 1935. They also collaborated on the song cycle &quot;Our Hunting Fathers&quot; (1936), radical both in politics and musical treatment, and subsequently other works including &quot;Cabaret Songs&quot;, &quot;On This Island&quot;, &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot; and &quot;Hymn to St Cecilia&quot;. Auden was a considerable influence on Britten, encouraging him to widen his aesthetic, intellectual and political horizons, and also to come to terms with his homosexuality. Auden was, as David Matthews puts it, &quot;cheerfully and guiltlessly promiscuous&quot;; Britten, puritanical and conventional by nature, was sexually repressed.

In the three years from 1935 to 1937 Britten wrote nearly 40 scores for the theatre, cinema and radio. Among the film music of the late 1930s Matthews singles out &quot;Night Mail&quot; and &quot;Love from a Stranger&quot; (1937); from the theatre music he selects for mention &quot;The Ascent of F6&quot; (1936), &quot;On the Frontier&quot; (1938), and &quot;Johnson Over Jordan&quot; (1939); and of the music for radio, &quot;King Arthur&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1939).

In 1937 there were two events of huge importance in Britten&#x27;s life: his mother died, and he met the tenor Peter Pears. Although Britten was extraordinarily devoted to his mother and was devastated at her death, it also seems to have been something of a liberation for him. Only after that did he begin to engage in emotional relationships with people his own age or younger. Later in the year he got to know Pears while they were both helping to clear out the country cottage of a mutual friend who had died in an air crash. Pears quickly became Britten&#x27;s musical inspiration and close (though for the moment platonic) friend. Britten&#x27;s first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, a setting of Emily Brontë&#x27;s poem, &quot;A thousand gleaming fires&quot;, for tenor and strings.

During 1937 Britten composed a &quot;Pacifist March&quot; to words by Ronald Duncan for the Peace Pledge Union, of which, as a pacifist, he had become an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn. The best known of his compositions from this period is probably &quot;Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge&quot; for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten&#x27;s works to become a popular classic. It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including John Barbirolli and Serge Koussevitzky.

===America 1939–42===
In April 1939 Britten and Pears sailed to North America, going first to Canada and then to New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, including the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that &quot;Frank Bridge&quot; had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten&#x27;s music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten&#x27;s death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and were told that they should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy&#x27;s counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.

Already a friend of the composer Aaron Copland, Britten encountered his latest works &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; and &quot;An Outdoor Overture&quot;, both of which influenced his own music. In 1940 Britten composed &quot;Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo&quot;, the first of many song cycles for Pears. Britten&#x27;s orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto, &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot;, and &quot;An American Overture&quot;. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot;, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden. While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese gamelan music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee&#x27;s transcriptions for a recording. This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten&#x27;s career.

Moving to the US did not relieve Britten of the nuisance of hostile criticism: although both Olin Downes, the doyen of New York music critics, and Irving Kolodin took to Britten&#x27;s music, Virgil Thomson was, as the music scholar Suzanne Robinson puts it, consistently &quot;severe and spiteful&quot;. Thomson described &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; (1940) as &quot;little more than a series of bromidic and facile &#x27;effects&#x27; ... pretentious, banal and utterly disappointing&quot;, and was equally unflattering about Pears&#x27;s voice. Robinson surmises that Thomson was motivated by &quot;a mixture of spite, national pride, and professional jealousy.&quot; &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot; met with wholesale critical disapproval, and the &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot; (already rejected by its Japanese sponsors because of its overtly Christian nature) received a mixed reception when Barbirolli and the New York Philharmonic premiered it in March 1941. The reputation of the work was much enhanced when Koussevitzky took it up shortly afterwards.

===Return to England===

In 1942 Britten read the work of the poet George Crabbe for the first time. &quot;The Borough&quot;, set on the Suffolk coast close to Britten&#x27;s homeland, awakened in him such longings for England that he knew he must return. He also knew that he must write an opera based on Crabbe&#x27;s poem about the fisherman Peter Grimes. Before Britten left the US, Koussevitzky, always generous in encouraging new talent, offered him a $1,000 commission to write the opera. Britten and Pears returned to England in April 1942. During the long transatlantic sea crossing Britten completed the choral works &quot;A Ceremony of Carols&quot; and &quot;Hymn to St Cecilia&quot;. The latter was his last large-scale collaboration with Auden. Britten had grown away from him, and Auden became one of the composer&#x27;s so-called &quot;corpses&quot; – former intimates from whom he completely cut off contact once they had outlived their usefulness to him or offended him in some way.

Having arrived in Britain, Britten and Pears applied for recognition as conscientious objectors; Britten was initially allowed only non-combatant service in the military, but on appeal he gained unconditional exemption. After the death of his mother in 1937 he had used money she bequeathed him to buy the Old Mill in Snape, Suffolk which became his country home. He spent much of his time there in 1944 working on the opera &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;. Pears joined Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company, whose artistic director, the singer Joan Cross, announced her intention to re-open the company&#x27;s home base in London with Britten&#x27;s opera, casting herself and Pears in the leading roles. There were complaints from company members about supposed favouritism and the &quot;cacophony&quot; of Britten&#x27;s score, as well as some ill-suppressed homophobic remarks. &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; opened in June 1945 and was hailed by public and critics; its box-office takings matched or exceeded those for &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, which were staged during the same season. The opera administrator Lord Harewood called it &quot;the first genuinely successful British opera, Gilbert and Sullivan apart, since Purcell.&quot; Dismayed by the in-fighting among the company, Cross, Britten and Pears severed their ties with Sadler&#x27;s Wells in December 1945, going on to found what was to become the English Opera Group.

A month after the opening of &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give recitals to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused to talk about it until towards the end of his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle &quot;The Holy Sonnets of John Donne&quot; and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as &quot;Les Illuminations&quot;. Britten recovered his &quot;joie de vivre&quot; for &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot; (1945), written for an educational film, &quot;Instruments of the Orchestra&quot;, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.

Britten&#x27;s next opera, &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;, was presented at the first post-war Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. It was then taken on tour to provincial cities under the banner of the &quot;Glyndebourne English Opera Company&quot;, an uneasy alliance of Britten and his associates with John Christie, the autocratic proprietor of Glyndebourne. The tour lost money heavily, and Christie announced that he would underwrite no more tours. Britten and his associates set up the English Opera Group; the librettist Eric Crozier and the designer John Piper joined Britten as artistic directors. The group&#x27;s express purpose was to produce and commission new English operas and other works, presenting them throughout the country. Britten wrote the comic opera &quot;Albert Herring&quot; for the group in 1947; while on tour in the new work Pears came up with the idea of mounting a festival in the small Suffolk seaside town of Aldeburgh, where Britten had moved from Snape earlier in the year, and which became his principal place of residence for the rest of his life.

===Aldeburgh; the 1950s===
The Aldeburgh Festival was launched in June 1948, with Britten, Pears, and Crozier directing. &quot;Albert Herring&quot; played at the Jubilee Hall, and Britten&#x27;s new cantata for tenor, chorus, and orchestra, &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot;, was presented in the parish church. The festival was an immediate success and became an annual event that has continued into the 21st century. New works by Britten featured in almost every festival until his death in 1976, including the premieres of his operas &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Jubilee Hall in 1960 and &quot;Death in Venice&quot; at Snape Maltings Concert Hall in 1973.
Unlike many leading English composers, Britten was not known as a teacher, but in 1949 he accepted his only private pupil, Arthur Oldham, who studied with him for three years. Oldham made himself useful, acting as musical assistant and arranging &quot;Variations on a Theme by Frank Bridge&quot; for full orchestra for the Frederick Ashton ballet &quot;Le Rêve de Léonor&quot; (1949), but he later described the teacher–pupil relationship as &quot;beneficial five per cent to [Britten] and ninety-five per cent to me!&quot;

Throughout the 1950s Britten continued to write operas. &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1951) was well received at its Covent Garden premiere and was regarded by reviewers as an advance on &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;. &quot;Gloriana&quot; (1953), written to mark the coronation of Elizabeth II, had a cool reception at the gala premiere in the presence of the Queen and the British Establishment &quot;en masse&quot;. The downbeat story of Elizabeth I in her decline, and Britten&#x27;s score – reportedly thought by members of the premiere&#x27;s audience &quot;too modern&quot; for such a gala – did not overcome what Matthews calls the &quot;ingrained philistinism&quot; of the ruling classes. Although &quot;Gloriana&quot; did well at the box office, there were no further productions in Britain for another 13 years. It was later recognised as one of Britten&#x27;s finer operas. &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; the following year was an unqualified success; together with &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; it became, and at 2013 remained, one of the two most frequently performed of Britten&#x27;s operas.

In the 1950s the &quot;fervently anti-homosexual&quot; Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, urged the police to enforce the Victorian laws making homosexual acts illegal. Britten and Pears came under scrutiny; Britten was visited by police officers in 1953 and was so perturbed that he discussed with his assistant Imogen Holst the possibility that Pears might have to enter a sham marriage (with whom is unclear). In the end nothing was done.

An increasingly important influence on Britten was the music of the East, an interest that was fostered by a tour there with Pears in 1956, when Britten once again encountered the music of the Balinese gamelan and saw for the first time Japanese Noh plays, which he called &quot;some of the most wonderful drama I have ever seen.&quot; These eastern influences were seen and heard in the ballet &quot;The Prince of the Pagodas&quot; (1957) and later in two of the three semi-operatic &quot;Parables for Church Performance&quot;: &quot;Curlew River&quot; (1964), &quot;The Burning Fiery Furnace&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1968).

He was invited to a competition to compose the future anthem of the Federation of Malaya (now Malaysia) in 1956. He attempted a composition after several couple of days which he described as &quot;curious&quot; and &quot;unsuccessful&quot;. The committee returned the score with suggestions that he could make it &quot;sound more Malaysian&quot;, but to no avail.

===1960s===
By the 1960s, the Aldeburgh Festival was outgrowing its customary venues, and plans to build a new concert hall in Aldeburgh were not progressing. When redundant Victorian maltings buildings in the village of Snape, six miles inland, became available for hire, Britten realised that the largest of them could be converted into a concert hall and opera house. The 830-seat Snape Maltings hall was opened by the Queen at the start of the twentieth Aldeburgh Festival on 2 June 1967; it was immediately hailed as one of the best concert halls in the country. The hall was destroyed by fire in 1969, but Britten was determined that it would be rebuilt in time for the following year&#x27;s festival, which it was. The Queen again attended the opening performance in 1970.
The Maltings gave the festival a venue that could comfortably house large orchestral works and operas. Britten conducted the first performance outside Russia of Shostakovich&#x27;s Fourteenth Symphony at Snape in 1970. Shostakovich, a friend since 1960, dedicated the symphony to Britten; he was himself the dedicatee of &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;. Two other Russian musicians who were close to Britten and regularly performed at the festival were the pianist Sviatoslav Richter and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten composed his cello suites, &quot;Cello Symphony&quot; and Cello Sonata for Rostropovich, who premiered them at the Aldeburgh Festival.

One of the best known of Britten&#x27;s works, the &quot;War Requiem&quot;, was premiered in 1962. He had been asked four years earlier to write a work for the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral, a modernist building designed by Basil Spence. The old cathedral had been left in ruins by an air-raid on the city in 1940 in which hundreds of people died. Britten decided that his work would commemorate the dead of both World Wars in a large-scale score for soloists, chorus, chamber ensemble and orchestra. His text interspersed the traditional Requiem Mass with poems by Wilfred Owen. Matthews writes, &quot;With the &quot;War Requiem&quot; Britten reached the apex of his reputation: it was almost universally hailed as a masterpiece.&quot; Shostakovich told Rostropovich that he believed it to be &quot;the greatest work of the twentieth century&quot;.

In 1967 the BBC commissioned Britten to write an opera specially for television. &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; was based, like &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, on a ghost story by Henry James. By the 1960s Britten found composition much slower than in his prolific youth; he told the 28-year-old composer Nicholas Maw, &quot;Get as much done now as you can, because it gets much, much more difficult as you grow older.&quot; He did not complete the score of the new opera until August 1970. &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; was first broadcast in Britain in May 1971, when it was also televised in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and Yugoslavia.

===Last years===

In September 1970 Britten asked Myfanwy Piper, who had adapted the two Henry James stories for him, to turn another prose story into a libretto. This was Thomas Mann&#x27;s novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, a subject he had been considering for some time. At an early stage in composition Britten was told by his doctors that a heart operation was essential if he was to live for more than two years. He was determined to finish the opera and worked urgently to complete it before going into hospital for surgery. His long-term colleague Colin Graham wrote:
After the completion of the opera Britten went into the National Heart Hospital and was operated on in May 1973 to replace a failing heart valve. The replacement was successful, but he suffered a slight stroke, affecting his right hand. This brought his career as a performer to an end. While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 and looked after him until his death.

Britten&#x27;s last works include the &quot;Suite on English Folk Tunes &quot;A Time There Was&quot;&quot; (1974); the Third String Quartet (1975), which drew on material from &quot;Death in Venice&quot;; and the dramatic cantata &quot;Phaedra&quot; (1975), written for Janet Baker.

In June 1976, the last year of his life, Britten accepted a life peerage – the first composer so honoured – becoming Baron Britten, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk. After the 1976 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten and Pears travelled to Norway, where Britten began writing &quot;Praise We Great Men&quot;, for voices and orchestra based on a poem by Edith Sitwell. He returned to Aldeburgh in August, and wrote &quot;Welcome Ode&quot; for children&#x27;s choir and orchestra. In November, Britten realised that he could no longer compose. On his 63rd birthday, 22 November, at his request Rita Thomson organised a champagne party and invited his friends and his sisters Barbara and Beth, to say their goodbyes to the dying composer. When Rostropovich made his farewell visit a few days later, Britten gave him what he had written of &quot;Praise We Great Men&quot;.
Britten died of congestive heart failure on 4 December 1976. His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone. The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had made it clear that he wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of Pears. A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

==Personal life and character==
Despite his large number of works on Christian themes, Britten has sometimes been thought of as an agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 he was not sure whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in &quot;Honest to God&quot;. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.

Physically, Britten was never robust. He walked and swam regularly and kept himself as fit as he could, but in his 1992 biography, Carpenter mentions 20 illnesses, a few of them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child&#x27;s view of the world. He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.

Britten was, as he himself acknowledged, notorious for dumping friends and colleagues who either offended him or ceased to be of use to him – his &quot;corpses&quot;. The conductor Sir Charles Mackerras believed that the term was invented by Lord Harewood. Both Mackerras and Harewood joined the list of corpses, the former for joking that the number of boys in &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; must have been a delight to the composer, and the latter for an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce from Lady Harewood, which shocked the puritanical Britten. Among other corpses were his librettists Montagu Slater and Eric Crozier. The latter said in 1949, &quot;He has sometimes told me, jokingly, that one day I would join the ranks of his &#x27;corpses&#x27; and I have always recognized that any ordinary person must soon outlive his usefulness to such a great creative artist as Ben.&quot; Dame Janet Baker said in 1981, &quot;I think he was quite entitled to take what he wanted from others ... He did not want to hurt anyone, but the task in hand was more important than anything or anybody.&quot; Matthews feels that this aspect of Britten has been exaggerated, and he observes that the composer sustained many deep friendships to the end of his life.

===Controversies===

====Boys====

Throughout his adult life, Britten had a particular rapport with children and enjoyed close friendships with several boys, particularly those in their early teens. The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, who was 13 years old in 1934, when Britten was aged 20. Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s. Hemmings later said, &quot;In all of the time that I spent with him he never abused that trust&quot;, and Crawford wrote &quot;I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man ... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people. He loved music, and loved youngsters caring about music.&quot;

It was long suspected by several of Britten&#x27;s close associates that there was something exceptional about his attraction to teenage boys: Auden referred to Britten&#x27;s &quot;attraction to thin-as-a-board juveniles ... to the sexless and innocent&quot;, and Pears once wrote to Britten: &quot;remember there are lovely things in the world still – children, boys, sunshine, the sea, Mozart, you and me.&quot; In public, the matter was little discussed during Britten&#x27;s lifetime and much discussed after it. Carpenter&#x27;s 1992 biography closely examined the evidence, as do later studies of Britten, most particularly John Bridcut&#x27;s &quot;Britten&#x27;s Children&quot; (2006), which concentrates on Britten&#x27;s friendships and relationships with various children and adolescents. Some commentators have continued to question Britten&#x27;s conduct, sometimes very sharply. Carpenter and Bridcut conclude that he held any sexual impulses under firm control and kept the relationships affectionate – including bed-sharing, kissing and nude bathing – but strictly platonic.

====Cause of death====

A more recent controversy was the statement in a 2013 biography of Britten by Paul Kildea that the composer&#x27;s heart failure was due to undetected syphilis, which Kildea speculates was a result of Pears&#x27;s promiscuity while the two were living in New York. In response, Britten&#x27;s consultant cardiologist said that, like all the hospital&#x27;s similar cases, Britten was routinely screened for syphilis before the operation, with negative results. He described as &quot;complete rubbish&quot; Kildea&#x27;s allegation that the surgeon who operated on Britten in 1973 would or even could have covered up a syphilitic condition. Kildea continued to maintain, &quot;When all the composer&#x27;s symptoms are considered there can be only one cause.&quot; In &quot;The Times&quot;, Richard Morrison praised the rest of Kildea&#x27;s book, and hoped that its reputation would not be &quot;tarnished by one sensational speculation ... some second-hand hearsay ... presenting unsubstantiated gossip as fact.&quot;

==Music==
===Influences===
Britten&#x27;s early musical life was dominated by the classical masters; his mother&#x27;s ambition was for him to become the &quot;Fourth B&quot; – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: &quot;Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of &quot;Fidelio&quot; for my fourteenth birthday ... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations.&quot; He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms&#x27;s music from time to time, &quot;to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!&quot;

Through his association with Frank Bridge, Britten&#x27;s musical horizons expanded. He discovered the music of Debussy and Ravel which, Matthews writes, &quot;gave him a model for an orchestral sound&quot;. Bridge also led Britten to the music of Schoenberg and Berg; the latter&#x27;s death in 1935 affected Britten deeply. A letter at that time reveals his thoughts on the contemporary music scene: &quot;The real musicians are so few &amp; far between, aren&#x27;t they? Apart from the Bergs, Stravinskys, Schoenbergs &amp; Bridges one is a bit stumped for names, isn&#x27;t one?&quot; – adding, as an afterthought: &quot;Shostakovitch – perhaps – possibly&quot;. By this time Britten had developed a lasting hostility towards the English Pastoral School represented by Vaughan Williams and Ireland, whose work he compared unfavourably with the &quot;brilliant folk-song arrangements of Percy Grainger&quot;; Grainger became the inspiration of many of Britten&#x27;s later folk arrangements. Britten was also impressed by Delius, and thought &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; &quot;delicious&quot; when he heard it in 1931. Also in that year he heard Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, which he found &quot;bewildering and terrifying&quot;, yet at the same time &quot;incredibly marvellous and arresting&quot;. The same composer&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot;, and &quot;Petrushka&quot; were lauded in similar terms. He and Stravinsky later developed a mutual antipathy informed by jealousy and mistrust.

Besides his growing attachments to the works of 20th century masters, Britten – along with his contemporary Michael Tippett – was devoted to the English music of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, in particular the work of Purcell. In defining his mission as a composer of opera, Britten wrote: &quot;One of my chief aims is to try to restore to the musical setting of the English Language a brilliance, freedom and vitality that have been curiously rare since the death of Purcell.&quot; Among the closest of Britten&#x27;s kindred composer spirits – even more so than Purcell – was Mahler, whose Fourth Symphony Britten heard in September 1930. At that time Mahler&#x27;s music was little regarded and rarely played in English concert halls. Britten later wrote of how the scoring of this work impressed him: &quot;... entirely clean and transparent ... the material was remarkable, and the melodic shapes highly original, with such rhythmic and harmonic tension from beginning to end.&quot; He soon discovered other Mahler works, in particular &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;; he wrote to a friend about the concluding &quot;Abschied&quot; of &quot;Das Lied&quot;: &quot;It is cruel, you know, that music should be so beautiful.&quot; Apart from Mahler&#x27;s general influence on Britten&#x27;s compositional style, the incorporation by Britten of popular tunes (as, for example, in &quot;Death in Venice&quot;) is a direct inheritance from the older composer.

===Operas===
The Britten-Pears Foundation considers the composer&#x27;s operas &quot;perhaps the most substantial and important part of his compositional legacy.&quot; Britten&#x27;s operas are firmly established in the international repertoire: according to Operabase, they are performed worldwide more than those of any other composer born in the 20th century, and only Puccini and Richard Strauss come ahead of him if the list is extended to all operas composed after 1900.

The early operetta &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot; stands apart from Britten&#x27;s later operatic works. Philip Brett calls it &quot;a patronizing attempt to evoke the spirit of a nation not his own by W. H. Auden in which Britten was a somewhat dazzled accomplice.&quot; The American public liked it, but the critics did not, and it fell into neglect until interest revived near the end of the composer&#x27;s life.
Britten&#x27;s subsequent operas range from large-scale works written for full-strength opera companies, to chamber operas for performance by small touring opera ensembles or in churches and schools. In the large-scale category are &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; (1945), &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1951), &quot;Gloriana&quot; (1953), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1960) and &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1973). Of the remaining operas, &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot; (1946), &quot;Albert Herring&quot; (1947), &quot;The Little Sweep&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; (1954) were written for small opera companies. &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; (1958), &quot;Curlew River&quot; (1964), &quot;The Burning Fiery Furnace&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1968) were for church performance, and had their premieres at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Orford. The secular &quot;The Golden Vanity&quot; was intended to be performed in schools. &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot;, written for television, was first presented live by the Royal Opera at Covent Garden in 1973, two years after its broadcast premiere.

Music critics have frequently commented on the recurring theme in Britten&#x27;s operas from &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; onward of the isolated individual at odds with a hostile society. The extent to which this reflected Britten&#x27;s perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated. Another recurrent theme is the corruption of innocence, most sharply seen in &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;.

Over the 28 years between &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; and &quot;Death in Venice&quot; Britten&#x27;s musical style changed, as he introduced elements of atonalism – though remaining essentially a tonal composer – and of eastern music, particularly gamelan sounds but also eastern harmonies. In &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; the orchestral scoring varies to fit the nature of each set of characters: &quot;the bright, percussive sounds of harps, keyboards and percussion for the fairy world, warm strings and wind for the pairs of lovers, and lower woodwind and brass for the mechanicals.&quot; In &quot;Death in Venice&quot; Britten turns Tadzio and his family into silent dancers, &quot;accompanied by the colourful, glittering sounds of tuned percussion to emphasize their remoteness.&quot;

As early as 1948 the music analyst Hans Keller, summarising Britten&#x27;s impact on 20th-century opera to that date, compared his contribution to that of Mozart in the 18th century: &quot;Mozart may in some respects be regarded as a founder (a &#x27;second founder&#x27;) of opera. The same can already be said today, as far as the modern British – perhaps not only British – field goes, of Britten.&quot; In addition to his own original operas, Britten, together with Imogen Holst, extensively revised Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot; (1967). Britten&#x27;s Purcell Realizations brought Purcell, who was then neglected, to a wider public, but have themselves been neglected since the dominance of the trend to authentic performance practice. His 1948 revision of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; amounts to a wholesale recomposition, retaining the original melodies but giving them new, highly sophisticated orchestral accompaniments.

===Song cycles===
Throughout his career Britten was drawn to the song cycle form. In 1928, when he was 14, he composed an orchestral cycle, &quot;Quatre chansons françaises&quot;, setting words by Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine. Brett comments that though the work is much influenced by Wagner on the one hand and French mannerisms on the other, &quot;the diatonic nursery-like tune for the sad boy with the consumptive mother in &#x27;L&#x27;enfance&#x27; is entirely characteristic.&quot; After he came under Auden&#x27;s influence Britten composed &quot;Our Hunting Fathers&quot; (1936), ostensibly a protest against fox-hunting but which also alludes allegorically to the contemporary political state of Europe. The work has never been popular; in 1948 the critic Colin Mason lamented its neglect and called it one of Britten&#x27;s greatest works. In Mason&#x27;s view the cycle is &quot;as exciting as &quot;Les Illuminations&quot;, and offers many interesting and enjoyable foretastes of the best moments of his later works.&quot;
The first of Britten&#x27;s song cycles to gain widespread popularity was &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; (1940), for high voice (originally soprano, later more often sung by tenors) with string orchestra accompaniment, setting words by Arthur Rimbaud. Britten&#x27;s music reflects the eroticism in Rimbaud&#x27;s poems; Copland commented of the section &quot;Antique&quot; that he did not know how Britten dared to write the melody. &quot;Antique&quot; was dedicated to &quot;K.H.W.S.&quot;, or Wulff Scherchen, Britten&#x27;s first romantic interest. Matthews judges the piece the crowning masterpiece of Britten&#x27;s early years. By the time of Britten&#x27;s next cycle, &quot;Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo&quot; (1942) for tenor and piano, Pears had become his partner and muse; in Matthews&#x27;s phrase, Britten wrote the cycle as &quot;his declaration of love for Peter&quot;. It too finds the sensuality of the verses it sets, though in its structure it resembles a conventional 19th-century song cycle. Mason draws a distinction between this and Britten&#x27;s earlier cycles, because here each song is self-contained, and has no thematic connection with any of the others.

The &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot; (1943) sets verses by a variety of poets, all on the theme of night-time. Though Britten described the cycle as &quot;not important stuff, but quite pleasant, I think&quot;, it was immediately greeted as a masterpiece, and together with &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; it established him as one of the leading composers of his day. Mason calls it &quot;a beautifully unified work on utterly dissimilar poems, held together by the most superficial but most effective, and therefore most suitable symphonic method. Some of the music is pure word-painting, some of it mood-painting, of the subtlest kind.&quot; Two years later, after witnessing the horrors of Belsen, Britten composed &quot;The Holy Sonnets of John Donne&quot;, a work whose bleakness was not matched until his final tenor and piano cycle a quarter of a century later. Britten&#x27;s technique in this cycle ranges from atonality in the first song to firm tonality later, with a resolute B major chord at the climax of &quot;Death, be not proud&quot;.

&quot;Nocturne&quot; (1958) is the last of the orchestral cycles. As in the &quot;Serenade&quot;, Britten set words by a range of poets, who here include Shakespeare, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson and Wilfred Owen. The whole cycle is darker in tone than the &quot;Serenade&quot;, with pre-echoes of the &quot;War Requiem&quot;. All the songs have subtly different orchestrations, with a prominent obbligato part for a different instrument in each.
Among Britten&#x27;s later song cycles with piano accompaniment is the &quot;Songs and Proverbs of William Blake&quot;, composed for the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. This presents all its poems in a continuous stream of music; Brett writes that it &quot;interleaves a ritornello-like setting of the seven proverbs with seven songs that paint an increasingly sombre picture of human existence.&quot; A Pushkin cycle, &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Echo&quot; (1965), was written for Galina Vishnevskaya, and shows a more robust and extrovert side of the composer. Though written ostensibly in the tradition of European song cycles, it draws atmospherically on the polyphony of south-east Asian music. &quot;Who Are These Children?&quot; (1969), setting 12 verses by William Soutar, is among the grimmest of Britten&#x27;s cycles. After he could no longer play the piano, Britten composed a cycle of Robert Burns settings, &quot;A Birthday Hansel&quot; (1976), for voice and harp.

===Other vocal works===
Nicholas Maw said of Britten&#x27;s vocal music: &quot;His feeling for poetry (not only English) and the inflexions of language make him, I think, the greatest musical realizer of English.&quot; One of the best-known works in which Britten set poetry was the &quot;War Requiem&quot; (1962). It intersperses the Latin requiem mass, sung by soprano and chorus, with settings of works by the First World War poet Wilfred Owen, sung by tenor and baritone. At the end the two elements are combined, as the last line of Owen&#x27;s &quot;Strange meeting&quot; mingles with the &quot;In paradisum&quot; of the mass. Matthews describes the conclusion of the work as &quot;a great wave of benediction [which] recalls the end of the &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot;, and its similar ebbing away into the sea that symbolises both reconciliation and death.&quot; The same year, he composed &quot;A Hymn of St Columba&quot; for choir and organ, setting a poem by the 6th-century saint. Other works for voices and orchestra include the &quot;Missa Brevis&quot; and the &quot;Cantata academica&quot; (both 1959) on religious themes, &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; to a text by Bertolt Brecht about a group of children in wartime Poland, to be performed by children (1969), and the late cantata &quot;Phaedra&quot; (1975), a story of fated love and death modelled on Handel&#x27;s Italian cantatas.

Smaller-scale works for accompanied voice include the five &quot;Canticles&quot;, composed between 1947 and 1974. They are written for a variety of voices (tenor in all five; counter-tenor or alto in II and IV and baritone in IV) and accompaniments (piano in I to IV, horn in III and harp in V). The first, &quot;Canticle I: My beloved is mine and I am his&quot;, is a setting of Francis Quarles&#x27;s 17th-century poem &quot;A Divine Rapture&quot;, and according to Britten was modelled on Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Divine Hymns&quot;. Matthews describes it as one of the composer&#x27;s most serene works, which &quot;ends in a mood of untroubled happiness that would soon become rare in Britten&#x27;s music.&quot; The second Canticle was written in 1952, between &quot;Billy Budd&quot; and &quot;Gloriana&quot;, on the theme of Abraham&#x27;s obedience to Divine Authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son Isaac. &quot;Canticle III&quot; from 1954 is a setting of Edith Sitwell&#x27;s wartime poem &quot;Still Falls the Rain&quot;, composed just after &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; with which it is structurally and stylistically associated. The twelve-note cycle in the first five bars of the piano part of the Canticle introduced a feature that became thereafter a regular part of Britten&#x27;s compositional technique. &quot;Canticle IV: The Journey of the Magi&quot;, premiered in 1971, is based on T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;. It is musically close to &quot;The Burning Fiery Furnace&quot; of 1966; Matthews refers to it as a &quot;companion piece&quot; to the earlier work. The final Canticle was another Eliot setting, his juvenile poem &quot;Death of Saint Narcissus&quot;. Although Britten had little idea of what the poem was about, the musicologist Arnold Whittall finds the text &quot;almost frighteningly apt ... for a composer conscious of his own sickness.&quot; Matthews sees Narcissus as &quot;another figure from [Britten&#x27;s] magic world of dreams and ideal beauty.&quot;

===Orchestral works===
The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, &quot;It is easy, because of the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay insufficient attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres.&quot; Maw said of Britten, &quot;He is one of the 20th century&#x27;s great orchestral composers ... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers.&quot; Among Britten&#x27;s best-known orchestral works are the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge&quot; (1937), the &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot; (1940), the &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot; (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten&#x27;s teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clichés and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale. The Sinfonia moves from an opening &quot;Lacrymosa&quot; filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final &quot;Requiem aeternam&quot;, described by the critic Herbert Glass as &quot;the most uneasy &#x27;eternal rest&#x27; possible&quot;. Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: &quot;less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic.&quot; The &quot;Sea Interludes&quot;, adapted by Britten from the full score of &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between &quot;Dawn&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot;. The commentator Howard Posner observes that there is not a bar in the interludes, no matter how beautiful, that is free of foreboding. &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide&quot;, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra&#x27;s individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work &quot;exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [that] fits well into Britten&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot;.&quot; David Matthews calls it &quot;a brilliant educational exercise.&quot;

Unlike his English predecessors such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams, and composers from mainland Europe whom he admired, including Mahler and Shostakovich, Britten was not a classical symphonist. His youthful &quot;jeux d&#x27;esprit&quot; the &quot;Simple Symphony&quot; (1934) is in conventional symphonic structure, observing sonata form and the traditional four-movement pattern, but of his mature works his &quot;Spring Symphony&quot; (1949) is more a song cycle than a true symphony, and the concertante Cello Symphony (1963) is an attempt to balance the traditional concerto and symphony. During its four movements the Cello Symphony moves from a deeply pessimistic opening to a finale of radiant happiness rare for Britten by this point. The composer considered it &quot;the finest thing I&#x27;ve written.&quot;

The Piano Concerto (1938) was at first criticised for being too light-hearted and virtuoso. In 1945 Britten revised it, replacing a skittish third movement with a more sombre passacaglia that, in Matthews&#x27;s view, gives the work more depth, and makes the apparent triumph of the finale more ambivalent. The Violin Concerto (1939), finished in the first weeks of the World War, has virtuoso elements, but they are balanced by lyrical and elegiac passages, &quot;undoubtedly reflecting Britten&#x27;s growing concern with the escalation of world hostilities.&quot; Neither concerto is among Britten&#x27;s most popular works, but in the 21st century the Violin Concerto, which is technically difficult, has been performed more frequently than before, both in the concert hall and on record, and has enthusiastic performers and advocates, notably violinist Janine Jansen.

Britten&#x27;s incidental music for theatre, film and radio, much of it unpublished, was the subject of an essay by William Mann, published in 1952 in the first detailed critical assessment of Britten&#x27;s music to that date. Of these pieces the music for a radio play, &quot;The Rescue&quot;, by Edward Sackville-West, is praised by the musicologist Lewis Foreman as &quot;of such stature and individual character as to be worth a regular place alongside [Britten&#x27;s] other dramatic scores.&quot; Mann finds in this score pre-echoes of the second act of &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, while Foreman observes that Britten &quot;appears to have made passing allusions to &quot;The Rescue&quot; in his final opera, &quot;Death in Venice&quot;.

===Chamber and instrumental works===
Britten&#x27;s close friendship with Rostropovich inspired the Cello Sonata (1961) and three suites for solo cello (1964–71). String quartets featured throughout Britten&#x27;s composing career, from a student work in 1928 to his Third String Quartet (1975). The Second Quartet, from 1945, was written in homage to Purcell; Mason considered it Britten&#x27;s most important instrumental work to that date. Referring to this work, Keller writes of the ease with which Britten, relatively early in his compositional career, solves &quot;the modern sonata problem – the achievement of symmetry and unity within an extended ternary circle based on more than one subject.&quot; Keller likens the innovatory skill of the Quartet to that of Walton&#x27;s Viola Concerto. The third Quartet was Britten&#x27;s last major work; the critic Colin Anderson said of it in 2007, &quot;one of Britten&#x27;s greatest achievements, one with interesting allusions to Bartók and Shostakovich, and written with an economy that opens out a depth of emotion that can be quite chilling. The &quot;Gemini Variations&quot; (1965), for flute, violin and piano duet, were based on a theme of Zoltán Kodály and written as a virtuoso piece for the 13-year-old Jeney twins, musical prodigies whom Britten had met in Budapest in the previous year. For Osian Ellis, Britten wrote the Suite for Harp (1969), which Joan Chissell in &quot;The Times&quot; described as &quot;a little masterpiece of concentrated fancy&quot;. &quot;Nocturnal after John Dowland&quot; (1963) for solo guitar was written for Julian Bream and has been praised by Benjamin Dwyer for its &quot;semantic complexity, prolonged musical argument, and philosophical depth&quot;.

===Legacy===

Britten&#x27;s fellow composers had divided views about him. To Tippett he was &quot;simply the most musical person I have ever met&quot;, with an &quot;incredible&quot; technical mastery; some contemporaries, however, were less effusive. In Tippett&#x27;s view, Walton and others were convinced that Britten and Pears were leaders of a homosexual conspiracy in music, a belief Tippett dismisses as ridiculous, inspired by jealousy of Britten&#x27;s postwar successes. Leonard Bernstein considered Britten &quot;a man at odds with the world&quot;, and said of his music: &quot;[I]f you hear it, not just listen to it superficially, you become aware of something very dark.&quot; The tenor Robert Tear, who was closely associated with Britten in the latter part of the composer&#x27;s career, made a similar point: &quot;There was a great, huge abyss in his soul ... He got into the valley of the shadow of death and couldn&#x27;t get out.&quot;

In the decade after Britten&#x27;s death, his standing as a composer in Britain was to some extent overshadowed by that of the still-living Tippett. The film-maker Tony Palmer thought that Tippett&#x27;s temporary ascendancy might have been a question of the two composers&#x27; contrasting personalities: Tippett had more warmth and had made fewer enemies. In any event this was a short-lived phenomenon; Tippett adherents such as the composer Robert Saxton soon rediscovered their enthusiasm for Britten, whose audience steadily increased during the final years of the 20th century. Britten has had few imitators; Brett describes him as &quot;inimitable, possessed of ... a voice and sound too dangerous to imitate.&quot; Nevertheless, after his death Britten was lauded by the younger generation of English composers to whom, in the words of Oliver Knussen, he became &quot;a phenomenal father-figure&quot;. Brett believes that he affected every subsequent British composer to some extent: &quot;He is a key figure in the growth of British musical culture in the second half of the 20th century, and his effect on everything from opera to the revitalization of music education is hard to overestimate.&quot;

Whittall believes that one reason for Britten&#x27;s enduring popularity is the &quot;progressive conservatism&quot; of his music. He generally avoided the avant-garde, and did not challenge the conventions in the way that contemporaries such as Tippett did. Perhaps, says Brett, &quot;the tide that swept away serialism, atonality and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been out of step with the times.&quot; Britten defined his mission as a composer in very simple terms: composers should aim at &quot;pleasing people today as seriously as we can&quot;.

==Pianist and conductor==
Britten, though a reluctant conductor and a nervous pianist, was greatly sought after in both capacities. The piano accompanist Gerald Moore wrote in his memoirs about playing at all the main music festivals except for Aldeburgh, because &quot;as the presiding genius there is the greatest accompanist in the world, my services are not needed.&quot; Britten&#x27;s recital partnership with Pears was his best-known collaboration, but he also accompanied Kathleen Ferrier, Rostropovich, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, James Bowman and John Shirley-Quirk, among others. Though usually too nervous to play piano solos, Britten often performed piano duets with Clifford Curzon or Richter, and chamber music with the Amadeus Quartet. The composers whose works, other than his own, he most often played were Mozart and Schubert; the latter, in Murray Perahia&#x27;s view, was Britten&#x27;s greatest idol. As a boy and young man, Britten had intensely admired Brahms, but his admiration waned to nothing, and Brahms seldom featured in his repertory.

Singers and players admired Britten&#x27;s conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough to offer him the musical directorship of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his ability as a conductor and was reluctant to spend too much time performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten&#x27;s repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Scenes from Goethe&#x27;s Faust&quot;; Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; and &quot;Introduction and Allegro&quot;; Holst&#x27;s &quot;Egdon Heath&quot; and short pieces by Percy Grainger.

== Recordings ==
Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, was signed up by a major British recording company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works. Culshaw wrote, &quot;The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason that it did not seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were just trying to make music.&quot;

In May 1943 Britten made his debut in the Decca studios, accompanying Sophie Wyss in five of his arrangements of French folk songs. The following January he and Pears recorded together, in Britten&#x27;s arrangements of British folk songs, and the following day, in duet with Curzon he recorded his &quot;Introduction and Rondo alla burlesca&quot; and &quot;Mazurka elegiaca&quot;. In May 1944 he conducted the Boyd Neel string orchestra, Dennis Brain and Pears in the first recording of the &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot;, which has frequently been reissued, most recently on CD.

Britten&#x27;s first operatic recording was &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, made in January 1955 with the original English Opera Group forces. In 1957 he conducted &quot;The Prince of the Pagodas&quot; in an early stereo recording, supervised by Culshaw. Decca&#x27;s first major commercial success with Britten came the following year, with &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, which has, at 2013, never been out of the catalogues since its first release. From 1958 Britten conducted Decca recordings of many of his operas and vocal and orchestral works, including the &quot;Nocturne&quot; (1959), the &quot;Spring Symphony&quot; (1960) and the &quot;War Requiem&quot; (1963). The last sold in unexpectedly large numbers for a classical set, and thereafter Decca unstintingly made resources available to Culshaw and his successors for Britten recordings. Sets followed of &quot;Albert Herring&quot; (1964), the &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot; (1964), &quot;Curlew River&quot; (1965), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1966), &quot;The Burning Fiery Furnace&quot; (1967), &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1967) and many of the other major works. In 2013, to mark the anniversary of Britten&#x27;s birth, Decca released a set of 65 CDs and one DVD, &quot;Benjamin Britten – Complete Works&quot;. Most of the recordings were from Decca&#x27;s back catalogue, but in the interests of comprehensiveness a substantial number of tracks were licensed from 20 other companies including EMI, Virgin Classics, Naxos, Warner and NMC.

As a pianist and conductor in other composers&#x27; music, Britten made many recordings for Decca. Among his studio collaborations with Pears are sets of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot; and &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;, Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Dichterliebe&quot;, and songs by Haydn, Mozart, Bridge, Ireland, Holst, Tippett and Richard Rodney Bennett. Other soloists whom Britten accompanied on record were Ferrier, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya. As a conductor he recorded a wide range of composers, from Purcell to Grainger. Among his best-known Decca recordings are Purcell&#x27;s &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot;, Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot;, Cantata 151, Cantata 102 and &quot;St John Passion&quot;, Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s last two symphonies.

==Honours, awards and commemorations==
State honours awarded to Britten included appointment as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (Britain) in 1953; Commander of the Royal Order of the Polar Star (Sweden) in 1962; the Order of Merit (Britain) in 1965; and a life peerage (Britain) in July 1976, he took the title &quot;Baron Britten, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk&quot;. He received honorary degrees and fellowships from 19 conservatories and universities in Europe and America. His awards included the Hanseatic Goethe Prize (1961); the Aspen Award, Colorado (1964); the Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s Gold Medal (1964); the Wihuri Sibelius Prize (1965); the Mahler Medal (Bruckner and Mahler Society of America, 1967); the Léonie Sonning Music Prize (Denmark, 1968); the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (1974); and the Ravel Prize (1974). Prizes for individual works included UNESCO&#x27;s International Rostrum of Composers 1961 for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;; and Grammy Awards in 1963 and 1977 for the &quot;War Requiem&quot;.

The Red House, Aldeburgh, where Britten and Pears lived and worked together from 1957 until Britten&#x27;s death in 1976, is now the home of the Britten-Pears Foundation, established to promote their musical legacy. In Britten&#x27;s centenary year his studio at the Red House was restored to the way it was in the 1950s and opened to the public. The converted hayloft was designed and built by H T Cadbury Brown in 1958 and was described by Britten as a &quot;magnificent work&quot;. In June 2013 Dame Janet Baker officially opened the Britten-Pears archive in a new building in the grounds of the Red House. The Benjamin Britten Music Academy in Lowestoft, founded in the composer&#x27;s honour, was completed in 1979; it is an 11–18 co-educational day school, with ties to the Britten-Pears Foundation.
A memorial stone to Britten was unveiled in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey in 1978. There are memorial plaques to him at three of his London homes: 173 Cromwell Road, 45a St John&#x27;s Wood High Street, and 8 Halliford Street in Islington. In April 2013 Britten was honoured by the Royal Mail in the UK, as one of ten people selected as subjects for the &quot;Great Britons&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue.

Other creative artists have celebrated Britten. In 1970 Walton composed &quot;Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten&quot;, based on a theme from Britten&#x27;s Piano Concerto. Works commemorating Britten include &quot;Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten&quot; an orchestral piece written in 1977 by Arvo Pärt, and Sally Beamish&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme of Benjamin Britten&quot;, based on the second Sea Interlude from &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;; she composed the work to mark Britten&#x27;s centenary. Alan Bennett depicts Britten in a 2009 play &quot;The Habit of Art&quot;, set while Britten is composing &quot;Death in Venice&quot; and centred on a fictional meeting between Britten and Auden. Britten was played in the premiere production by Alex Jennings.

Tony Palmer made three documentary films about Britten: &quot;Benjamin Britten &amp; his Festival&quot; (1967); &quot;A Time There Was&quot; (1979); and &quot;Nocturne&quot; (2013). In 2019, Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant&quot;.

In April 2022 a project to commemorate Britten in Lowestoft was launched by the broadcaster and children&#x27;s author Zeb Soanes. A maquette of the intended full-sized statue of Britten as a boy was unveiled by the sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley. , £89,000 of £110,000 target had been raised.

===Centenary===
In September 2012, to mark the composer&#x27;s forthcoming centenary, the Britten-Pears Foundation launched &quot;Britten 100&quot;, a collaboration of leading organisations in the performing arts, publishing, broadcasting, film, academia and heritage. Among the events were the release of a feature film &quot;Benjamin Britten – Peace and Conflict&quot;, and a centenary exhibition at the British Library. The Royal Mint issued a 50-pence piece, to mark the centenary – the first time a composer has featured on a British coin.

Centenary performances of the &quot;War Requiem&quot; were given at eighteen locations in Britain. Opera productions included &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; at Aldeburgh, &quot;Billy Budd&quot; at Glyndebourne, &quot;Death in Venice&quot; by English National Opera, &quot;Gloriana&quot; by The Royal Opera, and &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, &quot;Death in Venice&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; by Opera North. &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; was performed on the beach at Aldeburgh, opening the 2013 Aldeburgh Festival in June 2013, with Steuart Bedford conducting and singers from the Chorus of Opera North and the Chorus of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a remarkable, and surely unrepeatable achievement.&quot;

Internationally, the anniversary was marked by performances of the &quot;War Requiem&quot;, &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; and other works in four continents. In the US the centennial events were described as &quot;coast to coast&quot;, with a Britten festival at Carnegie Hall, and performances at the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and Los Angeles Opera.

<text>Thomas Michael Keneally, AO (born 7 October 1935) is an Australian novelist, playwright, essayist, and actor. He is best known for his historical fiction novel &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;, the story of Oskar Schindler&#x27;s rescue of Jews during the Holocaust, which won the Booker Prize in 1982. The book would later be adapted into Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

== Early life ==
Both Keneally&#x27;s parents (Edmund Thomas Keneally and Elsie Margaret Coyle) were born to Irish fathers in the timber and dairy town of Kempsey, New South Wales, and, though born in Sydney, his early years were also spent in Kempsey. His father, Edmund Thomas Keneally, flew for the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II, then returned to work in a small business in Sydney. By 1942, the family had moved to 7 Loftus Crescent, Homebush, a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney and Keneally was enrolled at Christian Brothers St Patrick&#x27;s College, Strathfield. Shortly after, his brother John was born. Keneally studied Honours English for his Leaving Certificate in 1952, under Brother James Athanasius McGlade, and won a Commonwealth scholarship.

Keneally then entered St Patrick&#x27;s Seminary, Manly, to train as a Catholic priest. Although he was ordained as a deacon while at the seminary, after six years there he left in a state of depression and without ordination in the priesthood. He worked as a Sydney schoolteacher before his success as a novelist and was a lecturer at the University of New England (1968–70).

Keneally was known as &quot;Mick&quot; until 1964 but began using the name Thomas when he started publishing, after advice from his publisher to use his real first name.

==Career==
Keneally&#x27;s first story was published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine in 1962 under the pseudonym Bernard Coyle. By February 2014, he had written over 50 books, including 30 novels. He is particularly famed for his &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1982) (later republished as &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;), the first novel by an Australian to win the Booker Prize and is the basis of the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. He had already been shortlisted for the Booker three times prior to that: 1972 for &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot;, 1975 for &quot;Gossip from the Forest&quot;, and 1979 for &quot;Confederates&quot;.

Many of his novels are reworkings of historical material, although modern in their psychology and style.

Premièred at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre, the play &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot; by Timberlake Wertenbaker is based on Keneally&#x27;s book &quot;The Playmaker&quot;. In it, convicts deported from Britain to the Empire&#x27;s penal colony of Australia perform George Farquhar&#x27;s Restoration comedy &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; set in the English town of Shrewsbury. Artistic Director Max Stafford-Clark wrote about his experiences of staging the plays in repertoire in his book &quot;Letters to George&quot;. 

Keneally has also acted in a handful of films. He had a small role in Fred Schepisi&#x27;s &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; (1978) (based on his own novel) and played Father Marshall in the award-winning film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot; (1976), also by Schepisi.

Keneally was a member of the Literature Board of the Australia Council from 1985 to 1988 and President of the National Book Council from 1985 to 1989.

Keneally was a visiting professor at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) where he taught the graduate fiction workshop for one quarter in 1985. From 1991 to 1995, he was a visiting professor in the writing program at UCI.

In 2006, Peter Pierce, Professor of Australian Literature, James Cook University, wrote:

The Tom Keneally Centre opened in August 2011 at the Sydney Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts, housing Keneally&#x27;s books and memorabilia. The site is used for book launches, readings and writing classes.

Keneally is an ambassador of the Asylum Seekers Centre, a not-for-profit that provides personal and practical support to people seeking asylum in Australia.

==Personal life==
Keneally married Judy Martin, then a nurse, in 1965, and they had two daughters, Margaret and Jane.

Keneally was the founding chairman (1991–93) of the Australian Republic Movement and published a book on the subject &quot;Our Republic&quot; in 1993. Several of his Republican essays appear on the website of the movement. He is also a keen supporter of rugby league football, in particular the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles club of the NRL. In 2004, he gave the sixth annual Tom Brock Lecture. He made an appearance in the 2007 rugby league drama film &quot;The Final Winter&quot;.

In March 2009, the Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, gave an autographed copy of Keneally&#x27;s biography &quot;Lincoln&quot; to President Barack Obama as a state gift.

Keneally&#x27;s nephew Ben is married to the former senior Australian Labor Party Senator, Kristina Keneally. She is also a former Premier of New South Wales and Sky News Australia newscaster.

== &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; ==


Keneally wrote the Booker Prize-winning novel in 1982, inspired by the efforts of Poldek Pfefferberg, a Holocaust survivor. In 1980, Keneally met Pfefferberg in the latter&#x27;s shop, and learning that he was a novelist, Pfefferberg showed him his extensive files on Oskar Schindler, including the original list itself. Keneally was interested, and Pfefferberg became an advisor for the book, accompanying Keneally to Poland where they visited Kraków and the sites associated with the Schindler story. Keneally dedicated &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; to Pfefferberg: &quot;who by zeal and persistence caused this book to be written.&quot; He said in an interview in 2007 that what attracted him to Oskar Schindler was that &quot;it was the fact that you couldn&#x27;t say where opportunism ended and altruism began. And I like the subversive fact that the spirit breatheth where it will. That is, that good will emerge from the most unlikely places&quot;. The book was later made into the movie &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993) directed by Steven Spielberg, earning his first Best Director Oscar. Keneally&#x27;s meeting with Pfefferberg and their research tours are detailed in &quot;Searching for Schindler: A Memoir&quot; (2007).

Some of the Pfefferberg documents that inspired Keneally are now housed in the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney. In 1996 the State Library purchased this material from a private collector.

==Honours==
In 1983, he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO). He is an Australian Living Treasure. Keneally has stated that he was once offered the title of Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and that he refused it. &quot;I said I pitied any empire of which I was a commander&quot;.

In 2010 the Australian postal service issued a stamp in his honour.

Keneally has been awarded honorary doctorates including one from the National University of Ireland.

<text>Christina Stead (17 July 190231 March 1983) was an Australian novelist and short-story writer acclaimed for her satirical wit and penetrating psychological characterisations. Christina Stead was a committed Marxist, although she was never a member of the Communist Party. She spent much of her life outside Australia, although she returned before her death.

==Biography==
Christina Stead&#x27;s father was the marine biologist and pioneer conservationist David George Stead; her mother was his first wife Ellen Butters, who died in 1904. She was born in the Sydney suburb of Rockdale. They lived in Rockdale at Lydham Hall, now operating as a museum. 

Stead later moved with her family to the suburb of Watsons Bay in 1917. She was the only child of her father&#x27;s first marriage, and had five half-siblings from his second marriage. He also married a third time, to Yolette Thistle Harris, the Australian botanist, educator, author, and conservationist. According to some, this house was a hellhole for her because of her &quot;domineering&quot; father. Stead attended Sydney Girls&#x27; High School, to 1919, and went on to Sydney Teachers&#x27; College, leaving in 1922 and becoming a teacher, which did not suit her. In 1925 she determined to become a writer, and worked as a secretary.

In 1928 Stead left Australia, finding work in the London grain company Strauss &amp; Co. managed by Edward Strauss; the American manager William James Blech, later Blake, became an important figure in her life, and they married in 1952. She worked in a Parisian bank from 1930 to 1935. She travelled to Spain with Blake, leaving at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, and to the USA. After Blake&#x27;s death from stomach cancer in 1968, she returned to Australia.

==Works==
Stead wrote 12 novels and published a large number of articles on different subjects in her lifetime. A volume of short stories was published after her death. She taught &quot;Workshop in the Novel&quot; at New York University in 1943 and 1944, and also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter in the 1940s, contributing to the &quot;Madame Curie&quot; biopic and the John Ford and John Wayne war movie, &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;. Her first novel, &quot;Seven Poor Men of Sydney&quot; (1934), dealt with the lives of radicals and dockworkers, but she was not a practitioner of social realism. Stead&#x27;s best-known novel, titled &quot;The Man Who Loved Children,&quot; is largely based on her own childhood, and was first published in 1940. It was not until the poet Randall Jarrell wrote the introduction for a new American edition in 1965 and her New York publisher convinced her to change the setting from Sydney to Washington, that the novel began to receive a larger audience. In 2005, the magazine &quot;Time&quot; included this work in their &quot;100 Best Novels from 1923–2005&quot;, and in 2010 American author Jonathan Franzen hailed the novel as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Stead&#x27;s &quot;Letty Fox: Her Luck&quot;, often regarded as an equally fine novel, was officially banned in Australia for several years because it was considered amoral and salacious.

Stead set one of her two British novels, &quot;Cotters&#x27; England,&quot; partly in Gateshead (called Bridgehead in the novel). She was in Newcastle upon Tyne in the summer of 1949, accompanied by her friend Anne Dooley (née Kelly), a local woman, who was the model for Nellie Cotter, the extraordinary heroine of the book. Anne was no doubt responsible for Stead&#x27;s reasonable attempt at conveying the local accent. Her letters indicate that she had taken on Tyneside speech and become deeply concerned with the people around her. The American title of the book is &quot;Dark Places of the Heart&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Stead died in hospital at Balmain, Sydney, in 1983, aged 80. 

Her former home in Pacific Street, Watsons Bay, was the first site chosen for the Woollahra Council Plaque Scheme, which was launched in 2014 with the aim of honouring significant people who had lived in the area covered by Woollahra Council. A plaque was installed on the footpath outside that home. Another Plaque was installed as part of Sydney Writers Walk as part of a series of 60 circular metal plaques embedded in the footpath between Overseas Passenger Terminal on West Circular Quay and the Sydney Opera House forecourt on East Circular Quay.

The Christina Stead Prize for Fiction has been awarded since 1979 as part of the New South Wales Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards.

<doc id="64460" wikidata="Q191218" url="?curid=64460" title="San Andreas Fault">
<text>The San Andreas Fault is a continental right-lateral strike-slip transform fault that extends roughly through the U.S. state of California. It forms part of the tectonic boundary between the Pacific plate and the North American plate. Traditionally, for scientific purposes, the fault has been classified into three main segments (northern, central, and southern), each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk. The average slip rate along the entire fault ranges from per year.

In the north, the fault terminates offshore near Eureka, California, at the Mendocino triple junction, where three tectonic plates meet. The Cascadia subduction zone intersects the San Andreas fault at the Mendocino triple junction. It has been hypothesized that a major earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone could trigger a rupture along the San Andreas Fault.

In the south, the fault terminates near Bombay Beach, California, in the Salton Sea. Here, the plate motion transitions from right-lateral to divergent, characteristic of the East Pacific Rise further south. In this region, the Salton Trough), the plate boundary has been rifting and pulling apart, creating a new mid-ocean ridge that is an extension of the Gulf of California. Sediment deposited by the Colorado River is preventing the trough from being filled in with sea water from the gulf.

The fault was first identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley. In the wake of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Lawson was tasked with deciphering the origin of the earthquake. He began by surveying and mapping offsets (such as fences or roads that had been sliced in half) along surface ruptures. When the location of these offsets were plotted on a map, he noted that they made a near perfect line on top of the fault he previously discovered. He concluded that the fault must have been the origin of the earthquake.

This line ran through San Andreas Lake, a sag pond. The lake was created from an extensional step over in the fault, which created a natural depression where water could settle. A common misconception is that Lawson named the fault after this lake. However, according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908, he actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Lawson also concluded that the fault extended all the way into Southern California. In 1953, geologist Thomas Dibblee concluded that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault.

A National Science Foundation funded project called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) near Parkfield, California, involved drilling through the fault from 2004 to 2007. The aim was to collect core samples and make direct geophysical and geochemical observations to better understand fault behavior at depth.

== Fault zones ==

=== Northern ===


The northern segment of the fault runs from Hollister, through the Santa Cruz Mountains, epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, then up the San Francisco Peninsula, where it was first identified by Professor Lawson in 1895, then offshore at Daly City near Mussel Rock. This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County. It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland, runs just east of Bodega Head through Bodega Bay and back underwater, returning onshore at Fort Ross. (In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant &quot;sister faults&quot; run more-or-less parallel, and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes.) From Fort Ross, the northern segment continues overland, forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows. It goes back offshore at Point Arena. After that, it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino, where it begins to bend to the west, terminating at the Mendocino triple junction.

=== Central ===
The central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to Hollister. While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes, the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called aseismic creep, where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes. It was formed by a transform boundary.

=== Southern ===


The southern segment (also known as the Mojave segment) begins near Bombay Beach, California. Box Canyon, near the Salton Sea, contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault. The fault then runs along the southern base of the San Bernardino Mountains, crosses through Cajon Pass and continues northwest along the northern base of the San Gabriel Mountains. These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range. In Palmdale, a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the Antelope Valley Freeway. The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of Elizabeth Lake. As it passes the towns of Gorman, Tejon Pass and Frazier Park, the fault begins to bend northward, forming the &quot;Big Bend&quot;. This restraining bend is thought to be where the fault locks up in Southern California, with an earthquake-recurrence interval of roughly 140–160 years. Northwest of Frazier Park, the fault runs through the Carrizo Plain, a long, treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible. The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain.

The southern segment, which stretches from Parkfield in Monterey County all the way to the Salton Sea, is capable of an 8.1-magnitude earthquake. At its closest, this fault passes about to the northeast of Los Angeles. Such a large earthquake on this southern segment would kill thousands of people in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and surrounding areas, and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.

== Plate boundaries ==
The Pacific plate, to the west of the fault, is moving in a northwest direction while the North American plate to the east is moving toward the southwest, but relatively southeast under the influence of plate tectonics. The rate of slippage averages about a year across California.

The southwestward motion of the North American plate towards the Pacific is creating compressional forces along the eastern side of the fault. The effect is expressed as the Coast Ranges. The northwest movement of the Pacific plate is also creating significant compressional forces which are especially pronounced where the North American plate has forced the San Andreas to jog westward. This has led to the formation of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California, and to a lesser but still significant extent, the Santa Cruz Mountains (the location of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989).

Studies of the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates have shown that only about 75 percent of the motion can be accounted for in the movements of the San Andreas and its various branch faults. The rest of the motion has been found in an area east of the Sierra Nevada mountains called the Walker Lane or Eastern California Shear Zone. The reason for this is not clear. Several hypotheses have been offered and research is ongoing. One hypothesis – which gained interest following the Landers earthquake in 1992 – suggests the plate boundary may be shifting eastward away from the San Andreas towards Walker Lane.

Assuming the plate boundary does not change as hypothesized, projected motion indicates that the landmass west of the San Andreas Fault, including Los Angeles, will eventually slide past San Francisco, then continue northwestward toward the Aleutian Trench, over a period of perhaps twenty million years.

== Formation ==

The San Andreas began to form in the mid-Cenozoic about 30 Mya (million years ago). At this time, a spreading center between the Pacific plate and the Farallon plate (which is now mostly subducted, with remnants including the Juan de Fuca plate, Rivera plate, Cocos plate, and the Nazca plate) was beginning to reach the subduction zone off the western coast of North America. As the relative motion between the Pacific and North American plates was different from the relative motion between the Farallon and North American plates, the spreading ridge began to be &quot;subducted&quot;, creating a new relative motion and a new style of deformation along the plate boundaries. These geological features are what are chiefly seen along San Andreas Fault. It also includes a possible driver for the deformation of the Basin and Range, separation of the Baja California peninsula, and rotation of the Transverse Range.

The main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years. The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well-Fenner-San Francisquito fault zone around 22–13 Ma. This system added the San Gabriel Fault as a primary focus of movement between 10–5 Ma. Currently, it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the eastern California shear zone. This complicated evolution, especially along the southern segment, is mostly caused by either the &quot;Big Bend&quot; and/or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and its surrounding branches.

== Study ==

=== Early years===
The fault was first identified in Northern California by UC Berkeley geology professor Andrew Lawson in 1895 and named by him after the surrounding San Andreas valley. Eleven years later, Lawson discovered that the San Andreas Fault stretched southward into southern California after reviewing the effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Large-scale (hundreds of miles) lateral movement along the fault was first proposed in a 1953 paper by geologists Mason Hill and Thomas Dibblee. This idea, which was considered radical at the time, has since been vindicated by modern plate tectonics.

=== Current research ===
Seismologists discovered that the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield in central California consistently produces a magnitude 6.0 earthquake approximately once every 22 years. Following recorded seismic events in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966, scientists predicted that another earthquake should occur in Parkfield in 1993. It eventually occurred in 2004. Due to the frequency of predictable activity, Parkfield has become one of the most important areas in the world for large earthquake research.

In 2004, work began just north of Parkfield on the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD). The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly into the Earth&#x27;s crust and into the San Andreas Fault. An array of sensors will be installed to record earthquakes that happen near this area.

A 2023 study found a link between the water level in Lake Cahuilla (now the Salton Sea) and seismic activity along the southern San Andreas Fault. The study suggests that major earthquakes along this section of the fault coincided with high water levels in the lake. The hydrological load caused by high water levels can more than double the stress on the southern San Andreas Fault, which is likely sufficient for triggering earthquakes. This may explain the abnormally long period of time since the last major earthquake in the region since the lake has dried up.

The San Andreas Fault System has been the subject of a flood of studies. In particular, scientific research performed during the last 23 years has given rise to about 3,400 publications.

=== The next &quot;Big One&quot; ===

A study published in 2006 in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; by Yuri Fialko, an associate professor at the Cecil H. and Ida M. Green Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, found that the San Andreas fault has reached a sufficient stress level for an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale to occur.
This study also found that the risk of a large earthquake may be increasing more rapidly than scientists had previously believed. Moreover, the risk is currently concentrated on the southern section of the fault, i.e. the region around Los Angeles, because strong earthquakes have occurred relatively recently on the central (1857) and northern (1906) segments of the fault, while the southern section has not seen any similar rupture for at least 300 years. According to this study, a major earthquake on that southern section of the San Andreas fault would result in major damage to the Palm Springs–Indio metropolitan area and other cities in San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties in California, and Mexicali Municipality in Baja California. It would be strongly felt (and potentially cause significant damage) throughout much of Southern California, including densely populated areas of Los Angeles County, Ventura County, Orange County, San Diego County, Ensenada Municipality and Tijuana Municipality, Baja California, San Luis Rio Colorado in Sonora and Yuma, Arizona. Older buildings would be especially prone to damage or collapse, as would buildings built on unconsolidated gravel or in coastal areas where water tables are high (and thus subject to soil liquefaction). Of the study, Fialko stated:

Nevertheless, in the years since that publication there has not been a substantial quake in the Los Angeles area, and two major reports issued by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have made variable predictions as to the risk of future seismic events. The ability to predict major earthquakes with sufficient precision to warrant increased precautions has remained elusive.

The U.S. Geological Survey&#x27;s most recent forecast, known as UCERF3 (Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3), released in November 2013, estimated that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 M or greater (i.e. equal to or greater than the 1994 Northridge earthquake) occurs about once every 6.7 years statewide. The same report also estimated there is a 7% probability that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or greater will occur in the next 30 years somewhere along the San Andreas Fault. A different USGS study in 2008 tried to assess the physical, social and economic consequences of a major earthquake in southern California. That study predicted that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas Fault could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213 billion in damage.

==== The HayWired Scenario ====
This scenario hypothesizes the potential effects of a 7.0 magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas Fault in the San Francisco Bay Area. It aims to estimate the impacts on urban infrastructures along with the rebuilding efforts to both the landscape and economy. This study combines not only the geological impacts/effects of the event, but also the societal impacts such as property damage, economic rebuilding, and aims at estimating damages if cities increased risk-reduction. It was developed for preparedness geared towards Bay Area residents and as a warning with an attempt to encourage local policy makers to create infrastructure and protections that would further risk reduction and resilience-building. This study is a combined effort from experts in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering both in the public and private sectors- ranging from urban planners to economists/business professionals. Not only does this study aim to estimate the impacts of the event, but aims to estimate the years of rebuilding and funding needed to recover communities from a potential disaster such as the HayWired Scenario.

The first volume of the HayWired Scenario study was released in 2017, with consistent continuations and contributions by engineers. This continuation was published in the second volume, Engineering Implications, in 2018.

===== Estimating damages =====
As of the 2021 Fact sheet update, there are several estimates on damages ranging from the approximate people affected at home, work, effects of lifeline infrastructures such as telecommunications, and more. This group of scientists have worked together to create estimates of how hazards such as liquefaction, landslides, and fire ignition will impact access to utilities, transportation, and general emergency services.

This study goes into detail about the specific populations to be hardest impacted by a potential earthquake of a 7.0 magnitude, specifically in the San Francisco Bay Area. This includes intensified hardships for those with low-income, racially and culturally-diverse populations, and people with literacy hardships that would significantly &quot;increase their risk of displacement and add to recovery challenges&quot; (Wein et al.).

===== Scientific and economic involvement =====
In addition to societal and landscape impacts, this study looks at potential business interruptions. This portion estimates impacts to the California economy within the first 6 months post-recovery from the event through estimates of &quot;utility outages, property damages, and supply chain disruptions resulting in an estimated $44 billion of gross state product (GSP) losses, or translated at 4% of the California economy&quot;(Wein et al.). This study also projects the recovery of jobs lost in highly impacted areas, such as Alameda County, could take up to 10 years to fully recover job losses and possible economic recession. Trajectories for economic recovery are improved by reconstruction but also delayed with impacts to the construction industry.

=== Cascadia connection ===
A 2008 paper, studying past earthquakes along the Pacific coastal zone, found a correlation in time between seismic events on the northern San Andreas Fault and the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone (which stretches from Vancouver Island to Northern California). Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years. The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time-correlated events. However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone.

== Earthquakes ==

The San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times:

* 1812 San Juan Capistrano earthquake: At least 25 kilometers(16 mi) were ruptured in Southern California. Several of the Roman Catholic missions in the area experienced heavy damage.Early studies indicated the earthquake was on the Newport-Inglewood fault due to the proximity of the damage, but a later study in 2002 indicated the San Andreas fault was the cause. More recent studies suggest a joint rupture which included both the San Andreas Fault, and San Jacinto Fault are more accepted scenarios. Around 40 people died, and the magnitude ranged from 6.9-7.5.
* 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake: About were ruptured in central and southern California. Though it is known as the Fort Tejon earthquake, the epicenter is thought to have been located far to the north, just south of Parkfield. Two deaths were reported. Its moment magnitude was 7.9.
* 1906 San Francisco earthquake: About were ruptured in Northern California. The epicenter was near San Francisco. At least 3,000 people died in the earthquake and subsequent fires. The magnitude was estimated to be 7.8.
* 1957 San Francisco earthquake: A magnitude 5.7 quake with an epicenter on the San Andreas fault in the ocean west of San Francisco and Daly City.
* 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake: About were ruptured (although the rupture did not reach the surface) near Santa Cruz, California, causing 63 deaths and moderate damage in certain vulnerable locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Moment magnitude was about 6.9. This quake occurred on October 17, 1989, at approximately 5:04 pm PDT.
* 2004 Parkfield earthquake: On September 28, 2004, at 10:15 a.m. PDT, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck the Parkfield area. It was felt across the state, including the San Francisco Bay Area.

<doc id="64464" wikidata="Q210798" url="?curid=64464" title="Joris-Karl Huysmans">
<text>Charles-Marie-Georges Huysmans (, ; 5 February 1848 – 12 May 1907) was a French novelist and art critic who published his works as Joris-Karl Huysmans (, variably abbreviated as J. K. or J.-K.). He is most famous for the novel (1884, published in English as &quot;Against the Grain&quot; and as &quot;Against Nature&quot;). He supported himself by way of a 30-year career in the French civil service.

Huysmans&#x27;s work is considered remarkable for its idiosyncratic use of the French language, large vocabulary, descriptions, satirical wit and far-ranging erudition. First considered part of Naturalism, he became associated with the Decadent movement with his publication of &quot;À rebours&quot;. His work expressed his deep pessimism, which had led him to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. In later years, his novels reflected his study of Catholicism, religious conversion, and becoming an oblate. He discussed the iconography of Christian architecture at length in &quot;La cathédrale&quot; (1898), set at Chartres and with its cathedral as the focus of the book.

Huysmans&#x27; novel &quot;Là-bas&quot; (1891) concerns the novelist Durtal, who researches Satanism and the 15th-century child-murderer Gilles de Rais. It was followed by the Durtal trilogy, comprising &quot;En route&quot; (1895), &quot;La cathédrale&quot; (1898), and &quot;L&#x27;Oblat&quot; (1903), in which Durtal takes a spiritual journey and eventually converts to Catholicism; in &quot;L&#x27;Oblat&quot;, he becomes an oblate in a monastery, as Huysmans himself was in the Benedictine Abbey at Ligugé, near Poitiers, in 1901. &quot;La cathédrale&quot; was his most commercially successful work. Its profits enabled Huysmans to retire from his civil service job and live on his royalties.
==Biography==

===Early life===
Huysmans was born in Paris, France, in 1848. &quot;His young mother, Élisabeth-Malvina Badin Huysmans, had been a schoolteacher before she married, and his father, Victor-Godfried-Jan Huysmans [Dutch: Huijsmans], was a Dutch immigrant who worked in Paris as a commercial artist.&quot; Huysmans&#x27;s father (1815-1856) died when Huysmans was eight years old. Constant Cornelis Huijsmans, the Dutch painter and art teacher (including of Vincent van Gogh), was his uncle. Huysmans mother quickly remarried, and Huysmans resented his stepfather, Jules Og, a Protestant who, with Huysmans&#x27;s mother, purchased a bookbindery on the ground floor of the building where they lived. 

During his childhood, Huysmans turned away from the Roman Catholic Church. He was unhappy at school but completed his coursework and earned a .
===Civil service career===
For 32 years, Huysmans worked as a civil servant for the French Ministry of the Interior, a job he found tedious. The young Huysmans was called up to fight in the Franco-Prussian War, but was invalided out with dysentery. He used this experience in an early story, &quot;Sac au dos&quot; (Backpack) (later included in his collection, &quot;Les Soirées de Médan&quot;).

After his retirement from the Ministry in 1898, made possible by the commercial success of his novel, &quot;La cathédrale&quot;, Huysmans planned to leave Paris and move to Ligugé. He intended to set up a community of Catholic artists, including Charles-Marie Dulac (1862-1898). He had praised the young painter in &quot;La cathédrale&quot;. Dulac died a few months before Huysmans completed his arrangements for the move to Ligugé, and he decided to stay in Paris.

In 1905 Huysmans was diagnosed with cancer of the mouth. He died in 1907 and was interred in the cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris.

===Writing career===
He used the name Joris-Karl Huysmans when he published his writing, as a way of honoring his father&#x27;s ancestry. His first major publication was a collection of prose poems, &quot;Le drageoir aux épices&quot; (1874), which were strongly influenced by Baudelaire. They attracted little attention but revealed flashes of the author&#x27;s distinctive style.

Huysmans followed it with the novel, &quot;Marthe, Histoire d&#x27;une fille&quot; (1876). The story of a young prostitute, it was closer to Naturalism and brought him to the attention of Émile Zola. His next works were similar: sombre, realistic and filled with detailed evocations of Paris, a city Huysmans knew intimately. &quot;Les Sœurs Vatard&quot; (1879), dedicated to Zola, deals with the lives of women in a bookbindery. &quot;En ménage&quot; (1881) is an account of a writer&#x27;s failed marriage. The climax of his early work is the novella &quot;À vau-l&#x27;eau&quot; (1882) (translated as &quot;With the Flow&quot;, &quot;Downstream&quot;, and &quot;Drifting&quot;), the story of a downtrodden clerk, Monsieur Folantin, and his quest for a decent meal.

Huysmans&#x27;s 1884 novel (&quot;Against the Grain&quot; or &quot;Against Nature&quot; or &quot;Wrong Way&quot;) became his most famous, or notorious. It featured the character of an aesthete, des Esseintes, and decisively broke from Naturalism. It was seen as an example of &quot;decadent&quot; literature. The description of des Esseintes&#x27;s &quot;alluring liaison&quot; with a &quot;cherry-lipped youth&quot; was believed to have influenced other writers of the decadent movement, including Oscar Wilde.

Huysmans began to drift away from the Naturalists and found new friends among the Symbolist and Catholic writers whose work he had praised in &quot;À rebours.&quot; They included Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly, Villiers de L&#x27;Isle Adam, and Léon Bloy. Stéphane Mallarmé was so pleased with the publicity his verse had received from the novel that he dedicated one of his most famous poems, &quot;Prose pour des Esseintes&quot;, to its hero. Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly told Huysmans that after writing &quot;À rebours,&quot; he would have to choose between &quot;the muzzle of a pistol and the foot of the Cross.&quot; Huysmans, who had received a secular education and abandoned his Catholic religion in childhood, returned to the Catholic Church eight years later.

Huysmans&#x27;s next book after &quot;Á rebours&quot; was the novella &quot;Un dilemme&quot;, which tells &quot;the story of a poor working-class woman who gives birth out of wedlock. When her bourgeois lover, the father of the baby, dies, his heartless family members refuse to help, leaving the mother and her child destitute.&quot; Huysmans next novel, &quot;En rade&quot;, an unromantic account of a summer spent in the country, did not sell as well as its predecessor. &quot;The novel&#x27;s originality lies in its abrupt juxtaposition of real life and dreams.&quot;

His &quot;Là-bas&quot; (1891) attracted considerable attention for its portrayal of Satanism in France in the late 1880s. He introduced the character Durtal, a thinly disguised self-portrait, who is writing a biography of the notorious 15th-century child-murderer and torturer Gilles de Rais. The later Durtal novels, &quot;En route&quot; (1895), &quot;La cathédrale&quot; (1898) and &quot;L&#x27;oblat&quot; (1903), explore Durtal/Huysmans&#x27;s conversion to Roman Catholicism. &quot;En route&quot; depicts Durtal&#x27;s spiritual struggle during his stay at a Trappist monastery. In &quot;La cathédrale&quot; (1898), the protagonist is at Chartres, intensely studying the cathedral and its symbolism. The commercial success of this book enabled Huysmans to retire from the civil service and live on his royalties. In &quot;L&#x27;Oblat&quot;, Durtal becomes a Benedictine oblate. He finally learns to accept the world&#x27;s suffering.

Huysmans was a founding member of the Académie Goncourt.

Huysmans&#x27;s work was known for his idiosyncratic use of the French language, extensive vocabulary, detailed and sensuous descriptions, and biting, satirical wit. It also displays an encyclopaedic erudition, ranging from the catalogue of decadent Latin authors in &quot;À rebours&quot; to the discussion of the iconography of Christian architecture in &quot;La cathédrale&quot;. Huysmans expresses a disgust with modern life and a deep pessimism. This had led him first to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Later he returned to the Catholic Church, as he described in his Durtal novels.

===Art criticism===
In addition to his novels, Huysmans was known for his art criticism, collected in his books &quot;L&#x27;Art Moderne&quot; (1883) and &quot;Certains&quot; (1889). &quot;[H]e was a perceptive and talented art critic who was among the first to recognize the genius of Degas and the Impressionists.&quot; But after Huysmans sent a copy of &quot;L&#x27;Art Moderne&quot; to Camille Pissarro, Pissarro wrote to him, &quot;How is it that you don&#x27;t say one word about Cézanne, whom not one of us has failed to acknowledge as one of the most singular temperaments of our time, and one who has had a very great influence on modern art? I was extremely surprised by your articles on Monet. How can such astonishing vision, such phenomenal execution and such rare and extensive decorative feeling not have struck you back in 1870 ...?&quot;

==Style and influence==


&quot;It takes me two years to &#x27;document&#x27; myself for a novel – two years of hard work. That is the trouble with the naturalistic novel – it requires so much documentary care. I never make, like Zola, a plan for a book. I know how it will begin and how it will end – that&#x27;s all. When I finally get to writing it, it goes along rather fast – &quot;assez vite.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Barbaric in its profusion, violent in its emphasis, wearying in its splendor, it is — especially in regard to things seen – extraordinarily expressive, with all the shades of a painter&#x27;s palette. Elaborately and deliberately perverse, it is in its very perversity that Huysmans&#x27;s work — so fascinating, so repellent, so instinctively artificial — comes to represent, as the work of no other writer can be said to do, the main tendencies, the chief results, of the Decadent movement in literature.&quot; (Arthur Symons, &quot;The Decadent Movement in Literature&quot;)

&quot;Continually dragging Mother Image by the hair or the feet down the worm-eaten staircase of terrified Syntax.&quot; (Léon Bloy, quoted in Robert Baldick, &quot;The Life of J.-K. Huysmans&quot;). Critical reviews by Léon Bloy of &quot;À rebours&quot;, &quot;En rade&quot;, and &quot;Là-bas&quot; published contemporaneously, in various journals or reviews, as Huysmans&#x27;s novels came out over the years, in 1884, 1887, 1891, can be found, collected and published six years after Huysmans&#x27;s death, in book form, in &quot;On Huysmans&#x27; Tomb.&quot;

&quot;It is difficult to find a writer whose vocabulary is so extensive, so constantly surprising, so sharp and yet so exquisitely gamey in flavour, so constantly lucky in its chance finds and in its very inventiveness.&quot; (Julien Gracq)

&quot;In short, he kicks the oedipal to the curb&quot; (M. Quaine, &quot;Heirs and Graces&quot;, 1932, Jowett / Arcana)

Huysmans&#x27;s novel, &quot;Against the Grain&quot;, has more discussions of sound, smell, and taste than perhaps any other work of literature. For example, one chapter consists entirely of smell hallucinations so vivid that they exhaust the book&#x27;s central character, Des Esseintes, a bizarre, depraved aristocrat. A student of the perfumer&#x27;s art, Esseintes has developed several devices for titillating his jaded senses. Besides special instruments for re-creating any conceivable odour, he has constructed a special &quot;mouth organ&quot; designed to stimulate his palate rather than his ears. The organ&#x27;s regular pipes have been replaced by rows of little barrels, each containing a different liqueur. In Esseintes&#x27;s mind, the taste of each liqueur corresponded to the sound of a particular instrument:

By careful and persistent experimentation, Esseintes learned to &quot;execute on his tongue a succession of voiceless melodies; noiseless funeral marches, solemn and stately; could hear in his mouth solos of crème de menthe, duets of vespertro and rum.&quot;

The protagonist of &quot;Submission&quot; (2015), a novel by Michel Houellebecq, is a literary scholar specializing in Huysmans and his work; Huysmans&#x27;s relation to Catholicism serves as a foil for the book&#x27;s treatment of Islam in France.

==Personal life==
Huysmans never married or had children. He had a long-term, on-and-off relationship with Anna Meunier, a seamstress.

Huysmans was made a &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; in 1892, for his work with the civil service. In 1905, his admirers persuaded the French government to promote him to &quot;Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; for his literary achievements.

<doc id="64474" wikidata="Q126002" url="?curid=64474" title="Concatenation">
<text>In formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end. For example, the concatenation of &quot;snow&quot; and &quot;ball&quot; is &quot;snowball&quot;. In certain formalizations of concatenation theory, also called string theory, string concatenation is a primitive notion.

==Syntax==
In many programming languages, string concatenation is a binary infix operator, and in some it is written without an operator. This is implemented in different ways:

* Overloading the plus sign codice_1 Example from C#: codice_2 has the value codice_3.
* Dedicated operator, such as codice_4 in PHP, codice_5 in Visual Basic and codice_6 in SQL. This has the advantage over reusing codice_1 that it allows implicit type conversion to string.
* string literal concatenation, which means that adjacent strings are concatenated without any operator. Example from C: codice_8 has the value codice_3.
In many scientific publications or standards the concatenation operator notation used is codice_6.

==Implementation==
In programming, string concatenation generally occurs at run time, as string values are typically not known until run time. However, in the case of string literals, the values are known at compile time, and thus string concatenation can be done at compile time, either via string literal concatenation or via constant folding, a potential run-time optimization.

==Concatenation of sets of strings==
In formal language theory and pattern matching (including regular expressions), the concatenation operation on strings is generalised to an operation on sets of strings as follows:

For two sets of strings &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2, the &quot;concatenation&quot; &quot;S&quot;1&quot;S&quot;2 consists of all strings of the form &quot;vw&quot; where &quot;v&quot; is a string from &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;w&quot; is a string from &quot;S&quot;2, or formally . Many authors also use concatenation of a string set and a single string, and vice versa, which are defined similarly by and . In these definitions, the string &quot;vw&quot; is the ordinary concatenation of strings &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; as defined in the introductory section.

For example, if , and , then &quot;FR&quot; denotes the set of all chess board coordinates in algebraic notation, while e&quot;R&quot; denotes the set of all coordinates of the kings&#x27; file.

In this context, sets of strings are often referred to as formal languages. The concatenation operator is usually expressed as simple juxtaposition (as with multiplication).

==Algebraic properties==
The strings over an alphabet, with the concatenation operation, form an associative algebraic structure with identity element the null string—a free monoid.

Sets of strings with concatenation and alternation form a semiring, with concatenation (*) distributing over alternation (+); 0 is the empty set and 1 the set consisting of just the null string.

==Applications==

===Audio and telephony===
In programming for telephony, concatenation is used to provide dynamic audio feedback to a user. For example, in a &quot;time of day&quot; speaking clock, concatenation is used to give the correct time by playing the appropriate recordings concatenated together. For example: &quot;at the tone, the time will be&quot;, &quot;eight&quot;, &quot;thirty&quot;, &quot;five&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;twenty&quot;, &quot;five&quot;, &quot;seconds&quot;.

The recordings themselves exist separately, but playing them one after the other provides a grammatically correct sentence to the listener.

This technique is also used in number change announcements, voice mail systems, or most telephony applications that provide dynamic feedback to the caller (e.g. moviefone, tellme, and others).

Programming for any kind of computerised public address system can also employ concatenation for dynamic public announcements (for example, flights in an airport). The system would archive recorded speech of numbers, routes or airlines, destinations, times, etc. and play them back in a specific sequence to produce a grammatically correct sentence that is announced throughout the facility.

===Database theory===
One of the principles of relational database design is that the fields of data tables should reflect a single characteristic of the table&#x27;s subject, which means that they should not contain concatenated strings. When concatenation is desired in a report, it should be provided at the time of running the report. For example, to display the physical address of a certain customer, the data might include building number, street name, building sub-unit number, city name, state/province name, postal code, and country name, e.g., &quot;123 Fake St Apt 4, Boulder, CO 80302, USA&quot;, which combines seven fields. However, the customers data table should not use one field to store that concatenated string; rather, the concatenation of the seven fields should happen upon running the report. The reason for such principles is that without them, the entry and updating of large volumes of data becomes error-prone and labor-intensive. Separately entering the city, state, ZIP code, and nation allows data-entry validation (such as detecting an invalid state abbreviation). Then those separate items can be used for sorting or indexing the records, such as all with &quot;Boulder&quot; as the city name.

===Recreational mathematics===
In recreational mathematics, many problems concern the properties of numbers under concatenation of their numerals in some base. Examples include home primes (primes obtained by repeatedly factoring the increasing concatenation of prime factors of a given number), Smarandache–Wellin numbers (the concatenations of the first prime numbers), and the Champernowne and Copeland–Erdős constants (the real numbers formed by the decimal representations of the positive integers and the prime numbers, respectively).

<doc id="64477" wikidata="Q714866" url="?curid=64477" title="Ulrich of Augsburg">
<text>Ulrich of Augsburg (890 – 4 July 973), sometimes spelled &quot;Uodalric&quot; or &quot;Odalrici&quot;, was Prince-Bishop of Augsburg in the Holy Roman Empire. He was the first saint to be canonised not by a local authority but by a Pope.

== Life ==
=== Early years ===
Much of the information concerning Ulrich is derived from the &quot;Life of St Ulrich&quot; written by Gerhard of Augsburg sometime between 982 and 993. Ulrich was born in 890 at Kyburg in present-day canton of Zürich in Switzerland. He was the son of Hupald, Count of Dillingen (d. 909) and Dietpirch of Swabia (also known as Theoberga). His maternal grandfather was Adalbert II the Illustrious, Count of Thurgau. His family was connected with the dukes of Alamannia and the Ottonian dynasty. An unnamed sister served as a nun in Buchau.

As was customary, his parents presented him as an oblate to the church while he was still a child. A sickly child, at the age of seven he was sent to the monastery of St. Gall, where he proved to be an excellent scholar. While there, he became friends with Wiborada – a recluse living near the monastery – who then foretold that her young friend was destined to become a bishop. He resolved to enter the priesthood but was in doubt whether to enter the Benedictine Abbey of St. Gall or to become a secular priest. Sometime before April 910, he was sent for further training to a kinsman, Adalbero von Augsburg, Bishop of Augsburg, who made him chamberlain. Upon Adalbero&#x27;s death (28 April 910) Ulrich returned home. The Duke of Swabia presented him at the court of Henry the Fowler, where Ulrich became one of the household retainers.

=== Bishop of Augsburg ===
Through the influence of his maternal uncle, Burchard II, Duke of Swabia, and other relatives, Ulrich was appointed bishop of Augsburg by Henry the Fowler and was consecrated on 28 December 923. He sought to improve the low moral and social condition of the clergy. The See of Augsburg reached the period of its greatest splendor under Ulrich; he raised the standard of training and discipline among the clergy by the reformation of existing schools and the establishment of new ones, and by canonical visitations and synods; he provided for the poor, and rebuilt decayed churches and monasteries. He built churches in honor of St. Afra and St. John and founded the monastery of St. Stephen for Benedictine nuns. For purposes of obtaining relics he went on two journeys to Rome, in 910, and in 952 or 953. German emperor Otto the Great granted Ulrich the right to mint coins.

During the struggle between Otto and his son Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, Ulrich remained loyal to Otto, holding for him the castle of Schwabmünchen, which was within the territorial jurisdiction of the Bishop of Augsburg. When in the summer of 954 father and son were ready to attack each other at Illertissen in Swabia, at the last moment Ulrich and Bishop Hartbert of Chur were able to mediate between Otto and Liudolf. Ulrich succeeded in persuading Liudolf and Conrad, Duke of Lorraine, Otto&#x27;s son-in-law, to ask the king&#x27;s pardon on 17 December 954.

=== Against the Magyars ===
Magyars repeatedly attacked in the territories of Bavaria and Swabia. Ulrich served as general in the defense of Augsburg. He built a stone wall fortification around the city. During these attacks many churches and buildings were destroyed, which Ulrich later rebuilt. Ulrich attended several imperial meetings and synods, such as at Ingelheim in 948, Augsburg in 952, Rome in 972 and again at Ingelheim in 972.

Soon after, the Magyars entered Germany, plundering and burning as they went, and in 955 advanced as far as Augsburg, which they besieged. It was due to Ulrich&#x27;s ability and courage that Augsburg was able to hold out against the besiegers until Emperor Otto arrived. According to his biographer Gerhard, Bishop Ulrich took the lead in the defense of the city. On the first day of the attack, Bishop Ulrich rode out to encourage the towns&#x27; soldiers in their defense of the city&#x27;s gate. While the battle raged, the bishop, dressed in his ecclesiastical robes, inspired his men, with the 23rd Psalm (&quot;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death&quot;). While this defense was going on, the King was raising an army to march south. The fiercest fighting probably took place on 8 August 955 at the eastern gate, which the Hungarians tried to storm in large numbers. The Bishop&#x27;s men defended the gate bravely and killed the leader of the attack, forcing the Hungarians to withdraw. That evening Ulrich returned to the city to direct throughout the night the repair and strengthening of its walls. The next day the Hungarians launched a wider general attack. During the battle, Berchtold of Risinesburg arrived, which heralded the approach of the German army. At the end of the day, the siege was suspended. Ulrich&#x27;s ability to hold out during the siege bought precious time for the emperor.

Ulrich subsequently contributed much to the decisive victory at the Battle of Lechfeld (10 August 955), where the invaders were finally defeated. However, Ulrich Schmid maintains that &quot;The later assertion that Ulrich himself took part in the battle is incorrect&quot;.

== His character ==
Ulrich demanded a high moral standard of himself and others. A hundred years after his death, a letter apparently written by him, which opposed celibacy, and supported the marriage of priests, suddenly appeared. The forger of the letter counted on the opinion of the common people, who would regard celibacy as unjust if Ulrich, known for the rigidity of his morals, upheld the marriage of priests. Ulrich was also steadfastly loyal, as a prince of the empire, to the emperor. He was one of the most important props of the Ottonian policy, which rested mainly upon the ecclesiastical princes. He constantly attended the judicial courts held by the king and in the Imperial Diets.

== Later life ==
Ulrich took part in the Diet held on 20 September 972, when he defended himself against the charge of nepotism in regard to his nephew Adalbero, whom he had appointed his coadjutor on account of his own illness and desire to retire to a Benedictine abbey. Ulrich did, in fact, resign as prince-bishop and retired to Ottobeuren Abbey, where he became abbot.

As morning dawned on 4 July 973, Ulrich had ashes strewn on the ground in the shape of a cross; the cross sprinkled with holy water, and he was placed upon it. His nephew Richwin came with a message and greeting from Emperor Otto II as the sun rose, and immediately upon this, while the clergy sang the Litany, Ulrich died. He was buried at the St. Afra church he had rebuilt in Augsburg; the burial was performed by Bishop Wolfgang of Regensburg. Later the St. Ulrich and Afra church was built in the same spot. He was succeeded by Bishop Henry I.

The maniple of Ulrich was woven in red and white silk using tablet weaving and Ulrich&#x27;s relic was later analyzed by Peter Collingwood in his &quot;The Techniques of Tablet Weaving&quot;; Collingwood regarded it as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

== Veneration ==

When Ulrich was too old and weak to say Mass, angels are said to have come to him to assist him. Places that were named after him are said to be host to healing abilities. Attesting to his early cultus, there is a miniature from the tenth century in a manuscript now in the library of Einsiedeln. Other miniatures are at the Bavarian State Library, in manuscripts dating from the year 1454.

Many miracles are said to have been wrought at his grave; only 20 years after his death, Ulrich was canonised by Pope John XV on 4 July 993. He was the first saint to be canonised by a Pope, rather than by a local authority. Walter of Pontoise was the last saint in Western Europe to have been canonised by an authority other than the Pope; he was canonised by Hugh of Amiens, the Archbishop of Rouen in 1153.

=== Patronage ===
Along with Afra and Simpert, Ulrich is a patron saint of Augsburg. Legend held that pregnant women who drank from his chalice had easy deliveries, and thus developed his patronage of pregnant women and easy births. The touch of his pastoral cross was used to heal people bitten by rabid dogs.

The veneration of Ulrich was carried to the Western Hemisphere by the German Catholic peasant pioneers whom Francis Xavier Pierz persuade to settle in central Minnesota following the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851. Along with Magnus of Füssen, Ulrich&#x27;s intercession was credited with the defeat of the 1856–1857 Rocky Mountain locust plague, and both saints continued afterwards to be venerated in and around Stearns County, Minnesota, with pilgrimages and religious processions. (See also Assumption Chapel).

<text>The hilt (rarely called a haft or shaft) is the handle of a knife, dagger, sword, or bayonet, consisting of a guard, grip, and pommel. The guard may contain a crossguard or quillons. A tassel or sword knot may be attached to the guard or pommel.

== Pommel ==

The pommel (Anglo-Norman &quot;little apple&quot;) is an enlarged fitting at the top of the handle. They were originally developed to prevent the sword from slipping from the hand. From around the 11th century in Europe, they became heavy enough to be a counterweight to the blade. This gave the sword a point of balance not too far from the hilt, allowing a more fluid fighting style. Depending on sword design and swordsmanship style, the pommel may also be used to strike the opponent (e.g. using the Mordhau technique).

Pommels have appeared in a wide variety of shapes, including oblate spheroids, crescents, disks, wheels, and animal or bird heads. They are often engraved or inlayed with various designs and occasionally gilt and mounted with jewels.

Ewart Oakeshott introduced a system of classification of medieval pommel forms in his &quot;The Sword in the Age of Chivalry&quot; (1964) to stand alongside his blade typology. Oakeshott pommel types are enumerated with capital letters A–Z, with subtypes indicated by numerals.

== Grip ==

The grip is the handle of the sword. It is usually made of wood or metal and often covered with shagreen (untanned tough leather or shark skin). Shark skin proved to be the most durable in temperate climates but deteriorates in hot climates. Consequently, rubber became popular in the latter half of the 19th century. Many sword types alternatively opt for ray skin, referred to in katana construction as . Whatever material covers the grip, it is usually both glued on and wrapped with wire in a helix.

== Guard ==
The guard is just above the grip. It is a common misconception that the &quot;cross-guard&quot; protects the wielder&#x27;s entire hand from the opposing sword; only with the abandonment of the shield and then the armoured gauntlet did a full hand guard become necessary. The crossguard still protected the user from a blade that was deliberately slid down the length of the blade to cut off or injure the hand.

Early swords do not have true guards but simply a form of &quot;stop&quot; to prevent the hand slipping up the blade when thrusting, as they were invariably used in conjunction with a shield.

From the 11th century, European sword guards took the form of a straight crossbar (later called &quot;quillon&quot;) perpendicular to the blade.

Beginning in the 16th century in Europe, guards became more and more elaborate, with additional loops and curved bars or branches to protect the hand. A single curved piece alongside the fingers (roughly parallel with the handle/blade and perpendicular to any crossguards) was referred to as a knuckle-bow.

Ultimately, the bars could be supplemented or replaced with metal plates that could be ornamentally pierced. The term &quot;basket hilt&quot; eventually came into vogue to describe such designs, and there are a variety of basket-hilted swords.

Simultaneously, emphasis upon the thrust attack with rapiers and smallswords revealed a vulnerability to thrusting. By the 17th century, guards were developed that incorporated a solid shield that surrounded the blade out to a diameter of up to two inches or more. Older forms of this guard retained the quillons or a single quillon, but later forms eliminated the quillons, altogether being referred to as a cup-hilt. This latter form is the basis of the guards of modern foils and épées.

== Ricasso ==

The ricasso is a blunt section of blade just above the guard. On developed hilts it is protected by an extension of the guard. On two-handed swords, the ricasso provided a third hand position, permitting the user&#x27;s hands to be further apart for better leverage.

== Sword knot ==

The sword knot or sword strap, sometimes called a tassel, is a lanyard—usually of leather but sometimes of woven gold or silver bullion, or more often metallic lace—looped around the hand to prevent the sword being lost if it is dropped. Although they have a practical function, sword knots often had a decorative design. For example, the British Army generally adopted a white leather strap with a large acorn knot made out of gold wire for infantry officers at the end of the 19th century. Such acorn forms of tassels were called &#x27;boxed&#x27;, which was the way of securing the fringe of the tassel along its bottom line such that the strands could not separate and become entangled or lost. Many sword knots were also made of silk with a fine, ornamental alloy gold or silver metal wire woven into it in a specified pattern.

The art and history of tassels are known by its French name, , or as it was called in German. The military output of the artisans called (ornamental braid, lace, cord, or trimmings makers) is evident in catalogs of various military uniform and regalia makers of centuries past. The broader art form of , with its divisions of Decor, Clergy and Nobility, Upholstery, Coaches and Livery, and Military, is covered in a few books on that subject, none of which are in English.

Indian swords had the tassel attached through an eyelet at the end of the pommel.

Chinese swords, both &quot;jian&quot; and &quot;dao&quot;, often have lanyards or tassels attached. As with Western sword knots, these serve both decorative and practical functions, and the manipulation of the tassel is a part of some &quot;jian&quot; performances.
