<text>Muskeg (; ; , lit. &quot;moss bog&quot;) is a peat-forming ecosystem found in several northern climates, most commonly in Arctic and boreal areas. Muskeg is approximately synonymous with bog or peatland, and is a standard term in Canada and Alaska. The term became common in these areas because it is of Cree origin, () meaning &quot;low-lying marsh&quot;.

Muskeg consists of non-living organic material in various states of decomposition (as peat), ranging from fairly intact sphagnum moss, to sedge peat, to highly decomposed humus. Pieces of wood can make up five to fifteen percent of the peat soil. The water table tends to be near the surface. The sphagnum moss forming it can hold fifteen to thirty times its own weight in water, which allows the spongy wet muskeg to also form on sloping ground.

Muskeg patches are ideal habitats for beavers, pitcher plants, agaric mushrooms and a variety of other organisms.

==Composition==
Muskeg forms because permafrost, clay or bedrock prevents water drainage. The water from rain and snow collects, forming permanently waterlogged vegetation and stagnant pools. Muskeg is wet, acidic, and relatively infertile, which prevents large trees from growing, although stunted shore pine, cottonwood, some species of willow, and black spruce are typically found in these habitats. It needs two conditions to develop: abundant rain and cool summers. A dead plant that falls on dry soil is normally attacked by bacteria and fungi and quickly rots. If the same plant lands in water or on saturated soil, it decomposes differently. Less oxygen is available under water, so aerobic bacteria and fungi fail to colonize the submerged debris effectively. In addition, cool temperatures retard bacterial and fungal growth. This causes slow decomposition, and thus the plant debris gradually accumulates to form peat and eventually muskeg. Depending on the underlying topography of the land, muskeg can reach depths greater than 30 metres (100 ft).

==Description==
Although, at first glance, muskeg resembles a plain covered with short grasses, a closer look reveals a bizarre and almost unearthly landscape. Small stands of stunted (often-dead) trees, which vaguely resemble natural bonsai, grow where land protrudes above the water table, with small pools of water (stained dark red) scattered about. Its grassland appearance invites the unwary to tread on it; however, even the most solid muskeg is spongy and waterlogged. Traveling through muskeg is a strange and dangerous experience, for the unaccustomed. Muskeg can grow atop bodies of water, especially small ponds and streams. Because of the water beneath, the muskeg surface sometimes moves and ripples underfoot. Thinner patches can collapse under significant weight, and cause larger animals to fall-through and become trapped underneath, drowning if an escape route is not found. Moose are at a particular disadvantage, with their preferred diet of aquatic plants and grasses possibly drawing them dangerously near to muskeg; due to their long legs, minimal hoof area, and great weight, they are at great risk of falling and drowning. Hunters and hikers may occasionally encounter young moose in muskeg-covered ponds submerged up to their torsos or necks, having been unaware of the unstable ground.

==Surface strength==

Muskeg can be a significant impediment to transportation. Legend holds that during the 1870s, muskeg in Northern Ontario swallowed a train and a thousand feet of track whole when a track was accidentally laid on muskeg.

Many other instances have been reported of heavy construction equipment vanishing into muskeg in the spring as the frozen muskeg beneath the vehicle thawed. Construction in muskeg-laden areas sometimes requires the complete removal of the soil and filling with gravel. If the muskeg is not completely cleared to bedrock, its high water content will cause buckling and distortion from winter freezing, much like permafrost.

One method of working atop muskeg is to place large logs on the ground, covered with a thick layer of clay or other stable material. This is commonly called a corduroy road. To increase the effectiveness of the corduroy, prevent erosion, and allow removal of material with less disturbance to the muskeg, a geotextile fabric is sometimes placed down before the logs. However temporary winter access roads on muskeg (ice road), created by clearing the insulating snow and allowing the muskeg to freeze, are more commonly used as they are cheaper to construct and easier to decommission. Water is often sprayed on these roads to thicken the ice allowing heavy trucks and equipment to safely access remote sites in the winter.
== In fiction ==
In Jack London&#x27;s short story, &quot;Love of Life,&quot; the starving protagonist eats muskeg berries along the trail. &quot;A muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water. In the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter. The man knew there was no nourishment in the berries, but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience.&quot;

In Martha Ostenso&#x27;s novel &quot;Wild Geese&quot;, the land owned and beloved by the antagonist plays an important role:
&quot;Southeast, under the ridge, bottomless and foul, lay the muskeg, the sore to Caleb&#x27;s eye. In the heat of summer it gave up sickly vapours in which clouds of mosquitoes rose. Cattle and horses, breaking through the pasture fence and heading for the hay field, had disappeared beneath its spongy surface.&quot; (p. 12)

In Rick Riordan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Son of Neptune&quot; (in the Heroes of Olympus series), Percy Jackson steps off a path near Seward, Alaska, and falls through the muskeg. He would have drowned if another character, Hazel Levesque, had not jumped in after him. Frank Zhang, the third of their trio, pulled them out using his bow, with Hazel holding onto it and Percy holding onto her ankles.

<text>Asia Carrera Lemmon (born Jessica Steinhauser, August 6, 1973) is an American former pornographic actress.

==Early life==
Asia Carrera was born Jessica Steinhauser in New York City to a German mother and Japanese father, the oldest of four siblings. She was raised in Little Silver, New Jersey, and attended Red Bank Regional High School. At the age of 16, she taught English at Tsuruga College in Tsuruga, Fukui, Japan. 

At 17 years old, Carrera ran away from home due to overwhelming parental pressures and attempted suicide several times. She received a full scholarship to Rutgers University, but dropped out after realizing she could make large sums of money dancing and modeling. Soon after leaving Rutgers, she moved to Los Angeles.

Carrera is a member of Mensa, with an IQ of 156.

==Career==
===Adult film career===
Carrera&#x27;s adult film career started in 1993 and appeared in over 350 adult films. In 1995, she became the first Asian performer ever to win the AVN Female Performer of the Year Award. Carrera retired from the film industry in 2003, following her marriage to Don Lemmon.

Carrera lent her voice to several erotic hentai OVAs for publisher Pink Pineapple, such as &quot;Inmu&quot; (2001) and &quot;Shusaku&quot; (1999). In October 2001, Carrera attended the Big Apple Anime Fest in New York City for her voice roles and along with Kobe Tai was an Opening Night Guest of Honor at the fest&#x27;s Midnight Anime Concourse.

Carrera was also in the 2012 documentary &quot;After Porn Ends&quot;, which documents the lives of actors after they leave the adult film industry. In the documentary, she discusses her membership in Mensa. Despite being a celebrity member of the group, the organization refused to link to her website because it contained pornographic elements.

===Other work===
In 1998, she appeared in an uncredited cameo role in the film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; in the faux pornographic movie &quot;Logjammin&quot;&#x27; within the film.

Carrera was a guest reviewer for &quot;Maximum PC&quot; magazine.

==Personal life==

Carrera is an atheist. In November 2014, she wore a colander on her head for her Utah driver&#x27;s license photograph. State law normally prohibits the wearing of hats in driver license photos, but there is an exception for religious headwear and Carerra&#x27;s colander was worn in honor of the religion of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. She is one of about a dozen &quot;Pastafarian&quot; Utahns who have worn a colander in their official state ID photos.

In September 1995, Carrera married adult film director Bud Lee. They divorced in 2003, but remain good friends. She married nutritionist and author Don Lemmon on December 19, 2003. The couple moved to St. George, Utah, where she gave birth to a daughter on March 4, 2005. On June 10, 2006, Lemmon was killed in a car accident outside of Las Vegas. Seven weeks later, on July 31, Carrera gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second child. In June 2012, she gave birth to a boy whom she later placed for adoption.

In 2015, she was arrested for DUI with &quot;a reported blood alcohol content of .254 percent – more than three times Utah’s .08 legal limit.&quot; She pleaded no contest in exchange for avoiding jail time and was sentenced to house arrest.

In 2015, Carrera began studies at Utah Tech University, where she was joined two years later by her 11-year-old daughter. At that time, Carrera&#x27;s daughter was the youngest student to attend college at Utah Tech, and the youngest full-time college student in the state of Utah.

Carrera has a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Utah Tech, a Master&#x27;s in Education from Texas A&amp;M University, and a Juris Doctor from St. Mary&#x27;s University School of Law.

==Awards and nominations==

<doc id="65041" wikidata="Q746699" url="?curid=65041" title="Singleton pattern">
<text>In object-oriented programming, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance. It is one of the well-known &quot;Gang of Four&quot; design patterns, which describe how to solve recurring problems in object-oriented software. The pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

More specifically, the singleton pattern allows classes to:
* Ensure they only have one instance
* Provide easy access to that instance
* Control their instantiation (for example, hiding the constructors of a class)

The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

== Common uses ==
Singletons are often preferred to global variables because they do not pollute the global namespace (or their containing namespace). Additionally, they permit lazy allocation and initialization, whereas global variables in many languages will always consume resources.

The singleton pattern can also be used as a basis for other design patterns, such as the abstract factory, factory method, builder and prototype patterns. Facade objects are also often singletons because only one facade object is required.

Logging is a common real-world use case for singletons, because all objects that wish to log messages require a uniform point of access and conceptually write to a single source.

== Implementations ==
Implementations of the singleton pattern ensure that only one instance of the singleton class ever exists and typically provide global access to that instance.

Typically, this is accomplished by:
* Declaring all constructors of the class to be private, which prevents it from being instantiated by other objects
* Providing a static method that returns a reference to the instance
The instance is usually stored as a private static variable; the instance is created when the variable is initialized, at some point before when the static method is first called.

This C++23 implementation is based on the pre-C++98 implementation in the book .
import std;

class Singleton {
public:
 // defines an class operation that lets clients access its unique instance.
 static Singleton&amp; get() {
 // may be responsible for creating its own unique instance.
 if (nullptr == instance) instance = new Singleton;
 return *instance;
 Singleton(const Singleton&amp;) = delete; // rule of three
 Singleton&amp; operator=(const Singleton&amp;) = delete;
 static void destruct() {
 delete instance;
 instance = nullptr;
 // existing interface goes here
 int getValue() {
 return value;
 void setValue(int value_) {
 value = value_;
private:
 Singleton() = default; // no public constructor
 ~Singleton() = default; // no public destructor
 static Singleton* instance; // declaration class variable
 int value;

Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr; // definition class variable

int main() {
 Singleton::get().setValue(42);
 std::println(&quot;value={}&quot;, Singleton::get().getValue());
 Singleton::destruct();


The program output is
value=42
This is an implementation of the Meyers singleton in C++11. The Meyers singleton has no destruct method. The program output is the same as above.
import std;

class Singleton {
public:
 static Singleton&amp; get() {
 static Singleton instance;
 return instance;
 int getValue() {
 return value;
 void setValue(int value_) {
 value = value_;
private:
 Singleton() = default;
 ~Singleton() = default;
 int value;

int main() {
 Singleton::get().setValue(42);
 std::println(&quot;value={}&quot;, Singleton::get().getValue());


=== Lazy initialization ===

A singleton implementation may use lazy initialization in which the instance is created when the static method is first invoked. In multithreaded programs, this can cause race conditions that result in the creation of multiple instances. The following Java 5+ example is a thread-safe implementation, using lazy initialization with double-checked locking.
public class Singleton {

 private static volatile Singleton instance = null;

 private Singleton() {}

 public static Singleton getInstance() {
 if (instance == null) {
 synchronized(Singleton.class) {
 if (instance == null) {
 instance = new Singleton();
 }
 return instance;
}
== Criticism ==
Some consider the singleton to be an anti-pattern that introduces global state into an application, often unnecessarily. This introduces a potential dependency on the singleton by other objects, requiring analysis of implementation details to determine whether a dependency actually exists. This increased coupling can introduce difficulties with unit testing. In turn, this places restrictions on any abstraction that uses the singleton, such as preventing concurrent use of multiple instances.

Singletons also violate the single-responsibility principle because they are responsible for enforcing their own uniqueness along with performing their normal functions.

<text>The Portable Executable (PE) format is a file format for executables, object code, dynamic-link-libraries (DLLs), and binary files used on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems, as well as in UEFI environments. It is the standard format for executables on Windows NT-based systems, including files such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 (for system drivers), and codice_4. At its core, the PE format is a structured data container that gives the Windows operating system loader everything it needs to properly manage the executable code it contains. This includes references for dynamically linked libraries, tables for importing and exporting APIs, resource management data and thread-local storage (TLS) information.

According to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specification, the PE format is also the accepted standard for executables in EFI environments. On Windows NT systems, it currently supports a range of instruction sets, including IA-32, x86-64 (AMD64/Intel 64), IA-64, ARM and ARM64. Before the advent of Windows 2000, Windows NT (and by extension the PE format) also supported MIPS, Alpha, and PowerPC architectures. Moreover, thanks to its use in Windows CE, PE has maintained compatibility with several MIPS, ARM (including Thumb), and SuperH variants.

Functionally, the PE format is similar to other platform-specific executable formats, such as the ELF format used in Linux and most Unix-like systems, and the Mach-O format found in macOS and iOS.

== History ==

Microsoft first introduced the PE format with Windows NT 3.1, replacing the older 16-bit New Executable (NE) format. Soon after, Windows 95, 98, ME, and the Win32s extension for Windows 3.1x, all adopted the PE structure. Each PE file includes a DOS executable header, which generally displays the message &quot;This program cannot be run in DOS mode&quot;. However, this DOS section can be replaced by a fully functional DOS program, as demonstrated in the Windows 98 SE installer. Developers can add such a program using the codice_5 switch with Microsoft&#x27;s linker, effectively creating a fat binary.

Over time, the PE format has grown with the Windows platform. Notable extensions include the .NET PE format for managed code, PE32+ for 64-bit address space support, and a specialized version for Windows CE.

To determine whether a PE file is intended for 32-bit or 64-bit architectures, one can examine the Machine field in the IMAGE_FILE_HEADER. Common machine values are codice_6 for 32-bit Intel processors and codice_7 for x64 processors. Additionally, the Magic field in the codice_8 reveals whether addresses are 32-bit or 64-bit. A value of codice_9 indicates a 32-bit (PE32) file, while codice_10 indicates a 64-bit (PE32+) file.

==Technical details==

===Layout===

A PE file consists of several headers and sections that instruct the dynamic linker about on how to map the file into memory. An executable image consists of several different regions, each requiring different memory protection attributes. To ensure proper alignment, the start of each section must align to a page boundary. For instance, the &quot;.text&quot; section, which contains program code, is typically mapped as an execute/read-only. Conversely, the &quot;.data&quot; section, which holds global variables, is mapped as no-execute/read write. However, to conserve space, sections are not aligned on disk in this manner. The dynamic linker maps each section to memory individually and assigns the correct permissions based on the information in the headers.

===Import table===
The &quot;import address table&quot; (IAT) is used as a lookup table when the application calls a function in a different module. The imports can be specified by ordinal or by name. Because a compiled program cannot know the memory locations of its dependent libraries beforehand, an indirect jump is necessary for API calls. As the dynamic linker holds modules and resolves dependancies, it populates the IAT slots with actual addresses of the corresponding library functions. Although this adds an extra jump, incurring a performance penalty compared to intermodular calls, it minimizes the number of memory pages that that require copy-on-write changes, thus conserving memory and disk I/O. If a call is known to be intermodular beforehand (if indicated by a dllimport attribute), the compiler can generate optimized code with a simple indirect call opcode.

=== Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) ===
PE files aren&#x27;t position-independent by default; they are compiled to run at a specific, fixed memory address. Modern operating systems use Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to make it harder for attackers to exploit memory-related vulnerabilities. ASLR works by randomly changing the memory address of important parts of the program every time it&#x27;s loaded. This includes the base address of the program itself, shared libraries (DLLs), and memory areas like the heap and stack. ASLR rearranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap and libraries. By randomizing these memory addresses each time the process an application is loaded, ASLR prevents attackers from being able to reliably predict memory locations.

== .NET, metadata, and the PE format ==

In a .NET executable, the PE code section contains a stub that invokes the CLR virtual machine startup entry, codice_11 or codice_12 in codice_13, much like it was in Visual Basic executables. The virtual machine then makes use of .NET metadata present, the root of which, codice_14 (also called &quot;CLR header&quot;) is pointed to by codice_15 (the entry was previously used for COM+ metadata in COM+ applications, hence the name) entry in the PE header&#x27;s data directory. codice_14 strongly resembles PE&#x27;s optional header, essentially playing its role for the CLR loader.

The CLR-related data, including the root structure itself, is typically contained in the common code section, codice_17. It is composed of a few directories: metadata, embedded resources, strong names and a few for native-code interoperability. Metadata directory is a set of tables that list all the distinct .NET entities in the assembly, including types, methods, fields, constants, events, as well as references between them and to other assemblies.

==Use on other operating systems==
The PE format is also used by ReactOS, an open-source operating system created to be binary-compatible with Windows. Historically, it has also been used by other operating systems such as SkyOS and BeOS R3. However, both SkyOS and BeOS eventually moved to ELF.

The Mono development platform, which aims to be binary compatible with the Microsoft .NET Framework, uses the same PE format as the Microsoft implementation. The same goes for Microsoft&#x27;s own cross-platform .NET Core.

On x86(-64) Unix-like operating systems, Windows binaries (in PE format) can be executed using Wine. The HX DOS Extender also uses the PE format for native DOS 32-bit binaries, and can execute some Windows binaries in DOS, thus acting like an equivalent of Wine for DOS.

Mac OS X 10.5 has the ability to load and parse PE files, although it does not maintain binary compatibility with Windows.

UEFI and EFI firmware use PE files as well as the Windows ABI x64 calling convention for applications.

<text>Lee Kuan Yew (born Harry Lee Kuan Yew; 16 September 1923 – 23 March 2015), often referred to by his initials LKY, was a Singaporean statesman, politician, and lawyer who served as the Minister Mentor between 2004 to 2011, Senior Minister between 1990 to 2004 and first prime minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. 

He served as the secretary-general of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) from 1954 to 1992 and was the member of Parliament (MP) for Tanjong Pagar from 1955 until his death in 2015. Lee is widely recognised as the founding father of the modern Singaporean state, and for his leadership in transforming it into a highly developed country during his tenure. 

Lee was born in Singapore during British colonial rule. After graduating from Raffles Institution, he won a scholarship to Raffles College, now the National University of Singapore. During the Japanese occupation, Lee escaped being the victim of a purge, before subsequently starting his own businesses while working as an administration service officer for the Japanese propaganda office. After World War II ended, Lee briefly attended the London School of Economics before transferring to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, to study law, graduating with a double first degree in 1947. He was called to the Bar from the Middle Temple in 1950. Upon his return to Singapore, he practised as an advocate and solicitor whilst campaigning for the British to relinquish their colonial rule.

Lee co-founded the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) in 1954 and won his first seat at the Tanjong Pagar division during the 1955 general election. He became the &quot;de facto&quot; opposition leader in parliament, to Chief Ministers David Marshall and Lim Yew Hock of the Labour Front. Lee led his party to its first electoral victory in 1959 and was appointed the state&#x27;s first prime minister. To attain complete home rule from Britain, Lee campaigned for a merger with other former British territories in a national referendum to form Malaysia in 1963. Racial strife and ideological differences later led to Singapore&#x27;s expulsion from Malaysia and subsequent independence in 1965, less than two years after the merger.

With overwhelming parliamentary control at every general election, Lee oversaw Singapore&#x27;s transformation into a developed country with a high-income economy within his premiership. In the process, he forged a highly effective, anti-corrupt government and civil service. Lee eschewed populist policies in favour of long-term social and economic planning, championing civic nationalism through meritocracy and multiracialism as governing principles, making English the lingua franca to integrate its immigrant society and to facilitate trade with the world, whilst mandating bilingualism in schools to preserve the students&#x27; mother tongue and ethnic identity. Lee stepped down as prime minister in 1990, but remained in the Cabinet under his successors, holding the appointments of Senior Minister until 2004, then Minister Mentor until 2011. He died of pneumonia on 23 March 2015, at the age of 91. In a week of national mourning, about 1.7 million residents and world leaders paid tribute to him at his lying-in-state at Parliament House and community tribute sites.

An advocate for Asian values and a proponent of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; pragmatism, Lee&#x27;s premiership was described as authoritarian by the Western world or as a sort of guided democracy by scholars and the media. He was criticised for curtailing press freedoms, imposing narrow limits on public protests, restricting labour movements from industrial or strike action through anti-union legislation and co-option, and bringing defamation lawsuits against prominent political opponents. Lee directly responded to such critiques by stating that &quot;If Singapore is a nanny state, then I am proud to have fostered one&quot;. In addition, others have argued that his actions were necessary and vital for the country&#x27;s early development. Lee has been often described a benevolent dictator who fostered social wellbeing within an illiberal democratic framework. Lee continues to be held in high regard by Singaporeans.

==Early life==
===Childhood and early education===

Lee was born on 16 September 1923, the first child of Lee Chin Koon, a Semarang-born Singaporean, and Chua Jim Neo, at 92 Kampong Java Road in Singapore, then part of the British Empire. Both of Lee&#x27;s parents were English-educated third-generation Straits Chinese, with his paternal side being of Hakka descent from Dabu County. He was named &#x27;Kuan Yew&#x27;, meaning &#x27;light and brightness&#x27;, alternately meaning &#x27;bringing great glory to one&#x27;s ancestors&#x27;. Lee&#x27;s paternal grandfather Lee Hoon Leong, who was described as &quot;especially westernised&quot;, had worked on British ships as a purser, and hence gave Lee the Western name &#x27;Harry&#x27;. While the family spoke English as its first language, Lee also learned Malay. Lee would have three brothers and one sister, all of whom lived to old age.

Lee was not close to his father, who worked as a storekeeper within the Shell Oil Company and had a gambling addiction. His mother Chua would often stand up against her husband for his poor financial management and parenting skills. The family was considered prosperous with a high social standing compared to recent immigrants and had the means to hire servants. During the Great Depression the family fortunes declined considerably, though Lee&#x27;s father retained his job at Shell. Later in life, Lee described his father as a man with a nasty temper and credited his mother with holding the family together amidst her husband&#x27;s gambling addiction.

In 1930, Lee enrolled at Telok Kurau English School where he spent six years of his primary education. Attending Raffles Institution in 1935, Lee did poorly in his first two years but later topped the Junior Cambridge examinations. He also joined the Scouts and partook in several physical activities and debates. Lee was the top scorer in the Senior Cambridge examinations in 1940 across the Straits Settlements and Malaya, gaining the John Anderson scholarship to attend Raffles College. During the prize-awarding ceremony, Lee met his future wife Kwa Geok Choo; she was the only girl at the school. His subsequent university studies at Raffles College were disrupted by the onset of World War II in Asia, with the school being converted into a medical facility in 1941. The war arrived in December of that year and following the British surrender in February 1942, the Japanese occupation of Singapore began.

===World War II===
Lee was amongst the Chinese men rounded up by the Japanese &quot;Sook Ching&quot; operation. By his own account, he feared getting caught by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; (military police) and reported with a friend to be screened. He attempted to leave the next morning but was ordered to join a group of already segregated men. Lee requested to collect his clothes first and managed to spend a second night in the dormitory before successfully leaving the site the next day when a different guard cleared him through. He later learned that the group of men were likely taken to the beach and executed.

Lee obtained a Japanese language proficiency certificate in August 1942 and worked in a friend&#x27;s company and then the &quot;Kumiai&quot;, which controlled essential items. He got a job with the Japanese propaganda department (&quot;Hōdōbu&quot;) in late 1943 and worked for the Japanese occupation force as an English specialist. Working at the top of the Cathay Building, he was assigned to listen to Allied radio stations for Morse code signals. By late 1944, Lee knew Japan had suffered major setbacks and planned to move to the Cameron Highlands with his family to avoid a possible British invasion. He was tipped off that he was being followed and abandoned the plan. He engaged in private enterprises and black market sales for the rest of the war. During this time, Lee helped develop a glue based on tapioca, which he sold under the name Stikfas. The Stikfas logo later appeared on the base of his wedding cake.

The rapid Japanese victory in the Malaya-Singapore campaign had a major impact on Lee as he recalled: &quot;In 70 days of surprises, upsets and stupidities, British colonial society was shattered, and with it all the assumptions of the Englishman&#x27;s superiority&quot;. In a radio broadcast made in 1961, Lee said he &quot;emerged [from the war] determined that no one—neither Japanese nor British—had the right to push and kick us around... (and) that we could govern ourselves.&quot; It also influenced his perceptions of raw power and the effectiveness of harsh punishment in deterring crime.

===University, marriage and politics===
Lee chose not to return to Raffles College after the war and pursued higher education in the United Kingdom. He sailed from Singapore on his 23rd birthday on the MV &quot;Britannic&quot;, arriving in the UK on 3 October. He initially enrolled at the London School of Economics, but found himself disliking life in the British capital. He visited Cambridge in November and was introduced to W. S. Thatcher, Censor of Fitzwilliam House. He was admitted into the following year&#x27;s Lent term and matriculated in January 1947, reading law at Fitzwilliam College.

Prior to his departure from Singapore, Lee had begun a relationship with Kwa, whom he had kept in contact during the war. They married in secret at Stratford-upon-Avon in December. Lee achieved a first class result in both the Prelims and Part I of the Tripos, and graduated with a Starred First for Part II Law in 1949. As the top student of his cohort, he was awarded the Fitzwilliam&#x27;s Whitlock Prize; Lee was called to the Bar from the Middle Temple in 1950.

During his studies, Lee&#x27;s political convictions and anti-colonial sentiments were hardened by personal experiences and an increasing belief that the British were ruling Singapore for their own benefit. He supported the Labour Party against the Conservatives whom he perceived as opposing decolonisation. In the leadup to the 1950 United Kingdom general election, Lee engaged in politics for the first time and actively campaigned for a friend, David Widdicombe in Totnes constituency, driving Widdicombe around in a lorry and delivering several speeches on his behalf.

Before returning to Singapore, Lee dropped his English name, Harry. Notwithstanding, even until the end of his life, old friends and relatives referred to him as Harry.

==Early career (1951–1955)==
===Litigation practice===
Lee and his wife returned to Singapore in August 1950 on board the MS &quot;Willem Ruys&quot;. He joined the Laycock and Ong law firm founded by British lawyer John Laycock. Laycock was a co-founder of the pro-British Progressive Party and Lee represented the party during the 1951 legislative council election as an election agent. Lee was called to the Singapore bar on 7 August 1951.

During the postal union strike in May 1952, Lee negotiated a settlement which would mark his first step into the labour movement. In due course, Lee represented nearly fifty trade unions and associations against the British authorities on a &quot;pro bono&quot; basis. The disputes often centered around wages and Laycock eventually requested Lee to cease taking on such cases as it was hurting the firm.

In May 1954, the left-wing University Socialist Club published an article &#x27;Aggression in Asia&#x27; in the club&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Fajar&quot;, and the student editors were charged with sedition. Lee became junior counsel to Denis Pritt. The court quashed the charges and the two counsel gained a reputation through the trial, with Lee thereafter becoming a &quot;major leader&quot; of the movement against British rule. During the same year, Lee also appealed on behalf of the students arrested during the 13 May incident. The colonial government upheld the sentences, though the case enhanced Lee&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;left-wing lawyer&quot; and marked his first involvement with the Chinese intelligentsia.

===Forming the PAP===
During his studies in Britain, Lee met Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye via the Malayan Forum. The forum sought to promote an independent Malaya which included Singapore and met at 44 Bryanston Square in London. Lee and his contemporaries deliberately avoided the topic of forming a political party to avoid charges of subversion, beginning work on forming a political party only after returning to Singapore.

Lee had sought to build support among the English-educated, Malay, and Indian communities by taking on cases against the British authorities. In the course of his work, Lee became acquainted with the journalist Sinnathamby Rajaratnam; Abdul Samad Ismail, a writer for the Malay newspaper &quot;Utusan Melayu&quot;; and Devan Nair. He next turned his attention to the Chinese-speaking majority and was introduced to Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan, leaders of the influential bus and factories unions. While the unions had been infiltrated by communists, Lee consciously sought their support as he wanted a popular front. With elections approaching in 1955, Lee and his associates debated the name, ideology, and policies of the party they wanted to create at 38 Oxley Road.

The People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) was inaugurated on 21 November 1954 at the Victoria Memorial Hall. As the party still lacked members, trade union leaders rounded up an estimated audience of 800 to 1,500 supporters. Lee had also invited Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tan Cheng Lock, presidents of the United Malays National Organisation and Malayan Chinese Association. In his inaugural speech, Lee denounced the British for the slow transition to self-rule, demanded their immediate withdrawal, and said that the PAP would pursue a Singapore-Malaya union. Lee became secretary-general of the party, a post he held until 1992, barring a brief period in 1957 when the post was taken up by T. T. Rajah.

In July 1953, Governor John Nicoll initiated the Rendel Commission to provide for a transition to self-rule. The commission created the legislative assembly and opened 25 of 32 seats for direct contest in the upcoming 1955 election. The PAP and Labour Front, led by Lee and David Marshall respectively, both criticised the concessions as &quot;inadequate&quot;. The PAP faced manpower constraints but decided to prioritise resources and contest four seats as a protest gesture. In a rally speech, Lee said he chose the Tanjong Pagar division as it was a &quot;working class area&quot; and that he did not want to represent &quot;wealthy merchants or landlords&quot;.

During the campaigning period, the British press labelled Lee as a &quot;commissar&quot; and accused the PAP of being a &quot;communist-backed party&quot;. Democratic Party (DP) challenger Lam Thian also capitalised on Lee&#x27;s inability to converse in Chinese. Lee&#x27;s proposal for a multilingual debate was never reciprocated by Thian, though he eventually made his maiden Chinese speech after several hours of coaching. On polling day, 2 April, the ruling Progressive Party captured only four seats, shocking both the British establishment and its opposition. Lee defeated his competitors and won Tanjong Pagar, with the PAP winning three of their four contested seats. He pledged to work with Marshall and the new Labour Front government.

As independent member Ahmad Ibrahim joined PAP following the election, PAP had 4 members in the Assembly and thus Lee became the new Leader of the Opposition.

==Leader of the Opposition (1955–1959)==
===Strikes and power struggle===
On 23 April 1955, workers from the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company began a strike under the direction of Fong Swee Suan, leader of the Singapore Buses Workers&#x27; Union (SBWU). As SBWU&#x27;s legal advisor, Lee worked with Marshall&#x27;s government to negotiate a resolution, which was initially agreed by the SBWU but then reneged on by the company. Seeking to exert greater pressure, Lee, Fong and Lim Chin Siong addressed the strikers on 1 May (May Day), where Lee called the government a &quot;half-past six democracy&quot;. The strike subsequently escalated into a riot on 12 May.

Lee, Marshall and the company agreed on a further resolution on 14 May, which conceded to several of the strikers&#x27; demands. In an emergency legislative assembly sitting on 16 May, Chief Secretary William Goode accused Lee of losing control of the PAP to Lim. Lee was constrained between defending the actions of his colleagues and denouncing them, instead reiterating the PAP&#x27;s committal to non-violence. Marshall defended him and the PAP as &quot;decent men&quot; against Goode&#x27;s accusations and called upon the party to &quot;purge themselves of communists&quot;.

The riot led the public to perceive the PAP as being led by &quot;young, immature and troublesome politicians&quot;, resulting in a shortfall of new members. It deepened the divide between two emerging factions, with Lee&#x27;s faction advocating Fabian&#x27;s brand of socialism for gradual reform and Lim&#x27;s faction, later described by Fong as &quot;favour(ing) a more radical approach&quot;. Lee was convinced that Lim and Fong&#x27;s influence were pushing the party toward &quot;political disaster&quot;. After consulting his allies Toh Chin Chye, S. Rajaratnam and Byrne, Lee censured the two men privately and demanded they change strategies or leave the party.

By 1956, Lee believed that the PAP &quot;had been captured by the communists&quot; and privately endorsed the Labour Front government purge of suspected &quot;leftists&quot; in the aftermath of the 1956 Chinese middle schools riots. The arrestees included his rival Lim and several other PAP members. When other leftist members captured six seats in the PAP central executive committee (CEC) elections on 4 August 1957, Lee refused to allow his allies to assume their appointments and said that his faction had &quot;lost their moral right&quot; to enforce the party&#x27;s founding philosophy. Overtures were made by fellow CEC member T. T. Rajah to remain in his post, to which he declined. The government arrested the leftist leaders on 22 August and Lee was restored as secretary-general on 20 October. He later blamed the attempted takeover on lax admission rules to the party and permanently distrusted the leftists thereafter. On 23 November 1958, the party constitution was amended to implement a cadre system. The right to vote in party elections and run for office were revoked from ordinary party members, whom now had to seek approval from the CEC to be a cadre and regain these privileges. Lee credited the Vatican system where the pope pre-selects its cardinals for the idea.

===Merdeka talks===
The Labour Front government&#x27;s conciliatory approach to the Hock Lee strikers led to a drastic increase in strikes. Frustrated by his limited powers, Marshall demanded further constitutional reforms towards the aim of &quot;true self-government&quot;. Lee supported Marshall in his efforts, though he initially threatened an opposition boycott over wording disputes in the agreement.

Between 1956 and 1958, there would be three rounds of constitutional talks. Lee was part of Marshall&#x27;s 13-member delegation to London in April 1956. Marshall&#x27;s demands for independence were repeatedly rejected by Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd and Lee departed early over Marshall&#x27;s refusal to compromise. He criticised Marshall for his &quot;political ineptitude&quot; in the British press and received widespread media and radio coverage. He returned to London in March 1957 as part of a five-member delegation led by the new chief minister Lim Yew Hock. Britain conceded to Singapore&#x27;s self-governance but also demanded that a tripartite Internal Security Council be established, which proved controversial back home. Marshall challenged Lee to seek a fresh mandate from his Tanjong Pagar constituents, which Lee accepted. In the June 1957 by-elections, Lee was reelected with 68.1% of the vote.

Lee returned to London for the third and final talks in May 1958, where it was agreed that Singapore would assume self-governance with a Yang di-Pertuan Negara as head of state, with Britain retaining control of defence and foreign policy. The British House of Lords passed the State of Singapore Act on 24 July 1958, which received royal assent on 1 August, and would become law following the next general election.

===1957 and 1959 elections===
As the 1957 City Council election in December approached, a Hokkien-speaking candidate, Ong Eng Guan, became the PAP&#x27;s new face to the Chinese electorate. The 32-seat city council&#x27;s functions were restricted to up-keeping public amenities within city limits, but party leaders decided to contest the election as a &quot;dry run&quot; for the upcoming general election. Lee limited the PAP to contesting 14 seats to avoid provoking the government and formed an electoral pact with the Labour Front and United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) to jointly tackle the new Liberal Socialist Party. The PAP campaigned on a slogan to &quot;sweep the city clean&quot; and emerged with 13 seats, allowing it to form a minority administration with UMNO&#x27;s support. Lee and the rest of the CEC unanimously endorsed Ong to become mayor.

Early in 1959, Communications and Works Minister Francis Thomas received evidence of corruption on Education Minister Chew Swee Kee. Thomas brought the evidence to Lee after the chief minister dismissed the matter. Lee tabled a motion in the assembly on 17 February, which forced Chew&#x27;s resignation. As the expiry of the assembly&#x27;s term approached, the PAP was initially split on whether to capture power but Lee chose to proceed. While picking the candidates, Lee deliberately chose people from different racial and education backgrounds to repair the party&#x27;s image of being run by intellectuals. In the 1959 general election held on 30 May 1959, the PAP won a landslide victory with 43 of the 51 seats, though with only 53.4% of the popular vote which Lee noted.

The PAP&#x27;s victory reportedly created a dilemma within the 12-member CEC as there was no formal process in place to choose a prime minister-elect. A vote was purportedly held between Lee and Ong Eng Guan and after both men received six votes, party chairman Toh Chin Chye cast the tie-breaking vote for Lee. When interviewed nearly five decades later, Toh and one other party member recalled the vote, but Lee and several others denied the account. Lee was summoned by Governor William Goode to form a new government on 1 June, to which he requested the release of arrested PAP members. On 3 June, Singapore became a self-governing state, ending 140 years of direct British rule. Lee was sworn in as Prime Minister of Singapore on 5 June at City Hall, along with the rest of his Cabinet.

==Prime Minister, State of Singapore (1959–1963)==
===First years in power===


Lee&#x27;s first speech as prime minister to a 50,000-strong audience at the Padang sought to dampen his supporters&#x27; euphoria of the PAP&#x27;s electoral win. In the first month of Lee taking power, Singapore experienced an economic slump as foreign capital fell and Western businesses and expatriates left for Kuala Lumpur in Malaya, fearing the new government&#x27;s anti-colonial zeal. As part of an &#x27;anti-yellow culture&#x27; drive, Lee banned jukeboxes and pinball machines, while the police under Home Affairs Minister Ong Pang Boon raided pubs and pornography publications. The government cracked down on secret societies, prostitution and other illegal activities, with &quot;TIME&quot; magazine later reporting that a full week passed without &quot;kidnapping, extortion or gangland rumble(s)&quot; for the first time. Lee also spearheaded several &#x27;mobilisation campaigns&#x27; to clean the city, introduced air-conditioning to government offices, and slashed the salaries of civil servants. The last act provoked anger from the sector, which Lee justified as necessary to balance the budget.

In February 1960, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) superseded the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) and assumed responsibility of public housing. With strong government support, the HDB under chairman Lim Kim San completed more flats in three years than its predecessor did in thirty-two. Government expenditure for public utilities, healthcare and education also increased significantly. By the end of the year, however, unemployment began to rise drastically as the economy slowed. Lee reversed anti-colonial policies and launched a five-year plan to build new industries, seeking to attract foreign investors and rival Hong Kong. Jurong, a swampland to the island&#x27;s western coast was chosen to be the site of a new industrial estate and would house steel mills, shipyards, and oil refineries, though Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee was initially worried the venture would fail.

The government promoted multiculturalism by recognising Chinese, English, Malay, and Tamil as the official languages of the new state and sought to create a new national Malayan identity. The Ministry of Culture under S. Rajaratnam held free outdoor concerts with every ethnic race represented in the performances. Lee also introduced the People&#x27;s Association, a government-linked organisation to run community centers and youth clubs, with its leaders trained to spread the PAP&#x27;s ideology. Youth unemployment was alleviated by the establishment of work brigades.

===PAP split of 1961===
Lee took measures to secure his position in the aftermath of the 1957 party elections. In 1959, he delayed the release of leftist PAP members arrested under the former Labour Front government and appointed five of its leaders, including Lim Chin Siong, as parliamentary secretaries lacking political power. Lee clashed further with Lim when the government sought to create a centralised labour union in the first half of 1960. Trouble also arose from former mayor and Minister of National Development Ong Eng Guan, who Lee had appointed in recognition of Ong&#x27;s contribution to the PAP&#x27;s electoral win. Ong&#x27;s relocation of his ministry to his Hong Lim stronghold and continued castigation of the British and civil servants was regarded by his colleagues as disruptive and Lee removed several portfolios from Ong&#x27;s purview in February 1960.

In the party conference on 18 June 1960, Ong filed &quot;16 resolutions&quot; against the leadership, accusing Lee of failing to seek party consensus when deciding policy, not adhering to anti-colonialism and suspending left-wing unions. Lee regarded it as a move to split the party and together with his allies expelled Ong from the party. Ong resigned his seat in December, precipitating the Hong Lim by-election on in April 1961 which he won against a PAP candidate. The death of the PAP assemblyman for Anson that April triggered a second by-election. For the first time, Lim&#x27;s faction openly revolted against Lee and endorsed Workers&#x27; Party chairman David Marshall who won the seat.

Lee assumed responsibility for the two by-election defeats and submitted his resignation to party chairman Toh Chin Chye on 17 July. Toh rejected it and upheld Lee&#x27;s mandate. Lee moved a motion of confidence in his own government in the early hours of 21 July after a thirteen-hour debate which had begun the preceding day, narrowly surviving it with 27 &quot;Ayes&quot;, 8 &quot;Noes&quot; and 16 abstentions. The PAP now commanded a single seat majority in the 51-seat assembly after 13 of its members had abstained. Lee expelled the 13 who had broken ranks in addition to Lim, Fong and Woodhull.

===Leadup to referendum and merger===

Lee and his colleagues believed that Singapore could only survive through merger with Malaya and was unwilling to call for complete independence. Merger would allow goods to be exported to the peninsula under a common market, while devolving unpopular internal security measures to Kuala Lumpur. Malaya&#x27;s ruling Alliance Party coalition dominated by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) had repeatedly opposed the scheme and was apprehensive that Singapore&#x27;s Chinese majority would reduce &#x27;Malay political supremacy&#x27;. Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman backtracked after the PAP&#x27;s Hong Lim by-election defeat, fearing a &quot;pro-communist government&quot; in Singapore should Lee fall from power. On 27 May 1961, Tunku announced that Malaya, Singapore, and the British colonies of North Borneo and Sarawak should pursue &quot;political and economic cooperation&quot;. Lee endorsed the program six days later and commenced negotiations on the formation of Malaysia.

In August 1961, Lee and Tunku agreed that Singapore&#x27;s defence, foreign affairs and internal security would be transferred to the federal government, while education and labour policy remained with the state government. Lim Chin Siong and his supporters saw Lee&#x27;s ceding control of internal security—then controlled by the Internal Security Council with British, Malayan, Singaporean representatives—to the federal government as a threat as Tunku was convinced they were communists. In a meeting with British Commissioner General Lord Selkirk, Selkirk reaffirmed that the British would not suspend Singapore&#x27;s constitution should Lee be voted out. Lee saw the meeting as a British endorsement of Lim and accused it as a plot against his government. On 13 August, Lim founded the Barisan Sosialis and became its secretary-general, with 35 of 51 branches of the PAP defecting. Lee anticipated a Barisan win in the next election and saw &#x27;independence through merger&#x27; as the only means for the PAP to retain power.

Beginning on 13 September 1961, Lee gave twelve multilingual radio speeches outlining the benefits of merger in what he called the &#x27;Battle for Merger&#x27;. The speeches proved to be a massive success for Lee&#x27;s campaign, while Barisan&#x27;s demands for equal airtime were rejected. Lee employed full use of state resources to suppress his opponents by revoking the Barisan&#x27;s printing permits, banning or relocating its rallies, and purging its supporters from the government, while the judiciary and police engaged to &quot;obstruct, provoke and isolate&quot; the party. The Barisan lambasted Lee for securing only 15 seats in the Malaysian parliament for Singapore in contrast to North Borneo (16) and Sarawak (24), despite both having a combined population well below Singapore&#x27;s 1.7 million. Singapore citizens would also be categorised as &quot;nationals&quot; and not be granted Malaysian citizenship. On 6 December, the legislative assembly voted 33–0 in favour of the agreements struck by Lee and Tunku, which the Barisan boycotted.

A referendum for merger was scheduled for 1 September 1962. Lee ensured that the ballot lacked a &quot;no&quot; option, with all three options having varying terms for admission into Malaysia. The ballot was crafted by Lee and Goh Keng Swee to capitalise on a mistake which the Barisan had made the previous year. The Barisan had inadvertently endorsed merger under terms &quot;like Penang&quot; (a state of Malaya) with full citizenship rights, not realising that Malayan law entitled only a native-born to qualify for automatic citizenship, which would disenfranchise nearly one third of those eligible to vote; it issued a clarification but never recovered from the mistake. Lee placed the flag of Singapore alongside option A with the terms of Singapore retaining control of education and labour policy, while portraying the Barisan&#x27;s choice as option B favouring entry into the federation with no special rights, next to the flag of Penang. When Lim called for his supporters to submit blank votes, Lee countered that blank votes would count as a vote for the majority choice. 71% eventually voted for option A, while 26% cast blank votes. In November, Lee embarked on a ten-month visit to all fifty-one constituencies, prioritising those with the highest count of blank votes.

===Operation Coldstore detentions===

The Malayan government considered the arrests of Singapore&#x27;s left-wing groups as non-negotiable for the formation of Malaysia. Tunku felt that Lee lacked the initiative to suppress &quot;pro-communist elements&quot; and warned that a Malay-led dictatorship would be instated to prevent a &quot;socialist majority&quot; in the next Malayan election. As the Malayans increased pressure on the Internal Security Council (ISC) to take action, Lee began supporting the idea of a purge in March 1962. The Malayan and Singapore special branches collaborated on an arrest list of major opposition members, though doubts arose if Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan could be classified as &#x27;communists&#x27;. Up until the end of November 1962, the British declined to support the operation without a pretext, noting that Lim and the Barisan Sosialis had not broken any laws.

The Brunei revolt on 8 December led by A. M. Azahari provided a &quot;heaven-sent opportunity&quot; to take action, as Lim had met Azahari on 3 December. The Malayan government convened the ISC to discuss the operation, while Singapore&#x27;s Special Branch produced alleged evidence of the communist control of Barisan. On 13 December, Lord Selkirk gave his authorisation for the arrests to proceed on 16 December. However, Lee&#x27;s attempt to add two Malayan parliamentarians opposed to the formation of Malaysia into the arrest list caused the Malayan representative to rescind his consent, stopping the operation. Tunku suspected that Lee was trying to eliminate his entire opposition, while Lee felt that Tunku was evading his shared responsibility for the arrests.

An ISC meeting was scheduled to be held on 1 February 1963 to remount the operation. During the interim period, Lee had added three names from the United People&#x27;s Party, one of them being former PAP minister Ong Eng Guan. Selkirk expressed concerns that Ong&#x27;s arrest lacked any justification and Lee conceded that it was meant as a &quot;warning&quot; to Ong. Tunku told Geofroy Tory, the British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur on 30 January, that &#x27;if this operation failed, merger with Singapore was off&#x27;. Selkirk was pressured to put his reservations aside and finally consented. On 2 February, Operation Coldstore commenced across Singapore, with 113 detained including Lim and 23 others from Barisan Sosialis. Lee offered Lim a path into exile which Lim rejected. The Malayans and British later pressured Lee to retract his comment when he said he &quot;disapproved&quot; of the operation.

In his memoirs, Lee portrayed himself as reluctant in supporting the operation, though declassified British documents revealed that Lee was &quot;somewhat more enthusiastic&quot; than he eventually admitted.

==Prime Minister, Singapore in Malaysia (1963–1965)==
===Elections and tensions===

On 31 August 1963, Lee declared Singapore&#x27;s independence in a ceremony at the Padang and pledged loyalty to the federal government. With the conclusion of the trials of Barisan Sosialis&#x27; leaders, Lee dissolved the legislative assembly on 3 September and called for a snap election. He touted &quot;independence through merger&quot; as a success and utilised television and the mass media effectively. In conjunction with Sabah (formerly North Borneo) and Sarawak, Lee proclaimed Singapore as part of Malaysia in a second ceremony on 16 September accompanied by a military parade. Lim Chin Siong&#x27;s arrest had, however, generated widespread sympathy for the Barisan and a close result was predicted. Australian and British officials expected a Barisan win. When the PAP defeated the Barisan in a landslide victory on 21 September, it was seen as a public endorsement of merger and Lee&#x27;s socio-economic policies.

Relations between the PAP and Malaysia&#x27;s ruling Alliance Party quickly deteriorated as Lee began espousing his policies to the rest of the country. The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) was also shocked by the loss of three Malay-majority seats to the PAP in the recent 1963 Singapore election. Ultra-nationalists within UMNO alleged that Lee sought to overthrow the Malay monarchies and infringe on rural life. Lee&#x27;s attempts to reconcile the PAP with UMNO were rebuffed as the latter remained committed to the Malaysian Chinese Association. Further hostility ensued when the PAP decided to contest in the 1964 Malaysian general election in contravention of a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that it would disavow itself from peninsula politics. Lee&#x27;s speeches in Malaysia attracted large crowds and he expected the PAP to win at least seven parliamentary seats. The party ultimately won only one seat in Bangsar, Selangor under Devan Nair. Lee and other party insiders later conceded that UMNO&#x27;s portrayal of the PAP as a &quot;Chinese party&quot; and its lack of grassroots in the peninsula had undermined its support from the Malay majority.

Ethnic tensions had risen prior to the April election when UMNO secretary-general Syed Jaafar Albar utilised the &quot;Utusan Melayu&quot; to accuse Lee of evicting Malays from their homes in March 1964. Lee explained personally to the affected neighbourhoods that the scheme was part of an urban renewal plan and that eviction notices had been sent to everyone irrespective of race. Albar responded by warning Lee to not &quot;treat the sons of the soil as step-children&quot; and led calls for the deaths of Lee and Social Affairs Minister Othman bin Wok on 12 July. On 21 July, the 1964 race riots in Singapore erupted during a celebration of Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s birthday, lasting four days, killing 22 and injuring 461. Further riots occurred in late-August and early-September resulting in communities self-segregating from each other, which Lee characterised as &quot;terribly disheartening&quot; and against &quot;everything we had believed in and worked for&quot;. Lee never forgot the Malay PAP leaders who stood against UMNO during the turmoil and as late as 1998, paid tribute to them for Singapore&#x27;s survival.

===Malaysian Malaysia and separation===

Lee&#x27;s perceptions that merger was becoming infeasible was also due to the federal government&#x27;s obstruction of his industrialisation program and its imposition of new taxes on Singapore in November 1964. He authorised Goh Keng Swee to renegotiate with Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Razak Hussein on Singapore&#x27;s place in the federation in early 1965. Seeking to provide an alternative to the Alliance Party government, Lee and his colleagues formed the Malaysian Solidarity Convention (MSC) with the Malayan and Sarawakian opposition on 9 May, with its goals for a Malaysian Malaysia and race-blind society. The MSC was seen by UMNO as a threat to the Malay monopoly of power and special rights granted to Malays under Article 153. UMNO supreme council member and future prime minister Mahathir Mohamad called the PAP &quot;pro-Chinese, communist-oriented and positively anti-Malay&quot;, while others called for Lee&#x27;s arrest under the Internal Security Act for trying to split the federation. Mathathir in his speech stated the &quot;huaren&quot; (ethnic Chinese) of Singapore were of &quot;the insular, selfish and arrogant type of which Mr. Lee is a good example...They are in fact Chinese first, seeing China as the center of the world and Malaysia as a very poor second&quot;.

Such fears were sincerely felt by the UMNO leaders as one UMNO politician who was friendly with Lee privately told him: &quot;You Chinese are too energetic and clever for us...we cannot stand the pressure&quot;. Many UMNO politicians felt threatened by Lee, a politician who sought to appeal to both ethnic Chinese and Malay voters. Albar warned in a speech that the Malay voters of Singapore must have been &quot;misled&quot; into voting for the PAP, and the UNMO would not allow this to happen in the next election. Lee later wrote of Tunku that was &quot;a nice man&quot;, but &quot;he was a prince who understood power and knew how to use it. He did not carry a big stick, but he had many hatchet-bearers who would do the job for him while he looked the other way and appeared as benign as ever&quot;. Tunku was a Malay aristocrat who spent his undergraduate years at Cambridge by his own admission on &quot;fast women&quot; rather than studying and whom Lee contemptuously noted had been awarded a degree at Cambridge that he did not deserve solely because he was an aristocrat. Tunku in turn felt threatened by Lee, a man who had worked his way up via his intelligence and self-discipline, which made him very different from the people in his world.

On 26 May, Lee addressed the Malaysian parliament for the final time, delivering his speech entirely in the Malay language. He challenged the Alliance Party to commit itself to a Malaysian Malaysia and denounce its extremists, and also argued that the PAP could better uplift the livelihood of the Malays. Then-social affairs minister Othman Wok later recounted: &quot;I noticed that while he was speaking, the Alliance leaders sitting in front of us, they sank lower and lower because they were embarrassed this man (Lee) could speak Malay better than them&quot;. Then-national development minister Lim Kim San also noted: &quot;That was the turning point. They perceived [Lee] as a dangerous man who could one day be the prime minister of Malaya. This was the speech that changed history.&quot; Prime Minister Tunku labelled the speech as the final straw which contributed to his decision on 29 June that Singapore&#x27;s secession was necessary. The more extreme UMNO politicians such as Albar were pressing to have Lee arrested and martial law proclaimed, but Tunku chose to accept Singapore&#x27;s secession instead. The British Prime Minister Harold Wilson also quietly pressured Tunku to accept Singapore&#x27;s secession and warned him against a declaration of martial law. As Britain was defending Malaysia from Indonesian attempts to annex the country, Britain was in a strong position to apply pressure on Malaysia. Lee in his memoirs stated that Singapore owed Wilson a major debt for his role in pressuring Tunku for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.

Lee summoned Law Minister E. W. Barker to draft documents effecting Singapore&#x27;s separation from the federation and its proclamation of independence. To ensure that a 1962 agreement to draw water from Johor was retained, Lee insisted that it be enshrined in the separation agreement and Malaysian constitution. The negotiations of post-separation relations were held in utmost secrecy and Lee tried to prevent secession until he was persuaded to finally relent by Goh on 7 August. That day, Lee and several cabinet ministers signed the separation agreement at Razak&#x27;s home, which stipulated continued co-operation in trade and mutual defence. He returned to Singapore the following day and convened the rest of his cabinet to sign the document, whereupon it was flown back to Kuala Lumpur.

On 9 August 1965 at 10am, Tunku convened the Malaysian parliament and moved the Constitution of Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Bill 1965, which passed unanimously by a vote of 126–0 with no PAP representatives present. Singapore&#x27;s independence was announced locally via radio at the same time and Lee broke the news to senior diplomats and civil servants. In a televised press conference that day, Lee fought back tears and briefly stopped to regain his composure as he formally announced the news to an anxious population:
==Prime Minister, Republic of Singapore (1965–1990)==

Despite the momentous event, Lee did not call for the parliament to convene to reconcile issues that Singapore would face immediately as a new nation. Without giving further instructions on who should act in his absence, he went into isolation for six weeks, unreachable by phone, on an isolated chalet. According to then-deputy prime minister Toh Chin Chye, the parliament hung in &quot;suspended animation&quot; until the sitting in December that year.

In his memoirs, Lee said that he was unable to sleep. Upon learning of Lee&#x27;s condition from the British High Commissioner to Singapore, John Robb, the British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, expressed concern, in response to which Lee replied:
Lee began to seek international recognition of Singapore&#x27;s independence. Singapore joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, and founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 8 August 1967 with four other South-East Asian countries. Lee made his first official visit to Indonesia on 25 May 1973, just a few years after the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation under Sukarno&#x27;s regime. Relations between Singapore and Indonesia substantially improved as subsequent visits were made between the two countries.

Singapore has never had a dominant culture to which immigrants could assimilate even though Malay was the dominant language at that time. Together with efforts from the government and ruling party, Lee tried to create a unique Singaporean identity in the 1970s and 1980s—one which heavily recognised racial consciousness within the umbrella of multiculturalism.

Lee and his government stressed the importance of maintaining religious tolerance and racial harmony, and they were ready to use the law to counter any threat that might incite ethnic and religious violence. For example, Lee warned against &quot;insensitive evangelisation&quot;, by which he referred to instances of Christian proselytising directed at Malays. In 1974 the government advised the Bible Society of Singapore to stop publishing religious material in Malay.

===Defence===
The vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt, with threats from multiple sources including the communists and Indonesia with its confrontational stance. Adding to this vulnerability was the impending withdrawal of British forces from East of Suez. As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations, Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapore&#x27;s independence. He appointed Goh Keng Swee as Minister for the Interior and Defence to build up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and requested help from other countries, particularly Israel and Taiwan, for advice, training and facilities. In 1967, Lee introduced conscription for all able-bodied male Singaporean citizens 18 years of age to serve National Service (NS) either in the SAF, Singapore Police Force or the Singapore Civil Defence Force. By 1971, Singapore had 17 national service battalions (16,000 men) with 14 battalions (11,000 men) in the reserves. In 1975, Lee and Republic of China premier Chiang Ching-kuo signed an agreement permitting Singaporean troops to train in Taiwan, under the codename &quot;Project Starlight&quot;.

===Economy===
One of Lee&#x27;s most urgent tasks upon Singapore&#x27;s independence was to address high unemployment. Together with his economic aide, Economic Development Board chairman Hon Sui Sen, and in consultation with Dutch economist Albert Winsemius, Lee set up factories and initially focused on the manufacturing industry. Before the British completely withdrew from Singapore in 1971, Lee also persuaded the British not to destroy their dock and had the British naval dockyard later converted for civilian use.

Eventually, Lee and his cabinet decided the best way to boost Singapore&#x27;s economy was to attract foreign investments from multinational corporations (MNCs). By establishing First World infrastructure and standards in Singapore, the new nation could attract American, Japanese and European entrepreneurs and professionals to set up base there. By the 1970s, the arrival of MNCs like Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard and General Electric laid the foundations, turning Singapore into a major electronics exporter the following decade. Workers were frequently retrained to familiarise themselves with the work systems and cultures of foreign companies. The government also started several new industries, such as steel mills under &#x27;National Iron and Steel Mills&#x27;, service industries like Neptune Orient Lines, and the Singapore Airlines.

Lee and his cabinet also worked to establish Singapore as an international financial centre. Foreign bankers were assured of the reliability of Singapore&#x27;s social conditions, with top-class infrastructure and skilled professionals, and investors were made to understand that the Singapore government would pursue sound macroeconomic policies, with budget surpluses, leading to a stable valued Singapore dollar.

Throughout the tenure of his office, Lee placed great importance on developing the economy, and his attention to detail on this aspect went even to the extent of connecting it with other facets of Singapore, including the country&#x27;s extensive and meticulous tending of its international image of being a &quot;Garden City&quot;, something that has been sustained to this day.

===Anti-corruption measures===
Lee introduced legislation giving the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) greater power to conduct arrests, search, call up witnesses, and investigate bank accounts and income-tax returns of suspected persons and their families. Lee believed that ministers should be well paid in order to maintain a clean and honest government. On 21 November 1986, Lee received a complaint of corruption against then Minister for National Development Teh Cheang Wan. Lee authorised the CPIB to carry out investigations on Teh, but Teh committed suicide before any charges could be pressed against him. In 1994, he proposed to link the salaries of ministers, judges, and top civil servants to the salaries of top professionals in the private sector, arguing that this would help recruit and retain talent to serve in the public sector.

===Population policies===
In the late 1960s, fearing that Singapore&#x27;s growing population might overburden the developing economy, Lee started a &quot;Stop at Two&quot; family planning campaign. Couples were urged to undergo sterilisation after their second child. Third or fourth children were given lower priorities in education and such families received fewer economic rebates.

In 1983, Lee sparked the &quot;Great Marriage Debate&quot; when he encouraged Singapore men to choose highly educated women as wives. He was concerned that a large number of graduate women were unmarried. Some sections of the population, including graduate women, were upset by his views. Nevertheless, a match-making agency, the Social Development Unit (SDU), was set up to promote socialising among men and women graduates. In the Graduate Mothers Scheme, Lee also introduced incentives such as tax rebates, schooling, and housing priorities for graduate mothers who had three or four children, in a reversal of the over-successful &quot;Stop at Two&quot; family planning campaign in the 1960s and 1970s.

Lee suggested that perhaps the campaign for women&#x27;s rights had been too successful:

The uproar over the proposal led to a swing of 12.9 per cent against the PAP government in the 1984 general election. In 1985, some especially controversial portions of the policy, that gave education and housing priorities to educated women, were abandoned or modified.

By the late 1990s the birth rate had fallen so low that Lee&#x27;s successor Goh Chok Tong extended these incentives to all married women, and gave even more incentives, such as the &quot;baby bonus&quot; scheme.

===Water resources===
Singapore has traditionally relied on water from Malaysia. However, this reliance has made Singapore subject to the possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as political leverage by threatening to cut off supply. To reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974. As a result of such efforts, Singapore has achieved self-sufficiency with its water supply since the mid-2010s.

Under Lee tree planting was pursued, in 1963 he began a tree-planting campaign which aimed to plant 10,000 saplings a year and in 1971 a &#x27;Tree-Planting Day&#x27; was established. One of the goals of this was to increase rainfall. He also made efforts to clean Singapore&#x27;s waters for collection and use.
===Environment===
Lee envisioned Singapore as a garden city, declaring that &quot;no other hallmark of success will be more distinctive than that of achieving our position as the cleanest and greenest city in Southeast Asia&quot;. He would later say that &quot;greening is the most cost-effective project I have launched&quot;.

Lee set up an &#x27;Anti-Pollution Unit&#x27; stating that its importance resided in giving citizens &quot;respite from city centres&quot; and in the small size of Singapore which made it necessary to &quot;preserve a clean and gracious environment for rich and poor alike&quot;. In 1995 Lee declared &quot;I have always believed that a blighted urban landscape, a concrete jungle, destroys the human spirit. We need the greenery of nature to lift our spirits&quot;.

Lee saw this as a means of attracting tourists and businesspeople to the city. He wrote that &quot;without a word being said, they would know that Singaporeans were competent, disciplined, and reliable, a people who would learn the skills they required soon enough&quot;. After independence Lee sought for &quot;some dramatic way to distinguish ourselves from other Third World countries. I settled for a clean and green Singapore&quot; because &quot;if we had First World standards then business people and tourists would make us a base for their business and tours of the region&quot;.

Lee considered air conditioning the most important invention of the 20th century for Singapore. Air quality relates to work quality and as such Lee made sure air conditioning was installed in the offices of the Singaporean civil service in the 1960s.

===Foreign policy===
====Malaysia and Mahathir Mohamad====
Lee looked forward to improving relationships with Mahathir Mohamad upon the latter&#x27;s promotion to Deputy Prime Minister. Knowing that Mahathir was in line to become the next Prime Minister of Malaysia, Lee invited Mahathir to visit Singapore in 1978. The first and subsequent visits improved both personal and diplomatic relationships between them. Then UMNO&#x27;s Secretary-General Mahathir asked Lee to cut off all links with the Democratic Action Party; in exchange, Mahathir undertook not to interfere in the affairs of Malay Singaporeans.

In June 1988, Lee and Mahathir reached an agreement in Kuala Lumpur to build the Linggui dam on the Johor River. Lee said he had made more progress solving bilateral issues with Dr Mahathir from 1981 to 1990 than in the previous 12 years with the latter&#x27;s two predecessors. Mahathir ordered the lifting of the ban on the export of construction materials to Singapore in 1981, agreed to sort out Malaysia&#x27;s claim to Pedra Branca island and affirmed it would honour the 1962 Water Agreement.

One day before Lee left office in November 1990, Malaysia and Singapore signed the Malaysia–Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990 (POA). Malayan Railways (KTM) would vacate the Tanjong Pagar railway station and move to Bukit Timah while all KTM&#x27;s land between Bukit Timah and Tanjong Pagar would revert to Singapore. Railway land at Tanjong Pagar would be handed over to a private limited company for joint development, the equity of which would be divided 60% to Malaysia and 40% to Singapore. However, Prime Minister Mahathir expressed his displeasure with the POA, for it failed to include a piece of railway land in Bukit Timah for joint development in 1993.

Following Lee&#x27;s death, Mahathir posted a blog post that suggested his respect for Lee despite their differences, stating that while &quot;I am afraid on most other issues we could not agree [...] [h]is passage marks the end of the period when those who fought for independence lead their countries and knew the value of independence. ASEAN lost a strong leadership after President Suharto and Lee Kuan Yew&quot;.

====United States====
In his book &quot;The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew&quot;, Lee detailed an incident where in 1960, the CIA allegedly attempted to bribe certain members of his party, the PAP, in an attempt to create division and weaken his leadership, however the official had reported the bribery attempt instead of accepting the money. According to Lee, this was part of a broader strategy by the United States to influence the political landscape in Southeast Asia during the Cold War. He mentioned that he confronted the CIA&#x27;s representative in Singapore and demanded an explanation and compensation for this interference. After having two CIA agents arrested, Lee requested 3.5 million dollars in economic aid in exchange for the covert release of the two agents. The Americans rejected this offer and presented a counter-offer of 3.3 million dollars to be given directly to Lee and the People&#x27;s Action Party, but the men were later released without any financial exchange. However instead of taking a passive approach, Lee negotiated with the CIA and eventually the US government agreed to pay a sum of 3.3 million dollars in formal economic aid to Singapore, which Lee claimed was to ensure that the U.S. would not interfere in Singapore&#x27;s internal affairs. Lee revealed this incident in 1965, which led to the Americans to deny it ever occurred; however, Lee later made public a letter of apology from the US Secretary of State Dean Rusk over the incident.
Lee fully supported the US involvement in the Vietnam War. Even as the war began to lose its popularity in the United States, Lee made his first official visit to the United States in October 1967, and declared to President Lyndon B. Johnson that his support for the war in Vietnam was &quot;unequivocal&quot;. Lee saw the war as necessary for states in Southeast Asia like Singapore to buy time for stabilising their governments and economies. Lee cultivated close relationships with presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, as well as former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. In 1967 Nixon, who was running for president in 1968, visited Singapore and met with Lee, who advised that the United States had much to gain by engaging with China, culminating in Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China.

In the 1980s, closer defence relations between Singapore and the United States enabled Singapore to acquire advanced American weapon platforms and capabilities. The United States provided Singapore with aircraft such as the F-16 and the E-2C airborne early warning (AEW) to strengthen its air defences.

In October 1985, Lee made a state visit to the United States on the invitation of President Reagan and addressed a joint session of the United States Congress. Lee stressed to Congress the importance of free trade and urged it not to turn towards protectionism:

In May 1988, E. Mason &quot;Hank&quot; Hendrickson was serving as the First Secretary of the United States Embassy when he was expelled by the Singapore government. The Singapore government alleged that Hendrickson attempted to interfere in Singapore&#x27;s internal affairs by cultivating opposition figures in a &quot;Marxist conspiracy&quot;. Then-First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong claimed that Hendrickson&#x27;s alleged conspiracy could have resulted in the election of 20 or 30 opposition politicians to Parliament, which in his words could lead to &quot;horrendous&quot; effects, possibly even the paralysis and fall of the Singapore government. In the aftermath of Hendrickson&#x27;s expulsion, the U.S. State Department praised Hendrickson&#x27;s performance in Singapore and denied any impropriety in his actions. The State Department also expelled Robert Chua, a senior-level Singaporean diplomat equal in rank to Hendrickson, from Washington, D.C., in response. The State Department&#x27;s refusal to reprimand Hendrickson, along with its expulsion of the Singaporean diplomat, sparked a rare protest in Singapore by the National Trades Union Congress; they drove buses around the U.S. embassy, held a rally attended by four thousand workers, and issued a statement deriding the U.S. as &quot;sneaky, arrogant, and untrustworthy&quot;.

====China====
Singapore did not establish diplomatic relations with China until the U.S. and Southeast Asia had decided they wanted to do so in order to avoid portraying a pro-China bias. His official visits to China starting in 1976 were conducted in English, to assure other countries that he represented Singapore, and not a &quot;Third China&quot; (the first two being the Republic of China and People&#x27;s Republic of China).

In November 1978, after China had stabilised following political turmoil in the aftermath of Mao Zedong&#x27;s death and the Gang of Four, Deng Xiaoping visited Singapore and met Lee. Deng, who was very impressed with Singapore&#x27;s economic development, greenery and housing, and later sent tens of thousands of Chinese to Singapore and countries around the world to learn from their experiences and bring back their knowledge as part of the opening of China beginning in December 1978. Lee, on the other hand, advised Deng to stop exporting Communist ideologies to Southeast Asia, an advice that Deng later followed. This culminated in the exchange of Trade Offices between the two nations in September 1981. In 1985, commercial air services between mainland China and Singapore commenced and China appointed Goh Keng Swee, Singapore&#x27;s finance minister in the post-independence years, as advisor on the development of Special Economic Zones.

On 3 October 1990, Singapore revised diplomatic relations from the Republic of China to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

====Cambodia====
Lee opposed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978. The Singapore government organised an international campaign to condemn Vietnam and provided aid to the Khmer Rouge which was fighting against Vietnamese occupation during the Cambodian–Vietnamese War from 1978 to 1989. In his memoirs, Lee recounted that in 1982, &quot;Singapore gave the first few hundreds of several batches of AK-47 rifles, hand grenades, ammunition and communication equipment&quot; to the Khmer Rouge resistance forces.

==Senior Minister (1990–2004)==

After leading the PAP to victory in seven elections, Lee stepped down on 28 November 1990, handing over the prime ministership to Goh Chok Tong. By that time, he had become the world&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister. This was the first leadership transition since independence. Goh was elected as the new Prime Minister by the younger ministers then in office. When Goh Chok Tong became head of government, Lee remained in the cabinet with a non-executive position of Senior Minister and played a role he described as advisory. Lee subsequently stepped down as secretary-general of the PAP and was succeeded by Goh Chok Tong on 2 December 1992.

=== Condominium rebates ===

In April 1996, Lee and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, disclosed that they had purchased apartments located at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28 from Hotel Properties Ltd, a real estate developer listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore, at substantial discounts ranging from 5 to 12 per cent. The dispute arose amidst rampant property speculation in Singapore. Upon learning of the issue, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong swiftly initiated an immediate investigation into the matter. While Singapore law permits the provision of special discounts or rebates to relatives and associates of directors, it is imperative that such transactions receive approval from shareholders.

This disclosure prompted sufficient public disquiet for Lee to appear before Parliament to explain the purchases. Lee said that as he was a prominent figure, the developer had a &quot;legitimate incentive&quot; to provide discounts for publicity, and that he had previously purchased a car and acquired services from his tailor and cobbler at a discount. The amount saved was donated to charity.

==Minister Mentor (2004–2011)==
In December 2004, Lee stepped down to become Minister Mentor. Expressing concern about the declining proficiency of Mandarin among younger Chinese Singaporeans, he started a year-long campaign called &quot;&quot; (Mandarin is Cool!) to garner interest in using Mandarin.

On 13 September 2008, Lee underwent treatment for abnormal heart rhythm (atrial flutter) at Singapore General Hospital. The treatment was successful, and he was well enough to address a philanthropy forum via video link from the hospital. On 28 September 2010, he was hospitalised for a chest infection, cancelling plans to attend the wake of the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Balaji Sadasivan.

In November 2010, Lee&#x27;s private conversations with James Steinberg, US Deputy Secretary of State, on 30 May 2009 were among the leaked US Embassy cables. In a US Embassy report classified as &quot;Secret&quot;, Lee gave his assessment of a number of Asian leaders and views on political developments in North Asia, including implications for nuclear proliferation.

In January 2011, the Straits Times Press published the book &quot;Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths To Keep Singapore Going&quot;. Targeted at younger Singaporeans, it was based on 16 interviews with Lee by seven local journalists in 2008–2009. The first print run of 45,000 copies sold out in less than a month after it was launched in January 2011. Another batch of 55,000 copies was made available shortly after.

After the 2011 general elections in which the Workers&#x27; Party, a major opposition political party in Singapore, made unprecedented gains by winning a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), Lee announced that he decided to leave the Cabinet for his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and his team to have a clean slate. Some analysts, such as Citigroup economist Kit Wei Zheng, believed that the senior Lee had contributed to the PAP&#x27;s poor performance. In particular, he stated during campaigning that the voters of Aljunied constituency had &quot;five years to live and repent&quot; if they elected the Workers&#x27; Party, which some viewed as having backfired for the PAP as the opposition went on to win Aljunied.

In a column in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; on 6 November 2011, Lee&#x27;s daughter, Lee Wei Ling, revealed that her father had peripheral neuropathy. In the column, she recounted how she first noticed her father&#x27;s ailments when she accompanied him to meet the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Connecticut in October 2009. Wei Ling, a neurologist, &quot;did a few simple neurological tests and decided the nerves to his legs were not working as they should&quot;. A day later, when interviewed at a constituency tree-planting event, Lee stated: &quot;I have no doubt at all that this has not affected my mind, my will nor my resolve&quot; and that &quot;people in wheel chairs can make a contribution. I&#x27;ve still got two legs, I will make a contribution&quot;.

==Illness and death==
On 15 February 2013, Lee was admitted to Singapore General Hospital following a prolonged cardiac dysrhythmia, which was followed by a brief stoppage of blood flow to the brain. For the first time in his career as a Member of Parliament (MP), Lee missed the annual Chinese New Year dinner at his constituency, where he was supposed to be the guest-of-honour. He was subsequently discharged, but continued to receive anti-coagulant therapy.

The following year, Lee missed his constituency&#x27;s Chinese New Year dinner for the second consecutive time owing to bodily bacterial invasion. In April 2014, a photo depicting a thin and frail Lee was released online, drawing strong reactions from netizens. According to Lee&#x27;s daughter, Lee Wei Ling, Lee had discussed euthanasia which is not a legal option in Singapore.

On 5 February 2015, Lee was hospitalised for pneumonia and was put on a ventilator at the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, although his condition was reported initially as &quot;stable&quot;. A 26 February update stated that he was again being given antibiotics, while being sedated and still under mechanical ventilation. From 17 to 22 March, Lee continued weakening as he developed an infection while on life support, and he was described as &quot;critically ill&quot;.

On 18 March that year, a death hoax website reported false news of Lee&#x27;s death. The suspect is an unidentified minor who created a false webpage that resembled the PMO official website. Several international news organisations reported on Lee&#x27;s death based on this and later retracted their statements.

On 23rd of that same month, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced his father&#x27;s death at the age of 91. Lee had died at 03:18 Singapore Standard Time (UTC+08:00). A week of national mourning took place, during which time Lee was lying in state at Parliament House. As a mark of respect, State flags at all Government buildings were flown at half-mast. During this time, 1.7 million Singaporean residents as well as world leaders paid tribute to him at Parliament house and community tribute sites throughout the country. A state funeral for Lee was held on 29th of that same month and attended by world leaders. Later that day, Lee was cremated in a private ceremony at the Mandai Crematorium.

==Legacy==
As prime minister from 1959 to 1990, Lee presided over many of Singapore&#x27;s advancements. He oversaw Singapore&#x27;s transformation from an island nation with a high illiteracy rate and no natural resources into a developed country with a high-income economy within a single generation, commonly termed (from his autobiography) as &#x27;From the third world to the first world&#x27;. Singapore&#x27;s gross national product per capita (GNP) rose from $1,240 in 1959 to $18,437 in 1990. The unemployment rate in Singapore dropped from 13.5% in 1959 to 1.7% in 1990. External trade increased from $7.3 billion in 1959 to $205 billion in 1990. In other areas, the life expectancy at birth for Singaporeans rose from 65 years in 1960 to 74 years in 1990. The population of Singapore increased from 1.6 million in 1959 to 3 million in 1990. The number of public flats in Singapore rose from 22,975 in 1959 (then under the Singapore Improvement Trust) to 667,575 in 1990. The Singaporean literacy rate increased from 52% in 1957 to 90% in 1990. Telephone lines per 100 Singaporeans increased from 3 in 1960 to 38 in 1990. Visitor arrivals to Singapore rose from 100,000 in 1960 to 5.3 million in 1990.

Notably, these economic accomplishments were achieved in large part due to Lee&#x27;s stewardship of public administration through relevant and targeted public policy; Lee introduced measures to jumpstart manufacturing of finished goods for export (export-oriented industrialisation) and sought to create a conducive business environment in the trading nation to attract foreign direct investment (through the establishment of the Economic Development Board, EDB). Lee also forged a symbiotic and mutually dependent relationship between the People&#x27;s Action Party with the National Trades Union Congress, whereby the governing political party received certain input from the labour grassroots, whilst the national trade union centre is led by prominent PAP party politicians who usually have ministerial portfolios within the Government. The Government&#x27;s tight control over trade union activities and industrial relations, ensured near-total industrial peace, that was assessed to be a prerequisite for rapid economic development.

Lee was a staunch promoter of economic globalisation and a vocal opponent of protectionism. Lee said that Singapore&#x27;s only natural resources are its people and their strong work ethic. In addition, Lee was focused on social policies such as improving and mandating higher public standards for education, sanitation and hygiene, whilst concurrently improving public health by expanding modern health care and greatly increasing the quantity and quality of high-rise affordable housing (through the establishment of the Housing and Development Board, HDB) for working- and middle-class families. Various world leaders had also praised Lee. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once wrote of Lee: &quot;One of the asymmetries of history is the lack of correspondence between the abilities of some leaders and the power of their countries.&quot; Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher praised &quot;his way of penetrating the fog of propaganda and expressing with unique clarity the issues of our time and the way to tackle them&quot;. Former President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev stated in his memoirs that after the independence of Kazakhstan from the Soviet Union in 1991, he met Lee and stated Lee&#x27;s &quot;observations and advice became for us [Kazakhstan] guidelines in the development of long-term state strategies.&quot;

Lee&#x27;s achievements in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods. He has also had a major influence on thinking in Russia in recent years. On the other hand, proponents of liberal democracy especially in the West criticised Lee&#x27;s rule as authoritarian and as intolerant of dissent, citing his numerous attempts to sue political opponents and newspapers who express unfavourable opinions of Lee. Reporters Without Borders, an international media advocacy group, requested Lee and other senior Singaporean officials to stop taking libel suits against journalists. Lee was a co-inventor of &quot;Asian values&quot;.

Lee was criticised for curtailing press freedoms, often imposing limits on public protests which prevented further occurrences, restricting labour movements from industrial action or strike action, suppressing wage growth of skilled workers (in order to be competitive with developing countries) amid widening and high levels of income inequality along with wealth inequality (relative to other developed countries), had encouraged an elitist mindset as well as filing defamation lawsuits against prominent political opponents. However, supporters argued in retrospect that his actions were necessary for the country&#x27;s early development, and various international political analysts note that Lee&#x27;s governance was generally pragmatic and benevolent. During the three decades in which Lee held office, Singapore grew from a developing country to one of the most developed nations in Asia and the world. Singapore was described as becoming an illiberal democracy under his rule.

==Legal suits==
===Action against &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;===
In April 1977, just months after a general election which saw the People&#x27;s Action Party winning all 69 seats, the Internal Security Department, under orders from Lee, detained Ho Kwon Ping, the Singapore correspondent of the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;, as well as his predecessor Arun Senkuttavan, over their reporting. Ho was detained under the Internal Security Act which allows for indefinite trial, held in solitary confinement for two months, and charged with endangering national security. Following a televised confession in which Ho confessed to &quot;pro-communist activities&quot;, he was fined $3,000. Lee Kuan Yew later charged &quot;FEER&quot; editor, Derek Davies, of participating in &quot;a diabolical international Communist plot&quot; to poison relations between Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia.

In 1987 Lee restricted sale of the &quot;Review&quot; in Singapore after it published an article about the detention of Roman Catholic church workers, reducing circulation of the magazine from 9,000 to 500 copies, on the grounds that it was &quot;interfering in the domestic politics of Singapore.&quot;

On 24 September 2008 the High Court of Singapore, in a summary judgment by Justice Woo Bih Li, ruled that the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; magazine (Hugo Restall, editor), defamed Lee and his son, the Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong. The court found the 2006 article &quot;Singapore&#x27;s &#x27;Martyr&#x27;: Chee Soon Juan&quot; suggested that Lee &quot;ha[d] been running and continue[d] to run Singapore in the same corrupt manner as Durai operated [the National Kidney Foundation] and he ha[d] been using libel actions to suppress those who would question [him] to avoid exposure of his corruption&quot;. The court ordered the Review, owned by Dow Jones &amp; Company (in turn owned by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp), to pay damages to the complainants. The magazine appealed but lost.

===Action against J.B. Jeyaretnam===
Lee commenced proceedings for slander against opposition leader J. B. Jeyaretnam for comments he made at a Workers&#x27; Party rally in the 1988 general election. Lee alleged that Jeyaretnam&#x27;s speech at the rally implied he had tried to cover up the corruption of the former Minister for National Development, Teh Cheang Wan, by aiding and abetting his suicide. The action was heard by Justice Lai Kew Chai, who ruled against Jeyaretnam and ordered him to pay damages of S$260,000 plus costs to Lee. Jeyaretnam lost an appeal against the judgment.

===Action against Devan Nair===
In 1999, the former President of the Republic of Singapore Devan Nair who was living in Canada, remarked in an interview with the Toronto &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that Lee&#x27;s technique of suing his opponents into bankruptcy or oblivion was an abrogation of political rights. Devan Nair also described Lee as &quot;an increasingly self-righteous know-all&quot; surrounded by &quot;department store dummies&quot;. In response to these remarks, Lee sued Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair&#x27;s counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair&#x27;s counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the Singapore government. However, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice refused to throw out Nair&#x27;s counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair had a reasonable cause of action.

Lee wrote in one of his memoirs that Nair was forced to resign as president due to his alleged alcoholism, a charge which Nair denied.

===&quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; defamation case===
In 2010 Lee, together with his son Lee Hsien Loong, and Goh Chok Tong, threatened legal action against The New York Times Company, which owns the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, regarding an op-ed piece titled &quot;All in the Family&quot; of 15 February 2010 by Philip Bowring, a freelance columnist and former editor of the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;. The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; apologised in March that readers of the article may &quot;infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit&quot;. The New York Times Company and Bowring also agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee Hsien Loong, S$50,000 to Lee and S$50,000 to Goh (totalling about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to &quot;dynastic politics&quot; in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew. In response, media-rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders wrote an open letter to urge Lee and other top officials of the Singapore government to stop taking &quot;libel actions&quot; against journalists.

==Political positions==

===Criticism of Chinese marginalisation===
On 15 September 2006, at the Raffles Forum hosted by the School of Public Policy, Lee made a remark as to how the &quot;Malaysian and Indonesian governments systematically marginalise its Chinese people&quot;, by bringing up topics such as the May 1998 riots of Indonesia and &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot;, which subsequently caused a short diplomatic spat. He then described the systematic marginalisation of the Chinese in Malaysia, which aroused a strong response from the Malaysian government. Politicians in Malaysia and Indonesia expressed dissatisfaction with this and demanded the Singaporean government explain and apologise for Lee&#x27;s remarks.

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticised Lee Kuan Yew for his &quot;arrogance and disrespect&quot; for neighbouring countries and countered that Malaysia could also question Singapore&#x27;s marginalisation of its local Malays and other minorities such as the Eurasians and Indians. Former Indonesian President B. J. Habibie also described the &quot;little red dot&quot; term in reference to Singapore as an incentive for Indonesian youth to learn from Singapore&#x27;s achievements, and that the original intention was distorted. On 30 September, while Lee Kuan Yew apologised to the Malaysian Prime Minister at the time Abdullah Badawi for his remarks, he did not fully retract his remarks.

===Eugenics===
Alarmed that Singapore&#x27;s fertility rate was falling precipitously low, Lee launched the Graduate Mothers&#x27; Scheme in 1983, giving tax deductions for children to women with university degrees, and priority in admission to primary schools to graduate mothers with three or more children.

In his speech at the 1983 National Day Rally, Lee said, &quot;If you don&#x27;t include your women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid society... So what happens? There will be less bright people to support dumb people in the next generation. That&#x27;s a problem.&quot;

&quot;If we continue to respond ourselves in this lopsided manner we will be unable to maintain our present standards,&quot; he added. &quot;Levels of competence will decline. Our economy will falter, the administration will suffer, and society will decline [...], for every two college graduates in 25 years&#x27; time there will be one graduate and for every two uneducated workers there will be three.&quot;

In June 1984, Lee&#x27;s government rolled out grants for low-income and low-education women to undergo sterilisation. If a woman and her husband had no O-level passes and fewer than three children, the woman could receive a $10,000 grant for undergoing sterilisation. Sterilised lower-class parents were also given priority primary school admission for their existing first and second children. The uproar over the proposal led to a swing of 12.9 per cent against the People&#x27;s Action Party in the general election held later that year. In 1985, especially controversial portions of the policy that gave education and housing priorities to educated women were eventually abandoned or modified.

A proponent of nature over nurture, Lee averred that &quot;intelligence is 80% nature and 20% nurture&quot; and attributed the successes of his children to genetics.

===Islam===
In 1999, in a discussion forum, Lee Kuan Yew was asked whether the emotional bonds of various ethnic groups in Singapore could be a hurdle to nation building, Lee replied: &quot;Yes, I think so, over a long period of time, and selectively. We must not make an error. If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who&#x27;s very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that&#x27;s a very tricky business. We&#x27;ve got to know his background. I&#x27;m saying these things because they are real, and if I don&#x27;t think that, and I think even if today the Prime Minister doesn&#x27;t think carefully about this, we could have a tragedy. So, these are problems which, as poly students, you&#x27;re colour-blind to, but when you face life in reality, it&#x27;s a different proposition&quot;.

In 2011, leaked diplomatic cables attributed to Lee some controversial comments regarding Islam. The cables quoted Lee as having described Islam as a &quot;venomous religion&quot;. Lee called the remarks &quot;false&quot; and looked up to MFA&#x27;s filenote of meeting and found no record of the claim, stating: &quot;I did talk about extremist terrorists like the Jemaah Islamiyah group, and the jihadist preachers who brainwashed them. They are implacable in wanting to put down all who do not agree with them. So their Islam is a perverted version, which the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Singapore do not subscribe to&quot;. He added that &quot;Singapore Muslim leaders were rational and that the ultimate solution to extremist terrorism was to give moderate Muslims the courage to stand up and speak out against radicals who hijacked Islam to recruit volunteers for their violent ends&quot;.

In &quot;Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going&quot;, Lee stated that Singaporean Muslims faced difficulties in integrating because of their religion and urged them to &quot;be less strict on Islamic observances&quot;. His remarks drew fire from Malay/Muslim leaders and MPs in Singapore, prompting a strong reaction from his son Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister at that time, who said &quot;My views on Muslims&#x27; integration in Singapore differed from the Minister Mentor&#x27;s. Muslims are a valued and respected community, who have done a good deal to strengthen our harmony and social cohesion.&quot; Lee Kuan Yew then told the media &quot;I made this one comment on the Muslims integrating with other communities probably two or three years ago. Ministers and MPs, both Malay and non-Malay, have since told me that Singapore Malays have indeed made special efforts to integrate with the other communities, especially since 9/11, and that my call is out of date.&quot; Subsequently, he added: &quot;I stand corrected. I hope that this trend will continue in the future.&quot;

===Homosexuality===
Section 377A of the Penal Code, which was first introduced in 1938 under British colonial rule that criminalised sex between adult males, remained enforced under Lee&#x27;s premiership. In his later years, Lee appeared to become more supportive of LGBT issues and rights, expressing a belief that homosexuality was genetic and questioning the rationale behind its criminalisation. In 2007, he believed that homosexuality would eventually be accepted in Singapore, but advocated for a measured and &quot;pragmatic approach&quot; toward the matter &quot;to maintain social cohesion.&quot; Section 377A was eventually repealed in 2022.

===Corporal punishment===

One of Lee&#x27;s abiding beliefs was in the efficacy of corporal punishment in the form of caning. In his autobiography &quot;The Singapore Story&quot;, Lee described his time at Raffles Institution in the 1930s, mentioning that he was caned there for chronic lateness by the then headmaster, D. W. McLeod. He wrote: &quot;I bent over a chair and was given three of the best with my trousers on. I did not think he lightened his strokes. I have never understood why Western educationists are so much against corporal punishment. It did my fellow students and me no harm&quot;.

Lee&#x27;s government inherited judicial corporal punishment from British rule, but greatly expanded its scope. Under the British, it had been used as a penalty for offences involving personal violence, amounting to a handful of caning sentences per year. The PAP government under Lee extended its use to an ever-expanding range of crimes. By 1993, it was mandatory for 42 offences and optional for a further 42. Those routinely ordered by the courts to be caned now include drug addicts and illegal immigrants. From 602 canings in 1987, the figure rose to 3,244 in 1993 and to 6,404 in 2007.

In 1994, judicial caning was publicised in the rest of the world when an American teenager, Michael P. Fay, was caned under the vandalism legislation.

School corporal punishment (for male students only) was likewise inherited from the British, and is still in use in schools, permitted under legislation from 1957. Lee also introduced caning in the Singapore Armed Forces, and Singapore is one of the few countries in the world where corporal punishment is an official penalty in military discipline.

=== Press ===
In his interview with Charlie Rose in October 2000, when asked whether he believed in the idea of a free press, LKY responded &quot;I believe in truth&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that the press should be crusading and putting a spin on things&quot; and asserted that newspapers should keep news reporting and editorials separate.

=== Immigration ===
Lee believed that the benefits of immigration had to be carefully balanced against the associated &quot;social load&quot;. In a speech he made in 1971, Lee explained that it was necessary to have non-Singapore workers take up jobs that Singaporeans were not willing to do, but observed that it was important that the number of such migrant workers be carefully controlled because &quot;[t]hey dirty the place... they litter... if you take too many... they will bring us down to their values because it&#x27;s easier to be untidy, scruffy, dirty, anti-social than to be disciplined, well-behaved and a good citizen&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lee and his wife, Kwa Geok Choo, were married on 30 September 1950. Both spoke English as their first language. Lee first started learning Chinese in 1955, at the age of 32. During World War II, he learned the Japanese language to help him survive, and worked as a Japanese translator during the Japanese occupation of Singapore.

Lee and Kwa have two sons and a daughter. His elder son Lee Hsien Loong, was the third prime minister of Singapore. Several members of the Lee family hold prominent positions in the Singapore society. His younger son Lee Hsien Yang was president and CEO of SingTel, and Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). Lee&#x27;s daughter Lee Wei Ling, a neurologist and epileptologist, was director of the National Neuroscience Institute. Lee&#x27;s daughter-in-law Ho Ching, was executive director and CEO of Temasek Holdings. His wife Kwa Geok Choo, died on 2 October 2010, at the age of 89.

Lee had variously described himself as an agnostic and a &quot;nominal Buddhist&quot;. He also mentioned that he was brought up in a family which practiced Chinese ancestor worship but stopped after his father passed away, and that he &quot;neither [denies] nor [accepts] that there is a God&quot;. In his later years, Lee practised meditation under the tutelage of Benedictine monk Laurence Freeman, director of the World Community for Christian Meditation.

Lee was diagnosed with dyslexia in adulthood.

Lee was a founding member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee, which was launched by former French President Jacques Chirac to promote world peace. He was also a member of David Rockefeller&#x27;s &quot;International Council&quot;, which included Henry Kissinger, Riley P. Bechtel, George Shultz and others. Additionally, he was one of the &quot;Forbes&#x27; Brain Trust&quot;, along with Paul Johnson and Ernesto Zedillo.

==Cultural depictions==
In 1979, oil painter Chua Mia Tee depicted Lee&#x27;s return from London after the Merdeka Talks. In 1991, Chua presented an oil painting of Lee to the Minister himself, depicting him against a backdrop of Singapore&#x27;s transformation. In 1992, artist Lai Kui Fang presented historical oil paintings of Lee&#x27;s 1959 swearing-in ceremony as prime minister, which are now part of the National Museum of Singapore&#x27;s collection.

In 2008, artist Ben Puah unveiled &quot;Hero&quot;, a solo exhibition of Lee portraits at Forth Gallery.

In 2009, artist Richard Lim Han presented &quot;Singapore Guidance Angel&quot;, a solo exhibition of Lee portraits at Forth Gallery. In the same year, freelance designer, Christopher &quot;Treewizard&quot; Pereira, began making caricature figurines of Lee which range from 12 cm to 30 cm. Comics artist and painter Sonny Liew depicted Lee as part of the series &quot;Eric Khoo is a Hotel Magnate&quot; at Mulan Gallery. In addition, Cultural Medallion recipient Tan Swie Hian also began a painting of Lee and his late wife titled &quot;A Couple&quot;. The painting, which took Tan five years to complete, was partially damaged by a fire in 2013. It depicts Lee and Kwa in their youth, is based on a 1946 black-and-white photograph of the couple in Cambridge University and incorporates in its background Tan&#x27;s poem in memory of Kwa. &quot;A Couple&quot; was purchased by art collector Wu Hsioh Kwang.

In 2010, Valentine Willie Fine Art gallery asked 19 local artists to imagine a future without Lee. The resulting exhibition, &quot;Beyond LKY&quot;, included artist a triptych of Lee as a father figure looming over a tiny kneeling figure with the words, &quot;Papa can you hear me&quot;; an installation of a broken piano with a tape recorder playing a crackling version of Singapore&#x27;s National Anthem; white ceramic chains hanging on a wall; and an installation of hammers smashed together. That year, Korean artist Kim Dong Yoo depicted Lee in &quot;Lee Kuan Yew &amp; Queen Elizabeth II&quot; (2010), an oil-on-canvas portrait of Lee using small images of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s head, a reference to Singapore being a former British colony and current member of the Commonwealth. Indian-Swiss novelist Meira Chand&#x27;s &quot;A Different Sky&quot;, published by UK&#x27;s Harvill Secker in 2010, features Lee in his early years as a lawyer and co-founder of the People&#x27;s Action Party.

In 2011, the iris image of Lee&#x27;s eye was captured and artistically rendered to resemble a sand art gallery piece. His eye image with his autograph was auctioned off to raise funds for the Singapore Eye Research Institute. In 2012, urban artist Sam Lo depicted Lee in their controversial &quot;Limpeh&quot; series, featuring his image in Shepard Fairey-inspired stickers, mirrors and collages.

In 2013, poet Cyril Wong published &quot;The Dictator&#x27;s Eyebrow&quot;, a poetry collection revolving around a Lee-like figure and his eyebrow&#x27;s thirst for recognition and power. In the same year, a group of Tamil poets from three countries, including Singapore Literature Prize winner Ramanathan Vairavan, produced &quot;Lee Kuan Yew 90&quot;, a collection of 90 new poems celebrating Lee&#x27;s legacy. Artist Sukeshi Sondhi also staged &quot;An Icon &amp; A Legend&quot;, a solo exhibition at featuring 20 pop art style paintings of Lee. Speed painter Brad Blaze was commissioned to craft a portrait of Lee, &quot;Trailblazer: Singapore&quot;, to raise funds for Reach Community Services Society. In August, a bronze bust of Lee, cast by contemporary French artist-sculptor Nacera Kainou, was unveiled at the Singapore University of Technology and Design as an early birthday present to Lee from the Lyon-Singapore Association and the municipality of Lyon.

In 2014, Bruneian painter Huifong Ng landed an exhibition after painting a portrait of Lee. In May of that year, illustrator Patrick Yee produced the children&#x27;s picture book &quot;A Boy Named Harry: The Childhood of Lee Kuan Yew&quot;, published by Epigram Books. The series was later translated into Mandarin. Chinese artist Ren Zhenyu also created expressionist portraits of Lee in electric hues as part of his &quot;Pop and Politics&quot; series. Vietnamese artist Mai Huy Dung has crafted a series of oil painting portraits of Lee. Ukrainian artist Oleg Lazarenko also depicted Lee as part of his painting &quot;Lion of Singapore&quot;. In October 2014, cartoonist Morgan Chua released &quot;LKY: Political Cartoons&quot;, an anthology of cartoons about Lee published by Epigram Books, featuring a 1971 &quot;Singapore Herald&quot; cartoon of Lee on a tank threatening to crush a baby representing press freedoms. The Madame Tussauds Singapore museum also unveiled a wax figure of Lee and his late wife, Madam Kwa Geok Choo seated and smiling together against a backdrop of red flowers formed in the shape of two hearts. The statues were created based on a photograph that was taken by Madam Kwa&#x27;s niece, Ms Kwa Kim Li, of the pair on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2008 at Sentosa. Another wax figure of Lee Kuan Yew resides at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong.

In February 2015, weeks before Lee&#x27;s death, Helmi Yusof of &quot;The Business Times&quot; reported on how &quot;In the last few years, artworks featuring Lee Kuan Yew have turned into a flourishing cottage industry&quot;. Artworks included Jeffrey Koh&#x27;s seven LKY Pez candy-dispenser sculptures, paintings of Lee in the manner of Van Gogh, and Korean sculptor Park Seung Mo&#x27;s three-dimensional image of Lee made using stainless steel wires. In the same month, illustrator Patrick Yee launched the second title in his picture book series about Lee, called &quot;Harry Grows Up: The Early Years of Lee Kuan Yew&quot;, at an exhibition at the National Library, Singapore. On 24 March 2015, the National Parks Board named a Singapore Botanic Gardens orchid hybrid called the &quot;Aranda Lee Kuan Yew&quot; in honour of Lee&#x27;s efforts work in conservation and environmentalism. In March 2015, a portrait of Lee by Ong Yi Teck, comprising Lee&#x27;s name written about 18,000 times, went viral on social media. The portrait was made in tribute to Lee, who was then critically ill.

Days after Lee died in 2015, 16-year-old blogger Amos Yee released a video, &quot;Lee Kuan Yew is Finally Dead!&quot;, which criticised Lee and negatively compared him to Jesus Christ. Yee also posted on his blog a stick-figure cartoon depicting Lee having sex with Margaret Thatcher, a personal and political ally of Lee&#x27;s. For his actions, Yee was charged with insulting religious feelings and obscenity, and sentenced to four weeks imprisonment despite his youth. In April 2015, an exhibition of 300 oil paintings on Lee and Singapore opened at Suntec City. Presented by art collector Vincent Chua, &quot;The Singapore Story&quot; featured 80 portraits of Lee and a life-size statue of Lee shaking hands with Deng Xiaoping when the Chinese statesman visited Singapore in 1978.

In July 2015, veteran actor Lim Kay Tong portrayed Lee in the historical film &quot;1965&quot;, including a re-enactment of the iconic press conference when Lee announced that Singapore would be separated from Malaysia That same month, actor Adrian Pang played Lee in &quot;The LKY Musical&quot; opposite Sharon Au&#x27;s Kwa Geok Choo. In October 2015, sculptor Lim Leong Seng exhibited a 75 cm bronze sculpture he made of Lee, entitled &quot;Weathering Storms As One&quot;. In November 2015, the Singaporean Honorary Consulate General in Barcelona unveiled a bust of Lee at Cap Roig Gardens in Costa Brava. In 2015, the Asian edition of &quot;Time&quot; featured the late Lee Kuan Yew on its cover. Lee is also central to the 2015 graphic novel &quot;The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye&quot;.

<doc id="65071" wikidata="Q276453" url="?curid=65071" title="Monster">
<text>A monster is a type of imaginary creature found in fiction, folklore, mythology and religion. They are very often depicted as dangerous and aggressive, with a strange or grotesque appearance that causes terror and fear, often in humans. Monsters usually resemble , deformed, otherworldly and/or mutated animals or entirely unique creatures of varying sizes, but may also take a human form, such as mutants, ghosts, spirits, zombies, or cannibals, among other things. They may or may not have supernatural powers, but are usually capable of killing or causing some form of destruction, threatening the social or moral order of the human world in the process.

Animal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice to Poseidon the white bull which the god sent him, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos&#x27; wife, Pasiphaë, fall in love with the bull. She copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull&#x27;s head, the Minotaur). Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human (Medusa and her Gorgon sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity (werewolves, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society.

Monsters may also be depicted as misunderstood and friendly creatures who frighten individuals away without wanting to, or may be so large, strong and clumsy that they cause unintentional damage or death. Some monsters in fiction are depicted as mischievous and boisterous but not necessarily threatening (such as a sly goblin), while others may be docile but prone to becoming angry or hungry, thus needing to be tamed and taught to resist savage urges, or killed if they cannot be handled or controlled successfully.

Monsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society&#x27;s ideas of monsters is known as &quot;monstrophy&quot;. Monsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. Well-known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, werewolves, vampires, demons, mummies, and zombies.

==Etymology==

&quot;Monster&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;monstrum&quot;, itself derived ultimately from the verb &quot;moneo&quot; (&quot;to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell&quot;), and denotes anything &quot;strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature, by which the gods give notice of evil,&quot; &quot;a strange, unnatural, hideous person, animal, or thing,&quot; or any &quot;monstrous or unusual thing, circumstance, or adventure.&quot;

==Cultural heritage==
In the words of Tina Marie Boyer, assistant professor of medieval German literature at Wake Forest University, &quot;monsters do not emerge out of a cultural void; they have a literary and cultural heritage&quot;.

In the religious context of ancient Greeks and Romans, monsters were seen as signs of &quot;divine displeasure&quot;, and it was thought that birth defects were especially ominous, being &quot;an unnatural event&quot; or &quot;a malfunctioning of nature&quot;.

Monsters are not necessarily abominations however. The Roman historian Suetonius, for instance, describes a snake&#x27;s absence of legs or a bird&#x27;s ability to fly as monstrous, as both are &quot;against nature&quot;. Nonetheless, the negative connotations of the word quickly established themselves, and by the playwright and philosopher Seneca&#x27;s time, the word had extended into its philosophical meaning, &quot;a visual and horrific revelation of the truth&quot;.

In spite of this, mythological monsters such as the Hydra and Medusa are not natural beings, but divine entities. This seems to be a holdover from Proto-Indo-European religion and other belief systems, in which the divisions between &quot;spirit,&quot; &quot;monster,&quot; and &quot;god&quot; were less evident.

==Monsters in fiction==

===Prose fiction===
The history of monsters in fiction is long. For instance, Grendel in the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; is an archetypal monster: deformed, brutal, and with enormous strength, he raids a human settlement nightly to slay and feed on his victims. The modern literary monster has its roots in examples such as the monster in Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and the vampire in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;.

Monsters are a staple of fantasy fiction, horror fiction, and science fiction (where the monsters are often extraterrestrial in nature). There also exists monster erotica, a subgenre of erotic fiction that involves monsters.

===Film===
====Pre–World War II monster films====

During the age of silent films, monsters tended to be human-sized, e.g. Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, the Golem, werewolves and vampires. The film &quot;Siegfried&quot; featured a dragon that consisted of stop-motion animated models, as in RKO&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot;, the first giant monster film of the sound era.

Universal Studios specialized in monsters, with Bela Lugosi&#x27;s reprisal of his stage role, Dracula, and Boris Karloff playing Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. The studio also made several lesser films, such as &quot;Man-Made Monster&quot;, starring Lon Chaney Jr. as a carnival side-show worker who is turned into an electrically charged killer, able to dispatch victims merely by touching them, causing death by electrocution.

There was also a variant of Dr. Frankenstein, the mad surgeon Dr. Gogol (played by Peter Lorre), who transplanted hands that were reanimated with malevolent temperaments, in the film &quot;Mad Love&quot;.

Werewolves were introduced in films during this period, and similar creatures were presented in &quot;Cat People&quot;. Mummies were cinematically depicted as fearsome monsters as well. As for giant creatures, the cliffhanger of the first episode of the 1936 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serial did not use a costumed actor, instead using real-life lizards to depict a pair of battling dragons via use of camera perspective. However, the cliffhanger of the ninth episode of the same serial had a man in a rubber suit play the Fire Dragon, which picks up a doll representing Flash in its claws. The cinematic monster cycle eventually wore thin, having a comedic turn in &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948).

====Post–World War II monster films====

In the post–World War II era, however, giant monsters returned to the screen with a vigor that has been causally linked to the development of nuclear weapons. One early example occurred in the American film &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;, which was about a dinosaur that attacked a lighthouse. Subsequently, there were Japanese film depictions, (Godzilla, Gamera), British depictions (&quot;Gorgo&quot;), and even Danish depictions (&quot;Reptilicus&quot;), of giant monsters attacking cities. A recent depiction of a giant monster is depicted in J. J. Abrams&#x27;s &quot;Cloverfield&quot;, which was released in theaters 18 January 2008. The intriguing proximity of other planets brought the notion of extraterrestrial monsters to the big screen, some of which were huge in size (such as King Ghidorah and Gigan), while others were of a more human scale. During this period, the fish-human monster Gill-man was developed in the film series &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;.
Britain&#x27;s Hammer Film Productions brought color to the monster movies in the late 1950s. Around this time, the earlier Universal films were usually shown on American television by independent stations (rather than network stations) by using announcers with strange personas, who gained legions of young fans. Although they have since changed considerably, movie monsters did not entirely disappear from the big screen as they did in the late 1940s.

Occasionally, monsters are depicted as friendly or misunderstood creatures. King Kong and Frankenstein&#x27;s monster are two examples of misunderstood creatures. Frankenstein&#x27;s monster is frequently depicted in this manner, in series and films such as &quot;Monster Squad&quot; and &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. The Hulk is an example of the &quot;Monster as Hero&quot; archetype. The theme of the &quot;Friendly Monster&quot; is pervasive in pop-culture. Chewbacca, Elmo, and Shrek are notable examples of friendly &quot;monsters&quot;. In the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; franchise by Pixar, the monster characters scare (and later entertain) children in order to create energy for running machinery in their home world, while the furry monsters of &quot;The Muppets&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot; live in harmony with animals and humans alike. Japanese culture also commonly features monsters which are benevolent or likable, with the most famous examples being the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise and the pioneering anime &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;. The book series/webisodes/toy line of Monster High is another example.
===Games===
Monsters are commonly encountered in fantasy or role-playing games, as well as video games, as enemies for players to fight against. They may include aliens, legendary creatures, extra-dimensional entities or mutated versions of regular animals.

Especially in role-playing games, &quot;monster&quot; is a catch-all term for hostile characters that are fought by the player. Sentient fictional races are usually not referred to as monsters. At other times, the term can carry a neutral connotation, such as in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, where it is used to refer to cute fictional creatures that resemble real-world animals. Characters in games may refer to all of such creatures as &quot;monsters&quot;. Another role playing game that has many different fantasy creatures (monsters and dragons alike), is &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

In some other games, such as &quot;Undertale&quot; and &quot;Deltarune&quot;, &quot;Monsters&quot; (which are usually NPCs) refer to strange beings that are either undead, robots, humanoids or mythical creatures that share similarities with human beings.

<doc id="65085" wikidata="Q380329" url="?curid=65085" title="Triticale">
<text>Triticale (; × &quot;Triticosecale&quot;) is a hybrid of wheat (&quot;Triticum&quot;) and rye (&quot;Secale&quot;) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Germany. Commercially available triticale is almost always a second-generation hybrid, i.e., a cross between two kinds of primary (first-cross) triticales. As a rule, triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance (including soil conditions) of rye. Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop. Depending on the cultivar, triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents. It is grown mostly for forage or fodder, although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores and can be found in some breakfast cereals.

When crossing wheat and rye, wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent (pollen donor). The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself.

The primary producers of triticale are Poland, Germany, Belarus, France and Russia. In 2014, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 17.1 million tons were harvested in 37 countries across the world.

The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid, which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species. In other words, triticale is an allotetraploid. In earlier years, most work was done on octoploid triticale. Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time. The tetraploids showed little promise, but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application.

The CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) triticale improvement program was intended to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries. Triticale was thought to have potential in the production of bread and other food products, such as cookies, pasta, pizza dough and breakfast cereals. The protein content is higher than that of wheat, although the glutenin fraction is less. The grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat. Acceptance would require the milling industry to adapt to triticale, as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to triticale. Past research indicated that triticale could be used as a feed grain and, particularly, later research found that its starch is readily digested. As a feed grain, triticale is already well established and of high economic importance. It has received attention as a potential energy crop, and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crop&#x27;s biomass in bioethanol production. Triticale has also been used to produce vodka.

== History ==

In the 19th century, crossing cultivars or species became better understood, allowing the controlled hybridization of more plants and animals. In 1873, Alexander Wilson first managed to manually fertilize the female organs of wheat flowers with rye pollen (male gametes), but found that the resulting plants were sterile, much the way the offspring of a horse and donkey is an infertile mule. Fifteen years later in 1888, a partially-fertile hybrid was produced by , &quot;Tritosecale Rimpaui Wittmack&quot;. Such hybrids germinate only when the chromosomes spontaneously double.

Unfortunately, &quot;partially fertile&quot; was all that was produced until 1937. In that year, it was discovered that the chemical colchicine, which is used both for general plant germination and as a treatment for gout, would force chromosome doubling by keeping them from pulling apart during cell division. Triticale had become viable, though at that point the cost of producing the seeds was disproportionate to the yield.

By the 1960s, triticale was being produced that was far more nutritious than normal wheat. However, it was a poorly-producing crop, sometimes yielding shriveled kernels, germinating poorly or prematurely, and did not bake well.

Modern triticale has overcome most of these problems, after decades of additional breeding and gene transfer with wheat and rye. Millions of acres/hectares of the crop are grown around the world, slowly increasing toward becoming a significant source of food-calories.

== Species ==

Triticale hybrids are currently classified by ploidy into three nothospecies:
* × &quot;Triticosecale semisecale&quot; – tetraploid triticale. Unstable, but used in breeding bridging. Includes the following crosses:
** &quot;Triticum monococcum&quot; × &quot;Secale cereale&quot;, genome AARR;
** Alternative crosses, genome ABRR (mixogenome A/B).
* × &quot;Triticosecale neoblaringhemii&quot; – hexaploid triticale. Stable, currently very successful in agriculture. May be produced by &quot;Secale cereale&quot; × &quot;Triticum turgidum&quot;, genome AABBRR.
* × &quot;Triticosecale rimpaui&quot; – octaploid triticale. Not completely stable, mainly historical importance. May be produced by &quot;Secale cereale&quot; × &quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;, genome AABBDDRR.

The current treatment follows the Mac Key 2005 treatment of &quot;Triticum&quot; using a broad species concept based on genome composition. Traditional classifications used a narrow species concept based on the treatment of wheats by Dorofeev &quot;et al.&quot;, 1979, and hence produced many more species names. The genome notation follows , with the rye genome notated as R.

== Biology and genetics ==

Earlier work with wheat-rye crosses was difficult due to low survival of the resulting hybrid embryo and spontaneous chromosome doubling. These two factors were difficult to predict and control. To improve the viability of the embryo and thus avoid its abortion, &quot;in vitro&quot; culture techniques were developed (Laibach, 1925). Colchicine was used as a chemical agent to double the chromosomes. After these developments, a new era of triticale breeding was introduced. Earlier triticale hybrids had four reproductive disorders, namely meiotic instability, high aneuploid frequency, low fertility and shriveled seed (Muntzing 1939; Krolow 1966). Cytogenetical studies were encouraged and well funded to overcome these problems.

It is especially difficult to see the expression of rye genes in the background of wheat cytoplasm and the predominant wheat nuclear genome. This makes it difficult to realise the potential of rye in disease resistance and ecological adaptation.

Triticale is essentially a self-fertilizing, or naturally inbred crop. This mode of reproduction results in a more homozygous genome. The crop is, however, adapted to this form of reproduction from an evolutionary point of view. Cross-fertilization is also possible, but it is not the primary form of reproduction.

&quot;&quot; is a stem rust resistance gene which is commonly found in triticale. Originally from rye (Imperial rye), now () widely found in triticale. Located on the 3A chromosome arm, originally from 3R. Virulence has been observed in field by &quot;Puccinia graminis&quot; f. sp. &quot;secalis&quot; (&quot;Pgs&quot;) and in an artificial cross &quot;Pgs&quot; &quot;Puccinia graminis&quot; f. sp. &quot;tritici&quot; (&quot;Pgt&quot;). When successful, &quot;Sr27&quot; is among the few &quot;Sr&quot;s that does not even allow the underdeveloped uredinia and slight degree of sporulation commonly allowed by most &quot;Sr&quot;s. Instead there are necrotic or chlorotic flecks. Deployment in triticale in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, however, rapidly showed virulence between 1982 and 1984 – the first virulence on this gene in the world. (This was especially associated with the cultivar Coorong.) Therefore, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center&#x27;s triticale offerings were tested and many were found to depend solely on &quot;Sr27&quot;. Four years later, in 1988 virulence was found in South Africa. &quot;Sr27&quot; has become less common in CIMMYT triticales since the mid-&#x27;80s.

== Conventional breeding approaches ==

The aim of a triticale breeding programme is mainly focused on the improvement of quantitative traits, such as grain yield, nutritional quality and plant height, as well as traits which are more difficult to improve, such as earlier maturity and improved test weight (a measure of bulk density). These traits are controlled by more than one gene. Problems arise, however, because such polygenic traits involve the integration of several physiological processes in their expression. Thus the lack of single-gene control (or simple inheritance) results in low trait heritability (Zumelzú &quot;et al.&quot; 1998).

Since the induction of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale breeding programme in 1964, the improvement in realised grain yield has been remarkable. In 1968, at Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, in northwest Mexico, the highest yielding triticale line produced 2.4 t/ha. Today, CIMMYT has released high yielding spring triticale lines (e.g. Pollmer-2) which have surpassed the 10 t/ha yield barrier under optimum production conditions.

Based on the commercial success of other hybrid crops, the use of hybrid triticales as a strategy for enhancing yield in favourable, as well as marginal, environments has proven successful over time. Earlier research conducted by CIMMYT made use of a chemical hybridising agent to evaluate heterosis in hexaploid triticale hybrids. To select the most promising parents for hybrid production, test crosses conducted in various environments are required, because the variance of their specific combining ability under differing environmental conditions is the most important component in evaluating their potential as parents to produce promising hybrids. The prediction of general combining ability of any triticale plant from the performance of its parents is only moderate with respect to grain yield. Commercially exploitable yield advantages of hybrid triticale cultivars is dependent on improving parent heterosis and on advances in inbred-line development.

Triticale is useful as an animal feed grain. However, it is necessary to improve its milling and bread-making quality aspects to increase its potential for human consumption. The relationship between the constituent wheat and rye genomes were noted to produce meiotic irregularities, and genome instability and incompatibility presented numerous problems when attempts were made to improve triticale. This led to two alternative methods to study and improve its reproductive performance, namely, the improvement of the number of grains per floral spikelet and its meiotic behaviour. The number of grains per spikelet has an associated low heritability value (de Zumelzú et al. 1998). In improving yield, indirect selection (the selection of correlated/related traits other than that to be improved) is not necessarily as effective as direct selection. (Gallais 1984)

Lodging (the toppling over of the plant stem, especially under windy conditions) resistance is a polygenically inherited (expression is controlled by many genes) trait, and has thus been an important breeding aim in the past. The use of dwarfing genes, known as &quot;Rht&quot; genes, which have been incorporated from both &quot;Triticum&quot; and &quot;Secale&quot;, has resulted in a decrease of up to in plant height without causing any adverse effects.

A 2013 study found that hybrids have better yield stability under yield stress than do inbred lines.

==Application of newer techniques==
Abundant information exists concerning R-genes (for disease resistance) in wheat, and a continuously updated on-line catalogue, the Catalogue of Gene Symbols, of these genes can be found at . Another online database of cereal rust resistance genes is available at . Unfortunately, less is known about rye and particularly triticale R-genes. Many R-genes have been transferred to wheat from its wild relatives, and appear in such papers and catalogues, thus making them available for triticale breeding. The two mentioned databases are significant contributors to improving the genetic variability of the triticale gene pool through gene (or more specifically, allele) provision. Genetic variability is essential for progress in breeding. In addition, genetic variability can also be achieved by producing new primary triticales, which essentially means the reconstitution of triticale, and the development of various hybrids involving triticale, such as triticale-rye hybrids. In this way, some chromosomes from the R genome have been replaced by some from the D genome. The resulting so-called substitution and translocation triticale facilitates the transfer of R-genes.

===Introgression===
Introgression involves the crossing of closely related plant relatives, and results in the transfer of &#x27;blocks&#x27; of genes, i.e. larger segments of chromosomes compared to single genes. R-genes are generally introduced within such blocks, which are usually incorporated/translocated/introgressed into the distal (extreme) regions of chromosomes of the crop being introgressed. Genes located in the proximal areas of chromosomes may be completely linked (very closely spaced), thus preventing or severely hampering recombination, which is necessary to incorporate such blocks. Molecular markers (small lengths of DNA of a characterized/known sequence) are used to &#x27;tag&#x27; and thus track such translocations. A weak colchicine solution has been employed to increase the probability of recombination in the proximal chromosome regions, and thus the introduction of the translocation to that region. The resultant translocation of smaller blocks that indeed carry the R-gene(s) of interest has decreased the probability of introducing unwanted genes.

The &quot;&quot; resistance gene was introgressed into wheat from the 2R chromosome of rye. However this was actually done &quot;through&quot; triticale. Triticale has been the amphiploid for several such rye⇨wheat introgressions.

A 2014 study found that &quot;&quot; dwarfing gene from the rye 5R chromosome also provides Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in this host.

===Production of doubled haploids===

Doubled haploid (DH) plants have the potential to save much time in the development of inbred lines. This is achieved in a single generation, as opposed to many, which would otherwise occupy much physical space/facilities. DHs also express deleterious recessive alleles otherwise masked by dominance effects in a genome containing more than one copy of each chromosome (and thus more than one copy of each gene). Various techniques exist to create DHs. The &quot;in vitro&quot; culture of anthers and microspores is most often used in cereals, including triticale. These two techniques are referred to as androgenesis, which refers to the development of pollen. Many plant species and cultivars within species, including triticale, are recalcitrant in that the success rate of achieving whole newly generated (diploid) plants is very low. Genotype by culture medium interaction is responsible for varying success rates, as is a high degree of microspore abortion during culturing. The response of parental triticale lines to anther culture is known to be correlated to the response of their progeny. Chromosome elimination is another method of producing DHs, and involves hybridisation of wheat with maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot; L.), followed by auxin treatment and the artificial rescue of the resultant haploid embryos before they naturally abort. This technique is applied rather extensively to wheat. Its success is in large part due to the insensitivity of maize pollen to the crossability inhibitor genes known as Kr1 and Kr2 that are expressed in the floral style of many wheat cultivars. The technique is unfortunately less successful in triticale. However, &quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot; (a grass) was found to be just as effective as maize with respect to the production of DHs in both wheat and triticale.

===Application of molecular markers===
An important advantage of biotechnology applied to plant breeding is the speeding up of cultivar release that would otherwise take 8–12 years. It is the process of selection that is actually enhanced, i.e., retaining that which is desirable or promising and ridding that which is not. This carries with it the aim of changing the genetic structure of the plant population. The website is a valuable resource for marker assisted selection (MAS) protocols relating to R-genes in wheat. MAS is a form of indirect selection. The Catalogue of Gene Symbols mentioned earlier is an additional source of molecular and morphological markers. Again, triticale has not been well characterised with respect to molecular markers, although an abundance of rye molecular markers makes it possible to track rye chromosomes and segments thereof within a triticale background.

Yield improvements of up to 20% have been achieved in hybrid triticale cultivars due to heterosis. This raises the question of what inbred lines should be crossed (to produce hybrids) with each other as parents to maximize yield in their hybrid progeny. This is termed the &#x27;combining ability&#x27; of the parental lines. The identification of good combining ability at an early stage in the breeding programme can reduce the costs associated with &#x27;carrying&#x27; a large number of plants (literally thousands) through it, and thus forms part of efficient selection. Combining ability is assessed by taking into consideration all available information on descent (genetic relatedness), morphology, qualitative (simply inherited) traits and biochemical and molecular markers. Exceptionally little information exists on the use of molecular markers to predict heterosis in triticale. Molecular markers are generally accepted as better predictors than morphological markers (of agronomic traits) due to their insensitivity to variation in environmental conditions.

A useful molecular marker known as a simple sequence repeat (SSR) is used in breeding with respect to selection. SSRs are segments of a genome composed of tandem repeats of a short sequence of nucleotides, usually two to six base pairs. They are popular tools in genetics and breeding because of their relative abundance compared to other marker types, a high degree of polymorphism (number of variants), and easy assaying by polymerase chain reaction. However, they are expensive to identify and develop. Comparative genome mapping has revealed a high degree of similarity in terms of sequence colinearity between closely related crop species. This allows the exchange of such markers within a group of related species, such as wheat, rye and triticale. One study established a 58% and 39% transferability rate to triticale from wheat and rye, respectively. Transferability refers to the phenomenon where the sequence of DNA nucleotides flanking the SSR locus (position on the chromosome) is sufficiently homologous (similar) between genomes of closely related species. Thus, DNA primers (generally, a short sequence of nucleotides used to direct the copying reaction during PCR) designed for one species can be used to detect SSRs in related species. SSR markers are available in wheat and rye, but very few, if any, are available for triticale.

===Genetic transformation===
The genetic transformation of crops involves the incorporation of &#x27;foreign&#x27; genes or, rather, very small DNA fragments compared to introgression discussed earlier. Amongst other uses, transformation is a useful tool to introduce new traits or characteristics into the transformed crop. Two methods are commonly employed: infectious bacterial-mediated (usually &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;) transfer and biolistics, with the latter being most commonly applied to allopolyploid cereals such as triticale. &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-mediated transformation, however, holds several advantages, such as a low level of DNA rearrangement in the transgenic plant, a low number of introduced copies of the transforming DNA, stable integration of an a-priori characterized T-DNA fragment (containing the DNA expressing the trait of interest) and an expected higher level of transgene expression. Triticale has, until recently, only been transformed via biolistics, with a 3.3% success rate. Little has been documented on &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-mediated transformation of wheat: while no data existed with respect to triticale until 2005, the success rate in later work was nevertheless low.

==Research==

Triticale holds much promise as a commercial crop, as it has the potential to address specific problems within the cereal industry. Research is currently being conducted worldwide in places like Stellenbosch University in South Africa.

Conventional plant breeding has helped establish triticale as a valuable crop, especially where conditions are less favourable for wheat cultivation. Triticale being a synthesized grain notwithstanding, many initial limitations, such as an inability to reproduce due to infertility and seed shrivelling, low yield and poor nutritional value, have been largely eliminated.

Tissue culture techniques with respect to wheat and triticale have seen continuous improvements, but the isolation and culturing of individual microspores seems to hold the most promise. Many molecular markers can be applied to marker-assisted gene transfer, but the expression of R-genes in the new genetic background of triticale remains to be investigated. More than 750 wheat microsatellite primer pairs are available in public wheat breeding programmes, and could be exploited in the development of SSRs in triticale. Another type of molecular marker, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), is likely to have a significant impact on the future of triticale breeding.

==Health concerns==

Like both its hybrid parents – wheat and rye – triticale contains gluten and is therefore unsuitable for people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy, among others.

==In fiction==
An episode of the popular TV series &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, revolved around the protection of a grain developed from triticale. This grain was named &quot;quadro-triticale&quot; by writer David Gerrold at the suggestion of producer Gene Coon, with four distinct lobes per kernel. In that episode Mr. Spock correctly attributes the ancestry of the nonfictional grain to 20th-century Canada.

Indeed, in 1953 the University of Manitoba began the first North American triticale breeding program. Early breeding efforts concentrated on developing a high-yield, drought-tolerant human food crop species suitable for marginal wheat-producing areas. (Later in the episode, Chekov claims that the fictional quadro-triticale was a &quot;Russian invention&quot;.)

A later episode titled &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot;, in the animated series, also written by Gerrold, dealt with &quot;quinto-triticale&quot;, an improvement on the original, having apparently five lobes per kernel.

Three decades later the spinoff series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; revisited quadro-triticale and the depredations of the Tribbles in the episode &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;.

He is most widely known for his 1978 book &quot;Faeries&quot; with Alan Lee, and as the conceptual designer of the Jim Henson films &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982) and &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986). According to &quot;Wired&quot;, Froud is &quot;one of the most pre-emiminent visualizers of the world of faerie and folktale&quot;.

Most recently, Froud developed the 2019 streaming television series &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;.

== Early life ==
Froud was born in Winchester, England in 1947. An only child, he grew up in rural Hampshire before moving to Kent. In 1967 he enrolled as a painter at Maidstone College of Art, where he graduated with a first class honors diploma in Graphic Design in 1971.

==Career==
After graduating, Froud spent five years working as a commercial illustrator in Soho, London before moving to Chagford, Devon in 1975. Between 1972 and 1976, he illustrated four books by children&#x27;s author Margaret Mahy and &quot;Are All the Giants Dead?&quot; by Mary Norton. In 1976, Froud was featured in &quot;Once Upon a Time: Some Contemporary Illustrators of Fantasy&quot;, a survey of modern British illustrators. In 1977, an anthology of his artwork, &quot;The Land of Froud&quot;, was published.

In collaboration with his friend and fellow artist Alan Lee, Froud created the 1978 book &quot;Faeries&quot;, an illustrated compendium of faerie folklore. &quot;Faeries&quot; reached number four on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Sellers list, and by 2003 had sold over five million copies.

Froud&#x27;s artwork in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and &quot;The Land of Froud&quot; brought him to the attention of Jim Henson, who sought out Froud to collaborate on his all-puppetry film &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. Froud served as the conceptual designer of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, released in 1982. The same year, his concept art for the film was published in the companion book &quot;The World of the Dark Crystal&quot;. Froud was also the conceptual designer for Henson&#x27;s next feature film, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, released in 1986, as well as for the pilot episode of Henson&#x27;s television series &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, first aired in 1987. Following his collaborations with Henson, Froud&#x27;s filmography continued; as a designer for the 1989 Japanese animated film &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot;; as a visual consultant on the 2000 American animated film &quot;The Life &amp; Adventures of Santa Claus&quot; and P. J. Hogan’s 2003 live-action film &quot;Peter Pan&quot;; and as a concept artist on the 2016 Disney film &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;. Froud returned to working with the Jim Henson Company as the primary conceptual designer of the 2019 Netflix series &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;, a prequel to &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Froud formed an artistic-literary partnership with Terry Jones, who was a screenwriter on &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. Together they produced &quot;The Goblins of Labyrinth&quot; (1986), a companion book containing Froud&#x27;s concept art for the film, and subsequently a number of non-&quot;Labyrinth&quot;-related books about fairies and goblins. Their &quot;Lady Cottington&quot; series parodied the Cottingley Fairies phenomenon. For his artwork in the first book of the series, &quot;Lady Cottington&#x27;s Pressed Fairy Book&quot; (1994), Froud won the Hugo Award for Best Original Artwork and the Chesley Award for Best Interior Illustration.

In 1991, Froud created over 50 paintings and drawings for his &quot;Faerielands&quot; series, a collaborative project in which he invited four fantasy authors — Charles de Lint, Patricia A. McKillip, Terri Windling and Midori Snyder — to choose their favourite of his pieces and write stories to go with them, based on the premise that &quot;Faerie, inextricably bound as it is to nature and natural forces, is gravely threatened by the ecological crises that human beings have brought to our world”. The resulting novels were to be published by Bantam Books. However, only de Lint&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Wood&quot; and McKillip&#x27;s &quot;Something Rich and Strange&quot; were published in 1994 under the banner &quot;Brian Froud&#x27;s Faerielands&quot; before the project was cancelled.

His artwork has been exhibited in the United Kingdom and the United States. By 2003, Froud had sold over eight million large-format books of his paintings of fairies.

== Personal life ==
Froud is married to Wendy Froud (&quot;née&quot; Midener), a puppet-maker and sculptor whom he met at Jim Henson Studios in 1978 while working on &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. The couple married on 31 May 1980, in Chagford. Their son Toby (born 1984) portrayed the infant of the same name in &quot;Labyrinth&quot; at the age of one, and later became a puppeteer and creature fabricator, working alongside his parents on &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot; as design supervisor. Through his son, Froud has one grandson.

==Artistic style and influences==
Froud&#x27;s artwork frequently draws upon fairy tales and European folklore. His paintings of fairies are known for recontexualising Victorian and Edwardian-era beliefs about fairies and were part of a revival of fairy painting seen during the late 20th century. 

Among Froud&#x27;s major influences are the 19th and early 20th-century illustrators Arthur Rackham, Edmund Dulac, and Richard Dadd. Froud cites the early influence of Rackham, &quot;in particular, [Rackham&#x27;s] drawings of trees that had faces&quot;, as sparking his interest in illustrating fairy tales, and describes having had a love of nature from childhood that has informed his style. He is frequently inspired by the landscape of Dartmoor. Other influences Froud cites include the Robinson brothers (Thomas, Charles and William), the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris and Northern European art from the 1500s and 1600s. He has stated that he was fascinated by Greek, Druid, Celtic and German 15th-century history and mythology. Froud&#x27;s work has also been influenced by Arthurian legend, &quot;com[ing] from Glastonbury as a sacred centre&quot;. Jeremiah Horrigan of the &quot;Poughkeepsie Journal&quot; wrote that Froud&#x27;s style &quot;echoes not only the great 19th century illustrators he reveres, but also harbors a wealth of elements ranging from Medieval to ancient Celtic and Nordic folk art.&quot;

<doc id="65091" wikidata="Q184067" url="?curid=65091" title="Pika">
<text>A pika ( , or ) is a small, mountain-dwelling mammal native to Asia and North America. With short limbs, a very round body, an even coat of fur, and no external tail, they resemble their close relative the rabbit, but with short, rounded ears. The large-eared pika of the Himalayas and nearby mountains lives at elevations of more than .

The name &quot;pika&quot; appears to be derived from the Tungus &quot;pika&quot;, and the scientific name &quot;Ochotona&quot; is derived from the Mongolian word &quot;ogotno, оготно&quot;, which means pika. It is used for any member of the Ochotonidae (), a family within the order of lagomorphs, the order which also includes the Leporidae (rabbits and hares). They are the smallest animal in the lagomorph group. Only one genus, Ochotona ( or ), is extant within the family, covering 37 species, though many fossil genera are known. Another species, the Sardinian pika, belonging to the separate genus &quot;Prolagus&quot;, has become extinct within the last 2,000 years owing to human activity.

Pikas prefer rocky slopes and graze on a range of plants, primarily grasses, flowers, and young stems. In the autumn, they pull hay, soft twigs, and other stores of food under rocks to eat during the long, cold winter. The pika is also known as the whistling hare because of its high-pitched alarm call it gives when alarmed. The two species found in North America are the American pika, found primarily in the mountains of the western United States and far southwestern Canada, and the collared pika of northern British Columbia, the Yukon, western Northwest Territories and Alaska.

==Habitat==
Pikas are native to cold climates in Asia and North America. Most species live on rocky mountainsides, where numerous crevices are available for their shelter, although some pikas also construct crude burrows. A few burrowing species are native to open steppe land. In the mountains of Eurasia, pikas often share their burrows with snowfinches, which build their nests there. Changing temperatures have forced some pika populations to restrict their ranges to even higher elevations.

==Characteristics==

Pikas are small mammals, with short limbs and rounded ears. They are about in body length and weigh between , depending on species.

These animals are herbivores and feed on a wide variety of plant matter, including forbs, grasses, sedges, shrub twigs, moss and lichens. Easily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract and expelled as regular feces. But in order to get nutrients out of hard to digest fiber, pika ferment fiber in the cecum (in the GI tract) and then expel the contents as cecotropes, which are reingested (cecotrophy). The cecotropes are then absorbed in the small intestine to utilize the nutrients.

Collared pikas have been known to store dead birds in their burrows for food during winter and eat the feces of other animals.

As with other lagomorphs, pikas have gnawing incisors and no canines, although they have fewer molars than rabbits. They have a dental formula of = 26. Another similarity that pikas share with other lagomorphs is that the bottom of their paws are covered with fur and lack paw pads.

Rock-dwelling pikas have small litters of fewer than five young, whilst the burrowing species tend to give birth to more young and to breed more frequently, possibly owing to a greater availability of resources in their native habitats. The young are born altricial (eyes and ears closed, no fur) after a gestation period of between 25 and 30 days.

==Activity==

Pikas are active during daylight (diurnal) or twilight hours (crepuscular), with higher-elevation species generally being more active during the daytime. They show their peak activity just before the winter season. Pikas do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored. Rock-dwelling pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store in a &quot;haypile&quot; of cached plants.

The impact of human activity on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the 1970s. Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a process called &quot;haying&quot;. They eat the dried plants during the winter. When pikas mistake humans as predators, they may respond to humans as they do to other species that do prey on pikas. Such interactions with humans have been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months. Pikas prefer foraging in temperatures below , so they generally spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high. A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time, where for every increase of to the ambient temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.

Eurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Some species are territorial. North American pikas (&quot;O. princeps&quot; and &quot;O. collaris&quot;) are , leading solitary lives outside the breeding season.

==Vocalization==
Pikas have distinct calls, which vary in duration. The call can be short and quick, a little longer and more drawn out or long songs. The short calls are an example of geographic variation. The pikas determine the appropriate time to make short calls by listening for cues for sound localization. The calls are used for individual recognition, predator warning signals, territory defense, or as a way to attract potential mates. There are also different calls depending on the season. In the spring the songs become more frequent during the breeding season. In late summer the vocalizations become short calls. Through various studies, the acoustic characteristics of the vocalizations can be a useful taxonomic tool.

==Lifespan==
The average lifespan of pikas in the wild is roughly seven years. A pika&#x27;s age may be determined by the number of adhesion lines on the periosteal bone on the lower jaw. The lifespan does not differ between the sexes.

Paleontologists have also described multiple forms of pika not referred to specific species (&quot;Ochotona&quot; indet.) or not certainly identified (&quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;antiqua&quot;, &quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;cansus&quot;, &quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;daurica&quot;, &quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;eximia&quot;, &quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;gromovi&quot;, &quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;intermedia&quot;, &quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;koslowi&quot;, &quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;lagrelii&quot;, &quot;O.&quot; cf. &quot;nihewanica&quot;). The statuses of &quot;Ochotona&quot; (&quot;Proochotona&quot;) &quot;kirgisica&quot; and &quot;O. spelaeus&quot; are uncertain.

The &quot;pusilla&quot; group of pikas is characterized by archaic (plesiomorphic) cheek teeth and small size.

The North American species migrated from Eurasia. They invaded the New World twice:

* &quot;O. spanglei&quot; during the latest Miocene or early Pliocene, followed by a roughly three-million-year-long gap in the known North American pika record
*&quot;O. whartoni&quot; (giant pika) and small pikas via the Bering Land Bridge during the earliest Pleistocene

&quot;Ochotona&quot; cf. &quot;whartoni&quot; and small pikas of the &quot;O. pusilla&quot; group are also known from Siberia. The extant, endemic North American species appeared in the Pleistocene. The North American collared pika (&quot;O. collaris&quot;) and American pika (&quot;O. princeps&quot;) have been suggested to have descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (&quot;O. pusilla&quot;).

The range of &quot;Ochotona&quot; was larger in the past, with both extinct and extant species inhabiting Western Europe and Eastern North America, areas that are currently free of pikas. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika &quot;O. pusilla&quot; currently native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern pika &quot;O. hyperborea&quot; in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.

While &quot;Ochotona&quot; is the only currently living genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include †&quot;Albertona&quot;, †&quot;Alloptox&quot;, †&quot;Amphilagus&quot;, †&quot;Australagomys&quot;, †&quot;Austrolagomys&quot;, †&quot;Bellatona&quot;, †&quot;Bellatonoides&quot;, †&quot;Bohlinotona&quot;, †&quot;Cuyamalagus&quot;, †&quot;Desmatolagus&quot;, †&quot;Eurolagus&quot;, †&quot;Gripholagomys&quot;, †&quot;Gymnesicolagus&quot;, †&quot;Hesperolagomys&quot;, †&quot;Heterolagus&quot;, †&quot;Kenyalagomys&quot;, †&quot;Lagopsis&quot;, †&quot;Marcuinomys&quot;, †&quot;Ochotonoides&quot;, †&quot;Ochotonoma&quot;, †&quot;Oklahomalagus&quot;, †&quot;Oreolagus&quot;, †&quot;Paludotona&quot;, †&quot;Piezodus&quot;, †&quot;Plicalagus&quot;, †&quot;Pliolagomys&quot;, †&quot;Prolagus&quot;, †&quot;Proochotona&quot; (syn. &quot;Ochotona&quot;), †&quot;Pseudobellatona&quot;, †&quot;Ptychoprolagus&quot;, †&quot;Russellagus&quot;, †&quot;Sinolagomys&quot;, †&quot;Titanomys&quot; and †&quot;Tonomochota&quot;. The earliest one is &quot;Desmatolagus&quot; (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5–14.8 Ma), usually included in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid stem-lagomorphs.

Ochotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the &quot;climatic optimum&quot; from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. They thrived in Eurasia, North America, and even Africa. The peak of their diversity occurred during the period from the early Miocene to middle Miocene. Most of them became extinct during the transition from the Miocene to Pliocene, which was accompanied by an increase in diversity of the &quot;leporids&quot;. It has been proposed that this switch between ochotonids and larger leporids was caused by expansion of C4 plants (particularly the Poaceae) related to global cooling in the late Miocene, since extant pikas reveal a strong preference for C3 plants (Asteraceae, Rosaceae, and Fabaceae, many of them C3). Replacement of large areas of forests by open grassland first started probably in North America and is called sometimes &quot;nature&#x27;s green revolution&quot;.

<doc id="65092" wikidata="Q5987181" url="?curid=65092" title="Ida Rentoul Outhwaite">
<text>Ida Rentoul Outhwaite, also known as Ida Sherbourne Rentoul and Ida Sherbourne Outhwaite (9 June 1888 – 25 June 1960), was an Australian illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Her work mostly depicted magical creatures, such as elves and fairies.

== Early life ==
Ida Rentoul was born in Carlton, Victoria, the youngest child of four and second daughter of the Rev. John Laurence Rentoul, an Irish-born Presbyterian minister and academic, and his wife Annie Isobel (née Rattray). At the time of her birth, her father was a professor at Ormond College, University of Melbourne, and later moderator-general of his church between 1912 and 1914. When World War I broke out, he became chaplain-general of the First Australian Imperial Force.

She was educated at Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, Melbourne. After she married Arthur Grenbry Outhwaite on 8 December 1909, she was generally known as Ida Rentoul Outhwaite. Before this, she had variously signed her work I.S.R. and at some point changed this to I.R.O. She also occasionally used I.S.R.O. and full spellings rather than abbreviations.

== Career ==
Outhwaite worked predominantly with pen and ink, and watercolour. Her first illustration was published by &quot;New Idea&quot; magazine in 1903 when she was just 15 years of age – it accompanied a story written by her older sister, Annie Rattray Rentoul. In the years that followed, the sisters collaborated on a number of stories.

In 1907 the important Australian Exhibition of Women&#x27;s Work took place for five weeks in Melbourne. She and her sister showed their &quot;Australian Songs for Young and Old&quot; which included music by Georgette Peterson.

Following her marriage, she also collaborated with her husband – most notably for &quot;The Enchanted Forest&quot; (1921), &quot;The Little Fairy Sister&quot; (1923) and &quot;Fairyland&quot; (1926). In a number of cases, her children – Robert, Anne, Wendy and William – served as models for her illustrations.

== Works ==
Publications carrying her illustrations include:
* The Fairies of Fern Gully (1903)
* &quot;Mollie&#x27;s Bunyip&quot; (1904)
* &quot;Mollie&#x27;s Staircase&quot; (1906)

* &quot;The Guinea Pig that wanted a Tail&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Legends of the Outback&quot; (1958) by Phyllis Power

Her works (including advertising images) were also published in periodicals and newspapers such as &quot;The New Idea&quot;, &quot;The Native Companion&quot;, &quot;Australia Today,&quot; and the &quot;British-Australasian&quot;.

Her illustrations were exhibited throughout Australia, as well as in London and Paris between 1907 and 1933.

== Legacy ==
She died in Australia at Caulfield, Victoria in 1960.

In her lifetime, she inspired a number of artists including Edith Alsop, Ethel Spowers, and Ethel Jackson Morris.

Her work is depicted in four stained glass windows in an adjoining hall at St Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church in Fitzroy, Victoria.

In 1985 she was honoured on a postage stamp, depicting an illustration from &quot;Elves and Fairies&quot;, issued by Australia Post.

<text>Richard Dadd (1 August 1817 – 7 January 1886) was an English painter of the Victorian era, noted for his depictions of fairies and other supernatural subjects, Orientalist scenes, and enigmatic genre scenes, rendered with obsessively minuscule detail. Most of the works for which he is best known were created while he was a patient in Bethlem and Broadmoor hospitals.

==Early life==
Dadd was born at Chatham, Kent, on 1 August 1817, the son of chemist Robert Dadd (1788/9–1843) and Mary Ann (1790–1824), daughter of the shipwright Richard Martin. He was educated at King&#x27;s School, Rochester, where his aptitude for drawing was evident at an early age, leading to his admission to the Royal Academy Art Schools at the age of 20. He was awarded the medal for life drawing in 1840. With William Powell Frith, Augustus Egg, Henry O&#x27;Neil and others, he founded The Clique, of which he was generally considered to be the leading talent. He was also trained at William Dadson&#x27;s Academy of Art.

==Career==

Among his best-known early works are the illustrations he produced for &quot;The Book of British Ballads&quot; (1842), and a frontispiece he designed for &quot;The Kentish Coronal&quot; (1840).

In July 1842, Sir Thomas Phillips, the former mayor of Newport, chose Dadd to accompany him as his draughtsman on an expedition through Europe to Greece, Turkey, Southern Syria and finally Egypt. In November of that year they spent a gruelling two weeks in Southern Syria, passing from Jerusalem to Jordan and returning across the Engaddi wilderness. Toward the end of December, while travelling up the Nile by boat, Dadd underwent a dramatic personality change, becoming delusional, increasingly violent, and believing himself to be under the influence of the Egyptian god Osiris. His condition was initially thought to be sunstroke.

===Mental illness and hospitalization===

On his return to England in May 1843, Dadd was diagnosed to be of unsound mind and was taken by his family to recuperate in the rural village of Cobham, Kent. In August of that year, having become convinced that his father was the Devil in disguise, Dadd killed him with a knife and fled to France. En route to Paris, Dadd attempted to kill a fellow passenger with a razor but was overpowered and arrested by police. Dadd confessed to killing his father and was returned to England, where he was committed to the criminal department of Bethlem psychiatric hospital (also known as Bedlam). There and subsequently at the newly created Broadmoor Hospital, Dadd was cared for in an enlightened manner by Doctors William Wood, William Orange and Sir William Charles Hood.

Dadd probably had paranoid schizophrenia. Two of his siblings had the condition, while a third had &quot;a private attendant&quot; for unknown reasons.

In hospital, Dadd was encouraged to continue painting, and in 1852 he created a portrait of one of his doctors, Alexander Morison, which now hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Dadd painted many of his masterpieces in Bethlem and Broadmoor, including &quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&quot;, which he worked on between 1855 and 1864. Dadd was pictured at work on his &quot;Contradiction: Oberon and Titania&quot; by the London society photographer . Also dating from the 1850s are the 33 watercolour drawings titled &quot;Sketches to Illustrate the Passions&quot;, which include &quot;Grief or Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;, and &quot;Jealousy&quot;, as well as &quot;Agony-Raving Madness&quot; and &quot;Murder&quot;. Like most of his works, these are executed on a small scale and feature protagonists whose eyes are fixed in a peculiar, unfocused stare. Dadd also produced many shipping scenes and landscapes during his hospitalization, such as the ethereal 1861 watercolour &quot;Port Stragglin&quot;. These are executed with a miniaturist&#x27;s eye for detail, which belies the fact that they are products of imagination and memory.

==Death==
After 20 years at Bethlem, Dadd was moved to Broadmoor Hospital, a newly built high-security facility in Berkshire. There he remained for the remainder of his life, painting constantly and receiving infrequent visitors; he died on 7 January 1886, &quot;from an extensive disease of the lungs&quot;. A &quot;substantial number&quot; of his works are on display in the Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum.

==Legacy==

Freddie Mercury was inspired to write the song &#x27;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&#x27; based on Dadd&#x27;s painting, which he had seen at the Tate Gallery. In 2013 Neil Gaiman wrote an essay about the painting for the magazine &quot;Intelligent Life&quot; (now called &quot;1843&quot;).

Angela Carter wrote &quot;Come unto these Yellow Sands&quot;, a radio-play based on Dadd&#x27;s life, first broadcast in 1979.

Canadian author R. J. Anderson acknowledges Dadd as the basis of her fictional painter Alfred Wrenfield, who figures prominently in her young adult fantasy novel &quot;Knife&quot; (2009)&quot;.

In 1987, a long-lost watercolour by Dadd, &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Halt in the Desert&quot;, was discovered by Peter Nahum on the BBC TV programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. Made while the artist was incarcerated, it is based on sketches made during his tour of the Middle East, and shows his party encamped by the Dead Sea, with Dadd at the far right. It was later sold for £100,000 to the British Museum.

Loreena McKennitt features Dadd&#x27;s 1862 painting &quot;Bacchanalian Scene&quot; on the cover of her 1987 Christmas CD &quot;To Drive the Cold Winter Away&quot;.

Terry Pratchett included &quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&quot; in his 2003 Discworld novel &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;. Tiffany, the protagonist, finds it in a book of fairy-tales and later escapes from a dream set within the picture. In the author&#x27;s note, Pratchett describes the painting and gives a brief but sympathetic summary of Dadd&#x27;s personal history and struggle with mental illness.

<text>Cicely Mary Barker (28 June 1895 – 16 February 1973) was the illustrator who created the famous Flower Fairies, in the shape of ethereal smiling children with butterfly wings. As a child, she was greatly influenced by the works of the illustrator Kate Greenaway, whom she assiduously copied in her formative years. Her principal influence, however, which she duly credited, was the artwork of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

== Early life ==
Cicely Mary Barker was born in 1895 in Croydon, England. She suffered from epilepsy as a child and remained physically delicate for most of her life. She was unable to go to school, so she was educated at home and spent much of her time on her own, reading and drawing.

In 1908, when Cicely was 13, her father enrolled her at the Croydon Art Society, where they both exhibited work. She also enrolled in a Correspondence Art course which she continued until 1918. At 16, Cicely was elected a life member of Croydon Art Society, the youngest person ever to receive this honour. The art critic for the &quot;Croydon Advertiser&quot; commented: &quot;Her drawings show a remarkable freedom of spirit. She has distinct promise.&quot;

In 1911, when she was 15 her father submitted some of her work to Raphael Tuck, the stationery printer, who bought four of her pictures for greeting cards. From this time onwards, she was able to sell her work to magazines, to postcard and greeting card manufacturers, and later to book publishers. This was very helpful to the family finances for her father died when she was 17, leaving Cicely, her elder sister and her mother in difficult circumstances.

Cicely was industrious and determined. She sent her flower fairy paintings to several publishers before Blackie accepted them for publication in 1923. She was paid only £25 for a total of twenty-four illustrations and verses in &quot;Flower Fairies of the Spring&quot;, the first of the Flower Fairy series. Seven more little books about Fairies were to follow.

== Fairy art ==

Cicely was also influenced by the huge popular interest in fairies which developed from the Victorian enthusiasm for fairy stories and was epitomised by the immense popularity of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in the early part of the 20th century. Published in 1923, &quot;Flower Fairies of the Spring&quot; was well received by a post-industrial, war-weary public who were charmed by her vision of hope and innocence, which seemed to evoke a less aggressively modern world.
Queen Mary did much to encourage the vogue for fairy paintings during the 1920s by frequently sending postcards depicting fairies to her friends. This popularity saw the publication of Cicely Mary Barker&#x27;s Elves and Fairies postcards in 1918.

Barker always used real-life models for her paintings. Most of the models came from the kindergarten her sister Dorothy ran in the back room of the house in which they lived. She also painted the children and relatives. One of her models was Gladys Tidy, the young girl who came to the house every Saturday to do the household work.

Barker always asked the child model to hold the flower, twig or blossom of a particular fairy, for she wanted to be sure of the accuracy of her depiction of the shape, texture and form of the plant. Her only alteration was to the size, she enlarged the flower to make it the same size as the child.

Her flowers are always botanically accurate. If she could not find a flower close at hand, she enlisted the help of staff at Kew Gardens, who would often visit with specimens for her to paint. She wrote in the foreword to &quot;Flower Fairies of the Wayside&quot;:

== Christian art ==
Barker&#x27;s art reflects several strong influences. Her family was deeply religious and she retained a strong Christian faith all her life. She greatly admired the work of the Pre-Raphaelites and her own work echoes their philosophy of being true to nature both in her meticulous depiction of flowers and plants and in the way in which the fairies represent their spirit.

Canon Ingram Hill remembers her as &quot;one of the pillars&quot; of St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, Croydon. Her faith informed all of her work, religious or secular, whether in cards, children&#x27;s books or decorating the churches with which she was affiliated.

In 1916, Barker designed eight mission postcards, including &quot;Prayer&quot;, a picture of a young woman kneeling before an open window, possibly modelled on her sister. In 1923, she painted a series of five birthday cards featuring angels and babies for The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.

Starting in 1920, Barker painted many religious works, including illustrated Bible stories, written with her sister Dorothy. She also painted panels and triptych for chapels and churches including &quot;The Feeding of the Five Thousand&quot; for the chapel at Penarth and &quot;The Parable of the Great Supper&quot; for the chapel of St. George&#x27;s Waddon.

In 1926, Queen Mary purchased one of her religious paintings, entitled &quot;The Darling of the World Has Come&quot;.

<text>Sir Thomas de Ercildoun, better remembered as Thomas the Rhymer (fl. c. 1220 – 1298), also known as Thomas Learmont or True Thomas, was a Scottish laird and reputed prophet from Earlston (then called &quot;Erceldoune&quot;) in the Borders. Thomas&#x27; gift of prophecy is linked to his poetic ability.

He is often cited as the author of the English &quot;Sir Tristrem&quot;, a version of the Tristram legend, and some lines in Robert Mannyng&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; may be the source of this association. It is not clear if the name &quot;Rhymer&quot; was his actual surname or merely a sobriquet.

In literature, he appears as the protagonist in the tale about Thomas the Rhymer carried off by the &quot;Queen of Elfland&quot; and returned having gained the gift of prophecy, as well as the inability to tell a lie. The tale survives in a medieval verse romance in five manuscripts, as well as in the popular ballad &quot;Thomas Rhymer&quot; (Child Ballad number 37). The romance occurs as &quot;Thomas off Ersseldoune&quot; in the Lincoln Thornton Manuscript.

The original romance (from c. 1400) was probably condensed into ballad form (c. 1700), though there are dissenting views on this. Walter Scott expanded the ballad into three parts, adding a sequel which incorporated the prophecies ascribed to Thomas, and an epilogue where Thomas is summoned back to Elfland after the appearance of a sign, in the form of the milk-white hart and . Numerous prose retellings of the tale of Thomas the Rhymer have been undertaken, and included in fairy tale or folk-tale anthologies; these often incorporate the return to Fairyland episode that Scott reported to have learned from local legend.

==Historical figure==

Sir Thomas was born in Erceldoune (also spelled &quot;Ercildoune&quot; – presently Earlston), Berwickshire, sometime in the 13th century, and has a reputation as the author of many prophetic verses. Little is known for certain of his life but two charters from 1260 to 1280 and 1294 mention him, the latter referring to &quot;Thomas de Ercildounson son and heir of Thome Rymour de Ercildoun&quot;.

Thomas became known as &quot;True Thomas&quot;, supposedly because he could not tell a lie. Popular lore recounts how he prophesied many great events in Scottish history, including the death of Alexander III of Scotland.

Popular esteem of Thomas lived on for centuries after his death, and especially in Scotland, overtook the reputation of all rival prophets including Merlin, whom the 16th century pamphleteer of &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot; denounced as the author of the prophecy (unity under one king) which the English used as justification for aggression against his countrymen. It became common for fabricated prophecies (or reworkings of earlier prophecies) to be attributed to Thomas to enhance their authority, as seen in collections of prophecies which were printed, the earliest surviving being a chapbook entitled &quot;The Whole Prophecie of Scotland, England, etc.&quot; (1603).

==Prophecies attributed to Thomas==
Descriptions and paraphrases of Thomas&#x27;s prophecies were given by various Scottish historians of yore, though none of them quoted directly from Thomas.

*&quot;On the morrow, afore noon, shall blow the greatest wind that ever was heard before in Scotland.&quot;
::This prophecy predicted the death of Alexander III in 1286. Thomas gave this prediction to the Earl of Dunbar, but when there was no change in weather patterns discernible at the ninth hour, the Earl sent for the prophet to be reproved. Thomas replied the appointed hour has not come, and shortly thereafter, the news came reporting of the king&#x27;s death.

::The earliest notice of this prophecy occurs in Bower&#x27;s 15th-century &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;, written in Latin. An early English vernacular source is John Bellenden&#x27;s 16th century &quot;Croniklis of Scotland,&quot; a translation of Hector Boece.

*&quot;Who shal rule the ile of Bretaine / From the North to the South sey?&quot;
:&quot;A French wife shal beare the Son, / Shall rule all Bretaine to the sey,&quot;
:&quot;that of the Bruces blood shall come / As neere as the nint degree.&quot;
::The lines given are structured in the form of one man&#x27;s questions, answered by another, who goes on to identify himself: &quot;In Erlingstoun, I dwelle at hame/Thomas Rymour men calles me.&quot;

::Printed in the aforementioned chapbook &quot;The Whole Prophecie&quot; of 1603, published upon the death of Elizabeth I, the prophecy purports to have presaged Scottish rule of all of Britain by James I, whose mother Mary Stewart, had been raised in her own mother&#x27;s native France and was briefly their Queen Consort during her first childless marriage to Francis II.

::This &quot;became in the sequel by far the most famous of all the prophecies,&quot; but it has been argued that this is a rehash of an earlier prophecy that was originally meant for John Stewart, Duke of Albany (d. 1536), whose mother was Anna de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, daughter of the Count of Auvergne. Words not substantially different are also given in the same printed book, under the preceding section for the prophecy of John of Bridlington, and the additional date clue there &quot;1513 &amp; thrise three there after&quot; facilitating the identification &quot;Duke&#x27;s son&quot; in question as Duke of Albany, although Murray noted that the Duke&#x27;s &quot;performance of ... doubty deeds&quot; was something he &quot;utterly failed to do&quot;.

===Popular folkloric prophecies===
Walter Scott was familiar with rhymes purported to be the Rhymer&#x27;s prophecies in the local popular tradition, and published several of them. Later Robert Chambers printed additional collected rhyme prophecies ascribed to Thomas, in &quot;Popular Rhymes&quot; (1826).

*&quot;At Eildon Tree, if yon shall be,&quot;
:&quot;a brig ower Tweed yon there may see.&quot;
::Scott identifies the tree as that on Eildon Hill in Melrose, some five miles away from today&#x27;s Earlston. Three bridges built across the river were visible from that vantage point in Scott&#x27;s day.

*&quot;This Thorn-Tree, as lang as it stands,&quot;
:&quot;Earlstoun sall possess a&#x27; her lands.&quot;
::or &quot;As long as the Thorn Tree stands / Ercildourne shall keep its lands&quot;. This was first of several prophecies attributed to the Rhymer collected by Chambers, who identified the tree in question as one that fell in a storm in either 1814 or 1821, presumably on the about the last remaining acre belonging to the town of Earlstoun. The prophecy was lent additional weight at the time, because as it so happened, the merchants of the town had fallen under bankruptcy by a series of &quot;unfortunate circumstances&quot;. According to one account, &quot;Rhymer&#x27;s thorn&quot; was a huge tree growing in the garden of the Black Bull Inn, whose proprietor, named Thin, had its roots cut all around, leaving it vulnerable to the storm that same year.

*&quot;When the Yowes o&#x27; Gowrie come to land, &quot;
:&quot;The Day o&#x27; Judgment&#x27;s near at hand&quot;
::The &quot;Ewes of Gowrie&quot; are two boulders near Invergowrie protruding from the Firth of Tay, said to approach the land at the rate of an inch a year. This couplet was also published by Chambers, though filed under a different locality (Perthshire), and he ventured to guess that the ancient prophecy was &quot;perhaps by Thomas the Rhymer.&quot; Barbara Ker Wilson&#x27;s retold version has altered the rhyme, including the name of the rocks thus: &quot;When the Cows o&#x27; Gowrie come to land / The Judgement Day is near at hand.&quot;

*&quot;York was, London is, and Edinbruch &#x27;ill be,&quot;
:&quot;the biggest and the bonniest o&#x27; a&#x27; the three&quot;
::Collected from a 72-year-old man resident in Edinburgh.

The Weeping Stones Curse:
*&quot;Fyvie, Fyvie thou&#x27;se never thrive,&quot;
:&quot;&#x27;s there&#x27;s in thee three :&quot;
:&quot;There&#x27;s intill the highest tower,&quot;
:&quot;There&#x27;s ane intill the ladye&#x27;s bower,&quot;
:&quot;There&#x27;s ane aneath the water-, &quot;
:&quot;And thir three stanes ye&#x27;se never get.&quot;
::Tradition in Aberdeenshire said that Fyvie Castle stood seven years awaiting arrival of &quot;True Tammas,&quot; as the Rhymer was called in the local dialect. The Rhymer arrived carrying a storm that brewed all around him, though perfectly calm around his person, and pronounced the above curse. Two of the stones were found, but the third stone of the water-gate eluded discovery. And since 1885 no eldest son has lived to succeed his father.

*&quot;&quot;Betide, betide, whate&#x27;er betide,&quot;
:&quot;Haig shall be Haig of Bemerside.&quot;
::This prophesied the ancient family of the Haigs of Bemerside will survive for perpetuity. Chambers, in a later editions his &quot;Popular Rhymes&quot; (1867) prematurely reported that &quot;the prophecy has come to a sad end, for the Haigs of Bemerside have died out.&quot; In fact, Field Marshal Douglas Haig hails from this family, and was created earl in 1919, currently succeeded by the 3rd Earl (b. 1961).

==Ballad==

The ballad (Roud 219) around the legend of Thomas was catalogued Child Ballad #37 &quot;Thomas the Rymer,&quot; by Francis James Child in 1883. Child published three versions, which he labelled A, B and C, but later appended two more variants in Volume 4 of his collection of ballads, published in 1892. Some scholars refer to these as Child&#x27;s D and E versions. Version A, which is a Mrs Brown&#x27;s recitation, and C, which is Walter Scott&#x27;s reworking of it, were together classed as the Brown group by C.E. Nelson, while versions B, D, E are all considered by Nelson to be descendants of an archetype that reduced the romance into ballad form in about 1700, and classed as the &#x27;Greenwood group&#x27;. (See §Ballad sources).

Child provided a critical synopsis comparing versions A, B, C in his original publication, and considerations of the D, E versions have been added below.

===Ballad synopsis===
The brief outline of the ballad is that while Thomas is lying outdoors on a slope by a tree in the Erceldoune neighborhood, the queen of Elfland appears to him riding upon a horse and beckons him to come away. When he consents, she shows him three marvels: the road to Heaven, the road to Hell, and the road to her own world (which they follow). After seven years, Thomas is brought back into the mortal realm. Asking for a token by which to remember the queen, he is offered the choice of having powers of harpistry, or else of prophecy, and of these he chooses the latter.
The scene of Thomas&#x27;s encounter with the elf-queen is &quot;Huntly Bank&quot; and the &quot;Eildon Tree&quot; (versions B, C, and E) or &quot;Farnalie&quot; (version D) All these refer to the area of Eildon Hills, in the vicinity of Earlston: Huntly Bank was a slope on the hill and the tree stood there also, as Scott explained: Emily B. Lyle was able to localize &quot;farnalie&quot; there as well.

The queen wears a skirt of grass-green silk and a velvet mantle, and is mounted either on a milk-white steed (in Ballad A), or on a dapple-gray horse (B, D, E and R (the Romance)). The horse has nine and fifty bells on each &quot;&quot; (Scots English. &quot;lock of matted hair&quot;) on its mane in A, nine hung on its mane in E, and three bells on either side of the bridle in R, whereas she had nine bells in her hand in D, offered as a prize for his harping and (music and storytelling).

Thomas mistakenly addresses her as the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot; (i.e. the Virgin Mary), which she corrects by identifying herself as &quot;Queen of fair Elfland&quot; (A, C). In other variants, she reticently identifies herself only as &quot;lady of an land&quot; (B), or &quot;lady gay&quot; (E), much like the medieval romance. But since the unnamed land of the queen is approached by a path leading neither to Heaven nor Hell, etc., it can be assumed to be &quot;Fairyland,&quot; to put it in more modern terminology.

In C and E, the queen dares Thomas to kiss her lips, a corruption of Thomas&#x27;s embrace in the romance that is lacking in A and B though crucial to a cogent plot, since &quot;it is contact with the fairy that gives her the power to carry her paramour off&quot; according to Child. Absent in the ballads also is the motif of the queen losing her beauty (Loathly lady motif): Child considered that the &quot;ballad is no worse, and the romance would have been much better&quot; without it, &quot;impressive&quot; though it may be, since it did not belong in his opinion to the &quot;proper and original story,&quot; which he thought was a blithe tale like that of Ogier the Dane and Morgan le fay. If he chooses to go with her, Thomas is warned he will be unable to return for seven years (A, B, D, E). In the romance the queen&#x27;s warning is &quot;only for a twelvemonth&quot;, but he overstays by more than three (or seven) years.

Then she wheels around her milk-white steed and lets Thomas ride on the behind (A, C), or she rides the dapple-gray while he runs (B, E). He must wade knee-high through a river (B, C, E), exaggerated as an expanse of blood (perhaps &quot;river of blood&quot;), in A. They reach a &quot;garden green,&quot; and Thomas wants to pluck a fruit to slake his hunger but the queen interrupts, admonishing him that he will be accursed or damned (A, B, D, E). The language in B suggests this is &quot;the fruit of the Forbidden Tree&quot;, and variants D, E call it an apple. The queen provides Thomas with food to sate his hunger.

The queen now tells Thomas to lay his head to rest on her knee (A, B, C), and shows him three marvels (&quot; three&quot;), which are the road to Hell, the road to Heaven, and the road to her homeland (named Elfland in A). It is the road beyond the meadow or lawn overgrown with lilies that leads to Heaven, except in C where the looks deceive and the lily road leads to Hell, while the thorny road leads to Heaven.

The queen instructs Thomas not to speak to others in Elfland, and to allow her to do all the talking. In the end, he receives as present &quot;a coat of the even cloth, and a pair of shoes of velvet green&quot; (A) or &quot;tongue that can never lie&quot; (B) or both (C). Version E uniquely mentions the Queen&#x27;s fear that Thomas may be chosen as &quot; unto hell&quot;, that is to say, the in the form of humans that Elfland is obliged to pay periodically. In the romance, the Queen explains that the collection of the &quot;fee to hell&quot; draws near, and Thomas must be sent back to earth to spare him from that peril. (See § Literary criticism for further literary analysis.)

===Ballad sources===
The ballad was first printed by Walter Scott (1803), and then by Robert Jamieson (1806). Both used Mrs Brown&#x27;s manuscript as the underlying source. Child A is represented by Mrs Brown&#x27;s MS and Jamieson&#x27;s published version (with only slight differences in wording). Child C is a composite of Mrs Brown&#x27;s and another version. In fact, 13 of the 20 stanzas are the same as A, and although Scott claims his version is from a &quot;copy, obtained from a lady residing not far from Ercildoun&quot; corrected using Mrs Brown&#x27;s MS, Nelson labels the seven different stanzas as something that is &quot;for most part Scott&#x27;s own, Gothic-romantic invention&quot;.

Child B is taken from the second volume of the Campbell manuscripts entitled &quot;Old Scottish Songs, Collected in the Counties of Berwick, Roxburgh, Selkirk &amp; Peebles&quot;, dating to ca. 1830. The Leyden transcript, or Child &quot;D&quot; was supplied to Walter Scott before his publication, and influenced his composition of the C version to some degree. The text by Mrs Christiana Greenwood, or Child &quot;E&quot; was &quot;sent to Scott in May of 1806 after reading his C version in the &quot;Minstrelsey&quot;, and was dated by Nelson as an &quot;early to mid-eighteenth-century text&quot;. These two versions were provided to Scott and were among his papers at Abbotsford.

====Mrs Brown&#x27;s ballads====
Mrs Brown, also known as Anna Gordon or Mrs Brown of Falkland (1747–1810), who was both Scott&#x27;s and Jamieson&#x27;s source, maintained that she had heard them sung to her as a child. She had learned to sing a repertoire of some three dozen ballads from her aunt, Mrs Farquheson. Mrs Brown&#x27;s nephew Robert Eden Scott transcribed the music, and the manuscript was available to Scott and others. However different accounts have been given, such as &quot;an old maid-servant who had been long as the nursemaid being the one to teach Mrs Brown.&quot;

===Walter Scott&#x27;s ballads in three parts===
In &quot;Minstrelsy&quot;, Walter Scott published a second part to the ballad out of Thomas&#x27;s prophecies, and yet a third part describing Thomas&#x27;s return to Elfland. The third part was based on the legend with which Scott claimed to be familiar, telling that &quot;while Thomas was making merry with his friends in the Tower of Ercildoune,&quot; there came news that &quot;a hart and hind... was parading the street of the village.&quot; Hearing this, Thomas got up and left, never to be seen again, leaving a popular belief that he had gone to Fairyland but was &quot;one day expected to revisit earth&quot;. Murray cites Robert Chambers&#x27;s suspicion that this may have been a mangled portrayal of a living local personage, and gives his own less marvellous traditional account of Thomas&#x27;s disappearance, as he had received it from an informant.

In Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Third Part&quot; to the ballad, Thomas finds himself in possession of a &quot;elfin harp he won&quot; in Fairyland in a minstrel competition. This is a departure both from the traditional ballad and from the medieval romance, in which the queen tells Thomas to choose whether &quot;to harpe or carpe,&quot; that is, to make a choice either of the gift of music or of the gift of speech. The &quot;hart and hind&quot; is now being sung as being &quot;white as snow on Fairnalie&quot; (Farnalie has been properly identified by Lyle, as discussed above). Some prose retellings incorporate some features derived from this third part (See §Retellings).

=== Duncan Williamson ===
The traditional singer Duncan Williamson, a Scottish traveller who learned his songs from his family and fellow travellers, had a traditional version of the ballad which he was recorded singing on several occasions. One recording (and discussion of the song) can be heard on the Tobar an Dualchais website.

==Medieval romance==

The surviving medieval romance is a lengthier account which agrees with the content of the ballad.

The romance opens in the first person (migrating to the third), but probably is not genuinely Thomas&#x27;s own work. Murray dated the authorship to &quot;shortly after 1400, or about a hundred years after Thomas&#x27;s death&quot;, but more recent researchers set the date earlier, to the (late) 14th century. The romance often alludes to &quot;the story,&quot; as if there had been a preceding recension, and Child supposed that the &quot;older story,&quot; if any such thing actually existed, &quot;must be the work of Thomas&quot;.

As in ballad C, Huntley banks is the locale where Thomas made sighting of the elfin lady. The &quot;Eldoune, Eldone tree (Thornton, I, 80, 84)&quot; is also mentioned as in the ballad. Thomas is captivated by her, addressing her as queen of heaven, and she answers she is not so lofty, but hints she is of fairy kind. Thomas propositions her, but she warns him off saying that the slightest sin will undo her beauty. Thomas is undaunted, so she gives the &quot;Mane of Molde&quot; (i.e. Man of Earth; mortal man) (I, 117) consent to marry her and to accompany her.

&quot;Seven tymes by hyr he lay,&quot; (I, 124), but she transforms into a hideous hag immediately after lying with him, and declares he shall not see &quot;&quot; (I,160) for a twelvemonth (&quot;twelmoneth&quot;, &quot;xij Mones&quot; vv.152, 159). As in the ballad, the lady points out one way towards heaven and another towards hell during their journey to her dominion (ca.200–220). The lady is followed by greyhounds and &quot;raches&quot; (i.e. scent dogs) (249–50). On arrival, Thomas is entertained with food and dancing, but then the lady tells him he must leave. To Thomas, his sojourn seems to last for only three days, but the lady tells him that three years (&quot;thre ȝere&quot;), or seven years (&quot;seuen ȝere&quot;), have passed (284–6) (the manuscripts vary), and he is brought back to the Elidon tree.

Fytte II is mostly devoted to prophecies. In the opening, Thomas asks for a token by which to remember the queen, and she offers him the choice of becoming a harper or a prophet (&quot;harpe or carpe&quot;). Rather than the &quot;instrumental&quot; gift, Thomas opts for the &quot;vocal (rather &quot;oral&quot;) accomplishments.&quot; Thomas asks her to abide a bit and tell him some &quot;ferlys&quot; (marvels). She now starts to tell of future battles at Halidon Hill, Bannockburn, etc., which are easily identifiable historic engagements. (These are tabulated by Murray in his introduction.)

The prophecies of battles continue into Fytte III, but the language becomes symbolic. Near the end Thomas asks why Black Agnes of Dunbar (III, 660) imprisoned him, and she predicts her death. This mention of Black Agnes is an anachronism, Thomas of Erceldoune having lived a whole generation before her, and she was presumably confused with an earlier Countess of the March.

===Manuscript sources===
The medieval romance survives complete or in fragments in five manuscripts, the earliest of which is the Lincoln codex compiled by Robert Thornton:
* Thornton MS. (olim. Lincoln A., 1. 17) – ca. 1430–1440.
* MS. Cambridge Ff. 5, 48 – mid 15th century.
* MS. Cotton Vitellius E. x., – late 15th century.
* MS. Landsowne 762 – ca. 1524–30
* MS. Sloane 2578 MSS. – 1547. Lacks first fitt.
All these texts were edited in parallel by J. A. H. Murray in &quot;The Romance and Prophecies of Thomas of Erceldoune&quot; (1875).

The Cotton MS. gives an &quot;Incipit prophecia Thome Arseldon&quot; and an &quot; prophetia thome de Arseldoune&quot;, thus this was the version that Walter Scott excerpted as Appendix. The Sloane MS. begins the second fytte with: &quot;Heare begynethe þe ijd fytt I saye / of S&quot;ir&quot; thom&quot;as&quot; of Arseldon,&quot; and the Thornton MS. gives the &quot; Thomas of Erseldowne&quot; after the 700th line.

===Relationship between romance and ballad forms===
The romance dates from the late 14th to the early 15th century (see below), while the ballad texts available do not antedate ca. 1700–1750 at the earliest. While some people believe that the romance gave rise to the ballads (in their existing forms) at a relatively late date, this view is not uncontroversial.

Walter Scott stated that the romance was &quot;the undoubted original&quot;, the ballad versions having been corrupted &quot;with changes by oral tradition&quot;. Murray flatly dismisses this inference of oral transmission, characterizing the ballad as a modernization by a contemporary versifier. Privately, Scott also held his &quot;suspicion of modern manufacture.&quot;

C. E. Nelson argued for a common archetype (from which all the ballads derive), composed around the year 1700 by &quot;a literate individual of antiquarian bent&quot; living in Berwickshire. Nelson starts off with a working assumption that the archetype ballad, &quot;a not too remote ancestor of [Mrs] Greenwood[&#x27;s version]&quot; was &quot;purposefully reduced from the romance&quot;. What made his argument convincing was his observation that the romance was actually &quot;printed as late as the seventeenth century&quot; (a printing of 1652 existed, republished ), a fact missed by several commentators and not noticed in Murray&#x27;s &quot;Published Texts&quot; section.

The localization of the archetype to Berwickshire is natural because the Greenwood group of ballads (which closely abide by the romance) belong to this area, and because this was the native place of the traditionary hero, Thomas of Erceldoune. Having made his examination, Nelson declared that his assumptions were justified by evidence, deciding in favour of the &quot;eighteenth-century origin and the subsequent tradition of [the ballad of] &#x27;Thomas Rhymer&#x27;&quot;, a conclusion applicable not only to the Greenwood group of ballads but also to the Brown group. This view is followed by Katharine Mary Briggs&#x27;s folk-tale dictionary of 1971, and David Fowler.

From the opposite point of view, Child thought that the ballad &quot;must be of considerable age&quot;, even though the earliest available to him was datable only to ca. 1700–1750. E. B. Lyle, who has published extensively on Thomas the Rhymer, presents the hypothesis that the ballad had once existed in a very early form upon which the romance was based as its source. One supporter of this view is Helen Cooper who remarks that the ballad &quot;has one of the strongest claims to medieval origins&quot;; another is Richard Firth Green who has provided strong evidence for his contention that &quot;continuous oral transmission is the only credible explanation,&quot; by showing that one detail in the medieval romance, omitted from the seventeenth-century print, is preserved in the Greenwood version.

===Literary criticism===
In the romance, the queen declares that Thomas has stayed three years but can remain no longer, because &quot;the foul fiend of Hell will come among the (fairy) folk and fetch his fee&quot; (modernized from Thornton text, vv.289–290). This &quot;fee&quot; &quot;refers to the common belief that the fairies &quot;paid kane&quot; to hell, by the sacrifice of one or more individuals to the devil every seventh year.&quot; (The word teind is actually used in the Greenwood variant of Thomas the Rymer: &quot;Ilka seven year, Thomas, / We pay our teindings unto hell, ... I fear, Thomas, it will be yerself&quot;.) The situation is akin to the one presented to the title character of &quot;Tam Lin&quot; who is in the company of the Queen of Fairies, but says he fears he will be given up as the tithe ( or kane) paid to hell. The common motif has been identified as type F.257 &quot;Tribute taken from fairies by fiend at stated periods&quot; except that while Tam Lin must devise his own rescue, in the case of the Rymer, &quot;the kindly queen of the fairies will not allow Thomas of Erceldoune to be exposed to this peril, and hurries him back to earth the day before the fiend comes for his due&quot;. J. R. R. Tolkien also alludes to the &quot;Devil&#x27;s tithe&quot; as concerns the Rhymer&#x27;s tale in a passing witty remark

====Influences====
It has been suggested that John Keats&#x27;s poem &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot; borrows motif and structure from the legend of Thomas the Rhymer.

Washington Irving, while visiting Walter Scott, was told the legend of Thomas the Rhymer, and it became one of the sources for Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;Rip van Winkle&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Retellings===
There have been numerous prose retelling of the ballad or legend.

John Tillotson&#x27;s version (1863) with &quot;magic harp he had won in Elfland&quot; and Elizabeth W. Greierson&#x27;s version (1906) with &quot;harp that was fashioned in Fairyland&quot; are couple of examples that incorporate the theme from Scott&#x27;s Part Three of Thomas vanishing back to Elfland after the sighting of a hart and hind in town.

Barbara Ker Wilson&#x27;s retold tale of &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; is a patchwork of all the traditions accrued around Thomas, including ballad and prophecies both written and popularly held.

* In Cencrastus, Issue 79, Winter 2004–05, Donald Smith published a &quot;new narrative adaptation of Ercildoun&#x27;s version which is much superior to Scott&#x27;s&quot; that runs to 31 stanzas.

===Musical adaptations===
* The German version of &quot;Tom der Reimer&quot; by Theodor Fontane was set as a song for male voice and piano by Carl Loewe, his op. 135.
** An outstanding early recording, in German is by Heinrich Schlusnus, on Polydor 67212, of 1938 (78 rpm).
* Modern versions of the &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; ballad include renditions by British folk rock act Steeleye Span which recorded two different versions for their 1974 album &quot;Now We Are Six&quot; and another for &quot;Present--The Very Best of Steeleye Span&quot;, released in 2002. Singer Ewan MacColl has also recorded his version of the ballad.
* The English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams left an opera by the title of &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; incomplete at the time of his death in 1958. The libretto was a collaboration between the composer and his second wife, Ursula Vaughan Williams, and it was based upon the ballads of &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; and &quot;Tam Lin&quot;.
* The British country/acid house band Alabama 3 drew upon the ballad of &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; in a 2003 recording entitled &quot;Yellow Rose&quot;. Alabama 3&#x27;s lyrics give the ballad a new setting in the American frontier of the 19th Century, where an enchanting woman lures the narrator to a night of wild debauchery, then robs and finally murders him. &quot;Yellow Rose&quot; appears on their 2003 album &quot;Power in the Blood&quot; (One Little Indian / Geffen).
* Kray Van Kirk&#x27;s Creative Commons-licensed song &quot;The Queen of Elfland&quot;, for which Van Kirk also created a music video, retells the story in a modern setting.

===Thomas in literature and theatre===
* Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Last Rhyme of True Thomas&quot; (1894) features Thomas Learmounth and a king who&#x27;s going to make Thomas his knight.
* John Geddie, &quot;Thomas the Rymour and his Rhymes&quot;. [With a portrait of the author], Edinburgh: Printed for the Rymour Club and issued from John Knox&#x27;s House, 1920.
* In William Croft Dickinson&#x27;s children book &quot;The Eildon Tree&quot; (1944), two modern children meeting Thomas the Rhymer and travel back in time to a critical point in Scottish history.
* Thomas is one of the main characters of Alexander Reid&#x27;s play &quot;The Lass wi the Muckle Mou&quot; (1950).
* Nigel Tranter, Scottish writer authored the novel &quot;True Thomas&quot; (1981).
* Ellen Kushner&#x27;s novel &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; (1990).
* Bruce Glassco&#x27;s short story &quot;True Thomas&quot;, in Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling&#x27;s anthology &quot;Black Swan, White Raven&quot; (1997). Like the other stories presented there, the Glassco story put a new spin on the legend. 
* &quot;Erceldoune&quot;, a novella by Richard Leigh (co-author of &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot;), features a folk-singer named Thomas &quot;Rafe&quot; Erlston. The novella appeared in the collection &quot;Erceldoune &amp; Other Stories&quot; (2006) 
* In Sergey Lukyanenko&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Last Watch&quot;, Thomas is described as having survived until today and currently occupies the post of the Head of the Scottish Night Watch.
* Thomas appears in John Leyland&#x27;s ballad &quot;Lord Soulis&quot;. Here, after failing to bind William II de Soules with magical ropes of sand, he determines that the sorcerer must be wrapped in lead and boiled.
* Thomas the Rhymer is a major character in Andrew James Greig&#x27;s novel &quot;One Is One&quot;, (2018), where Thomas is a man lost to himself and to time as he roams Scotland in the present day.
* Fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones&#x27; young adult novel &quot;Fire and Hemlock&quot; draws from the ballad in a story set in the present day.
* Patricia C. Wrede&#x27;s novel &quot;Snow White and Rose Red&quot; (1989), an adaptation of the fairy tale of the same name, casts the bear-prince and his brother as the Queen of Faerie&#x27;s sons by Thomas Learmont, and a condensed version of his legend is given as backstory; the brother uses the surname &quot;Rimer&quot; in his dealings with mortals.

===Representations in fine art===
* &quot;Thomas the Rhymer and the Queen of Faerie&quot; (1851), by Joseph Noel Paton illustrated the ballad. A print reproduction by Thomas the Rhymer and the Queen of Faerie by John Le Conte was published W &amp; A K Johnston (1852). 
* Beverly Nichols&#x27; &quot;A Book of Old Ballads&quot; (1934) reprinted the Greenwood version of the ballad, with a print of &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; by H. M. Brock

<text>The Great Ocean Road is an Australian National Heritage-listed stretch of road along the south-eastern coast of Australia, between the Victorian towns of Torquay and Allansford. Built by returned soldiers between 1919 and 1932, and dedicated to soldiers killed during World War I, the road is the world&#x27;s largest war memorial. Winding through varying terrain along the coast, and providing access to several prominent landmarks, including the Twelve Apostles limestone stack formations, the road is an important tourist attraction.

The city of Geelong, close to Torquay, experiences great benefit from Australian and international visitors to the road, with Geelong Otway Tourism affirming it as an invaluable asset. In 2008, the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) listed the road as the state&#x27;s top tourism experience in its &quot;Victoria 101 survey&quot;, based on places that members of the public would recommend to visitors.

==Route==
The Great Ocean Road starts at Torquay and runs westward to finish at Allansford, near Warrnambool. The road is two lanes (one in each direction), and has a speed limit which varies between 50 km/h and 100 km/h.

A prime tourist attraction, much of the road hugs the coastline along what is known, east of the Otway Ranges, as the Surf Coast and, west of Cape Otway, as the Shipwreck Coast. It provides extensive views over Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean.

The road runs through rainforests, as well as alongside beaches and cliffs composed of limestone and sandstone, which are susceptible to erosion. The road travels via Anglesea, Lorne, Apollo Bay, and Port Campbell, the latter being notable for its natural limestone and sandstone rock formations, including Loch Ard Gorge, The Grotto, London Bridge and The Twelve Apostles. The stretch of the Great Ocean Road nearer to Torquay closely follows the coast, with some sheer cliffs on the seaward side. Road signs warn motorists of possible rockfalls.

==History==
The Great Ocean Road was first planned towards the end of World War I, when chairman of the Country Roads Board, William Calder, asked the State War Council for funds to be provided for returned soldiers to work on roads in sparsely populated areas in the Western District. At the time, the rugged south-west coast of Victoria was accessible only by sea or rough bush track. It was envisaged that the road would connect isolated settlements on the coast, and become a vital transport link for the timber industry and tourism.

Surveying of the road, tentatively titled the &quot;South Coast Road&quot;, started in 1918. It was suggested that it run from Barwon Heads in the east, follow the coast west around Cape Otway, and end near Warrnambool. In 1918, the Great Ocean Road Trust was formed as a private company, under the helm of president Howard Hitchcock. The company managed to secure £81,000 in capital from private subscriptions and borrowing, with Hitchcock himself contributing £3000. The money was to be repaid by charging drivers a toll until the debt was cleared, and the road would then be gifted to the state.

===Construction===
Construction began on 19 September 1919. Approximately 3,000 returned servicemen worked on the project, which was a war memorial for servicemen killed in World War I. The advance survey team progressed through dense scrub at a rate of approximately three kilometres a month. Construction was mostly by hand, using explosives, pick and shovel, wheelbarrows, and some small machinery, and was at times perilous, with several workers being killed. The final sections, along steep coastal cliffs, were the most difficult to work on. Anecdotal evidence from ABC archives in 1982 suggested workers would rest detonators on their knees during travel, because it gave the explosives the softest ride.

Workers were paid 10 shillings and sixpence for an eight-hour day, also working a half-day on Saturdays. They were accommodated in tents, and were provided with meals in a communal dining marquee. Food cost up to 10 shillings a week. Despite the isolation of the camps, the workers had access to a piano, gramophone, games, newspapers and magazines.

In 1924, the coastal steamer &quot;Casino&quot; became stranded near Cape Patton, after having hit a reef at Point Hawdon, near the Grey River. Legend has it that 500 barrels of beer and 120 cases of spirits were jettisoned and that road workers salvaged them, resulting in an unscheduled two-week-long drinking break. However, Museums Victoria notes only that most of the cargo, largely composed of Christmas goods, was dumped into the sea. &quot;The Age&quot; reported that, &quot;The Great Ocean-road [sic] proved a boon to the passengers, who were enabled without much inconvenience to reach Wood&#x27;s farm house, Apollo Bay. However, if the road were finished, the vessel&#x27;s cargo could be safely conveyed to either Apollo Bay, the Wye River, or Lorne.&quot;
===Completion and early use===

On 18 March 1922, the section from Eastern View to Lorne was officially opened, with celebrations. However, it was then closed from 10 May 1922 for further work, opening again on 21 December, along with tolls to help recoup construction costs. The charge, payable at the Eastern View toll gate, was two shillings for motor cars, and 10 shillings for wagons with more than two horses.

In November 1932, the section from Lorne to Apollo Bay was finished, bringing the road to completion. It was officially opened by Victoria&#x27;s Lieutenant-Governor Sir William Irvine, during a ceremony near the Grand Pacific Hotel at Lorne, and the road has subsequently been acknowledged as the world&#x27;s largest war memorial. At the time, &quot;The Age&quot; commented, &quot;In the face of almost insurmountable odds, the Great Ocean Road has materialised from a dream or &#x27;wild-cat scheme&#x27;, as many dubbed it, into concrete reality&quot;. Although Hitchcock had died of heart disease on 22 August 1932, before the road was completed, his car was driven behind the governor&#x27;s in the procession along the road during the opening ceremony. A memorial in his name was constructed on the road at Mount Defiance, near Lorne, and he is generally considered to be the Father of the Road.

In its original state, the road was considered a formidable drive, comfortably accommodating only a single vehicle at a time. Areas with sheer cliffs were the most hazardous, with only few places where drivers could pull over to allow others to proceed in the opposite direction. For £5, any &quot;public-spirited citizen&quot; could request that a crossover be cut into the road. On 2 October 1936, the road was handed to the State Government, with the deed for the road being presented to the Victorian Premier at a ceremony at the Cathedral Rock toll gate. Tolls were removed at that time.

In 1939, following the death of the chairman of the Country Roads Board, W.T.B. McCormick, who was also honorary engineer for the Great Ocean Road Trust, it was decided to build a memorial arch in his honour, across the road at Eastern View. The arch was opened 4 November 1939, and was built of timber logs on a stone base, with a tablet memorial to Mr McCormick on one side, and another to the returned servicemen on the other. The arch was rebuilt in 1973, and again in 1983, after being destroyed in the Ash Wednesday bushfires.

In 1962, the Tourist Development Authority deemed the road to be &quot;one of the world&#x27;s great scenic roads&quot;. Despite improvements, the road was still considered a challenging drive, and the Victorian Police motor school was using it for training around 1966.

Over its life, the Great Ocean Road has been susceptible to natural elements. In 1960, the section at Princetown was partially washed away by water during storms. There were landslides on 11 August 1964, and 1971, both closing sections of the road near Lorne. Because of the terrain surrounding the road, it was also closed due to bushfires in 1962 and 1964, particularly in areas with nearby campsites. In January 2011, a section of a cutting collapsed due to heavy rain.

In 2011, the road was added to the Australian National Heritage List.

===Road classification===
Great Ocean Road was signed as State Route 100 between Torquay and Allansford in 1986; with Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, this was updated to route B100 in 1996.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Great Ocean Road (Arterial #4890), beginning at Surf Coast Highway at Torquay and ending at Princes Highway in Allansford.

===Great Ocean Walk===
In 2004, the Great Ocean Walk opened, connecting 104 km of walking trails that follow the coastline near the Great Ocean Road, stretching from Apollo Bay to the 12 Apostles.

== Engineering heritage award ==
The road received an Engineering Heritage National Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

== Great Ocean Road Protection Act==
In December 2020, the &quot;Great Ocean Road and Environs Protection Act 2020&quot; went into effect, giving legal protection to the Great Ocean Road.

==Events==
===Great Ocean Road Marathon===
A 45 kilometre section of the Great Ocean Road, between Lorne and Apollo Bay, is the location of the annual &quot;Great Ocean Road Marathon&quot;. First run in 2005, the marathon is part of the Great Ocean Road Running Festival. The course record of 2:27:37 was set in 2019 by English runner Nick Earl. Earl broke the previous record of 2:27:42 set in 2011 by James Kipkelwon of Kenya, who also won the event in 2012.

===Cycling===
In July 2015, former World Road Cycling Champion and Tour de France winner Cadel Evans announced that the Great Ocean Road would play host to the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race in early 2015, including elite races for men and women and a mass participation People&#x27;s Ride. As of 2019, the People&#x27;s Ride includes three distance options—35 km, 65 km, or 115 km.

Wiggle Amy&#x27;s Gran Fondo cycling event is held in September and uses the section between Lorne and Skenes Creek. One of the only cycling events in Australia held on a fully closed road, it is named for Amy Gillett, who was killed in a collision between the Australian women&#x27;s cycling squad and a driver in Germany in 2005.

Guangdong{{efn|{{IPAc-en|UK|g|w|æ|ŋ||ˈ|d|ʊ|ŋ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|g|w|ɑː|N|-}}; previously romanized as Kwangtung or Canton}} is a coastal province in South China, on the north shore of the South China Sea. The provincial capital is Guangzhou. With a population of 126.84{{nbsp}}million (as of 2021) across a total area of about {{convert|179,800|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, Guangdong is China&#x27;s most populous province and its 15th-largest by area, as well as the third-most populous country subdivision in the world.

Guangdong&#x27;s economy is the largest of any provincial-level division in China, with a GDP of 13.57 trillion RMB ($1.9 trillion in GDP nominal) in 2023, contributing approximately 10.6% of mainland China&#x27;s economic output. It has a diversified economy, and was known as the starting point of ancient China&#x27;s Maritime Silk Road. It is home to the production facilities and offices of a wide-ranging set of Chinese and foreign corporations. Guangdong has benefited from its proximity to the financial hub of Hong Kong, which it borders to the south. Guangdong also hosts the largest import and export fair in China, the Canton Fair, in Guangzhou. The Pearl River Delta Economic Zone, a Chinese megalopolis, is a core for high technology, manufacturing and foreign trade. In this zone are two of the four top Chinese cities and the top two Chinese prefecture-level cities by GDP: Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the first special economic zone in the country. These two are among China&#x27;s most populous and important cities, and have become two of the world&#x27;s most populous megacities and leading financial centres in the Asia-Pacific region.

Guangdong surpassed Henan and Shandong to become China&#x27;s most populous province in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 126,012,510 in the 2020 Chinese census, accounting for 8.93 percent of mainland China&#x27;s population. This makes it the most populous first-level administrative subdivision of any country outside South Asia. The vast majority of the historical Guangdong Province is administered by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). Pratas Island in the South China Sea is part of Cijin District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan (ROC); the island was part of Guangdong Province before the Chinese Civil War.

After the unification of Lingnan region during the Qin dynasty, immigrants from the Central Plains moved in and formed a local culture with a unique style. With the outward movement of the Guangdong people, the Hakka and Cantonese languages, music, cuisine, opera and tea ceremony have spread throughout the nation, Southeast Asia, and other countries. Guangdong was also the birthplace of the father of modern China and the founder of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. He declared a military government there in the Warlord Era. The two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau fall within the scope of Guangdong&#x27;s cultural influence, and its culture still has profound influences on the Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia, with the vast majority of the Chinese diaspora in the two countries claiming ancestry from Guangdong.

Guangdong is also one of the leading provinces in research and education in China. It hosts 160 institutions of higher education, ranking first in the South Central China region and second among all Chinese provinces/municipalities, after Jiangsu. As of 2023, two major cities in the province ranked in the world&#x27;s top 20 cities (Guangzhou 8th and Shenzhen 19th) by scientific research output.

== Name ==
&quot;Guǎng&quot; ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=廣|s=广}}) means &quot;wide&quot; or &quot;vast&quot;, and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in AD 226. The name &quot;Guang&quot; ultimately came from Guangxin ({{lang-zh|labels=no|first=t|t={{linktext|廣信}} |s=广信}}), an outpost established in Han dynasty near modern Wuzhou, whose name is a reference to an order by Emperor Wu of Han to &quot;widely bestow favors and sow trust&quot;. Together, Guangdong and Guangxi are called &quot;Loeng gwong&quot; ({{lang-zh|labels=no|first=t|t=兩廣|s=两广 |p=liǎng guǎng}}) During the Song dynasty, the Two Guangs were formally separated as &quot;Guǎngnán Dōnglù&quot; ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=廣南東路|s=广南东路|l=East Circuit in Southern Guang |labels=no}}) and &quot;Guǎngnán Xīlù&quot; ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=廣南西路|s=广南西路|l=West Circuit in Southern Guang |labels=no}}), which became abbreviated as &quot;Guǎngdōng Lù&quot; ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=廣東路|s=广东路 |labels=no}}) and &quot;Guǎngxī Lù&quot; ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=廣西路|s=广西路 |labels=no}}).

&quot;Canton&quot;, though etymologically derived from &quot;{{lang|pt|Cantão}}&quot; (the Portuguese transliteration of &quot;Guangdong&quot;), usually by itself refers to the provincial capital Guangzhou. Historically, Canton was also used for the province itself, but often either specified as a province (e.g. Canton Province), or written as &quot;Kwangtung&quot; in the Wade–Giles system and now most commonly as &quot;Guangdong&quot; in Pinyin. The local people of the city of Guangzhou (Canton) and their language are called Cantonese in English. Because of the prestige of Canton and its accent, Cantonese can also be used, in a wider sense, for the phylogenetically related residents and Chinese dialects outside the provincial capital.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

== History ==
===Prehistory===
The Neolithic era began in the Pearl River Delta ({{Lang|zh|珠江三角洲}}) 7,000 years before present (BP), with the early period from around 7000 to 5000 BP (c. 5050–3050 BC), and the late period from about 5000 to 3500 BP (c. 3050–1550 BC). In coastal Guangdong, the Neolithic was likely introduced from the middle Yangtze River area (Jiao 2013). In inland Guangdong, the neolithic appeared in Guangdong 4,600 years before present (BP). The Neolithic in northern inland Guangdong is represented by the Shixia culture ({{Lang|zh|石峽文化}}), which occurred from 4600 to 4200 BP (c. 2650–2250 BC).

===Imperial===
Originally inhabited by a mixture of tribal groups known to the Chinese as the Baiyue (&quot;Hundred Yue&quot;), the region first became part of China during the Qin dynasty. Under the Qin Dynasty, Chinese administration began and along with it, reliable historical records about the region. After establishing the first unified Chinese empire, the Qin expanded southwards and set up Nanhai Commandery at Panyu, near what is now part of Guangzhou. The region was later controlled by an independent kingdom known as Nanyue between the fall of Qin and the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. The Han dynasty administered Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam as Jiaozhi Province; southernmost Jiaozhi Province was used as a gateway for traders from the west—as far away as the Roman Empire. Under the Wu Kingdom of the Three Kingdoms period, Guangdong was made its own province, the Guang Province, in 226 CE.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Canton was a prosperous port city along a tropical frontier region beset by disease and wild animals, but rich in oranges, banyan, bananas, and lychee fruits. They traded slaves, silk and chinaware with Persians, Brahmans and Malays in exchange for their renowned medicines and fragrant tropical woods. Shi&#x27;a Muslims who had fled persecution in Khorasan and Buddhists from India lived side by side in the thriving town each erecting their own houses of worship. A foreign quarter sprang up along the river where many traders of diverse backgrounds including Arabs and Singhalese took up residence.

The port&#x27;s importance declined after it was raided by Arabs and Persians in 758 and the foreign residents were at times troubled by the corrupt local officials, sometimes responding violently. During one incident in 684, for example, a merchant vessel&#x27;s captain murdered a corrupt governor who had used his position to steal from the merchant.

Together with Guangxi, Guangdong was made part of Lingnan Circuit (political division Circuit), or Mountain-South Circuit, in 627 during the Tang dynasty. The Guangdong part of Lingnan Circuit was renamed Guangnan East Circuit ({{lang|zh-Hant|廣南東路}}) in 971 during the Song dynasty (960–1279). &quot;Guangnan East&quot; ({{Zh-no-labels|t=廣南東}}) is the source of the name &quot;Guangdong&quot; ({{Zh-no-labels|t=廣東|s=广东|first=t}}).{{Page reference|227}}

As time passed, the demographics of what is now Guangdong gradually shifted to (Han){{when|date=February 2020}} Chinese dominance as the populations intermingled due to commerce along the great canals. From the fall of the Han dynasty onwards, it shifted more abruptly through massive migration from the north during periods of political turmoil and nomadic incursions. For example, internal strife in northern China following the rebellion of An Lushan resulted in a 75% increase in the population of Guangzhou prefecture between the 740s–750s and 800s–810s. As more migrants arrived, the local population was gradually assimilated to Han Chinese culture or displaced.

As Mongols from the north engaged in their conquest of China in the 13th century, the Southern Song court fled southwards from its capital in Hangzhou. The defeat of the Southern Song court by Mongol naval forces in The Battle of Yamen 1279 in Guangdong marked the end of the Southern Song dynasty (960–1279).

During the Mongol Yuan dynasty, large parts of current Guangdong belonged to Jiangxi. Its present name, &quot;Guangdong Province&quot; was given in early Ming dynasty.

Since the 16th century, Guangdong has had extensive trade links with the rest of the world. European merchants coming northwards via the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea, particularly the Portuguese and British, traded extensively through Guangzhou. Macau, on the southern coast of Guangdong, was the first European settlement in 1557.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the 19th century, the opium traded through Guangzhou triggered the First Opium War, opening an era of Western imperialists&#x27; incursion and intervention in China. In addition to Macau, which was then a Portuguese colony, Hong Kong was ceded to the British, and Kouang-Tchéou-Wan (modern day area of Zhanjiang) to the French.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Due to the large number of people that emigrated out of the Guangdong province, and in particular the ease of immigration from Hong Kong to other parts of the British Empire (later British Commonwealth), many overseas Chinese communities have their origins in Guangdong and/or Cantonese culture. In particular, the Cantonese, Hakka, Teochew dialects have proportionately more speakers among overseas Chinese people than Mandarin-speaking Chinese. Additionally, many Taishanese-speaking Chinese emigrated to Western countries, with the results that many Western versions of Chinese words were derived from the Cantonese dialects rather than through the mainstream Mandarin language, such as &quot;dim sum&quot;. Some Mandarin Chinese words originally of foreign origin also came from the original foreign language by way of Cantonese. For example, the Mandarin word &quot;{{transliteration|zh|níngméng}}&quot; ({{lang-zh|s=柠檬|t=檸檬}}), meaning &quot;Lemon&quot;, came from Cantonese, in which the characters are pronounced as &quot;{{transliteration|zh|lìng mung}}&quot;. In the United States, there is a large number of Chinese who are descendants of immigrants from the county-level city of Taishan (Toisan in Cantonese), who speak a distinctive dialect related to Cantonese called Taishanese (or Toishanese).

During the 1850s, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, whose leader Hong Xiuquan was born in Guangdong and received a pamphlet from a Protestant Christian missionary in Guangdong, was allied with a local Guangdong Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856). Because of direct contact with the West, Guangdong was the centre of anti-Manchu and anti-imperialist activity. The generally acknowledged founder of modern China, Sun Yat-sen, was also from Guangdong.

===20th century===
During the early 1920s of the Republic of China, Guangdong was the staging area for the Kuomintang (KMT) to prepare for the Northern Expedition, an effort to bring the various warlords of China back under a unified central government. The Whampoa Military Academy was built near Guangzhou to train military commanders.

At the end of the Chinese Civil War Guangdong became one of the Nationalist government&#x27;s final footholds in Mainland China, with Guangzhou temporarily serving as the Kuomintang&#x27;s provisional capitol. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army seized control of the province after the retreat of the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan.

The new Chinese Communist Party administration issued harsh taxes, requisitioning between 22 and 60 percent of grain annually. However, the local party boss Fang Fang tried to moderate Chinese land reform policy in order to protect successful businesses in the Pearl River Delta, landholdings by overseas Chinese seeking to eventually return to the country, and commercial relations with British Hong Kong. In response Mao Zedong purged Fang and thousands of cadres from the province in 1952, sending Tao Zhu to implement a much harsher program under the slogan &quot;Every Village Bleeds, Every Household Fights.&quot;{{Sfn|Dikötter|2013|p=76–81}}

During Reform and Opening Up, Guangdong was supported by the central government to be &quot;one step ahead&quot; of the rest of the country.{{Rp|page=43}} Most major cities in Guangdong underwent liberalizing economic reforms in the mid-1980s.{{Rp|page=43}} Since Reform and Opening Up, the province has seen extremely rapid economic growth, aided in part by its close trading links with Hong Kong, which borders it. It is now the province with the highest gross domestic product in China.

In 1952, a small section of Guangdong&#x27;s coastline (Qinzhou, Lianzhou (now Hepu County), Fangchenggang and Beihai) was given to Guangxi, giving it access to the sea. This was reversed in 1955, and then restored in 1965. Hainan Island was originally part of Guangdong, but it was separated into its own province in 1988.

== Geography ==

Guangdong faces the South China Sea to the south and has a total of {{convert|4,300|km|abbr=on}} of coastline. The Leizhou Peninsula is on the southwestern end of the province. There are a few inactive volcanoes on Leizhou Peninsula. The Pearl River Delta is the convergent point of three upstream rivers: the East River, North River, and West River. The river delta is filled with hundreds of small islands. The province is geographically separated from the north by a few mountain ranges collectively called the Nan Mountains (Nan Ling). The highest peak in the province is Shikengkong with an elevation of {{convert|6,240|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level.

Guangdong borders Fujian to the northeast, Jiangxi and Hunan to the north, Guangxi autonomous region to the west, and Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions to the south. Hainan is offshore across from the Leizhou Peninsula. Pratas Island, which were traditionally governed as part of Guangdong, are part of Cijin District, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (ROC). The PRC continues to claim Pratas Island as part of Guangdong under the district of Chengqu, Shanwei.

Cities around the Pearl River Delta include Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, Shunde, Taishan, Zhongshan, and Zhuhai. Other cities in the province include Chaozhou, Chenghai, Nanhai, Shantou, Shaoguan, Zhanjiang, Zhaoqing, Yangjiang, and Yunfu.

Guangdong has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot; inland, &quot;Cwa&quot; along the coast). Winters are short, mild, and relatively dry, while summers are long, hot, and very wet. Average daily highs in Guangzhou in January and July are {{convert|18|and|33|°C|°F}}, although the humidity makes it feel hotter in summer. Frost is rare on the coast but may happen a few days each winter.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Guangdong}}

In 2022, Guangdong&#x27;s GDP was 13.57 trillion RMB ($1.9 trillion in GDP nominal, $3.78 trillion in PPP), with a per capita GDP of {{CNY|102,465}} ({{US$|15,234}} in nominal or US$25,016 in PPP). It is the richest province in South Central China region and the seventh richest among all provinces by GDP per capita. Guangdong has been the largest province by GDP since 1989 in Mainland China. Its GDP exceeded that of Australia ($1.70 trillion) and South Korea ($1.67 trillion), the world&#x27;s 12th and 13th largest economy, respectively. If it was a country, Guangdong would be the 12th-largest economy as of 2022 and the 11th most populous. Compared to country subdivisions in dollar terms, Guangdong&#x27;s GDP in nominal is larger than all but four country subdivisions: California, Texas, New York State, and England. Compared to country subdivisions in PPP terms, Guangdong&#x27;s GDP is larger than all, except California. By PPP terms, as of 2022, Guangdong&#x27;s economy ranked between Turkey and Italy with a GDP of $3.35 trillion and US$3.06 trillion respectively, the 11th and 12th largest in the world respectively.


After the communist revolution and until the start of the Deng Xiaoping reforms in 1978, Guangdong was an economic backwater, although a large underground, service-based economy has always existed. Economic development policies encouraged industrial development in the interior provinces which were weakly joined to Guangdong via transportation links. The government policy of economic autarky made Guangdong&#x27;s access to the ocean irrelevant.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s open door policy radically changed the economy of the province as it was able to take advantage of its access to the ocean, proximity to Hong Kong, and historical links to overseas Chinese. Guangdong was one of the first provinces to receive permission from the central government to receive foreign investment.{{Rp|page=148}} In addition, until the 1990s when the Chinese taxation system was reformed, the province benefited from the relatively low rate of taxation placed on it by the central government due to its post-Liberation status of being economically backward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Guangdong&#x27;s economic boom began with the early 1990s and has since spread to neighboring provinces, and also pulled their populations inward. The economic growth of Guangdong province owes much to the low-value-added manufacturing which characterized (and in many ways still defines) the province&#x27;s economy following Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reforms. Guangdong is not only China&#x27;s largest exporter of goods, it is the country&#x27;s largest importer as well.

The province is now one of the richest in the nation, with the most billionaires in mainland China, the highest GDP among all the provinces, although wage growth has only recently begun to rise due to a large influx of migrant workers from neighboring provinces. By 2015, the local government of Guangdong hopes that the service industry will account for more than 50 percent of the provinces GDP and high-tech manufacturing another 20 percent.

In 2021, Guangdong&#x27;s primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 534 billion RMB (US$79.4 billion), 5.28 trillion RMB (US$785.6 billion), and 7.09 trillion RMB (US$1.05 trillion), respectively. Guangdong contributes approximately 10.6% of the total national economic output. Now, it has three of the six Special Economic Zones: Shenzhen, Shantou and Zhuhai. The affluence of Guangdong, however, remains very concentrated near the Pearl River Delta.

Guangdong officially became the most populous province in 2005. Official statistics had traditionally placed Guangdong as the fourth-most populous province of China with about 80 million people, though an influx of migrants, temporary workers, and newly settled individuals numbered around 30 million. The massive influx of migrants from other provinces, dubbed the &quot;floating population&quot;, is due to Guangdong&#x27;s booming economy and high demand for labor. If Guangdong were an independent nation, it would rank among the twelfth largest countries of the world by population.

===Urbanization===

In 2021, Guangdong&#x27;s population is 74.6% urban and 25.4% rural.

===Genealogy===
Guangdong is the ancestral home of large numbers of overseas Chinese. Most of the railroad laborers in Canada, the Western United States and Panama in the 19th century came from Guangdong, especially the Siyi area. Many people from the region also traveled to California and other parts of the United States during the gold rush of 1849, and also to Australia during its gold rush a decade or so later.

===Languages and ethnicities===
The majority of the province&#x27;s population is Han Chinese, though the Han population is so diverse that the province has been called the &quot;treasure trove of regional languages&quot; ({{lang|zh|方言寶庫}}). Within the Han Chinese, the largest subgroup in Guangdong are the Cantonese people, with significant Hakka and Teoswa populations east of the Pearl River Delta. Guangdong is also home to small Mien, She, Hmong, Li, and Zhuang minorities.

====Yue Chinese====
{{main|Yue Chinese}}
Guangdong is the traditional heartland of Yue Chinese ({{lang-zh|t=粵語|s=粤语|p=yuèyǔ|j=jyut6 jyu5}}), which has a high degree of internal diversity. The vast majority of these speakers live at or west the Pearl River Delta. A total of {{sigfig|35810000|4}} Yue Chinese speakers live in Guangdong.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=160}}

Cantonese and other Yue varieties spoken at the delta such as Waitaunese and Shiqi Yue make up the greatest number of speakers, numbering at around {{sigfig|20720000|4}} speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} Due to the large overseas population and cultural impact of Cantopop and Cantonese television shows, Cantonese is a well-known variety of Chinese throughout the world.

Siyi or Szeyap Yue, including Hoisanese, is spoken in much of Jiangmen prefecture, numbering at around {{sigfig|3880000|3}} speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} Siyi was once the representative variety of Chinese in many Chinese American communities.

====Hakka Chinese====
{{main|Hakka Chinese}}
The highlands of the Jiangxi-Fujian-Guangdong tripoint are the traditional heartland of the Hakka Chinese ({{lang-zh|s=客家话|t=客家話|p=kèjiāhuà|j=haak3 gaa1 waa6-2}}; Moiyenese: &quot;hag5 ga1 fa4&quot;)-speaking people, and Meizhou is often dubbed the capital of Hakka culture. Downhill Hakka migrations started in the early modern period, and due to them being newcomers to the lowlands, they were dubbed &quot;guest families&quot; by the original inhabitants (the Puntis). There are around {{sigfig|20000000|4}} Neo-Hakka speakers in Guangdong, of which {{sigfig|2000000|3}} live significantly west of the traditional Hakka area.

====Min Chinese====
{{main|Teochew Min|Leizhou Min}}
Teoswa or Chaoshan Min ({{lang-zh|t=潮汕話|s=潮汕话|p=cháoshànhuà|j=ciu4 saan3 waa6-2}}; Peng&#x27;im: &quot;diê5 suan1 uê7&quot;) is spoken primarily in the Chaoshan area, that is to say, Chaozhou, Jieyang, Shantou, and Shanwei prefectures, by around {{sigfig|14120000|4}} speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} It is a Southern Min branch, but has little mutual intelligibility with Hokkien.

Leizhou Min ({{lang-zh|t=黎話|s=黎话|p=líhuà|j=leoi4 waa6-2}}; Leizhounese: [{{IPA|lɔi˨ ue˧˥}}]) is spoken primarily in the Leizhou peninsula of Zhanjiang prefecture by around {{sigfig|4510000|3}} speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} It is closely related to Hainanese.

====Other Chinese====
Around {{sigfig|500000|2}} speakers of Shaozhou Tuhua live in small communities in Shaoguan prefecture, typically surrounded by Hakka speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} These varieties have been observed to be similar to Hakka, and have been dubbed &quot;Paleo-Hakka&quot; by, for instance, W. South Coblin.

There are also around {{sigfig|40000|2}} Southwestern Mandarin speakers in Guangdong, with around half of them being remnants of Northern &quot;juntun&quot; [] that date back to the Ming dynasty. These communities largely live in small villages in coastal eastern Guangdong in places such as Haifeng and Huidong counties. The other half live in parts of Lechang close to Hunan province, which explains the Mandarin language they use.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}}

===Gender ratio===
Guangdong has a highly unbalanced gender ratio that is among the highest of all provinces in China. According to a 2009 study published in &quot;The British Medical Journal&quot;, in the 1–4 age group, there are over 130 boys for every 100 girls.

===Religion===
{{Pie chart

{{Main list|List of provincial leaders of the People&#x27;s Republic of China}}

Like all governing institutions in mainland China, Guangdong has a parallel party-government system, in which the CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee Secretary outranks the Governor. The CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and has control over the Guangdong Provincial People&#x27;s Government.

=== Law enforcement and emergency services ===
Provincial law enforcement in Guangdong is provided by the Guangdong Public Security Department. The {{Ill|People&#x27;s Armed Police Guangdong Corps|zh|中国人民武装警察部队广东省总队}} provides paramilitary law enforcement and disaster relief in the province while the {{Ill|Guangdong Fire and Rescue Corps|zh|广东省消防救援总队}} provides firefighting and rescue services in the province. 

The primary domestic intelligence and security agency in Guangdong is the Guangdong state security department. 

Corrections facilities in Guangdong are managed by the Guangdong Prison Administrative Bureau.

=== Dissent ===
According to Freedom House&#x27;s China Dissent Monitor, Guangdong accounted for 17% of dissent events in the first quarter of 2024 – over 100 events despite heavy Censorship in China. In 2024, Freedom House rated China as below zero on political rights (−2 out of 40).

=== Relations with Hong Kong and Macau ===
Hong Kong and Macau, while historically parts of Guangdong before becoming colonies of the United Kingdom and Portugal, respectively, are special administrative regions (SARs). Furthermore, the Basic Laws of both SARs explicitly forbid provincial governments from intervening in local politics. As a result, many issues with Hong Kong and Macau, such as border policy and water rights, have been settled by negotiations between the SARs&#x27; governments and the Guangdong provincial government.

== Media ==
Guangdong and the greater Guangzhou area are served by several Radio Guangdong stations, Guangdong Television, Southern Television Guangdong, Shenzhen Television, and Guangzhou Television. There is an English programme produced by Radio Guangdong which broadcasts information about this region to the entire world through the WRN Broadcast.

== Culture ==

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}

The central region, which is also the political and economic center, is populated predominantly by Yue Chinese speakers, though the influx in the last three decades of millions of Mandarin-speaking immigrants has slightly diminished Cantonese linguistic dominance. This region is associated with Cantonese cuisine. Dim Sum is one famous example of Cantonese cuisine, dividing Cantonese food into small portions and served with small dishes. Cantonese opera is a form of Chinese opera popular in Cantonese speaking areas. Related Yue dialects are spoken in most of the western half of the province.

The area comprising the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang in coastal east Guangdong, known as Chaoshan, forms its own cultural sphere. The Teochew people here, along with Hailufeng Min people in Shanwei, speak Hokkien, which is a Min dialect closely related to mainstream Southern Min (Hokkien) and their cuisine is Teochew cuisine. Teochew opera is also well-known and has a unique form.

The Hakka people live in large areas of Guangdong, including Huizhou, Meizhou, Shenzhen, Heyuan, Shaoguan and other areas. Much of the Eastern part of Guangdong is populated by the Hakka people except for the Chaozhou and Hailufeng area. Hakka culture include Hakka cuisine, Han opera ({{lang-zh|s=汉剧 |t=漢劇}}), Hakka &quot;Hanyue&quot; and &quot;sixian&quot; (traditional instrumental music) and Hakka folk songs ({{lang|zh|客家山歌}}).

The outcast Tanka people traditionally live on boats throughout the coasts and rivers of Guangdong and much of Southern China.

Zhanjiang in southern Guangdong is dominated by the Leizhou dialect, a variety of Minnan; Cantonese and Hakka are also spoken there.

Mandarin is the language used in education and government and in areas where there are migrants from other provinces, above all in Shenzhen. Cantonese maintains a strong and dominant position in common usage and media, even in eastern areas of the province where the local languages and dialects are non-Yue ones.

Guangdong Province is notable for being the birthplace of many famous Xiangqi (Chinese chess) grandmasters such as Lü Qin, Yang Guanli, Cai Furu and Xu Yinchuan.

== Education and research ==
As of 2022, Guangdong hosts 160 institutions of higher education, ranking first in South Central China region and 2nd among all Chinese provinces/municipalities after Jiangsu (168). Guangdong is also the seat of 14 adult higher education institutions. Many universities and colleges are located in major cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, hosts 83 institutions of higher education (excluding adult colleges), ranking 1st in South China region and 2nd (tie) nationwide after Beijing. Guangdong Province Department of Education is the department of the provincial government that oversees education.

As of 2023, two major cities in the province ranked in the top 20 cities in the world (Guangzhou 8th and Shenzhen 19th) by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index.

<text>Li Ao (, also spelled Lee Ao; 25 April 1935 – 18 March 2018) was a Chinese-Taiwanese writer, historian and independent politician. 

Li rose to prominence in the early 1960s through his articles in &quot;Wenxing&quot; (1957–1988), an intellectual Taiwanese magazine where he defended Hu Shih, criticized traditional Chinese culture, and advocated for complete Westernization, igniting a cultural debate over Chinese and Western ideologies. During the 1970s, he became active in the pro-democracy Tangwai movement, which resulted in two prison sentences as a political prisoner. 

After martial law was lifted in Taiwan in 1987, Li frequently ran for public office. In 2000, he ran for the presidency of Taiwan as the New Party candidate. From 2004 to 2008, he served as an independent legislator in the Legislative Yuan. After leaving office, Li focused on writing and teaching, and became a media personality hosting shows such as &quot;Li Ao Speaks His Mind&quot; (李敖有话说) and &quot;Li Ao&#x27;s Wit and Humor&quot; (李敖语妙天下).

Over his career, Li espoused liberalism, Chinese nationalist ideals, anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiments. A prominent critic of the Chiang family and the Kuomintang&#x27;s authoritarian rule in Taiwan, following the democratization in the late 1980s, he also criticized the Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwanese independence movement. In his later years, Li praised the Chinese Communist Party for revitalizing China but also condemned its authoritarianism.

==Early life and education==
Li was born in Harbin, Manchukuo to Li Dingyi (李鼎彝), a professor of Chinese, and Zhang Kuichen (). His family had ancestry in Wei County (modern-day Weifang), Shandong Province, and Fuyu County, Jilin Province. When Li was two years old, the family moved to Beijing, where Li&#x27;s father worked in the government&#x27;s opium suppression bureau.

There, Li&#x27;s father was accused of being a traitor to the Kuomintang by his superiors. Li then began feeling enmity towards the party. The entire Li family, except for two children, moved to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Li received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from National Taiwan University (NTU) in 1959. In 1963, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in history from NTU. As a graduate student, he was the executive editor of the magazine &quot;Wenxing&quot;.

==Dissident writer==
Li participated in the democratic movement in Taiwan between the 1960s and 1980s. In the 1960s, he was the editor-in-chief of &quot;Wenxing&quot; (文星), a magazine that promoted democracy and personal freedom.

He was jailed by the Kuomintang government from 1971 to 1976, for helping a pro-Taiwan independence legal scholar, Peng Ming-min, escape to Japan in 1970; even though Li himself had a long history of being an advocate of reunification. Li was also imprisoned from 1981 to 1982 over a dispute with a former employer.

Throughout the 1970s, Li received much international attention for his imprisonment. He was highlighted by Amnesty International as one of the three most important political prisoners in Taiwan in 1974.

After his release, Li continued to publish articles in magazines and newspapers, criticizing the Kuomintang government. Ninety-six of his books were banned in Taiwan until 1991. In the 1980s he also sponsored numerous anti-Kuomintang magazines.

His novel &quot;Mountaintop Love&quot; (), about a mother and a daughter who fall in love with the same man, though several years apart, established Li&#x27;s status as a prominent novelist. His novel &quot;Martyrs&#x27; Shrine: The Story of the Reform Movement of 1898 in China&quot; (北京法源寺), is about the beginning and the failure of the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform. Li also published his autobiography in 2001, revealing more than ten of his romantic affairs. However, the bulk of his work is non-fiction and consists mainly of essays and historical commentaries.

==Entry into politics==
Li participated in the presidential election in 2000 as a candidate for the New Party. Li usually played the role of a political gadfly, and his campaign was largely symbolic. He took the election as an opportunity to &quot;educate&quot; the people of Taiwan. Both Li and his party publicly encouraged people to vote for James Soong. During the presidential debates, Li even stated that he was not planning to vote for himself and that people should vote for Soong.

Since the 2000 presidential election, Li had bitterly spoken out against pro-independence Nobel laureate Yuan T. Lee, who publicly supported Chen Shui-bian. He also accused former President Lee Teng-hui of corruption. In October 2004, Li ran in the December 11 legislative election as a non-partisan candidate of the South Taipei constituency, and was subsequently elected to be the last winning place. He took office as an independent legislator on 1 February 2005.

In February 2005, Li held a press conference, accusing the PFP leader, James Soong of having changed his opposition towards military weapons purchase from the United States under the influence of people of pro-American inclination, people with CIA backgrounds and arms traders who would receive kick-backs. Li threatened Soong that he would reveal the names of the people with CIA backgrounds, who were influencing Soong, to the general public unless Soong reverted to his previous opposition position. PFP legislators dismissed the accusation and responded that Li Ao should reveal his evidence to support his story.

Later that year, in June, Li claimed to the Taiwanese press that he had exclusive information from the CIA concerning the 3-19 shooting incident. He alleged that the real motive of the killer was to assassinate the Vice-President Annette Lu in order to garner sympathy votes for Chen Shui-bian, and that the killer had been condoned by the governing party for ulterior political reasons. After flashing several allegedly CIA-endorsed documents to reporters, he mailed them to Annette Lu, claiming that she needed to know the truth about the assassination attempt to the full extent.

On 19 September 2005, Li returned to Mainland China for the first time in 56 years. He was invited to give speeches at Peking University, Tsinghua University and Fudan University where he was warmly received, and the trip was claimed to have had significant impact on observers of Cross-Strait relations.

Li was a candidate for the 2006 Taipei Mayoral election, and a candidate for the 2012 Legislative Yuan elections, campaigning in Taipei City District 8 under the People First Party (PFP) banner. Li also satirized Mao Zedong&#x27;s Little Red Book in his article.

On 24 October 2006, Li sprayed tear gas and wielded a stun gun during a Legislative Yuan National Defense Committee meeting, forcing several members of the parliament to flee. He was attempting to stop debate on purchasing attack submarines and Patriot anti-aircraft missiles for $16 billion from the U.S. He was also wearing the Guy Fawkes mask from &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;.

==Personal life==
Li has a reputation of a womanizer. In the early 1960s, Li cohabited with Wang Shangqin, a National Taiwan University student and the younger sister of the writer Wang Shangyi. In 1964, Wang went to the United States for study, only to discover that she was pregnant with Li’s child. She gave birth to their daughter, Hedy W. Lee, out of wedlock in Seattle. However, during Wang Shangqin’s pregnancy, Li Ao became romantically involved with another woman, Wu Haidi. In 1966, Wang brought their daughter to Taiwan and briefly reconciled with Li, but their relationship ultimately ended due to his involvement with multiple other women. Wang has acrimonious relationships with both Li and their daughter Lee thereafter. After she returned to the US from Taiwan, she remarried Wen Naijian, an engineer. Lee, in a book published in 2004, accused Wen, her stepfather, of molesting her when she was 14, which Wang denied.

On 6 May 1980, Li married Taiwanese actress Terry Hu. Their love story even featured in &quot;Time&quot;. The couple divorced on 28 August 1980, after 115 days in total.

On 8 March 1992, Li married his second wife, Wang Zhihui (王志慧). They had one son and one daughter. Their son, Li Kan (李戡), graduated with a BA degree in history from Peking University and is a PhD student in Chinese Studies at University of Cambridge .

<text>Poplog is a reflective, incrementally compiled software development computer programming integrated development environment and system platform for the programming languages POP-11, Common Lisp, Prolog, and Standard ML. It was created originally in the United Kingdom for teaching and research in artificial intelligence, at the University of Sussex, and later marketed as a commercial package for software development, teaching, and research. It was one of the initiatives supported for a time by the UK government-funded Alvey Programme.

It was licensed originally from 1982 to 1999, as proprietary software, then released in 1999 as open-source software, under a mix of MIT and then XFree86 licenses.

==History==
After an incremental compiler for Prolog had been added to an implementation of POP-11, the name POPLOG was adopted, to reflect that the expanded system supported programming in both languages. The name was retained, as a trade mark of the University of Sussex, when the system was later (mid 1980s) extended with incremental compilers for Common Lisp and Standard ML based on a set of tools for implementing new languages in the Poplog Virtual Machine. The user-accessible incremental-compiler tools that allow compilers for all these languages to be added also allow extensions to be made within a language to provide new abilities that cannot be added via standard macros that merely allow new text to be equivalent to a longer portion of old text.

For some time after 1983, Poplog was sold and supported internationally as a commercial product, on behalf of the University of Sussex by Systems Designers Ltd (SDL), whose name changed as ownership changed. The main development work continued to be done by a small team at Sussex University until 1998, while marketing, sales, and support (except for UK academic users, who dealt directly with the Sussex team) was done by SDL and its successors (SD, then SD-Scicon then Electronic Data Systems (EDS)) until 1991. At that time a management buy-out produced a spin-off company Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL), to sell and support Poplog in collaboration with Sussex University, who retained the rights to the name &#x27;Poplog&#x27; and were responsible for the core software development while it was a commercial product. In 1992 ISL and Sussex University won a &quot;Smart Award&quot; in recognition of Poplog sales worth $5M.
ISL and its clients used Poplog for many development projects, especially ISL&#x27;s data-mining system Clementine, mostly implemented in POP-11, using powerful graphical tools implemented also in POP-11 running on the X Window System. Clementine was so successful that in 1998 ISL was bought by SPSS Inc who had been selling the statistics and data-mining package SPSS for which they needed a better graphical interface suited to expert and non-expert users. SPSS did not wish to sell and support Poplog as such, so Poplog then became available as a free open source software package, hosted at the University of Birmingham, which had also been involved in development after 1991. Later IBM bought SPSS and Clementine is now marketed and supported as SPSS Modeler.

==Supported languages==
Poplog&#x27;s core language is POP-11. It is used to implement the other languages, all of them incrementally compiled, with an integrated common editor. In the Linux/Unix versions, POP-11 provides support for 2-D graphics via X.

Poplog supports incrementally compiled versions of Common Lisp, POP-11, Prolog, and Standard ML. A separate package implemented by Robin Popplestone supports a version of Scheme.

Poplog has been used both for academic research and teaching in artificial intelligence and also to develop several commercial products, apart from Clementine. In 1992, ISL and Sussex University won an ICP Million Dollar award in recognition of Poplog exceeding sales of US$5 million.

==Platforms==
POP-11 was at first implemented on a DEC PDP-11 computer in 1976, and was ported to VAX/VMS in 1980. It became Poplog around 1982. Although the first commercial sales were for VAX/VMS, from the mid-1980s, the main Poplog development work was done on Sun SPARC computers running Solaris, although several different versions were sold, including versions for HP-UX and a 64-bit version of Poplog for DEC Alpha running Digital UNIX. After about 1999, when Poplog became available as free, open source, most development work was done on the Linux version, including porting to 64-bit Linux. A partial port to Mac OS X on PowerPC was done in 2005.

There is a version for Windows, originally developed to support Clementine, but the Unix/Linux graphical subsystem does not work on Windows Poplog. The Windows version of Clementine depended on a commercial package that supported X functionality on Windows.

There is also an open source project which aimed to produce a more platform neutral version of Poplog, including Windows. The most recent development by this project includes a web server component for integrating into Poplog applications, and the OpenPoplog Widget Collection for supporting client user interfaces running in a web browser. A more narrowly focused open source Poplog project, restricted to the 64-bit AMD64/X86-64 architecture was set up on GitHub by Waldek Hebisch: . This is now the basis of Poplog Version 16 hosted at the University of Birmingham .

Additional information about the history and features of Poplog can be found in the entries for POP-2 and POP-11. The chief architect of Poplog, responsible for many innovations related to making an incrementally compiled system portable, and providing support for a collection of languages was John Gibson, at Sussex University, though the earliest work was done by Steve Hardy. Chris Mellish helped with the initial Prolog implementation in POP-11. John Williams, working under supervision of Jonathan Cunningham implemented the Common Lisp subsystem. Robert Duncan and Simon Nichols added Standard ML. Between about 1980 and 1991, the project was managed by Aaron Sloman, until he went to the University of Birmingham, though he continued to collaborate with Sussex and ISL on Poplog development after that. Since 1999, he has been responsible for the main Poplog web site, as well as some of the extensions to be found there, listed under POP-11.

==Implementation==
The Prolog subset of Poplog is implemented using the extendable incremental compiler of POP-11, the core language of Poplog, which is a general purpose Lisp-like language with a more conventional syntax. The implementation required the Poplog Virtual Machine to be extended to provide support for Prolog continuations, Prolog variables, the Prolog &quot;trail&quot; (recording undoable variable bindings), and Prolog terms. The implementation was constrained by the need to allow data-structures to be shared with the other Poplog languages, especially POP-11 and Common Lisp, thereby providing support for a mixture of programming styles.

<doc id="65119" wikidata="Q9333" url="?curid=65119" title="Laozi">
<text>Laozi (), also romanized as Lao Tzu among other ways, was a semi-legendary Chinese philosopher and author of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; (&quot;Laozi&quot;), one of the foundational texts of Taoism alongside the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. The name, literally meaning &#x27;Old Master&#x27;, was likely intended to portray an archaic anonymity that could converse with Confucianism. Modern scholarship generally regards his biographical details as later inventions, and his opus a collaboration. Traditional accounts addend him as , born in the 6th-centuryBC state of Chu during China&#x27;s Spring and Autumn period (). Serving as the royal archivist for the Zhou court at Wangcheng (modern Luoyang), he met and impressed Confucius () on one occasion, composing the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; in a single session before retiring into the western wilderness.

A central figure in Chinese culture, Laozi is generally considered the founder of Taoism. He was claimed and revered as the ancestor of the Tang dynasty (618–907) and is similarly honored in modern China as the progenitor of the popular surname Li. In some sects of Taoism, Chinese Buddhism, Confucianism, and Chinese folk religion, it is held that he then became an immortal hermit. Certain Taoist devotees held that the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; was the avatarembodied as a bookof the god Laojun, one of the Three Pure Ones of the Taoist pantheon, though few philosophers believe this. 

The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; had a profound influence on Chinese religious movements and on subsequent Chinese philosophers, who annotated, commended, and criticized the texts extensively. In the 20th century, textual criticism by historians led to theories questioning Laozi&#x27;s timing or even existence, positing that the received text of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; was not composed until the Warring States period (221 BC), and was the product of multiple authors.

== Name ==
Laozi () is the modern pinyin romanization of . It is not a personal name, but rather an honorific title, meaning &#x27;old&#x27; or &#x27;venerable&#x27;. Its structure matches that of other ancient Chinese philosophers, such as Kongzi, Mengzi, and Zhuangzi. 

Traditional accounts give Laozi the personal name Li Er (, ), whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as . Li is a common Chinese surname which also has the meaning meaning &#x27;plum&#x27; or &#x27;plum tree&#x27; when used as a common noun; there is a legend tying Laozi&#x27;s birth to a plum tree. Laozi has long been identified with the persona Lao Dan (, ). &quot;Dan&quot; similarly means &quot;Long-Ear&quot; or &quot;the Long-Eared One&quot;. The character is the Chinese word for &#x27;ear&#x27;. 

Laozi is recorded bearing the courtesy name Boyang (, ), whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as . The character was the title of the eldest son born to the primary wife, or an uncle of the father&#x27;s family who was older than one&#x27;s father, also used as a noble title indicating an aristocratic lineage head with rulership over a small to medium domain, and as a general mark of respect. The character is yang, the solar and masculine life force in Taoist belief. Lao Dan seems to have been used more generally, however, including by Sima Qian in his &quot;Shiji&quot; (), in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, and by some modern scholars.

== Identity ==
By the mid-twentieth century, consensus had emerged among Western scholars that the historicity of a person known as Laozi is doubtful and that the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; is &quot;a compilation of Taoist sayings by many hands&quot;, with an author being invented afterwards. While multiple authorship over time is typical for early Chinese texts, the book&#x27;s conspicuous absence of a central Master figure place it in marked contrast with nearly all other early Chinese philosophical works.

, the oldest manuscript containing text from the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; dates to the late 4th century BC, written on bamboo slips excavated as part of the Guodian Chu Slips. These passages correspond with roughly one third of the received text, and some are placed in the same order. These are mixed in with passages not carried by the transmitted &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, indicating that its makeup was still undergoing revisions and modifications. The oldest manuscripts of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; in a complete form by itself were discovered at a tomb in Mawangdui, and date to the early 2nd century BC. Analysis of early commentary on passages that appear in the received &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; supports an accretionary evolution for the text rather than a singular authorship event.

=== Traditional accounts ===
The earliest biographical reference to Laozi is found in the 1st‑century BC &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by Sima Qian. Multiple accounts of Laozi&#x27;s biography are presented, with Sima Qian expressing various levels of doubt in his sources. 

In one account, Sima Qian reports that Laozi was said to be a contemporary of Confucius during the 6th or 5th centuryBC. His personal name was Er or Dan. He was born in the village of Quren (, &quot;Qūrén lǐ&quot;) in the southern state of Chu, within present-day Luyi in Henan. He was said to be the son of the Censor-in-Chief of the Zhou dynasty and Lady Yishou (), and was a scholar who worked as the Keeper of the Archives for the royal Zhou court. This reportedly allowed him broad access to the works of the Yellow Emperor and other classics of the time, and he wrote a book in two parts before departing to the west.

In another, Laozi was a different contemporary of Confucius called (), one of the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars, and wrote a book in 15 parts. The story tells of Zong the Warrior who defeats an enemy and triumphs, and then abandons the corpses of the enemy soldiers to be eaten by vultures. By coincidence Laozi, traveling and teaching the way of the Tao, comes on the scene and is revealed to be the father of Zong, from whom he was separated in childhood. Laozi tells his son that it is better to treat respectfully a beaten enemy, and that the disrespect to their dead would cause his foes to seek revenge. Convinced, Zong orders his soldiers to bury the enemy dead. Funeral mourning is held for the dead of both parties and a lasting peace is made.

In a third, he was the court astrologer Lao Dan who lived during the 4th centuryBC reign of the Duke Xian of Qin who grew weary of the moral decay of life in Chengzhou and noted the kingdom&#x27;s decline. He ventured west to live as a hermit in the unsettled frontier at the age of 80. At the western gate of the city (or kingdom), he was recognized by the guard Yinxi. The sentry asked the old master to record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass. The text Laozi wrote was said to be the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, although the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, the sentry was so touched by the work that he became a disciple and left with Laozi, never to be seen again. In some later interpretations, the &quot;Old Master&quot; journeyed all the way to India and was the teacher of Siddartha Gautama, the Buddha. Others say he was the Buddha himself.

The stories assert that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students and loyal disciples. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. A.C. Graham suggested that the Confucian version of the story presented in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; was the original, which was borrowed and re-interpreted by the followers of Zhuang Zhou. His birthday is popularly held to be the 15th day of the second month of the Chinese calendar. In accounts where Laozi married, he was said to have had a son who became a celebrated soldier of Wei during the Warring States period.

== &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; ==


The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; is one of the most significant treatises in Chinese cosmogony. It is often called the &quot;Laozi&quot;, and has always been associated with that name. The identity of the person or people who wrote or compiled the text has been the source of considerable speculation and debate throughout history. As with many works of ancient Chinese philosophy, ideas are often explained by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; stands as an exemplar of this literary form. Unlike most works of its genre, the book conspicuously lacks a central &quot;master&quot; character and seldom references historical people or events, giving it an air of timelessness.

&lt;section begin=&quot;DDJ themes&quot; /&gt;The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; describes the Tao as the source and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, but not transcendent, immensely powerful yet supremely humble, being the root of all things. People have desires and free will (and thus are able to alter their own nature). Many act &quot;unnaturally&quot;, upsetting the natural balance of the Tao. The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; intends to lead students to a &quot;return&quot; to their natural state, in harmony with Tao. Language and conventional wisdom are critically assessed. Taoism views them as inherently biased and artificial, widely using paradoxes to sharpen the point.

&quot;Wu wei&quot;, literally &#x27;non-action&#x27; or &#x27;not acting&#x27;, is a central concept of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. The concept of &quot;wu wei&quot; is multifaceted, and reflected in the words&#x27; multiple meanings, even in English translation; it can mean &quot;not doing anything&quot;, &quot;not forcing&quot;, &quot;not acting&quot; in the theatrical sense, &quot;creating nothingness&quot;, &quot;acting spontaneously&quot;, and &quot;flowing with the moment&quot;.

This concept is used to explain &quot;ziran&quot;, or harmony with the Tao. It includes the concepts that value distinctions are ideological and seeing ambition of all sorts as originating from the same source. &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; used the term broadly with simplicity and humility as key virtues, often in contrast to selfish action. On a political level, it means avoiding such circumstances as war, harsh laws and heavy taxes. Some Taoists see a connection between &quot;wu wei&quot; and esoteric practices, such as &quot;zuowang&quot; (&#x27;sitting in oblivion&#x27;: emptying the mind of bodily awareness and thought) found in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;.&lt;section end=&quot;DDJ themes&quot; /&gt;

Alan Chan provides an example of how Laozi encouraged a change in approach, or return to &quot;nature&quot;, rather than action. Technology may bring about a false sense of progress. The answer provided by Laozi is not the rejection of technology, but instead seeking the calm state of &quot;wu wei&quot;, free from desires. This relates to many statements by Laozi encouraging rulers to keep their people in &quot;ignorance&quot;, or &quot;simple-minded&quot;. Some scholars insist this explanation ignores the religious context, and others question it as an apologetic of the philosophical coherence of the text. It would not be unusual political advice if Laozi literally intended to tell rulers to keep their people ignorant. However, some terms in the text, such as &quot;valley spirit&quot; (, &quot;gǔshén&quot;) and &#x27;soul&#x27; (, &quot;pò&quot;), bear a metaphysical context and cannot be easily reconciled with a purely ethical reading of the work.

== Influence ==

Potential officials throughout Chinese history drew on the authority of non-Confucian sages, especially Laozi and Zhuangzi, to deny serving any ruler at any time. Zhuangzi, the other founder of Taoism, had a great deal of influence on Chinese literati and culture. Political theorists influenced by Laozi have advocated humility in leadership and a restrained approach to statecraft, either for ethical and pacifist reasons, or for tactical ends. In a different context, various antiauthoritarian movements have embraced Laozi&#x27;s teachings on the power of the weak.

=== Han dynasty ===
The story of Laozi has taken on strong religious overtones since the Han dynasty. As Taoism took root, Laozi was worshipped as a god. Belief in the revelation of the Tao from the divine Laozi resulted in the formation of the Way of the Celestial Masters, the first organized religious Taoist sect. In later Taoist tradition, Laozi came to be seen as a personification of the Tao. He is said to have undergone numerous &quot;transformations&quot; and taken on guises in various incarnations throughout history to initiate the faithful in the Way. Religious Taoism often holds that the &quot;Old Master&quot; did not disappear after writing the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; but rather spent his life traveling and revealing the Tao.

Taoist myths state that Laozi was a virgin birth, conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He supposedly remained in her womb for 62 years before being born while his mother was leaning against a plum tree. Laozi was said to have emerged as a grown man with a full grey beard and long earlobes, both symbols of wisdom and long life. Other myths state that he was reborn 13 times after his first life during the days of Fuxi. In his last incarnation as Laozi, he lived 990 years and spent his life traveling to reveal the Tao.

=== Tang dynasty ===
Due to his traditional name &quot;Li Er&quot;, Laozi has been venerated as the ancestor of all subsequent Lis, and many clans of the Li family trace their descent to Laozi, including the emperors of the Tang dynasty. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (). According to the Simpkinses, while many (if not all) of these lineages are questionable, they provide a testament to Laozi&#x27;s impact on Chinese culture. Under the Tang, Laozi received a series of temple names of increasing grandeur. In the year 666, Emperor Gaozong named Laozi the &quot;Supremely Mysterious and Primordial Emperor&quot; &quot;Tàishàng Xuán Yuán Huángdì&quot;). In 743, Emperor Xuanzong declared him the &quot;Sage Ancestor&quot; &quot;Shèngzǔ&quot;) of the dynasty with the posthumous title of &quot;Mysterious and Primordial Emperor&quot; &quot;Xuán Yuán Huángdì&quot;). Emperor Xuanzong also elevated Laozi&#x27;s parents to the ranks of &quot;Innately Supreme Emperor&quot; &quot;Xiāntiān Tàishàng Huáng&quot;) and &quot;Innate Empress&quot; &quot;Xiāntiān Tàihòu&quot;). In 749, Laozi was further honored as the &quot;Sage Ancestor and Mysterious and Primordial Emperor of the Great Way&quot; &quot;Shèngzǔ Dàdào Xuán Yuán Huángdì&quot;) and then, in 754, as the &quot;Great Sage Ancestor and Mysterious and Primordial Heavenly Emperor and Great Sovereign of the Golden Palace of the High and Supreme Great Way&quot; &quot;Dà Shèngzǔ Gāo Shǎng Dàdào Jīnquē Xuán Yuán Tiānhuáng Dàdì&quot;).

A seventh-century work, the &quot;Sandong Zhunang&quot; (; &quot;Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns&quot;), presents Laozi is the perfect Taoist master and a character named Yinxi as the ideal Taoist student. Yinxi follows a formal sequence of preparation, testing, training and attainment.

=== Tamil Nadu ===
In the Siddhar tradition of Tamil Nadu, the greatly revered Siddhar Bhogar, one of the 18 esteemed Siddhars of yore, is believed to be Laozi and is of Chinese origin. His caste, from obscure references is noted to be &quot;Cinatecakkuyavar&quot; or Chinese potter. In his principal book of poetry, the &quot;Bhogar 7000&quot;, he tells of his travels to China to spread his ideas on spirituality, specifically on the topic of sublimating the sexual energies and using said energies to become self-realised, with a spiritually-minded partner. His Jeeva Samadhi can be found in the southwestern corridor of the Dhandayuthapani Temple, Palani, Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu.

=== Contemporary ===
Many contemporary philosophers have seen Laozi as a proponent of limited government. The right-libertarian economist Murray Rothbard suggested that Laozi was the first libertarian, likening Laozi&#x27;s ideas on government to Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s theory of spontaneous order. James A. Dorn agreed, writing that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, &quot;argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony.&quot; Similarly, the Cato Institute&#x27;s David Boaz includes passages from the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; in his 1997 book &quot;The Libertarian Reader&quot; and noted in an article for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; that Laozi advocated for rulers to &quot;do nothing&quot; because &quot;without law or compulsion, men would dwell in harmony.&quot; Philosopher Roderick Long argues that libertarian themes in Taoist thought are actually borrowed from earlier Confucian writers.

The anarcho-syndicalist writer and activist Rudolf Rocker praised Laozi&#x27;s &quot;gentle wisdom&quot; and understanding of the opposition between political power and the cultural activities of the people and community in his 1937 book &quot;Nationalism and Culture&quot;. In his 1910 article for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Peter Kropotkin also noted that Laozi was among the earliest proponents of essentially anarchist concepts. More recently, anarchists such as John P. Clark and Ursula K. Le Guin have written about the conjunction between anarchism and Taoism in various ways, highlighting the teachings of Laozi in particular. In her rendition of the Tao Te Ching, Le Guin writes that Laozi &quot;does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped... He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anyone who follows the Way. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends.&quot;

<text>The People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) is a major conservative political party of the centre-right in Singapore. It is one of the three contemporary political parties represented in the Parliament of Singapore, alongside the opposition Workers&#x27; Party (WP) and the Progress Singapore Party (PSP).

Initially founded as a traditional centre-left party in 1954, the leftist faction was soon expelled in 1961 by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in the midst of Singapore&#x27;s merger with Malaysia, desiring to move the party&#x27;s ideology towards the centre after its first electoral victory in 1959. Beginning in the 1960s, the party began to move towards the centre-right. Following the 1965 agreement which led to Singapore&#x27;s independence from Malaysia, the entire opposition boycotted the general elections in 1968, except for the Worker&#x27;s Party, which won no seats in the election. For decades thereafter, the PAP exercised exclusivity over its governance of national institutions and become the largest political party in the country.

From 1965 to 1981, the PAP was the only political force represented in Parliament until it saw its first electoral defeat to the WP at a by-election in the constituency of Anson. Nevertheless, the PAP has not seen its hegemony threatened and has always received over 60% of the votes and 80% of the seats in every subsequent general election. Having governed for years, the PAP is the longest uninterrupted governing party among modern multiparty parliamentary democracies. It is the second-longest governing party in history after Mexico&#x27;s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which led for 71 years from 1929 to 2000.

Positioned on the centre-right of Singapore politics, the PAP is ideologically socially conservative and economically liberal. The party generally favours free-market economic policies, having turned Singapore&#x27;s economy into one of the world&#x27;s freest and most open, but has at times engaged in state interventionism reminiscent of welfarism. The party has supported the creation of state-owned enterprises, known locally as government-linked corporations. This was done in order to jumpstart industrialisation, spearhead economic development and lead to economic growth, primarily job creation, in various sectors of the Singaporean economy. Socially, the PAP supports communitarianism and civic nationalism. The cohesion of the country&#x27;s main ethnic groups into a single Singaporean national identity forms the basis of many of its social policies. On foreign policy, it favours maintaining a strong and robust military, serving as a purportedly indispensable guarantor of the country&#x27;s continued sovereignty within the context of its strategic position for international finance and trade.

== History ==

Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee were involved in the Malayan Forum, a London-based student activist group that was against colonial rule in Malaya in the 1940s and early 1950s. Upon returning to Singapore, the group met regularly to discuss approaches to attain independence in Malayan territories and started looking for like-minded individuals to start a political party. Journalist S. Rajaratnam was introduced to Lee by Goh. Lee was also introduced to several English-educated left-wing students and Chinese-educated union and student leaders while working on the Fajar sedition trial and the National Service riot case.

===Formation===
The PAP was officially registered as a political party on 21 November 1954. Convenors of the party include a group of trade unionists, lawyers and journalists such as Lee Kuan Yew, Abdul Samad Ismail, Toh Chin Chye, Devan Nair, S. Rajaratnam, Chan Chiaw Thor, Fong Swee Suan, Tann Wee Keng and Tann Wee Tiong. The political party was led by Lee Kuan Yew as its secretary-general, with Toh Chin Chye as its founding chairman. Other party officers include Tann Wee Tiong, Lee Gek Seng, Ong Eng Guan and Tann Wee Keng.

The PAP first contested the 1955 general election in which 25 of 32 seats in the legislature were up for election. In this election, the PAP&#x27;s four candidates gained much support from the trade union members and student groups such as the University Socialist Club, who canvassed for them. The party won three seats, one by its leader Lee Kuan Yew for the Tanjong Pagar division and one by PAP co-founder Lim Chin Siong for the Bukit Timah division. Then 22 years old unionist Lim Chin Siong was and remained the youngest Assemblyman ever to be elected to office. The election was won by the Labour Front headed by David Marshall.

In April 1956, Lim and Lee represented the PAP at the London Constitutional Talks along with Chief Minister David Marshall which ended in failure as the British declined to grant Singapore internal self-government. On 7 June 1956, Marshall, disappointed with the constitutional talks, stepped down as Chief Minister as he had pledged to do so earlier if self-governance was not achieved. He was replaced by Lim Yew Hock, another Labour Front member. Lim pursued a largely anti-communist campaign and managed to convince the British to make a definite plan for self-government. The Constitution of Singapore was revised accordingly in 1958, replacing the Rendel Constitution with one that granted Singapore self-government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its Legislative Assembly.

PAP and left-wing members who were communists were criticised for inciting riots in the mid-1950s. Lim Chin Siong, Fong Swee Suan and Devan Nair as well as several unionists were detained by the police after the Chinese middle schools riots. Lim Chin Siong was placed under solitary confinement for close to a year, away from his other PAP colleagues, as they were placed in the Medium Security Prison (MSP) instead. The number of PAP members imprisoned rose in August 1957, when PAP members from the trade unions (viewed as &quot;communist or pro-communist&quot;) won half the seats in the Central Executive Committee (CEC). The &quot;moderate&quot; CEC members, including Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and others, refused to take their appointments in the CEC. Yew Hock&#x27;s government again made a sweeping round of arrests, imprisoning all the &quot;communist&quot; members, before the &quot;moderates&quot; re-assumed their office.

Following this, the PAP decided to re-assert ties with the labour faction of Singapore in the hope of securing the votes of working-class Chinese Singaporeans, many of whom were supporters of the jailed unionists. Lee Kuan Yew convinced the incarcerated union leaders to sign documents to state their support for the party and its policies, promising to release the jailed members of the PAP when the party came to power in the next elections. Ex-Barisan Sosialis member Tan Jing Quee claims that Lee was secretly in collusion with the British to stop Lim Chin Siong and the labour supporters from attaining power because of their huge popularity. Quee also states that Lim Yew Hock deliberately provoked the students into rioting and then had the labour leaders arrested. Greg Poulgrain of Griffiths University argued that &quot;Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock in urging the Colonial Secretary to impose the subversives ban in making it illegal for former political detainees to stand for election&quot;. Lee Kuan Yew eventually accused Lim Chin Siong and his supporters of being communists working for the Communist United Front, but evidence of Lim being a communist cadre was a matter of debate as many documents have yet to be declassified.

===First years in government===

The PAP eventually won the 1959 general election under Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s leadership. The election was also the first one to produce a fully elected parliament and a cabinet wielding powers of full internal self-government. The party has remained in power ever since, winning a majority of seats in every successive general election. Lee, who became the first Prime Minister and who will eventually helm this post for the next 31 years, requested the British for the release of the left-wing members of the PAP, including the likes of Devan Nair.

In 1961, the Singapore Trades Union Congress (STUC), which had backed the PAP back in 1959, split into the pro-PAP National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the non-affiliated and more leftist Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU). The SATU collapsed in 1963, following the now PAP-led government&#x27;s crackdown and detention of its leaders during Operation Coldstore and its subsequent official deregistration on 13 November 1963. The NTUC remains as the sole trade union centre in the country today and continues to have a close relationship with the PAP.

====Great Split of 1961====

In 1961, disagreements on the proposed merger plan to form Malaysia and long-standing internal party power struggle led to the split of the left-wing group from the PAP.

Although the &quot;communist&quot; faction had been frozen out of ever taking over the PAP, other problems had begun to arise internally. Ong Eng Guan, the former Mayor of the City Council after PAP&#x27;s victory in the 1957 Singapore City Council election, presented a set of &quot;16 Resolutions&quot; to revisit some issues previously explored by Chin Siong&#x27;s faction of the PAP: abolishing the PPSO, revising the Constitution, and changing the method of selecting cadre members.

Although Ong&#x27;s 16 Resolutions originated from the left-wing faction led by Lim Chin Siong, that faction had only reluctantly asked the PAP leadership to clarify its position on them, as they still thought that the party with Lee Kuan Yew at the helm was a better alternative than Ong who was regarded as mercurial and a tyrant. However, Lee took the stance taken by the left-wing PAP members as a lack of confidence in his leadership. This issue caused a rift between the &quot;moderate&quot; PAP members (led by Lee) and the &quot;left-wing&quot; faction (led by Lim).

Ong was then expelled, and he resigned his Assembly seat to challenge the government to a by-election in Hong Lim in April 1961, where he won 73.3% of the vote. This was despite the fact that Lee Kuan Yew had made a secret alliance with Fong Chong Pik, the leader of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), to get the CPM cadres to support the PAP in the by-election.

====Barisan Sosialis====
The breakaway group of members formed the Barisan Sosialis with Lim Chin Siong as secretary-general. Aside from the Chinese union leaders, lawyers Thampoe Thamby Rajah and Tann Wee Tiong, several members from the University Socialist Club such as James Puthucheary (uncle of Janil Puthucheary) and Poh Soo Kai joined the party. 35 of 51 branches of the PAP and 19 of 23 branch secretaries defected to Barisan.

===Merger years 1963–1965===

After gaining independence from Britain, Singapore joined the federation of Malaysia in 1963. Although the PAP was the ruling party in the state of Singapore, the PAP functioned as an opposition party at the federal level in the larger Malaysian political landscape. At that time and until the 2018 general election, the federal government in Kuala Lumpur was controlled by a coalition led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). However, the prospect that the PAP might rule Malaysia agitated UMNO. The PAP&#x27;s decision to contest federal parliamentary seats outside Singapore and the UMNO decision to contest seats within Singapore breached an unspoken agreement to respect each other&#x27;s spheres of influence and aggravated PAP–UMNO relations. The clash of personalities between PAP leader Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman resulted in a crisis and led to Rahman forcing Singapore to leave Malaysia on 9 August 1965. Upon independence, the nascent People&#x27;s Action Party of Malaya, which had been registered in Malaysia on 10 March 1964, had its registration cancelled on 9 September 1965, just a month after Singapore&#x27;s exit. Those with the now non-existent party applied to register People&#x27;s Action Party, Malaya which was again rejected by the Malaysian government, before settling with the Democratic Action Party (DAP).

===Post-independence, 1965 to present===

The PAP has held an overwhelming majority of seats in the Parliament of Singapore since 1966, when the opposition Barisan Sosialis (Socialist Front) resigned from Parliament after winning 13 seats following the 1963 general election, which took place months after a number of their leaders had been arrested in Operation Coldstore based on accusations of being communists affliated with the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM).

It subsequently achieved a monopoly in an expanding parliament (winning every parliamentary seat) for the next four elections (1968, 1972, 1976 and 1980). Opposition parties returned to the legislature at a 1981 by-election. The 1984 general election was the first election in 21 years in which opposition parties won seats. From then until 2006, the PAP faced four opposition MPs at most. Opposition parties did not win more than four parliamentary seats from 1984 until 2011 when the Workers&#x27; Party (WP) won six seats and took away a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) for the first time for any opposition party, as well as until 2020 by which an opposition party had won more than one GRC, which was also achieved by the WP.

Even so, the PAP still holds a supermajority in the legislature, to the point that Singapore is effectively a dominant party system similar to Japan&#x27;s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rule of the country. With its supermajority, the PAP has always had the ability to amend the Constitution of Singapore at will, including the introduction of multi-member constituencies under the GRC system (in 1988) or the Nominated Member of Parliament (NMPs) scheme (in 1990), which has helped strengthened the government&#x27;s dominance and control of Parliament.

==Leadership transitions==
The longtime governing party of Singapore, spans both past and present, but notably occurred in the mid-1980s where the first generation of PAP leaders in the CEC and the Cabinet of Singapore ceded power to a second generation of leaders.

===First to second generation===
By 1984, the &quot;old guard&quot; (first generation of party leaders) had been governing Singapore for approximately a quarter of a century. Aging leadership was a key concern, and then Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew sought to groom younger leaders. In a speech on 29 September 1984, Lee argued that though the first generation of leaders was still &quot;alert and fully in charge&quot;, to hang on to power until they had become feeble would allow power to be wrested from them, with no say in who their successors were.

On 30 September, at the Ordinary Party Conference, power was transferred to the second generation of leaders, who were elected to the Central Executive Committee in place of all the old CEC members; of the 14-member CEC, only Lee Kuan Yew remained the only &quot;old guard&quot; leader.

According to a report to the Library of Congress, the old guard were confident in their &quot;rectitude&quot; and discretion in using their extensive political powers for Singapore&#x27;s common good, but were not as confident in the next generation in doing so. Various limits on executive power were considered, in order to minimise the chances of corruption. These included a popularly elected President of Singapore with substantial, nonceremonial powers. This particular reform was enacted with a constitutional amendment in 1991.

The old guard also sought to eschew the use of PAP as a central political institution, seeking to &quot;depoliticise&quot; and disperse power among society, and sought to include low-level community leaders in government. A policy of cross-fertilisation was enacted: exchange of leaders, &quot;elites&quot; and talent would take place between private and government sectors, civilian and military segments of society, and between the party and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).

===Second to third generation===
The next generation of leaders in the late 1980s was split between the factions of then Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong and the older, more-experienced Goh Chok Tong. Lee Hsien Loong was supported by bureaucrats in the Ministry of Defence and army colleagues in the Singapore Armed Forces; Goh Chok Tong had more influence in the Singapore Civil Service, the Cabinet and government-linked companies.

Lee Kuan Yew himself remained Prime Minister and in the CEC until 1990, when he stepped down in favour of Goh Chok Tong as PM. Lee Hsien Loong became PM in 2004.

===Third to fourth generation===
On 23 November 2018, fourth-generation leadership members, then–Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat and then Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing were elected as the First and Second Assistant Secretaries-General respectively, the second and third highest positions of the party. They had replaced then Assistant Secretaries-General Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam. A significant step of the leadership transition from the third-generation leaders to the fourth-generation leaders.

On 1 May 2019, Heng Swee Keat was appointed the new and sole Deputy Prime Minister, replacing Teo and Tharman. He was then widely seen as the 4th and next Prime Minister and Secretary-General of PAP succeeding incumbent Lee Hsien Loong. However on 8 April 2021, Heng surprisingly announced he would step down as the fourth-generation leader and step aside to pave way for younger and healthier leaders to take over the leadership and stressed that health and age as concerns of this decision. After his decision, several Cabinet members were seen as the possible candidates to succeed Heng, ranging from Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing.

On 14 April 2022, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong was selected as the new leader of the PAP&#x27;s fourth-generation (4G) team, succeeding Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat who had stepped down as 4G leader. Wong received an &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of support in the consultation process, surpassing that of other nominees. His candidacy was unanimously endorsed by the cabinet and subsequently, by the PAP MPs at a party caucus on 14 April. On 4 December 2024, he was elected as the Secretary-General of People&#x27;s Action Party, with an endorsement from Lee Hsien Loong for the appointment.

== Organisation ==
During its initial years, the party had adopted a traditional Leninist form of party organisation, together with a vanguard cadre from its labour-leaning faction. The PAP Executive later expelled the leftist faction in 1961, bringing the ideological basis of the party into the centre and later in the 1960s moving further to the right.

In the beginning, there were about 500 so-called temporary cadres appointed, however the current number of cadres is unknown, with the register of cadres being kept confidential. In 1988, Wong Kan Seng revealed that there were more than 1,000 cadres.

Cadre members have the right to attend party conferences and to vote for and elect and to be elected into the Central Executive Committee (CEC), the pinnacle of party leaders.

To become a cadre, a party member must be first nominated by the MP in their branch. The candidate will then undergo three sessions of interview, each with four to five ministers or MPs and the appointment is then made by the CEC. About 100 candidates are nominated each year.

===Central Executive Committee and Secretary-General===
Political power in the party is concentrated in the CEC, led by the secretary-general. The secretary-general of the PAP is the leader of the party. Due to PAP&#x27;s electoral victories in every general election since 1959, the prime minister of Singapore has been by convention the secretary-general of the PAP since 1959. Key appointments in the CEC are usually Cabinet members.

From 1957 onward, the rules laid down that the outgoing CEC should recommend a list of candidates from which the cadre members can then vote for the next CEC. This has recently changed so that the CEC nominates eight members and the party caucus selects the remaining ten.

Historically, the position of Secretary-General was not considered for the office of Prime Minister, but rather the Central Executive Committee held an election to choose the prime minister. There was a contest between PAP Secretary-General Lee Kuan Yew and PAP Treasurer Ong Eng Guan, prior to 1959. Lee subsequently won the leadership and was inaugurated as the first prime minister of Singapore.

===HQ Executive Committee===
The next lower level committee is the HQ Executive Committee (HQ EXCO) which performs the party&#x27;s administration and oversees 14 sub-committees.

The sub-committees are the following:
# Branch Appointments and Relations
# Constituency Relations
# Information and Feedback
# New Media
# Malay Affairs
# Membership Recruitment and Cadre Selection
# PAP Awards
# Political Education
# Publicity and Publication
# Social and Recreational
# Women&#x27;s Wing (WW)
# Young PAP (YP)
# PAP Seniors Group (PAP.SG)
# PAP Policy Forum (PPF)

===Young PAP and internet presence===
The Young PAP is the youth-wing of the party, serving as a youth organisation for young adults and students in Singapore who support the PAP and have an interest in politics. The incumbent chairman of the youth-wing is Janil Puthucheary. The YP&#x27;s predecessor, the PAP Youth Committee, was established in 1986, under Lee Hsien Loong&#x27;s tenure as Chairman. All PAP members under the age of 35 had then been grouped under the Youth Committee. In 1993, the Youth Committee was renamed the Young PAP. In an effort to attract members, then Chairman George Yeo said that people joining the YP could take positions different from central party leadership. The age limit was raised from 35 to 40. Memberships are issued through the PAP branches under each constituency in Singapore. By 2005, the committee had grown to more than 6,000 members. In 2010, then Vice-Chairman Zaqy Mohamad said the YP attracts over 1200 new members that year, an increase on the 1000 new members in 2009.

Since 1995, the youth-wing of the PAP has had an internet presence that aims to &quot;correct &#x27;misinformation&#x27; about Singapore politics or culture&quot;. Under the urging of then Minister for Information and the Arts George Yeo, Young PAP took charge of running several online websites to create an online presence for the party. After popular forum Sintercom was shut down in 2001, the Young PAP offered their own forum for moderated discussions. They have since set up various blogs and social media accounts with multimedia content to engage the masses.

In February 2007, it was reported by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; that the PAP&#x27;s new media committee chaired by Minister Ng Eng Hen, had initiated an effort to counter critics anonymously on the Internet &quot;as it was necessary for the PAP to have a voice on cyberspace&quot;. The initiative was divided by two sub-committees, one of which was in charge of strategising the campaigns and is co-headed by Minister Lui Tuck Yew and MP Zaqy Mohamad. The other sub-committee—new media capabilities group led by MPs Baey Yam Keng and Josephine Teo executed the strategies. The initiative was set up after the 2006 general election and also included around 20 IT-savvy PAP activists.

=== Friends of the PAP ===
The PAP has a long-running programme, known as &#x27;Friends of the PAP&#x27; by which it enlists individuals and organisations to assist in promoting its political goals. In 2002, secretary-general Goh Chok Tong announced an intention to expand this programme, which at the time was primarily limited to &quot;establishment figures&quot; in the public and private sector. He established a related scheme titled &quot;Young Friends of the PAP&quot; to attract Singaporeans below the age of 40 as well and explained that the intention was to &quot;refresh&quot; the PAP and improve the &quot;quality&quot; of PAP&#x27;s membership. Membership as a &#x27;Young Friend&#x27; was by invitation only, and the group was limited to about 500 people.

According to local media reports, the Friends of the PAP programme had &quot;fallen out of the public consciousness&quot; after 2002. However, in June 2024, the PAP revived the Friends of the PAP programme and expanded it, now with a renewed focus on local social media influencers, with the intention to connect with a wider and younger audience. The PAP did not respond to media queries about whether the Friends of the PAP programme remained invite-only or what the rules of engagement for members of the programme were.

== Ideology ==

===Asian democracy===
Professor Hussin Mutalib from the National University of Singapore (NUS) opines that the PAP has often set forth the idea of Asian democracy and values, drawing from a notion of Asian culture and Confucianism to construct ideological bulwarks against Western democracy. He added that for founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, &quot;Singapore would be better off without Western-style liberal democracy&quot;.

Consequently, the governance of the PAP has occasionally been characterised by some observers, especially in the West, as semi-authoritarian by liberal democratic standards or having turned Singapore into a nanny state. According to Professor Kenneth Paul Tan from the NUS, the PAP proclaim that many Singaporeans continue to vote for the party as economic considerations, pragmatism and stability triumph over accountability and checks and balances by opposition parties.

===Economic policies===

The party economic ideology has always accepted the need for some welfare spending, and pragmatic economic interventionism. However, free-market policies have been popular since the 1980s as part of the wider implementation of a meritocracy in civil society and Singapore frequently ranks extremely highly on indices of economic freedom published by economically liberal organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Singapore is also the only Asian country with the top AAA sovereign rating from the &quot;Big Three&quot; credit rating agencies of S&amp;P, Moody&#x27;s and Fitch.

Lee Kuan Yew once said in 1992: &quot;Through Hong Kong watching, I concluded that state welfare and subsidies blunted the individual&#x27;s drive to succeed. I watched with amazement the ease with which Hong Kong workers adjusted their salaries upwards in boom times and downwards in recessions. I resolved to reverse course on the welfare policies which my party had inherited or copied from British Labour Party policies&quot;.

Notably, since Singapore’s independence in 1965, the party has also supported the creation of state-owned enterprises, known within Singapore as Government-linked Corporations (GLCs), in order to jumpstart industrialisation, spearhead economic development and lead to economic growth (primarily job creation) in various sectors of the Singaporean economy as there was a lack of private sector funds and expertise, particularly in the early years of nationhood. Various GLCs were formed to pursue strategic sectors such as in ship building and repair (Sembcorp Marine, Keppel Corporation), aviation and defence (Singapore Airlines, ST Engineering), telecommunications (Singtel), real estate (CapitaLand) and development finance (DBS Bank) amongst others. In addition, various GLCs were set up as private-public partnerships, notable as joint ventures or strategic alliances with foreign companies or investors with relevant expertise, particularly in the petrochemicals and oil refining industries.

===Social policies===
Since the early years of the PAP&#x27;s rule, the idea of survival as a small and vulnerable country with hostile neighbours has been a central theme of Singaporean politics. According to Diane Mauzy and R. S. Milne, most analysts of Singapore have discerned four major ideologies of the PAP, namely pragmatism, meritocracy, multiracialism and Asian values/communitarianism. The PAP also advocates nationalism not based on ethnocentrism, encouraging a united Singaporean identity while also recognising the main ethnic groups that make up the country.

In January 1989, then President Wee Kim Wee in his opening address to the 7th Parliament of Singapore stated that Singapore must adopt a set of shared national values. He was of the view that a national ideology was useful to bond Singaporeans together by preserving the cultural heritage of the core communities of Singapore, and upholding certain common values that would capture the essence of being a Singaporean. In response, the government set up a committee as a follow up to Wee&#x27;s proposal, and in January 1991, the PAP formally introduced a white paper on &quot;Shared Values&quot; for the country, which consists of five national values to forge a national identity. These values were – nation before community and society above self; family as the basic unit of society; regard and community support for the individual; consensus instead of contention, and racial and religious harmony. They were also set as a contrast against the &quot;more Westernised, individualistic, and self-centred outlook on life&quot; and to uphold the &quot;traditional Asian ideas of morality, duty and society&quot;.

At an Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) dialogue held on 2 July 2015 and chaired by Fareed Zakaria, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke about the need to maintain a Jeffersonian natural aristocracy in the system to instill a culture of respect and to avoid anarchy. In November 2019, Lee stated at a party convention that the PAP must not allow the &quot;disconnect between the masses and the elite seen in other countries to take root in Singapore.&quot; During the election campaign in July 2020, Lee&#x27;s estranged brother over 38 Oxley Road, Lee Hsien Yang, accused the PAP of elitism as one of his explanations of joining the Progress Singapore Party (PSP). In a 2024 interview, Lee Hsien Loong would criticize wokeness, claiming that it causes life to be burdensome and saying that he did not want Singapore to go in that direction.

===Views on other ideologies===
Particularly during the climate of the Cold War, the party was openly hostile to communist or left-wing political ideologies despite a brief joint alliance with the pro-labour co-founders of the PAP during the party&#x27;s early years, who were eventually accused of being communists and arrested. Nevertheless, Singapore formally joined the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1970 and did not openly align with the Capitalist Bloc. In 1987, as part of Operation Spectrum, the PAP government arrested various individuals under accusations of plotting to overthrow the government and to establish a communist state. Since the 2010s, the party while remaining largely conservative was seen by some observers as to have adopted a more centre-left tack in certain areas in order to remain electorally dominant.

The socialism practised by the PAP during its first few decades in power was of a pragmatic kind as characterised by the party&#x27;s rejection of nationalisation. According to Chan Heng Chee, by the late 1970s the intellectual credo of the government rested explicitly upon a philosophy of self-reliance, similar to the rugged individualism of the American brand of capitalism. Despite this, the PAP still claimed to be a socialist party, pointing out its regulation of the private sector, activist intervention in the economy and social policies as evidence of this. In 1976, the PAP formally resigned from the Socialist International (SI) after the Dutch Labour Party had initially proposed to expel the PAP on allegations of indefinite detention of political prisoners, alluding to Chia Thye Poh.

===Symbolism===
The PAP symbol, which is a red thunderbolt and blue circle on white, stands for action inside multicultural unity. It also appears on party flags on parades. PAP members at party rallies have customarily worn a uniform of white shirts and white trousers which symbolises incorruptibility and purity of the party&#x27;s ideologies of the government.
