<text>Serine (symbol Ser or S) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated − form under biological conditions), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated − form under biological conditions), and a side chain consisting of a hydroxymethyl group, classifying it as a polar amino acid. It can be synthesized in the human body under normal physiological circumstances, making it a nonessential amino acid. It is encoded by the codons UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU and AGC.

== Occurrence ==

This compound is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. Only the -stereoisomer appears naturally in proteins. It is not essential to the human diet, since it is synthesized in the body from other metabolites, including glycine. Serine was first obtained from silk protein, a particularly rich source, in 1865 by Emil Cramer. Its name is derived from the Latin for silk, &quot;&quot;. Serine&#x27;s structure was established in 1902.

== Biosynthesis ==
The biosynthesis of serine starts with the oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate (an intermediate from glycolysis) to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate and NADH by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (). Reductive amination (transamination) of this ketone by phosphoserine transaminase () yields 3-phosphoserine (&quot;O&quot;-phosphoserine) which is hydrolyzed to serine by phosphoserine phosphatase ().

In bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; these enzymes are encoded by the genes serA (EC 1.1.1.95), serC (EC 2.6.1.52), and serB (EC 3.1.3.3).
Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SMHT) also catalyzes the biosynthesis of glycine (retro-aldol cleavage) from serine, transferring the resulting formalddehyde synthon to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. However, that reaction is reversible, and will convert excess glycine to serine. SHMT is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme.

==Synthesis and reactions==
Industrially, -serine is produced from glycine and methanol catalyzed by hydroxymethyltransferase.

Racemic serine can be prepared in the laboratory from methyl acrylate in several steps:

Hydrogenation of serine gives the diol serinol:

== Biological function ==

=== Metabolic ===
Serine is important in metabolism in that it participates in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. It is the precursor to several amino acids including glycine and cysteine, as well as tryptophan in bacteria. It is also the precursor to numerous other metabolites, including sphingolipids and folate, which is the principal donor of one-carbon fragments in biosynthesis.

=== Signaling ===
-Serine, synthesized in neurons by serine racemase from -serine (its enantiomer), serves as a neuromodulator by coactivating NMDA receptors, making them able to open if they then also bind glutamate. -serine is a potent agonist at the glycine site (NR1) of canonical diheteromeric NMDA receptors. For the receptor to open, glutamate and either glycine or -serine must bind to it; in addition a pore blocker must not be bound (e.g. Mg2+ or Zn2+). Some research has shown that -serine is a more potent agonist at the NMDAR glycine site than glycine itself. However, D-serine has been shown to work as an antagonist/inverse co-agonist of &quot;t&quot;-NMDA receptors through the glycine binding site on the GluN3 subunit.

== Ligands ==
-serine was thought to exist only in bacteria until relatively recently; it was the second amino acid discovered to naturally exist in humans, present as a signaling molecule in the brain, soon after the discovery of -aspartate. Had amino acids been discovered in humans sooner, the glycine site on the NMDA receptor might instead be named the -serine site. Apart from central nervous system, -serine plays a signaling role in peripheral tissues and organs such as cartilage, kidney, and corpus cavernosum.

=== Gustatory sensation ===
Pure -serine is an off-white crystalline powder with a very faint musty aroma. -Serine is sweet with an additional minor sour taste at medium and high concentrations.

== Clinical significance ==
Serine deficiency disorders are rare defects in the biosynthesis of the amino acid -serine. At present three disorders have been reported:

* 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency
* 3-phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency
* Phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency

These enzyme defects lead to severe neurological symptoms such as congenital microcephaly and severe psychomotor retardation and in addition, in patients with 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency to intractable seizures. These symptoms respond to a variable degree to treatment with -serine, sometimes combined with glycine.
Response to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype/phenotype correlation and outcome of these diseases their impact on the quality of life of patients, as well as for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies a patient registry was established by the noncommercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD).

Besides disruption of serine biosynthesis, its transport may also become disrupted. One example is spastic tetraplegia, thin corpus callosum, and progressive microcephaly, a disease caused by mutations that affect the function of the neutral amino acid transporter A.

=== Research for therapeutic use ===
The classification of -serine as a non-essential amino acid has come to be considered as conditional, since vertebrates such as humans cannot always synthesize optimal quantities over entire lifespans. Safety of -serine has been demonstrated in an FDA-approved human phase I clinical trial with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS, patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01835782), but treatment of ALS symptoms has yet to be shown. A 2011 meta-analysis found adjunctive sarcosine to have a medium effect size for negative and total symptoms of schizophrenia. There also is evidence that ‐serine could acquire a therapeutic role in diabetes.
-Serine is being studied in rodents as a potential treatment for schizophrenia. -Serine also has been described as a potential biomarker for early Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) diagnosis, due to a relatively high concentration of it in the cerebrospinal fluid of probable AD patients. D-serine, which is made in the brain, has been shown to work as an antagonist/inverse co-agonist of &quot;t&quot;-NMDA receptors mitigating neuron loss in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

-Serine has been theorized as a potential treatment for sensorineural hearing disorders such as hearing loss and tinnitus.

<doc id="63552" wikidata="Q17153" url="?curid=63552" title="Amylase">
<text>An amylase () is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of starch (Latin &quot;&quot;) into sugars. Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potatoes, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. The pancreas and salivary gland make amylase (alpha amylase) to hydrolyse dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy. Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase. Specific amylase proteins are designated by different Greek letters. All amylases are glycoside hydrolases and act on α-1,4-glycosidic bonds.

==Classification==

===α-Amylase===

The α-amylases () (CAS 9014–71–5) (alternative names: 1,4-α--glucan glucanohydrolase; glycogenase) are calcium metalloenzymes. By acting at random locations along the starch chain, α-amylase breaks down long-chain saccharides, ultimately yielding either maltotriose and maltose from amylose, or maltose, glucose and &quot;limit dextrin&quot; from amylopectin. They belong to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (https://www.cazypedia.org/index.php/Glycoside_Hydrolase_Family_13).

Because it can act anywhere on the substrate, α-amylase tends to be faster-acting than β-amylase. In animals, it is a major digestive enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7–7.0.

In human physiology, both the salivary and pancreatic amylases are α-amylases.

The α-amylase form is also found in plants, fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) and bacteria (&quot;Bacillus&quot;).

===β-Amylase===

Another form of amylase, β-amylase () (alternative names: 1,4-α--glucan maltohydrolase; glycogenase; saccharogen amylase) is also synthesized by bacteria, fungi, and plants. Working from the non-reducing end, β-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the second α-1,4 glycosidic bond, cleaving off two glucose units (maltose) at a time. During the ripening of fruit, β-amylase breaks starch into maltose, resulting in the sweet flavor of ripe fruit. They belong to glycoside hydrolase family 14.

Both α-amylase and β-amylase are present in seeds; β-amylase is present in an inactive form prior to germination, whereas α-amylase and proteases appear once germination has begun. Many microbes also produce amylase to degrade extracellular starches. Animal tissues do not contain β-amylase, although it may be present in microorganisms contained within the digestive tract. The optimum pH for β-amylase is 4.0–5.0.

===γ-Amylase===
γ-Amylase () (alternative names: Glucan 1,4-a-glucosidase; amyloglucosidase; &quot;exo&quot;-1,4-α-glucosidase; glucoamylase; lysosomal α-glucosidase; 1,4-α--glucan glucohydrolase) will cleave α(1–6) glycosidic linkages, as well as the last α-1,4 glycosidic bond at the nonreducing end of amylose and amylopectin, yielding glucose. The γ-amylase has the most acidic optimum pH of all amylases because it is most active around pH 3. They belong to a variety of different glycoside hydrolase families, such as glycoside hydrolase family 15 in fungi, glycoside hydrolase family 31 of human MGAM, and glycoside hydrolase family 97 of bacterial forms.

==Uses==

===Fermentation===
α- and β-amylases are important in brewing beer and liquor made from sugars derived from starch. In fermentation, yeast ingests sugars and excretes ethanol. In beer and some liquors, the sugars present at the beginning of fermentation have been produced by &quot;mashing&quot; grains or other starch sources (such as potatoes). In traditional beer brewing, malted barley is mixed with hot water to create a &quot;mash&quot;, which is held at a given temperature to allow the amylases in the malted grain to convert the barley&#x27;s starch into sugars. Different temperatures optimize the activity of alpha or beta amylase, resulting in different mixtures of fermentable and unfermentable sugars. In selecting mash temperature and grain-to-water ratio, a brewer can change the alcohol content, mouthfeel, aroma, and flavor of the finished beer.

In some historic methods of producing alcoholic beverages, the conversion of starch to sugar starts with the brewer chewing grain to mix it with saliva. This practice continues to be practiced in home production of some traditional drinks, such as chhaang in the Himalayas, chicha in the Andes and kasiri in Brazil and Suriname.

===Flour additive===
Amylases are used in breadmaking and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of ethanol and carbon dioxide. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This is the reason for long fermented doughs such as sourdough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.

α-Amylase is often listed as an ingredient on commercially package-milled flour. Bakers with long exposure to amylase-enriched flour are at risk of developing dermatitis or asthma.

===Molecular biology===
In molecular biology, the presence of amylase can serve as an additional method of selecting for successful integration of a reporter construct in addition to antibiotic resistance. As reporter genes are flanked by homologous regions of the structural gene for amylase, successful integration will disrupt the amylase gene and prevent starch degradation, which is easily detectable through iodine staining.

===Medical uses===
Amylase also has medical applications in the use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). It is one of the components in Sollpura (liprotamase) to help in the breakdown of saccharides into simple sugars.

===Other uses===
An inhibitor of alpha-amylase, called phaseolamin, has been tested as a potential diet aid.

When used as a food additive, amylase has E number E1100, and may be derived from pig pancreas or mold fungi.

Bacilliary amylase is also used in clothing and dishwasher detergents to dissolve starches from fabrics and dishes.

Factory workers who work with amylase for any of the above uses are at increased risk of occupational asthma. Five to nine percent of bakers have a positive skin test, and a fourth to a third of bakers with breathing problems are hypersensitive to amylase.

==Hyperamylasemia==
Blood serum amylase may be measured for purposes of medical diagnosis. A higher than normal concentration may reflect any of several medical conditions, including acute inflammation of the pancreas (which may be measured concurrently with the more specific lipase), perforated peptic ulcer, torsion of an ovarian cyst, strangulation, ileus, mesenteric ischemia, macroamylasemia and mumps. Amylase may be measured in other body fluids, including urine and peritoneal fluid.

A January 2007 study from Washington University in St. Louis suggests that saliva tests of the enzyme could be used to indicate sleep deficits, as the enzyme increases its activity in correlation with the length of time a subject has been deprived of sleep.

==History==
In 1831, Erhard Friedrich Leuchs (1800–1837) described the hydrolysis of starch by saliva, due to the presence of an enzyme in saliva, &quot;ptyalin&quot;, an amylase. it was named after the Ancient Greek name for saliva: - .

The modern history of enzymes began in 1833, when French chemists Anselme Payen and Jean-François Persoz isolated an amylase complex from germinating barley and named it &quot;diastase&quot;. It is from this term that all subsequent enzyme names tend to end in the suffix -ase.

In 1862, Russian biochemist (1838–1923) separated pancreatic amylase from trypsin.

==Evolution==

=== Salivary amylase ===

Saccharides are a food source rich in energy. Large polymers such as starch are partially hydrolyzed in the mouth by the enzyme amylase before being cleaved further into sugars. Many mammals have seen great expansions in the copy number of the amylase gene. These duplications allow for the pancreatic amylase &quot;AMY2&quot; to re-target to the salivary glands, allowing animals to detect starch by taste and to digest starch more efficiently and in higher quantities. This has happened independently in mice, rats, dogs, pigs, and most importantly, humans after the agricultural revolution.

Following the agricultural revolution 12,000 years ago, human diet began to shift more to plant and animal domestication in place of hunting and gathering. Starch has become a staple of the human diet.

Despite the obvious benefits, early humans did not possess salivary amylase, a trend that is also seen in evolutionary relatives of the human, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, who possess either one or no copies of the gene responsible for producing salivary amylase.

Like in other mammals, the pancreatic alpha-amylase &quot;AMY2&quot; was duplicated multiple times. One event allowed it to evolve salivary specificity, leading to the production of amylase in the saliva (named in humans as &quot;AMY1&quot;). The 1p21.1 region of human chromosome 1 contains many copies of these genes, variously named &quot;AMY1A&quot;, &quot;AMY1B&quot;, &quot;AMY1C&quot;, &quot;AMY2A&quot;, &quot;AMY2B&quot;, and so on.

However, not all humans possess the same number of copies of the &quot;AMY1&quot; gene. Populations known to rely more on saccharides have a higher number of AMY1 copies than human populations that, by comparison, consume little starch. The number of &quot;AMY1&quot; gene copies in humans can range from six copies in agricultural groups such as European-American and Japanese (two high starch populations) to only two to three copies in hunter-gatherer societies such as the Biaka, Datog, and Yakuts.

The correlation that exists between starch consumption and number of &quot;AMY1&quot; copies specific to population suggest that more AMY1 copies in high starch populations has been selected for by natural selection and considered the favorable phenotype for those individuals. Therefore, it is most likely that the benefit of an individual possessing more copies of &quot;AMY1&quot; in a high starch population increases fitness and produces healthier, fitter offspring.

This fact is especially apparent when comparing geographically close populations with different eating habits that possess a different number of copies of the &quot;AMY1&quot; gene. Such is the case for some Asian populations that have been shown to possess few &quot;AMY1&quot; copies relative to some agricultural populations in Asia. This offers strong evidence that natural selection has acted on this gene as opposed to the possibility that the gene has spread through genetic drift.

Variations of amylase copy number in dogs mirrors that of human populations, suggesting they acquired the extra copies as they followed humans around. Unlike humans whose amylase levels depend on starch content in diet, wild animals eating a broad range of foods tend to have more copies of amylase. This may have to do with mainly detection of starch as opposed to digestion.

<doc id="63553" wikidata="Q186521" url="?curid=63553" title="Threonine">
<text>Threonine (symbol Thr or T) is an amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH form when dissolved in water), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form when dissolved in water), and a side chain containing a hydroxyl group, making it a polar, uncharged amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet. Threonine is synthesized from aspartate in bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot;. It is encoded by all the codons starting AC (ACU, ACC, ACA, and ACG).

Threonine sidechains are often hydrogen bonded; the most common small motifs formed are based on interactions with serine: ST turns, ST motifs (often at the beginning of alpha helices) and ST staples (usually at the middle of alpha helices).

==Modifications==

The threonine residue is susceptible to numerous posttranslational modifications. The hydroxyl side-chain can undergo &quot;O&quot;-linked glycosylation. In addition, threonine residues undergo phosphorylation through the action of a threonine kinase. In its phosphorylated form, it can be referred to as phosphothreonine. Phosphothreonine has three potential coordination sites (carboxyl, amine and phosphate group) and determination of the mode of coordination between phosphorylated ligands and metal ions occurring in an organism is important to explain the function of the phosphothreonine in biological processes.

==History==
Threonine was the last of the 20 common proteinogenic amino acids to be discovered. It was discovered in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, collaborating with Curtis Meyer. The amino acid was named threonine because it was similar in structure to threonic acid, a four-carbon monosaccharide with molecular formula C4H8O5

==Stereoisomers==
Threonine is one of two proteinogenic amino acids with two stereogenic centers, the other being isoleucine. Threonine can exist in four possible stereoisomers with the following configurations: (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;), (2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;), (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;) and (2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;). However, the name -threonine is used for one single stereoisomer, (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;)-2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid. The stereoisomer (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;), which is rarely present in nature, is called -allothreonine.

==Biosynthesis==
As an essential amino acid, threonine is not synthesized in humans, and needs to be present in proteins in the diet. Adult humans require about 20 mg/kg body weight/day. In plants and microorganisms, threonine is synthesized from aspartic acid via α-aspartyl-semialdehyde and homoserine. Homoserine undergoes &quot;O&quot;-phosphorylation; this phosphate ester undergoes hydrolysis concomitant with relocation of the OH group. Enzymes involved in a typical biosynthesis of threonine include:
# aspartokinase
# β-aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase
# homoserine dehydrogenase
# homoserine kinase
# threonine synthase.

==Metabolism==
Threonine is metabolized in at least three ways:
* In many animals it is converted to pyruvate via threonine dehydrogenase. An intermediate in this pathway can undergo thiolysis with CoA to produce acetyl-CoA and glycine.
* In humans the gene for threonine dehydrogenase is an inactive pseudogene, so threonine is converted to α-ketobutyrate. The mechanism of the first step is analogous to that catalyzed by serine dehydratase, and the serine and threonine dehydratase reactions are probably catalyzed by the same enzyme.
* In many organisms it is O-phosphorylated by a kinase preparatory to further metabolism. This is especially important in bacteria as part of the biosynthesis of cobalamin (Vitamin B12), as the product is converted to (R)-1-aminopropan-2-ol for incorporation into the vitamin&#x27;s sidechain.
*Threonine is used to synthesize glycine during the endogenous production of L-carnitine in the brain and liver of rats.

== Metabolic diseases ==
The degradation of threonine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases:

* Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA)
* Methylmalonic acidemia
* Propionic acidemia

== Research of Threonine as a Dietary Supplement in Animals ==
Effects of threonine dietary supplementation have been researched in broilers.

An essential amino acid, threonine is involved in the metabolism of fats, the creation of proteins, the proliferation and differentiation of embryonic stem cells, and the health and function of the intestines. Animal health and illness are strongly correlated with the need for and metabolism of threonine. Intestinal inflammation and energy metabolism disorders in animals may be alleviated by appropriate amounts of dietary threonine. Nevertheless, because these effects pertain to the control of nutrition metabolism, more research is required to confirm the results in various animal models. Furthermore, more research is needed to understand how threonine controls the dynamic equilibrium of the intestinal barrier function, immunological response and gut flora.

==Sources==
Foods high in threonine include cottage cheese, poultry, fish, meat, lentils, black turtle bean and sesame seeds.

Racemic threonine can be prepared from crotonic acid by alpha-functionalization using mercury(II) acetate.

<doc id="63554" wikidata="Q483752" url="?curid=63554" title="Valine">
<text>Valine (symbol Val or V) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain isopropyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid. Valine is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it; it must be obtained from dietary sources which are foods that contain proteins, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. It is encoded by all codons starting with GU (GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG).

==History and etymology==
Valine was first isolated from casein in 1901 by Hermann Emil Fischer. The name valine comes from its structural similarity to valeric acid, which in turn is named after the plant valerian due to the presence of the acid in the roots of the plant.

==Nomenclature==
According to IUPAC, carbon atoms forming valine are numbered sequentially starting from 1 denoting the carboxyl carbon, whereas 4 and 4&#x27; denote the two terminal methyl carbons.

==Metabolism==
===Source and biosynthesis===
Valine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is synthesized by bacteria and plants, but not by animals. It is therefore an essential amino acid in animals, and needs to be present in the diet. Adult humans require about 24 mg/kg body weight daily. It is synthesized in plants and bacteria via several steps starting from pyruvic acid. The initial part of the pathway also leads to leucine. The intermediate α-ketoisovalerate undergoes reductive amination with glutamate. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include:
# Acetolactate synthase (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase)
# Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase
# Dihydroxyacid dehydratase
# Valine aminotransferase

=== Degradation ===
Like other branched-chain amino acids, the catabolism of valine starts with the removal of the amino group by transamination, giving alpha-ketoisovalerate, an alpha-keto acid, which is converted to isobutyryl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. This is further oxidised and rearranged to succinyl-CoA, which can enter the citric acid cycle and provide direct fuel in muscle tissue.

==Synthesis==
Racemic valine can be synthesized by bromination of isovaleric acid followed by amination of the α-bromo derivative.
:HO2CCH2CH(CH3)2 + Br2 → HO2CCHBrCH(CH3)2 + HBr
:HO2CCHBrCH(CH3)2 + 2 NH3 → HO2CCH(NH2)CH(CH3)2 + NH4Br

== Medical significance ==

=== Metabolic diseases ===
The degradation of valine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases:

* Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA)
* Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)
* Methylmalonic acidemia
* Propionic acidemia

=== Insulin resistance ===
Lower levels of serum valine, like other branched-chain amino acids, are associated with weight loss and decreased insulin resistance: higher levels of valine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. Mice fed a BCAA-deprived diet for one day had improved insulin sensitivity, and feeding of a valine-deprived diet for one week significantly decreases blood glucose levels. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of valine and the other branched-chain amino acids resulted in a rapid reversal of the adiposity and an improvement in glucose-level control. The valine catabolite 3-hydroxyisobutyrate promotes insulin resistance in mice by stimulating fatty acid uptake into muscle and lipid accumulation. In mice, a BCAA-restricted diet decreased fasting blood glucose levels and improved body composition.

=== Hematopoietic stem cells ===
Dietary valine is essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, as demonstrated by experiments in mice. Dietary valine restriction selectively depletes long-term repopulating HSC in mouse bone marrow. Successful stem cell transplantation was achieved in mice without irradiation after 3 weeks on a valine restricted diet. Long-term survival of the transplanted mice was achieved when valine was returned to the diet gradually over a 2-week period to avoid refeeding syndrome.

<doc id="63556" wikidata="Q181819" url="?curid=63556" title="Fredric March">
<text>Fredric March (born Ernest Frederick McIntyre Bickel; August 31, 1897 – April 14, 1975) was an American actor, regarded as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most celebrated stars of the 1930s and 1940s. As a performer he was known for his versatility. He received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and two Tony Awards as well as nominations for three BAFTA Awards and three Emmy Awards.

March began his career in 1920, by working as an extra in movies filmed in New York City. He made his stage debut on Broadway in 1926 at the age of 29, and by the end of the decade, he had signed a film contract with Paramount Pictures. He made seven pictures in 1929. He went on to receive
two Academy Awards, for his performances in &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946). His other Oscar-nominated performances were in the films &quot;The Royal Family of Broadway&quot; (1930), &quot;A Star is Born&quot; (1937), and &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1951). 

March gained popularity after establishing himself with leading man roles in films such as &quot;Honor Among Lovers&quot; (1931), &quot;Merrily We Go to Hell&quot; (1932), &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1933), &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;, &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; (both 1934), &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; (all 1935), &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (1937), and &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; (1942). His later film roles include &quot;Executive Suite&quot;, &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; (both 1954), &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; (1955), &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960), and &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964). He made his final film appearance in &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; (1973).

March was also known for his stage roles; he made his Broadway debut in the play &quot;The Melody Man&quot; (1926), and during his stage career he twice won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play, for his performances in the Ruth Gordon play &quot;Years Ago&quot; (1947) and in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1956). He and Helen Hayes are the only actors to have won both the Academy Award and the Tony Award twice.

==Early life==
March was born in Racine, Wisconsin, the son of Cora Brown Marcher (1863–1936), a schoolteacher from England, and John F. Bickel (1859–1941), a devout Presbyterian Church elder who worked in the wholesale hardware business. March attended the Winslow Elementary School (established in 1855), Racine High School, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi.

March served in the United States Army during World War I as an artillery lieutenant.

He began a career as a banker, but an emergency appendectomy caused him to re-evaluate his life and, in 1920, he began working as an &quot;extra&quot; in movies made in New York City, using a shortened form of his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He appeared on Broadway in 1926, and by the end of the decade, he signed a film contract with Paramount Pictures.

==Career==

Like Laurence Olivier, March had a rare protean quality to his acting that allowed him to assume almost any persona convincingly, from Robert Browning to William Jennings Bryan to Dr Jekyll - or Mr. Hyde. He received an Oscar nomination for the 4th Academy Awards in 1930 for &quot;The Royal Family of Broadway&quot;, in which he played a role modeled on John Barrymore. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the 5th Academy Awards in 1932 for &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (tied with Wallace Beery for &quot;The Champ&quot;, although March accrued one more vote than Beery). This led to roles in a series of classic films based on stage hits and classic novels like &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1933) with Gary Cooper and Miriam Hopkins; &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; (1934); &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1935) with Charles Laughton; &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1935) with Greta Garbo; &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936) with Olivia de Havilland; and as the original Norman Maine in &quot;A Star is Born&quot; (1937) with Janet Gaynor, for which he received his third Academy Award nomination.

March resisted signing long-term contracts with the studios, enabling him to play roles in films from a variety of studios. He returned to Broadway after a ten-year absence in 1937 with a notable flop, &quot;Yr. Obedient Husband&quot;, but after the success of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, he focused as much on Broadway as on Hollywood. He won two Best Actor Tony Awards: in 1947 for the play &quot;Years Ago&quot;, written by Ruth Gordon, and in 1957 for his performance as James Tyrone in the original Broadway production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot;. He also had major successes in &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot; in 1944 and &quot;Gideon&quot; in 1961, and he played in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; on Broadway in 1951. During this period, he also starred in films, including &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; (1942) and &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot; (1948). March won his second Oscar in 1946 for &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;.

March also branched out into television, winning Emmy nominations for his third attempt at &quot;The Royal Family&quot; for the series &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot; as well as for television performances as Samuel Dodsworth and Ebenezer Scrooge. On March 25, 1954, March co-hosted the 26th Annual Academy Awards ceremony from New York City, with co-host Donald O&#x27;Connor in Los Angeles.

March&#x27;s neighbor in Connecticut, playwright Arthur Miller, was thought to favor March to inaugurate the part of Willy Loman in the Pulitzer Prize–winning &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1949). However, March read the play and turned down the role, whereupon director Elia Kazan cast Lee J. Cobb as Willy and Arthur Kennedy as one of Willy&#x27;s sons, Biff Loman. Cobb and Kennedy were two actors with whom the director had worked in the film &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1947). March later regretted turning down the role and finally played Willy Loman in Columbia Pictures&#x27;s 1951 film version of the play, directed by Laslo Benedek. March earned his fifth and final Oscar nomination as well as a Golden Globe Award. He also played one of two leads in &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; (1955) with Humphrey Bogart. Bogart and Spencer Tracy had both insisted upon top billing, and Tracy withdrew, leaving the part available for March.

In 1957, March was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for &quot;distinguished contribution to the art of film&quot;.
On February 12, 1959, March appeared before a joint session of the 86th United States Congress, reading the Gettysburg Address as part of a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s birth.

March co-starred with Spencer Tracy in the 1960 Stanley Kramer film &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, in which he played a dramatized version of famous orator and political figure William Jennings Bryan. March&#x27;s Bible-thumping character provided a rival for Tracy&#x27;s Clarence Darrow-inspired character. In the 1960s, March&#x27;s film career continued with a performance as President Jordan Lyman in the political thriller &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964) in which he co-starred with Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, and Edmond O&#x27;Brien; the part earned March a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor.

March made several spoken word recordings, including a version of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; issued in 1945 in which he narrated and played the title role, and &quot;The Sounds of History&quot;, a twelve volume LP set accompanying the twelve volume set of books &quot;The Life History of the United States&quot;, published by Time-Life. The recordings were narrated by Charles Collingwood, with March and his wife Florence Eldridge performing dramatic readings from historical documents and literature.

Following surgery for prostate cancer in 1970, it seemed his career was over; yet, he managed to give one last performance in &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; (1973) as the complicated Irish saloon keeper, Harry Hope.

==Marriage and public activities==
March was married to actress Florence Eldridge from 1927 until his death in 1975, and they had two adopted children. They appeared in seven films together, the last being &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;.

March and Eldridge commissioned Wallace Neff to build their house in Ridgeview Drive, Bel Air, in 1934. It has subsequently been owned by the philanthropist Wallis Annenberg and the actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston.

Throughout his life, March and Eldridge were supporters of the Democratic Party. In July 1936, March co-founded the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League (HANL), along with the writers Dorothy Parker and Donald Ogden Stewart, the director Fritz Lang, and the composer Oscar Hammerstein.

In 1938, March was one of many Hollywood personalities who were investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and the hunt for Communists in the film community. In July 1940, he was among a number of individuals who were questioned by a HUAC subcommittee which was led by Representative Martin Dies Jr.

Later, in 1948, he and his wife sued the anti-communist publication &quot;Counterattack&quot; for defamation, seeking $250,000 in damages. The suit was settled out of court.

March died of prostate cancer in Los Angeles on April 14, 1975, at the age of 77. He was buried at his estate in New Milford, Connecticut.

==Legacy==

=== Modern assessment ===
March is regarded as one of the most eminent Hollywood actors of the 1930s and 1940s. Critic and Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz opined that &quot;two actors from Hollywood’s golden age really stand in a tier above the rest ... Spencer Tracy and Fredric March&quot;. Boston Globe writer Joan Wickersham described March as a Hollywood great who &quot;rejected the Hollywood studio system&quot; and &quot;built a brilliant stage and film career&quot; despite lacking the &quot;instant name recognition&quot; of contemporaries like Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant. March is also remembered for his later character roles such as those in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;, and &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, roles he played during what was considered a downturn in his film career at the time.

=== Controversy ===
March was briefly a member of an interfraternity society composed of leading students formed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1919 and 1920 named the Ku Klux Klan which is not believed to have been affiliated with the notorious organization of that name. In actuality, March was an outspoken proponent of the civil rights movement for five decades, and worked closely with the NAACP. When the collegiate organization was named, the (later national) KKK was a small regional organization. As the national KKK became better known, the collegiate organization changed its name in 1922.

False rumors based on a misunderstanding of the organization of which March was a member were spread on social media and alleged that March was a white supremacist. The 500-seat theater at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh was formerly named after March. The University of Wisconsin–Madison had named the 168-seat at the Memorial Union as the Fredric March Play Circle Theater; however, in 2018, his name was removed, after student protests following reports of March&#x27;s membership in a student fraternal organization calling itself Ku Klux Klan. UW–Oshkosh pulled March&#x27;s name from what is now the Theatre Arts Center shortly before the 2020–21 academic term. After new revelations about the nature of the KKK fraternity, as of autumn 2022, there were discussions for a return of March&#x27;s name.

<text>Amateur telescope making is the activity of building telescopes as a hobby, as opposed to being a paid professional. Amateur telescope makers (sometimes called ATMs) build their instruments for personal enjoyment of a technical challenge, as a way to obtain an inexpensive or personally customized telescope, or as a research tool in the field of astronomy. Amateur telescope makers are usually a sub-group in the field of amateur astronomy.

==Beginnings==
Ever since Galileo Galilei adapted a Dutch invention for astronomical use, astronomical telescope making has been an evolving discipline. Many astronomers after the time of Galileo built their own telescopes out of necessity, but the advent of amateurs in the field building telescopes for their own enjoyment and education seems to have come into prominence in the 20th century.

Before the advent of modern mass-produced telescopes, the price of even a modest instrument was often beyond the means of an aspiring amateur astronomer. Building your own was the only economical method to obtain a suitable telescope for observing. Many published works piqued interest in building telescopes, such as the 1920 book &quot;The Amateur&#x27;s Telescope&quot; by Irish telescope maker Rev. W. F. A. Ellison.

In the United States in the early 1920s, articles in &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot; by Russell W. Porter and in &quot;Scientific American&quot; by Albert G. Ingalls featuring Porter and the &quot;Springfield Telescope Makers&quot; helped expand interest in the hobby. There was so much public interest, Ingalls began a regular column for &quot;Scientific American&quot; on the subject (spawning that publications &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; column) and later compiled into three books titled &quot;Amateur Telescope Making&quot; Vol. 1–3. These had a large readership of enthusiast (sometimes called &quot;telescope nuts&quot;) constructing their own instruments. Between 1933 and 1990, &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; magazine ran a regular column called &quot;Gleanings for ATMs&quot; edited by Earle Brown, Robert E. Cox, and Roger Sinnott. The ready supply of surplus optical components after World War II and later Sputnik and the Space Race also greatly expanded the hobby.

==Common amateur designs==

Although the types of telescopes that amateurs build vary widely, including Refractors, Schmidt–Cassegrains and Maksutovs, the most popular telescope design is the Newtonian reflector, described by Russell W. Porter as &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Telescope&quot;. The Newtonian has the advantage of being a simple design that allows for maximum size for the minimum expense. And since the design employs a single front surface mirror as its objective it only has one surface that has to be ground and polished, as opposed to three for the Maksutov and four for the refractor and the Schmidt–Cassegrain. Typically a Newtonian telescope of aperture is a standard starter project, constructed as a club project or by individuals working from books or from plans found on the Internet.

===Mirror making===

Since the Newtonian reflector is the most common telescope built by amateur telescope makers, large sections of the literature on the subject are devoted to fabrication of the primary mirror. The mirrors start as a flat disk of glass, typically plate glass or borosilicate glass (Pyrex). The disk is carefully ground, polished and figured to an extremely accurate shape, usually a paraboloid. Telescopes with high focal ratios may use spherical mirrors since the difference in the two shapes is insignificant at those ratios. The tools used to achieve this shape can be simple, consisting of a similarly sized glass tool, a series of finer abrasives, and a polishing pitch lap made from a type of tree sap. Through a whole series of random strokes the mirror naturally tends to become spherical in shape. At that point, a variation in polishing strokes is typically used to create and perfect the desired paraboloidal shape.

====Foucault test====

The equipment most amateurs use to test the shape of the mirrors, a Foucault knife-edge test, is, like the tools used to create the surface, simple to fabricate. At its most basic it consists of a light bulb, a piece of tinfoil with a pinhole in it, and a razorblade.
After the mirror is polished out it is placed vertically in a stand. The Foucault tester is set up at a distance close to the mirror&#x27;s radius of curvature. The tester is adjusted so that the returning beam from the pinhole light source is interrupted by the knife edge. Viewing the mirror from behind the knife edge shows a pattern on the mirror surface. If the mirror surface is part of a perfect sphere, the mirror appears evenly lighted across the entire surface. If the mirror is spherical but with defects such as bumps or depressions, the defects appear greatly magnified in height. If the surface is paraboloidal, the mirror looks like a doughnut or lozenge. It is possible to calculate how closely the mirror surface resembles a perfect paraboloid by placing a special mask over the mirror and taking a series of measurements with the tester. This data is then reduced and graphed against an ideal parabolic curve.

Some amateur telescope makers use a similar test called a Ronchi test that replaces the knife edge with a &quot;grating&quot; comprising several fine parallel wires or an etching on a glass plate. Other tests used include the Gaviola or Caustic test which can measure mirrors of fast f/ratio more accurately, and home-brew Interferometric testing made possible in recent years by affordable lasers, digital cameras (such as webcams), and computers.

====Aluminizing or &quot;silvering&quot; the mirror====
Once the mirror surface has the correct shape a very thin coating of a highly reflective material is added to the front surface.

Historically this coating was silver. Silvering was put on the mirror chemically, typically by the mirror maker or user. Silver coatings have higher reflectivity than aluminum but corrode quickly and need replacing after a few months.

Since the 1950s most mirror makers have an aluminum coating applied by a thin-film deposition process (work is done by a firm specializing in the process). Modern coatings usually consist of an aluminum layer overcoated with protective transparent compounds.

The mirror is aluminized by placing it in a vacuum chamber with electrically heated tungsten or nichrome coils that can evaporate aluminum. In a vacuum, the hot aluminum atoms travel in straight lines. When they hit the surface of the mirror, they cool and stick. Some mirror coating shops then evaporate a layer of quartz onto the mirror, whereas others expose it to pure oxygen or air in an oven so that the mirror will form a tough, clear layer of aluminum oxide.

==Telescope design==
The telescopes amateur telescope makers build range from backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful contributions to the field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, astrometry, photometry, comet and asteroid discovery to name just a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing deep sky objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and astrophotography of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the design, size, and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers do not have access to high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford focuser, and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring precision machining.

The difficulty of construction is another factor in an amateur&#x27;s choice of project. For a given design the difficulty of construction grows roughly as the square of the diameter of the objective. For example, a Newtonian telescope of aperture is a moderately easy science fair project. A Newtonian is considered a good compromise size since construction is not difficult and results in an instrument that would be expensive to purchase commercially. A reflecting telescope is difficult, but still within the ability of the average amateur who has had experience building smaller instruments. Amateurs have constructed telescopes as large as across, but usually small groups or astronomy clubs take on such projects.

<text>Anatomical pathology (&quot;Commonwealth&quot;) or anatomic pathology (&quot;U.S.&quot;) is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the macroscopic, microscopic, biochemical, immunologic and molecular examination of organs and tissues. Over the 20th century, surgical pathology has evolved tremendously: from historical examination of whole bodies (autopsy) to a more modernized practice, centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision-making in oncology. Its modern founder was the Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni from Forlì.

Anatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids or tissues. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as general pathology. Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology.

==Differences with clinical pathology==
Anatomic pathology relates to the processing, examination, and diagnosis of surgical specimens by a physician trained in pathological diagnosis. Clinical pathology involves the laboratory analysis of tissue samples and bodily fluids; procedures may include blood sample analysis, urinalysis, stool sample analysis, and analysis of spinal fluid. Clinical pathologists may specialize in a number of areas, including blood banking, clinical chemistry, microbiology, and hematology.

==Skills and procedures==
The procedures used in anatomic pathology include:
* Gross examination – the examination of diseased tissues with the naked eye. This is important especially for large tissue fragments, because the disease can often be visually identified. It is also at this step that the pathologist selects areas that will be processed for histopathology. The eye can sometimes be aided with a magnifying glass or a stereo microscope, especially when examining parasitic organisms.
* Histopathology – the microscopic examination of stained tissue sections using histological techniques. The standard stains are haematoxylin and eosin, but many others exist. The use of haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides to provide specific diagnoses based on morphology is considered to be the core skill of anatomic pathology. The science of staining tissues sections is called histochemistry.
* Immunohistochemistry – the use of antibodies to detect the presence, abundance, and localization of specific proteins. This technique is critical to distinguishing between disorders with similar morphology, as well as characterizing the molecular properties of certain cancers.
* In situ hybridization – Specific DNA and RNA molecules can be identified on sections using this technique. When the probe is labeled with fluorescent dye, the technique is called FISH.
* Cytopathology – the examination of loose cells spread and stained on glass slides using cytology techniques
* Electron microscopy – the examination of tissue with an electron microscope, which allows much greater magnification, enabling the visualization of organelles within the cells. Its use has been largely supplanted by immunohistochemistry, but it is still in common use for certain tasks, including the diagnosis of kidney disease and the identification of immotile cilia syndrome.
* Tissue cytogenetics – the visualization of chromosomes to identify genetic defects such as chromosomal translocation
* Flow immunophenotyping – the determination of the immunophenotype of cells using flow cytometry techniques. It is very useful to diagnose the different types of leukemia and lymphoma.

==Subspecialties==

===Surgical pathology===

Surgical pathology is the most significant and time-consuming area of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by non-surgeons such as general internists, medical subspecialists, dermatologists, and interventional radiologists. Surgical pathology increasingly requires technologies and skills traditionally associated with clinical pathology such as molecular diagnostics.

===Oral and maxillofacial pathology===
In the United States, subspecialty-trained doctors of dentistry, rather than medical doctors, can be certified by a professional board to practice Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology.

===Cytopathology===

Cytopathology is a sub-discipline of anatomical pathology concerned with the microscopic examination of whole, individual cells obtained from exfoliation or fine-needle aspirates. Cytopathologists are trained to perform fine-needle aspirates of superficially located organs, masses, or cysts and are often able to render an immediate diagnosis in the presence of the patient and consulting physician. In the case of screening tests such as the Papanicolaou smear, non-physician cytotechnologists are often employed to perform initial reviews, with only positive or uncertain cases examined by the pathologist. Cytopathology is a board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S.

===Molecular pathology===

Molecular pathology is an emerging discipline within anatomical and clinical pathology that is focused on the use of nucleic acid-based techniques such as in-situ hybridization, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and nucleic acid microarrays for specialized studies of disease in tissues and cells. Molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic and clinical pathology, and is sometimes considered a &quot;crossover&quot; discipline.

===Forensic pathology===

Forensic pathologists receive specialized training in determining the cause of death and other legally relevant information from the bodies of persons who died suddenly with no known medical condition, those who die from non-natural causes, as well as those dying as a result of homicide, or other criminally suspicious deaths. A majority of the forensic pathologists cases are due to natural causes. Often, additional tests such as toxicology, histology, and genetic testing will be used to help the pathologist determine the cause of death. Forensic pathologists will often testify in courts regarding their findings in cases of homicide and suspicious death. They also play a large role in public health, such as investigating deaths in the workplace, deaths in custody, as well as sudden and unexpected deaths in children.
Forensic pathologists often have special areas of interest within their practice, such as sudden death due to cardiac pathology, deaths due to drugs, or Sudden Infant Death (SIDS), and various others.

==Training and certification==

===Australia===
* (Also New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia)
Anatomical Pathology is one of the specialty training programs offered by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA). The RCPA. To qualify as a Fellow of the RCPA in Anatomical Pathology, the candidate must complete a recognised undergraduate or postgraduate medical qualification and then complete a minimum of 2 years of clinical medical experience as a prerequisite to selection as a training registrar. The training program is a minimum of 5 years, served in at least two laboratories, and candidates must pass a Basic Pathological Sciences examination (usually in first year), the Part 1 examinations (not before 3rd year) and the Part 2 examinations (not before 5th year). Fellows may then continue into subspecialty training.

===Canada===
Anatomical Pathology (AP) is one of the specialist certificates granted by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Other certificates related to pathology include general pathology (GP), hematopathology, and neuropathology. Candidates for any of these must have completed four years of medical school and five years of residency training.

===United States===
Anatomic Pathology (AP) is one of the two primary certifications offered by the American Board of Pathology (the other is Clinical Pathology (CP)) and one of three primary certifications offered by the American Osteopathic Board of Pathology. To be certified in anatomic pathology, the trainee must complete four years of medical school followed by three years of residency training. Many U.S. pathologists are certified in both AP and CP, which requires a total of four years of residency. After completing residency, many pathologists enroll in further years of fellowship training to gain expertise in a subspecialty of AP or CP. Pathologists&#x27; Assistants are highly trained medical professionals with specialized training in Anatomic and Forensic pathology. To become a Pathologists&#x27; Assistant one must enter and successfully complete a NAACLS accredited program and pass the ASCP Board of Certification Exam.

==Practice settings==

* &quot;Academic anatomical pathology&quot; is practiced at university medical centers by pathologists who are also university faculty. As such, they often have diverse responsibilities that may include training pathology residents, teaching medical students, conducting basic, clinical, or translational research, or performing administrative duties, all in addition to the practice of diagnostic anatomical pathology. Pathologists in academic settings often sub-specialize in a particular area of anatomic pathology and may serve as consultants to other pathologists regarding cases in their specific area of expertise.
* &quot;Group practice&quot; is the most traditional private practice model. In this arrangement, a group of senior pathologists will control a partnership that employs junior pathologists and contracts independently with hospitals to provide diagnostic services, as well as attracting referral business from local clinicians who practice in the outpatient setting. The group often owns a laboratory for histology and ancillary testing of tissue, and may hold contracts to run hospital-owned labs. Many pathologists who practice in this setting are trained and certified in both anatomical pathology and clinical pathology, which allows them to supervise blood banks, clinical chemistry laboratories, and medical microbiology laboratories as well.
* Large &quot;corporate providers of anatomical pathology services, such as&quot; &quot;AmeriPath&quot; in the United States. In this model, pathologists are employees, rather than independent partners. This model has been criticized for reducing physician independence, but defenders claim that the larger size of these practices allows for economies of scale and greater specialization, as well a sufficient volume to support more specialized testing methods.
* &quot;Multispecialty groups&quot;, composed of physicians from clinical specialties as well as radiology and pathology, are another practice model. In some case, these may be large groups controlled by an HMO or other large health care organization. In others, they are in essence clinician group practices that employ pathologists to provide diagnostic services for the group. These groups may own their own laboratories, or, in some cases may make controversial arrangements with &quot;pod labs&quot; that allow clinician groups to lease space, with the clinician groups receiving direct insurance payments for pathology services. Proposed changes to Medicare regulations may essentially eliminate these arrangements in the United States.

<doc id="63564" wikidata="Q103824" url="?curid=63564" title="Hematology">
<text>Hematology (spelled haematology in British English) is the branch of medicine concerned with the study of the cause, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, blood clots (thrombus), other bleeding disorders, and blood cancers such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. The laboratory analysis of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist.

==Specialization==
Physicians specialized in hematology are known as hematologists or haematologists. Their routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with hematological diseases, although some may also work at the hematology laboratory viewing blood films and bone marrow slides under the microscope, interpreting various hematological test results and blood clotting test results. In some institutions, hematologists also manage the hematology laboratory. Physicians who work in hematology laboratories, and most commonly manage them, are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of hematological diseases, referred to as hematopathologists or haematopathologists. Hematologists and hematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed. Hematology is a distinct subspecialty of internal medicine, separate from but overlapping with the subspecialty of medical oncology. Hematologists may specialize further or have special interests, for example, in:
* treating bleeding disorders such as hemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, with the latter of these two conditions being continuously studied by hematologists due to its unknown cause.
* treating hematological malignancies such as lymphoma and leukemia (cancers)
* treating hemoglobinopathies, including α-thalassemias and β-thalassemias (thalassemia syndromes) and hemoglobin S, hemoglobin C, and hemoglobin E (abnormal hemoglobins).
* the science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bank, known as transfusion medicine
* bone marrow and stem cell transplantation, especially with the use of technologies to extract and isolate hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs).

==Training==
Starting hematologists (in the US) complete a four-year medical degree followed by three or four more years in residency or internship programs. After completion, they further expand their knowledge by spending two or three more years learning how to experiment, diagnose, and treat blood disorders. Some exposure to hematopathology is typically included in their fellowship training. Job openings for hematologists require training in a recognized fellowship program to learn to diagnose and treat numerous blood-related benign conditions and blood cancers. Hematologists typically work across specialties to care for patients with complex illnesses, such as sickle cell disease, who require complex, multidisciplinary care, and to provide consultation on cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombosis and other conditions that can occur in hospitalized patients.

<text>Forensic pathology is pathology that focuses on determining the cause of death by examining a corpse. A post mortem examination is performed by a medical examiner or forensic pathologist, usually during the investigation of criminal law cases and civil law cases in some jurisdictions. Coroners and medical examiners are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of remains.

== Duties ==
Forensic pathology is an application of medical jurisprudence. A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor who has completed training in anatomical pathology and has subsequently specialized in forensic pathology. The requirements for becoming a &quot;fully qualified&quot; forensic pathologist vary from country to country. Some of the different requirements are discussed below.

The forensic pathologist performs autopsies/postmortem examinations with the goal of determining the cause of death as well as the possible manner of death. The autopsy report contains conclusions made relating to the following:
* The pathological process, injury, or disease that directly results in or initiates a series of events that lead to a person&#x27;s death (also called the mechanism of death), such as a bullet wound to the head, exsanguination caused by a stab wound, manual or ligature strangulation, myocardial infarction resulting from coronary artery disease, etc.)
* The manner of death, the circumstances surrounding the cause of death, which, in most jurisdictions, include the following:
** Homicide
** Accidental
** Natural
** Suicide
** Undetermined

The autopsy also provides an opportunity for other issues raised by the death to be addressed, such as the collection of trace evidence or determining the identity of the deceased. Autopsies are performed when a death occurs, when an unexpected death occurs, when someone dies while not under the care of a physician, to solve criminal cases, when a mass disaster occurs and requires the identification of the victims and upon request by the family or loved ones of the deceased. Typically, autopsies can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000, however the price can vary from country to country.

The forensic pathologist examines and documents wounds and injuries, along with the possible causation of those injuries, at autopsy, at the scene of a crime and occasionally in a clinical setting, such as rape investigation or deaths in custody.

Forensic pathologists collect and examine tissue specimens under the microscope (histology) to identify the presence or absence of natural disease and other microscopic findings such as asbestos bodies in the lungs or gunpowder particles around a gunshot wound.

They collect and interpret toxicological specimens of body tissues and fluids to determine the chemical cause of accidental overdoses or deliberate poisonings.

Forensic pathologists work closely with the medico-legal authority for the area concerned with the investigation of sudden and unexpected deaths: the coroner (England and Wales), procurator fiscal (Scotland), or coroner or medical examiner (United States).

In mass disaster settings, forensic pathologists will work alongside Forensic Odontologists, Forensics Anthropologists as well as other forensic specialties with the goal of identifying the victims of the disaster. The process of identification involves the recovery of the victims, the collection of antemortem data, the initial examination along with the collection of any postmortem evidence, and finally the comparison of the antemortem and postmortem data gathered in order to identify those victims.

They serve as expert witnesses in courts of law testifying in civil or criminal law cases.

In an autopsy, the forensic pathologist is often assisted by an autopsy/mortuary technician (sometimes called a diener in the US).

Forensic physicians sometimes referred to as &quot;forensic medical examiners&quot; or &quot;police surgeons&quot; (in the UK until recently), are medical doctors trained in the examination of, and provision of medical treatment to, living victims of assault, including sexual assault, and individuals who find themselves in police custody. Many forensic physicians in the UK practice clinical forensic medicine part-time, and they also practice family medicine or another medical specialty.

In the United Kingdom, membership of the Royal College of Pathologists is not a prerequisite of appointment as a coroner&#x27;s &quot;medical expert&quot;. Doctors in the UK who are not forensic pathologists or pathologists are allowed to perform medicolegal autopsies, as the wording of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which merely stipulates a &quot;registered medical practitioner&quot;: anyone on the General Medical Council register.

Forensic pathologists make great contributions to public health and preventative medicine by studying the dead. By using their findings during autopsies, they can use their knowledge to prevent the death of another person.

== Investigation of death ==

Pathologists determine the cause of death through postmortem examination or autopsy. There are three stages of death investigation: examination, correlation, and interpretation. Deaths where there is an unknown cause and those considered unnatural are investigated. In most jurisdictions this is done by a &quot;&quot;forensic pathologist&quot;,&quot; &quot;coroner&quot;, &quot;medical examiner&quot;, or hybrid &quot;medical examiner-coroner&quot; offices.

=== Methods ===
Forensic pathologists must be trained in several fields to succeed at their job. They utilize a wide variety of methods such as conducting autopsies which in itself has a variety of methods. Some of these methods require various identification techniques, including immunohistological studies, which can be valuable for determining the time of injury and assessing axonal damage resulting from traumatic brain injury When conducting an autopsy a forensic pathologist may take X-Rays, samples of bodily fluids, samples of tissues, and samples of bacterial culture found within the body. While conducting the autopsy the forensic pathologist uses the stages of death as another method to inspect both the time of death and the amount of time the body has been deceased. Using the Information received during the autopsy paired with evidence provided by law enforcement provides the basis for the determination of the cause of death.

=== Terminology inconsistencies across jurisdictions ===
In some jurisdictions, the title of &quot;Medical Examiner&quot; is used by a non-physician, elected official involved in a medicolegal death investigation. In others, the law requires the medical examiner to be a physician, pathologist, or forensic pathologist.

Similarly, the title &quot;coroner&quot; is applied to both physicians and non-physicians. Historically, coroners were not all physicians (most often serving primarily as the town mortician). However, in some jurisdictions, the topic of &quot;Coroner&quot; is exclusively used by physicians.

=== Canadian coroners ===
In Canada, there was a mix of coroner and medical examiner systems, depending on the province or territory. In Ontario, coroners are licensed physicians, usually but not exclusively family physicians. In Quebec, there is a mix of medical and non-medical coroners, whereas, in British Columbia, there is predominantly a non-physician coroner system. Alberta and Nova Scotia are examples of ME systems

=== Coroners and medical examiners in the United States ===
In the United States, a coroner is typically an elected public official in a particular geographic jurisdiction who investigates and certifies deaths. The vast majority of coroners lack a Doctor of Medicine degree and the amount of medical training that they have received is highly variable, depending on their profession (e.g. law enforcement, judges, funeral directors, emergency medical technicians, nurses).

In contrast, a medical examiner is typically a physician who holds the degree of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.). Ideally, a medical examiner has completed both a pathology residency and a fellowship in forensic pathology. In some jurisdictions, a medical examiner must be both a doctor and a lawyer, with additional training in forensic pathology.

== History ==
Forensic pathology was founded by Rudolf Virchow, a German pathologist, who developed the Virchow method which is one of the main and popular techniques still used by forensic pathologists today. The Virchow method is of doing autopsies as well as instituting cell theory which would shed light on the effects and damage of disease on the human body. Rudolf Virchow began the practice of regulated autopsies where the entire body would be inspected rather than a particular area of interest which would expose additional damage that injuries and ailments inflicted on the human body. In German-speaking Europe, lectures on forensic pathology were regularly held in Freiburg in the mid 18th century and Vienna in 1804. Scientists like Auguste Ambroise Tardieu, Johann Ludwig Casper and Carl Liman made great efforts to develop forensic pathology into a science based on empirics.

Ambroise Paré is also considered one of the fathers of modern forensic pathology and surgery. His inventions in the early 16th century include surgical instruments and techniques. He pioneered battlefield medicine and treatments of wounds. One technique he used was pouring boiling oil into wounds.

This history of forensic pathology can be traced all the way back to the fourth century BC in Babylonia but instead of practicing on deceased human bodies, the practice of forensic pathology was strictly practiced on animals. This was said to be done only to animals since humans during this era were believed to be sacred. Later on, in forensic pathology history, forensic pathology would be practiced among those who live in Asia. Muslim doctors would discover infectious diseases and as a result, would operate on deceased bodies; one of those doctors being Ibn Zuhr. Zuhr would go on to performing autopsies on bodies in postmortem and research diseases such as leprosy, mange, and sexually transmitted diseases.

While Zuhr was busy learning about contagious diseases, Yee Siung, a Chinese government official was assembling a group of physicians who were in charge of dissecting criminal murder victims. These victims’ cause of death would be investigated alongside the actual case itself and this would be the first time pathology would be used to help solve criminal cases.

Forensic pathology was first recognized in the United States by the American Board of Pathology in 1959 after toxicology and pathology had been used to solve thousands of criminal cases worldwide for years.

In Canada, it was formally recognized in 2003, and a formal training program (a fellowship) is currently being established under the auspices of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

== Education ==
In most English speaking countries, forensic pathology is a subspecialty of anatomical pathology. Training requirements differ from country to country, however, it is common for pathologists to study at a medical school and then go on to study pathology. Many forensic pathologists practice as a histo (hospital) pathologists before moving onto forensic science. Another requirement for forensic pathologists includes having a working knowledge of specific fields of study like toxicology, firearms examination (wound ballistics), trace evidence, forensic serology and DNA technology.

=== Australia ===
There are currently three paths to qualify as a forensic pathologist in Australia. The first is to train solely in forensic pathology (although a significant amount of anatomical pathology knowledge is still required) and pass two examinations for forensic pathology only. The second is to commence training in anatomical pathology, and complete an initial anatomical pathology examination, which takes a minimum of three years; then go on to train solely in forensic pathology and complete a forensic pathology examination, which takes a minimum of two years. The third is to complete a minimum 5 years&#x27; training in anatomical pathology to qualify as a fellow in anatomical pathology, then complete a post-fellowship year in forensic pathology (a minimum twelve months further training plus successful completion of an examination).

=== Canada ===
In Canada, individuals must complete an undergraduate science degree, followed by a doctor of medicine degree from one of the seven medical schools in Canada. After these are completed individuals may enter the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (RCPSC) which requires the completion of residency training. Anatomical pathology is a five-year residency. Residents who wish to become forensic pathologists must then complete a one-year fellowship in forensic pathology. Forensic pathology is a sub-specialty by the RCPSC. As of 2022, there are three schools in Canada that offer the forensic pathology training program. These schools are the University of Alberta, the University of Ottawa and the University of Toronto. McMaster University ceased their training program in 2019.

=== Germany ===
Once students have acquired the &quot;Abitur&quot; diploma and completed all the requirements, they can study medicine at a university. Within the medical education system, there are four subdivisions individuals must partake in prior to moving into a specialization.

The first section is a two year preclinical study period where individuals are introduced to the basics. A two month work period at a hospital must be completed between each semester in order to become familiar with everyday life in a hospital. A final exam on the basics concludes this portion.

The second section is a one year clinical period to familiarize the students with the basics of clinical practice. The students complete the first part of the physician&#x27;s exam at the end of this period.

The third section is another clinical period which lasts for two years, which practices non-surgical, surgical, neurological, ecological and general medicine domains. Here is where forensic medicine is first introduced. Between the first and second clinical sections, four months of medical clerkship are required, which consists of two months in a hospital and two months at any other medical institution. Students complete the second part of the physician&#x27;s exam at the end of this period.

The final section is a one year practical period where students partake in three 4 month practicums: four months of internal medicine, four months of surgery and four months of clinical practical study of their choice. Students write the final part of the physician&#x27;s exam before this period and have the oral part afterwards.

Once individuals have completed their medical studies, there is a minimum of six extra years of specialization training for forensic pathology. During this training individuals must complete at least three years and six months working for a legal medicine institution, focusing on clinical forensic pathology training. Then, at least one year of pathology work at a specialized institute is required partaking in autopsy technical training. As well, a minimum of 6 months working with forensic psychiatrists is also required. Finally, a single year of work in any field of medicine or legal medicine must be completed. During these work periods, it is required that these physicians write a number of opinions on their post-mortem examinations, crime scene investigations, crime scene reconstructions and insurance medical cases. There is also a minimum number of reports consisting of their own autopsies, police inquiries, histological investigation and other investigative results. Finally, the practicing physician must complete a certain number of oral court proceedings. Once all of this has been completed, an oral examination, overseen by the Chamber of Physicians (also known as the German Medical Association) is to be completed which allows individuals to officially become a forensic pathologist upon completion.

=== India ===
In India, the specialty is commonly referred to as Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, or Legal Medicine. After completion of medical graduation (MBBS), one has to complete three years of study and training including thesis research, which leads to the award of a degree of MD (Forensic Medicine). One can also alternately pass the board examination conducted by the National Board of Examinations , leading to awarding of Diplomate of National Board (DNB).

The majority of the specialists are attached to the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology in various medical colleges. The classification of posts includes Assistant Professor (Lecturer), Associate Professor (Reader), and Professor. The work profile of the specialists includes conducting autopsies and clinical forensic examinations; apart from teaching the medical students. They have to regularly appear in the courts as expert witnesses. A typical department in a government institution conducts 100 to 5,000 autopsies a year depending upon the jurisdiction. Apart from this, clinical forensic examinations constitute a major part of the work and the number of cases can run up to ten thousand a year in an average institution.

The largest association of the specialty is Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine (IAFM), which also publishes its quarterly Journal of Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine regularly. This association has a specialist member strength of more than 1000.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, forensic medicine, also known as legal medicine (&quot;kedokteran kehakiman&quot;), is a 3-year specialty program that can be taken directly after completing medical school. It is separate from anatomical pathology and clinical pathology. Upon completion of the program, a forensic medicine specialist will obtain the title &quot;Spesialis Forensik&quot;, or &quot;Sp.F&quot;. He or she may be addressed in public as &quot;Dokter Forensik&quot; (&quot;forensic doctor&quot;). Note that there is no pre-medicine program, making the total duration of formal education for one to become a forensic specialist 9 years. It was first introduced through the Dutch colonial criminal justice system in the early twentieth century.

Forensic medicine is also a mandatory round during medical school clerkship. Medical students assist the doctors on autopsies, and they may also be allowed to perform an autopsy under supervision, and to witness in the court.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, the profession of forensic pathology is not commonly pursued compared to other medical professions such as clinicians and doctors. In Japan, there are 33 of 42 universities that have a department of pathology established on their campuses yet, even so, only  21 of the 42 universities offer residency programs pertaining to forensic pathology.

To become a forensic pathologist, it requires individuals to pursue a four year undergraduate degree. After completing their undergraduate career, it is then required for individuals to attend medical school to either earn their Masters or Doctorates degree. After completing medical school, individuals are then required to have 2 years of mandatory postgraduate clinical education where they learn important clinical skills such as communication skills, common laboratory procedures such as Gram’s stain and urinalysis. When the two year mandatory clinical training is completed, another 3-4 years of training is needed to focus more on surgical procedures which is especially for forensic pathologists. During these last 3–4 years of training, forensic pathologists will learn more about specified human anatomy and they will also have the chance to interact with real patients as well as interacting with other forensic pathologists as well. The department of Forensic Medicine at Kyoto University in Japan has a legacy that can be traced back to 1899 when the department of forensic was first founded. The department has been active forces in promoting the significance of forensic medicine through its innovative programs, research, and analysis.

When their training is completed, forensic pathologists in Japan will then have the opportunity to receive their certificate of pathology awarded by the Japanese Society of Pathology

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, forensic histopathology is a five/five and a half year training programme, consisting of two and half years of histopathology followed by two and half/three years of forensic histopathology. Successful candidates are eligible for inclusion on the specialist register of the General Medical Council (GMC), which is a requirement to work as a consultant forensic pathologist.

Entry to forensic histopathology specialty training requires completion of the UK Foundation Programme, stages A and B of histopathology specialty training, and a pass in the FRCPath Part 1 examination in histopathology. Candidates are in year 3 of specialty training (ST3) when entering forensic histopathology and progress immediately to stage C. Completion of stages C and D, and a pass in the FRCPath Part 2 examination in forensic histopathology allow the candidate to apply for the Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT).

Another option is to obtain the full FRCPath in general histopathology, followed by another 18–24 months of training in forensic pathology, which will qualify the candidates with either the Diploma of the Royal College of Pathologists in Forensic Pathology (DipRCPath (forensic)) or the Diploma in Medical Jurisprudence (DMJ). In England and Wales, the candidate will also need to be Home Office Accredited, which will require checks of the training portfolio and completion of a security check and the Expert Witness Training Course run by the Forensic Science Service.

Currently approved centres for forensic pathology training in the UK include Belfast, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leicester, Cardiff, London, Glasgow and Dundee. Not all the posts are currently actively training.

=== United States ===
In the United States, forensic pathologists typically complete at least one year of additional training (a fellowship) after completing an anatomical pathology residency and having passed the &quot;board&quot; examination administered by The American Board of Pathology or The American Osteopathic Board of Pathology (&quot;board-certified&quot;). Becoming an anatomic pathologist in the United States requires completing a residency in anatomic pathology, which is on-the-job training one must perform upon completing medical school before one may practice unsupervised. &quot;Anatomic pathology&quot; (as it is called) by itself is a three-year residency. Most U.S. pathologists complete a combined residency in both anatomic and &quot;clinical pathology&quot;, which requires a total of four years.

In the United States, all told, the education after high school is typically 13–15 years in duration (4 years of undergraduate training + 4 years of medical school + 4–5 years of residency [anatomic and clinical pathology combined] + 1–2 years of forensic pathology fellowship). Generally, the biggest hurdle is gaining admission to medical school, although the pass rate for anatomic and forensic pathology board examinations (in the U.S.) is approximately 80-90 and 90-100 percent, respectively. The courts do not require the American Board of Pathology certification in order for a witness to be qualified as an expert in the field of forensic pathology, and there are several &quot;diploma mills&quot; that give online certificates in the field.

<doc id="63567" wikidata="Q207284" url="?curid=63567" title="Mount Ruapehu">
<text>Mount Ruapehu (; English ) is an active stratovolcano at the southern end of the Taupō Volcanic Zone and North Island volcanic plateau in New Zealand. It is northeast of Ohakune and southwest of the southern shore of Lake Taupō, within the Tongariro National Park. The North Island&#x27;s major ski resorts and only glaciers are on its slopes.

Ruapehu, the largest active volcano in New Zealand, has the highest point in the North Island and has three major peaks: Tahurangi (2,797 m), Te Heuheu (2,755 m) and Paretetaitonga (2,751 m). The deep, active crater is between the peaks and fills with water between major eruptions, being known as Crater Lake (). The name &quot;Ruapehu&quot; means &quot;pit of noise&quot; or &quot;exploding pit&quot; in Māori.

==Geography==

Ruapehu is located in the centre of the North Island of New Zealand, northeast of Ohakune, New Zealand and southwest of the southern shore of Lake Taupō, within Tongariro National Park. Ruapehu is the largest and southernmost volcano in the national park, with an estimated volume of 110 km3. The volcano is surrounded by a ring plain of volcanic material, made from lahar deposits, ash fall, and landslide debris.

There are three access routes to Ruapehu, and each access route leads to one of the three skifields that are found on its slopes. State Highway 48 leads to Whakapapa Village at the base of the mountain, and from there an access road leads up the mountain to Iwikau Village at the base of the Whakapapa skifield on the northwestern bumpy hilly slopes. An access road from Ohakune leads to Turoa skifield on the southwestern slopes, and a four-wheel drive track leads from the Desert Road (State Highway 1) to the Tukino skifield on the eastern slopes.

Ruapehu&#x27;s active crater, dubbed Crater Lake (Te Wai ā-moe), is situated at the southern end of the Summit Plateau, and as the name suggests, is filled with a warm, acidic lake. The lake&#x27;s outlet is at the head of the Whangaehu Valley, where the Whangaehu River arises. The Whangaehu River is notorious for destructive lahars caused by Ruapehu&#x27;s eruptions. In historic times, eruptions have built tephra dams across the outlet on several occasions, most recently in 1945 and 1996. These dams failed in 1953 and 2007 respectively, causing an outburst of Crater Lake each time, which sent destructive lahars down the river. The 1953 lahar was the cause of the Tangiwai disaster, in which 151 people died. Even larger lahars occurred in 1862 and 1895.

===Glaciers===

A total of 18 glaciers have been recognised on Ruapehu, of which six are named. Two glaciers are found in the active crater: one on the north side of the crater under Paretetaitonga Peak and another one to the south, and these are New Zealand&#x27;s only crater glaciers. Most of the ice on Ruapehu is contained in only three of its glaciers: the Whangaehu, Summit Plateau, and Mangatoetoenui glaciers. The Summit Plateau glacier is not a glacier in the true sense, but rather an ice field that fills an extinct volcanic crater, and the ice there reaches more than 130 m thick. The Whangaehu glacier feeds the Whangaehu River, and the Mangatoetoenui glacier is one of the principal sources of the Waikato River, which arises as a series of streams on Ruapehu&#x27;s eastern slopes. On the western side of the mountain, many of the streams that arise there, such as the Whakapapa and Manganui o te Ao rivers, feed the Whanganui River.
Ruapehu&#x27;s glaciers are situated at the northern limit for the formation of permanent ice in New Zealand, and thus they are extremely sensitive to changes in climate. Surveys of the glaciers undertaken since 1955 have found that the glaciers have all been thinning and retreating, with the exception of the northern crater glacier, which thickened and lengthened after the 1953 outburst of Crater Lake lowered the lake water level.

===Climate===

Ruapehu has a polar tundra climate (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;) on the upper slopes, with average temperatures ranging from −4–15 °C in summer and −7–7 °C in winter, depending on elevation and cloudiness. On the lower slopes, Ruapehu has a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfc&quot;).

The prevalent wind direction in the region is westerly or northwesterly, and gale force conditions (i.e. wind speeds higher than ) are common on the mountain. Rainfall is higher on the western flanks of Ruapehu than the eastern flanks due to the rain shadow effect. Whakapapa Village receives an average of 2,200 mm of rain per year, whereas the Rangipo Desert to the east of Ruapehu receives slightly more than 1,500 mm of rain annually. Snow falls on average as low as 1,500 m elevation.

===Severe weather incidents===

Weather conditions can be changeable over the day, and mountain visitors are advised to be prepared and carry basic survival equipment. Severe weather has claimed several lives over the years, including a party of five NZ Army soldiers and one RNZN naval rating, caught in a week-long storm while undergoing winter survival training in 1990. The same storm also trapped an experienced Japanese mountaineer when the weather unexpectedly closed in on him, but he built a snow cave and sheltered in it until he was rescued days later.

Extreme weather conditions have caused visitors to be trapped on the mountain in the past. In 2003, about 350 visitors to Whakapapa skifield and 70 staff had to stay overnight in various lodges at Iwikau village (small village at the top of mountain road) after a snow storm made the road too dangerous to descend. In 2008 extreme weather resulted in about 2000 visitors being evacuated from Whakapapa skifield, with cars being led down the mountain in groups of five. About 100 cars were left at the skifield overnight.

==Geology==

Ruapehu is a composite andesitic stratovolcano located at the southern end of the Taupō Volcanic Zone and forming part of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre. Volcanism at Ruapehu is caused by the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Australian Plate at the Hikurangi Trough to the east of the North Island. Ruapehu has erupted from multiple craters over its lifetime, however, only one crater is presently active, a deep crater at the southern end of the summit plateau which is filled with hot, acidic water, dubbed Crater Lake (Te Wai ā-moe). The lake water currently covers separate north and central vents.

Ruapehu sits on a basement of Mesozoic greywacke overlain by a thin layer of sediments of the Wanganui Basin, composed of sands, silts, shell beds, and limestone. It has not been clearly established when Ruapehu first began erupting, only that eruptions began at least 250,000 years ago and possibly as early as 340,000 years ago. Ruapehu has been built in four distinct stages of relatively intense eruptive activity followed by periods of relative quiet. Each of these four stages of activity has left behind distinct rock formations, named the Te Herenga Formation (erupted 250,000–180,000 years ago), the Wahianoa Formation (erupted 160,000–115,000 years ago), the Mangawhero Formation (erupted 55,000–15,000 years ago), and the Whakapapa Formation (erupted 15,000–2,000 years ago). Each of these rock formations is composed of lava flows and tuff breccias, and studies of these formations has revealed how volcanic activity at Ruapehu has developed over time. During the Te Herenga stage of activity, magma rose quickly through the crust during eruptions. However, by 160,000 years ago a complex network of magma dikes and sills had formed in the crust under the volcano, and lava erupted since that time shows signs of extensive mixing between different magma chambers prior to eruptions.
In modern times, volcanic activity has been centred on Crater Lake. There are two active vents under the lake, dubbed North Vent and Central Vent. Activity is characterized by cyclic heating and cooling of the lake over periods of 6–12 months. Each heating cycle is marked by increased seismic activity under the crater and is accompanied by increased emission of volcanic gases, indicating that the vents under Crater Lake are open to gas escape. Evidence suggests that an open-vent system such as this has been in place throughout Ruapehu&#x27;s 250,000 year history. This prevents build-up of pressure and results in relatively small, frequent eruptions (every 20–30 years on average) at Ruapehu compared to other andesitic volcanoes around the world.

Crater Lake is emptied by major eruptions, such as the ones in 1945 and 1995–1996, but refills after eruptions subside, fed by melting snow and vented steam. In historic times, major eruptions have deposited a tephra dam across the lake&#x27;s outlet, preventing lake overflow into the Whangaehu valley. The dam collapses after several years causing a large lahar down the valley. The tephra dam created by the 1945 eruptions collapsed on 24 December 1953, sending a lahar down the Whangaehu River and causing the Tangiwai disaster. 151 people died when the lahar swept away the Tangiwai railway bridge just before an express train crossed it. Another dam was deposited by the 1995–1996 eruptions, which collapsed on 18 March 2007. A warning system, the Eastern Ruapehu Lahar Alarm and Warning System (ERLAWS) system began operation on the mountain in 2002 to detect such a collapse and alert the relevant authorities. The ERLAWS system detected the 2007 lahar, and roads were closed and railway traffic stopped until the lahar had subsided.

===Early eruptive history===

The earliest known volcanic activity in Tongariro National Park was approximately 933,000 ± 46,000 years ago at Hauhungatahi, northwest of Ruapehu. Subsequently, andesitic clasts found 100 km southwest of Ruapehu, near Whanganui, demonstrate that volcanism was likely present in the Ruapehu area 340,000 years ago. However, the oldest rocks on Ruapehu itself are approximately 250,000 years old. Eruptions during this period are believed to have built a steep volcanic cone around a central crater, which would have been located somewhere near the present-day upper Pinnacle Ridge. Cone-building eruptions ceased about 180,000 years ago, and the cone began to be eroded away by glacial action. Rock formations that date to this period are collectively named the Te Herenga Formation, and today these formations be seen at Pinnacle Ridge, Te Herenga Ridge, and Whakapapanui Valley, all on the northwestern slopes of Ruapehu.

Approximately 160,000 years ago, cone-building eruptions began again, this time from a crater that is thought to have lain northwest of present-day Mitre Peak (Ringatoto)—southeast of the original Te Herenga vent. Eruptions continued until approximately 115,000 years ago, and the lava erupted during this period is known as the Wahianoa Formation. This formation has also been heavily eroded by glacial activity, and it now forms the southeastern flanks of modern Ruapehu. The formation consists of lava flows and tuff breccias.

Beginning approximately 55,000 years ago, a third phase of cone-building eruptions began, creating the Mangawhero Formation. This formation was erupted onto the eroded Wahianoa Formation in two phases: the first occurring 55,000–45,000 years ago and the second 30,000–15,000 years ago. Multiple summit craters were active during this period, all lying between Tahurangi and the northern summit plateau. Parasitic eruptions also occurred at Pukeonake, a scoria cone to the north-west of Ruapehu and at several isolated craters near Ohakune. The Mangawhero Formation can be found over most of modern Ruapehu, and it forms most of the mountain&#x27;s high peaks as well as the Turoa skifield.

===Holocene activity===


Lava flows that have been erupted from Ruapehu since the last glacial maximum are called the Whakapapa Formation. These flows all erupted between 15,000 and 2,000 years ago from a number of different craters on the summit of Ruapehu as well as from craters on the northern and southern flanks of the mountain. Rangataua on the southern flanks had a large lava flow between 15,000 and 10,000 years ago.

Approximately 10,000 years ago, a series of major eruptions occurred, not just on Ruapehu, but also at the Tama Lakes between Ruapehu and Tongariro volcanoes. This period of intense eruptions is called the Pahoka-Mangamate event and is thought to have lasted between 200 and 400 years. On Ruapehu, lava was erupted from Saddle Cone—a flank crater on the northern slopes—and from another crater on the southern slopes. This southern crater erupted three times, and lava flows from this crater travelled nearly 14 km to the south.

There is evidence that a sector collapse on the northwestern slopes about 9,400 years ago formed the amphitheatre that now comprises the Whakapapa skifield and left an extensive avalanche deposit on the northwestern ring plain that can still be seen today. Since then eruptions have been an order of magnitude lower in intensity and volume. Accordingly, most of the cone and ring-plain is older than 10,000 years. Eruptions between 10,000 and 2,500 years ago generated lava flows that all flowed into the Whakapapa amphitheatre and created the slopes of the modern skifield.

For the past 2,000 years, activity at Ruapehu has been largely focused through a crater lake at the summit. Eruptive activity has typically consisted of relatively small but explosive phreatomagmatic eruptions occurring every few decades and lasting several months each. The eruptive record is only well understood from tephra deposits before 1950 for 1718 years from the Taupō Hatepe eruption in 232 CE. Over this period there are 30 assigned tephra units by composition studies to Ruapehu and in the 370 years before 1950 the mean time between these months of eruptive period was 40 years.

In recorded history, these eruptions have occurred about 50 years apart, in 1895 (lahar), 1945 and 1995–1996. Minor phreatic or hydrothermal eruptions occur every few years on average, with notable minor eruptions occurring in 1969, 1975, and 2007. More than 600 eruptive events of various sizes have been documented since 1830.

===1945 eruptions and 1953 lahar===

Ruapehu entered an eruptive phase in March 1945 after several weeks of volcanic tremors. The first indication of an eruption was reported on 8 March, with ashfall seen on the eastern slopes. A lava dome was observed in Crater Lake on 19 March but was destroyed in a series of explosive eruptions over the following week. A second, larger lava dome appeared in May, which continued to grow over the following months and had emptied Crater Lake of water by July.

Eruptions increased from August through November. A particularly powerful eruption in the early hours of 21 August was heard in Hawkes Bay and the Tararua District, loud enough to awaken people from sleep and cause alarm. Eruptions began declining in December and had ended by January.

The eruptions dispersed ash across most of the North Island, and eruption columns could be seen from as far afield as Palmerston North, Whanganui, and Hawkes Bay. Ash caused disruption to several North Island communities, entering houses, causing eye and throat irritation, and damaging paintwork on cars. Crop damage was reported in Ohakune, and the water supply at Taumarunui was disrupted.

After eruptions subsided in late December, Crater Lake slowly began refilling, with a &quot;boiling lake&quot; already filling the bottom of the crater by mid-January. A tephra dam had formed at the lake&#x27;s normal outlet during the eruptions, which eventually collapsed on 24 December 1953 causing a lahar that led to the Tangiwai disaster with the loss of 151 lives when the Tangiwai railway bridge across the Whangaehu River collapsed while the lahar was in full flood, just before an express train crossed it.

===1969 and 1975 eruptions===

Ruapehu saw a period of heightened activity between 1966 and 1982, with multiple small eruptions occurring in Crater Lake and two larger eruptions in 1969 and 1975, which ejected rocks across the summit region and produced significant lahars.

The eruption in 1969 occurred in the early hours of 22 June. It was a moderate phreatic eruption, which blasted rocks up to 1 km northwest of the crater and sent lahars down several valleys. The Whakapapa skifield was left covered in mud. This was the largest eruption since 1945.

A larger phreatic eruption occurred at 3:59 a.m. on 24 April 1975, blasting rocks up to 1.6 km northwest of the crater, against the wind, and depositing ash more than 100 km to the southeast. Nine minutes of seismic activity preceded the eruption, but crater dilation had been measured two weeks earlier. Nearly half of the water in Crater Lake was erupted into the air, which subsequently rained down onto the summit, generating lahars down several river valleys. Lahars which travelled down the Whakapapa and Manganui o te Ao rivers entered the Whanganui River and poisoned it, which affected much of the aquatic life downstream. Additionally, the lahars damaged ski installations on the Whakapapa ski field, several bridges and hydroelectric tunnel intakes, but no loss of life occurred.

Three days later, on the morning of 27 April, Ruapehu erupted again. A series of five eruptions occurred between 7:10 a.m. and 10:18 a.m., sending surges of mud, rocks, and ash northwards across the summit plateau and producing eruption columns up to 500 m high.

The 1975 eruptions deepened Crater Lake from 55 to 60 m to more than 90 m.

===1995–1996 eruptions===

Earthquake swarms to the west of Ruapehu between November 1994 and September 1995 marked the beginning of renewed heightened activity at the volcano. Bursts of earthquake activity immediately preceded rapid rises in the temperature of Crater Lake, with the surface temperature reaching 51.4 °C in January 1995—one of the highest temperatures recorded in 30 years and about 10 °C higher than its usual peak temperature. A minor eruption occurred on 26 April, which sent waves against the walls of the crater and damaged some monitoring equipment there. A second eruption on 29 June destroyed the equipment and produced a lahar. Chemical analysis showed that magma was interacting with water under the lake.

The first significant eruption took place at 8:05 a.m. on 18 September 1995, raining tephra onto the summit region and sending lahars down the mountain. On 23 September, an even larger eruption blasted rocks up to 1.5 km from the crater, sent lahars down three valleys, and generated an eruption column 12 km high. Phreatomagmatic eruptions occurred through the rest of the month and throughout October, with some eruptions continuing for hours at a time. Ash fell up to 250 km downwind. Explosive eruptions on 11 October emptied Crater Lake of water.
Following this, activity died off until 15 June 1996 when renewed seismic activity was recorded. This was followed by eruptions on 17 and 18 June which once again emptied the partially refilled Crater Lake of water. Strombolian eruptions occurred on 27 June and throughout July and August, producing eruption columns more than 10 km high and shooting rocks 1.4 km from the crater.

These eruptions produced more than 7 million tonnes of ash, which contaminated water supplies, destroyed crops, and led to the deaths of livestock. Ash in the Tongariro River also damaged the intake turbines at the Rangipo power station, and ash clouds caused airport closures as far away as Auckland and Wellington. The eruptions also caused closures to the three ski fields on the mountain, costing the region an estimated $100 million in lost revenue. During the 1995–1996 summer period between the eruptions, Ruapehu Alpine Lifts ran its chairlifts up the mountain and organised guided tours to within 500 metres of the crater. Hundreds of tourists visited, even though the volcano was still emitting steam and toxic sulphur gas and the Department of Conservation was warning that further eruptions were possible.

Both the 1995 and 1996 eruptions were filmed and streamed to the internet via a custom-built &#x27;volcano-cam&#x27;, possibly the first such camera in the world. The website hosting the feed during the 1996 eruption received up to 4000 hits an hour.

=== Lahar danger ===
After the 1996 eruption it was recognised that a catastrophic lahar could again occur when Crater Lake burst the volcanic ash dam blocking the lake outlet as it did in 1953. In 1997, the government proposed digging a trench through the blockage in the wall of Crater Lake, but this was plan was opposed by conservation groups and Māori. A Ngāti Rangi spokesman noted that the mountain was sacred, and said: &quot;as far as we are concerned if these things [lahars] do happen well we step aside. Let them go past&quot;.
Other plans considered were building a stop bank on the Desert Road, or creating an early-warning system, which would be much more expensive than digging a trench. In 2001, the Eastern Ruapehu Lahar Alarm and Warning System (ERLAWS) system was installed on the mountain to detect a crater wall collapse and alert the relevant authorities. It began operating in 2002. The lake gradually filled with snowmelt and had reached the level of the hard rock rim by January 2005. The lahar finally occurred on 18 March 2007 (see below).

===2006 and 2007 activity===

Ruapehu erupted at 10:24 p.m. on 4 October 2006. The small eruption was marked by a magnitude 2.9 volcanic earthquake and sent waves 4– tall crashing into the wall of the crater. No ash was erupted into the atmosphere, and the eruption is presumed to have occurred entirely underwater.
At 11:22 a.m. 18 March 2007, the tephra dam which had been holding back Crater Lake burst, sending a lahar down the mountain. An estimated 1.9–3.8 million cubic metres of mud, rock, and water travelled down the Whangaehu river. ERLAWS activated, sending an alarm to pagers at 11:25 a.m. and automatically activating warning lights and barrier arms to close roads and stop trains. There was no serious damage and no injuries. A toilet block at the Tangiwai memorial was destroyed, but the memorial had already been closed due to the lahar threat. One family was trapped for around 24 hours after the lahar swept away the access route to their home.

At 8:16 p.m. on 25 September 2007, volcanic tremor was detected underneath Ruapehu, which was followed at 8:26 p.m. by an explosive surtseyan eruption. The explosive phase of the eruption lasted for less than a minute and blasted ash, mud, and rocks northward, reaching to about 2 km from Crater Lake. Two climbers were caught in the eruption at Dome Shelter, an alpine hut approximately 600 m from the crater, when the hut was struck by the surge. The climbers nearly drowned before the hut floor gave way and the water drained into the basement seismometer vault. One of them, a 22-year-old primary school teacher, had a leg pinned and crushed by a boulder as the water subsided. A rescue operation was mounted after his companion, who was unable to free him, went down the mountain for help.

The eruption initiated lahars down the Whangaehu valley and the Whakapapa skifield. ERLAWS detected the lahars in the Whangaehu valley. A snow groomer on the Whakapapa skifield narrowly avoided being caught in the lahar there.

===Current activity and future hazards===

Only one eruptive event has been recorded at Ruapehu since the 2007 eruption—a minor event on 13 July 2009 when a small volcanic earthquake beneath Crater Lake caused the lake water level to rise 15 cm and triggered a snow slurry lahar in the upper Whangaehu valley. Since then, Crater Lake has continued its regular cycle of heating and increased gas emissions, although with periods of sustained high temperatures that occurred in 2011, 2016 and 2019.

Eruptions at Ruapehu are expected to continue much as they have for the past 2,000 years, with frequent minor eruptions and more significant events every 20–30 years, although the possibility of larger events like the Pahoka-Mangamate event cannot be ruled out. The previous activity trend until 10,000 years ago was about erupted each 10,000 years. Minor eruptions, such as the one in 2007, especially if they are hydrothermal, can occur at any time without warning. However, in historic times, major eruptions such as the ones in 1995–96 have only occurred within periods of enhanced activity.

The main recent volcanic hazard at Ruapehu is from lahars. Two major lahar paths run through the Whakapapa skifield, and in recent times, lahars have travelled through the ski field in 1969, 1975, 1995, and 2007. An eruption warning system operates in the ski field to warn skiers in the event of another eruption. Lahars also represent a significant hazard to surrounding river valleys, particularly the Whangaehu River, which is crossed by national highways, the North Island Main Trunk railway line, and electricity transmission lines. Large, destructive lahars have been observed in the Whangaehu River in 1862, 1895, 1953, 1975, and 2007.

GNS Science continuously monitors Ruapehu using a network of seismographs, GPS stations, microphones and webcams. Chemical analysis of the water in Crater Lake is regularly undertaken along with airborne gas measurements. Live data can be viewed on the GeoNet website.

==Recreational==

The mountain, as part of Tongariro National Park is host to a wide range of recreational activities.

===Skiing===

Since the first ski field developments in 1923, Ruapehu has had three ski areas developed, Whakapapa on the north-western side, Tūroa on the south western slopes, and a club Tukino field on the east of the mountain. The commercial developments have not been a consistent success, with at least two business failures by 2023. While as of 2001, Mount Ruapehu had the largest total ski area in New Zealand, developments in the South Island may see by 2025 the establishment there of the largest single commercial ski area in New Zealand. A 60-year concession for commercial ski field operation was granted to the then operator of the Whakapapa ski field, in 2015. After the operator went into receivership in 2023 a new operator has expressed interest in taking over the Whakapapa concession. From April 2024, Tūroa operated by Pure Tūroa Limited has a limited ten year concession.

Winter access to the mountain, car parks and ski fields has restrictions.

===Climbing and walking===
There are multiple walking tracks and routes on the mountain&#x27;s slopes. Alpine huts are provided for trampers and climbers. These are mainly owned by private clubs. Blyth Hut, Lupton Hut (private), Mangaehuehu Hut, Mangaturuturu Hut, Rangipo Hut, and Whangaehu Hut on the mountain are potentially listed as available for use by the Department of Conservation. Campsites also exist on the slopes of the mountain.

====Waihohonu Hut====

Waihohonu Hut is a historic cabin located in the Tongariro National Park. The cabin was constructed in 1904 and is now the oldest extant mountain hut in New Zealand. It was registered as a category 1 historic building with Heritage New Zealand in 1993. It was used early in its history as a stop over for stage coaches.

====Glacier Hut====
Glacier Hut now serves as a skiing museum. It was built in 1923 and was New Zealand&#x27;s first purpose-built structure for the sport of skiing.

<doc id="63568" wikidata="Q3022996" url="?curid=63568" title="Dennis the Menace (U.S. comics)">
<text>Dennis the Menace is a daily syndicated newspaper comic strip originally created, written, and illustrated by Hank Ketcham. The comic strip made its debut on March 12, 1951 in 16 newspapers and was originally distributed by Post-Hall Syndicate. The full-color Sunday strip debuted in January 1952. It is now written and drawn by Ketcham&#x27;s former assistants, Marcus Hamilton (weekdays, since 1995), Ron Ferdinand (Sundays, since 1981), and son Scott Ketcham (since 2010), and distributed to at least 1,000 newspapers in 48 countries and in 19 languages by King Features Syndicate. The comic strip usually runs for a single panel on weekdays and a full strip on Sundays.

It has been adapted to other popular media, including several television shows, both live-action and animated, and several feature films, including theatrical and direct-to-video releases.

Coincidentally, a UK comic strip of the same name debuted on the same day. The two are not related and change their names subtly in each other&#x27;s respective countries of origin to avoid confusion.

==Characters and setting==
&quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; takes place in a middle-class suburban neighborhood in Wichita, Kansas. In the comics, the Mitchell family lives in a two-story house at the fictional address of 2251 Pine Street. The Wilson family lives next door at 2253 Pine Street. The television series differs, putting the Wilsons at the also-fictional 627 Elm Street.

===The Mitchell family===
* Dennis Roger Mitchell is a freckle-faced five-year-old boy with a troublesome but soft-hearted and helpful personality. His long-suffering parents, Henry and Alice Mitchell, can only shake their heads and try to explain their son&#x27;s antics to others, yet they very much love and care for him. The comic efficacy of Dennis&#x27;s personality lies within how his genuine attempts to help those in need, combined with his youthful energy and enthusiasm, frequently lead to trouble wherever he goes (usually at Mr. Wilson&#x27;s expense). He wears a black T-shirt with blue stripes, red overalls, and white sneakers. He hates carrots and baths, loves root beer (especially with cookies or brownies), ketchup, sandwiches, water pistols, playing with other boys his age, mud puddles, camping, and Westerns (especially those starring Cowboy Bob, the comic&#x27;s take on the Lone Ranger), and has occasionally been depicted wearing a cowboy costume. Dennis has a Cowboy Bob Deputy Badge, poster, and an autographed picture of Cowboy Bob, as well. Among the running gags: Dennis has a soft spot for animals such as kittens and puppies, which he is always taking home to feed; he loves loud instruments, such as horns and drums, and he ruins Christmas songs with shouts of cowboy songs or annoys adults by shouting out loud. When Dennis is in the local department store trying out toys, such as tricycles, he often ends up breaking them and making his parents buy them. In fact, Dennis nearly causes portrait photographers, hairdressers, bank presidents, grocery-store personnel, kindergarten teachers, restaurant waiters, librarians, museum security guards, police officers, bus drivers, house heating equipment repairmen, the town mayor, department-store Christmas Santa Clauses and saleswomen, drug store salesmen, hardware store salesmen, shoe salesmen, barbers, and the local post office workers to have nervous breakdowns when he comes around. A running gag is that Dennis causes chaos wherever he visits, such as the city park, a Marineland Aquarium, the US Army, and even on vacation trips to Mexico and Hollywood. Despite all this, he is a &quot;popular kid&quot; with his peers, having countless friends both at his school and around the neighborhood, who are taken with his very fun-loving demeanor. Dennis also believes in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. Another running gag is Dennis dreaming that he meets Santa Claus on Christmas Eve and causing chaos for everyone else.
* Henry Mitchell, age 32, is Dennis&#x27; father, an aeronautical engineer. Henry seems to understand Dennis more than his wife does, especially in affairs of the heart. One example was when a furious Dennis stormed in, saying, &quot;Woman can say some of the stupidest things!&quot; Henry knowingly said to Alice, &quot;Margaret.&quot; Another time, while Dennis was watching Gina, he confided to his dad, &quot;There&#x27;s somethin&#x27; about Gina that I can&#x27;t figure out.&quot; Henry wisely advised his son, &quot;Wait.&quot; Again, Henry and Alice overhear Dennis tell Gina that she &quot;smelled better than a plateful of peanut butter sandwiches.&quot; Henry remarks, &quot;The ultimate compliment.&quot; Like his creator Hank Ketcham, Henry served in the United States Navy; starting position as a quartermaster (helmsman) second class on a US Navy ship, he ended up on an aircraft carrier and rose to the rank of chief petty officer. Among his hobbies are playing card games such as poker, bird watching, and playing the ukulele and singing old songs. A running gag is that Henry often plays the straight man dupe—either resulting from Dennis&#x27;s &quot;helpfulness,&quot; or because of his foolishness; once, he tried to save money on a Christmas tree by cutting one down in the country—and ended up paying $20.00 ($10.00 for a fine and $10.00 for the owner charging him for the tree).
* Alice Mitchell, née Aberdeen is Dennis&#x27; stay-at-home mother, who is usually the reassuring figure to whom Dennis can run when things get too overwhelming, ready to greet him with a warm hug. Although she grew up among animals on a chicken ranch, a running gag is that Alice is Ophidiophobic. (She also dislikes mice and white rats, implying she is musiphobic as well.) She is the president of a local bridge club. Another running gag involves Dennis&#x27;s ever-changing parade of new babysitters; no one will take the job twice, much to Alice&#x27;s annoyance. Alice is the disciplinarian in the Mitchell household; for example, she punishes Dennis for his misbehavior by having him sit in the corner in a rocking chair for timeout. 
* Ruff Mitchell is Dennis&#x27;s pet dog (a Newfoundland mix) and best friend. He is always eagerly following him around, accompanying him while Dennis is running, or riding his bike or skateboard. Another running gag is that although Ruff chases cats, he is afraid of them.
* Hot Dog is Dennis&#x27;s rarely seen cat, which usually commiserates with him while he sits in the corner and reflects on his wrongdoings. Dennis gave the cat its name after the cat ate a package of hot dogs.
* Barney is another cat of the Mitchells.
* Grandparents Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell
* Grampa (Arnold &quot;Swede&quot; Aberdeen) is Alice&#x27;s father, who spoils Dennis often. He evokes the unintentional jealousy of Mr. Wilson, for he gets to see Dennis occasionally, but Mr. Wilson sees him all the time. Because they are so much alike, Dennis and Grampa Johnson get along well. Mr. Wilson and Grampa have different perspectives on life and how to live it. While Mr. Wilson believes in acting one&#x27;s age, Grampa encourages Dennis to enjoy life to the fullest. His wife&#x27;s status is unknown; she is never seen in the comics, although she is mentioned four times—twice when, thanks to Dennis, Alice finds out Henry destroyed his Christmas gift (a tie) from his mother-in-law; another time a furious Alice finds out that Henry had thrown his mother-in-law&#x27;s gift (a tie) into the trash. Another time, Alice wished her mother a Happy Mother&#x27;s Day by telephone. Grandpa mentions his wife to Dennis but not her status
* Uncle Fred and Aunt Mollie
* Uncle Richard and Aunt Ginny
* Uncle John lives in Florida. The Mitchells visited him once for a vacation.
* Uncle Al lives in Texas and works in the &quot;oil business.&quot; He runs a small oil and gas station.
* Uncle Charlie
* Uncle Ernie and Aunt Blanche
*Aunt Betty
* Aunt Hetty
* Aunt Sue

===The Wilsons===
* George Everett Wilson Sr. is Dennis&#x27;s cranky, cantankerous, middle-aged next-door neighbor, a retired mail carrier and (at least as far as Dennis is concerned) his best adult friend. Not much is told about his early life except he grew up on a farm, lived through The Great Depression of the 1930s, served in World War II, and is a retired postman. Dennis loves Mr. Wilson, but unintentionally annoys him, as he regularly disrupts Mr. Wilson&#x27;s attempts at a serene, quiet life; he often interrupts Mr. Wilson&#x27;s hobbies such as gardening and bird watching, at times accidentally damaging his property. As a result, he displays a less than cordial attitude towards the young boy, though Dennis continues his well-meaning intrusions unabated. As many readers suspected, he is secretly fond of Dennis and misses him when he is away, although he would never openly admit it. On one occasion when the Mitchells went to Hollywood for two weeks, Mr. Wilson kept seeing Dennis&#x27; face everywhere! Mr. Wilson is named after a teacher Hank Ketcham knew. Dennis often (especially in the television series) refers to him as &quot;Good Ol&#x27; Mr. Wilson.&quot; Although a running gag is that Dennis&#x27;s pranks drive Mr. Wilson crazy, at times Dennis tries to do nice things for Mr. Wilson, such as the time Dennis left Ruff the dog and Hot Dog the cat with Mr. Wilson so he would not be lonely on Father&#x27;s Day, while Dennis and his father went to a baseball game, or the time Dennis tries to cheer Mr. Wilson up on April Fool&#x27;s day by placing a fake &quot;Mitchell House for sale&quot; sign up.
* Martha Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s engaging wife who adores Dennis. Mrs. Wilson freely dotes on him and plies him with freshly baked cookies and milk. Martha sees Dennis as a surrogate grandson. By 1975, George and Martha had been married for 25 years.
* John Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s brother.
* Eloise Wilson is John&#x27;s wife and Mr. Wilson&#x27;s sister-in-law.
* Earl Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s estranged son.
* Elena Wilson is Earl&#x27;s wife.
* Winnie Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s granddaughter and Earl&#x27;s daughter.
* Walter &quot;Walt&quot; Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s grandson and Earl&#x27;s son.
* Keith Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s grandson and Earl&#x27;s son.
* Sammy Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s grandson and Earl&#x27;s son.
* George Wilson Jr. is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s son.
* Edna Wilson is George Jr.&#x27;s wife.
* Tammy Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s daughter.
* George Wilson III is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s grandson.
* Will Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s grandson.
* Helga Wilson is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s granddaughter.
* Uncle Ned is Mr. Wilson&#x27;s 70-year-old uncle who visited his nephew in 1964.

===Dennis&#x27; friends===
* Tommy Anderson is Dennis&#x27; best friend (after Mr. Wilson). This character eventually disappeared from the strip, although he does make appearances in the &quot;Dennis the Menace Pocket Full of Fun&quot; books.
* Joey McDonald is loyal, timid, and not too bright. He is a year younger than Dennis. He usually plays the sidekick to Dennis&#x27;s schemes and sees him as a big brother figure. Dennis often gives him naïve advice and gives him little &quot;nuggets&quot; of wisdom and insight.
* Margaret Wade is a freckled, red-haired, bespectacled know-it-all whose cloying and self-important demeanor is always getting on Dennis&#x27;s nerves. She is attracted to Dennis and is stubbornly confident in the belief that she will marry him in adulthood, but he has no interest in her. She always tries to improve Dennis and his manners but succeeds only in annoying him. She has a certain amount of dislike for Gina, whom she sees as her competition. Gina gains Dennis&#x27; respect and admiration by just being herself, and Margaret&#x27;s pretensions fail to impress him. Margaret, who is two years older than Dennis, is very ambitious: when she was five, she decided to join the Camp Fire Girls when she reaches the age of seven, and in one cartoon, she sells Girl Scout cookies to the Mitchells. She likes taking gymnastics and ballet, and singing Christmas carols. She is a devout religious believer, and has had pets of her own—four white Persian cats: one named Charlie, one named Prudence, one named Snowflake, and another named Mr. Coddles (whom she wheels around in a baby carriage). Whenever Margaret seeks to show him kindness, such as inviting him over to her house to help decorate a Christmas tree, be a guest at her birthday party, or when Dennis tries to have Margaret give him too much candy, Dennis&#x27; &quot;helpfulness&quot; results in his expulsion. Regardless of his ill-will toward Margaret, Dennis cannot resist eating at the Wades&#x27;. Margaret and Dennis are not always adversaries. Dennis once used a water pistol to spray both Margaret and Gina with his mother&#x27;s perfume, prompting both to play with him and angering his mother. Margaret is a frequent victim of Dennis&#x27;s practical jokes, such as being sprayed by a garden hose. On one Valentine&#x27;s Day, Dennis gave &quot;trick&quot; Valentine&#x27;s messages to Margaret, Gina, and Sally that had messages read &quot;I DON&#x27;T Like&quot;, which earned him punishment. In one April Fool&#x27;s Day comic, Dennis decided to trick Margaret with compliments instead of pranks; to his horror, she accepted the joke as real and dragged Dennis to hear her piano playing. Although she is fond of Dennis, she can lose her temper and &quot;bop&quot; him.
* Gina Gillotti is a fiercely independent young Italian-American girl, on whom Dennis is mostly unaware that he has a crush. Gina is tomboyish yet still feminine in appearance. She also likes Dennis in a future-sweethearts manner, but in contrast to his dislike of Margaret, Dennis enjoys Gina&#x27;s company because of her independent mind and their common interests. Gina is aware of her femininity, and woe betide anyone who thinks otherwise. Just as Margaret had &quot;flipped&quot; Dennis in karate, Gina once &quot;flipped&quot; Dennis in judo.
* Jackson is an African American character whom Ketcham decided to add to the cast in the late 1960s. A panel from May 13, 1970, depicted Jackson and Dennis playing in the backyard, with Dennis saying to his father, &quot;I&#x27;m having some race trouble with Jackson. He runs FASTER than I do!&quot; Because Jackson was illustrated as a racial caricature, the character was not received well. Protests erupted in Detroit, Little Rock, Miami, and St. Louis, and debris was thrown at the offices of the &quot;Post Dispatch&quot;. Taken aback, Ketcham issued a statement explaining that his intentions were innocent. Jackson appeared in another comic with a less exaggerated design, in which Dennis says &quot;Me &#x27;n Jackson are exactly the same age. Only he&#x27;s different. He&#x27;s &quot;left-handed&quot;.&quot; However, readers found the redesigned character &quot;scarcely less offensive&quot;. He makes no further prominent appearances in the comics. 
** On January 22nd, 2024, Dennis is illustrated speaking to a black child of indeterminate identity. This child does not resemble either of Jackson&#x27;s earlier designs, but like Jackson, he has no spoken dialogue.
* Jay Weldon is another African American friend of Dennis. He appeared in the 1986 animated series and was characterized as being fond of basketball. Jay was much more well-received than the character of Jackson because he was not designed as a caricature.
* Ben is a Jewish friend of Dennis. Although they celebrate different religious holidays, Ben and Dennis bond over a love of Halloween.
* Cowboy Bob is a film cowboy whom Dennis idolizes. He appears in a series of Westerns known as Cowboy Bob films. The boy fails to realize that Westerns are rarely made in his day and that the films he watches are reruns. In one story arc, Dennis&#x27; parents invite the retired actor to a party, and Dennis meets him and comments that he must be Cowboy Bob&#x27;s grandfather.

==History==
===Inspiration===
The inspiration for the comic strip came from Dennis Ketcham, the real-life son of Hank Ketcham, who, at four years old, refused to take a nap and made a complete mess of his room. Hank tried many possible names for the character and translated them into rough pencil sketches, but when his studio door flew open, his then-wife Alice, in utter exasperation, exclaimed, &quot;Your son is a menace!&quot;, the &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; name stuck. The character of Henry Mitchell bore a striking resemblance to Ketcham, while the Mitchell family of Dennis, Henry/Hank, and Alice were all named after the Ketchams.

===Visuals===
Ketcham&#x27;s line work has been highly praised over the years. A review on comicbookbin.com states: &quot;...a growing legion of cartoonists, scholars, aficionados, etc. have come to appreciate the artistry of Dennis&#x27;s creator, Hank Ketcham. Ketcham&#x27;s beautiful artwork defines cartooning elegance. The design, the composition, and the line: it&#x27;s all too, too beautiful.&quot; AV Club reviewer Noel Murray wrote: &quot;Ketcham also experimented with his line a little early on, tightening and thickening without losing the looseness and spontaneity that remains the strip&#x27;s best aspect even now.&quot;

In 2005, Dennis appeared as a guest for Blondie and Dagwood&#x27;s 75th anniversary party in the comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;.

===Awards===
Ketcham received the Reuben Award for the strip in 1953.
He was also made honorary mayor of Wichita. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I set the whole thing in Wichita, Kansas, and as a result I got made an honorary mayor of Wichita.&quot;

===Ketcham retires===

Hank Ketcham retired from the comic strip in 1994, turning over production of the strip to his assistants Ron Ferdinand and Marcus Hamilton. They continued their run after Ketcham&#x27;s death in 2001, alongside Scott Ketcham since 2010.

==Advertising==
Dennis the Menace appeared in A&amp;W Restaurants advertising in the 1960s, then Dairy Queen marketing from 1971 until 2001, when he was dropped because Dairy Queen felt children could no longer relate to him. Dennis also appeared in the Sears Roebuck Wish Book Christmas catalog in the 1970s.

==Comic books==
Dennis the Menace has been published in comic books and comic digests from the 1950s through the 1980s by a variety of publishers, including Standard/Pines (1953–58), Fawcett Comics (1958–80, during their only return to comics after settling the Captain Marvel lawsuit and selling much of their comics division to Charlton Comics), and Marvel Comics (1981–82). These included both newspaper strip reprints and original &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; comic book stories, produced by others besides Ketcham. Al Wiseman, one of Ketcham&#x27;s assistants in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, worked on many of them. Ron Ferdinand, Ketcham&#x27;s Sunday page artist, drew several of the Dennis stories in the Marvel books, including the cover for issue No. 11.

===Main Series===
The main comic book series (simply named &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;) was initially published by Standard Comics, running for fourteen issues from August 1953 to January 1956. After his Standard Comics imprint became defunct, publisher Ned Pines continued the series at Pines Comics for another seventeen issues (15–31) from March 1956 to November 1958, after which the series moved to Hallden-Fawcett. Fawcett had previously ceased publishing comics after settling a lawsuit (&quot;National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.&quot;) over Captain Marvel with DC Comics and selling much of their comics division to Charlton Comics. The series carried the &quot;Hallden&quot; cover imprint for issues 32–40 (January 1959–January 1960), &quot;Hallden-Fawcett&quot; for issues 41–76 (March 1960–January 1965), and simply &quot;Fawcett&quot; for issues 77–154 (March 1965–January 1978). The series was published by CBS Consumer Publishing for the final issues 155–166 (March 1978–November 1979), with the relevant indicias listing &quot;the Hallden Unit, CBS Consumer Publishing, a division of CBS, Inc.&quot; From issue 156 on, the covers featured a &quot;Dennis the Menace - Fun Fest&quot; label in the corner, which was continued onto the covers of &quot;Dennis the Menace Fun Fest&quot; #16 &amp; 17 (January &amp; March 1980).

===Giant series===
Running in tandem with the main comic book series was the &quot;Dennis the Menace Giant Series&quot;, beginning with the publication of &quot;Dennis the Menace Giant Vacation Special&quot; and &quot;Dennis the Menace Christmas Issue&quot; by Standard Comics in 1955. Those issues inaugurated the &quot;Giant&quot; series, which was published by Pines for issues 2–6, and was continued by Hallden/Fawcett for issues 6–75. The &quot;Giant&quot; series was renamed the &quot;Dennis the Menace Bonus Magazine Series&quot; beginning with issue #76 in 1970. While the indicia titled remained the same until the end of the series, under CBS Consumer Publishing, the covers began to feature &quot;Big Bonus Series&quot; in small text at the top left beginning with issue #174 (March 1978), and the cover title became &quot;Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series&quot; beginning with issue #181 (August 1978), continuing until the series ended with issue #194 (October 1979). The cover title continued in 1980 with the February and April releases of &quot;Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series&quot; #10 &amp; 11, after which the character moved to Marvel Comics.

In 1972, the &quot;Dennis the Menace Bonus Magazine Series&quot; #103 &quot;Short Stuff Special&quot; featured Dennis visiting Children&#x27;s Fairyland in Oakland, California.

===Other series===

In the Summer of 1961, Fawcett published two one-shots, first &quot;Dennis the Menace and His Dog Ruff&quot; #1 and then &quot;Dennis the Menace and His Pal Joey&quot; #1. Eight years later, &quot;Dennis the Menace and Joey&quot; #2 (July 1969) was published, followed by &quot;Dennis the Menace and Ruff&quot; #2 (September 1969), &quot;Dennis the Menace and Mr. Wilson&quot; #1 (October 1969), and &quot;Dennis the Menace and Margaret&quot; #1 (Winter 1969). These four issues continued into Dennis the Menace and His Friends Series, which began with #5 (January 1970), and which featured Margaret, Joey, Ruff, and Mr. Wilson (along with matching cover titles) in rotation four times a year until concluding with issue #46 (April 1980).

From Summer 1959 to Spring 1961, Hallden-Fawcett published five issues of The Best of Dennis the Menace, a one-hundred-page digest series collecting previously published stories from Standard, Pines, and Hallden-Fawcett. Similarly, from Spring 1969 to March 1980, fifty issues of Dennis the Menace: Pocket Full of Fun! were published by Hallden-Fawcett and (for the final three issues) CBS Consumer Publishing. It was a quarterly (January, April, July, and October) digest series collecting stories from previously published comics. Finally, just before &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; moved to Marvel, CBS Consumer Publishing released two issues of The Very Best of Dennis the Menace (July 1979–April 1980).

===Bible Kids series===
In 1977, Word Books, Inc. (now HarperCollins) commissioned Hank Ketcham Enterprises, Inc. to produce a series of 10 comic books under the title &quot;Dennis and the Bible Kids&quot;, with the usual cast of characters reading (and sometimes partly acting out) the stories of Joseph, Moses, David, Esther, Jesus, and other Biblical characters. These were sold through Christian bookstores and related outlets. Each issue contained several inspirational renderings by Hank Ketcham himself.

===Marvel series===

After the end of the Hallden and CBS comics run in 1980, Ketcham had half of the comic book rights purchased by Stan Lee and Marvel Comics, so they were able to produce a new series of &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; comic books. The new Marvel series ran for thirteen issues from December 1981 to November 1982. The smaller one-hundred-page &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; comic digests published by Hallden-Fawcett were briefly resurrected in by Marvel in 1982 for a run of three issues titled The Very Best of Dennis the Menace, as well as a run of three issues simply titled Dennis the Menace Comics Digest.

==Worldwide success==
===Film and television===
&quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; has been the subject of a number of adaptations.

The first one produced is a CBS sitcom that aired from 1959 to 1963 starring Jay North as Dennis, Herbert Anderson as Henry Mitchell; Joseph Kearns as George Wilson, and subsequently Gale Gordon as his brother, John Wilson. North also appeared as Dennis on an episode of &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; and in the theatrical film &quot;Pepe&quot; (both 1960). In the United Kingdom, the series was titled simply &quot;Just Dennis&quot;, so as not to conflict with the &quot;Beano&quot; character of the same name.

On September 11, 1987, a &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; live-action television film was broadcast; it was later released on video under the title &quot;Dennis the Menace: Dinosaur Hunter&quot;.

Another live-action &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; film, starring Walter Matthau as Mr. Wilson and Mason Gamble as Dennis, was released to theaters in 1993. It was originally titled &quot;The Real Dennis the Menace&quot; before the final name was approved. This was followed with the direct-to-video &quot;Dennis the Menace Strikes Again&quot; in 1998, starring Don Rickles as Mr. Wilson. The most recent film adaptation, &quot;A Dennis the Menace Christmas&quot; was released to DVD on November 6, 2007. The Warner Bros. production starred Robert Wagner as Mr. Wilson, Louise Fletcher as Mrs. Wilson, and Maxwell Perry Cotton, then a six-year-old actor, as Dennis.

===Animation===
&quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; was adapted into an animated special, &quot;Dennis the Menace in Mayday for Mother&quot; which aired in 1981 and was produced by DePatie–Freeling Enterprises and Mirisch Films.

A daily animated syndicated series was produced by DIC Entertainment in 1986, featuring Brennan Thicke as the voice of Dennis, and Phil Hartman as George Wilson and Henry Mitchell. Both roles were recast to Maurice LaMarche in the second season.

DIC also produced &quot;The All-New Dennis the Menace&quot; for CBS Saturday Mornings in 1993 with Adam Wylie voicing Dennis, Greg Burson voicing George Wilson, and June Foray voicing Martha Wilson.

An animated film, &quot;Dennis the Menace in Cruise Control&quot;, premiered as part of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Movie Toons&quot; block in 2002 and later released to DVD.

===Playgrounds===
====Monterey, California====
In 1952, Hank Ketcham spearheaded the construction of the Dennis the Menace Playground, designed by Arch Garner. It opened in Monterey, California on November 17, 1956. The playground featured a bronze statue of Dennis sculpted by Wah Chang. On the night of October 25, 2006, the 125 lb statue, which was estimated to be worth $30,000, was stolen from the playground. In April 2007, it was replaced by a reproduction of another Dennis statue Chang made for the Ketchams. It was donated by Willis W. and Ethel M. Clark Foundation. In 2015 the missing statue was found in a scrap yard in Florida, returned to Monterey, and installed in front of the city recreation office.

====Midland, Texas====
On July 11, 1959, another Dennis the Menace Park opened in Midland, Texas. It was an adventure playground modeled after the park in Monterey. The park was funded by an anonymous donor with the stipulation there would be no charge for admission. The city of Midland updated the park in 1993 and again in 2019 to include new and inclusive play equipment and a splash pad.

===Video games===
* &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (known as Dennis in Europe), a video game tie-in to the 1993 feature film, was released that same year by Ocean Software for the Super NES, Amiga and Game Boy.

===&quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; in other languages===
The comic strip has been translated into many foreign languages, which has helped make the strip&#x27;s characters famous worldwide.

<text>Microsoft QuickBASIC (also QB) is an Integrated Development Environment (or IDE) and compiler for the BASIC programming language that was developed by Microsoft. QuickBASIC runs mainly on DOS, though there was also a short-lived version for the classic Mac OS. It is loosely based on GW-BASIC but adds user-defined types, improved programming structures, better graphics and disk support and a compiler in addition to the interpreter. 
Microsoft marketed QuickBASIC as the introductory level for their BASIC Professional Development System. Microsoft marketed two other similar IDEs for C and Pascal, viz QuickC and QuickPascal.

==History==
Microsoft released the first version of QuickBASIC on August 18, 1985 on a single 5.25-inch 360 KB floppy disk. QuickBASIC version 2.0 and later contained an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), allowing users to edit directly in its on-screen text editor.

Although still supported in QuickBASIC, line numbers became optional. Program jumps also worked with named labels. Later versions also added control structures, such as multiline conditional statements and loop blocks.

Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;PC BASIC Compiler&quot; was included for compiling programs into DOS executables. Beginning with version 4.0, the editor included an interpreter that allowed the programmer to run the program without leaving the editor. The interpreter was used to debug a program before creating an executable file. Unfortunately, there were some subtle differences between the interpreter and the compiler, which meant that large programs that ran correctly in the interpreter might fail after compilation, or not compile at all because of differences in the memory management routines.

The last version of QuickBASIC was version 4.5 (1988), although development of the Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) continued until its last release of version 7.1 in October 1990. At the same time, the QuickBASIC packaging was silently changed so that the disks used the same compression used for BASIC PDS 7.1. The Basic PDS 7.x version of the IDE was called QuickBASIC Extended (QBX), and it only ran on DOS, unlike the rest of Basic PDS 7.x, which also ran on OS/2.

QuickBASIC 4.5 was the subject of numerous books, articles, and programming tutorials, and arrived near the high-point of BASIC saturation in the PC marketplace. In 1989, Microsoft Press bundled the QuickBASIC Interpreter into a book-and-software learning system called &quot;Learn BASIC Now&quot;. The product was priced at $39.95 and included a Foreword written by Bill Gates, who reported that BASIC was in active use by over four million PC users.

The successor to QuickBASIC and Basic PDS was Visual Basic version 1.0 for MS-DOS, shipped in Standard and Professional versions. Later versions of Visual Basic did not include DOS versions, as Microsoft concentrated on Windows applications.

A subset of QuickBASIC 4.5, named QBasic, was included with MS-DOS 5 and later versions, replacing the GW-BASIC included with previous versions of MS-DOS. Compared to QuickBASIC, QBasic is limited to an interpreter only, lacks a few functions, can only handle programs of a limited size, and lacks support for separate program modules. Since it lacks a compiler, it cannot be used to produce executable files, although its program source code can still be compiled by a QuickBASIC 4.5, PDS 7.x or VBDOS 1.0 compiler, if available.

QuickBASIC 1.00 for the Apple Macintosh operating system was launched in 1988. It was officially supported on machines running System 6 with at least 1 MB of RAM. QuickBASIC could also be run on System 7, as long as 32-bit addressing was disabled. QuickBASIC programming was significantly different on the Macintosh, because the system offered a graphical user interface and an event-driven programming model.

==Syntax example==
Hello, World, shortest version:

?&quot;Hello, World&quot;
Hello, World, extended version:

CLS
PRINT &quot;Hello, World&quot;
END
99 Bottles of Beer:

LET BOTTLES = 99: LET BOTTLES$ = &quot;99&quot;: LET BOTTLE$ = &quot; bottles&quot;
FOR A = 1 TO 99
PRINT BOTTLES$; BOTTLE$; &quot; of beer on the wall, &quot;; BOTTLES$; BOTTLE$; &quot; of beer.&quot;
LET BOTTLES = BOTTLES - 1
IF BOTTLES &gt; 0 THEN LET BOTTLES$ = LTRIM$(STR$(BOTTLES)): LET PRONOUN$ = &quot;one&quot;
IF BOTTLES = 0 THEN LET BOTTLES$ = &quot;no more&quot;: LET PRONOUN$ = &quot;it&quot;
IF BOTTLES &lt;&gt; 1 THEN LET BOTTLE$ = &quot; bottles&quot;
IF BOTTLES = 1 THEN LET BOTTLE$ = &quot; bottle&quot;
PRINT &quot;Take &quot;; PRONOUN$; &quot; down and pass it around, &quot;; BOTTLES$; BOTTLE$; &quot; of beer on the wall.&quot;
PRINT: NEXT A
PRINT &quot;No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.&quot;
PRINT &quot;Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.&quot;

==Current uses==
QuickBASIC has a community of hobby programmers who use the compiler to write video games, GUIs and utilities. The community has several Web sites, message boards and online magazines.

Today, programmers sometimes use DOS emulators, such as DOSBox, to run QuickBASIC on Linux and on modern personal computers that no longer support the compiler. Alternatives to this include FreeBASIC and QB64, but they cannot yet run &quot;all&quot; QBasic/QuickBASIC programs.

Since 2008, a set of TCP/IP routines for QuickBASIC 4.x and 7.1 has revitalized some interest in the software. In particular, the vintage computer hobbyist community has been able to write software for old computers that run DOS, allowing these machines to access other computers through a LAN or the internet. This has allowed systems even as old as an 8088 to serve new functions, such as acting as a Web server or using IRC.

==Successors==
Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Basic was the successor of QuickBASIC. Other compilers, like PowerBASIC and FreeBASIC, have varying degrees of compatibility. QB64, a multiplatform QuickBASIC to C++ translator, retains close to 100% compatibility and compiles natively for Windows, Linux and macOS.

<doc id="63570" wikidata="Q201240" url="?curid=63570" title="Grouse">
<text>Grouse are a group of birds from the order Galliformes, in the family Phasianidae. Grouse are presently assigned to the tribe Tetraonini (formerly the subfamily Tetraoninae and the family Tetraonidae), a classification supported by mitochondrial DNA sequence studies, and applied by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, ITIS, International Ornithological Congress, and others. 

Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, from pine forests to moorland and mountainside, from 83°N (rock ptarmigan in northern Greenland) to 28°N (Attwater&#x27;s prairie chicken in Texas). 

The turkeys are closely allied with grouse, but they have traditionally been excluded from Tetraonini, often placed in their own tribe, subfamily, or family; certain more modern treatments also exclude them. Later phylogenomic analyses demonstrated conclusively that they are sister to the traditionally-defined grouse, and they, along with the somewhat earlier-diverging koklass pheasant, may be treated as grouse (i.e., as basal members of the Tetraonini). This is reflected in some more recent circumscriptions.

==Description==
Like many other galliforms, grouse are generally heavily-built birds. The traditional grouse (excluding turkeys) range in length from , and in weight from . If they are included, wild turkey toms are the largest grouse species, attaining lengths of 130 cm (50 in) and weighing up to 10 kg (22 lb). Male grouse are larger than females, and can be twice as heavy in the western capercaillie (the largest of the traditional grouse). Like many other galliforms, males often sport incredibly elaborate ornamentation, such as crests, fan-tails, and inflatable, brightly colored patches of bare skin. Many grouse have feathered nostrils, and some species, such as the ptarmigans, have legs which are entirely covered in feathers; in winter the toes, too, have feathers or small scales on the sides, an adaptation for walking on snow and burrowing into it for shelter. Unlike many other galliforms, they typically have no spurs, although turkeys do possess very prominent spurs.

==Feeding and habits==
Grouse feed mainly on vegetation—buds, catkins, leaves, and twigs—which typically accounts for over 95% of adults&#x27; food by weight. Thus, their diets vary greatly with the seasons. Hatchlings eat mostly insects and other invertebrates, gradually reducing their proportion of animal food to adult levels. Several of the forest-living species are notable for eating large quantities of conifer needles, which most other vertebrates refuse. To digest vegetable food, grouse have big crops and gizzards, eat grit to break up food, and have long intestines with well-developed caeca in which symbiotic bacteria digest cellulose.

Forest species flock only in autumn and winter, though individuals tolerate each other when they meet. Prairie species are more social, and tundra species (ptarmigans, &quot;Lagopus&quot;) are the most social, forming flocks of up to 100 in winter. All grouse spend most of their time on the ground, though when alarmed, they may take off in a flurry and go into a long glide.

Most species stay within their breeding range all year, but make short seasonal movements; many individuals of the ptarmigan (called rock ptarmigan in the US) and willow grouse (called willow ptarmigan in the US) migrate hundreds of kilometers.

==Reproduction==
In all but one species (the willow ptarmigan), males are polygamous. Many species have elaborate courtship displays on the ground at dawn and dusk, which in some are given in leks. The displays feature males&#x27; brightly colored combs and in some species, brightly colored inflatable sacs on the sides of their necks. The males display their plumage, give vocalizations that vary widely between species, and may engage in other activities, such as drumming or fluttering their wings, rattling their tails, and making display flights. Occasionally, males fight.

The nest is a shallow depression or scrape on the ground—often in cover—with a scanty lining of plant material. The female lays one clutch, but may replace it if the eggs are lost. She begins to lay about a week after mating and lays one egg every day or two; the clutch comprises five to 12 eggs. The eggs have the shape of hen&#x27;s eggs and are pale yellow, sparsely spotted with brown. On laying the second-last or last egg, the female starts 21 to 28 days of incubation. Chicks hatch in dense, yellow-brown down and leave the nest immediately. They soon develop feathers and can fly shortly before they are two weeks old. The female (and the male in the willow grouse) stays with them and protects them until their first autumn, when they reach their mature weights (except in the male capercaillies). They are sexually mature the following spring, but often do not mate until later years.

==Populations==
Grouse make up a considerable part of the vertebrate biomass in the Arctic and Subarctic. Their numbers may fall sharply in years of bad weather or high predator populations—significant grouse populations are a major food source for lynx, foxes, martens, and birds of prey.

The three tundra species have maintained their former numbers. The prairie and forest species have declined greatly because of habitat loss, though popular game birds such as the red grouse and the ruffed grouse have benefited from habitat management. Most grouse species are listed by the IUCN as &quot;least concern&quot; or &quot;near threatened&quot;, but the greater and lesser prairie chicken are listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; and the Gunnison grouse is listed as &quot;endangered&quot;. Some subspecies, such as Attwater&#x27;s prairie chicken and the Cantabrian capercaillie, and some national and regional populations are also in danger. The wild turkey precipitously declined before returning to abundance, even in developed areas.

==Sexual size dimorphism==
=== Male size selection ===
The phenotypic difference between males and females is called sexual dimorphism. Male grouse tend to be larger than female grouse, which seems to hold true across all the species of grouse, with some difference within each species in terms of how drastic the size difference is. The hypothesis with the most supporting evidence for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in grouse is sexual selection. Sexual selection favors large males; stronger selection for larger size in males leads to greater size dimorphism. Female size will increase correspondingly as male size increases, and this is due to heredity (but not to the extent of the male size). This is because females that are smaller will still be able to reproduce without a substantial disadvantage, but this is not the case with males. The largest among the male grouse (commonly dubbed &#x27;Biggrouse&#x27;) attract the greatest numbers of females during their mating seasons.

=== Mating behavior selection ===
Male grouse display lekking behavior, which is when many males come together in one area and put on displays to attract females. Females selectively choose among the males present for traits they find more appealing. Male grouse exhibit two types: typical lekking and exploded lekking. In typical lekking, males display in small areas defending a limited territory, and in exploded lekking, displaying males are covered over an expansive land area and share larger territories. Male grouse can also compete with one another for access to female grouse through territoriality, in which a male defends a territory which has resources that females need, like food and nest sites. These differences in male behavior in mating systems account for the evolution of body size in grouse. Males of territorial species were smaller than those of exploded lekking species, and males of typical lekking species were the largest overall. The male birds that exhibit lekking behavior, and have to compete with other males for females to choose them, have greater sexual dimorphism in size. This suggests the hypothesis of sexual selection affecting male body size and also gives an explanation for why some species of grouse have a more drastic difference between male and female body size than others.

=== Contrast with other bird species ===
Sexual size dimorphism can manifest itself differently between grouse and other birds. In some cases, the female is dominant over the male in breeding behavior, which can result in females that are larger than the males.

==In culture==

Grouse are game, and hunters kill millions each year for food, sport, and other uses. In the United Kingdom, this takes the form of driven grouse shooting. The male black grouse&#x27;s tail feathers are a traditional ornament for hats in areas such as Scotland and the Alps. Folk dances from the Alps to the North American prairies imitate the displays of lekking males.

<doc id="63572" wikidata="Q28922" url="?curid=63572" title="Old World sparrow">
<text>Old World sparrows are a group of small passerine birds forming the family Passeridae. They are also known as true sparrows, a name also used for a particular genus of the family, &quot;Passer&quot;. They are distinct from both the New World sparrows, in the family Passerellidae, and from a few other birds sharing their name, such as the Java sparrow of the family Estrildidae. Many species nest on buildings and the house and Eurasian tree sparrows, in particular, inhabit cities in large numbers. They are primarily seed-eaters, though they also consume small insects. Some species scavenge for food around cities and, like pigeons or gulls, will eat small quantities of a diversity of items.

==Description==

Generally, Old World sparrows are small, plump, brown and grey birds with short tails and stubby, powerful beaks. The differences between sparrow species can be subtle. Members of this family range in size from the chestnut sparrow (&quot;Passer eminibey&quot;), at and , to the parrot-billed sparrow (&quot;Passer gongonensis&quot;), at and . Sparrows are physically similar to other seed-eating birds, such as finches, but have a vestigial dorsal outer primary wing feather and an extra bone in the tongue. This bone, the preglossale, helps stiffen the tongue when holding seeds. Other adaptations for eating seeds are specialised bills and elongated and specialised alimentary canals.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The family Passeridae was introduced (as Passernia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. Under the classification used in the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; (&quot;HBW&quot;) main groupings of the sparrows are the true sparrows (genus &quot;Passer&quot;), the snowfinches (typically one genus, &quot;Montifringilla&quot;), and the rock sparrows (&quot;Petronia&quot; and the pale rockfinch). These groups are similar to each other, and are each fairly homogeneous, especially &quot;Passer&quot;. Some classifications also include the sparrow-weavers (&quot;Plocepasser&quot;) and several other African genera (otherwise classified among the weavers, Ploceidae) which are morphologically similar to &quot;Passer&quot;. According to a study of molecular and skeletal evidence by Jon Fjeldså and colleagues, the cinnamon ibon of the Philippines, previously considered to be a white-eye, is a sister taxon to the sparrows as defined by the &quot;HBW&quot;. They therefore classify it as its own subfamily within Passeridae.

Many early classifications of the Old World sparrows placed them as close relatives of the weavers among the various families of small seed-eating birds, based on the similarity of their breeding behaviour, bill structure, and moult, among other characters. Some, starting with P. P. Suskin in the 1920s, placed the sparrows in the weaver family as the subfamily Passerinae, and tied them to &quot;Plocepasser&quot;. Another family sparrows were classed with was the finches (Fringillidae).

Some authorities previously classified the related estrildid finches of the Old World tropics and Australasia as members of the Passeridae. Like sparrows, the estrildid finches are small, gregarious and often colonial seed-eaters with short, thick, but pointed bills. They are broadly similar in structure and habits, but tend to be very colourful and vary greatly in their plumage. The 2008 Christidis and Boles taxonomic scheme lists the estrildid finches as the separate family Estrildidae, leaving just the true sparrows in Passeridae.

Despite some resemblance such as the seed-eater&#x27;s bill and frequently well-marked heads, New World sparrows are members of a different family, Passerellidae, with 29 genera recognised. Several species in this family are notable singers. New World sparrows are related to Old World buntings, and until 2017, were included in the Old World bunting family Emberizidae.
 The hedge sparrow or dunnock (&quot;Prunella modularis&quot;) is similarly unrelated. It is a sparrow in name only, a relict of the old practice of calling more types of small birds &quot;sparrows&quot;. A few further bird species are also called sparrows, such as the Java sparrow, an estrildid finch.

=== Species ===
The family contains 43 species divided into eight genera:

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Old World sparrows are indigenous to Europe, Africa and Asia. In the Americas, Australia, and other parts of the world, settlers imported some species which quickly naturalised, particularly in urban and degraded areas. House sparrows, for example, are now found throughout North America, Australia (every state except Western Australia), parts of southern and eastern Africa, and over much of the heavily populated parts of South America.

The Old World sparrows are generally birds of open habitats, including grasslands, deserts, and scrubland. The snowfinches and ground-sparrows are all species of high latitudes. A few species, like the Eurasian tree sparrow, inhabit open woodland. The aberrant cinnamon ibon has the most unusual habitat of the family, inhabiting the canopy of cloud forest in the Philippines.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Old World sparrows are generally social birds, with many species breeding in loose colonies and most species occurring in flocks during the non-breeding season. The great sparrow is an exception, breeding in solitary pairs and remaining only in small family groups in the non-breeding season. They form large roosting aggregations in the non-breeding seasons that contain only a single species (in contrast to multi-species flocks that might gather for foraging). Sites are chosen for cover and include trees, thick bushes and reed beds. The assemblages can be quite large with up to 10,000 house sparrows counted in one roost in Egypt.

The Old World sparrows are some of the few passerine birds that engage in dust bathing. They will first scratch a hole in the ground with their feet, then lie in it and fling dirt or sand over their bodies with flicks of their wings. They will also bathe in water, or in dry or melting snow. Water bathing is similar to dust bathing, with the sparrow standing in shallow water and flicking water over its back with its wings, also ducking its head under the water. Both activities are social, with up to a hundred birds participating at once, and is followed by preening and sometimes group singing.

=== Eggs ===
The house sparrow typically lays 3-6 eggs, but has been known to lay as few as 1 and as many as 8 greenish-white eggs. The incubation period is typically 10–14 days.

== Relationships with humans ==
Old World sparrows may be the most familiar of all wild birds worldwide. Many species commonly live in agricultural areas, and for several, human settlements are a primary habitat. The Eurasian tree and house sparrows are particularly specialised in living around humans and inhabit cities in large numbers. 17 of the 26 species recognised by the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; are known to nest on and feed around buildings.

Grain-eating species, in particular the house and Sudan golden sparrows, can be significant agricultural pests. They can be beneficial to humans as well, especially by eating insect pests. Attempts at large-scale control have failed to affect populations significantly, or have been accompanied by major increases in insect attacks probably resulting from a reduction of numbers, as in the Great Sparrow Campaign in 1950s China.

Because of their familiarity, the house sparrow and other species of the family are frequently used to represent the common and vulgar, or the lewd. Birds usually described later as Old World sparrows are referred to in many works of ancient literature and religious texts in Europe and western Asia. These references may not always refer specifically to Old World sparrows, or even to small, seed-eating birds, but later writers who were inspired by these texts often had the house sparrow and other members of the family in mind. In particular, Old World sparrows were associated by the ancient Greeks with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, due to their perceived lustfulness, an association echoed by later writers such as Chaucer and Shakespeare.

Jesus&#x27;s use of &quot;sparrows&quot; as an example of divine providence in the Gospel of Matthew also inspired later references, such as that in the final scene of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and the Gospel hymn &quot;His Eye Is on the Sparrow&quot;.

Sparrows are represented in ancient Egyptian art very rarely, but an Egyptian hieroglyph G37 is based on the house sparrow. The symbol had no phonetic value and was used as a determinative in words to indicate &quot;small&quot;, &quot;narrow&quot;, or &quot;bad&quot;.

Old World sparrows have been kept as pets at many times in history, even though most are not particularly colourful and their songs are unremarkable. They are also difficult to keep, as pet sparrows must be raised by hand and a considerable amount of insects are required to feed them. Nevertheless, many people succeed at hand-raising orphaned or abandoned baby sparrows.

The earliest mentions of pet sparrows are from the Romans. Not all the &quot;passeri&quot; mentioned, often as pets, in Roman literature were necessarily sparrows, but some accounts of them clearly describe their appearance and habits. The pet &quot;passer&quot; of Lesbia in Catullus&#x27;s poems may not have been a sparrow, but a thrush or European goldfinch. John Skelton&#x27;s &quot;The Boke of Phyllyp Sparowe&quot; is a lament for a pet house sparrow belonging to a Jane Scrope, narrated by Scrope.

<text>Defenestration (from Neo-Latin ) is the act of throwing someone or something out of a window.
The term was coined around the time of an incident in Prague Castle in the year 1618 which became the spark that started the Thirty Years&#x27; War. This was done in &quot;good Bohemian style&quot;, referring to the defenestration which had occurred in Prague&#x27;s New Town Hall almost 200 years earlier (July 1419), and on that occasion led to the Hussite war. The word comes from the Neo-Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;down from&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (window or opening).

By extension, the term is also used to describe the forcible or removal of an adversary.

== Origin ==
The term originates from two incidents in history, both occurring in Prague. In 1419, seven town officials were thrown from the New Town Hall, precipitating the Hussite War. In 1618, two Imperial governors and their secretary were tossed from the Prague Castle, sparking the Thirty Years&#x27; War. These incidents, particularly that in 1618, were referred to as the Defenestrations of Prague and gave rise to the term and the concept.

The word itself is derived from Neo-Latin &quot;defenestratio&quot;; with &quot;dē&quot; meaning &quot;out&quot; + &quot;fenestra&quot; meaning &quot;window&quot; + &quot;-atio&quot; as a suffix indicating an action or process.

== Notable cases ==

* Around the 9th century BC, Queen Jezebel was defenestrated by her own eunuch servants, at the urging of Jehu, according to the Hebrew Bible. ()
* It has been suggested by several chronicles (notably the Annals of Westhide Abbey) that King John killed his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, by defenestration from the castle at Rouen, France, in 1203.
* In 1378, the crafts and their leader Wouter van der Leyen occupied the Leuven city hall and seized the Leuven government. Most of the patricians left the city and fled to Aarschot. After negotiations between the parties, they agreed to share the government. The patricians did not accept this easily, as it caused them to lose their absolute power. In an attempt to regain absolute control, they had Wouter Van der Leyen assassinated in Brussels. Seeking revenge, the crafts handed over the patricians to a furious crowd. The crowd stormed the city hall and defenestrated the patricians. At least 15 patricians were killed.

* In 1383, to celebrate the acclamation of King John I of Portugal, it was ordered for all churches of the realm to ring their bells. However, upon the lack of any ringing coming from the capital&#x27;s cathedral the populace of Lisbon revolted and rammed their way inside the building. Bishop Dom Martinho of Zamora was accused of treason by the populace for being Castilian and supporting Antipope Clement VII and was, therefore, defenestrated from one of the bell towers. His corpse was assaulted and dragged to Rossio Square, where it was left to rot and be eaten by dogs, until the populace had enough of its smell and buried it in the square.
* In 1419, In the First Defenestration of Prague, a judge, the burgomaster, and some thirteen members of the town council of the New Town of Prague were defenestrated by a Hussite mob.
* In 1452, King James II of Scotland murdered William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas, with his own hands and defenestrated him at Stirling Castle.
* On April 26, 1478, after the failure of the Pazzi conspiracy to murder the ruler of Florence, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Jacopo de&#x27; Pazzi was defenestrated.
* In 1483, Prague&#x27;s Old-Town portreeve and the bodies of seven murdered New-Town aldermen were defenestrated.
*On May 16, 1562, Adham Khan, Akbar&#x27;s general and foster brother, was defenestrated twice for murdering a rival general, Ataga Khan, who had been recently promoted by Akbar. Akbar was woken up in the tumult after the murder. He struck Adham Khan down personally with his fist and immediately ordered his defenestration by royal order. The first time, his legs were broken as a result of the fall from the ramparts of Agra Fort but he remained alive. Akbar, in a rare act of cruelty probably exacerbated by his anger at the loss of his favorite general, ordered his defenestration a second time, killing him. Adham Khan had wrongly counted on the influence of his mother and Akbar&#x27;s wet nurse, Maham Anga, to save him as she was almost an unofficial regent in the days of Akbar&#x27;s youth. Akbar personally informed Maham Anga of her son&#x27;s death, to which she famously commented, &quot;You have done well.&quot; She died 40 days later of acute depression.
* In 1572, French King Charles IX&#x27;s friend, the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, was killed in accordance with the wishes of Charles&#x27; mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici. Charles allegedly said &quot;then kill them all that no man be left to reproach me&quot;. Thousands of Huguenots were killed in the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre after soldiers attacked Coligny in his house, stabbed him, and defenestrated him.
* In 1618, rebel Protestant leaders in Prague defenestrate two Catholic Royal regents and their secretary, who survived the fall out of the windows of Prague Castle.
* On December 1, 1640, during the Portuguese Restoration War, in Lisbon, a group of conspirators, who supported the rise of nobleman John, 8th Duke of Braganza to the Portuguese throne invaded Ribeira Palace and found Miguel de Vasconcelos, the hated Portuguese Secretary of state of the Habsburg Philip III, hidden in a closet, shot him and defenestrated him.
* On June 27, 1844, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, died after being shot and pushed out a window of the Carthage Jail in Carthage, Illinois while attempting to escape a mob.
* On June 11, 1903, a group of Serbian army officers murdered and defenestrated King Alexander and Queen Draga.
* In 1922, Italian politician and writer Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio was temporarily crippled after falling from a window, possibly pushed by a follower of Benito Mussolini.
* In March to April 1932, Ivanovo region of Soviet Union, due to ration cuts and labor intensification measures, strikes and spontaneous assemblies broke out. Ten thousand demonstrators ransacked the party and police buildings with slogans like &quot;Toss the Communists . . . out the window.&quot; 
* On March 10, 1948, the Czechoslovakian minister of foreign affairs Jan Masaryk was found dead, in his pyjamas, in the courtyard of the Foreign Ministry below his bathroom window. The initial investigation stated that he committed suicide by jumping out of the window, although some believe that he was murdered by the ascendant Communists. A 2004 police investigation into his death concluded that, contrary to the initial ruling, he did not commit suicide, but was defenestrated, most likely by Czechoslovak Communists and their Soviet NKVD advisers for his opposition to the February 1948 Communist putsch.
* On November 28, 1953, the U.S. biological warfare specialist Frank Olson died after a fall from a hotel window that has been suggested to have been an assassination by the CIA.

Some witnesses suggest he was beaten unconscious by a small group of young military officers and subsequently defenestrated.
* In 1962, Communist Party of Spain member Julián Grimau was seemingly tortured and then defenestrated from the premises of the Dirección General de Seguridad in Madrid suffering fractures to the wrists and serious skull injuries, prior to his execution in 1963.
* On April 15, 1966, two suspects in the so-called Bathroom Coup in Sri Lanka, Corporal Tilekawardene and L. V. Podiappuhamy (otherwise known as Dodampe Mudalali), were said by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to have jumped to their deaths from the fourth floor of the CID building in the Fort. At the inquest, following receipt of new evidence, the magistrate altered the verdict of suicide to one of culpable homicide. The remainder of the suspects were acquitted.
* In 1968, the son of China&#x27;s future paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, Deng Pufang, was thrown from a window by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.

The injuries sustained from the fall led Ransome-Kuti to lapse into a coma; she would remain in a coma for more than a year, and eventually succumb to her injuries on 13 April 1978. Ransome-Kuti&#x27;s death would be commemorated in her son&#x27;s protest song &quot;Coffin for Head of State&quot;.

* In October 2024, Mikhail Rogachev, a Russian businessman and former vice president of Yukos, was found dead after falling out of the window of his apartment building.

=== Notable autodefenestrations ===
&quot;Autodefenestration&quot; (or &quot;self-defenestration&quot;) is the term used for the act of jumping, propelling oneself, or causing oneself to fall, out of a window. 
* In the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament, the accidental autodefenestration of a young man of Troas named Eutychus is recorded. The Apostle Paul was travelling to Jerusalem and had stopped for seven days in Troas. While Paul was preaching in a third-story room late on a Sunday night to the local assembly of Christian believers, Eutychus drifted off to sleep and fell out of the window in which he was sitting. The text indicates that Eutychus did not survive but was brought back to life after Paul embraced him. ()
*In December 1840, Abraham Lincoln and four other Illinois legislators jumped out of a window in a political maneuver designed to prevent a quorum on a vote that would have eliminated the Illinois State Bank.
*During the Revolutions of 1848, an agitated crowd forced their way into the town hall in Cologne and two city councilors panicked and jumped out of the window; one of them broke both his legs. The event went down in the city&#x27;s history as the &quot;Cologne Defenestration&quot;.
*In 1961, while being arrested by communist secret service Polish activist Henryk Holland jumped out of window, which led to his death. This event was then widely discussed by dissidents and theories of a possible murder were popular.
* In 1991, British informer Martin McGartland was abducted by members of the Provisional IRA. As he waited to be interrogated, McGartland escaped the IRA by jumping from a third floor window in a Twinbrook flat where he was taken for interrogation following his abduction, and survived the fall.
* On July 9, 1993, the prominent Toronto attorney Garry Hoy fell from a 24th story window in an attempt to demonstrate to a group of new legal interns that the windows of the city&#x27;s Toronto-Dominion Centre were unbreakable. He performed the same stunt on several previous occasions – dramatically slamming his body against the window – but this time it popped out of its frame and he fell to his death. The accident was commemorated by a 1996 Darwin Award and has been re-enacted in several films and television shows.
*In 1995, the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze jumped from his Paris apartment to his death.
*In 1999, popular German Schlager singer Rex Gildo committed suicide by jumping out of the window of his apartment building.
*In 2001, at least 104 people jumped out of the Twin Towers on 9/11.

== In popular culture ==
* In his poem &quot;Defenestration&quot;, R. P. Lister wrote with amusement about the creation of so exalted a word for so basic a concept. The poem narrates the thoughts of a philosopher undergoing defenestration. As he falls, the philosopher considers why there should be a particular word for the experience, when many equally simple concepts do not have specific names. In an evidently ironic commentary on the word, Lister has the philosopher summarize his thoughts with, &quot;I concluded that the incidence of logodaedaly was purely .&quot;
* There is a range of hacker witticisms referring to &quot;defenestration&quot;. For example, the term is sometimes used humorously among Linux users to describe the act of removing Microsoft Windows from a computer.
* The indie video game developer Suspicious Developments has released three games (&quot;Gunpoint&quot;, &quot;Heat Signature&quot;, and &quot;Tactical Breach Wizards&quot;) with a focus on throwing enemies out of windows. After releasing Tactical Breach Wizards in 2024, the developers have started referring to these three games as their &quot;Defenestration Trilogy&quot;.

<doc id="63574" wikidata="Q158653" url="?curid=63574" title="-logy">
<text>-logy is a suffix in the English language, used with words originally adapted from Ancient Greek ending in (&quot;&quot;). The earliest English examples were anglicizations of the French &quot;&quot;, which was in turn inherited from the Latin &quot;&quot;.
The suffix became productive in English from the 18th century, allowing the formation of new terms with no Latin or Greek precedent.

The English suffix has two separate main senses, reflecting two sources of the suffix in Greek:
*a combining form used in the names of school or bodies of knowledge, e.g., &quot;theology&quot; (loaned from Latin in the 14th century) or &quot;sociology&quot;. In words of the type &quot;theology&quot;, the suffix is derived originally from (&quot;-log-&quot;) (a variant of , &quot;-leg-&quot;), from the Greek verb (&quot;legein&quot;, &#x27;to speak&#x27;). The suffix has the sense of &quot;the character or deportment of one who speaks or treats of [a certain subject]&quot;, or more succinctly, &quot;the study of [a certain subject]&quot;. (The Ancient Greek noun &quot;&quot; mentioned below can also be translated, among other things, as &quot;subject matter&quot;.)
*the root word nouns that refer to kinds of speech, writing or collections of writing, e.g., &quot;eulogy&quot; or &quot;trilogy&quot;. In words of this type, the &quot;-logy&quot; element is derived from the Greek noun (&quot;logos&quot;, &#x27;speech&#x27;, &#x27;account&#x27;, &#x27;story&#x27;). The suffix has the sense of &quot;[a certain kind of] speaking or writing&quot;.
Philology is an exception: while its meaning is closer to the first sense, the etymology of the word is similar to the second sense.

==-logy versus -ology==
In English names for fields of study, the suffix &quot;-logy&quot; is most frequently found preceded by the euphonic connective vowel &quot;o&quot; so that the word ends in &quot;-ology&quot;. In these Greek words, the root is always a noun and &quot;-o-&quot; is the combining vowel for all declensions of Greek nouns. However, when new names for fields of study are coined in modern English, the formations ending in &quot;-logy&quot; almost always add an &quot;-o-&quot;, except when the root word ends in an &quot;l&quot; or a vowel, as in these exceptions: &quot;analogy&quot;, &quot;dekalogy&quot;, &quot;disanalogy&quot;, &quot;genealogy&quot;, &quot;genethlialogy&quot;, &quot;hexalogy&quot;; &quot;herbalogy&quot; (a variant of &quot;herbology&quot;), &quot;mammalogy&quot;, &quot;mineralogy&quot;, &quot;paralogy&quot;, &quot;petralogy&quot; (a variant of &quot;petrology&quot;); &quot;&quot;; ; &quot;antilogy&quot;, &quot;&quot;; &quot;trilogy&quot;, &quot;tetralogy&quot;, &quot;&quot;; &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;; &quot;&quot;; &quot;eulogy&quot;; and &quot;brachylogy&quot;. Linguists sometimes jokingly refer to haplology as &quot;haplogy&quot; (subjecting the word &quot;haplology&quot; to the process of haplology itself).

==Additional usage as a suffix==
Per metonymy, words ending in &quot;-logy&quot; are sometimes used to describe a subject rather than the study of it (e.g., &quot;technology&quot;). This usage is particularly widespread in medicine; for example, &quot;pathology&quot; is often used simply to refer to &quot;the disease&quot; itself (e.g., &quot;We haven&#x27;t found the pathology yet&quot;) rather than &quot;the study of a disease&quot;.

Books, journals, and treatises about a subject also often bear the name of this subject (e.g., the scientific journal &quot;Ecology&quot;).

When appended to other English words, the suffix can also be used humorously to create nonce words (e.g., &quot;beerology&quot; as &quot;the study of beer&quot;). As with other classical compounds, adding the suffix to an initial word-stem derived from Greek or Latin may be used to lend grandeur or the impression of scientific rigor to humble pursuits, as in &quot;cosmetology&quot; (&quot;the study of beauty treatment&quot;) or &quot;cynology&quot; (&quot;the study of dog training&quot;).

==Compound series of works of art==
The -logy or -ology suffix is commonly used to indicate finite series of art works like books or movies. For paintings, the &quot;tych&quot; suffix is more common (e.g. diptych, triptych). Examples include:

*Trilogy for three works
*Tetralogy for four works
*Pentalogy for five works
*Hexalogy for six works
*Heptalogy for seven works

Further terms like duology (two, mostly in genre fiction) quadrilogy (four) and octalogy (eight) have been coined but are rarely used: for a series of 10, sometimes &quot;decalog&quot; is used (e.g. in the Virgin Decalog) instead of &quot;decalogy&quot;.

<doc id="63576" wikidata="Q215959" url="?curid=63576" title="John Stith Pemberton">
<text>John Stith Pemberton (July 8, 1831 – August 16, 1888) was an American pharmacist and Confederate States Army veteran who is best known as the inventor of Coca-Cola. On May 8, 1886, he developed an early version of a beverage that would later become Coca-Cola, but sold the rights to the drink shortly before his death in 1888.

He suffered from a sabre wound sustained in April 1865, during the Battle of Columbus. His efforts to control his chronic pain led to morphine addiction. In an attempt to curb his addiction he began to experiment with various painkillers and toxins. The development of an earlier beverage blending alcohol and cocaine led to the recipe that later was adapted to make Coca-Cola.

==Background==
Pemberton was born on July 8, 1831, in Knoxville, Georgia, and spent most of his childhood in Rome, Georgia. His parents were James C. Pemberton and Martha L. Gant.

Pemberton entered the Reform Medical College of Georgia in Macon, Georgia, and in 1850, at the age of nineteen, he earned his medical degree. His main talent was chemistry. After initially practicing some medicine and surgery, Pemberton opened a drug store in Columbus.

During the American Civil War, Pemberton served in the Third Cavalry Battalion of the Georgia State Guard, which was at that time a component of the Confederate Army. He achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==Personal life==
He met Ann Eliza Clifford &quot;Cliff&quot; Lewis of Columbus, Georgia, known to her friends as &quot;Cliff&quot;, who had been a student at Wesleyan College in Macon. They were married in Columbus in 1853. Their only child, Charles Nay Pemberton, was born in 1854.

They lived in a Victorian cottage, the Pemberton House in Columbus, a home of historic significance which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 28, 1971.

==Founding Coca-Cola==
In April 1865, Pemberton sustained a sabre wound to the chest during the Battle of Columbus. He soon became addicted to the morphine used to ease his pain.

In 1866, seeking a cure for his addiction, he began to experiment with painkillers that would serve as morphine-free alternatives. His first recipe was &quot;Dr. Tuggle&#x27;s Compound Syrup of Globe Flower&quot;, in which the active ingredient was derived from the buttonbush (&quot;Cephalanthus occidentalis&quot;), a toxic plant. He next began experimenting with coca and coca wines, eventually creating a recipe that contained extracts of kola nut and damiana, which he called Pemberton&#x27;s French Wine Coca.

According to Coca-Cola historian Phil Mooney, Pemberton&#x27;s world-famous soda was created in Columbus, Georgia and carried to Atlanta. With public concern about drug addiction, depression, and alcoholism among war veterans, and &quot;neurasthenia&quot; among &quot;highly-strung&quot; Southern women, Pemberton&#x27;s &quot;medicine&quot; was advertised as particularly beneficial for &quot;ladies, and all those whose sedentary employment causes nervous prostration&quot;.

In 1886, when Atlanta and Fulton County enacted temperance legislation, Pemberton had to produce a non-alcoholic alternative to his French Wine Coca. Pemberton relied on Atlanta drugstore owner-proprietor Willis E. Venable to test, and help him perfect, the recipe for the beverage, which he formulated by trial and error. With Venable&#x27;s assistance, Pemberton worked out a set of directions for its preparation. 

He blended the base syrup with carbonated water by accident when trying to make another glassful of the beverage. Pemberton decided then to sell this as a fountain drink rather than a medicine. Frank Mason Robinson came up with the name &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; for the alliterative sound, which was popular among other wine medicines of the time. Although the name refers to the two main ingredients, because of controversy over its cocaine content, The Coca-Cola Company later said that the name was &quot;meaningless but fanciful&quot;. 
Robinson handwrote the Spencerian script on the bottles and ads. Pemberton made many health claims for his product, touting it as a &quot;valuable brain tonic&quot; that would cure headaches, relieve exhaustion, and calm nerves, and marketed it as &quot;delicious, refreshing, pure joy, exhilarating&quot;, and &quot;invigorating&quot;.
==Pemberton sells the business==
Soon after Coca-Cola hit the market, Pemberton fell ill and nearly bankrupt. Sick and desperate, he began selling rights to his formula to his business partners in Atlanta. Part of his motivation to sell was that he still suffered from expensive continuing morphine addiction. Pemberton had a hunch that his formula &quot;someday will be a national drink,&quot; so he attempted to retain a share of the ownership to leave to his son. However, Pemberton&#x27;s son wanted the money, so in 1888, Pemberton and his son sold the remaining portion of the patent to a fellow Atlanta pharmacist, Asa Griggs Candler, for $300 (USD), which in 2022 purchasing power is equal to $9,372.88 (USD).

==Death==

Pemberton died from stomach cancer at the age of 57 on 16 August 1888. At the time of his death, he was poor and had become increasingly addicted to morphine. His body was returned to Columbus, Georgia, where he was buried at Linwood Cemetery. His grave marker is engraved with symbols showing his service in the Confederate Army and his membership as a Freemason. His son Charles continued to sell his father&#x27;s formula, but six years later Charles Pemberton himself died, having succumbed to opium addiction.

<doc id="63577" wikidata="Q34007" url="?curid=63577" title="Cashew">
<text>Cashew is the common name of a tropical evergreen tree Anacardium occidentale, in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to South America and is the source of the cashew nut and the cashew apple, an accessory fruit. The tree can grow as tall as , but the dwarf cultivars, growing up to , prove more profitable, with earlier maturity and greater yields. The cashew nut is edible and is eaten on its own as a snack, used in recipes, or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter. The nut is often simply called a &#x27;cashew&#x27;. The cashew apple is a light reddish to yellow fruit, whose pulp and juice can be processed into a sweet, astringent fruit drink or fermented and distilled into liquor.

In 2023, 3.9 million tons of cashew nuts were harvested globally, led by the Ivory Coast and India. In addition to the nut and fruit, the shell yields derivatives used in lubricants, waterproofing, and paints.

==Description==

The cashew tree is large and evergreen, growing to tall, with a short, often irregularly shaped trunk. The leaves are spirally arranged, leathery textured, elliptic to obovate, long and broad, with smooth margins. The flowers are produced in a panicle or corymb up to long; each flower is small, pale green at first, then turning reddish, with five slender, acute petals long. The largest cashew tree in the world covers an area around and is located in Natal, Brazil.

The fruit of the cashew tree is an accessory fruit (sometimes called a pseudocarp or false fruit). What appears to be the fruit is an oval or pear-shaped structure, a hypocarpium, that develops from the pedicel and the receptacle of the cashew flower. Called the cashew apple, better known in Central America as , it ripens into a yellow or red structure about long.

The true fruit of the cashew tree is a kidney-shaped or boxing glove-shaped drupe that grows at the end of the cashew apple. The drupe first develops on the tree and then the pedicel expands to become the cashew apple. The drupe becomes the true fruit, a single shell-encased seed, which is often considered a nut in the culinary sense. The seed is surrounded by a double-shell that contains an allergenic phenolic resin, anacardic acid - which is a potent skin irritant chemically related to the better-known and also toxic allergenic oil urushiol, which is found in the related poison ivy and lacquer tree.

==Etymology==

The English name derives from the Portuguese name for the fruit of the cashew tree: (), also known as , which itself is from the Tupi word , literally meaning &quot;nut that produces itself&quot;.

The generic name &quot;Anacardium&quot; is composed of the Greek prefix &quot;ana-&quot; (), the Greek &quot;cardia&quot; (), and the Neo-Latin suffix . It possibly refers to the heart shape of the fruit, to &quot;the top of the fruit stem&quot; or to the seed. The word &quot;anacardium&quot; was earlier used to refer to &quot;Semecarpus anacardium&quot; (the marking nut tree) before Carl Linnaeus transferred it to the cashew; both plants are in the same family. The epithet &quot;occidentale&quot; derives from the Western (or Occidental) world.

The plant has diverse common names in various languages among its wide distribution range, including (French) with the fruit referred to as &#x27;, &#x27; (), or &quot;&quot; (Portuguese).

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is native to tropical South America and later was distributed around the world in the 1500s by Portuguese explorers. Portuguese colonists in Brazil began exporting cashew nuts as early as the 1550s. The Portuguese took it to Goa, formerly Estado da Índia Portuguesa in India, between 1560 and 1565. From there, it spread throughout Southeast Asia and eventually Africa.

==Cultivation==
The cashew tree is cultivated in the tropics between 25°N and 25°S, and is well-adapted to hot lowland areas with a pronounced dry season, where the mango and tamarind trees also thrive. The traditional cashew tree is tall, up to , requiring three years from planting before it starts production, and eight years before economic harvests.

More recent breeds, such as the dwarf cashew trees, are up to tall and start producing after the first year, with economic yields after three years. The cashew nut yields for the traditional tree are about per hectare, in contrast to over a ton per hectare for the dwarf variety. Grafting and other modern tree management technologies improve and sustain cashew nut yields in commercial orchards.

===Production===
In 2023, global production of cashew nuts (as the kernel) was 3.9 million tonnes, led by Ivory Coast and India with a combined 46% of the world total (table).

=== Trade ===
Almost all cashews produced in Africa between 2000 and 2019 were exported as raw nuts which are much less profitable than shelled nuts. One of the goals of the African Cashew Alliance is to promote Africa&#x27;s cashew processing capabilities to improve the profitability of Africa&#x27;s cashew industry.

==Toxicity==
Some people are allergic to cashews, but they are a less frequent allergen than other tree nuts or peanuts. For up to 6% of children and 3% of adults, consuming cashews may cause allergic reactions, ranging from mild discomfort to life-threatening anaphylaxis. These allergies are triggered by the proteins found in tree nuts, and cooking often does not remove or change these proteins. Reactions to cashew and tree nuts can also occur as a consequence of hidden nut ingredients or traces of nuts that may inadvertently be introduced during food processing, handling, or manufacturing. 

The shell of the cashew nut contains oil compounds that can cause contact dermatitis similar to poison ivy, primarily resulting from the phenolic lipids, anacardic acid, and cardanol. Because it can cause dermatitis, cashews are typically not sold in the shell to consumers. Readily and inexpensively extracted from the waste shells, cardanol is under research for its potential applications in nanomaterials and biotechnology.

==Uses==

=== Nutrition ===

Raw cashew nuts are 5% water, 30% carbohydrates, 44% fat, and 18% protein (table). In a 100-gram reference amount, raw cashews provide 553 kilocalories, 67% of the Daily Value (DV) in total fats, 36% DV of protein, 13% DV of dietary fiber, and 11% DV of carbohydrates. Cashew nuts are rich sources (20% or more of the DV) of dietary minerals, including particularly copper, manganese, phosphorus, and magnesium (79-110% DV), and of thiamin, vitamin B6, and vitamin K (32-37% DV). Iron, potassium, zinc, and selenium are present in significant content (14-61% DV) (table). Cashews (100g, raw) contain of beta-sitosterol.

=== Nut and shell ===

Culinary uses for cashew seeds in snacking and cooking are similar to those for all tree seeds called nuts.

Cashews are commonly used in South Asian cuisine, whole for garnishing sweets or curries, or ground into a paste that forms a base of sauces for curries (e.g., &quot;korma&quot;), or some sweets (e.g., &quot;kaju barfi&quot;). It is also used in powdered form in the preparation of several Indian sweets and desserts. In Goan cuisine, both roasted and raw kernels of Goa Kaju are used whole for making curries and sweets. Cashews are also used in Thai and Chinese cuisines, generally in whole form. In the Philippines, cashew is a known product of Antipolo and is eaten with &quot;suman&quot;. The province of Pampanga also has a sweet dessert called &quot;turrones de casuy&quot;, which is cashew marzipan wrapped in white wafers. In Indonesia, roasted and salted cashews are called &quot;kacang mete&quot; or &quot;kacang mede&quot;, while the cashew apple is called &quot;jambu monyet&quot; ( &#x27;monkey rose apple&#x27;).

In the 21st century, cashew cultivation increased in several African countries to meet the manufacturing demands for cashew milk, a plant milk alternative to dairy milk. In Mozambique, &quot;bolo polana&quot; is a cake prepared using powdered cashews and mashed potatoes as the main ingredients. This dessert is common in South Africa.

===Husk===
The cashew nut kernel has a slight curvature and two cotyledons, each representing around 20-25% of the weight of the nut. It is encased in a reddish-brown membrane called a husk, which accounts for approximately 5% of the total nut. Cashew nut husk is used in emerging industrial applications, such as an adsorbent, composites, biopolymers, dyes, and enzyme synthesis.

=== Apple ===
The mature cashew apple can be eaten fresh, cooked in curries, or fermented into vinegar, citric acid, or an alcoholic drink. It is also used to make preserves, chutneys, and jams in some countries, such as India and Brazil. In many countries, particularly in South America, the cashew apple is used to flavor drinks, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic.

In Brazil, cashew fruit juice and fruit pulp are used to make sweets, and juice mixed with alcoholic beverages such as &quot;cachaça&quot;, and as flour, milk, or cheese. In Panama, the cashew fruit is cooked with water and sugar for a prolonged time to make a sweet, brown, paste-like dessert called ( being a Spanish name for cashew).

Cashew nuts are more widely traded than cashew apples, because the fruit, unlike the nut, is easily bruised and has a very limited shelf life. Cashew apple juice, however, may be used for manufacturing blended juices.

When the apple is consumed, its astringency is sometimes removed by steaming the fruit for five minutes before washing it in cold water. Steeping the fruit in boiling salt water for five minutes reduces the astringency.

In Cambodia, where the plant is usually grown as an ornamental rather than an economic tree, the fruit is a delicacy and is eaten with salt.

===Alcohol===
In the Indian state of Goa, the ripened cashew apples are mashed, and the juice, called &quot;neero&quot;, is extracted and kept for fermentation for a few days. This fermented juice then undergoes a double distillation process. The resulting beverage is called &quot;feni&quot; or fenny. &quot;Feni&quot; is about 40-42% alcohol (80-84 proof). The single-distilled version is called &quot;urrak&quot;, which is about 15% alcohol (30 proof). In Tanzania, the cashew apple (&quot;bibo&quot; in Swahili) is dried and reconstituted with water and fermented, then distilled to make a strong liquor called &quot;gongo&quot;.

=== Nut oil ===
Cashew nut oil is a dark yellow oil derived from pressing the cashew nuts (typically from lower-value broken chunks created accidentally during processing) and used for cooking or salad dressing. The highest quality oil is produced from a single cold pressing.

=== Shell oil ===
Cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) or cashew shell oil (CAS registry number 8007-24-7) is a natural resin with a yellowish sheen found in the honeycomb structure of the cashew nutshell, and is a byproduct of processing cashew nuts. Since it is a strong irritant, it should not be confused with edible cashew nut oil. It is dangerous to handle in small-scale processing of the shells, but is itself a raw material with multiple uses. It is used in tropical folk medicine and for anti-termite treatment of timber. Its composition varies depending on how it is processed.
* Cold, solvent-extracted CNSL is mostly composed of anacardic acids (70%), cardol (18%), and cardanol (5%).
* Heating CNSL decarboxylates the anacardic acids, producing a technical grade of CNSL that is rich in cardanol. Distillation of this material gives distilled, technical CNSL containing 78% cardanol and 8% cardol (cardol has one more hydroxyl group than cardanol). This process also reduces the degree of thermal polymerization of the unsaturated alkyl-phenols present in CNSL.
* Anacardic acid is also used in the chemical industry for the production of cardanol, which is used for resins, coatings, and frictional materials.

These substances are skin allergens, like lacquer and the oils of poison ivy, and they present a danger during manual cashew processing.

This natural oil phenol has interesting chemical structural features that can be modified to create a wide spectrum of biobased monomers. These capitalize on the chemically-versatile construct, which contains three functional groups: The aromatic ring, the hydroxyl group, and the double bonds in the flanking alkyl chain. These include polyols, which have recently seen increased demand for their biobased origin and key chemical attributes such as high reactivity, range of functionalities, reduction in blowing agents, and naturally occurring fire retardant properties in the field of rigid polyurethanes, aided by their inherent phenolic structure and larger number of reactive units per unit mass.

CNSL may be used as a resin for carbon composite products. CNSL-based novolac is another versatile industrial monomer deriving from cardanol typically used as a reticulating agent (hardener) for epoxy matrices in composite applications providing good thermal and mechanical properties to the final composite material.

=== Animal feed ===
Discarded cashew nuts are unfit for human consumption and the residues of oil extraction from cashew kernels can be fed to livestock. Animals can also eat the leaves of cashew trees.

=== Other uses ===
In addition to its nut and fruit, the plant has several other uses. In Cambodia, the bark gives a yellow dye, the timber is used in boat-making, and for house-boards, and the wood makes excellent charcoal. The shells yield a black oil used as a preservative and water-proofing agent in varnishes, cement, and as a lubricant or timber seal. Timber is used to manufacture furniture, boats, packing crates, and charcoal. Its juice turns black on exposure to air, providing an indelible ink.

<doc id="63578" wikidata="Q312484" url="?curid=63578" title="List of designated terrorist groups">
<text>Several national governments and two international organizations have created lists of organizations that they designate as terrorist. The following list of designated terrorist groups lists groups designated as terrorist by current and former national governments, and inter-governmental organizations. Such designations have often had a significant effect on the groups&#x27; activities.

Many organizations that have been designated as terrorist have denied using terrorism as a military tactic to achieve their goals, and there is no international consensus on the legal definition of terrorism.

This listing does not include unaffiliated individuals accused of terrorism, which is considered lone wolf terrorism. This list also excludes groups which might be widely considered terrorist, but who are not officially designated according to the criteria specified above.

==Organizations designated as terrorist==

===By the United Nations Security Council Committee===
Organizations listed by the United Nations Security Council ISIL (Da&#x27;esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee.


===Other organizations===
==Organizations formerly designated as terrorist==
Below is the list of organizations that have officially been designated as terrorist in the past, by the respective parties, but have since been delisted. 
==Process of designation==
Among the countries that publish a list of designated terrorist organizations, some have a clear established procedure for listing and delisting, and some are opaque. The Berghof Foundation argues that opaque delisting conditions reduce the incentive for the organization to abandon terrorism, while fuelling radicalism.

===Australia===

Since 2002, the Australian Government maintains a list of terrorist organizations under the &quot;Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002&quot;. Listing, de-listing and re-listing follows a protocol that mainly involves the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department.

===Bahrain===

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintains a public list of designated terrorist individuals and entities.

===Canada===
Since 18 December 2001, section 83.05 of the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot; allows the Governor in Council to maintain a list of entities that are engaged in terrorism, facilitating it, or acting on behalf of such an entity.

A review is conducted every five years by the Minister of Public Safety to determine whether an entity should remain listed. Entities may apply for a judicial review by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court. Both ministerial and judicial reviews are published in the &quot;Canada Gazette&quot;. The list is also published on the website of Public Safety Canada.

===European Union===

The European Union has two lists of designated terrorist organisations that provide for different sanctions for the two groups. The first list is copied from the United Nations, and the second is an autonomous list. there are 21 organizations in the autonomous list.

===India===

Under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintains a list of banned organizations.

===Iran===

The state maintains a list of designated terror groups; it includes the US Armed Forces, CENTCOM, Iran International.

===Israel===
The Israeli list of &quot;Terrorists Organizations and Unauthorized Associations&quot; is available at the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel.

===Kazakhstan===

The Government of Kazakhstan publishes a list of terrorist organizations banned by courts.

===Kyrgyzstan===
Kyrgyzstan maintains a consolidated list of &quot;destructive, extremist and terrorist&quot; organizations officially banned by courts. the list includes 21 organizations and 12 of them are recognized as terrorist organizations.

===Malaysia===
The Ministry of Home Affairs of Malaysia maintains a sanction list of individuals and organizations involved in terrorist activity. The list is regulated by the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds From Illegal Activities Act 2001 and is complementary to the United Nations Security Council sanction lists.

===Myanmar===
In Myanmar (formerly &quot;Burma&quot;), the &quot;Anti-Terrorism Central Committee&quot; is responsible for designating terrorist organisations in accordance with the country&#x27;s counter-terrorism law. Designations must be approved by the union government before being official. There are only two groups on Myanmar&#x27;s terror list: the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and Arakan Army, declared on 25 August 2017 and January 2019

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Police are responsible for coordinating any requests to the Prime Minister for designation as a terrorist entity. The designation of terrorist organizations is also guided by the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002. New Zealand also abides by several United Nations resolutions dealing with counter-terrorism including UN Resolutions 1267, 1989, 2253, 1988, and 1373.

===Pakistan===

Government of Pakistan under section 11-B of Anti Terrorism Act can declare an organization believed to be concerned with terrorism as a Proscribed Organization or put it under surveillance. Ministry of Interior issues the formal notification of proscription of an organization. National Counter Terrorism Authority is primarily concerned with monitoring for any signs of re-emergence through intelligence coordination, once an organization is proscribed.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

In 2003, the Ministry of Public Security published a list of &quot;East Turkestan&quot; terrorist organizations on its website mps.gov.cn. This list was translated to English by the Embassy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the US.

===Philippines===

The Department of Foreign Affairs publishes a list of designated terrorist organizations under the Human Security Act or the Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act of 2012.

The passage of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 automatically recognized all terrorist group designations by the United Nations under Philippine law which includes the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Under the same law, the Anti-Terrorism Council was formed to designate groups as terrorists.

===Russia===

A single federal list of organizations recognized as terrorist is used by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. The National Anti-Terrorism Committee maintains a list of terrorist organizations, named &quot;Federal United list of Terrorist Organizations&quot;.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka bans using the &#x27;Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 regulations, cited as the Prevention of Terrorism (Proscription of Extremist Organizations).

===Tajikistan===
The National Bank of Tajikistan publishes national lists of individuals and organizations declared terrorist or extremists by the Supreme Court.

In 2015, the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan was banned in Tajikistan as a terrorist organization.

===United Arab Emirates===

<doc id="63587" wikidata="Q131488" url="?curid=63587" title="Campylobacter">
<text>Campylobacter is a type of bacteria that can cause a diarrheal disease in people. Its name means &quot;curved bacteria&quot;, as the germ typically appears in a comma or &quot;s&quot; shape. According to its scientific classification, it is a genus of gram-negative bacteria that is motile.

The germ is common in nature and in domestic animals. It is frequently found in raw food of vegetable and animal origin. Its numbers can be very high in some foods, like raw poultry. Due to their diverse natural reservoir, some &quot;Campylobacter&quot; can also be detected in the air, although not at an epidemiologically significant level. The disease that some of the species of the bacteria can cause is called campylobacteriosis.

At least a dozen species of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; have been implicated in human disease, with &quot;C. jejuni&quot; (80–90%) and &quot;C. coli&quot; (5–10%) being the most common. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is recognized as one of the main causes of bacterial foodborne disease in many developed countries. It is the number one cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in Europe, with over 246,000 cases confirmed annually. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infection can also cause bacteremia in immunocompromised people, while &quot;C. lari&quot; is a known cause of recurrent diarrhea in children. &quot;C. fetus&quot; can cause spontaneous abortions in cattle and sheep, and is an opportunistic pathogen in humans.

== Morphology and phenotype ==
&quot;Campylobacter&quot; spp. generally appear as curved or comma-shaped rods, and are able to move via unipolar or bipolar flagella. They grow best between 37–42 °C in a microaerophilic environment. When exposed to atmospheric oxygen, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is able to change into a coccus form. Most species of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; are positive by the oxidase test and catalase test and are able to reduce nitrate. The number of known quinolone-resistant &quot;Campylobacter&quot; strains is growing. It is suggested that this is caused by the overuse of quinolone antibiotics in animal agriculture.

== History ==
Theodor Escherich was the first to describe in 1886 what are known today as &quot;Campylobacters&quot; in the stool samples of infants, who perished from a disease he named &quot;cholera infantum&quot;. In the following years until the end of the century, a number of publications appeared, describing the occurrence of such &quot;spirilla&quot; in cases of &quot;cholera-like&quot; and &quot;dysenteric&quot; disease. These organisms were mainly found in the colon or associated with mucus in diarrhoeal stool specimens. &quot;Vibrio&quot;-like bacteria were also described by Sir John McFadyean and Stockman in 1913 in fetal tissues of aborted sheep. For several years Campylobacters were continuously referred to as ‘‘Vibrio-like organisms’’, until 1963 when Sebald and Veron gave the name &quot;Campylobacter&quot; to the genus based on their shape and microaerophilic growth requirement and after showing significant biological differences with &quot;Vibrio&quot; species.

== Genomics ==
The genomes of several &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species have been sequenced, beginning with &quot;C. jejuni&quot; in 2000. These genome studies have identified molecular markers specific to members of &quot;Campylobacter&quot;. &quot;Campylobacter&quot; ssp. genomes are rather small compared to those of other gastrointestinal pathogens, with sizes ranging between 1.60 and 1.90 Mbp. A characteristic of most &quot;Campylobacter&quot; genomes is the presence of hypervariable regions, which can differ greatly between different strains.

Studies have investigated the genes responsible for motility in &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species. Some &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species contain two flagellin genes in tandem for motility, &quot;flaA&quot; and &quot;flaB&quot;. These genes undergo intergenic recombination, further contributing to their virulence. A single Type VI secretion system (T6SS) cluster was also predicted in approximately one-third of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species, grouping into three distinct organisations and harbouring up to five &quot;vgrG&quot; genes.

== Phylogeny ==
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)

Species incertae sedis:
* &quot;C. devanensis&quot; 
* &quot;&quot;C. faecalis&quot; 
* &quot;C. lawrenceae&quot;&quot; 
* &quot;C. magnus&quot; 
* &quot;C. porcelli&quot; 
* &quot;C. vicugnae&quot; 

== &quot;Campylobacter&quot;-specific bacteriophages ==
&quot;Campylobacter&quot;-specific bacteriophages are natural viral predators of the organism. Bacteriophages specific to the species now known as &quot;C. coli&quot; and &quot;C. fetus &quot;(previously &quot;Vibrio coli&quot; and &quot;V. fetus&quot;), were first isolated from cattle and pigs during the 1960s, and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; bacteriophage therapy is an ongoing area of research in the age of bacterial antibiotic resistance.

== Pathogenesis ==
&quot;Campylobacter&quot; can cause a gastrointestinal infection, campylobacteriosis. The incubation period is 24–72 hours after infection. This is characterized by an inflammatory, sometimes bloody diarrhea or dysentery syndrome, mostly including cramps, fever, and pain. The most common routes of transmission are fecal-oral, ingestion of contaminated food or water, and the eating of raw meat. Foods implicated in campylobacteriosis include raw or under-cooked poultry, raw dairy products, and contaminated produce. &quot;Campylobacter&quot; is sensitive to the stomach&#x27;s normal production of hydrochloric acid: as a result, the infectious dose is relatively high, and the bacteria rarely cause illness when a person is exposed to less than 10,000 organisms. Nevertheless, people taking antacid medication (e. g. people with gastritis or stomach ulcers) are at higher risk of contracting disease from a smaller number of organisms, since this type of medication neutralizes normal gastric acid.

In humans, the sites of tissue injury include the jejunum, the ileum, and the colon. Most strains of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; produce cytolethal distending toxin, which inhibits cell division and impedes activation of the immune system. This helps the bacteria to evade the immune system and survive for a limited time inside intestinal cells. &quot;Campylobacter&quot; has, on rare occasions, been suggested to cause hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, though no unequivocal case reports exist. &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infection is the most common trigger of Guillain–Barré syndrome. Gastrointestinal perforation is a rare complication of ileal infection.

&quot;Campylobacter&quot; has also been associated with periodontitis.

== Detection ==
Campylobacter testing needs to be done to manage the risk of foodborne &quot;Campylobacter&quot; and reducing the level of foodborne &quot;Campoboteriosis&quot;, to protect people and to determine if a person is infected with &quot;Campylobacter.&quot;

=== In humans ===
Usually, detection of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; in humans is done by laboratory culturing a stool sample or swab of the rectum collected by a healthcare provider. Results take about 48–72 hours for preliminary results. Confirmation test and testing to determine the species of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; or drug sensitivities of the organism require additional time.

=== In livestock ===
Usually, detection of Campylobacter in livestock is done by laboratory culturing a faecal sample. Results take about 48–72 hours.

=== In meat ===
Usually, detection of Campylobacter in meat is done by laboratory culturing a homogenised sample. Results takes about 48–72 hours.

== Treatment ==
The infection is usually self-limiting and, in most cases, symptomatic treatment by liquid and electrolyte replacement is sufficient to treat human infections. Symptoms typically last 5–7 days. Treatment with antibiotics has only a minor effect on the typical duration of the infection in non-complex cases, and is discouraged except in high-risk patients. 
Diagnosis of campylobacteriosis is made by testing a fecal specimen. Standard treatment in high-risk cases is azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, especially for &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infections in children, although other antibiotics, such as quinolones, tetracycline and other macrolides are sometimes used to treat gastrointestinal &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infections in adults. In case of systemic infection, other bactericidal antibiotics are used, such as ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or aminoglycosides. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, may no longer be effective in some cases, due to resistance. In addition to antibiotics, dehydrated patients may require intravenous fluid treatment in a hospital.

== Epidemiology ==
=== Canada ===
FoodNet Canada has reported that &quot;Campylobacter&quot; was the most common pathogen found on packaged chicken breast, with nearly half of all samples testing positive. Additionally, &quot;Campylobacter&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot; were the most common causes of gastrointestinal illness in Canada.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, the annual prevalence of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infections appears to be relatively stable based on findings from a national survey conducted on more than 5000 isolates. The survey revealed that the most common species of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; were &quot;C. jejuni&quot;, accounting for 83.7% of isolates, followed by &quot;C. coli&quot; (13.5%) and &quot;C. fetus&quot; (0.6%). The mean age of affected patients was 34.61 years, with males constituting 57.1% of cases. Outpatients represented the majority of cases, comprising 54% of the total. &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infections were predominantly isolated from feces, accounting for 97.3% of cases, while a smaller proportion (2.7%) was isolated from blood. Notably, &quot;C. fetus&quot; was primarily isolated from blood samples, constituting 88.2% of cases. Regarding antibiotic resistance patterns, the survey found that resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines was relatively high, with rates of 75.5% and 54.8%, respectively. In contrast, resistance to macrolides, including erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, was lower, with rates ranging from 2% to 4.8%. Additionally, approximately 50% of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; and &quot;C. coli&quot; isolates exhibited resistance to two or more antibiotics. There was a significant decrease in resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines over time, while resistance to macrolides remained stable. 

=== New Zealand ===
In August 2016, an estimated 8,000+ residents of Havelock North, a town with around 13,000 residents, had gastric illness after the water supply was thought to be contaminated by &quot;Campylobacter&quot;.

=== Norway ===
In June 2019, an estimated 2,000 residents of Askøy municipality got sick due to the presence of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; in the water supply. Two deaths were connected to the outbreak, and it was the largest outbreak of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; in Norway. The suspected source of the contamination was thought to be horse faeces, which leaked into a drinking water pool. A &quot;C. jejuni&quot; water isolate thought to be the cause of the outbreak was examined with human isolates, and showed the highest pathogenic potential in vitro, transcriptomic and genomic investigations. This could suggest why the isolate was able to cause an outbreak.

=== Sweden ===
During the period of August 2016 to June 2017 there was a large outbreak of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; in Sweden. It was the largest outbreak that has been reported so far. 5000 more cases than would be expected during this period were reported to the authorities. The source of the outbreak was contaminated chicken meat that came from the same producer. The reason for the increased incidence and elevated levels of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; was reported to be an improperly installed washing plant, where dirty water was accidentally used to wash transport cages.

=== United Kingdom ===
In January 2013, the UK&#x27;s Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned that two-thirds of all raw chicken bought from UK shops was contaminated with &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, affecting an estimated half a million people annually and killing about 100 of them. In June 2014, the FSA started a campaign against washing raw chicken, as washing can spread germs onto clean surfaces by splashing. In May 2015, cumulative results for samples taken from fresh chickens between February 2014 and February 2015 were published by the FSA and showed 73% of chickens tested positive for the presence of &quot;Campylobacter&quot;.

=== United States ===
&quot;Campylobacter&quot; infections increased 14% in the United States in 2012 compared to the rate from 2006 to 2008. This represents the highest reported number of infections since calendar year 2000.

High prevalence of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; (40% or more) has been reported in raw chicken meat in regional retail stores in the US, which remained steady from 2005 through 2011. The last USDA quarterly progress report on &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; testing of meat and poultry, for July–September 2014, showed a low prevalence of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; spp. in ground chicken meat, but a larger prevalence (20%) in mechanically separated chicken meat (which is sold only for further processing).

<text>Jeffrey Gibb Kennett (born 2 March 1948) is an Australian former politician who served as the 43rd Premier of Victoria between 1992 and 1999, Leader of the Victorian Liberal Party from 1982 to 1989 and from 1991 to 1999, and the Member for Burwood from 1976 to 1999. He is currently a media commentator. 

He was previously the president of the Hawthorn Football Club, from 2005 to 2011 and again from 2017 to 2022. He is the founding Chairman of beyondblue, a national mental health advocacy organisation.

== Early life ==
The son of Kenneth Munro Gibb Kennett (1921–2007), and Wendy Anne Kennett (1925–2006; née Fanning), he was born in Melbourne on 2 March 1948. He attended Scotch College; and, although an unexceptional student academically, he did well in the school&#x27;s Cadet Corps Unit. He also played football (on the wing) for the school. His failure to rise above the middle band academically almost led him to quit school in Fourth Form (Year 10 – 1963), but he was persuaded to stay on. His Fifth and Sixth Forms were an improvement, but he was still described in school reports as &quot;[a] confident and at times helpful boy. Sometimes irritates. Sometimes works hard&quot; (1964), and &quot;[a] keen, pleasant, though sometimes erratic boy&quot; (1965).

After leaving school, Kennett was persuaded by his father Ken to attend the Australian National University in Canberra, but lost interest and left after one year of an economics degree. He returned to Melbourne and found work in the advertising department of the retail giant Myer – kindling an interest for advertising that would one day earn him his living.

Kennett&#x27;s life in the regular workforce was cut short when, in 1968, he was conscripted into the Australian Army. Kennett was singled out as &#x27;officer material&#x27; early in his career, and graduated third in his class from the Officer Training Unit, Scheyville (OTU), near Windsor, New South Wales, outside Sydney. He was posted to Malaysia and Singapore as Second Lieutenant, commander of 1st Platoon, A Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR). This military career (and his earlier experience in the Scotch College Cadet Corps) has been noted by many biographers as an essential formative influence on the adult Kennett&#x27;s character. His sense and regard for hierarchical loyalty, punctuality, and general intolerance of dissent or disobedience may be traced to this period.

Kennett returned to civilian life in 1970, reentering a divided Australian society, split by the Vietnam War, of which Kennett was a firm supporter. Having returned to Myer, Kennett became impatient with his work, and so with Ian Fegan and Eran Nicols, he formed his own advertising company (KNF) in June 1971.

Thereafter, in December 1972, Kennett married Felicity Kellar, an old friend whom he had first met on a Number 69 tram on the long trips to school. Their first son was born in 1974, followed by a daughter and two more sons.

== Political career ==
Kennett was elected as a Liberal Member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Burwood in 1976, having had an interest in local politics since the early 1970s. His preselection for the seat reportedly irritated then Premier Dick Hamer, who disliked Kennett&#x27;s campaigning style, and had endorsed the sitting member, Haddon Storey. However, by 1981, Kennett was promoted to Cabinet as Minister for Housing and Minister of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He was one of several younger MPs whom Hamer promoted to Cabinet in a bid to renew his government. Kennett retained his post when Hamer was replaced as Liberal leader and Premier by Lindsay Thompson in June of that year. Following the defeat of the longstanding Liberal government in 1982, Kennett was the leading candidate to replace Thompson despite being the youngest member of the outgoing government. On 26 October, he was elected leader of the Liberal Party and hence Leader of the Opposition. He took an aggressive posture against the Cain government, and was often criticised for his &quot;bull-in-a-china-shop&quot; style and his anti-government rhetoric.

Under his leadership, the Liberals were heavily defeated by Labor in 1985. Afterwards he faced a challenge to his leadership of the party from Ian Smith. Kennett survived easily, but increasingly, he was seen as an erratic and unapproachable leader. He faced two more challenges to his leadership in 1986 and 1987. In 1987, in one notable incident Kennett referred to the Federal Liberal leader John Howard as a &#x27;cunt&#x27; in a mobile telephone conversation with Howard rival Andrew Peacock. The car-phone conversation damaged both Howard and Kennett politically, but aided Peacock in his push to return as Federal Liberal leader (1989).

Toward the end of its second term the Cain government had lost support and the Liberals were expected to win the 1988 election. The Liberal vote indeed rebounded strongly – they won a majority of the two-party vote – however much of this margin was wasted on landslide majorities in their heartland. As a result, the Liberals took only one seat from Labor in the capital, and were left four seats short of a majority. Failing to become premier, Kennett was again criticised within his own party, and in 1989 he was deposed in favour of a little-known rural MLA, Alan Brown.

Kennett&#x27;s performance during his first stint as Liberal leader is a matter of debate. Economou sees his 1985 and 1988 election campaigns as weak, while Parkinson believes he was a significant asset in pushing the Labor government of John Cain in several key seats.

===First term as premier===
Kennett publicly pledged never to attempt a return to the Liberal leadership. However, when Brown proved unable to challenge the government effectively, he allowed his supporters to call a spill in 1991. Brown realised he didn&#x27;t have enough support to keep his post and resigned, allowing Kennett to retake the leadership unopposed.

With Victoria facing billions of dollars of debt, Kennett was seen as &quot;Premier-in-waiting&quot; from the moment he retook the leadership. Cain had resigned a year earlier in favour of Deputy Premier Joan Kirner, who was unable to regain the upper hand despite being personally more popular than Kennett. The Liberals&#x27; advantage was strengthened by an important decision taken during Brown&#x27;s brief tenure as leader—negotiating a Coalition agreement with the National Party. The Liberals and Nationals have historically had a strained relationship in Victoria; they had sat separately for most of the second half of the 20th century. It had been believed that Kennett had been denied victory in 1988 due to a large number of three-cornered contests in rural seats.

The Coalition went into the October 1992 state election as unbackable favourites, having been ahead in opinion polling by large margins for almost two years. They stoked the voters&#x27; anger with a series of &quot;Guilty Party&quot; ads, targeting many Labor ministers and highlighting concerns in their portfolios. In the second-largest defeat that a sitting government has ever suffered in Victoria, the Coalition scored a 19-seat swing, attaining a 16-seat majority in the Legislative Assembly. The Liberals won 52 seats, enough for a majority in their own right. Nevertheless, Kennett supported his coalition partner, retaining the Nationals in his cabinet.

====State school closures====
In the first three years of office, funding for public schools and the Department of Education was substantially reduced. 350 government schools were closed, including every Technical High School (&quot;Tech&quot;) in Victoria, and 7,000 teaching jobs eliminated. The Tech School closures had a widespread, delayed effect two decades later when a skilled labour shortage in the state was declared by the government, attributable largely to the generation of children who were denied a trade-focused high school education, significantly reducing the number of school leavers commencing trade apprenticeships. The few who did so were insufficient to counterbalance the number of retiring tradespeople in the coming years. This directly resulted in the number of Skilled Migrant (subclass 190) visas being made available each year increasing to 190,000 from 2012 and an active campaign to entice migrants with trade qualifications to Victoria.

====Public transport====
Other controversial moves included the sacking of 16,000 public transport workers in a major technological upgrade of the system, and the initiation of a major scheme for privatisation of state-owned services, including the electricity (SECV) and gas (Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria) utilities, the ambulance service, as well as several prisons and other minor services. The sale of the Totalisator Agency Board raised $609 million. Between 1995 and 1998, $29 billion of state assets in gas and electricity alone were sold to private enterprise (for statistics, see Parkinson, &quot;Jeff&quot;, 1999).
In the wake of these changes, investment and population growth slowly resumed, though unemployment was to remain above the national average for the duration of Kennett&#x27;s premiership. While the benefits to the State budget figures were indisputable in the short term, the social and longer-term economic cost of the Kennett reforms have been questioned by many commentators, academics and those who suffered economically through the period of reform. This campaign of privatisations and cutbacks led to governmental acts of privatisation by splitting up Melbourne&#x27;s rail (Hillside, Bayside, V/Line and West Coast Rail) and tramways (Yarra and Swanston) or budget-cutting becoming popularly known as being &quot;Jeffed&quot;. He also cut back many regional rail services including The Vinelander (ran to Mildura, services later restored to Maryborough as a regular V/Line service in 2011) and services to Leongatha, Bairnsdale (returned in 2003), Dimboola (services later returned to Ararat in 2004)

The largest public protest in Melbourne since the Vietnam War Moratorium occurred on 10 November 1992, with an estimated 100,000 people marching in opposition to the retrenchment of many workers and the large State budget cutbacks. Kennett was undeterred by this protest, and famously commented that though there were 100,000 outside his office at Parliament that day, there were 4.5 million who stayed at home or at work.

====High-profile capital works projects====
The Kennett government also embarked on a series of high-profile capital works projects, such as the restoration of Parliament House (never completed), construction of a new $250 million Melbourne Museum (which was widely opposed by the Victorian community at the time) and IMAX theatre, and a new $130 million Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (still known colloquially as &#x27;Jeff&#x27;s Shed&#x27;). Other projects, made possible in monetary terms by the early cutbacks and budget restructuring, included a $160 million expansion of the National Gallery of Victoria; $100 million for refurbishment of the State Library of Victoria; $65 million for a new Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre (MSAC); and $130 million for the construction of a new civic square on the site of the old Gas and Fuel Buildings, to be known as Federation Square.

The relocation of the Formula 1 Grand Prix from Adelaide in 1993 was a particular coup for Kennett, who had worked hard with his friend Ron Walker, the Chairman of the Melbourne Major Events Company, helped deliver Melbourne the hosting rights for the event from Adelaide in 1993.

The most controversial project of the Kennett era was the $1.85 billion Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex, a gambling and entertainment centre on Melbourne&#x27;s Southbank. Initial plans for a casino had been made under the Labor government, however the tendering process and construction occurred under Kennett. Allegations of financial inconsistencies in the tendering process (which eventually saw longtime Kennett supporters Ron Walker and Lloyd Williams successful) were to dog the Kennett government for many years, despite the verdict of an enquiry which found no wrongdoing on its behalf.

A$2 billion project to redevelop Melbourne&#x27;s derelict Docklands area to include a new football stadium was also undertaken, in addition to the large CityLink project, a project resurrected from the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan, aimed at linking Melbourne&#x27;s freeways, easing traffic problems in the inner city, and reducing commuting times from the outer suburbs to the CBD.

====Macedonian name dispute====
thumb|Kennett speaking at a event
In the mid-1990s, Premier Kennett backed the Greek position over the Macedonian question in his attempts to shore up local electoral support. Kennett&#x27;s stance gained him supporters from the Melburnian Greek community, whereas he was referred to as &quot;Kennettopoulos&quot; by the Macedonian community.

At Kennett&#x27;s insistence, his state government in 1994 issued its own directive that all its departments refer to the language as &quot;Macedonian (Slavonic)&quot; and to Macedonians as &quot;Slav Macedonians&quot;. Reasons given for the decision were &quot;to avoid confusion&quot;, be consistent with federal naming protocols toward Macedonians and repair relations between Macedonian and Greek communities. It was accepted that it would not impact the way Macedonians self identified themselves. The decision upset Macedonians, as they had to use the terms in deliberations with the government or its institutions related to education and public broadcasting. The Macedonian Community challenged the decision on the basis of the Race Discrimination Act. After years of litigation at the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC), the Federal Court and High Court, previous judicial rulings were upheld that found Kennett&#x27;s directive unlawful as it caused discrimination based on ethnic background and was struck down from usage in 2000.

===Second term as premier===
Kennett&#x27;s personal popularity was mostly average to high through his first term, though that of the government as a whole went through peaks and troughs. Without a by-election in the previous four years, the 1996 state election shaped up as the first test of the &#x27;Kennett Revolution&#x27; with the electorate. The Coalition was expected to win a second term at the 30 March election, albeit with a somewhat reduced majority. At the federal election held four weeks earlier, while Labor was heavily defeated, it actually picked up a swing in Victoria.

However, to the surprise of most commentators, the Coalition only suffered a two-seat swing, allowing it to retain a comfortable 14-seat majority. The Coalition actually picked up modest swings in Melbourne&#x27;s outer suburbs, which have traditionally decided most state elections. Several negative trends (for the Liberals) were obscured somewhat by the euphoria of victory. The government&#x27;s sharp cuts to government services were particularly resented in country Victoria, where the Liberals and Nationals held almost all the seats. The loss of the Mildura seat to independent Russell Savage was an indication of this disaffection, and when in February 1997 independent Susan Davies was elected to the seat of Gippsland West, this trend seemed set to continue.

However, the verdict of many was that the &#x27;Kennett Revolution&#x27; was far from over – indeed it was seemingly set in stone with the opening of the Crown Casino in May 1997. Kennett&#x27;s profile continued to grow as he became a major commentator on national issues, including urging the new government of John Howard to introduce tax reform, and actively opposing the rise of the One Nation Party of Pauline Hanson. In this last case, Kennett did not shy away from criticising the media, but also the decision of the Howard government to not actively oppose Hanson&#x27;s agenda.

Kennett was influential in Melbourne bidding for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Three cities initially expressed interest in hosting the event; Melbourne, Wellington and Singapore. Singapore dropped out before its bid was officially selected by the Commonwealth Games Federation, leaving only two candidate cities. In the weeks prior to the announcement of the 2006 host, Wellington withdrew its bid, citing the costs involved with matching the bid plan presented by Melbourne, which became the default host without members of the Federation going to vote.

The government lost ground over the next few years, with high-profile disagreements with the Director of Public Prosecutions Bernard Bongiorno, and Auditor-General Ches Baragwanath fuelling criticism of Kennett&#x27;s governmental style. Kennett&#x27;s perceived antipathy to Baragwanath led to 1997 legislation to restructure the office of the Auditor-General and set up Audit Victoria. While Kennett promised the independence of the office would be maintained, many saw his government&#x27;s actions as an attempt to curb the Auditor-General&#x27;s power to criticise government policy. Widespread community debate and substantial public dissent from Liberal MPs and Party members ensued, with MLA Roger Pescott resigning from Parliament at the height of the debate; citing his disagreement with this Bill and Kennett&#x27;s style in general. The Liberal Party lost the by-election in Mitcham.

Further scandals involving the handling of contracts for the state emergency services response system damaged the credibility of Kennett in 1997–1998, while rural dissent continued to grow.

Personal difficulties also began to affect Kennett and his family. The strains of public life led to a trial separation between Felicity and Jeff in early 1998 (patched up by the end of the year), while earlier in Kennett&#x27;s first term, public scrutiny had led to the forced sale of the KNF Advertising Company, despite all Kennett&#x27;s involvement having been transferred to his wife&#x27;s name. There were rumours in 1998 that Kennett might retire from politics; these were mostly centred around Phil Gude, his party deputy. These eventually came to nothing.

In July 1998, Liberal MP Peter McLellan, Member for Frankston East, resigned from the party in protest over alleged corrupt Liberal Party Senate preselection, changes to WorkCover and the auditor-general&#x27;s office. Again, Kennett failed to pick up the warning signs of declining support for his style of leadership.

Labor leader John Brumby took care to capitalise on each of Kennett&#x27;s mistakes over this period, though his absences in rural electorates were misunderstood by many Labor MPs, and led to his replacement by Steve Bracks in early 1999. Bracks, who came from Ballarat, was popular in rural areas and was seen as a fresh alternative to Brumby, who nevertheless remained a key figure in the shadow Cabinet.

===1999 election loss===
Despite Bracks&#x27; appeal, Kennett entered the 1999 election campaign with a seemingly unassailable lead, and most commentators and opinion polls agreed that the Coalition would win a third term.

However, in a shock result, the Coalition suffered a 13-seat swing to Labor. While there was only a modest swing in eastern Melbourne, which has historically decided elections in Victoria, the Coalition suffered significant losses in regional centres such as Ballarat and Bendigo. ABC elections analyst Antony Green later said that when he first saw the results coming in, it looked so unusual that he thought &quot;something was wrong with the computer.&quot;

Initial counting showed Labor on 41 seats and the Coalition on 43; a supplementary election had to be held in Frankston East following the death of sitting independent Peter McLellan. The balance of power rested with three independents--Russell Savage, Susan Davies and newly elected Craig Ingram. Negotiations began between the Coalition and the three independents. While Kennett acceded to all but two of their demands, his perceived poor treatment of Savage and Davies in the previous parliament meant that they would not even consider supporting a Coalition minority government headed by Kennett. On 18 October, two days after Labor won the supplementary election in Frankston East, the independents announced they would support a Labor minority government. The agreement entailed Labor signing a Charter of Good Government, pledging to restore services to rural areas, and promising parliamentary reforms.

Kennett&#x27;s supporters urged the Coalition to force a vote of &#x27;no confidence&#x27; on the floor of the parliament in a last-ditch effort to force Savage, Davies and Ingram to support Kennett. However, with the Liberals divided on Kennett&#x27;s future role, Kennett retired from all of his offices, saying he wished to have no further involvement in politics. Labor won the ensuing by-election in Burwood.

===Rumoured returns to politics===
Following the Liberals&#x27; second successive defeat in the 2002 election, rumours began that Kennett was planning a comeback to politics. The issue came to a head in May 2006 after the sudden resignation of Kennett&#x27;s successor, Robert Doyle, when Kennett announced he would contemplate standing in a by-election for Doyle&#x27;s old seat of Malvern and offering himself as party leader. His stance was supported by Prime Minister John Howard, who rated him as the party&#x27;s best hope to win the November 2006 state election. But within 24 hours Kennett announced he would not return to Parliament rather than running against Ted Baillieu, whom Kennett had been grooming for the top post since 1999. John Howard was reported to have been &quot;embarrassed&quot; by having publicly supported Kennett before his decision not to re-enter politics.

In 2008, it was rumoured that Kennett was planning to stand for Lord Mayor of Melbourne. Despite endorsing future Lord Mayor John So in the 2001 mayoral elections, Kennett was quoted as saying &quot;I think the city is ready for a change&quot;. Kennett claimed he had been approached by &quot;a range of interests&quot; to run for the position, but in the end did not do so. Former Liberal leader Robert Doyle ultimately won the election.

===2020: Indigenous voice to government===
On 15 January 2020, it was announced that Kennett would be one of the members of the National Co-design Group of the Indigenous voice to government.

==Life after politics==

In 2000, Kennett became the inaugural chairman of beyondblue (the National Depression Initiative), a body that was largely formed by the efforts of the Victorian State Government. On 24 June 2008, he announced that he would be stepping down from his role at beyondblue at the end of 2010. This did not happen. After 17 years as the chair of beyondblue, he stood down in 2017, handing the reins to former PM Julia Gillard. He stated &quot;beyondblue is part of my DNA, outside my family, it has been my most important role.

Kennett has previously served on the boards of Australian Seniors Finance, a reverse mortgage company, and SelecTV, which was a satellite television group.

Kennett has said in an interview that he rarely thinks about the media or &quot;bloody history&quot;, though he regrets the &quot;disastrous&quot; introduction of the Metcard ticketing system for trains and trams.

Kennett angered gay rights groups in July 2008 when he supported the Bonnie Doon Football Club in their sacking of trainer Ken Campagnolo for being bisexual; and compared homosexuality to pedophilia. Anti-discrimination campaigner Gary Burns pursued an action in the NSW Administrative Decisions Tribunal against Kennett for making the following statement:

&quot;The club felt that once this had been pointed out and you had this gentleman there who was obviously close to young men – massaging young men – it ran an unnecessary risk, and that&#x27;s why it decided it was best that he not perform those duties again. So the club was trying to do the right thing,&quot;

The case was dropped due to Gary Burns&#x27; lack of funds to pursue the case.

===Hawthorn FC presidency===

On 14 December 2005, Kennett was made president of Hawthorn Football Club, taking over from Ian Dicker.

Following the exit of the St Kilda Football Club from the Tasmanian AFL market in 2006, Kennett was president when the Hawthorn Football Club negotiated a five-year sponsorship deal with the Tasmanian state government. The sponsorship deal was worth an estimated $12 million for which the Tasmanian government bought naming rights to the club&#x27;s guernsey, and the HFC committed to playing an agreed number of pre-season and four regular season &quot;home games&quot; at York Park.

Kennett was instrumental in Hawthorn&#x27;s 2007 5-year business plan titled &quot;five2fifty&quot;, the core idea being that in the next &quot;five&quot; years the club will target to win &quot;2&quot; premierships and have &quot;fifty&quot; thousand members. As part of the plan, the football club wants to be seen as the most professional club in the AFL, and places great emphasis on the welfare of the people associated with the club.

Following Hawthorn&#x27;s 2008 AFL Grand Final victory over , Kennett claimed that the Cats &quot;lacked the mentality to defeat Hawthorn&quot;, this being in reference to the Cats&#x27; inability to counter-attack the running game of the Hawks in the aforementioned Grand Final. Kennett&#x27;s comments led to the subsequent eleven-match losing streak for Hawthorn against Geelong becoming known as the &quot;Kennett curse&quot;.

He stepped down at the end of his second three-year term in 2011, he also changed the club&#x27;s constitution so that presidents could only serve two 3-year terms.

====Second stint====

In what Fox Footy described as a &quot;stunning return&quot;, Kennett was announced as the president of the Hawthorn Football Club on 4 October 2017 following the sudden resignation of the incumbent president Richard Garvey. Garvey had taken criticism on the hiring and later sacking of club CEO Tracey Gaudry. Kennett subsequently appointed Justin Reeves as the club&#x27;s new CEO.

On 4 October 2017 he announced that he would serve the position for a full 3-year term.

Soon after his re-appointment, Kennett and the club released a vision statement outlining the future of the club up to 2050. The first five-year strategic plan titled &#x27;Dare to be Different&#x27; will drive the club&#x27;s priorities from 2018 to 2022.

Kennett said:
On 6 July 2021, Kennett and the Hawthorn board announced that they would not be renewing head coach Alastair Clarkson&#x27;s contract following its expiry at the conclusion of the 2022 AFL Premiership season. It was announced that Box Hill Hawks and Hawthorn development coach, former player Sam Mitchell had been chosen by Kennett and the board to become the Hawthorn coach at the end of Clarkson&#x27;s reign.

=== Chairman of The Original Juice Company ===
On 12 December 2022, The Original Juice Company announced that it would appoint Kennett as Chairman and Non-Executive Director.

==Honours==
In the Australia Day Honours of 2005, Kennett received Australia&#x27;s then highest civilian honour, when he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). The honour was for &quot;service to the Victorian Parliament and the introduction of initiatives for economic and social benefit, to business and commerce, and to the community in the development of the arts, sport and mental health awareness strategies.&quot;

In May 2000, he was also awarded an honorary doctorate – DBus (Honoris Causa) – by the University of Ballarat.

==Media work==
For a brief period during 2002, Kennett was a radio presenter for Melbourne station 3AK, continuing an interest in mass communication which was also a feature of his premiership.

Since 2010, Kennett has been a regular contributor to Neil Mitchell&#x27;s 3AW radio program every Thursday, as a social commentator.

On 28 March 2013 it was announced that Kennett had joined the Seven television network as national political commentator which will involve him appearing on breakfast show Sunrise every Tuesday and on Seven news as required.

On 12 February 2017 Jeff Kennett engaged ex-Seven West Media employee on Twitter over leaked documents potentially breaching the company&#x27;s own gag order on Amber Harrison.

<text>Joan Elizabeth Kirner (née Hood; 20 June 1938 – 1 June 2015) was an Australian politician who was the 42nd Premier of Victoria, serving from 1990 to 1992. A Labor Party member of the Parliament of Victoria from 1982 to 1994, she was a member of the Legislative Council before later winning a seat in the Legislative Assembly. Kirner was a minister and briefly deputy premier in the government of John Cain Jr., and succeeded him as premier following his resignation. She was Australia&#x27;s third female head of government and second female premier, Victoria&#x27;s first, and held the position until her party was defeated in a landslide at the 1992 state election.

==Early life and career==
Born Joan Elizabeth Hood in Essendon, Melbourne, the only child of John Keith and Beryl Edith (née Cole) Hood, a fitter and turner and music teacher, respectively, Kirner was educated at state and private schools. She graduated in arts from the University of Melbourne, and completed a teaching qualification. She taught in state schools and became active in school and parents&#x27; organisations. In 1960 she married Ron Kirner, with whom she had three children. She was President of the Victorian Federation of States School Parents&#x27; Clubs, an influential education lobby from 1971 to 1977 and its executive officer from 1978 to 1982. She was appointed to several government advisory bodies on education.

==Entry into state politics==
Kirner joined the Labor Party in 1978 and became a member of its Socialist Left faction. In 1982, she was elected as a Labor member of the Victorian Legislative Council, the upper house of the Victorian Parliament. In 1985, she was elected to the Cabinet of John Cain Jr.&#x27;s Labor government and became Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands. She proposed the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, the first Australian legislation which gave legal protection of rare species. While Minister, and in association with Heather Mitchell from the Victorian Farmers&#x27; Federation, Kirner was instrumental in the formation of the first Landcare groups.

At the 1988 election, Kirner shifted to the Legislative Assembly, becoming MP for Williamstown, and was promoted to the Education portfolio. In this portfolio Kirner carried out a series of controversial reforms aimed at reducing what Kirner saw as the class-based inequity of the education system, culminating in a new system of assessment, the Victorian Certificate of Education.

==Premiership==
Later in 1988 Kirner was elected deputy leader of the party and became Deputy Premier of Victoria. When Cain resigned after a collapse in his political support in August 1990, Kirner was elected Labor leader and thus became Victoria&#x27;s first female Premier. By this time the Labor government was in deep crisis, with some of the state&#x27;s financial institutions on the brink of insolvency, the budget deficit unsustainably high and growing and the Labor Party deeply divided on how to respond to the situation. The party hoped that the elevation of a popular woman as its new leader would improve its position, but Kirner never succeeded in gaining control of the crisis into which the state had plunged. The conservative-leaning Melbourne newspaper, the &quot;Herald Sun,&quot; reacted unfavourably to a Premier from the Socialist Left, dubbing her &quot;Mother Russia&quot;. She was lampooned alternatively as a sinister commissar and as a frumpy housewife in a polka-dot dress. She seemed unfazed by the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; and gradually won some respect, though she was unable to improve the government&#x27;s standing significantly.

During 1991 and 1992 Kirner took several decisions to cut government spending and raise revenue to some extent, however her government failed to cut spending in many areas including education. Most of the Kirner Government attempts to cut spending were actively opposed by trade unions and some members of the government. The interest bill alone was $3.5 billion per year, the government sold off trains and trams and leased them back. Another decision was the sale of the state-owned State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank in 1991.

Kirner went into 1992 knowing she faced a statutory general election, one which opinion polls gave her virtually no chance of winning. She waited as long as she could, finally calling an election for October. It was obvious as soon as the writs were dropped that Labor would not win a fourth term. Although she remained personally more popular than the Liberal Opposition Leader, Jeff Kennett, it was not nearly enough to overcome Victorians&#x27; growing anger at Labor. The Coalition&#x27;s &quot;Guilty Party&quot; campaign did much to stoke this anger, targeting many Ministers in the Kirner Government and providing examples of concerns in their portfolios.

The campaign attracted controversy with ALP ads stating that if the Liberals won the election it would institute the same policies that were implemented in New Zealand by the then Fourth National Government.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger responded in reference to the campaign, &quot;You know, they say that the show’s never over until the fat lady sings. Well, I think it was her we heard warming up in the wings this week&quot;.

The &quot;fat lady&quot; was in reference to Kirner being overweight. Bolger refused to apologise for this remark citing that he himself was overweight and did not want to make &quot;an international incident&quot; out of it.
It did, however, anger women from Bolger&#x27;s own National Party.

The Coalition won the election in a landslide, scoring a 19-seat swing—the second-worst defeat that a sitting government has ever suffered in Victoria. The Liberals actually won enough seats that they could have governed in their own right. Kirner remained Opposition Leader for a short period before resigning. She retired from Parliament in 1994 and was succeeded by one of her former aides for the electorate of Williamstown, future premier Steve Bracks.

A portrait of Kirner painted by Adelaide artist Annette Bezor in 1994 hangs in Queen&#x27;s Hall at Parliament House Victoria.

==Life after Parliament==

After leaving Parliament, Kirner remained active in community affairs and politics. Initially this led her to a leading role in the Landcare movement. Subsequently, she devoted her energies to the Australian affiliate of EMILY&#x27;s List Australia, an organisation which promotes pro-choice women&#x27;s careers in politics. Kirner was one of the leaders of the movement in the Labor Party to adopt a policy of setting targets for the number of women candidates in winnable electorates. She repeatedly publicly supported candidates identified with her Socialist Left faction.
From January 2006, Kirner was the Chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee for Victorian Communities.

Kirner was also a board member of Museum Victoria, operators of Melbourne Museum, Royal Exhibition Building, Scienceworks Museum and Immigration Museum, Melbourne.
Kirner was a long-time advocate of abortion law reform to legalise abortion. She was an avid supporter of the Essendon Football Club.

In 1993, she famously appeared on &quot;The Late Show&quot; with colleague David White, MLC for Doutta Galla, in a musical skit performing Joan Jett&#x27;s &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. This brief performance was covered nationally by the media.

In an August 2009 interview with GTV-9, Kirner revealed that she had suffered a heavy near-fatal fall at a meeting 18 months earlier. She also revealed that she had osteoporosis and was blind in one eye.

==Death==
In August 2013, it was announced that Kirner had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Kirner died on 1 June 2015, 19 days short of her 77th birthday.

==Honours==
On 26 January 1980, she was named a Member of the Order of Australia for her community service.

On 1 January 2001, Kirner was awarded the Centenary Medal.

On 11 June 2012, she was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for &quot;eminent service to the Parliament of Victoria and to the community through conservation initiatives, contributions to gender equality, the development of education and training programs and the pursuit of civil rights and social inclusion.&quot;

In May 2017, the Victorian Government recognised her legacy by offering 25 scholarships to young women, who will participate in the Joan Kirner Young and Emerging Women Leaders program.

In May 2019, the new specialist maternity and paediatric centre at Sunshine Hospital was named the Joan Kirner Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27;s Hospital.

One of two tunnel-boring machines (TBM) to be utilised on the Metro Tunnel project is named &quot;Joan&quot;, in honour of Kirner. This TBM was officially launched on 15 August 2019.

<text>Johann Christian Günther (8 April 1695 – 15 March 1723) was a German poet from Striegau in Lower Silesia. After attending the gymnasium at Schweidnitz, he was sent in 1715 by his father, a country doctor, to study medicine at Wittenberg; but he was idle and dissipated, had no taste for the profession chosen for him, and came to a complete rupture with his family. In 1717 he went to Leipzig, where he was befriended by Johann Burkhard Mencke (1674–1732), who recognized his genius; and there he published a poem on the peace of Passarowitz (concluded between the German emperor and the Porte in 1718) which acquired him reputation. A recommendation from Mencke to Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, king of Poland, proved worse than useless, as Günther appeared at the audience drunk. From that time he led an unsettled and dissipated life, sinking ever deeper into the slough of misery, until he died at Jena on March 15, 1723, when only in his 28th year. Goethe pronounces Günther to have been a poet in the fullest sense of the term. His lyric poems as a whole give evidence of deep and lively sensibility, fine imagination, clever wit, and a true ear for melody and rhythm; but an air of cynicism is more or less present in most of them, and dull or vulgar witticisms are not infrequently found side by side with the purest inspirations of his genius.

==Works==
*Günther&#x27;s collected poems were published in four volumes (Breslau, 1723–1735).
**They are also included in vol. vi. of Julius Tittmann&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Dichter des 17ten Jahrh.&quot; (Leipzig, 1874), and vol. xxxviii. of Kurschner&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Nationalliteratur&quot; (1883).

<doc id="63596" wikidata="Q16091741" url="?curid=63596" title="John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria)">
<text>John Cain (26 April 1931 – 23 December 2019) was an Australian politician who was the 41st Premier of Victoria, in office from 1982 to 1990 as leader of the Labor Party. During his time as premier, reforms were introduced such as liberalised shop trading hours and liquor laws, equal opportunity initiatives, and occupational health and safety legislation.

==Early life==
Cain was born in Northcote, Victoria, where his father, John Cain, the leader of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria from 1937 to 1957 and three times premier, was the local member. His mother ran a successful chain of millinery stores in the inner north of Melbourne.

He was educated at Bell Primary School, Northcote High School, Scotch College, and at the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in law in 1952. He practised law in suburban Melbourne, and was president of the Law Institute of Victoria in 1972–73. He was also a member of the Law Council of Australia and a member of the Australian Law Reform Commission.

Cain was 24 when the 1955 split in the Labor Party brought down his father&#x27;s last government. He lost a preselection battle with Frank Wilkes for his father&#x27;s seat of Northcote after his father died in 1957.

During the 1960s, he was a member of the group, known as The Participants, which also included John Button, Richard McGarvie, Frank Costigan and Barry Jones, who opposed the left-wing group which controlled the Victorian Labor Party from 1955 onwards. In 1971 he supported moves by supporters of Gough Whitlam, led by Bob Hawke and others, that in 1971 brought about federal intervention in the Victorian branch and ended left-wing control. He became vice-chairman of the Victorian Labor Party in 1973. That group of Participants later became known as the Independents faction which predominantly voted with the Socialist Left.

==Political career==
In 1976, Cain was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as MP for Bundoora. He became shadow Attorney-General under the leadership of Frank Wilkes. After Wilkes narrowly lost the 1979 election to the Liberal premier, Dick Hamer, Cain challenged him for the leadership, becoming leader in September 1981.

Hamer had been forced to resign a few months earlier and was succeeded by deputy premier Lindsay Thompson. However, the Liberals appeared tired and complacent after over a quarter-century in power, and Cain consistently got the better of Thompson. After waiting as long as he could, Thompson called an election for April 1982. At that election, Labor won a sweeping victory on a 17-seat swing—the worst defeat that a non-Labor government has ever suffered in Victoria. Cain took office at the helm of the first Labor government in Victoria since the one led by his father 27 years earlier.

===First term as premier===
During the first term of his government, Cain&#x27;s government carried out many reforms to Victorian government, particularly in the areas of education, environment, law reform and public administration. The Government brought in nude beaches, legalised brothels, extended Saturday shop trading hours, extended nightclub hours, extended hotel hours and allowed Sunday VFL football and more gambling opportunities.

Cain was a Keynesian, opposed to the doctrines of economic rationalism, and he increased government spending in the hope of stimulating growth and investment. Following the lead of New South Wales premier Neville Wran, Cain demanded Government-owned enterprises pay dividends to the treasury, these dividends were increased every year forcing these enterprises to borrow to pay the dividend. Other schemes such as the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, and the Victorian Equity Trust promised good returns. These schemes worked so long as the national economy remained buoyant.

Controversially the Government of Victoria refused to approve the plans for the upgrade of VFL Park in 1982/1983 because the upgrade would threaten the Melbourne Cricket Ground&#x27;s right to host the VFL Grand Final. Cain, who had played Australian football at Scotch College, made sure Waverley Park had no chance to succeed and the MCG remained the number one venue. Cain said that such a major event must be played in the centre of Melbourne, but his real reason for sabotaging Waverley Park was to look after the MCC. He saw his first VFL Grand Final with his father in 1942, and watched every one after that. He also kept the Australian Open in Melbourne by building the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne Park.

Cain forced exclusive male-only sporting clubs like the Melbourne Cricket Club and Victorian Racing Club (VRC) – private clubs on public lands – to accept women as full members. The VRC had notorious lines painted on the ground that women were forbidden to cross. He told the VRC that the lines had to go if they were to ever again receive government funding.

One of Cain&#x27;s major achievements was the introduction of Victoria&#x27;s Freedom of Information laws, making Victoria the first state to pass such laws.

Cain was also responsible for the appointment as Governor of Davis McCaughey, then aged 71, who served from 1986 to 1992. A highly respected theologian, McCaughey was a popular choice after the controversy surrounding the resignation of Rear Admiral Sir Brian Murray, following disputed accusations that he had improperly accepted free air travel.

===Second term===
Historically, Labor had not been very successful in Victoria. However, Cain remained very popular with the Victorian electorate, and was easily elected to a second term in 1985 over the Liberals under Jeff Kennett, the first time a Labor government had been reelected in Victoria. Labor also won the Victorian Legislative Council seat of Nunawading after a tied vote forced the parties to draw from a hat to decide the winner, giving Labor control of the upper house for the first time ever. However, a fresh election was ordered by the Court of Disputed Returns after it was found that the Chief Electoral Officer should have cast deciding vote. The Liberals won the seat, and Labor lost its slim majority. Within a week the chairman of the Victorian Nuclear Disarmament Party lodged an official complaint about a deceptive NDP how to vote card handed out at the booths. It was claimed that Labor members were recognised handing out this card and that the allocation of preferences to the ALP on the card damaged the NDP.

During its second term Cain&#x27;s government began to run into difficulties with the state budget. The stock market crash of 1987 created a crisis which forced the government to cut spending, alienating some trade union supporters. The State Bank of Victoria, in particular its merchant banking arm Tricontinental, ran up a huge portfolio of bad loans, without adequate fiduciary supervision.

Progress had created a vast amount of vacant inner-city land, with the introduction of containerisation in the shipping industry, the docks became inadequate for the new container ships. This made the docks within Victoria Dock obsolete as the principal docking area shifted closer to the mouth of the Yarra, and this was seen as a large urban blight by the Cain state government. The size of the Melbourne Docklands area meant that political influences were inescapable.

The Docklands was high on the government&#x27;s agenda, however, the government at the time could not afford to initiate the investment for the project so the Docklands project stayed on the drawing board. There was a bid for the 1996 Olympic Games and another proposal was to turn the Docklands into a technology city known as the Multifunction Polis (MFP).

===Third term===
The Cain government was narrowly re-elected to a third term in 1988. The Liberals actually won a majority of the two-party vote. However, much of the Liberal margin was wasted on large majorities in their heartland. In contrast, Labor only lost one seat in the capital, and won enough marginal urban seats to cling to power by only two seats. Immediately after the election a huge shortfall in the government&#x27;s workers&#x27; compensation scheme, WorkCare, was revealed.

The VEDC (Victorian Economic Development Corporation), established by the previous Liberal Government, and its sister, the Victorian Investment Corporation, were created to back new industries to replace outdated smokestack manufacturers. The VEDC collapsed under poor management and an absence of accountability after it had provided $450 million of loan and equity assistance to business.

This was followed by a budgetary crisis. The deputy premier, Robert Fordham, took some of the blame and resigned. This led to the elevation of Education Minister Joan Kirner to deputy premier.

For 33 days from 1 January 1990, 250 trams were parked in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD streets by tram drivers. The Cain government wanted to save $24 million a year, by the introduction of a new Met Ticket system – or &quot;scratchies&quot; as they were colloquially known. Scratch tickets were supposed to save money by cutting 550 ticket conductor jobs and 550 train station staff. The trams did not move because the government shut down the power grid.

In February 1990, it was rumoured that Pyramid, a privately owned building society, was in difficulties. Ministers in Cain&#x27;s government accepted assurances from Pyramid directors that the society&#x27;s position was sound, and passed these assurances on to the public. In fact, it was insolvent. When it failed, causing thousands of investors and depositors to lose their money, the government was blamed by investors and the media. This was followed shortly after by the collapse of Tricontinental Bank, which threatened to bankrupt the Victorian Government-owned State Bank, Victoria&#x27;s largest financial institution. The bank eventually had to be sold to the Commonwealth Bank, which was shortly thereafter privatised by the federal government.

By this time Cain was becoming frustrated at the reluctance of his government&#x27;s caucus members to approve his plans for tax rises and spending cuts to reduce the growing budget deficit. He issued an ultimatum at the Labor Party Conference – &quot;back me or sack me.&quot; When the undermining of his position continued, he resigned on 7 August 1990. During an interview after his resignation, he remarked, &quot;We appointed a few dills but we weren&#x27;t crook.&quot; Kirner was elected Labor leader in Cain&#x27;s place and became the first female Premier of Victoria. By this time, Labor had bottomed out at 22 percent in opinion polling. Kirner was unable to make up the lost ground, and Labor was heavily defeated at the 1992 Victorian state election. Cain did not run in this election.

==Life after politics==

Cain did not seek publicity after his retirement from politics. He became a professorial fellow in politics at the University of Melbourne in 1991, and completed three books. In 2004 he surfaced in the media with a damning critique of the University of Melbourne&#x27;s experimentation with what he said were risky financial ventures and what he argued was its departure from its public mission. &quot;Off Course: From Public Place to Marketplace at Melbourne University&quot; attracted a range of critical commentary. He was a regular political commentator on local radio. He remained active in the affairs of the Victorian Labor Party, and in 2011 he was critical of what he saw as the dominance of factions in the party, particularly the Labor Right.

John Cain sat on the board of the Melbourne Cricket Ground Trust. He was also a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria. The John Cain Foundation is a think tank on political affairs of relevance to Victoria

==Personal life==
Cain married Nancye Williams in 1955. He has two sons, John and James and a daughter, Joanne. Cain&#x27;s son, also named John, is a judge of the County Court and also the State Coroner for Victoria.

Cain died on 23 December 2019, aged 88. He had suffered a severe stroke on 10 December and was being cared for at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Cain remains the longest-lived Premier of Victoria.

He has a library named in his honour at Northcote High School, of which he was an alumnus.

A State Memorial Service for the Honourable John Cain, former Premier of Victoria, was held on Monday 3 February 2020 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. On the same day, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced that the Melbourne Multi Purpose Venue would be renamed &quot;John Cain Arena&quot; in recognition of the critical role that Cain played in keeping the Australian Open in Melbourne in the mid-1980s. The new name came into effect in December 2020.

<doc id="63608" wikidata="Q1549819" url="?curid=63608" title="First Balkenende cabinet">
<text>The first Balkenende cabinet was the executive branch of the Netherlands government from 22 July 2002 until 27 May 2003. The cabinet was formed by the Christian-democratic Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the nationalistic Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) and the conservative-liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) after the election of 2002. The cabinet was a right-wing coalition and had a substantial majority in the House of Representatives with Christian Democratic Leader Jan Peter Balkenende serving as Prime Minister. Prominent economist Eduard Bomhoff served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport, while prominent Liberal politician Johan Remkes served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. 

The cabinet served during the early unstable 2000s. Domestically, it had to deal with the fallout of the assassination of Pim Fortuyn, and internationally, with the start of the war on terror. The cabinet suffered several major internal conflicts including multiple cabinet resignations. The internal conflicts between the cabinet members of the Pim Fortuyn List led to the fall of the cabinet just 87 days into its term on 16 October 2002 and it continued in a demissionary capacity until it was replaced following the election of 2003.

==Formation==

On 17 May 2002 Queen Beatrix appointed Member of the Council of State Piet Hein Donner (CDA) as &quot;informateur&quot;, to investigate the possibilities for a new government. A coalition between CDA, LPF and VVD was established relatively quickly, despite some initial resistance by the VVD. By 4 July a detailed coalition agreement had been drawn up and the Queen appointed Jan Peter Balkenende, the lijsttrekker for the CDA, as formateur to form a new cabinet. The cabinet was named on 16 July and was sworn in on 22 July. The first Balkenende cabinet comprised 14 ministers and 14 State Secretaries, with each post allocated to one of the coalition parties. Each of the ministers headed a department, with the exception of one &quot;minister without a portfolio&quot; to deal with &quot;foreigners policy and integration&quot;, accommodated by the Ministry of Justice.

==Term==
===Incidents and scandals===
The first Balkenende cabinet was very unstable from the beginning. Elections had been held in the very recent aftermath of the assassination of Pim Fortuyn, the leader of the newly established Pim Fortuyn List. Emotions in the Netherlands had run very high. The LPF was catapulted into enormous wins, but was unprepared for cabinet participation.

Only three of the 27 cabinet members had previous experience in government, leading to speculation that it wouldn&#x27;t last long. As it turned out, personality conflicts and the general inexperience of LPF cabinet members led to the rapid implosion of the cabinet after a little more than two months.

===Resignation of State Secretary Bijlhout===
The first scandal in the new government came only nine hours after it took office. Philomena Bijlhout, the State Secretary for Social Affairs and Employment and a member of the LPF, resigned after RTL 4 reported that she had been a member of a militia of Surinamese military dictator Dési Bouterse in 1982 and 1983. This was during the period when the militia had committed the political murders known as the &quot;December Murders&quot;. Bijlhout, who was born in Suriname, had never denied being part of the militia, but claimed she&#x27;d left prior to the December Murders.

===Power struggles within the LPF and resignation of the cabinet===
In the months following the election, the LPF was beset by power struggles between various factions. A big incident was when Immigration and Integration Minister Hilbrand Nawijn declared to be in favour of the death penalty. The cabinet was officially opposed to the death penalty. Nawijn responded that he made his remark as leader of the LPF. The party in its turn declared that it was opposed to the death penalty. Nawijn was highly criticised when he declared that it was a personal remark, because it was normal that a minister in a coalition cabinet could make remarks as a party member outside his ministerial responsibility.

In September and October Herman Heinsbroek speculated in public about leading a new party and resigning from the government. This led to tension between him and his supporter Steven van Eyck and Bomhoff. VVD-leader Zalm tried to convince the LPF ministers to replace both Bomhoff and Heinsbroek but his real aim was to use these resignations to call for new elections and to repair the huge losses of his VVD party in the election after the murder of Fortuyn. Disregarding Bomhoff&#x27;s warnings, the other LPF ministers took the bait and told Bomhoff and Heinsbroek to resign, which they did on 16 October. Immediately, Zalm broke his commitment to the remaining LPF ministers to accept replacements for Bomhoff and Heinsbroek and called for fresh elections. Meetings with the Queen did not take place until the week after the resignation, since she had travelled to Italy immediately after the funeral. On 21 October she accepted the resignation and new elections were called for 22 January 2003. The cabinet remained in place as a demissionary cabinet, without Bomhoff and Heinsbroek, until the elections and formation of the second Balkenende cabinet.

On 12 December 2002 Benk Korthals resigned as caretaker Minister of Defence after a commission of inquiry into building industry fraud accused him of giving false information to the Lower House during the previous cabinet. After resigning he said he still denied the allegations.

After the ensuing new elections, the LPF lost two-thirds of its seats in the House of Representatives. The party was never a significant force in Dutch politics again, and dissolved in 2008.

The term of 87 days (counting the first and last days in full and excluding its &quot;caretaker&quot; function that continued for months afterwards) was the shortest since the fifth cabinet of Hendrikus Colijn (25 July 1939 – 10 August 1939).

===Actions===
* Revoking a planned ban on mink farming initiated by the previous cabinet.
* Approval of an expansion of the European Union.
* Support for the United States in its plan to invade Iraq.
* Cuts to Ad Melkert&#x27;s subsidised jobs scheme, the &quot;Melkertbanen&quot;.
* Removal of price controls on certain popular medical interventions (knee and hip operations, cataract operations) in an effort to reduce waiting lists.
* Reorganisation of defence, including budget cuts and the termination of 4800 jobs.
* Reduction of spending on public transport by 39 million euros.
* Cuts to the budgets of most government departments, countered by increased spending in health and some other areas.

<text>Peafowl is a common name for two bird species of the genus &quot;Pavo&quot; and one species of the closely related genus &quot;Afropavo&quot; within the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens. 

The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl from Southeast Asia. The Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin, is not a true peafowl. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;train&quot; of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual.

The functions of the elaborate iridescent coloration and large &quot;train&quot; of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap principle that these features acted as honest signals of the males&#x27; fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.

== Description ==



The Indian peacock (&quot;Pavo cristatus&quot;) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In both species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the &quot;tail&quot;, also known as a &quot;train&quot;. The peacock train consists not of tail quill feathers but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. All species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.

Male green peafowls (&quot;Pavo muticus&quot;) have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, but has shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence. Both males and females have spurs.

The Congo peacock (&quot;Afropavo congensis&quot;) male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.

Chicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically colored. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches of darker brown or light tan and &quot;dirty white&quot; ivory.

Mature peahens have been recorded as suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage and making male calls. Research has suggested that changes in mature birds are due to a lack of estrogen from old or damaged ovaries, and that male plumage and calls are the default unless hormonally suppressed.

=== Iridescence and structural coloration ===
As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colors are not primarily pigments, but structural coloration. Optical interference Bragg reflections, based on regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce the peacock&#x27;s colors. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the layers of the barbules cause the coloration of their feathers. Slight changes to the spacing of the barbules result in different colors. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one color is created by the periodic structure and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical structure rather than pigment can vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.

=== Courtship ===
Most commonly, during a courtship display, the visiting female peahen will stop directly in front of the male peacock, thus providing her with the ability to assess the male at 90° to the surface of the feather. Then, the male will turn and display his feathers about 45° to the right of the sun&#x27;s azimuth which allows the sunlight to accentuate the iridescence of his train. If the female chooses to interact with the male, he will then turn to face her and shiver his train so as to begin the mating process.

=== Evolution===
====Sexual selection ====
Charles Darwin suggested in &quot;The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; that peafowl plumage may have evolved through sexual selection:

==== Aposematism and natural selection ====
It has been suggested that a peacock&#x27;s train, loud call, and fearless behavior have been formed by natural selection (with or without sexual selection too), and served as an aposematic display to intimidate predators and rivals. This hypothesis is designed to explain Takahashi&#x27;s observations that in Japan, neither reproductive success nor physical condition correlate with the train&#x27;s length, symmetry or number of eyespots.

==== Female choice ====
Multiple hypotheses involving female choice have been posited. One hypothesis is that females choose mates with good genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger, brighter peacock trains, tend to have better genes in the peahen&#x27;s eyes. These better genes directly benefit her offspring, as well as her fitness and reproductive success.

Runaway selection is another hypothesis. In runaway sexual selection, linked genes in males and females code for sexually dimorphic traits in males, and preference for those traits in females. The close spatial association of alleles for loci involved in the train in males, and for preference for more exuberant trains in females, on the chromosome (linkage disequilibrium) causes a positive feedback loop that exaggerates both the male traits and the female preferences.

Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a non-mating context that becomes transferred to mating, such as Merle Jacobs&#x27; food-courtship hypothesis, which suggests that peahens are attracted to peacocks for the resemblance of their eye spots to blue berries.

Multiple causalities for the evolution of female choice are also possible.

The peacock&#x27;s train and iridescent plumage are perhaps the best-known examples of traits believed to have arisen through sexual selection, though with some controversy. Male peafowl erect their trains to form a shimmering fan in their display for females. Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signalled a male&#x27;s genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England. The number of eyespots in the train predicted a male&#x27;s mating success. She was able to manipulate this success by cutting the eyespots off some of the males&#x27; tails: females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones. Males with fewer eyespots, thus having lower mating success, suffered from greater predation. She allowed females to mate with males with differing numbers of eyespots, and reared the offspring in a communal incubator to control for differences in maternal care. Chicks fathered by more ornamented males weighed more than those fathered by less ornamented males, an attribute generally associated with better survival rate in birds. These chicks were released into the park and recaptured one year later. Those with heavily ornamented feathers were better able to avoid predators and survive in natural conditions. Thus, Petrie&#x27;s work shows correlations between tail ornamentation, mating success, and increased survival ability in both the ornamented males and their offspring.

Furthermore, peafowl and their sexual characteristics have been used in the discussion of the causes for sexual traits. Amotz Zahavi used the excessive tail plumes of male peafowls as evidence for his &quot;handicap principle&quot;. Since these trains are likely to be deleterious to an individual&#x27;s survival (as their brilliance makes them more visible to predators and their length hinders escape from danger), Zahavi argued that only the fittest males could survive the handicap of a large train. Thus, a brilliant train serves as an honest indicator for females that these highly ornamented males are good at surviving for other reasons, so are preferable mates. This theory may be contrasted with Ronald Fisher&#x27;s hypothesis that male sexual traits are the result of initially arbitrary aesthetic selection by females.

In contrast to Petrie&#x27;s findings, a seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl concluded that female peafowl do not select mates solely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence that peahens preferred peacocks with more elaborate trains (such as with more eyespots), a more symmetrical arrangement, or a greater length. Takahashi determined that the peacock&#x27;s train was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations, and did not correlate with male physiological condition. Adeline Loyau and her colleagues responded that alternative and possibly central explanations for these results had been overlooked. They concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different ecological conditions.

==== Plumage colours as attractants ====
A peacock&#x27;s copulation success rate depends on the colours of his eyespots (ocelli) and the angle at which they are displayed. The angle at which the ocelli are displayed during courtship is more important in a peahen&#x27;s choice of males than train size or number of ocelli. Peahens pay careful attention to the different parts of a peacock&#x27;s train during his display. The lower train is usually evaluated during close-up courtship, while the upper train is more of a long-distance attraction signal. Actions such as train rattling and wing shaking also kept the peahens&#x27; attention.

==== Redundant signal hypothesis ====
Although an intricate display catches a peahen&#x27;s attention, the redundant signal hypothesis also plays a crucial role in keeping this attention on the peacock&#x27;s display. The redundant signal hypothesis explains that whilst each signal that a male projects is about the same quality, the addition of multiple signals enhances the reliability of that mate. This idea also suggests that the success of multiple signalling is not only due to the repetitiveness of the signal, but also of multiple receivers of the signal. In the peacock species, males congregate a communal display during breeding season and the peahens observe. Peacocks first defend their territory through intra-sexual behaviour, defending their areas from intruders. They fight for areas within the congregation to display a strong front for the peahens. Central positions are usually taken by older, dominant males, which influences mating success. Certain morphological and behavioural traits come in to play during inter and intra-sexual selection, which include train length for territory acquisition and visual and vocal displays involved in mate choice by peahens.

== Behaviour ==
Peafowl are forest birds that nest on the ground, but roost in trees. They are terrestrial feeders. All species of peafowl are believed to be polygamous. In common with other members of the Galliformes, the males possess metatarsal spurs or &quot;thorns&quot; on their legs used during intraspecific territorial fights with some other members of their kind.

In courtship, vocalisation stands to be a primary way for peacocks to attract peahens. Some studies suggest that the intricacy of the &quot;song&quot; produced by displaying peacocks proved to be impressive to peafowl. Singing in peacocks usually occurs just before, just after, or sometimes during copulation.

== Diet ==
Peafowl are omnivores and mostly eat plants, flower petals, seed heads, insects and other arthropods, reptiles, and amphibians. Wild peafowl look for their food scratching around in leaf litter either early in the morning or at dusk. They retreat to the shade and security of the woods for the hottest portion of the day. These birds are not picky and will eat almost anything they can fit in their beak and digest. They actively hunt insects like ants, crickets and termites; millipedes; and other arthropods and small mammals. Indian peafowl also eat small snakes.

Domesticated peafowl may also eat bread and cracked grain such as oats and corn, cheese, cooked rice and sometimes cat food. It has been noticed by keepers that peafowl enjoy protein-rich food including larvae that infest granaries, different kinds of meat and fruit, as well as vegetables including dark leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, beans, beets, and peas.

== Cultural significance ==

=== Indian peafowl ===
The peafowl is native to India and significant in its culture. In Hinduism, the Indian peacock is the mount of the god of war, Kartikeya, and the warrior goddess Kaumari, and is also depicted around the goddess Santoshi. During a war with Asuras, Kartikeya split the demon king Surapadman in half. Out of respect for his adversary&#x27;s prowess in battle, the god converted the two halves into an integral part of himself. One half became a peacock serving as his mount, and the other a rooster adorning his flag. The peacock displays the divine shape of Omkara when it spreads its magnificent plumes into a full-blown circular form. In the Tantric traditions of Hinduism the goddess Tvarita is depicted with peacock feathers. A peacock feather also adorns the crest of the god Krishna.

Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan Empire, was born an orphan and raised by a family farming peacocks. According to the Buddhist tradition, the ancestors of the Maurya kings had settled in a region where peacocks (&quot;mora&quot; in Pali) were abundant. Therefore, they came to be known as &quot;Moriyas&quot;, literally, &quot;belonging to the place of peacocks&quot;. According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara (&quot;Moriya-city&quot;), which was so called, because it was built with the &quot;bricks coloured like peacocks&#x27; necks&quot;. After conquering the Nanda Empire and defeating the Seleucid Empire, the Chandragupta dynasty reigned uncontested during its time. Its royal emblem remained the peacock until Emperor Ashoka changed it to a lion, as seen in the Lion Capital of Ashoka, as well in his edicts. The peacock continued to represent elegance and royalty in India during medieval times; for instance, the Mughal seat of power was called the Peacock Throne.

The peacock is represented in both the Burmese and Sinhalese zodiacs. To the Sinhalese people, the peacock is the third animal of the zodiac of Sri Lanka.

Peacocks (often a symbol of pride and vanity) were believed to deliberately consume poisonous substances in order to become immune to them, as well as to make the colours of their resplendent plumage all the more vibrant – seeing as so many poisonous flora and fauna are so colourful due to aposematism, this idea appears to have merit. The Buddhist deity Mahamayuri is depicted seated on a peacock. Peacocks are seen supporting the throne of Amitabha, the ruby red sunset coloured archetypal Buddha of Infinite Light.

India adopted the peacock as its national bird in 1963 and it is one of the national symbols of India.

=== Middle East ===
==== Yazidism ====
Tawûsî Melek (lit. &#x27;Peacock Angel&#x27;) one of the central figures of the Yazidi religion, is symbolized with a peacock. In Yazidi creation stories, before the creation of this world, God created seven Divine Beings, of whom Tawûsî Melek was appointed as the leader. God assigned all of the world&#x27;s affairs to these seven Divine Beings, also often referred to as the Seven Angels or heft sirr (&quot;the Seven Mysteries&quot;).

In Yazidism, the peacock is believed to represent the diversity of the world, and the colourfulness of the peacock&#x27;s feathers is considered to represent of all the colours of nature. The feathers of the peacock also symbolize sun rays, from which come light, luminosity and brightness. The peacock opening the feathers of its tail in a circular shape symbolizes the sunrise.

Consequently, due to its holiness, Yazidis are not allowed to hunt and eat the peacock, ill-treat it or utter bad words about it. Images of the peacock are also found drawn around the sanctuary of Lalish and on other Yazidi shrines and holy sites, homes, as well as religious, social, cultural and academic centres.

==== Mandaeism ====
In &quot;The Baptism of Hibil Ziwa&quot;, the Mandaean uthra and emanation Yushamin is described as a peacock.

=== Ancient Greece ===
Ancient Greeks believed that the flesh of peafowl did not decay after death, so it became a symbol of immortality. In Hellenistic imagery, the Greek goddess Hera&#x27;s chariot was pulled by peacocks, birds not known to Greeks before the conquests of Alexander. Alexander&#x27;s tutor, Aristotle, refers to it as &quot;the Persian bird&quot;. When Alexander saw the birds in India, he was so amazed at their beauty that he threatened the severest penalties for any man who slew one. Claudius Aelianus writes that there were peacocks in India, larger than anywhere else.

One myth states that Hera&#x27;s servant, the hundred-eyed Argus Panoptes, was instructed to guard the woman-turned-cow, Io. Hera had transformed Io into a cow after learning of Zeus&#x27;s interest in her. Zeus had the messenger of the gods, Hermes, kill Argus through eternal sleep and free Io. According to Ovid, to commemorate her faithful watchman, Hera had the hundred eyes of Argus preserved forever, in the peacock&#x27;s tail.

=== Christianity ===
The symbolism was adopted by early Christianity, thus many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock. The peacock is still used in the Easter season, especially in the east. The &quot;eyes&quot; in the peacock&#x27;s tail feathers can symbolise the all-seeing Christian God, the Church, or angelic wisdom. The emblem of a pair of peacocks drinking from a vase is used as a symbol of the eucharist and the resurrection, as it represents the Christian believer drinking from the waters of eternal life. The peacock can also symbolise the cosmos if one interprets its tail with its many &quot;eyes&quot; as the vault of heaven dotted by the sun, moon, and stars. Due to the adoption by Augustine of the ancient idea that the peacock&#x27;s flesh did not decay, the bird was again associated with immortality. In Christian iconography, two peacocks are often depicted either side of the Tree of Life.

The symbolic association of peacock feathers with the wings of angels led to the 
belief that the waving of such liturgical fans resulted in an automated emission of 
prayers. This affinity between peacocks&#x27; and angels&#x27; feathers was also expressed in 
other artistic media, including paintings of angels with peacock feather wings
=== Judaism ===
Among Ashkenazi Jews, the golden peacock is a symbol for joy and creativity, with quills from the bird&#x27;s feathers being a metaphor for a writer&#x27;s inspiration.

=== Renaissance ===
The peacock motif was revived in the Renaissance iconography that unified Hera and Juno, and on which European painters focused.

=== Contemporary ===
In 1956, John J. Graham created an abstraction of an 11-feathered peacock logo for American broadcaster NBC. This brightly hued peacock was adopted due to the increase in colour programming. NBC&#x27;s first colour broadcasts showed only a still frame of the colourful peacock. The emblem made its first on-air appearance on 22 May 1956. The current, six-feathered logo debuted on 12 May 1986.

== Breeding and colour variations ==

Hybrids between Indian peafowl and Green peafowl are called &quot;Spaldings&quot;, after the first person to successfully hybridise them, Keith Spalding. Spaldings with a high-green phenotype do much better in cold temperatures than the cold-intolerant green peafowl while still looking like their green parents. Plumage varies between individual spaldings, with some looking far more like green peafowl and some looking far more like blue peafowl, though most visually carry traits of both.

In addition to the wild-type &quot;blue&quot; colouration, several hundred variations in colour and pattern are recognised as separate morphs of the Indian Blue among peafowl breeders. Pattern variations include solid-wing/black shoulder (the black and brown stripes on the wing are instead one solid colour), pied, white-eye (the ocelli in a male&#x27;s eye feathers have white spots instead of black), and silver pied (a mostly white bird with small patches of colour). Colour variations include white, purple, Buford bronze, opal, midnight, charcoal, jade, and taupe, as well as the sex-linked colours purple, cameo, peach, and Sonja&#x27;s Violeta. Additional colour and pattern variations are first approved by the United Peafowl Association to become officially recognised as a morph among breeders. Alternately-coloured peafowl are born differently coloured than wild-type peafowl, and though each colour is recognisable at hatch, their peachick plumage does not necessarily match their adult plumage.

Occasionally, peafowl appear with white plumage. Although albino peafowl do exist, this is quite rare, and almost all white peafowl are not albinos; they have a genetic condition called leucism, which causes pigment cells to fail to migrate from the neural crest during development. Leucistic peafowl can produce pigment but not deposit the pigment to their feathers, resulting in a blue-grey eye colour and the complete lack of colouration in their plumage. Pied peafowl are affected by partial leucism, where only some pigment cells fail to migrate, resulting in birds that have colour but also have patches absent of all colour; they, too, have blue-grey eyes. By contrast, true albino peafowl would have a complete lack of melanin, resulting in irises that look red or pink. Leucistic peachicks are born yellow and become fully white as they mature.

The black-shouldered or Japanned mutation was initially considered as a subspecies of the Indian peafowl (&quot;P. c. nigripennis&quot;) (or even a separate species (&quot;P. nigripennis&quot;)) and was a topic of some interest during Darwin&#x27;s time. Others had doubts about its taxonomic status, but the English naturalist and biologist Charles Darwin (1809–1882) presented firm evidence for it being a variety under domestication, which treatment is now well established and accepted. It being a colour variation rather than a wild species was important for Darwin to prove, as otherwise it could undermine his theory of slow modification by natural selection in the wild. It is, however, only a case of genetic variation within the population. In this mutation, the adult male is melanistic with black wings.

== Gastronomy ==
In ancient Rome, peafowl were served as a delicacy. The dish was introduced there in approximately 35 B.C. The poet Horace ridiculed the eating of peafowl, saying they tasted like chicken. Peafowl eggs were also valued. Gaius Petronius in his Satyricon also mocked the ostentation and snobbery of eating peafowl and their eggs.

During the Medieval period, various types of fowl were consumed as food, with the poorer populations (such as serfs) consuming more common birds, such as chicken. However, the more wealthy gentry were privileged to eat less usual foods, such as swan, and even peafowl were consumed. On a king&#x27;s table, a peacock would be for ostentatious display as much as for culinary consumption.

From the 1864 &quot;The English and Australian Cookery Book&quot;, regarding occasions and preparation of the bird:

Instead of plucking this bird, take off the skin with the greatest care, so that the feathers do not get detached or broken. Stuff it with what you like, as truffles, mushrooms, livers of fowls, bacon, salt, spice, thyme, crumbs of bread, and a bay-leaf. Wrap the claws and head in several folds of cloth, and envelope the body in buttered paper. The head and claws, which project at the two ends, must be basted with water during the cooking, to preserve them, and especially the tuft. Before taking it off the spit, brown the bird by removing the paper. Garnish with lemon and flowers. If to come on the table cold, place the bird in a wooden trencher, in the middle of which is fixed a wooden skewer, which should penetrate the body of the bird, to keep it upright. Arrange the claws and feathers in a natural manner, and the tail like a fan, supported with wire. No ordinary cook can place a peacock on the table properly. This ceremony was reserved, in the times of chivalry, for the lady most distinguished for her beauty. She carried it, amidst inspiring music, and placed it, at the commencement of the banquet, before the master of the house. At a nuptial feast, the peacock was served by the maid of honour, and placed before the bride for her to consume.

<doc id="63615" wikidata="Q17875" url="?curid=63615" title="Helene (moon)">
<text>Helene is a moon of Saturn. It was discovered by Pierre Laques and Jean Lecacheux in 1980 from ground-based observations at Pic du Midi Observatory, and was designated &#x27;. In 1988 it was officially named after Helen of Troy, who was the granddaughter of Cronus (Saturn) in Greek mythology. Helene is also designated &#x27; (12), which it was given in 1982, and Dione B, because it is co-orbital with Dione and located in its leading Lagrangian point (). It is one of four known trojan moons.
== Exploration ==

Helene was initially observed from Earth in 1980, and &quot;Voyager&quot; flybys of Saturn in the early 1980s allowed much closer views. The &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission, which went into orbit around Saturn in 2004, provided still better views, and allowed more in-depth analysis of Helene, including views of the surface under different lighting conditions. Some of the closest images of Helene to date are from the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft&#x27;s 1800 km flyby on March 3, 2010, and another very successful imaging sequence occurred in June 2011. There were many other approaches over the course of the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission.

== Geology ==

Images of Helene taken by the Cassini spacecraft, with resolutions of up to 24 meters per pixel, show a landscape characterized by broad 2–10km scale depressions with interior slopes no greater than 12°. These basins are likely the decayed remains of old impact craters.

Thin, elongated km-scale raised grooves trace the slopes of many of Helene&#x27;s basins, likely representing mass flow features and indicating that the moon is undergoing active geologic processes such as mass-wasting and erosion. Digital elevation models suggest that the grooves have a positive relief of between 50 and 100 meters. Helene has more than 70 craters, while it shows a bimodal appearance—the heavily cratered trailing hemisphere exhibits a crater density ten times greater than the smooth-looking leading hemisphere.

Simulation models show that the time series of surface activity on Helene is chaotic.

== Surface material ==

Helene&#x27;s surface material is of relatively high reflectance, suggesting grain sizes between 1 and 100 micrometers. Small craters appear somewhat buried, suggesting recent accretional processes of some sort.

Stress-strain laboratory testing of impact-gardened lunar regolith samples shows that at low packing densities, they behave like Non-Newtonian “Bingham” materials, i.e., having the plastic quality of candle-wax and glaciers. This observation suggests that Helene&#x27;s snow-like surface material may behave as a non-Newtonian mass flow and could be primarily responsible for the visible flow patterns seen on its low-gravity surface.

== Selected observations ==

Mostly raw greyscale images with near infrared or ultraviolet channels.

<text>This is a list of [[botanist]]s who have Wikipedia articles, in alphabetical order by surname. The List of botanists by author abbreviation is mostly a list of plant taxonomists because an author receives a standard abbreviation only when that author originates a new plant name.

Botany is one of the few sciences which can boast of, since the Middle Ages, a substantial participation by women.

<text>Vipava (; , ) is a town in western Slovenia. It is the largest settlement and the seat of the Municipality of Vipava. Vipava is located near the numerous sources of the Vipava River, in the upper Vipava Valley, above sea level. Historically, it is part of the traditional region of Inner Carniola, but it is now generally regarded as part of the Slovenian Littoral.

==History==

The region around the town was probably settled by the Illyrians and Celts in the pre-Roman era. Some trace the name Vipava to the Celtic root &quot;vip&quot; (river). In 394, the Battle of the Frigidus took place in the vicinity of the town. In the late 6th century, Slavic tribes, ancestors of modern Slovenes, settled the area. In the late 8th century, the Vipava Valley was included in the Frankish Empire and the Christianization of Slovenes started.

In the Middle Ages, the valley was first included in the Duchy of Friuli. Between 1340 and 1355, Vipava and its surroundings were constantly contended between the Counts of Gorizia, the Patriarches of Aquileia and the Habsburg Duchy of Carniola. Modern Vipava was first mentioned in 1367. In the same period, it was finally included in the County of Gorizia. After a short Venetian interim, Vipava fell under the Habsburg domain in 1501 and in 1535 it was included in Carniola. In the mid-16th century, it emerged as an important center of the Protestant Reformation. It remained part of Carniola until 1918, when it was occupied by the Italian troops and annexed to the Kingdom of Italy.

In the period between 1922 and 1943, it was subjected to a violent policy of Fascist Italianization. Many locals joined the militant antifascist organization TIGR. During World War II, the entire area became an important center of Partisan resistance. In 1945, it was liberated by Partisan troops and in 1947 it became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and of independent Slovenia in 1991.

===Mass graves===
Vipava is the site of five known mass graves from the end of or after the Second World War. The Cemetery Mass Grave () is located next to the southwest wall of the Vipava Cemetery. It contained the remains of eight Slovene civilians murdered by the Yugoslav Army on July 14, 1945. The identities of six victims are known. The remains of six were exhumed in 1999 and reinterred in the cemetery. The Military Cemetery Mass Grave () is located by the west edge of the First World War military cemetery. It contains the remains of 15 Chetnik soldiers killed in late April or early May 1945. Three additional graves contain the remains of German prisoners of war that died of typhus at the nearby prison camp in 1945. The Vipava Field Mass Grave () extends south of the dairy to Močilnik Creek. It is partially covered by the freeway and contains a large number of remains. The Princova Baronovka Mass Grave () lies in the southern part of the town. The Bevk Street Mass Grave () is located at Bevk Streek () no. 16. Human remains were unearthed during excavations for the building there.

==Economy==
Vipava is an important agricultural center of western Slovenia. It is renowned for its wine production. Tourism is also important, as well as small and medium-sized businesses. Many locals work in the nearby town of Ajdovščina.

==Language, culture, and religion==
The vast majority of the people of Vipava, around 93%, are Slovenes. Others are mostly descendants of immigrants from other regions of the former Yugoslavia. Over 96% of the people use Slovene as their first language; among the remaining 4%, most speak Bosnian as their first language. The native inhabitants speak a variant of the Inner Carniolan dialect of Slovene.

Around 77% of the people are Catholic, a little less than 1% are adherents of Sunni Islam, and others are irreligious. The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Stephen and belongs to the Diocese of Koper.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Vipava include:
*Drago Bajc (1904–1928), poet

<doc id="63624" wikidata="Q52631" url="?curid=63624" title="Ibiza">
<text>Ibiza (; ; ; see below) or Iviza is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands in area, but the second-largest by population. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (, or simply ), Santa Eulària des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is above sea level.

Ibiza is well known for its nightlife and electronic dance music club scene in the summer, which attract large numbers of tourists. The island&#x27;s government and the Spanish Tourist Office have worked toward promoting more family-oriented tourism.

Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or &quot;Pityuses&quot;.

==Names and pronunciation==
In British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Peninsular Spanish variant ( ). In American English, the pronunciation is closer to the Latin American Spanish variant ( , , and so forth) and the first syllable is never pronounced as a homophone of &quot;eye&quot;.

Phoenician colonists called the island &quot;Ibossim&quot; or &quot;Iboshim&quot; (cf. Hebrew אִי־בּוֹשֵׂם, &quot;Fragrance Island&quot;), likely due the abundance of aromatic plants on the island. Other speculation is (, , &quot;Dedicated to Bes&quot;). It was later known to Romans as .

The Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the (, probably meaning &quot;Pine-Covered Islands&quot;). The Catalan name and the Spanish name retain this Greek root.

Its name in Catalan is (). The Spanish name is ( in Spain / in Latin America).

In the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as &quot;Ivica&quot;, possibly from an older Spanish orthography with .

==History==

In 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum) and wool.

A shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa&#x27;s commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Mallorca (Majorca), such as &quot;Na Guardis&quot;, and &quot;Na Galera&quot; where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers, to fight for Carthage.

During the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers (Publius and Gnaeus) in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian general Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Muslims in 902. The few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of Dénia—the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community—and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of Dénia for some time (11th century).
Ibiza, together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca, were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon and Alcácer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.

The island was conquered for the Crown of Aragon in 1235. The local Muslim population was deported, as was the case with neighboring Mallorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government&#x27;s autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Mallorca, Menorca and Formentera.

==World Heritage Site==
Though primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 

A notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of Ibiza City, which were awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world&#x27;s few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the medieval wall is still visible. There are some Ibizan cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland. The oceanic plant &quot;Posidonia oceanica&quot; is also part of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage.

==Geography==

Ibiza is a rock island covering an area of , almost one-sixth the size of Mallorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos in the Greek Isles, or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.

Ibiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the Pityusic Islands (&quot;Pitiusas&quot;) or &quot;Pine Islands&quot; composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at .

==Administration==
Ibiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Mallorca. Ibiza comprises five of the region&#x27;s 67 municipalities:

At the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an officially estimated total of 159,180 at the start of 2023, and have a land area of .

The island&#x27;s self-government institution is the Ibiza Island Council (&quot;Consell Insular d&#x27;Eivissa&quot;). Prior to its split in 2007, Formentera was part of the council.

===Insular government===
Elections are held every four years concurrently with local elections. From 1983 to 2007, councilors were indirectly elected from the results of the election to Parliament of the Balearic Islands for the constituencies of Ibiza and Formentera (then forming a single Island council, with Ibiza sending 12 councilors and Formentera a single one). Since 2007, however, separate direct elections are held to elect the Island Council of Ibiza, which has kept 13 as the number of seats (despite sending 12 to the Balearic Parliament).

==People==
Demographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and at the Census of 2021 had reached 154,186. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza; 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile); and the remaining 10 to 15 per cent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears – IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch.

The Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francolí was born in Ibiza, as was the politician and Spain&#x27;s former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes. Notable former residents of Ibiza include: Spandau Ballet&#x27;s Steve Norman, English punk musician Sid Vicious, comic actor Terry-Thomas, Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory, American authors Cormac McCarthy and Clifford Irving.

==Language==
Eivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and immigrants living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages, such as English, French, German and Italian, are widely spoken.

==Tourism==
===Nightlife===
Ibiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island&#x27;s capital on the southern shore, and Sant Antoni to the west. Ibiza has garnered the reputation as the &quot;Party Capital of the world&quot;.

Nightlife in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island&#x27;s opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today&#x27;s club culture may be traced back to hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s. During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take recreational drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented country estates in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.

During the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several venues opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza&#x27;s nightlife. Three of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Amnesia and Es Paradís. These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.

During the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties. The club would close at 18:00 and open again at 07:00, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.

At the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.

In recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music. The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.

Since 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape. Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.

The season now traditionally begins at the end of April, where Opening Parties take place at Ibiza&#x27;s clubs over the course of a three-week period. Opening Parties normally coincide with the culmination of the International Music Summit, a three-day conference promoting the electronic music industry, featuring speakers, masterclasses and performances, and co-hosted by Pete Tong and Jaguar. IMS has taken place on the island annually since 2007 and holds its closing party at the top of Dalt Vila. The first clubs that host opening parties are normally Ushuaïa, Hï, Amnesia, and Pacha. The first parties take place at the end of April, starting with the Hï and Ushuaïa Opening Parties, and the last parties occur around mid-October, usually being the Amnesia and Pacha Closing Parties. Ibiza has recently won numerous awards globally for its world class nightlife venues. The new super clubs including Hi and Ushuaïa, are two of the most notable as of 2024.

=== Other ===
The island&#x27;s government is in the process of making policy changes to encourage a more family-friendly and quieter tourism scene. These include rules such as the closing of all nightclubs by 06:00 at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star. The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.

The island&#x27;s tourism is not always characterized by its nightlife. Visitors can take a hot-air balloon ride, surf, visit the Cave Can Mark, or go to Cap Blanc&#x27;s Aquarium.

==Development==

Since the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Lluís Sert&#x27;s abandoned hotel complex at Cala D&#x27;en Serra, the half-completed and now demolished &quot;Idea&quot; nightclub in Sant Antoni, and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called &quot;Festival Club&quot; that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s. The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andrès has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called &quot;Donde nada ocurre&quot; (Where nothing happens). In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has received an increase in the number of tourists every year, with nearly 6 million people travelling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the &quot;clubbing calendar&quot; which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.

Ibiza&#x27;s increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure. This has led to the imposition of a &quot;Sustainable Tourism Tax&quot; which went into effect on 1 July 2016. Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium on building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal tourist beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island&#x27;s , not much more tourism can be supported.

==Transport==
Ibiza has its own airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union and the United Kingdom.

There are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Mallorca, Dénia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eulària, and Figueretes–Platja d&#x27;en Bossa.

Several public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town, every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d&#x27;en Bossa, Ses Salines, the airport and Santa Eulària. The late night bus line that stops at the various clubs is locally known as the Disco Bus.

==In popular culture==
A number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including: &quot;The Life Impossible&quot; by Matt Haig, &quot;The Canticle of Ibiza&quot; by Justin Kurian, &quot;The White Island&quot; by Stephen Armstrong, &quot;Joshua Then and Now&quot; by Mordecai Richler, &quot;Soma Blues&quot; by Robert Sheckley, &quot;Vacation in Ibiza&quot; by Lawrence Schimel, &quot;A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery&quot; by Hannah Blank, &quot;They Are Ruining Ibiza&quot; by A. C. Greene, and &quot;The Python Project&quot; by Victor Canning. Books including &quot;Ibiza Bohemia&quot;, which was published by Assouline, have explored the island itself with both photography and text, while other such as &quot;Memes Eivissencs&quot; have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.

The third track on Prefab Sprout&#x27;s 1990 album is &#x27;Machine Gun Ibiza&#x27;. It is also mentioned in David Bowie&#x27;s 1971 track &#x27;Life on Mars?&#x27;, &quot;See the mice in their million hordes, from Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads.&quot;

In &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, the opening sketch of Episode 33 features the pilot Biggles. His secretary teasingly calls him &quot;Señor Biggles&quot;, and Biggles protests, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve never even been to Spain.&quot; The secretary responds, &quot; You went to Ibiza last year.&quot; Biggles counters, &quot;That&#x27;s still not grounds for calling me señor, or Don Beeg-les for that matter.&quot;

Wham&#x27;s 1983 hit single &quot;Club Tropicana&quot; music video was filmed in Ibiza. It was the first time George Michael &amp; Andrew Ridgeley would leave the UK.

Vengaboys&#x27; 1999 single &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Ibiza&quot; reached number one on the singles chart in United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The song saw a resurgence in Austria in 2019 due to the Ibiza affair.

The island is shown as the home of notorious art forger, Elmyr de Hory, in the 1973 docudrama &quot;F for Fake&quot; by &quot;Orson Welles&quot;. 

The fourth track off of The Prodigy’s sixth studio album The Day Is My Enemy is titled Ibiza. The song has fast rapping and electronic beats. The rapping is performed by the band’s frontman Keith Flint (died 2019). 

In popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released &quot;I Took a Pill in Ibiza&quot; (alternatively known as &quot;In Ibiza&quot;, or its clean title &quot;I Took a Plane to Ibiza&quot;) in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive &quot;The Truth&quot; EP; it was later released on &quot;At Night, Alone&quot; in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on 24 July 2015. &quot;I Took a Pill in Ibiza&quot; peaked at #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the U.S., and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly &quot;annoyed&quot; by the song&#x27;s apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island&#x27;s culture and how it contrasts with the party &quot;typecast&quot;.

<doc id="63625" wikidata="Q208133" url="?curid=63625" title="Slovenian tolar">
<text>The tolar was the currency of Slovenia from 8 October 1991 until the introduction of the euro on 1 January 2007. It was subdivided into 100 &quot;stotinov&quot; (cents). The ISO 4217 currency code for the Slovenian tolar was &quot;SIT&quot;. From October 1991 until June 1992, the acronym &quot;SLT&quot; was in use.

==History==
The name &quot;tolar&quot; comes from Thaler, and is cognate with &quot;dollar&quot;. The tolar was introduced on 8 October 1991. It replaced the 1990 (Convertible) version of Yugoslav dinar at parity. On 28 June 2004, the tolar was pegged against the euro in the ERM II, the European Union exchange rate mechanism. All recalled banknotes can be exchanged at the central bank for current issue.

===Phase-out===
On 1 January 2007, the tolar was supplanted by the euro. Slovenia issues its own euro coins, like all other nations in the Eurozone.

The timescale for conversion from the tolar to the euro operated differently from the first wave of European Monetary Union (EMU). The permanent euro/tolar conversion rate was finalised on 11 July 2006 at 239.640 tolar per euro. Unlike the
first wave of EMU, this period was only a day (the conversion rates were fixed on 31 December 1998 and euro non-cash payments were possible from 1 January 1999). Also unlike the first wave of EMU which had a three-year transition period (1999–2001), there was no transition period when non-cash payments could be made in both tolar and euro. The tolar was used for all transactions (cash and non-cash) until 31 December 2006 and the euro was compulsory to use for all payments (cash and non-cash) from 1 January 2007. However, as with the first wave of EMU, cash payments with the tolar could continue until 14 January 2007, but change had to be given in euro.

==Coins==
In 1992, coins were introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 stotinov (10, 20 and 50 stotins), 1 tolar, 2 tolarja and 5 tolarjev (2 and 5 tolars). 10 tolarjev (10 tolars) coins were added in 2000, followed by 20 and 50 tolarjev (20 and 50 tolars) in 2003. The obverse designs all show the denomination, with animals native to Slovenia on the reverses. The coins were designed by Miljenko Licul and Zvone Kosovelj and featured reliefs of animals by Janez Boljka.

== Banknotes ==
The first banknotes were provisional payment notes issued on 8 October 1991, in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 5000 tolarjev (0.50 and 2000 tolarjev notes were also printed, but never issued; one thousand sets with matching serial numbers were sold for 5,000 tolarjev each beginning on 6 May 2002). These notes all feature Triglav, the tallest mountain in Slovenia, on the front, and the Prince&#x27;s Stone, honeycomb pattern, and Carniolan honey bee on the back.

In 1992, the Bank of Slovenia introduced the following banknotes, all of which feature notable Slovenes. The banknotes were designed by Miljenko Licul and coauthors, with portraits drawn by Rudi Španzel. They were printed by the British company De La Rue on paper produced in Radeče, Slovenia.

==Historical exchange rates==

Lower number indicates the tolar has a higher value.

*SIT per EUR – 233.0 (April 2006); 239.5 (June 2005); 235.7 (November 2003); 227.3 (June 2002). From 1 January 2007 the rate was irrevocably set at 239.640 and has been finalised by the European Commission.
*SIT per USD – 193.0 (April 2006); 198.0 (June 2005); 201.3 (November 2003); 195.06 (January 2000); 181.77 (1999); 166.13 (1998); 159.69 (1997); 135.36 (1996); 118.52 (1995).

<doc id="63627" wikidata="Q202760" url="?curid=63627" title="Soča">
<text>Soča (, in Slovene) or Isonzo (, in Italian; other names: ; ; or &quot;&quot;) is a long river that flows through western Slovenia () and northeastern Italy ().

An Alpine river in character, its source lies in the Trenta Valley in the Julian Alps in northwestern Slovenia, at an elevation of . The river runs past the towns of Bovec, Kobarid, Tolmin, Kanal ob Soči, Nova Gorica (where it is crossed by the Solkan Bridge), and Gorizia, entering the Adriatic Sea close to the town of Monfalcone. It has a nival-pluvial regime in its upper course and pluvial-nival in its lower course.

Prior to the First World War, the river ran parallel to the border between Kingdom of Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During World War I, it was the scene of bitter fighting between the two countries, culminating in the Battle of Caporetto in October and November 1917.

==Name==
The river was recorded in antiquity as &quot;Aesontius&quot;, &quot;Sontius&quot;, and &quot;Isontius&quot;. Later attestations include &quot;super Sontium&quot; (in 507–11), &quot;a flumine Isontio&quot; (1028), &quot;in Lisonçum&quot; (1261), &quot;an die Ysnicz&quot; (1401), and &quot;an der Snicz&quot; (ca. 1440). The Slovene name &quot;Soča&quot; is derived from the form &quot;*Sǫťa&quot;, which was borrowed from Latin (and Romance) &quot;Sontius&quot;. In turn, this is probably based on the substrate name &quot;*Aisontia&quot;, presumably derived from the PIE root &quot;*&quot; &#x27;swift, rushing&#x27;, referring to a quickly moving river. Another possible origin is the pre-Romance root &quot;*&quot; &#x27;water, river&#x27;.

==Major changes in the watershed==

The present course of the river is the result of several dramatic changes that occurred during the past 2,000 years. According to the Roman historian Strabo, the river named Aesontius, which in Roman times flowed past Aquileia to the Adriatic Sea, was essentially the Natisone and Torre River system.

In 585, a landslide cut off the upper part of the Natisone riverbed, causing its avulsion and subsequent stream capture by the Bontius River. The original subterranean discharge of the Bontius into the Timavo River became obstructed, and another avulsion returned the new watercourse into the bed of the lower Natisone.

During the next centuries the estuary of this new river—the Soča—moved eastward until it captured the short coastal Sdobba River, through which the Isonzo now discharges into the Adriatic Sea. The former estuary (of the Aesontius, and the early Isonzo) in the newly formed lagoon of Grado became an independent coastal rivulet.

==Attractions==

Due to its emerald-green water, the river is marketed as &quot;The Emerald Beauty.&quot; It is said to be one of the rare rivers in the world that retain such a colour throughout their length. Giuseppe Ungaretti, one of the greatest Italian poets, describes the Isonzo in the poem &quot;The Rivers&quot;.

The river inspired the poet Simon Gregorčič to write his best-known poem &quot;Soči&quot; (&quot;To the Soča&quot;), one of the masterpieces of Slovene poetry. This region served as a location for the 2008 Disney film &quot;Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;.

The river is also well known for the marble trout (&quot;Salmo marmoratus&quot;); this species is native to rivers of the northern Adriatic basin, and it lives in the upper course of the river. This species is endangered due to the introduction of other non-indigenous trout species sometime between World War I and World War II.

The Soca Valley is a popular tourist destination due to its numerous natural attractions, including the Big Soča Gorge (), the Little Soča Gorge (), Kozjak Falls, Virje Falls, and the Tolmin Gorges ().

==Significance in World War I==
The valley was the stage of major military operations including the twelve battles of the Isonzo on the Italian front in World War I between May 1915 and November 1917, in which over half a million Austro-Hungarian and Italian soldiers lost their lives.

The Isonzo campaign comprised the following battles:

*First Battle of the Isonzo: 23 June – 7 July 1915
*Second Battle of the Isonzo: 18 July – 3 August 1915
*Third Battle of the Isonzo: 18 October – 3 November 1915
*Fourth Battle of the Isonzo: 10 November – 2 December 1915
*Fifth Battle of the Isonzo: 9–17 March 1916
*Sixth Battle of the Isonzo: 6–17 August 1916
*Seventh Battle of the Isonzo: 14–17 September 1916
*Eighth Battle of the Isonzo: 10–12 October 1916
*Ninth Battle of the Isonzo: 1–4 November 1916
*Tenth Battle of the Isonzo: 12 May – 8 June 1917
*Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo: 19 August – 12 September 1917
*Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo: 24 October – 7 November 1917, also known as the Battle of Caporetto

<doc id="63629" wikidata="Q3618115" url="?curid=63629" title="Kobarid">
<text>Kobarid (; ; ; ) is a settlement in Slovenia, the administrative centre of the Municipality of Kobarid.

Kobarid is known for the 1917 Battle of Caporetto, where the Italian retreat was documented by Ernest Hemingway in his novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. The battle is well documented in the museum in the centre of Kobarid. The museum won a Council of Europe award in 1993.

==Name==
Kobarid was attested in written sources as &quot;Kauoretum&quot; in 1184 (and as &quot;de Cavoreto&quot; in 1258, &quot;Caboret&quot; in 1291, and &quot;de Chiavoretto&quot; in 1343). The Slovenian name is derived from &quot;*Koboridъ&quot;, borrowed from Old Friulian &quot;*Kaborệdu&quot;. The original Romance form of the name, &quot;*Cap(o)rētum&quot;, is probably derived from Latin &quot;caper&quot; &#x27;goat&#x27; and refers to a place where there are goats. The town is known as &quot;Cjaurêt&quot; in Friulian, &quot;Karfreit&quot; in German, and &quot;Caporetto&quot; in Italian.

==Geography==

The municipality is the westernmost in Slovenia, situated in the Julian Alps in the Upper Soča (Isonzo) Valley, at the confluence with the Nadiža (Natisone) River, close to the border with Italy. In the southwest, the road leads to the neighbouring Italian &quot;comune&quot; of Pulfero. The area is located in the north of the historic Goriška region, itself part of the larger Slovene Littoral.
==History==
Kobarid has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological remains from the Hallstatt period have been found in the area. The nearby Tonocov Grad archaeological site has remains of 5th-century Roman buildings, when the area was located in the forefront of the &quot;Claustra Alpium Iuliarum&quot; defense system. The settlement was an important base on the Roman road from &quot;Forum Iulii&quot; (present-day Cividale del Friuli) up to the Predil Pass and the Noricum province.

===Middle Ages===
In the 6th century, the area was settled by Slavic tribes, ancestors of the modern Slovenes. When Kobarid was first mentioned in 1184, it was part of the Patria del Friuli ruled by the Patriarchs of Aquileia.

While the estates in the west were gradually conquered by the Republic of Venice until 1420, Kobarid together with Tolmin County and the possessions of the Counts of Gorizia was incorporated in the Inner Austrian territories of the Habsburg monarchy, like the Slovene-speaking territories of Carniola and Lower Styria.

===Modern time===
From 1754 Kobarid belonged to the newly established Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, a Habsburg crown land which later formed the Austrian Littoral together with the March of Istria and the Imperial Free City of Trieste.

With the exception of a brief period between 1809 and 1813, when it was included under the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, Kobarid remained under Austrian rule until 1918. In the mid-19th century, the town became an important centre of the Slovene national revival.

===World wars===

At the outset of World War I, the area saw one of the first victims of the conflict, Countess Lucy Christalnigg, killed by Landsturmer guards while she was on a mission for the Red Cross. During the war, the whole area was the theatre of the Battles of the Isonzo, fought between the Kingdom of Italy and Austria-Hungary. The town was almost completely destroyed between 1915 and 1917.

After the end of the war in 1918, Kobarid was occupied by the Italian Army, and upon the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye it was officially annexed to Italy and incorporated into the Julian March region. Kobarid was a &quot;comune&quot; of the Province of Gorizia (as Caporetto), except during the period between 1924 and 1927, when the Province of Gorizia was abolished and annexed to the Province of Udine. Between 1922 and 1943, Kobarid was submitted to a policy of violent Fascist Italianization and many locals emigrated to the neighbouring Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The town became one of the crucial centres of recruitment and activity of the militant anti-fascist organization TIGR, which carried out an underground fight against the Italian Fascist regime. During the Italian administration, Kobarid also became an important symbolic place for the Fascist authorities because of its role in World War I. An Italian military ossuary was built on the hill above the town, and Benito Mussolini visited Kobarid in 1938.

Immediately after the Italian armistice in September 1943, Kobarid was liberated by a Partisan uprising, and became the center of large liberated area of around 2,500 square kilometers, known as the Kobarid Republic, administered by the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. During this period, almost all Italian families that settled in Kobarid during the 25 years of Italian administration left the town. In early November 1943, Nazi German forces took over the town and established their rule until May 1945, when the town was finally liberated by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army.

In early June 1945, Kobarid came under joint British–U.S. occupation and placed under Allied temporary military administration until the establishment of a final border between Italy and Yugoslavia. The Morgan Line, which divided the Allied military occupation zone from the Yugoslav one, ran just east of the town, along the Soča River.

In September 1947, the Paris Peace Treaties gave the town to Yugoslavia. Several hundred inhabitants, especially from the Breginj area, chose emigration to Italy rather than becoming citizens of a Communist state.

==Mass grave==
Kobarid was the site of a mass grave from the Second World War. The Cemetery Mass Grave () was in the town cemetery, right of the entrance, between the first and second rows of graves. It contained the remains of 11 German soldiers that fell at Kolovrat in April 1945. Unlike most mass graves in Slovenia, the graves were well maintained during the communist era. The remains were exhumed in 2000 and re-interred in a common grave at Žale Cemetery in Ljubljana.

==Kobarid today==
In the 1960s and 1970s, Kobarid emerged as an important tourist center. In addition to the Kobarid Museum, the Napoleon Bridge has also become an important symbol of Kobarid. The bridge is a popular tourist destination that offers views of the mountains around Kobarid and the Soča River.

With the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, Kobarid became part of independent Slovenia.

<text>Historical linguistics, also known as diachronic linguistics, is the scientific study of how languages change over time. It seeks to understand the nature and causes of linguistic change and to trace the evolution of languages. Historical linguistics involves several key areas of study, including the reconstruction of ancestral languages, the classification of languages into families, (comparative linguistics) and the analysis of the cultural and social influences on language development.

This field is grounded in the uniformitarian principle, which posits that the processes of language change observed today were also at work in the past, unless there is clear evidence to suggest otherwise. Historical linguists aim to describe and explain changes in individual languages, explore the history of speech communities, and study the origins and meanings of words (etymology).

== Development ==

Modern historical linguistics dates to the late 18th century, having originally grown out of the earlier discipline of philology, the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to antiquity. Initially, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of comparative linguistics, primarily as a tool for linguistic reconstruction. Scholars were concerned chiefly with establishing language families and reconstructing unrecorded proto-languages, using the comparative method and internal reconstruction. The focus was initially on the well-known Indo-European languages, many of which had long written histories; scholars also studied the Uralic languages, another Eurasian language-family for which less early written material exists. Since then, there has been significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside of European languages as well, such as on the Austronesian languages and on various families of Native American languages, among many others. Comparative linguistics became only a part of a more broadly-conceived discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a highly specialized field.

Some scholars have undertaken studies attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into Nostratic. These attempts have not met with wide acceptance. The information necessary to establish relatedness becomes less available as the time increases. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed. Several methods are used to date proto-languages, but the process is generally difficult and its results are inherently approximate.

== Diachronic and synchronic analysis ==

In linguistics, a synchronic analysis is one that views linguistic phenomena only at a given time, usually the present, but a synchronic analysis of a historical language form is also possible. It may be distinguished from diachronic, which regards a phenomenon in terms of developments through time. Diachronic analysis is the main concern of historical linguistics. However, most other branches of linguistics are concerned with some form of synchronic analysis. The study of language change offers a valuable insight into the state of linguistic representation, and because all synchronic forms are the result of historically evolving diachronic changes, the ability to explain linguistic constructions necessitates a focus on diachronic processes.
Initially, all of modern linguistics was historical in orientation. Even the study of modern dialects involved looking at their origins. Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s distinction between synchronic and diachronic linguistics is fundamental to the present day organization of the discipline. Primacy is accorded to synchronic linguistics, and diachronic linguistics is defined as the study of successive synchronic stages. Saussure&#x27;s clear demarcation, however, has had both defenders and critics.

In practice, a purely-synchronic linguistics is not possible for any period before the invention of the gramophone, as written records always lag behind speech in reflecting linguistic developments. Written records are difficult to date accurately before the development of the modern title page. Often, dating must rely on contextual historical evidence such as inscriptions, or modern technology, such as carbon dating, can be used to ascertain dates of varying accuracy. Also, the work of sociolinguists on linguistic variation has shown synchronic states are not uniform: the speech habits of older and younger speakers differ in ways that point to language change. Synchronic variation is linguistic change in progress.

Synchronic and diachronic approaches can reach quite different conclusions. For example, a Germanic strong verb (e.g. English &quot;sing&quot; ↔ &quot;sang&quot; ↔ &quot;sung&quot;) is irregular when it is viewed synchronically: the native speaker&#x27;s brain processes them as learned forms, but the derived forms of regular verbs are processed quite differently, by the application of productive rules (for example, adding &quot;-ed&quot; to the basic form of a verb as in &quot;walk&quot; → &quot;walked&quot;). That is an insight of psycholinguistics, which is relevant also for language didactics, both of which are synchronic disciplines. However, a diachronic analysis shows that the strong verb is the remnant of a fully regular system of internal vowel changes, in this case the Indo-European ablaut; historical linguistics seldom uses the category &quot;irregular verb&quot;.

The principal tools of research in diachronic linguistics are the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction. Less-standard techniques, such as mass lexical comparison, are used by some linguists to overcome the limitations of the comparative method, but most linguists regard them as unreliable. The findings of historical linguistics are often used as a basis for hypotheses about the groupings and movements of peoples, particularly in the prehistoric period. In practice, however, it is often unclear how to integrate the linguistic evidence with the archaeological or genetic evidence. For example, there are numerous theories concerning the homeland and early movements of the Proto-Indo-Europeans, each with its own interpretation of the archaeological record.

== Comparative linguistics ==
Comparative linguistics, originally &quot;comparative philology&quot;, is a branch of historical linguistics that is concerned with comparing languages in order to establish their historical relatedness. Languages may be related by convergence through borrowing or by genetic descent, thus languages can change and are also able to cross-relate. Genetic relatedness implies a common origin among languages. Comparative linguists construct language families, reconstruct proto-languages, and analyze the historical changes that have resulted in the documented languages&#x27; divergences. 

== Etymology ==
Etymology studies the history of words: when they entered a language, from what source, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. Words may enter a language in several ways, including being borrowed as loanwords from another language, being derived by combining pre-existing elements in the language, by a hybrid known as phono-semantic matching.

In languages with a long and detailed history, etymology makes use of philology, the study of how words change from culture to culture over time. Etymologists also apply the methods of comparative linguistics to reconstruct information about languages that are too old for any direct information (such as writing) to be known. By analysis of related languages by the comparative method, linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In that way, word roots that can be traced all the way back to the origin of, for instance, the Indo-European language family have been found. Although originating in the philological tradition, much current etymological research is done in language families for which little or no early documentation is available, such as Uralic and Austronesian.

== Dialectology ==
Dialectology is the scientific study of linguistic dialect, the varieties of a language that are characteristic of particular groups, based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. This is in contrast to variations based on social factors, which are studied in sociolinguistics, or variations based on time, which are studied in historical linguistics. Dialectology treats such topics as divergence of two local dialects from a common ancestor and synchronic variation.

Dialectologists are concerned with grammatical features that correspond to regional areas. Thus, they are usually dealing with populations living in specific locales for generations without moving, but also with immigrant groups bringing their languages to new settlements. Immigrant groups often bring their linguistic practices to new settlements, leading to distinct linguistic varieties within those communities. Dialectologists analyze these immigrant dialects to understand how languages develop and diversify in response to migration and cultural interactions.

== Phonology ==

Phonology is a sub-field of linguistics which studies the sound system of a specific language or set of languages. Whereas phonetics is about the physical production and perception of the sounds of speech, phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages. Phonology studies when sounds are or are not treated as distinct within a language. For example, the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;pin&quot; is aspirated, but the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;spin&quot; is not. In English these two sounds are used in complementary distribution and are not used to differentiate words so they are considered allophones of the same phoneme. In some other languages like Thai and Quechua, the same difference of aspiration or non-aspiration differentiates words and so the two sounds, or phones, are considered to be distinct phonemes. In addition to the minimal meaningful sounds (the phonemes), phonology studies how sounds alternate, such as the in English, and topics such as syllable structure, stress, accent, and intonation.

Principles of phonology have also been applied to the analysis of sign languages, but the phonological units do not consist of sounds. The principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of modality because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools, not language-specific ones.

== Morphology and syntax ==

Morphology is the study of patterns of word-formation within a language. It attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of speakers. In the context of historical linguistics, formal means of expression change over time. Words as units in the lexicon are the subject matter of lexicology. Along with clitics, words are generally accepted to be the smallest units of syntax; however, it is clear in most languages that words may be related to one another by rules. These rules are understood by the speaker, and reflect specific patterns in how word formation interacts with speech. In the context of historical linguistics, the means of expression change over time.

Syntax is the study of the principles and rules for constructing sentences in natural languages. Syntax directly concerns the rules and principles that govern sentence structure in individual languages. Researchers attempt to describe languages in terms of these rules. Many historical linguistics attempt to compare changes in sentence between related languages, or find universal grammar rules that natural languages follow regardless of when and where they are spoken.

== Evolutionary context ==
In terms of evolutionary theory, historical linguistics (as opposed to research into the origin of language) studies Lamarckian acquired characteristics of languages. This perspective explores how languages adapt and change over time in response to cultural, societal, and environmental factors. Language evolution within the framework of historical linguistics is akin to Lamarckism in the sense that linguistic traits acquired during an individual&#x27;s lifetime can potentially influence subsequent generations of speakers.

=== Rate of adaptation ===

Historical linguists often use the terms &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;innovative&quot; to describe the extent of change within a language variety relative to that of comparable varieties. Conservative languages change less over time when compared to innovative languages.

<text>The Church of the Nativity, or Basilica of the Nativity, is a basilica located in Bethlehem, West Bank, Palestine. The grotto holds a prominent religious significance to Christians of various denominations as the birthplace of Jesus. The grotto is the oldest site continuously used as a place of worship in Christianity, and the basilica is the oldest major church in the Holy Land.

The church was originally commissioned by Constantine the Great a short time after his mother Helena&#x27;s visit to Jerusalem and Bethlehem in 325–326, on the site that was traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. That original basilica was likely built between 330 and 333, being already mentioned in 333, and was dedicated on 31 May 339. It was probably destroyed by fire during the Samaritan revolts of the sixth century, possibly in 529, and a new basilica was built a number of years later by Byzantine Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), who added a porch or narthex, and replaced the octagonal sanctuary with a cruciform transept complete with three apses, but largely preserved the original character of the building, with an atrium and a basilica consisting of a nave with four side aisles.

The Church of the Nativity, while remaining basically unchanged since the Justinianic reconstruction, has seen numerous repairs and additions, especially from the Crusader period, such as two bell towers (now gone), wall mosaics and paintings (partially preserved). Over the centuries, the surrounding compound has been expanded, and today it covers approximately 12,000 square meters, comprising three different monasteries: one Catholic, one Armenian Apostolic, and one Greek Orthodox, of which the first two contain bell towers built during the modern era.

The silver star marking the spot where Christ was born, inscribed in Latin, was stolen in October 1847 by Greek monks who wished to remove this Catholic item. Some assert that this was a contributing factor in the Crimean War against the Russian Empire. Others assert that the war grew out of the wider European situation.

Since 2012, the Church of the Nativity is a World Heritage Site and was the first to be listed by UNESCO under &#x27;Palestine&#x27;.

Since 1852, the rights of the three religious communities are ruled by Status Quo.
==Base in scripture==
Of the four canonical gospels, Matthew and Luke mention the birth of Jesus, both placing it in Bethlehem. Luke mentions the manger: &quot;and she gave birth to her son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.&quot;

A variant of the narrative is contained in the Gospel of James, an apocryphal infancy gospel.

==History==
===Holy site before Constantine (ca. 4 BC–AD 326)===
The holy site known as the Nativity Grotto is thought to be the manger where Jesus was born. In 135, Emperor Hadrian had the site above the grotto converted into a worship place for Adonis, the mortal lover of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty and desire. Jerome claimed in 420 that the grotto had been consecrated to the worship of Adonis, and that a sacred grove was planted there in order to completely wipe out the memory of Jesus from the world.

Around AD 248, Greek philosopher Origen of Alexandria wrote the following about the grotto:
In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshiped and reverenced by the Christians.

===Constantinian basilica (326 – 529 or 556)===
The first basilica on this site was built by Emperor Constantine I, on the site identified by his mother, Empress Helena and Bishop Makarios of Jerusalem. The construction started in 326 under the supervision of Makarios, who followed Constantine&#x27;s orders, and was dedicated on 31 May 339—however, it had already been visited in 333 by the Bordeaux Pilgrim, at which time it was already in use.

Construction of this early church was carried out as part of a larger project following the First Council of Nicaea during Constantine&#x27;s reign, aimed to build churches on the sites assumed at the time to have witnessed the crucial events in the life of Jesus. The design of the basilica centered around three major architectural sections:

# At the eastern end, an apse in a polygonal shape (broken pentagon, rather than the once proposed, but improbable full octagon), encircling a raised platform with an opening in its floor of ca. 4 metres diameter that allowed direct view of the Nativity site underneath. An ambulatory with side rooms surrounded the apse.
# A five-aisled basilica in continuation of the eastern apse, one bay shorter than the still standing Justinianic reconstruction.
# A porticoed atrium.

The structure was burned and destroyed in one of the Samaritan Revolts of 529 or 556, in the second of which Jews seem to have joined the Samaritans.

===Justinian&#x27;s basilica (6th century)===
The basilica was rebuilt in its present form in the 6th century on the initiative of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527–565), after the destruction of either 529 or 556. It was probably accomplished after the Emperor&#x27;s death, as is indicated by the dating of the wooden elements embedded in the church walls between 545 and 665, which was provided by the dendrochronological analyses made during the recent restoration works.

The Persians under Khosrau II invaded Palestine and conquered nearby Jerusalem in 614, but they did not destroy the structure. According to legend, their commander Shahrbaraz was moved by the depiction above the church entrance of the Three Magi wearing the garb of Persian Zoroastrian priests, so he ordered that the building be spared.

===Crusader period (1099-1187)===
The Church of the Nativity was used as the primary coronation church for Crusader kings, from the second ruler of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1100 and until 1131. In an earlier phase starting from , the Crusaders promoted the redecoration of the building in the medium of wall painting: images of saints were displayed in the central and southern colonnades of the nave, largely on the initiative of private donors, as is shown by the frequent use of dedicatory inscriptions and portraits. Remnants of a cycle of narrative scenes are preserved in the north-western pillar of the choir and the south transepts, as well as in the chapel located below the bell tower.
The Crusaders undertook extensive decoration and restoration on the basilica and grounds, a process that continued until 1169, from 1165 to 1169 even through a sort of &quot;joint venture&quot; between the Latin Bishop of Bethlehem, Raoul, the Latin King Amalric I of Jerusalem and the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos. As detailed in the bilingual Greek and Latin inscription in the altar space, the mosaic decoration was made by a teamwork headed by a painter named Ephraim. Another bilingual, Latin and Syriac, inscription located in the lower half of a mosaic panel displaying an angel in the northern wall of the nave bears witness to the work of a painter named Basil, who was probably a local Syrian Melkite. The two artists collaborated within the same workshop.

===Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (1187-1516)===
The Ayyubid conquest of Jerusalem and its area in 1187 was without consequences for the Nativity church. The Greek-Melkite clergy was granted the right to serve in the church, and similar concessions were given almost immediately also to other Christian denominations.

In the year 1227 the church was embellished with an elegantly carved wooden door, the remnants of which can still be seen in the narthex. As detailed in its double, Armenian and Arabic inscription, it was made by two Armenian monks, Father Abraham and Father Arakel, in the times of King Hethum I of Cilicia (1224-1269) and the Emir of Damascus, and Saladin&#x27;s nephew, al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa.
In 1229 Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II signed an agreement with Sultan al-Kamil which led to the restitution of the Holy Places to the Crusaders. The property of the Nativity Church came back into the possession of the Latin clergy on the condition that Muslim pilgrims may be allowed to visit the holy cave.
Latin hegemony probably lasted until the incursion of Khwarezmian Turks in April 1244. On that occasion, the church treasures, now preserved in the Terra Sancta Museum in Jerusalem, were concealed underground and rediscovered only in 1863. The church was devastated, but not destroyed, the major damage being the dilapidation of its roof.

Under Mamluk rule, the church was used by different Christian denominations, including Greeks, Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians, and Syrians. In 1347 the Franciscans of the newly established Custody of the Holy Land were bestowed with the ownership of the former monastery of the regular canons to the north of the basilica. The Friars managed to gain a hegemonic role in Bethlehem until the Ottoman period.

Starting from the late 13th century, pilgrims lament the dilapidation of the church interior by order of Mamluk authorities: in particular, the marble revetments of the walls and floor were gradually removed, until they thoroughly disappeared.

The Duchy of Burgundy committed resources to restore the roof in August 1448, and multiple regions contributed supplies to have the church roof repaired in 1480: England supplied the lead, the Second Kingdom of Burgundy supplied the wood, and the Republic of Venice provided the labor.

===Ottoman period, first three centuries (16th–18th)===
After the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Nativity church suffered from a long decay. The nave was largely abandoned and used for profane purposes. In the aim to prevent people from entering the church with horses and cattle, the main entrance was walled up and transformed into a diminutive door, known until our days as the &quot;Door of Humility&quot;, since visitors are forced to bend down to go through it. An elevated chancel, provided with three doors, thoroughly separated the nave from the east end of the building, which was reserved for liturgical activities.
The Ottoman period was characterized by increasing tensions between the different Christian denominations. In 1637, Greeks were granted hegemony by the Sublime Porte and the Franciscans were expelled from the holy cave. In 1621 the Armenian Patriarch Grigor Paronter bought the partly ruined buildings to the south of the courtyard and established there a monastery and a hospice for pilgrims. In 1639, the Cretan painter Jeremias Palladas was commissioned by the Greek Patriarch to paint new icons to embellish the church. Further works were made in 1671 on the initiative of Patriarch Dositheos II. In 1675, Dositheos managed to gain control also of the nave, and promoted restorations of the floor and the roof, as well as the making of a new iconostasis. The Franciscans were restored in their rights in 1690, but they lose their hegemony once again in 1757, when the Greek Orthodox were granted full ownership of the upper church and the authorization to keep the keys to the grotto. Afterwards, a redecoration of the church was promoted: the nave was newly paved, the bema was provided with a solemn iconostasis and a wooden baldachin was erected over the main altar.

Because of uninterrupted water infiltrations from the roof, the Crusader mosaics started falling down, as is documented in many pilgrims&#x27; accounts from the 16th century onwards.

===Nineteenth century===
Earthquakes inflicted significant damage to the Church of the Nativity between 1834 and 1837. The 1834 Jerusalem earthquake damaged the church&#x27;s bell tower, the furnishings in the cave on which the church is built, and other parts of its structure. Minor damages were further inflicted by a series of strong aftershocks in 1836 and the Galilee earthquake of 1837. As part of the repairs executed by the Greek Orthodox after receiving a firman in 1842, a wall was built between the nave and aisles, used at the time as a market, and the eastern part of the church containing the choir, which allowed for worship to be continued there.

The religiously significant silver star marking the exact birthplace of Jesus was removed in October 1847 from the Grotto of the Nativity by the Greek Orthodox. The church was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but around Christmas 1852, Napoleon III forced the Ottomans to recognise Catholic France as the &quot;sovereign authority&quot; over Christian holy sites in the Holy Land. The Sultan of Turkey replaced the silver star at the grotto, complete with a Latin inscription, but the Christian Orthodox Russian Empire disputed the change in authority. They cited the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and then deployed armies to the Danube area. As a result, the Ottomans issued firmans essentially reversing their earlier decision, renouncing the French treaty, and restoring to the Orthodox Christians the sovereign authority over the churches of the Holy Land for the time being, thus increasing local tensions—and all this fuelled the conflict between the Russian and the Ottoman empires over the control of holy sites around the region.

===Twentieth century to the present===


In 1918 British governor Colonel Ronald Storrs demolished the wall erected in 1842 by the Greek Orthodox between nave and choir.

The passageway which connects St. Jerome&#x27;s Cave and the Cave of the Nativity was expanded in February 1964, allowing easier access for visitors. American businessman Stanley Slotkin was visiting at the time and purchased a quantity of the limestone rubble, more than a million irregular fragments about across. He sold them to the public encased in plastic crosses, and they were advertised in infomercials in 1995.

During the Second Intifada in April 2002, the church was the site of a month-long siege in which approximately 50 armed Palestinians wanted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took refuge inside the church. Christians in the church gave refuge to the fighters, giving them food, water, and protection from Israeli military forces stationed outside. Israeli media claimed that the Christians inside were being held hostage, however, parishioners inside the church say they and the church were treated with respect.

Curtains caught fire in the grotto beneath the church on 27 May 2014, which resulted in some slight damage.

The church&#x27;s joint owners undertook a major renovation starting in September 2013, probably to be completed in 2021 (see also under Restoration (2013–2019)).

====World Heritage Site====
In 2012, the church complex became the first Palestinian site to be listed as a World Heritage Site by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session on 29 June. It was approved by a secret vote of 13–6 in the 21-member committee, according to UNESCO spokeswoman Sue Williams, and following an emergency candidacy procedure that by-passed the 18-month process for most sites, despite the opposition of the United States and Israel. The site was approved under criteria four and six. The decision was a controversial one on both technical and political terms. It was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger from 2012 to 2019, as it was suffering from damages due to water leaks.

====Restoration (2013–2019)====
=====Endangered status=====
The basilica was placed on the 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund:
The present state of the church is worrying. Many roof timbers are rotting, and have not been replaced since the 19th century. The rainwater that seeps into the building not only accelerates the rotting of the wood and damages the structural integrity of the building, but also damages the 12th-century wall mosaics and paintings. The influx of water also means that there is an ever-present chance of an electrical fire. If another earthquake were to occur on the scale of the one of 1834, the result would most likely be catastrophic. ... It is hoped that the listing will encourage its preservation, including getting the three custodians of the church—the Greek Orthodox Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, and the Franciscan order—to work together, which has not happened for hundreds of years. The Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority would also have to work together to protect it.
A Presidential committee for the restoration of the Nativity Church was appointed in 2008. In the following year, an international consortium team of experts from different Universities, under the supervision of Prof. Claudio Alessandri (University of Ferrara, Italy), was given the task of planning and coordinating the restoration works.

=====Logistics and organisation=====
In 2010, the Palestinian Authority announced that a multimillion-dollar restoration programme was imminent. Although a majority Muslim nation, albeit with a significant Christian minority, Palestinians consider the church a national treasure and one of their most visited tourist sites. President Mahmoud Abbas has been actively involved in the project, which is led by Ziad al-Bandak. The project is partially funded by Palestinians and conducted by a team of Palestinian and international experts.

=====Restoration process=====
The initial phase of the restoration work was completed in early 2016. New windows have been installed, structural repairs on the roof have been completed and art works and mosaics have been cleaned and restored. The works went further with the consolidation of the narthex, the cleaning and consolidation of all wooden elements, the cleaning of wall mosaics, mural paintings, and floor mosaics. The works came to pause in 2021; however there is still restoration work to be done as of June 2024. The remaining goals of the project include: the conservation of the stone tiles of the Church of the Nativity’s front yard, the addition of a firefighting system, a climate control system, structural consolidation, further prevention of seismic activity damage, and the restoration of the central nave. The most necessary of the repairs yet to be done is restoration of the Grotto of the Nativity.

=====Discoveries=====
Italian restoration workers uncovered a seventh surviving mosaic angel in July 2016, which was previously hidden under plaster. According to the Italian restorer Marcello Piacenti, the mosaics &quot;are made of gold leaf placed between two glass plates&quot; and solely &quot;faces and limbs are drawn with small pieces of stone.&quot;

==Property and administration==
The property rights, liturgical use and maintenance of the church are regulated by a set of documents and understandings known as the Status Quo. The church is owned by three church authorities, the Greek Orthodox (most of the building and furnishings), the Catholic and the Armenian Apostolic (each of them with lesser properties). The Coptic Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox are holding minor rights of worship at the Armenian church in the northern transept, and at the Altar of Nativity.
There have been repeated brawls among monk trainees over quiet respect for others&#x27; prayers, hymns and even the division of floor space for cleaning duties. The Palestinian police are often called to restore peace and order.

==Site architecture and layout==
The centrepiece of the Nativity complex is the Grotto of the Nativity, a cave which enshrines the site where Jesus is said to have been born.

The core of the complex connected to the Grotto consists of the Church of the Nativity itself, and the adjoining Catholic Church of St. Catherine north of it.

===Outer courtyard===
Bethlehem&#x27;s main city square, Manger Square, is an extension of the large paved courtyard in front of the Church of the Nativity and St Catherine&#x27;s. Here crowds gather on Christmas Eve to sing Christmas carols in anticipation of the midnight services.

===Basilica of the Nativity===

The main Basilica of the Nativity is maintained by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It is designed like a typical Roman basilica, with five aisles formed by Corinthian columns, and an apse in the eastern end containing the sanctuary.

The basilica is entered through a very low door called the &quot;Door of Humility.&quot;

The church&#x27;s interior walls feature medieval golden mosaics once covering the side walls, which are now in large parts lost.

The original Roman-style floor of the basilica has been covered over with flagstones, but there is a trap door in the floor which opens up to reveal a portion of the original mosaic pavement from the Constantinian basilica.

There are 44 columns separating the aisles from each other and from the nave, some of which are painted with images of saints, such as the Irish monk Catald (fl. 7th century), the patron of the Sicilian Normans, Canute IV (c. 1042–1086), king of Denmark, and Olaf II (995–1030), king of Norway.

The east end of the church consists of a raised chancel, closed by an apse containing the main altar and separated from the chancel by a large gilded iconostasis.

A complex array of sanctuary lamps is placed throughout the entire building.

The open ceiling exposes the wooden rafters, recently restored. The previous 15th-century restoration used beams donated by King Edward IV of England, who also donated lead to cover the roof; however, this lead was taken by the Ottoman Turks, who melted it down for ammunition to use in war against Venice.

Stairways on either side of the chancel lead down to the Grotto.

===Grotto of the Nativity===
The Grotto of the Nativity, the place where Jesus is said to have been born, is an underground space which forms the crypt of the Church of the Nativity. It is situated underneath its main altar, and it is normally accessed by two staircases on either side of the chancel. The grotto is part of a network of caves, which are accessed from the adjacent Church St Catherine&#x27;s. The tunnel-like corridor connecting the Grotto to the other caves is normally locked.

The cave has an eastern niche said to be the place where Jesus was born, which contains the Altar of Nativity. The exact spot where Jesus was born is marked beneath this altar by a 14-pointed silver star with the Latin inscription &quot;Hic De Virgine Maria Jesus Christus Natus Est-1717&quot; (&quot;Here Jesus Christ was born to the Virgin Mary-1717&quot;). It was installed by the Catholics in 1717, removed – allegedly by the Greeks – in 1847, and replaced by the Turkish government in 1853. The star is set into the marble floor and surrounded by 15 silver lamps representing the three Christian communities: six belong to the Greek Orthodox, four to the Catholics, and five to the Armenian Apostolic. The Altar of the Nativity is maintained by the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic churches. The significance of the 14 points on the star is to represent the three sets of 14 generations in the genealogy of Jesus Christ. First 14 from Abraham to David, then 14 from David to the Babylonian captivity, then 14 more to Jesus Christ. In the middle of the 14 pointed star is a circular hole, through which one can reach in to touch the stone that is said to be the original stone that Mary lay on when she gave birth to Jesus. On the apse above the altar was a 12th-century mosaic depicting the Nativity; the base of the mosiac read &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis&quot; (&quot;Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will&quot;). The mosaic was vandalized in 1873 by Greeks who rioted against the Franciscans. Fragments of the mosaic can still be seen on the apse but are covered over by an icon during liturgical celebrations by the Greeks and Armenians.

Catholics are in charge of a section of the grotto known as the &quot;Grotto of the Manger&quot;, marking the traditional site where Mary laid the newborn baby in the manger. The Altar of the Magi is located directly opposite from the manger site. The Franciscans are also in charge of a door, at the opposite end of the Altar of the Nativity, that opens to a passageway connecting the grotto with the underground chapels of Saint Catherine Church.

===Church of St. Catherine===
The adjoining Church of St. Catherine is a Catholic church dedicated to Catherine of Alexandria, built in a more modern Gothic Revival style. It has been further modernized according to the liturgical trends which followed Vatican II.

This is the church where the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem celebrates Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Certain customs in this Midnight Mass predate Vatican II, but must be maintained because the &quot;Status Quo&quot; was legally fixed by a firman (decree) in 1852 under the Ottoman Empire, which is still in force today.

The bas-relief of the Tree of Jesse is a sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj which was recently incorporated into the Church of St. Catherine as a gift of Pope Benedict XVI during his trip to the Holy Land in 2009. It represents an olive tree as the Tree of Jesse, displaying the genealogy of Jesus from Abraham through Joseph, as well as symbolism from the Old Testament. The upper portion is dominated by a crowned figure of Christ the King in an open-armed pose blessing the Earth. It is situated along the passage used by pilgrims making their way to the Grotto of the Nativity.

===Caves accessed from St. Catherine&#x27;s===
Several chapels are found in the caves accessed from St. Catherine&#x27;s, including the Chapel of Saint Joseph commemorating the angel&#x27;s appearance to Joseph, commanding him to flee to Egypt; the Chapel of the Innocents, commemorating the children killed by Herod; and the Chapel of Saint Jerome, in the underground cell where tradition holds he lived while translating the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate).

==Tombs==
===Traditional tombs of saints===
According to a tradition not sustained by history, the tombs of four Catholic saints are said to be located beneath the Church of the Nativity, in the caves accessible from the Church of St. Catherine:
* Jerome, whose remains are said to have been transferred to the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome
* Paula, a disciple and benefactor of Jerome
* Eustochium, the daughter of Paula
* Eusebius of Cremona, a disciple of Jerome. A different tradition holds that he is buried in Italy.

===Ancient burials===
A number of ancient trough-shaped tombs can be seen in the Catholic-owned caves adjacent to the Nativity Grotto and St Jerome&#x27;s Cave, some of them inside the Chapel of the Innocents; more tombs can be seen on the southern, Greek-Orthodox side of the Basilica of the Nativity, also presented as being those of the infants murdered by Herod.

According to researcher Haytham Dieck, rock-cut tombs and bone fragments in one restricted room of the church date from the 1st century AD. In another clandestine chamber, the Cave of the Holy Innocents, skulls and other bones from as many as 2,000 people (according to Dieck) are collected, but are clearly not infantile.

==Christmas in Bethlehem==
There are three different dates for the celebration of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in Bethlehem:
* December 24 and 25 for the Catholics (Latins), who use the General Roman Calendar (Gregorian);
* January 6 and 7 for the Greek Orthodox, together with the Syriac Orthodox, Ethiopian and Coptic Orthodox, who use the Julian calendar;
* January 18 and 19 for the Armenian Apostolic Church, which combines the celebration of the Nativity with that of the Baptism of Jesus into the Armenian Feast of Theophany on January 6, according to the early traditions of Eastern Christianity, but follows the rules of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem in its calculations (January 6 Julian style corresponds to January 19 Gregorian style).

===Latin and Protestant===
The Catholic Midnight Mass in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve is broadcast around the world. Festivities begin hours earlier when dignitaries welcome the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem at the entrance to the city, near Rachel&#x27;s Tomb. Accompanied by a parade of youth organizations, he then makes his way to Manger Square, where crowds are waiting. Finally, he enters the Catholic Church of Saint Catherine for Mass, after which he leads the way to the adjacent Church of the Nativity. The patriarch carries a figurine of the Baby Jesus and places it on the silver star in the Nativity Grotto under the basilica.

Protestants worship either at the Lutheran church or the Church of the Nativity. However, some Protestant congregations go to Beit Sahour, a village near Bethlehem.

===Greek Orthodox===
On the Orthodox Christmas Eve, 13 days later, many visitors and faithful again fill Manger Square, this time to watch processions and receptions for the religious leaders of the different Eastern Orthodox communities.

===Armenian===
Members of the Armenian community are the last ones to celebrate Christmas, on January 18 and 19, in their own section of the Nativity Church. The altars there are also used by the smaller denominations during their respective Christmas festivities.

<doc id="63639" wikidata="Q626" url="?curid=63639" title="Volga">
<text>The Volga (, ) is the longest river in Europe and the longest endorheic basin river in the world. Situated in Russia, it flows through Central Russia to Southern Russia and into the Caspian Sea. The Volga has a length of , and a catchment area of . It is also Europe&#x27;s largest river in terms of average discharge at delta – between and – and of drainage basin. It is widely regarded as the national river of Russia. The hypothetical old Russian state, the Rus&#x27; Khaganate, arose along the Volga . Historically, the river served as an important meeting place of various Eurasian civilizations.

The river flows in Russia through forests, forest steppes and steppes. Five of the ten largest cities of Russia, including the nation&#x27;s capital, Moscow, are located in the Volga&#x27;s drainage basin. Because the Volga drains into the Caspian Sea, which is an endorheic body of water, the Volga does not naturally connect to any of the world&#x27;s oceans.

Some of the largest reservoirs in the world are located along the Volga River. The river has a symbolic meaning in Russian culture – Russian literature and folklore often refer to it as Волга-матушка &quot;Volga-Matushka&quot; (Mother Volga).

==Name==

The Russian hydronym () derives from Proto-Slavic *&quot;vòlga&quot; &#x27;wetness, moisture&#x27;, which is preserved in many Slavic languages, () &#x27;moisture&#x27;, Bulgarian () &#x27;moisture&#x27;, Czech &#x27;dampness&#x27;, Serbo-Croatian: () &#x27;moisture&#x27;, Slovene &#x27;moisture&#x27;, Polish &#x27;moisture&#x27; and Macedonian () &#x27;moisture&#x27;, among others.

The Scythian name for the Volga was , literally meaning &#x27;wetness&#x27;. This is related to the Avestan name for a mythical stream, (), which means &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;moisture&quot;, and was derived from Proto-Indo-European &#x27; or &#x27;). This name can be compared to several Indo-Iranic terms, such as:

* Sogdian () &#x27;vein, blood vessel&#x27; (from Old Iranian ),
* Persian &#x27;vein,&#x27;
* Vedic Sanskrit () &#x27;dew, liquid, juice; mythical river&#x27;), which was also the name of a tributary of the Indus river.
The Scythian name survives in modern Moksha as ().

The Greek author Herodotus recorded two more ancient Iranic names of the Volga:
* (; ), which was derived from Scythian , meaning &quot;broad&quot;.
** The Huns&#x27; name of the Dnieper river, , was also derived from Scythian .
* (Ancient Greek: ; )

The Turkic peoples living along the river formerly referred to it as or &quot;Atil&quot;. In modern Turkic languages, the Volga is known as () in Tatar, () in Chuvash, in Bashkir, in Kazakh, and in Turkish. The Turkic names go back to the ancient Turkic form &quot;/&quot;, the origin and meaning of which are not clear. Perhaps this form has a connection with the hydronym &quot;Irtesh&quot;.

The Turkic peoples associated the Itil&#x27;s origin with the Kama. Thus, a left tributary to the Kama was named the  &#x27;White Itil&#x27; which unites with the  &#x27;Black Itil&#x27; at the modern city of Ufa. The name () is used in the Cherkess language.

In Asia the river was known by its other Turkic name &#x27;yellow water&#x27;, but the Oirats also used their own name, or &#x27;adaptation river&#x27;. Presently the Mari, another Uralic group, call the river (), meaning &#x27;way&#x27; in Tatar. Formerly, they called the river , a borrowing from Old East Slavic.

The Volga is the longest river in Europe, and its catchment area is almost entirely inside Russia, though the longest river in Russia is the Ob–Irtysh river system.
It belongs to the closed basin of the Caspian Sea, being the longest river to flow into a closed basin. The source of the Volga lies in the village of Volgoverkhov&#x27;e in Tver Oblast. Rising in the Valdai Hills above sea level northwest of Moscow and about southeast of Saint Petersburg, the Volga heads east past Lake Sterzh, Tver, Dubna, Rybinsk, Yaroslavl, Nizhny Novgorod, and Kazan. From there it turns south, flows past Ulyanovsk, Tolyatti, Samara, Saratov and Volgograd, and discharges into the Caspian Sea below Astrakhan at below sea level.

The Volga has many tributaries, most importantly the Kama, the Oka, the Vetluga, and the Sura. The Volga and its tributaries form the Volga river system, which flows through an area of about in the most heavily populated part of Russia. The Volga Delta has a length of about and includes as many as 500 channels and smaller rivers. The largest estuary in Europe, it is the only place in Russia where pelicans, flamingos, and lotuses may be found. The Volga freezes for most of its length for three months each year.

The Volga drains most of Western Russia. Its many large reservoirs provide irrigation and hydroelectric power. The Moscow Canal, the Volga–Don Canal, and the Volga–Baltic Waterway form navigable waterways connecting Moscow to the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. High levels of chemical pollution have adversely affected the river and its habitats.

The fertile river valley provides large quantities of wheat and other agricultural produce, and also has many mineral riches. A substantial petroleum industry centers on the Volga valley. Other resources include natural gas, salt, and potash. The Volga Delta and the Caspian Sea are fishing grounds.

===Human history===
The Volga–Oka region has been occupied for at least 9,000 years and supported a bone and antler industry for producing bone arrowheads, spearheads, lanceheads, daggers, hunters knives, and awls. The makers also used local quartz and imported flints.

During classical antiquity, the Volga formed the boundary between the territories of the Cimmerians in the Caucasian Steppe and the Scythians in the Caspian Steppe. After the Scythians migrated to the west and displaced the Cimmerians, the Volga became the boundary between the territories of the Scythians in the Pontic and Caspian Steppes and the Massagetae in the Caspian and Transcaspian steppes.

Between the 6th and the 8th centuries, the Alans settled in the Middle Volga region and in the steppes of Russia&#x27;s southern region in the Pontic–Caspian steppe.

The area around the Volga was inhabited by the Slavic tribes of Vyatichs and Buzhans, by Finno-Ugric, Scandinavian, Baltic, Hunnic and Turkic peoples (Tatars, Kipchaks) in the first millennium AD, replacing the Scythians. Furthermore, the river played a vital role in the commerce of the Byzantine people. The ancient scholar Ptolemy of Alexandria mentions the lower Volga in his &quot;Geography&quot; (Book 5, Chapter 8, 2nd Map of Asia). He calls it the &quot;Rha&quot;, which was the Scythian name for the river. Ptolemy believed the Don and the Volga shared the same upper branch, which flowed from the Hyperborean Mountains. Between 2nd and 5th centuries Baltic people were very widespread in today&#x27;s European Russia. Baltic people were widespread from Sozh River till today&#x27;s Moscow and covered much of today&#x27;s Central Russia and intermingled with the East Slavs. The Russian ethnicity in Western Russia and around the Volga river evolved to a very large extent, next to other tribes, out of the East Slavic tribe of the Buzhans and Vyatichis. The Vyatichis were originally concentrated on the Oka River. Furthermore, several localities in Russia are connected to the Slavic Buzhan tribe, like for example Sredniy Buzhan in the Orenburg Oblast, Buzan and the Buzan River in the Astrakhan Oblast. Buzhan (; also known as &quot;Būzān&quot;) is also a village in Nishapur, Iran. In late 8th century the Russian state Russkiy Kaganate is recorded in different Northern and Oriental sources. The Volga was one of the main rivers of the Rus&#x27; Khaganates culture.

Subsequently, the river basin played an important role in the movements of peoples from Asia to Europe. A powerful polity of Volga Bulgaria once flourished where the Kama joins the Volga, while Khazaria controlled the lower stretches of the river. Such Volga cities as Atil, Saqsin, or Sarai were among the largest in the medieval world. The river served as an important trade route connecting Scandinavia, Finnic areas with the various Slavic tribes and Turkic, Germanic, Finnic and other people in Old Rus&#x27;, and Volga Bulgaria with Khazaria, Persia and the Arab world.
Khazars were replaced by Kipchaks, Kimeks and Mongols, who founded the Golden Horde in the lower reaches of the Volga. Later their empire divided into the Khanate of Kazan and Khanate of Astrakhan, both of which were conquered by the Russians in the course of the 16th century Russo-Kazan Wars. The Russian people&#x27;s deep feeling for the Volga echoes in national culture and literature, starting from the 12th century Lay of Igor&#x27;s Campaign. The Volga Boatman&#x27;s Song is one of many songs devoted to the national river of Russia.

Construction of Soviet Union-era dams often involved enforced resettlement of huge numbers of people, as well as destruction of their historical heritage. For instance, the town of Mologa was flooded for the purpose of constructing the Rybinsk Reservoir (then the largest artificial lake in the world). The construction of the Uglich Reservoir caused the flooding of several monasteries with buildings dating from the 15th and 16th centuries. In such cases the ecological and cultural damage often outbalanced any economic advantage.

====20th-century conflicts====
During the Russian Civil War, both sides fielded warships on the Volga. In 1918, the Red Volga Flotilla participated in driving the Whites eastward, from the Middle Volga at Kazan to the Kama and eventually to Ufa on the Belaya.

During the Civil War, Joseph Stalin ordered the imprisonment of several military specialists on a barge in the Volga and the sinking of a floating prison in which the officers perished.

During World War II, the city on the big bend of the Volga, currently known as Volgograd, witnessed the Battle of Stalingrad, possibly the bloodiest battle in human history, in which the Soviet Union and the German forces were deadlocked in a stalemate battle for access to the river. The Volga was (and still is) a vital transport route between central Russia and the Caspian Sea, which provides access to the oil fields of the Absheron Peninsula. Hitler planned to use access to the oil fields of Azerbaijan to fuel future German conquests. Apart from that, whoever held both sides of the river could move forces across the river, to defeat the enemy&#x27;s fortifications beyond the river. By taking the river, Hitler&#x27;s Germany would have been able to move supplies, guns, and men into the northern part of Russia. At the same time, Germany could permanently deny this transport route by the Soviet Union, hampering its access to oil and to supplies via the Persian Corridor.

For this reason, many amphibious military assaults were brought about in an attempt to remove the other side from the banks of the river. In these battles, the Soviet Union was the main offensive side, while the German troops used a more defensive stance, though much of the fighting was close quarters combat, with no clear offensive or defensive side.

==Ethnic groups==

Many different ethnicities lived on the Volga river. Numerous were the Eastern Slavic Vyatchi tribes which took a decisive role in the development of modern Russians. Among the first recorded people along the upper Volga were also the Finnic Mari (Мари) and Merya (Мäрӹ) people. Where the Volga flows through the steppes the area was also inhabited by the Iranian people of the Sarmatians from 200 BC. Since ancient times, even before Rus&#x27; states developed, the Volga river was an important trade route where not only Slavic, Turkic and Finnic peoples lived, but also Arab world of the Middle East met the Varangian people of the Nordic countries through trading. In the 8th and 9th centuries colonization also began from Kievan Rus&#x27;. Slavs from Kievan Rus&#x27; brought Christianity to the upper Volga, and a portion of non-Slavic local people adopted Christianity and gradually became East Slavs. The remainder of the Mari people migrated to the east far inland. In the course of several centuries the Slavs assimilated the indigenous Finnic populations, such as the Merya and Meshchera peoples. The surviving peoples of Volga Finnic ethnicity include the Maris, Erzyas and Mokshas of the middle Volga. Also Khazar and Bulgar peoples inhabited the upper, middle and lower of the Volga River basin.

Apart from the Huns, the earliest Turkic tribes arrived in the 7th century and assimilated some Finno-Ugric and Indo-European population on the middle and lower Volga. The Turkic Christian Chuvash and Muslim Volga Tatars are descendants of the population of medieval Volga Bulgaria. Another Turkic group, the Nogais, formerly inhabited the lower Volga steppes.

The Volga region is home to a German minority group, the Volga Germans. Catherine the Great had issued a manifesto in 1763 inviting all foreigners to come and populate the region, offering them numerous incentives to do so. This was partly to develop the region but also to provide a buffer zone between the Russians and the Mongols to the east. Because of conditions in German territories, Germans responded in the largest numbers. Under the Soviet Union a slice of the region was turned into the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.

==Navigation==
The Volga, widened for navigation purposes with construction of huge dams during the years of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s industrialization, is of great importance to inland shipping and transport in Russia: all the dams in the river have been equipped with large (double) ship locks, so that vessels of considerable dimensions can travel from the Caspian Sea almost to the upstream end of the river.

Connections with the river Don and the Black Sea are possible through the Volga–Don Canal. Connections with the lakes of the North (Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega), Saint Petersburg and the Baltic Sea are possible through the Volga–Baltic Waterway; and commerce with Moscow has been realised by the Moscow Canal connecting the Volga and the Moskva River.

This infrastructure has been designed for vessels of a relatively large scale (lock dimensions of on the Volga, slightly smaller on some of the other rivers and canals) and it spans many thousands of kilometers. A number of formerly state-run, now mostly privatized, companies operate passenger and cargo vessels on the river; Volgotanker, with over 200 petroleum tankers, is one of them.

In the later Soviet era, up to the modern times, grain and oil have been among the largest cargo exports transported on the Volga.
 Until recently access to the Russian waterways was granted to foreign vessels on a very limited scale. The increasing contacts between the European Union and Russia have led to new policies with regard to the access to the Russian inland waterways.

<text>A partridge is a medium-sized galliform bird in any of several genera, with a wide native distribution throughout parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. Several species have been introduced to the Americas. They are sometimes grouped in the Perdicinae subfamily of the Phasianidae (pheasants, quail, etc.). However, molecular research suggests that partridges are not a distinct taxon within the family Phasianidae, but that some species are closer to the pheasants, while others are closer to the junglefowl.


==Description==
Partridges are medium-sized game birds, generally intermediate in size between the larger pheasants, smaller quail; they&#x27;re ground-dwelling birds that feature variable plumage colouration across species, with most tending to grey and brown.

==Range and habitat==
Partridges are native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Some species are found nesting on steppes or agricultural land, while other species prefer more forested areas. They nest on the ground and have a diet consisting of seeds and insects.

==Hunting==
Species such as the grey partridge and the red-legged partridge are popular as game birds, and are often reared in captivity and released for the purpose of hunting. For the same reason, they have been introduced into large areas of North America.


==Cultural references==
According to Greek legend, the first partridge appeared when Daedalus threw his apprentice, Talos, off the sacred hill of Athena in a fit of jealous rage. Supposedly mindful of his fall, the bird does not build its nest in the trees, nor take lofty flights and avoids high places.

As described by medieval scholar Madeleine Pelner Cosman, medical practitioners in the Middle Ages recommended partridge as a food of love: They suggested that &quot;Partridge was superior in arousing dulled passions and increasing the powers of engendering. Gentle to the human stomach, partridge stimulated bodily fluids, raised the spirits, and firmed the muscles.&quot;

Probably the most famous reference to the partridge is in the Christmas carol, &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;. The first gift listed is &quot;a partridge in a pear tree&quot;, and these words end each verse. Since partridges are unlikely to be seen in pear trees (they are ground-nesting birds) it has been suggested that the text &quot;a pear tree&quot; is a corruption of the French &quot;une perdrix&quot; (a partridge).

The partridge has also been used as a symbol that represents Kurdish nationalism. It is called &quot;Kew&quot;. Sherko Kurmanj discusses the paradox of symbols in Iraq as an attempt to make a distinction between the Kurds and the Arabs. He says that while Iraqis generally regards the palm tree, falcon, and sword as their national symbols, the Kurds consider the oak, partridge, and dagger as theirs.

<doc id="63656" wikidata="Q987231" url="?curid=63656" title="Quorn, Leicestershire">
<text>Quorn () is a village and civil parish in Leicestershire, England, near the university town of Loughborough. Its name was shortened from Quorndon in 1889, to avoid postal difficulties owing to its similarity to the name of another village, Quarndon, in neighbouring Derbyshire.

==History==
The first known evidence of the village is in the Lincoln Episcopal Registers for 1209–1235, as Quernendon. Other variations of the village name over the centuries include Querne, Quendon, Querendon, Quarendon, Qaryndon, Querinden, Querondon, and Quernedon.

The quarrying of stone in Quorn began at a very early age at Buddon Wood, on the edge of the parish. Granite millstones were quarried in the early Iron Age, and under the Romans stone was quarried for building in Leicester. Some of the larger millstones can still be seen in the area, however these days they are either used as garden ornaments, or worked into seats or slabs. The village&#x27;s name is thought to be derived from the Old English &quot;cweorndun&quot;, meaning &quot;hill (&quot;dun&quot;) where millstones (&quot;cweorn&quot;) are obtained&quot;.

Quorn Hall, off Meynell Road on the eastern edge of the village, was built for the Farnham family in about 1680. It became the home of renowned fox hunter Hugo Meynell in 1753. He established his pack of hounds there, where it continued under later masters until 1905, thus giving a name to the famous Quorn Hunt. Three Royal Navy ships have been named HMS &quot;Quorn&quot; after the hunt.

Throughout history, the village has suffered extensive flooding due to the shallow natural gradient of the River Soar. This was exacerbated in the late 18th century when locks and weirs were constructed as part of the Leicester Navigation (later the Grand Union) and the canalisation of the river.

The village is indirectly linked to the meat substitute Quorn, which began production in 1985.

==World Wars==

96 men from Quorn lost their lives in the two World Wars (77 in World War I and 19 in World War II). A cenotaph in Quorn&#x27;s Memorial Gardens honours these men.

Quorn Camp was established on the grounds of Quorn House during World War II. It was used as a PoW camp and was also host to a number of the United States Army 82nd Airborne Division&#x27;s 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment. These paratroopers were involved in liberating the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, in Normandy, France, on the morning of D-Day and included Pvt. John Marvin Steele who famously became caught on the town&#x27;s church spire. This incident is today commemorated with a dummy paratrooper and parachute attached to the church in Sainte-Mère-Église.

A number of American veterans come back to Quorn, particularly every tenth anniversary of the D-Day landings, to remember their time in Quorn and their comrades who did not return.

There is a plaque commemorating the lost US servicemen in Quorn&#x27;s Memorial Gardens, upon which a poppy wreath is placed each year on Remembrance Sunday. There is also an avenue of lime trees in Stafford Orchard (the village park) in remembrance of those American soldiers that died, together with a plaque.

==Today==
Quorn is built around the old A6 road which runs through the centre of the village. On 28 October 1991 a dual carriageway bypass opened taking the A6 away to the north-eastern edge of the village.

The village has a railway station called Quorn and Woodhouse, shared with the neighbouring hamlet of Woodhouse, which was on the national Great Central Railway network, with the section through Quorn preserved as the Great Central Railway (heritage railway). Numerous royal visitors have disembarked at the station to take part in the Quorn Hunt, including the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII). As well as being a site of historical and cultural interest throughout the year, the station hosts a fireworks display on the Bonfire weekend. The station is also home to a small vintage tea room at the &#x27;bridge-most&#x27; end of the platform, and the Butler Henderson Café in the main car park.

Sarson Street, running adjacent to Rawlins Community College, features many 19th-century terraced cottages, formerly those of framework knitters. Framework knitting was a major local industry until the onset of major mechanisation, and the cottages along this road display certain features typical of such an activity. Large windows for example were intended to allow in the necessary amount of light by which to work.

M. Wright &amp; Sons Ltd have been manufacturing fabrics at Quorn Mill, on Leicester Road, since 1870. Originally producing fabrics for the footwear and corset trades, the factory now produces high technology textiles for various industries including military, aerospace and leisure.

&quot;The Banks&quot; area of the village is an ornate paved area with seating, designed to resemble the letter &#x27;Q&#x27; when seen from the air.

The village prides itself on its green spaces, and more evidence of this can be seen with the opposition to proposed development at Caves field. This is a large cricket pitch with pavilion where Quorn Cricket Club play during the season, near the centre of Quorn, which was the focus of interest from a housing development company. Objection was widespread, not only at the prospect of losing the cricket field but also due to the threat to a neighbouring wetland ecosystem, considered valuable by environmentalists and the village population. The Farley Way Stadium is home to local association football club Quorn F.C. as well as Leicester City W.F.C.

In the past few years, efforts have been made to cater for the local young people. These have resulted in a half pipe being built next to the basketball court on Stafford Orchard, and a green shelter erected on the same site. In recent years the half pipe was removed and replaced by ready made ramps. Stafford Orchard is the large park, with a shaded area by the stream, youngster&#x27;s play area and half pipe now appeals to people of all ages. Examples of how the Stafford Orchard contributes to the village can be seen at the large and successful Mayday celebrations, as well as the local pub football matches occasionally held there.

In 2016, Quorn was named as one of the top five places in the UK to bring up a family in a survey conducted by estate agents, Leaders.

In 2024, Quorn village suffered extensive flooding after Storm Henk hits the UK.

== Notable buildings ==
The Church of St Bartholomew and Farnham Chapel is a Grade I listed building.

Quorn House, off Meeting Street, is a Grade II listed building, built in 1820, and was the seat of the Farnham family from c.1260 until 1993 when it was sold to fitness instructor Rosemary Conley, whose business occupied the building until 2015. Quorn House and the surrounding 120 acres of parkland was then purchased by Tarmac, operators of Mountsorrel Quarry, who have used the building as office space.

==Education==
St Bartholomew&#x27;s Primary School is a Church of England controlled school for foundation-age children through year 6.
In the centre of the village, adjacent to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, is Rawlins Academy, a secondary school which goes from years 7 to Sixth form where they got a good in the 2017 Ofsted report and outstanding in the Sixth form. The school also provides adult education and leisure classes. This is on the site of the Thomas Rawlins Grammar School for Girls.

Loughborough Grammar School have a number of sports pitches on the edge of the village.

==Population==
The 2011 census showed Quorn&#x27;s population to be 5,177 (an increase from 4,961 in 2001), composed of 2,524 males and 2,653 females.

==Parish and boundaries==
The full name, Quorndon, is still the official name of the civil parish.

The River Soar forms much of Quorn&#x27;s eastern boundary with the village of Barrow upon Soar and captures Pilling&#x27;s Lock and parts of the Grand Union Canal, Midland Main Line railway and A6 dual carriageway. The southern boundary, with the neighbouring villages of Mountsorrel, Rothley and Swithland, encompasses Buddon Wood, Mountsorrel Quarry and part of Swithland Reservoir. The Great Central Railway makes up most of western boundary with the village of Woodhouse. The northern boundary captures Bull in the Hollow Farm and is shared with the hamlet of Woodthorpe and the town of Loughborough.
