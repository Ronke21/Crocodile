<text>In mathematics, the free group &quot;F&quot;&quot;S&quot; over a given set &quot;S&quot; consists of all words that can be built from members of &quot;S&quot;, considering two words to be different unless their equality follows from the group axioms (e.g. &quot;st&quot; = &quot;suu&quot;−1&quot;t&quot; but &quot;s&quot; ≠ &quot;t&quot;−1 for &quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;,&quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;). The members of &quot;S&quot; are called generators of &quot;F&quot;&quot;S&quot;, and the number of generators is the rank of the free group.
An arbitrary group &quot;G&quot; is called free if it is isomorphic to &quot;F&quot;&quot;S&quot; for some subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, that is, if there is a subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;G&quot; such that every element of &quot;G&quot; can be written in exactly one way as a product of finitely many elements of &quot;S&quot; and their inverses (disregarding trivial variations such as &quot;st&quot; = &quot;suu&quot;−1&quot;t&quot;).

A related but different notion is a free abelian group; both notions are particular instances of a free object from universal algebra. As such, free groups are defined by their universal property.

== History ==
Free groups first arose in the study of hyperbolic geometry, as examples of Fuchsian groups (discrete groups acting by isometries on the hyperbolic plane). In an 1882 paper, Walther von Dyck pointed out that these groups have the simplest possible presentations. The algebraic study of free groups was initiated by Jakob Nielsen in 1924, who gave them their name and established many of their basic properties. Max Dehn realized the connection with topology, and obtained the first proof of the full Nielsen–Schreier theorem. Otto Schreier published an algebraic proof of this result in 1927, and Kurt Reidemeister included a comprehensive treatment of free groups in his 1932 book on combinatorial topology. Later on in the 1930s, Wilhelm Magnus discovered the connection between the lower central series of free groups and free Lie algebras.

== Examples ==
The group (Z,+) of integers is free of rank 1; a generating set is &quot;S&quot; = {1}. The integers are also a free abelian group, although all free groups of rank formula_1 are non-abelian. A free group on a two-element set &quot;S&quot; occurs in the proof of the Banach–Tarski paradox and is described there.

On the other hand, any nontrivial finite group cannot be free, since the elements of a free generating set of a free group have infinite order.

In algebraic topology, the fundamental group of a bouquet of &quot;k&quot; circles (a set of &quot;k&quot; loops having only one point in common) is the free group on a set of &quot;k&quot; elements.

== Construction ==
The free group &quot;FS&quot; with free generating set &quot;S&quot; can be constructed as follows. &quot;S&quot; is a set of symbols, and we suppose for every &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot; there is a corresponding &quot;inverse&quot; symbol, &quot;s&quot;−1, in a set &quot;S&quot;−1. Let &quot;T&quot; = &quot;S&quot; ∪ &quot;S&quot;−1, and define a word in &quot;S&quot; to be any written product of elements of &quot;T&quot;. That is, a word in &quot;S&quot; is an element of the monoid generated by &quot;T&quot;. The empty word is the word with no symbols at all. For example, if &quot;S&quot; = {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}, then &quot;T&quot; = {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;−1, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;−1, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;c&quot;−1}, and
:formula_2
is a word in &quot;S&quot;.

If an element of &quot;S&quot; lies immediately next to its inverse, the word may be simplified by omitting the c, c−1 pair:
:formula_3
A word that cannot be simplified further is called reduced.

The free group &quot;FS&quot; is defined to be the group of all reduced words in &quot;S&quot;, with concatenation of words (followed by reduction if necessary) as group operation. The identity is the empty word.

A reduced word is called cyclically reduced if its first and last letter are not inverse to each other. Every word is conjugate to a cyclically reduced word, and a cyclically reduced conjugate of a cyclically reduced word is a cyclic permutation of the letters in the word. For instance &quot;b&quot;−1&quot;abcb&quot; is not cyclically reduced, but is conjugate to &quot;abc&quot;, which is cyclically reduced. The only cyclically reduced conjugates of &quot;abc&quot; are &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;bca&quot;, and &quot;cab&quot;.

== Universal property ==
The free group &quot;FS&quot; is the universal group generated by the set &quot;S&quot;. This can be formalized by the following universal property: given any function from &quot;S&quot; to a group &quot;G&quot;, there exists a unique homomorphism &quot;φ&quot;: &quot;FS&quot; → &quot;G&quot; making the following diagram commute (where the unnamed mapping denotes the inclusion from &quot;S&quot; into &quot;FS&quot;):

That is, homomorphisms &quot;FS&quot; → &quot;G&quot; are in one-to-one correspondence with functions &quot;S&quot; → &quot;G&quot;. For a non-free group, the presence of relations would restrict the possible images of the generators under a homomorphism.

To see how this relates to the constructive definition, think of the mapping from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;FS&quot; as sending each symbol to a word consisting of that symbol. To construct &quot;φ&quot; for the given , first note that &quot;φ&quot; sends the empty word to the identity of &quot;G&quot; and it has to agree with on the elements of &quot;S&quot;. For the remaining words (consisting of more than one symbol), &quot;φ&quot; can be uniquely extended, since it is a homomorphism, i.e., &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;ab&quot;) = &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).

The above property characterizes free groups up to isomorphism, and is sometimes used as an alternative definition. It is known as the universal property of free groups, and the generating set &quot;S&quot; is called a basis for &quot;FS&quot;. The basis for a free group is not uniquely determined.

Being characterized by a universal property is the standard feature of free objects in universal algebra. In the language of category theory, the construction of the free group (similar to most constructions of free objects) is a functor from the category of sets to the category of groups. This functor is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from groups to sets.

==Facts and theorems==
Some properties of free groups follow readily from the definition:

#Any group &quot;G&quot; is the homomorphic image of some free group &quot;FS&quot;. Let &quot;S&quot; be a set of &quot;generators&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. The natural map &quot;φ&quot;: &quot;FS&quot; → &quot;G&quot; is an epimorphism, which proves the claim. Equivalently, &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to a quotient group of some free group &quot;FS&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; can be chosen to be finite here, then &quot;G&quot; is called finitely generated. The kernel Ker(&quot;φ)&quot; is the set of all &quot;relations&quot; in the presentation of &quot;G&quot;; if Ker(&quot;φ)&quot; can be generated by the conjugates of finitely many elements of &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is finitely presented.
#If &quot;S&quot; has more than one element, then &quot;FS&quot; is not abelian, and in fact the center of &quot;FS&quot; is trivial (that is, consists only of the identity element).
#Two free groups &quot;FS&quot; and &quot;FT&quot; are isomorphic if and only if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; have the same cardinality. This cardinality is called the rank of the free group &quot;F&quot;. Thus for every cardinal number &quot;k&quot;, there is, up to isomorphism, exactly one free group of rank &quot;k&quot;.
#A free group of finite rank &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 has an exponential growth rate of order 2&quot;n&quot; − 1.

A few other related results are:
#The Nielsen–Schreier theorem: Every subgroup of a free group is free. Furthermore, if the free group &quot;F&quot; has rank &quot;n&quot; and the subgroup &quot;H&quot; has index &quot;e&quot; in &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;H&quot; is free of rank 1 + &quot;e&quot;(&quot;n–&quot;1).
#A free group of rank &quot;k&quot; clearly has subgroups of every rank less than &quot;k&quot;. Less obviously, a (&quot;nonabelian!&quot;) free group of rank at least 2 has subgroups of all countable ranks.
#The commutator subgroup of a free group of rank &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1 has infinite rank; for example for F(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;), it is freely generated by the commutators [&quot;a&quot;&quot;m&quot;, &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;] for non-zero &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.
#The free group in two elements is SQ universal; the above follows as any SQ universal group has subgroups of all countable ranks.
#Any group that acts on a tree, freely and preserving the orientation, is a free group of countable rank (given by 1 plus the Euler characteristic of the quotient graph).
#The Cayley graph of a free group of finite rank, with respect to a free generating set, is a tree on which the group acts freely, preserving the orientation. As a topological space (a one-dimensional simplicial complex), this Cayley graph Γ(&quot;F&quot;) is contractible. For a finitely presented group &quot;G,&quot; the natural homomorphism defined above, &quot;φ&quot; : &quot;F&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, defines a covering map of Cayley graphs &quot;φ*&quot; : Γ(&quot;F&quot;) → Γ(&quot;G&quot;), in fact a universal covering. Hence, the fundamental group of the Cayley graph Γ(&quot;G&quot;) is isomorphic to the kernel of &quot;φ&quot;, the normal subgroup of relations among the generators of &quot;G&quot;. The extreme case is when &quot;G&quot; = {&quot;e&quot;}, the trivial group, considered with as many generators as &quot;F&quot;, all of them trivial; the Cayley graph Γ(&quot;G&quot;) is a bouquet of circles, and its fundamental group is &quot;F&quot; itself.
#Any subgroup of a free group, formula_4, corresponds to a covering space of the bouquet of circles, namely to the Schreier coset graph of &quot;F&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. This can be used to give a topological proof of the Nielsen-Schreier theorem above.
#The groupoid approach to these results, given in the work by P.J. Higgins below, is related to the use of covering spaces above. It allows more powerful results, for example on Grushko&#x27;s theorem, and a normal form for the fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups. In this approach there is considerable use of free groupoids on a directed graph.
# Grushko&#x27;s theorem has the consequence that if a subset &quot;B&quot; of a free group &quot;F&quot; on &quot;n&quot; elements generates &quot;F&quot; and has &quot;n&quot; elements, then &quot;B&quot; generates &quot;F&quot; freely.

== Free abelian group ==
The free abelian group on a set &quot;S&quot; is defined via its universal property in the analogous way, with obvious modifications:
Consider a pair (&quot;F&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;), where &quot;F&quot; is an abelian group and &quot;φ&quot;: &quot;S&quot; → &quot;F&quot; is a function. &quot;F&quot; is said to be the free abelian group on &quot;S&quot; with respect to &quot;φ&quot; if for any abelian group &quot;G&quot; and any function &quot;ψ&quot;: &quot;S&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, there exists a unique homomorphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;F&quot; → &quot;G&quot; such that

:&quot;f&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;)) = &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), for all &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;.

The free abelian group on &quot;S&quot; can be explicitly identified as the free group F(&quot;S&quot;) modulo the subgroup generated by its commutators, [F(&quot;S&quot;), F(&quot;S&quot;)], i.e.
its abelianisation. In other words, the free abelian group on &quot;S&quot; is the set of words that are distinguished only up to the order of letters. The rank of a free group can therefore also be defined as the rank of its abelianisation as a free abelian group.

==Tarski&#x27;s problems==
Around 1945, Alfred Tarski asked whether the free groups on two or more generators have the same first-order theory, and whether this theory is decidable. answered the first question by showing that any two nonabelian free groups have the same first-order theory, and answered both questions, showing that this theory is decidable.

A similar unsolved (as of 2011) question in free probability theory asks whether the von Neumann group algebras of any two non-abelian finitely generated free groups are isomorphic.

<text>Chania (, , ), also sometimes romanized as Hania, is a city in Greece and the capital of the Chania regional unit. It lies along the north west coast of the island Crete, about west of Rethymno and west of Heraklion.

The municipality has 111,375 inhabitants (2021). This consists of the city of Chania and several nearby areas, including Kounoupidiana, Mournies, Souda, Nerokouros, Daratsos, Perivolia, Galatas and Aroni.

==History==

===Minoan era===

Chania was the site of a Minoan settlement, known from Linear B tablets from Knossos as having been named (). The subsequent Greek settlement was likewise known as Cydonia (, &quot;Kydōnía&quot;), ultimately the source of the English word &quot;quince&quot;. 

Some notable archaeological evidence for the existence of this Minoan city below some parts of today&#x27;s Chania was found by excavations in the district of Kasteli in the Old Town. This area appears to have been inhabited since the Neolithic Age.

===Ancient Greek and Roman eras===

Cydonia reemerged after the end of the Minoan period as an important city-state in Classical Greece, one whose domain extended from Chania Bay to the feet of the White Mountains. The first major wave of settlers from mainland Greece was by the Dorians who came around Cydonia was constantly at war with other Cretan city-states such as Aptera, Phalasarna, and Polyrrinia and was important enough for the Cydonians to be mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In the Roman consul Q. Caecilius Metellus defeated the Cretans and conquered Cydonia, to which he granted the privileges of an independent city-state.

===Byzantine and Arab eras===

Cydonia was not well documented in late antiquity or in the early medieval period, when it was first ruled by the Byzantine Empire (395–824) and then by the Emirate of Crete (824–961). The Arabs seem to have begun calling the settlement (), literally &quot;the Caravanserai&quot; or &quot;Inn&quot; but possibly transcribing the name of a neighborhood previously devoted to the worship of the Minoan god Welchanos. The city had become known as Chania in Greek by the time of the second period of Byzantine rule (961–1204). In order to deter another Arab invasion, the Byzantines strongly fortified the city, reusing materials from ancient buildings in the area. Chania was the seat of a Byzantine bishopric, which became the Roman Catholic Diocese of La Canea under Venetian rule and then the Latin titular see of Cydonia.

===Venetian era===

After the fall of Constantinople during the 1204 Fourth Crusade, Crete was distributed to Bonifacio, Marquess of Montferrat. He in turn chose to sell it to the Venetians for 100 silver marks. In 1252, the Venetians managed to subdue the Cretans but in 1263, their rivals of Genoa, with local support, seized the city under the leadership of Enrico Pescatore, count of Malta, and held it until 1285, when the Venetians returned. Under the Venetian name La Canea, the city was chosen to be the seat of the Rector (Administrator General) of the region and flourished as a significant commercial centre of a fertile agricultural region.

The Venetian rule was initially strict and oppressive but slowly the relations between the two parts improved. Contact with Venice led to close intertwining of Cretan and Venetian cultures, without, however, the Cretans losing their Greek Orthodox nature. Its fortifications were strengthened, giving Chania the form that it still has today. On the other hand, after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, many priests, monks and artists took refuge in Crete and reinforced the Byzantine religion and culture on the island. The city of Canea during the period that followed was a blend of Byzantine, Venetian, and Classical Greek cultural elements. Many of the important buildings of the town were built during this era and the intellectual activities (written word, music, education) were also promoted.

===Ottoman era===

During the opening months of the Cretan War (1645–1669) the city&#x27;s walls did not prevent an Ottoman army from capturing it from the Venetians after a two-month siege. Many Cretans fled to escape persecution, many others were slaughtered or converted to Islam, while numerous Turkish Muslim settlers arrived changing the ethnic mix of the city. 

Under the Ottoman Turkish name Hanya (), Muslims resided mainly in the eastern quarters, Kastelli and Splantzia, where they converted the Dominican church of St Nicholas into the central Sovereign&#x27;s Mosque (Turkish: &quot;Hünkar Camısı&quot;). They also built new mosques such as the Küçük Hasan Pasha Mosque or Yali Mosque on the harbour. Public baths (hamam), and fountains were a feature of the Ottoman city. The pasha of Crete resided in Hanya.

The city remained under Ottoman control despite fighting during the Greek War of Independence (1821-29), the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869) and the Cretan Revolt (1878). Due to the island&#x27;s mixture of Muslim and Christian residents, Crete was the subject of international debate between the European great powers, most notably at the Treaty of Berlin (1878) which resulted in the Pact of Halepa. During the 19th and early 20th century, interethnic violence on Crete eventually led to the mass migration of the island&#x27;s local Muslim population to other Mediterranean islands or coastal cities. Mass conversions also occurred. The population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1922 resulted in the deportation of the island&#x27;s last Muslim residents.

===Modern era===

In 1898, during the final moves towards independence and &quot;enosis&quot;—union with Greece—the Great Powers made Chania the capital of the semi-autonomous Cretan State (), with Prince George of Greece, the High Commissioner of Crete living here. During these years Crete issued its own stamps and money. This was a very important transitional period when, no longer an isolated &quot;vilayet&quot; of the Ottoman Empire, the city became more cosmopolitan and flourishing, regaining its role as the crossroad of civilizations, influenced by Europe as well as by the East. Many important buildings were built during this era, intellectual and artistic societies were created and a new class of local aristocracy brought a different atmosphere to the everyday life of the town. The district of Halepa has many fine neoclassical embassies and consulates dating from this period.

However the main goal was &quot;enosis&quot; with Greece, which came after Eleftherios Venizelos&#x27;s constant opposition to Prince George&#x27;s rule over Crete. The series of conflicts includes the Therisos revolt in 1905, which overthrew Prince George and brought Alexandros Zaimis to rule Crete. Finally, in 1908, Venizelos managed to establish a revolutionary government, recognized by the Great Powers. His later election as the prime minister of Greece (1910) eventually led to Crete&#x27;s union with Greece on 1 December 1913, following the Balkan Wars. The Greek flag was raised for the first time at Fort Firka in the Old Harbour in the presence of Venizelos and King Constantine.

Due to the popularity of Venizelos, Chania as with most of Crete remained staunchly pro-Venizelist, pro-Liberal and later pro-Republican in the National Schism and the interwar period. The only attempt to overthrow the monarchist Metaxas Regime occurred in the city with the failed 28 July 1938 uprising.

===World War II===
Another important period for the city of Chania was the invasion and occupation by German forces during World War II. The British force that faced the German paratroopers during the Battle Of Crete in 1941, had artillery elements over the hill of Dexameni in the south of the city. These elements bombarded the German forces in the Maleme airfield undetected, until they ran out of ammunition. George II of Greece stayed in a villa near the village of Perivolia outside Chania before escaping to Egypt. Part of the city was bombed and a significant proportion of the area&#x27;s population was either executed or imprisoned due to participation in the resistance against the German rule. The Jewish community of Chania was also eliminated during the German occupation. Most of them were transported off the island by the Nazi occupiers in 1944. A British torpedo sank the ship &quot;Tanais&quot;, which was carrying most of the Jewish prisoners.

===Postwar era===

The city of Chania slowly regained its normal pace of development during the 1950s, trying to overcome the difficulties that the war had left in its aftermath. During the 1970s, Crete became a major tourist destination for Greek and international tourists, something that gave a significant boost to the city&#x27;s economy and affected the everyday life and the overall culture of the locals. The capital of Crete was moved to Heraklion in 1971. 

Since the 1990s, the city of Chania has entered a new era, mainly due to construction and infrastructure such as a new airport, port and educational facilities, and it is considered a prominent tourist resort in the Mediterranean Sea.

==Geography==
The city of Chania lies around from the west end of Crete. By road, the distance is approximately .

===Cityscape===
The city of Chania can be divided into two parts: the old town and the modern city which is the larger one. The old town is situated next to the old harbour and is the matrix around which the whole urban area was developed. It used to be surrounded by the old Venetian fortifications that started to be built in 1538. Of them, only the eastern and western parts have survived. From the south, the old town is continuous with the new, and from the north the physical border is the sea. The centre of the modern city is the area extending next to the old town and especially towards the south.

==== The old town ====

The borders of the Old Town are the partly destroyed old Venetian wall (and bulwarks) and this has been the cradle of all the civilizations which were developed in the area. The central part of the old town is named Kasteli and has been inhabited since Neolithic times (ancient Kydonia). It is located on a small hill right next to the seafront and has always been the ideal place for a settlement due to its secure position, its location next to the harbour and its proximity to the fertile valley in the south. Nowadays it is a bit more quiet than the neighbouring areas of the west part of the district. The Splantzia quarter (next to the east part of Kasteli) is also largely untouched.

The main square of the Old Town (next to the west end of Kasteli) is Eleftherios Venizelos Square, also known as &quot;Syntrivani&quot; (from Turkish &quot;şadırvan&quot; &#x27;fountain&#x27;). It is the heart of the tourist activities in the area. Next to this (on the west side) lies the Topanas district, which was the Christian quarter during the Ottoman period. Its name comes from the Venetian ammunition warehouse (Turkish &quot;tophane&quot;), which was located there. The Jewish quarter (&quot;Evraiki&quot; or &quot;Ovraiki&quot;) was located at the north-west of the Old Town, behind the harbour and within the borders of Topanas. The Topanas area has many narrow alleys and old buildings, some of which have been restored as hotels, restaurants, shops and bars. This makes it a popular place especially during the warm period (April–October). In the winter, it still remains a centre of activities (especially for nightlife).

Finally, a very distinctive area of the Old Town is the harbour itself and generally the seafront. Akti Tompazi, Akti Kountouriotou and Akti Enoseos (marina) all feature several historical buildings and nightlife. The main street that combines the modern town with the old town is Halidon Street.

==== The modern city ====
The modern part of Chania is where most locals live and work. It is less traditional than the old town, but there are still areas of some historical interest. 

The oldest district (early 18th century) of the modern city is Nea Hora (meaning &quot;New Town&quot;) which is located beyond the west end of the old town. It is a developing area with narrow old lanes leading to a small fishing harbour. 

The district of Koum Kapi (the Venetians had first named it &quot;Sabbionara&quot;, which means &quot;the Gate of the Sand&quot;, the same as &quot;Koum Kapi&quot;) situated beyond the walls at the eastern part of the old town, was also one of the first places to be inhabited outside the fortification walls. Initially, it was home for the &quot;Halikoutes&quot;, a group of Bedouins from North Africa who had settled there in the last years of Ottoman rule. Nowadays it is a developing area with many cafes, bars and restaurants on its beach. 

In the same era the district of Halepa began to grow to the east of the city and used to be home for the local aristocracy. Some of the historical buildings of the area (including old embassies of foreign countries) had been destroyed or abandoned during the later decades of the 20th century, and it was only recently when some interest was shown for the restoration of the remaining ones.

Other historical buildings in the area include Eleftherios Venizelos&#x27;s House (built 1876-1880), the old French school (now property of the Technical University of Crete, housing the Department of Architecture), the Church of Agia Magdalini (built 1901-1903), The &quot;Palace&quot; (built 1882, house of Prince George during the period of the Cretan independence) and The Church of Evangelistria (built 1908–1923). Part of the marine area of Halepa is called Tabakaria, where a unique architectural complex of old leather processing houses is situated.

Apart from the previously mentioned older districts of the modern part of the town, several new residential areas have been developed during the 20th century, like Agios Ioannis, Koumbes, Lentariana, Pachiana and Pasakaki. Sections of the city centre are dominated by colourless medium-height block buildings, typical of the urbanization period of Greece (1950–1970). However, there are still some neoclassical houses, especially in the eastern part of Chania. There are some parks and several sports grounds, the most important being the Venizeleio Stadium of Chania and the Swimming Pool at Nea Hora. The 1913 indoor market (&quot;Agora&quot;), is on the edge of the old town and is popular with tourists and locals alike. Some other important sites of the newer urban area are The Court House (&quot;Dikastiria&quot;, built late in the 19th century), the Public Gardens (&quot;Kipos&quot;, created in 1870), the Garden Clock-Tower (&quot;Roloi&quot;, built in 1924–1927), the Episcopal Residence (Bishop&#x27;s residence, &quot;Despotiko&quot;, built in the early 19th century) and the House of Manousos Koundouros (built in 1909), the Cultural Centre (&quot;Pnevmatiko Kentro&quot;). The central largest squares in Chania are the Market Square (&quot;Agora&quot;), the Court House Square (&quot;Dikastiria&quot;) and the &quot;1866 Square&quot;.

Since the 1990s, there has been a profound movement of Chania residents towards the suburbs, as well as towards areas around the city which used to be rural, mainly around Kounoupidiana in the Akrotiri Peninsula.


===Climate===
The city has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with sunny dry summers and mild rainy winters. During the period between April and October, clear-sky weather is almost an everyday feature. The atmosphere is always warm, but strong heat waves (temperatures above 38 °C) are not very common, since the prevailing etesian winds (&quot;Meltemia&quot;) blow from the Aegean Sea and pleasantly moderate the conditions. Intervals of sunny days are frequent during the windy and rainy winter as well. Snow and frost are rare near the coast, with very few exceptions, like the snowstorm on 13 February 2004, when of snow accumulated in the greater regional area, causing general chaos. The last significant snowfall occurred on 8 January 2017 when the whole city and the old harbor were covered by snow. However, such cold days can be followed by much warmer and sunny weather. Heat waves can occur from as early as March, oftentimes accompanied by Saharan dust, whose main feature are the hot katabatic winds (foehn winds) blowing from the south, also called Sirocco (Σιρόκος) or &quot;Livas&quot; (the wind from Libya) by the Greeks.

The adjacent climate chart is based on data recorded during 1958–1997. The absolute maximum temperature recorded during this period was , while the absolute minimum recorded was . 

However, the record minimum was broken on 13 February 2004 when the temperature dropped to in the nearby airport of Souda and the record maximum was broken on 1 July 2021 when the temperature reached in the city station operated by the National Observatory of Athens.

The climate in Chania is further complemented due to the terrain and can vary throughout its regions and elevations and according to its topography. At the south lies the mountain range of Lefka Ori. Furthermore, prevailing winds, such as those of the West side and South of Crete, in addition to the North side—all interact to form its climate.

== Government ==
The municipality of Chania was formed in the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following seven former municipalities, that became municipal units:

* Akrotiri
* Chania
* Eleftherios Venizelos
* Keramia
* Nea Kydonia
* Souda
* Theriso

The municipality has an area of , the municipal unit . The municipality forms the eastern shore of Chania Bay (Kolpos Chanion Κόλπος Χανίων) and is bordered by Platanias (6) to the west, Sfakia (7) to the south and Apokoronas (2) to the east.

==Culture==


There are several museums, art galleries, theatre and music groups, educational and research institutions within the city.

The most important museums in Chania are:

* Chania&#x27;s new Archaeological Museum at 15 Skra Str. Chalepa, Chania, replaces the former Archeological Museum of Chania. The museum houses findings from different parts of the region and from several historical and prehistorical periods.
* Folklore Museum (Old Town)
* Historical Archive (the second most important in Greece)
* Nautical Museum of Crete (Old Town)
* Municipal Art Gallery
* Byzantine/Post-Byzantine Collection (Old Town)
* House of Eleftherios Venizelos
* Museum of Chemistry
* School life museum
* Museum of Typography, Chania

Several theatre groups are active in Chania with the most important being the Municipal and Regional Theatre of Crete (DI.PE.THE.K). The repertoire includes old and contemporary plays from Greek and foreign writers. The Venizelian Conservatory of Music (&quot;Odeion&quot;, established 1931) is also one of the most important cultural societies in Crete. A recent attempt from the municipality to create a chamber music group named &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; has been successful and its performances throughout the year have enriched the cultural event calendar of the city. A number of traditional [Cretan] musicians are also active in town.

There are five cinemas (two of them open-air), concentrating both in commercial and independent movies and occasionally organizing small festivals. 

There are numerous cafes, restaurants and bars throughout the Old Town and especially around the old Venetian harbour, at Enetiki Tafros (Venetian moat) and at Splantzia square, but also along the waterfront of the Koum Kapi and Nea Hora neighbourhoods. In summer, the bars and restaurants at Platanias and Agia Marina are also busy.

During the summer period, a variety of cultural events take place on a daily basis. Theatrical plays, concerts and several exhibitions from Greek and foreign artists are organized either by the municipality or by individuals. A venue which hosts many of these events is a theater located in the east bulwark of the Old Town (&quot;Anatoliki Tafros&quot;). Also, several festivals, conferences and sport events take place in Chania, especially between May and September.

A major role in the city&#x27;s cultural life is played by the Municipal Cultural Corporation of Chania (DI.P.E.X.) which organizes a significant part of the events taking place throughout the year.

There is a French, a German, an Italian and a Swedish consulate in Chania.

==Sports==
Water sports are very popular in Chania. The local water polo team, Nautical Club of Chania, N.O.X. has managed to be a protagonist in the primary league of the Greek national championship for years. Several athletes of this team have also played for Greece men&#x27;s national water polo team, which has achieved major international successes.

Football and basketball are also very popular in the town, however not as successful. The main football team is Chania FC (whose home ground is the Perivolia Municipal Stadium). Platanias FC (originally based at Maleme stadium near the town of Platanias) played in the top tier Greek Super League between 2012-2013 and 2017-2018. Platanias also played at Perivolia stadium during this period before returning to the smaller Maleme stadium after relegation.

The main clubs for athletics are &quot;Eleftherios Venizelos&quot; and &quot;Kydon&quot;. The &quot;Antisfairisi&quot; club is specialized in tennis, table tennis and also has a significant tradition in chess. Many of the above sports are being practiced in the old Stadium of Chania, built in 1935 with the financial support of Elena Venizelou, then wife of Eleftherios Venizelos. 

There is an open swimming pool for water sports in the suburb of Nea Chora. A new indoor pool, which was built on the nearby Akrotiri Peninsula in 2006, has not yet opened to the public because of the estimated operational costs. 

A modern indoor stadium for basketball, volleyball and other indoor sports and events, called Chania Kladissos Indoor Hall, was also built in 2005 near Nea Chora (Kladissos area).

There is a very active climbing and hiking club (Greek Mountaineering Club of Chania, E.O.S. Chanion) organizing weekly excursions of varying difficulty on the mountains of Crete and several other longer term missions in mainland Greece and abroad.

==Education and research==
Educational institutions located at the greater area of the city are:

* Technical University of Crete
* The Chania branch of the Technological Educational Institute of Crete
* The Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania
* The Merchant Marine Academy of Crete (AEN KRITIS)

Other research and intellectual institutes and societies in Chania are:

* The National Research Foundation &quot;Eleftherios K. Venizelos&quot;
* The Mediterranean Architecture Centre (KAM)
* The Institute of Olive Tree and Subtropical Plants of Chania
* The Institute of Cretan Law
* The Historical, Laographical and Archaeological Society of Crete
* Institute of Regional Press, Chania

Primary and secondary schools are mainly public in Chania (as in all cities in Greece). However, there has been a slow development of some private high schools recently. Among the &quot;Eniaia Lykeia&quot; (Unified Upper Secondary Schools) of the town there is an autonomous Ecclesiastical Lyceum in Agios Mattheos.

==Economy==

Two main sources of wealth in Chania are agriculture and tourism. A large portion of the city&#x27;s residents (not necessarily farmers) own many hectares of agricultural land where several plants are being cultivated, the most common ones being olive trees and citrus. Other important products include wine, avocados, dairy etc. The organization of the Agricultural August has been a recent attempt to promote local quality products including a series of activities organised by the Prefecture of Chania since 1999 has proved very successful.

On the other hand, starting from the early 1970s, tourism has developed rapidly. Nowadays the tertiary sector is becoming more and more important for the locals, since an increasing number of them are participating in the business.

An important centre of the economic activities in the town is the Chania Chamber of Commerce and Industry (E.B.E.X.).

Chania, has seen notable changes in its luxury residential market, reflecting its growing appeal to affluent tourists and expatriates. According to a recent report titled &quot;Chania Construction Market Trends for 2025-2028&quot; the annual change in luxury residential prices in 2024 for Chania has been significantly increased to 26% compared to 2021. This trend indicates a rising demand for high-end accommodations and properties, further boosting the tourism and real estate sectors.

==Health care==
The main hospital in the city is the General Hospital &quot;Agios Georgios&quot;. Other health institutions include the Crete Naval Hospital, the branch of the National Centre for Emergency Medical Care (E.K.A.B.), and the Clinic of Chronic Disease. The Chania branch of the Organisation Against Drugs (Ο.ΚΑ.ΝΑ.) opened in 2003.

The city has a number of private clinics (e.g., Iasis and Central Clinic of Chania), as well as medical centres specialising in various areas.

==Transport==
The city is served by Chania International Airport (IATA code: CHQ) 14 km from Chania on the Akrotiri Peninsula. The airport is named after Daskalogiannis, a Sfakiot hero who was skinned alive by the Ottomans in the 18th century.

Souda, some east of Chania, is the city&#x27;s port, with daily ferries to Piraeus. Souda also hosts Crete Naval Base, a major Greek and NATO base. Kissamos port, 41 km (25.5 mi) to the west of Chania, has ferry connections to Kythira Island and the Peloponnese region.

The A90 motorway runs along the north coast of Crete connecting Chania to Kissamos in the west and Heraklion and Sitia to the east. It is currently being upgraded to motorway standard and is expected to be completed by 2028.

<text>The Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) are rules prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) governing all aviation activities in the United States. The FARs comprise Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR). A wide variety of activities are regulated, such as aircraft design and maintenance, typical airline flights, pilot training activities, hot-air ballooning, lighter-than-air aircraft, human-made structure heights, obstruction lighting and marking, model rocket launches, commercial space operations, model aircraft operations, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and kite flying. The rules are designed to promote safe aviation, protecting pilots, flight attendants, passengers and the general public from unnecessary risk.

== FAR vs. 14 CFR ==
Since 1958, these rules have typically been referred to as &quot;FARs&quot;, short for Federal Aviation Regulations. However, another set of regulations (Title 48) is titled &quot;Federal Acquisition Regulations&quot;, and this has led to confusion with the use of the acronym &quot;FAR&quot;. Therefore, the FAA began to refer to specific regulations by the term &quot;14 CFR part XX&quot;.

FAA Order 1320.46C (Advisory Circular System) section 10 (Using references in the text of an AC) para. h explains &quot;&quot;Do not use the acronym &quot;FAR&quot; to refer to FAA&#x27;s regulations. Neither the Department of Transportation nor the Office of the Federal Register allow us to use &quot;FAR&quot; for our regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulations apply government-wide and are allowed to use the acronym &quot;FAR.&quot;&quot;&quot;

== 14 CFR overview ==
Title 14 CFR – Aeronautics and Space is one of the fifty titles that make up the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Title 14 is the principal set of rules and regulations (sometimes called administrative law) issued by the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration, federal agencies of the United States which oversee Aeronautics and Space. This title is available in digital and printed form, and can be referenced online using the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR).

== Content as of 2018 ==
The table of contents, as reflected in the e-CFR updated December 20, 2018:

== Organization ==
Each title of the CFR is organized into sections, called &quot;parts&quot;. Each part deals with a specific type of activity. For example, &quot;14 CFR Part 141&quot; contains rules for pilot training schools. The sections most relevant to aircraft pilots and AMTs (Aviation Maintenance Technicians) are listed below. Many of the FARs are designed to regulate certification of pilots, schools, or aircraft rather than the operation of airplanes. Once an airplane design is certified using some parts of these regulations, it is certified regardless of whether the regulations change in the future. For that reason, newer planes are certified using newer versions of the FARs, and in many aspects may be thus considered safer designs.

== Regulations of interest ==
The FARs have tens of thousands of separate sections, many used by large numbers of researchers on any given day. A few of the regulations particularly relevant to laypersons, to political issues, or of historical interest are listed here.

=== Part 1 ===
Many other FARs depend on definitions, which are found in Part 1.1

=== Part 21 ===
This part prescribes:
*(1) Procedural requirements for issuing and changing:
**(i) Design approvals;
**(ii) Production approvals;
**(iii) Airworthiness certificates;
**(iv) Airworthiness approvals;
*(2) Rules governing applicants for, and holders of, any approval or certificate specified above
*(3) Procedural requirements for the approval of articles.

=== Part 23 ===
Part 23 contains airworthiness standards required for issuance and change of type certificates for airplanes in these categories:

* nine or less passengers, 12,500 pounds or less MTOW
** normal: nonacrobatic operation (bank angle &lt; 60°)
** utility: limited acrobatic operation (60° &lt; bank angle &lt; 90°)
** acrobatic: no restrictions
* commuter category: multiengine airplanes, 19 or less passengers, 19,000 pounds or less MTOW, nonacrobatic operation (bank angle &lt; 60°)

In 2016 the FAA proposed a new system of performance-based airworthiness standards instead of prescriptive design requirements. The familiar weight and propulsion classifications of small airplane regulations would be replaced by performance and risk-based standards for aircraft weighing less than 19,000 pounds and seating 19 or fewer passengers. On August 30, 2017, a revised Part 23 ruling went into effect, changing the aircraft classifications. The new passenger classifications are: Level 1, seating for 0 to 1 passenger; Level 2, 2 to 6; Level 3, 7 to 9; Level 4, 10 to 19. Speed classifications are: low speed, Vc or Vmo equal to or less than 250 knots CAS and equal to or less than Mmo 0.6 Mach; high speed, Vc or Vmo greater than 250 knots CAS and Mmo greater than 0.6 Mach.

Prior to August 30, 2017, Part 23 had a large number of regulations to ensure airworthiness in areas such as structural loads, airframe, performance, stability, controllability, and safety mechanisms, how the seats must be constructed, oxygen and air pressurization systems, fire prevention, escape hatches, flight management procedures, flight control communications, emergency landing procedures, and other limitations, as well as testing of all the systems of the aircraft.

It also determined special aspects of aircraft performance such as stall speed (e.g., for single engine airplanes – not more than 61 knots), rate of climb (not less than 300 ft/min), take-off speed (not less than 1.2 x VS1), and weight of each pilot and passenger (170 lb for airplanes in the normal and commuter categories, and 190 lb for airplanes in the acrobatic and utility categories).

The Cessna 177, Cirrus SR20 and Piper PA-34 Seneca are well-known airplanes types that were certified to standards set out in FAR Part 23.

Most of the Federal Aviation Regulations, including Part 23, commenced on February 1, 1965. Prior to that date, airworthiness standards for airplanes in the normal, utility and acrobatic categories were promulgated in Part 3 of the US Civil Air Regulations. Many well-known types of light airplane, like the Cessna 150 and Piper Cherokee are certified to these older standards, even though they remained in production after 1965.

=== Part 25 ===

This part contains airworthiness standards for airplanes in the transport category. The Boeing 737 and later types, and Airbus A300 series, are well-known airplane types that were certified according to standards set out in FAR Part 25. Transport category airplanes are either:
* Jets with 10 or more seats or a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) greater than ; or
* Propeller-driven airplanes with greater than 19 seats or a MTOW greater than .

This Part is organized into six subparts, to specify design criteria for each of
* A – General
* B – Flight
* C – Structure
* D – Design and Construction
* E – Powerplant
* F – Equipment

For example, Part 25, Subpart D has section headings for
* General
* Control Surfaces
* Control Systems
* Landing Gear
* Floats and Hulls
* Personnel and Cargo Accommodations
* Emergency Provisions
* Ventilation and Heating
* Pressurization
* Fire Protection
* Miscellaneous

Most of the Federal Aviation Regulations, including Part 25, commenced on February 1, 1965. Prior to that date, airworthiness standards for airplanes in the transport category were promulgated in Part 4b of the US Civil Air Regulations which was in effect by November 1945. Effective August 27, 1957, Special Civil Air Regulation (SR) 422 was the basis for certification of the first turbine-powered transport airplanes, such as the Boeing 707, the Lockheed Electra, and the Fairchild 27. SR 422A became effective July 2, 1958, and was superseded by SR 422B, effective August 29, 1959. Only a few airplanes were certified under SR 422A, such as the Gulfstream I and the CL-44. First generation turbine-powered transport category airplanes such as the DC-8, DC-9, and B-727, were originally certified under SR 422B. SR 422B was recodified with minor changes to 14 CFR part 25, which became effective February 1965.

=== Part 27 ===
This part contains airworthiness standards for rotorcraft in the normal category. Rotorcraft up to 7,000 lb Maximum takeoff weight and 9 or fewer passengers are type certified in this part.

Examples of rotorcraft certified in this part are the Robinson R44, Schweizer 300 and the Bell 429.

=== Part 29 ===
This part contains airworthiness standards for rotorcraft in the transport category. Rotorcraft with more than maximum takeoff weight and 10 or more passengers are type certified in this part. Rotorcraft with more than maximum takeoff weight must be certified to additional Category A standards defined in this part.

=== Part 91 ===
Part 91 defines a Part 91 Operator. These are the regulations that define the operation of small non-commercial aircraft within the United States, however, many other countries defer to these rules. These rules set conditions, such as weather, under which the aircraft may operate.

==== Section 91.3(b) ====

This regulation states that the pilot-in-command is the party directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, an aircraft being operated.

Additionally, this regulation states that in an emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot-in-command may deviate from any regulation contained within Part 91 to the extent required to handle the emergency.

==== Temporary flight restrictions ====
The pertinent sections of the FAR (14 CFR Sections 91.137, 91.138, 91.139, 91.141, 91.143, 91.145, 99.7) describe temporary flight restrictions (TFR). A TFR is a geographically-limited, short-term, airspace restriction, typically in the United States. Temporary flight restrictions often encompass major sporting events, natural disaster areas, air shows, space launches, and Presidential movements. Before the September 11, 2001 attacks, most TFRs were in the interest of safety to flying aircraft with occasional small restrictions for Presidential movements. Since 9/11, TFRs have been routinely used to restrict airspace for 30 nautical miles around the President, with a radius no-fly zone for non-scheduled flights. They are also available to other high-profile figures such as presidential and vice-presidential candidates (though not all do so, as Senator John Kerry, who did not ask for any TFR during the 2004 election).

TFRs are deeply unpopular with pilots in the general aviation sector. Presidential TFRs are nearly 70 miles in diameter, and frequently close off not only the airport Air Force One is using but nearby airports as well. Others, including the Transportation Security Administration, argue that they are necessary for national security. TFRs can also be instituted for special military operations, such as with the 2023 Chinese balloon incident, where the FAA put into place one of the largest airspace restrictions in U.S. history, with an area approximately twice the size of Massachusetts and more than five times the restricted airspace surrounding Washington, D.C.

The responsibility for screening requests for TFR and for subsequent granting or denying them, lies with the FAA&#x27;s Office of System Operations Security.

==== Two-way radio communications failure ====

Section 91.185 of the Federal Aviation Restrictions deals with loss of radio communications while in flight.
If a loss of radio communications were to be encountered during VFR conditions, or if VFR conditions are encountered after loss of communication with the ground and other aircraft, the pilot of the aircraft shall continue the flight under VFR and land as soon as practicable.
If, however, the failure occurs in IFR conditions and/or the VFR conditions are not forthcoming, the pilot should continue under the following conditions:
:* Route – The pilot will follow:
::* The route assigned in the last contact with ATC before loss of communication, or, if being radar vectored, continue direct to the radar fix specified in the vector clearance;
::* In the absence of an assigned route, the pilot will follow the route advised by ATC;
::* In the absence of an ATC assigned or advised route, the pilot will follow the route set down in the flight plan.

:* Altitude – The pilot will continue at the highest of the following altitudes or flight levels:
::* The altitude assigned in the last contact with ATC before loss of communication;
::* The minimum altitude for IFR operations;
::* The altitude advised by ATC to be expected in a further clearance.

== Private, commuter, and commercial operations ==

For all pilots, there is an important distinction in the parts that address classes of flight. These parts do not distinguish type of aircraft, but rather type of activity done with the aircraft. Regulations for commuter and commercial aviation are far more intensive than those for general aviation, and specific training is required. Hence, flights are often referred to as &quot;Part XX operations&quot;, to specify which one of the different sets of rules applies in a particular case. Also, flight schools will often designate themselves as &quot;Part 61&quot; or &quot;Part 141&quot; to distinguish between different levels of training and different study programs they could offer to the students.

Part 61 is certification for all pilots, flight instructors, and ground instructors.

Part 63 is certification for flight crewmembers other than pilots; such as flight engineers and flight navigators.

Part 65 is certification for airmen other than flight crewmembers; such as Air Traffic Control Tower Operators, Aircraft Dispatchers, Mechanics, Repairmen and Parachute Riggers.

Part 91 is general operating rules for all aircraft. General aviation flights are conducted under this part. Part 91, Subpart (K) prescribes operating rules for fractional ownership programs.

Part 107 (FAA sUAS Part 107) specifies regulations to fly under the Small UAS Rule, or small unmanned aircraft systems in the National Airspace System (NAS). Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) are those that weigh less than 55 pounds.

Part 117 specifies flight and duty-time limitations and rest requirements for flightcrew members.

 defines regularly scheduled air carriers. These are airlines who operate scheduled flights carrying either cargo or more than nine passengers. Among the many Part 121 rules, pilots must have 1,500 of flight time and must retire by age 65.

Part 133 is external load (helicopter) operations.

 defines commuter and charter-type air carriers. These airlines can fly scheduled operations with aircraft with up to nine passengers (commuter flights), or they can fly on-demand, unscheduled air service for freight or with up to 30 passengers (charter flights). The Part 135 rules for pilots are less onerous, compared to Part 121: only 250 hours of flight time are required for a pilot to serve as first officer on a Part 135 flight and pilots are not subject to a mandatory retirement age. Additionally, Part 135 operators have lower TSA screening requirements for passengers. Part 135 operators may not sell individual seats on charter flights. Applicants for a Part 135 certificate must have exclusive use of at least one aircraft.

Part 141 is a more structured method for pilot training, based on FAA syllabus and other standards.

== Maintenance ==

Part 21 is certification procedures for products and parts.

Part 39 are airworthiness directives.

Part 43 is maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding, and alteration.

Part 145 contains the rules a certificated repair station must follow as well as any person who holds, or is required to hold, a repair station certificate issued under this part.

== Public charter operations ==

Part 380 governs public charter operators. These companies arrange flights on certified airlines (Part 121 or 135) but then sell individual seats on those flights directly to the public. Unlike the airlines they partner with, Part 380 operators don&#x27;t operate the aircraft themselves. Historically, this business model has been used by tour operators and casinos to offer occasional flights between smaller cities and popular leisure destinations. However, more recently, the Part 380 rules have also seen some creative applications.

In 2016, JSX began scheduling flights and selling tickets on flights operated by a Part 135 certificated airline (owned by the same parent company). This essentially allowed them to function as a scheduled air carrier (typically under Part 121 rules) while adhering to the less stringent Part 135 regulations. This enabled JSX to operate from fixed-base operator terminals, offering a more exclusive, private jet-like experience for their customers.

Other air carriers, including Advanced Air, Contour Airlines and Southern Airways Express, have also adopted similar strategies using Part 380. This approach allows them to offer more economical service to smaller cities participating in the Essential Air Service program, a government-backed initiative that subsidizes air service to under-served communities.

Several airlines and labor unions are opposed to these &quot;creative&quot; applications of Part 380, calling it a &quot;loophole&quot; that permits these companies to skirt the Part 121 rules others must follow. , the FAA is considering revisions to Part 380 regulations.

<doc id="59741" wikidata="Q160544" url="?curid=59741" title="Heraklion">
<text>Heraklion or Herakleion ( ; , , ), sometimes Iraklion, is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a municipal population of 179,302 (2021) and 211,370 in its wider metropolitan area, according to the 2011 census.
The greater area of Heraklion has been continuously inhabited since at least 7000 BCE, making it one of the oldest inhabited regions in Europe. It is also home to the ancient Knossos Palace, a major center of the Minoan civilization dating back to approximately 2000-1350 BCE, often considered Europe&#x27;s oldest city. The palace is one of the most significant archaeological sites in Greece, second only to the Parthenon in terms of visitor numbers.

Heraklion was Europe&#x27;s fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.

==Etymology==

The name Herakleion (Ηράκλειον) is derived from an ancient port of Heracleium that served as the harbour for Knossos. The port, bearing the same name, was named in honour of the hero Heracles (Hercules). In antiquity, it was located about 20 stadia (approximately 3.7 kilometers) from Knossos. Strabo also confirms the connection between the two.

The site of the ancient port falls within the boundaries of the modern city, near today’s port area. Although ecclesiastical records do not list it as a bishopric, a bishop named Theodoros of Heracleopolis is mentioned at the Second Council of Nicaea.

The name was revived in the 19th century and was in use by locals as early as 1867.

==Other Names==

1. &quot;In antiquity&quot;: The area that would later become the city of Heraklion served as the port for the ancient city of Knossos, one of the centers of the Minoan civilization. This strategic location facilitated trade and communication across the Mediterranean. Over time, as Knossos declined, the port area grew in significance, eventually becoming a prominent urban center.

2. &quot;Rabḍ al-ḫandaq&quot; (ربض الخندق): In 824 CE, Arab exiles from al-Andalus (Iberia) who conquered Crete and founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island&#x27;s capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called &quot;rabḍ al-ḫandaq&quot; (&quot;Castle of the Moat&quot;).

3. &quot;Chándax&quot; (Χάνδαξ) / &quot;Chándakas&quot; (Χάνδακας): The Arabic name &quot;rabḍ al-ḫandaq&quot; was Hellenized to Χάνδαξ (&quot;Chándax&quot;) or Χάνδακας (&quot;Chándakas&quot;).

4. &quot;Candia&quot;: This name, derived from &quot;Chándax,&quot; was Latinized as &quot;Candia&quot; and adopted into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as &quot;Candia&quot;, in Spanish as &quot;Candía&quot;, in French as &quot;Candie&quot;, and in English as &quot;Candy&quot;. These names could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name for the city was &quot;Kandiye&quot;.

5. &quot;Megalo Kastro&quot; (Μεγάλο Κάστρο): After the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as &quot;Megalo Kastro&quot; (, &#x27;Big Castle&#x27; in Greek) and its inhabitants were called &quot;Kastrinoi&quot; (Καστρινοί, &quot;castle-dwellers&quot;).

==History==
===Minoan era===

Heraklion is home to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, located in the southern periphery of the city and part of the Heraklion municipality. In Minoan times, Knossos was the largest centre of population on Crete and is considered by many to be the oldest city in Europe.

Knossos itself had a port at the site of Heraklion (in the modern area of Poros-Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of the Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC).

===Antiquity===

After the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area abounded with pirates and bandits.

===Emirate of Crete===

Heraklion was chosen as capital in 824, with fortifications starting being built the following year, by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city &quot;rabḍ al-ḫandaq&quot; (ربض الخندق, &quot;Castle of the Moat&quot;, hellenized as Χάνδαξ, &quot;Chandax&quot;). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (–961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.

===Byzantine era===
In 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.

===Venetian era===
In 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to thick, with seven bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed &quot;Candia&quot; and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as &quot;Regno di Candia&quot; (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, the Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of the Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the &quot;Cretan Renaissance&quot;.

===Ottoman era===

During the Cretan War (1645–1669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, the longest siege in history up until that time. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city&#x27;s Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669.
Under the Ottomans, &quot;Kandiye&quot; (Ottoman Turkish قنديه) was the capital of Crete (&quot;Girit Eyâleti&quot;) until 1849, when Chania (&quot;Hanya&quot;) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called &quot;Megalo Castro&quot; (Μεγάλο Κάστρο &#x27;Big Castle&#x27;).

During the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.

===Modern era===

An earthquake located off the northern coast of Crete on October 12, 1856, destroyed most of the over 3,600 homes in the city. Only 18 homes were left intact. The disaster claimed 538 victims in Heraklion.

In 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898–1908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time the ancient name of &quot;Heraklion&quot; was revived.

In 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion was severely damaged in the bombing campaign in May 1941 during the German invasion in the Battle of Crete. The city remained under German rule until 1945. Heraklion again became capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania. The city, and Crete generally, became a major tourist destination from the 1980s onwards.

==Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications==
The oldest monument of architecture is the palace in Knossos on the outskirts of the city.

Two largest medieval churches in the city were the Dominican church of St. Peter (built between 1248 and 1253) and the San Salvatore, belonging to the Augustinian Friars. The latter one stood in Kornaros Square, but was demolished in 1970.

Other monuments of architecture from Venetian times include the Saint Mark&#x27;s Basilica and the Renaissance loggia next to Lions Square (1626–28).

Around the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669. The Koules Fortress (&quot;Castello a Mare&quot;), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.

Many fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the &quot;Bembo&quot; fountain, the &quot;Priuli&quot; fountain, &quot;Palmeti&quot; fountain, &quot;Sagredo&quot; fountain and &quot;Morosini&quot; fountain in Lions Square (1628).

Architecture from the 19th century is represented by the St Titus Cathedral, built in 1869 as the Yeni Cami (&quot;New Mosque&quot;), and the Agios Minas Cathedral (1862–95).

An example of modern architecture in Heraklion is the Heraklion Archaeological Museum built between 1937 and 1940 by architect Patroklos Karantinos.

Several sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city&#x27;s and island&#x27;s history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.

==Municipality==

The municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:

*Gorgolainis
* Heraklion
*Nea Alikarnassos
*Paliani
*Temenos

The municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.

==Neighborhoods==

==Suburbs==

==Villages==

*Psari Forada

==Transportation==

===Port===

Heraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.

===Airport===
Heraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 59th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 8,066,000 passengers in 2022 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).

The airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.

===Highway network===
European route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.

===Public transit===

Urban buses serve the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connect Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.

===Railway===
From 1922 to 1937, a working industrial railway connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.

In the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants held in Heraklion, two engineers, George Nathenas and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno, and Heraklion. No official plans exist for implementing this idea.
==Climate==
Heraklion has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean Sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 °C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 5 °C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.8 °C in the airport while in the port it has never dropped below 0 °C. Snowfalls are rare with the last significant snowfall with a measurable amount on the ground occurring in February 2004. Heraklion falls in 11a hardiness zone.

<doc id="59742" wikidata="Q52636" url="?curid=59742" title="Menorca">
<text>Menorca or Minorca (from , later &quot;Minorica&quot;) is one of the Balearic Islands located in the Mediterranean Sea belonging to Spain. Its name derives from its size, contrasting it with nearby Mallorca. Its capital is Mahón (), situated on the island&#x27;s eastern end, although Menorca is not a province and forms a political union with the other islands in the archipelago. Ciutadella and Mahón are the main ports and largest towns. The port of Mahón is the second biggest natural port in the world.

Menorca had a population of 96,733 at the Census of 1 January 2021, which rose to an official estimated total of 99,005 at 1 January 2023. It is located 39°47&#x27; to 40°00&#x27;N, 3°52&#x27; to 4°24&#x27;E. Its highest point, called El Toro (from Catalan &quot;turó&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot;), roughly in the middle of the island, is above sea level.

== History ==

The island is known for its collection of megalithic stone monuments: &quot;navetes&quot;, &quot;taules&quot; and &quot;talaiots&quot;, which indicate very early prehistoric human activity. Some of the earliest culture on Menorca was influenced by other Mediterranean cultures, including the Greek Minoans of ancient Crete (see also Gymnesian Islands). For example, the use of inverted plastered timber columns at Knossos is thought to have influenced early peoples of Menorca in imitating this practice.

The end of the Punic wars saw an increase in piracy in the western Mediterranean. The Roman occupation of Hispania had meant a growth of maritime trade between the Iberian and Italian peninsulas. Pirates took advantage of the strategic location of the Balearic Islands to raid Roman commerce, using both Menorca and Mallorca as bases. In reaction to this, the Romans invaded Menorca. By 123 BC, both islands were fully under Roman control, later being incorporated into the province of Hispania Citerior.

In 13 BC Roman emperor Augustus reorganised the provincial system and the Balearic Islands became part of the Tarraconensis imperial province. The ancient town of Mago was transformed from a Carthaginian town to a Roman town.

=== Jews of Menorca ===

The island had a Jewish population. The &quot;Letter on the Conversion of the Jews&quot; by a fifth-century bishop named Severus tells of the forced conversion of the island&#x27;s 540 Jewish men and women in AD 418. Several Jews, including Theodore, a rich representative Jew who stood high in the estimation of his coreligionists and of Christians alike, underwent baptism. The act of conversion brought about, within a previously peaceful coexisting community, the expulsion of the ruling Jewish elite into the bleak hinterlands, the burning of synagogues, and the gradual reinstatement of certain Jewish families after the forced acceptance of Christianity, allowing the survival of those Jewish families who had not already perished. Many Jews secretly retained their Jewish faith while outwardly professing Christian beliefs. Some of these Jews form part of the Xueta community.

When Menorca became a British possession in 1713, they actively encouraged the immigration of foreign non-Catholics, which included Jews who were not accepted by the predominantly Christian inhabitants. When the Jewish community in Mahon requested the use of a room as a synagogue, their request was refused, and they were denounced by the clergy. In 1781, when Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon invaded Menorca, he ordered all Jews to leave in four days. At that time, the Jewish community consisted of about 500 people and they were transported from Menorca in four Spanish ships to the port of Marseille.

=== Middle Ages ===

The Vandals easily conquered the island in the fifth century. The Byzantine Empire recovered it in 534. Following the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, Menorca was annexed to the Caliphate of Córdoba in 903, with many Muslims emigrating to the island.

&quot;Manûrqa&quot; () was the Arabicized name given to the island by the Muslims from its annexation to the Caliphate of Cordoba by &#x27;Isâm al-Khawlânî in 903 until the rule of the last Muslim ra&#x27;îs, Abû &#x27;Umar ibn Sa&#x27;îd in 1287. The only urban centre of the island was &quot;Madînat al Jazîra&quot; or &quot;al Manûrqa&quot; (modern Ciutadella). Most of the population lived in small farm communities organized under a tribal structure.

In 1231, after Christian forces took Mallorca, Menorca chose to become an independent Islamic state, albeit one tributary to King James I of Aragon. The island was ruled first by Abû &#x27;Uthmân Sa&#x27;îd Hakam al Qurashi (1234–1282), and following his death by his son, Abû &#x27;Umar ibn Sa&#x27;îd (1282–1287).

A Catalan-Aragonese invasion, led by Alfonso III (also known as Count of Barcelona Alfons II), came on 17 January 1287; its anniversary is now celebrated as Menorca&#x27;s national day. Once the island was captured, most of its Muslim inhabitants were enslaved and sold in the slave markets of Eivissa, Valencia and Barcelona, while others became Christians.

After the Christian conquest of 1287, the island was part of the Crown of Aragon. For some time it was ceded to the Kingdom of Mallorca, a vassal state of the Crown, but it was retaken by the king of Aragon in 1343. Eventually the Crown of Aragon merged with the Crown of Castile, and so Menorca became part of Spain.

During the 16th century, Turkish naval attacks destroyed Mahon, and the then capital, Ciutadella. In Mahon, Barbary pirates from North Africa took considerable booty and as many as 6,000 slaves. Various Spanish kings, including Philip III and Philip IV, styled themselves &quot;King of Minorca&quot; as a subsidiary title.

=== British rule ===

Captured by Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy in 1708 during the War of the Spanish Succession, Minorca became a British possession. It was formally ceded to Great Britain in 1713, under the terms of Article XI of the Treaty of Utrecht. Under the governorship of General Richard Kane, this period saw the island&#x27;s capital moved to Port Mahon and a naval base established in that town&#x27;s harbour.

In 1756, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, France captured the island after the Siege of Fort St Philip and a failed British relief attempt. The 1763 Treaty of Paris enabled the British to return to the island after Britain&#x27;s victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1781, during the American War of Independence, the British were defeated for a second time, in this instance by a combination of French and Spanish forces, and on 5 January 1782 the Spanish regained control of the island, after a long siege of St. Philip&#x27;s Castle in Port Mahon. The British ceded the island back to Spain the next year in the Treaty of Versailles. Menorca was invaded by the British once again in 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars, but it was finally repossessed by Spain by the terms of the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The British influence can still be seen in local architecture, with elements such as sash windows.

===Renewed Spanish rule===

As with the rest of the Balearic Islands, Menorca was not occupied by the French during the Peninsular War, as it was successfully protected by the Royal Navy, this time allied to Spain.

A quarantine station (lazaretto), Llatzaret (Catalan), was constructed from 1793 to 1807 next to the entrance to the Port Mahon. It served ships from North Africa wishing to reach the Iberian Peninsula or the ports of the Balearic Islands. Lazarettos confined the crews of ships that were suspected of carrying infectious diseases, such as the plague. The crew needed to spend up to 40 days within its walls until it was clear there was no infection or until the sick recovered. It is now a national monument and can only be reached as part of an official tour.

From 1815 until the mid-19th century, the U.S. Navy developed its Mediterranean headquarters at Port Mahon, leaving behind the English Cemetery, which was restored by the Spanish government in 2008 and is maintained in the 21st century.

=== Since 1900 ===
During the Spanish Civil War, Menorca stayed loyal to the Republican Spanish Government, while the rest of the Balearic Islands supported the Spanish Nationalists. The island did not see ground combat, but it was a target of aerial bombing by the pro-Nationalist Italians of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie Air Force. Many Menorcans were also killed when taking part in a failed invasion of Mallorca. During the Pedro Marqués Barber era (July–December 1936) some Mallorcans and a priest were executed on the island. After the Nationalist victory in the Battle of Minorca in February 1939, the British Navy assisted in a peaceful transfer of power in Menorca and the evacuation of some political refugees aboard .

In October 1993, Menorca was designated by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve. In July 2005, the island&#x27;s application to become the 25th member of the International Island Games Association was approved.

== Climate ==
As the major part of Balearic Islands, Menorca has a mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with mild winters and hot summers. Menorca is generally wetter than Mallorca, with rainfall peaking in late autumn. Average annual highs range between in winter to in summer. Due to its offshore position and the small size of the island, temperatures are generally quite stable.

== Culture ==

The location of Menorca in the middle of the western Mediterranean was a staging point for the different cultures since prehistoric times. This Balearic Island has a mix of colonial and local architecture.

The &quot;festes&quot; take place throughout the summer in different towns around the island, and have their origins in the early 14th century. The international opera week and international organ festival in Mahón, and the summer music festival and Capella Davidica concerts in Ciutadella are the main events of the island.

Menorca&#x27;s cuisine is dominated by the Mediterranean diet, which is known to be very healthy. While many of the locals have adopted modern attitudes they still uphold certain old traditions.

=== Traditional celebrations ===

Menorca is especially well known for its traditional summer &quot;festes&quot;, which intrigue many visitors. The Saint John&#x27;s Feast is held annually in Ciutadella de Menorca, during 23–25 June. The festes last for three days. On the first day, a man bears a well-groomed sheep upon his shoulders and parades around the local streets. In the late evening, main streets are closed, and bonfires held upon them.

On the second day, locally bred black horses are dressed with ribbons and rosettes. The riders, or &quot;caixers&quot;, ride the horses through the streets and, along with a tumultuous crowd of people, encourage them to rear up on their hind legs. The brave can be found running underneath them in an attempt to touch the horses hearts for good luck. 

The third day sees intense competition between the riders in a harmless form of jousting that involves spearing a suspended ring with a lance at considerable speed. The festes are brought to a close with a firework display.

=== Sports ===
As a small island, Menorca offers limited opportunities to see top-level sport competitions. Football in Menorca is played at the fifth level of the Spanish football pyramid. There are currently 11 clubs contesting the Regional Preferente de Menorca, the champion of which progresses to the Tercera División Grupo XI playoffs. The winner of this playoff is promoted to Tercera División; the last Menorquí club to do so was CF Sporting Mahonés in 2009.

CV Ciutadella are a professional women&#x27;s volleyball club who play in the Superliga Femenina, the top league of Spanish volleyball, having won the league championship in 2011 and 2012. They play at Pavelló Municipal d&#x27;Esports in Ciutadella.

A semi-professional basketball club, CB Menorca, play in the LEB Plata, the third level of Spanish basketball. Their home court is Pavelló Menorca in the Bintaufa neighborhood just outside of Maó.

In recent years, some sporting events that gather hundreds of participants have been successfully held on a yearly basis, such as the triathlon race Extreme Man Menorca and the single-staged ultramarathon race Trail Menorca Camí de Cavalls. In 2014, it was announced that the island would host the 18th editions of the Island Games in 2019; however, Menorca later pulled out of hosting the event, citing a change of government as the main reason.

=== Language ===

The two official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Natives to the island speak the variety of Catalan called &quot;Menorquí&quot;, and Spanish as well; many residents originating from the mainland are monolingual in Spanish. The language of education and of government is Catalan, with Spanish taught alongside it.

A 2014 survey carried out by the government of the Balearic Islands found that 53.5% of participants identified themselves as Catalan speakers, 36.7% as Spanish speakers, and 7.7% as bilingual speakers.

The Catalan spoken in Menorca is a variety known as &quot;Menorquí&quot;. Between &quot;Menorquí&quot; and standard Catalan, as with most Balearic dialects, the most distinctive difference is the word used for the article &quot;the&quot;, where &quot;Menorquí&quot; uses &quot;es&quot; for masculine and &quot;sa&quot; for feminine. Menorquí thus shares the source of its article with many Sardinian varieties (masc. sing. &quot;su&quot;, fem sing. &quot;sa&quot;), rather than the standard Catalan &quot;el&quot; and &quot;la&quot;, similar to other Romance languages (e.g. Spanish &quot;el&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, Italian &quot;il&quot;, &quot;la&quot;), corresponding to a form which was historically used along the Costa Brava of Catalonia, from where it is supposed that the islands were repopulated after being conquered from the Moors.

Menorquí also has a few English loan words dating back to the period of British rule, such as &quot;grevi&quot;, &quot;xumaquer&quot;, &quot;boinder&quot; and &quot;xoc&quot; taken from &quot;gravy&quot;, &quot;shoemaker&quot;, &quot;bow window&quot; and &quot;chalk&quot;, respectively.

=== Food and drink ===

Wine production has been known on the island since ancient times, but it went into a heavy decline over the last century. Now, several new, small wineries have started up, producing wines locally.

Lingering British influence is seen in the Menorcans&#x27; taste for gin, which during local &quot;festes&quot; honoring towns&#x27; patron saints is mixed with lemonade (or bitter lemon) to make a golden liquid known as &quot;Pomada&quot;. Gin from Menorca is not derived from grain alcohol but from wine alcohol (eau de vie de vin), making it more akin to brandy. It has the distinction to have geographical identity protection. Probably the best known gin is Gin Xoriguer which is named after the typical Menorcan windmill which was used to make the first gin. One of the reasons it is also known as Gin de Minorca or Gin de Mahón.

Mayonnaise is thought to take its name from the capital of the island. According to this theory, it was first prepared by a French chef in 1756 as part of a victory feast after capturing Port Mahon, Minorca. In those days, sauces were prepared by combining cream and eggs. The French chef needed cream to prepare a sauce, but the cream was nowhere to be found. Therefore, he replaced it with olive oil, creating mayonnaise. The name mayonnaise originates from the capital of the island, Mahón. 

Also famous is Mahón cheese, &quot;formatge de Maó&quot;, a cheese typical of the island.

Sweets known as flaons are one of the typical gastronomic products of Menorca.

==Wildlife==
===Flowers===
Menorca is rich in wild flowers with over 900 species of flowering plants recorded. Many are those typical of the Mediterranean, but some are endemic. There are 24 or 25 species of orchid found and of these most flower early in the year in late March, April and May.

===Insects===

30 species of butterflies have been recorded on Menorca and most are on the wing from March to late September. The species that occur include the Cleopatra, Lang&#x27;s short tailed blue and the two-tailed pasha.

Despite not having many large wetlands dragonflies abound on Menorca. Seventeen species have been recorded including the emperor dragonfly.

===Reptiles and amphibians===
There are three species of amphibians: green toad (&quot;Bufo viridis&quot;), marsh frog and stripeless tree frog (&quot;Hyla meridionalis&quot;).
The common lizard seen all over the island is the Italian wall lizard (&quot;Podarcis siculus&quot;) although the Moroccan rock lizard (&quot;Scelaris perspicillata&quot;) also occurs. The Balearic endemic Lilford&#x27;s wall lizard (&quot;Podarcis lilfordi&quot;) can be found on many of the offshore islands. Two species of gecko can be found on Menorca, the Moorish (&quot;Tarentola mauritanica&quot;) and the Turkish (&quot;Hemidactylus turcicus&quot;) also called the Mediterranean house gecko.
Four species of snake occur: the viperine snake (&quot;Natrix maura&quot;), grass snake, false smooth snake (&quot;Macroprotodon cucullatus&quot;) and the ladder snake (&quot;Rhinechis scalaris&quot;).

Hermann&#x27;s tortoise (&quot;Testudo hermanni&quot;) is quite common and can be found all over the island. Two terrapin species are also found, the native European pond terrapin (&quot;Emys orbicularis&quot;) and the introduced American red-eared slider&quot; (Trachemys scripta&quot;).

===Birds===
The birdlife of Menorca is very well known. Menorca is a well watched island which is on the migration route of many species and good number of passage migrants can be seen in spring. Residents include Audouin&#x27;s gull, blue rock thrush and Thekla lark. Booted eagle and red kite are easy to see as is Egyptian vulture in the right habitat. In summer there are bee-eaters and Menorca has major colonies of Cory&#x27;s shearwater and Balearic shearwater.

===Mammals===
Menorca has no large native mammals. There are some small mammals including rabbits, bats, rats, mice, pine martens and a subspecies of North African hedgehog.

== Municipalities ==
The major towns are Port Mahon and Ciutadella de Menorca. The island is administratively divided into eight municipalities (from west to east):
*Ciutadella de Menorca (or just &quot;Ciutadella&quot; locally) – the ancient capital of Menorca until 1722.
*Ferreries
*Es Mercadal
**Fornells, which belongs to the municipality of Es Mercadal. Famous for its lobster stew (&quot;caldereta&quot;). 
*Es Migjorn Gran (or &quot;Es Mitjorn Gran&quot;) – hometown of supercentarian Joan Riudavets.
*Alaior
**Cala En Porter – a tourist and residential area
*Port Mahon (officially &quot;Maó&quot; in Catalan, &quot;Mahón&quot; in Spanish) – became the capital in 1722 during British rule due to its strategic natural harbour.
**Llucmassanes – a small hamlet which belongs to the municipality of Maó.
**Sant Climent, which belongs to the municipality of Maó.
*Es Castell – Founded by the British and originally named as Georgetown.
*Sant Lluís – Founded by the French and originally named Saint-Louis.

The areas and populations of the municipalities (according to the &quot;Instituto Nacional de Estadística&quot;, Spain) are:

==Politics and government==
===Insular government===
====Results of the elections to the Island Council of Menorca====
Elections are held every four years concurrently with local elections. From 1983 to 2007, councilors were indirectly elected from the results of the election to Parliament of the Balearic Islands for the constituency of Menorca. Since 2007, however, separate direct elections are held to elect the Council.
== Transport ==
Menorca has several roads that go around the island, the most important one being Me-1 road (Spain), which goes from the island&#x27;s capital, Mahón, to Ciutadella. Menorca also has many bus lines, most of them only operated in the summer due to tourism. The most important line is line 01, which goes through Me-1 passing through all municipalities except Es Castell and Sant Lluís.

<doc id="59743" wikidata="Q696490" url="?curid=59743" title="Panic attack">
<text>Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear and discomfort that may include palpitations, otherwise defined as a rapid, irregular heartbeat, sweating, chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, trembling, dizziness, numbness, confusion, or a sense of impending doom or loss of control. Typically, these symptoms are the worst within ten minutes of onset and can last for roughly 30 minutes, though they can vary anywhere from seconds to hours. While they can be extremely distressing, panic attacks themselves are not physically dangerous.

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition&quot; (DSM-5) defines them as &quot;an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and during which time four or more of the following symptoms occur.&quot; These symptoms include, but are not limited to, the ones mentioned above.

Panic attacks function as a marker for assessing severity, course, and comorbidity (the simultaneous presence of two or more diagnoses) of different disorders, including anxiety disorders. Hence, panic attacks can be applied to all disorders found in the DSM.

Panic attacks can be caused by an identifiable source, or they may happen without any warning and without a specific, recognizable situation.

Some known causes that increase the risk of having a panic attack include medical and psychiatric conditions (e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder, depression), substances (e.g., nicotine, caffeine), and psychological stress.

Before making a diagnosis, physicians seek to eliminate other conditions that can produce similar symptoms, such as hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), hyperparathyroidism (an overactive parathyroid), heart disease, lung disease, and dysautonomia, disease of the system that regulates the body&#x27;s involuntary processes.
Treatment of panic attacks should be directed at the underlying cause. In those with frequent attacks, counseling or medications may be used, as both preventative and abortive measures, ones that stop the attack while it is happening. Breathing training and muscle relaxation techniques may also be useful.

Panic attacks often appear frightening to both those experiencing and those witnessing them, and often, people tend to think they are having heart attacks due to the symptoms. However, they do not cause any real physical harm.

Previous studies have suggested that those who suffer from anxiety-related disorders (e.g., panic disorder) are at higher risk of suicide.
In Europe, approximately 3% of the population has a panic attack in a given year, while in the United States, they affect about 11%. Panic attacks are more prevalent in females than males and often begin during puberty or early adulthood. Children and older adults are less commonly affected.

==Signs and symptoms==
When people experience a panic attack, it usually comes on very suddenly and unexpectedly with a wide range of symptoms that tend to last, on average, a few minutes. Typically, the symptoms of panic attacks reach their worst intensity in the first minute, before subsiding over the course of several minutes. During this time, people often feel intense fear that something catastrophic will happen despite there being no immediate danger. The frequency of panic attacks vary between individuals, with some people experiencing a panic attack as frequently as every week, while others could have one panic attack per year. The features that help define a panic attack are the collection of symptoms that accompany a panic attack as well as the fact that a panic attack occurs unprompted; meaning there is usually no triggering event that causes a panic attack.

Panic attacks are associated with many different symptoms, with a person experiencing at least four of the following symptoms: increased heart rate, chest pain, palpitations (i.e. feeling like your heart is pounding out of your chest), difficulty breathing, choking sensation, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, lightheadedness (i.e. feeling like you might pass out), numbness or tingling (also called paresthesias), derealization (i.e. feeling detached from reality, like the events occurring are not real), depersonalization (i.e. feeling disconnected from your body or thoughts), fear of losing control, and fear of dying.

These physical symptoms are interpreted with alarm in people prone to panic attacks. This results in increased anxiety and forms a positive feedback loop, meaning that the more a person experiences symptoms associated with a panic attack, the more they experience feelings of anxiety which serve to worsen their panic attacks. Panic attacks are distinguished from other forms of anxiety by their intensity and their sudden, episodic nature. 

=== Chest pain ===
People can experience a wide range of symptoms during their panic attacks; they tend to be very intense and frightening and the common symptoms of difficulty breathing and chest pain can sometimes cause people to believe they are having a heart attack, leading them to go to the emergency department. Because chest pain and difficulty breathing are commonly symptoms of some sort of heart disease (such as a heart attack), there is medical importance in ruling out life-threatening reasons for their symptoms. A heart attack (also called a myocardial infarction) occurs when there is a blockage in the arteries going to the heart, causing less blood to get to the heart tissue, and ultimately causing the heart tissue to die. This will be evaluated in the emergency department with an electrocardiogram (i.e. a picture of the electrical activity of the heart) and by measuring a hormone called troponin, which is released from the heart tissue during times of stress on the tissue.

==Causes==

Panic attacks can be caused by a mix of factors. Biological factors that may lead to panic attacks include psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), heart conditions, low blood pressure, and an overactive thyroid. Imbalance of the norepinephrine system, which is responsible for coordinating the body&#x27;s fight-or-flight response, has been linked to panic attacks as well.

Panic disorder tends to arise in early adulthood, though it can occur at any age. It is more common in women and usually arises more in individuals with above-average intelligence. Research involving identical twins has shown that if one twin has an anxiety disorder, the other is likely to have one too.

Panic attacks may also occur due to short-term stressors. Major personal losses, like the end of a romantic relationship, life transitions such as jobs or moving, and other significant life changes may trigger a panic attack. Individuals who are naturally anxious, need a lot of reassurance, worry excessively about their health, have an overcautious view of the world, and have cumulative stress are more likely to experience panic attacks. For adolescents, social transitions, such as changes in classes and schools, may also be a contributing factor.

People often experience panic attacks as a direct result of exposure to specific fears or phobias. A situation can become associated to panic if someone has had a previous reaction before in similar contexts. 

Substances may also induce panic attacks. For example, discontinuation or reduction in the dose of a drug (drug withdrawal) without tapering can cause panic attacks. Other substances that are commonly known to be associated with panic attacks include cannabis and nicotine.

===Panic disorder===
People who have repeated, persistent attacks or feel severe anxiety about having another attack are said to have panic disorder. Panic disorder is strikingly different from other types of anxiety disorders in that panic attacks are often sudden and unprovoked. However, panic attacks experienced by those with panic disorder may also be linked to or heightened by exposure to certain places or situations, making daily life difficult.

If a person has repeated and unexpected panic attacks, this could be a potential sign of panic disorder. According to the DSM-5, panic disorder can be diagnosed if a patient has not only recurrent panic attacks but also experiences at least a month of anxiety or worry about having additional attacks. This concern may lead to the person to modify their behavior to avoid situations that triggered the attack. Panic disorder cannot be diagnosed if the patient has another disorder that is causing the panic attacks (e.g., social anxiety disorder).

Patients affected by panic disorder can struggle with depression and a diminished quality of life. Compared to the general population, they are also at increased risk for substance abuse and addiction.

===Agoraphobia===

Panic disorder frequently presents with agoraphobia, which is an anxiety disorder where the individual presents with fear of a situation from which they cannot leave or escape, especially if a panic attack occurs. People who have had a panic attack in certain situations may develop phobias of these situations and begin to take measure to avoid them. Eventually, the pattern of avoidance and level of anxiety about another attack may reach the point where individuals with panic disorder are unable to drive or even step out of the house, preferring the comfort of remaining in a safe and known place. At this stage, the person is said to have panic disorder with agoraphobia.

In Japan, people who exhibit extreme agoraphobia to the point of becoming unwilling or unable to leave their homes are referred to as &quot;Hikikomori&quot;. This term is used to describe both the person and the phenomenon. After first being defined by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, a national research task force refined the definition as &quot;the state of avoiding social engagement (e.g., education, employment, and friendships) with generally persistent withdrawal into one’s residence for at least six months as a result of various factors.&quot;

==Pathophysiology==

When panic attacks occur, people experience the sudden onset of fear and anxiety in the setting of no actual perceived threat (ex. your mind believes there is something threatening your wellbeing, but there is nothing actual life-threatening occurring). This fear-based response leads to a release of a hormone called adrenaline (also known as epinephrine), which brings about the fight-or-flight response. The human nervous state consists of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the fight-or-flight (active) response, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the rest-and-digest (passive) response. The sympathetic nervous system prepares our body for strenuous physical activity (i.e. fight or flight) by affecting different bodily functions such as increasing heart rate, increasing breathing, sweating and many others, leading to the physical symptoms that accompany a panic attack. The exact mechanism behind panic attacks remains unclear; there are several different ideas for why some people experience panic attacks while others don&#x27;t. The current theories include the fear network model, theory of acid-base disturbances in the brain, and irregular activity of the amygdala (i.e. the part of the brain responsible for controlling emotions, such as fear, and identifying threats).

=== Fear network model ===
The fear network model hypothesizes that parts of our brain responsible for controlling the fear response that is created by the area of the brain where the amygdala is located (called the limbic system) is unable to control the fear sufficiently, leading to panic attacks. It is thought that dysfunction of the area responsible for controlling fear could be due to stress experienced in childhood, along with a genetic component as well. In summary, the fear network model states that the network in our brains responsible for responding to fear and then controlling that fear is not working properly, creating the inability for our brains to control fear that is occurring without any sort of external threat, leading to panic attacks.

=== Acid-base disturbances theory ===
This theory suggests that there is a part of the amygdala that is able to identify when the pH in our brain decreases, i.e. becomes more acidic. This part of the amygdala is called the acid-sensing ion channel. Since panic attacks typically occur without an obvious external trigger (meaning there is usually nothing life-threatening happening to cause a panic attack), studies have shown that panic attacks may be caused by internal triggers. One such internal trigger is the amygdala sensing acidosis, which can be caused by inhaling CO2 (carbon dioxide). In fact, one study has shown that people with a history of panic attacks had disturbances in their pH level minutes before having a panic attack.

Another theory, called the false suffocation alarm theory, is associated with the idea of acid-base imbalances in the amygdala. In this theory, inhalation of CO2 causes accumulation of acid in the blood and difficulty breathing, leading our brain to believe that we are suffocating, causing fear and panic. Studies have shown that inhaling CO2 can cause fear in people who do not have any prior history of panic attacks. This information has allowed scientists to suggest that panic attacks could be caused by our brain&#x27;s inability to stop alarm signals that make us feel like we&#x27;re suffocating.

=== Amygdala dysfunction theory ===
The amygdala in the human brain has several distinct sections that are responsible for our fear response. This theory suggests that problems in any of these brain areas or the connections between them could lead to excessive fear responses, like panic attacks. Studies have shown that in both animal and human subjects with a history of panic attacks, the amygdala is hyperactive with decreased volume when compared to the control. Another role the amygdala may play in panic attacks is decreased inhibition of amygdalar activity (i.e. the amygdala is not being shut down like it normally should), leading to increased levels of anxiety. A link between childhood traumatic experiences, as well as genetic abnormalities, has been found in those with a dysfunctional amygdala.

===Neurotransmitter imbalances===
Many neurotransmitters are affected when the body is under the increased stress and anxiety that accompany a panic attack. Some include serotonin, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate.

An increase of serotonin in certain pathways of the brain seems to be correlated with reduced anxiety. More evidence that suggests serotonin plays a role in anxiety is that people who take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) tend to feel a reduction of anxiety when their brain has more serotonin available to use.

The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) is GABA. This neurotransmitter acts by inhibiting, or blocking nerve signals, which is very helpful in anxiety. In fact, medications that increase GABA activity in the brain, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, help with reducing anxiety almost immediately.

Dopamine&#x27;s role in anxiety is not well understood. Some antipsychotic medications that block dopamine production have been proven to treat anxiety. However, this may be attributed to dopamine&#x27;s tendency to increase feelings of self-efficacy and confidence, which indirectly reduces anxiety. On the other hand, other medications that increase dopamine levels have also been found to improve anxiety.

Many physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heart rate and hand tremors, are regulated by norepinephrine. Drugs that counteract norepinephrine&#x27;s effect may be effective in reducing the physical symptoms of a panic attack. On the other hand, some medications that raise overall norepinephrine levels, such as tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), can be effective for treating panic attacks over the long term by reducing the sudden increases in norepinephrine that happen during a panic attack.

Because glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter involved in the central nervous system (CNS), it can be found in almost every neural pathway in the body. Glutamate is likely involved in conditioning, which is the process by which certain fears are formed, and extinction, which is the elimination of those fears.

=== Cardiac mechanism ===
People who have been diagnosed with panic disorder have approximately double the risk of heart disease. Panic attacks can cause chest pain by affecting blood flow in arteries of the heart. During a panic attack, the body&#x27;s stress response is triggered which can cause the small vessels of the heart to tighten, leading to chest pain. The body&#x27;s nervous system and rapid breathing during a panic attack can cause spasming of the arteries of the heart (also known as vasospasm). This can reduce blood flow to the heart, causing damage to heart tissue and chest pain, despite normal heart scans.

In individuals with a history of coronary artery disease, panic attacks and stress can make chest pain worse by increasing the heart&#x27;s need for oxygen. This occurs because increased heart rate, blood pressure, and stress responses (i.e. the sympathetic nervous system) puts more strain on the heart.

==Diagnosis==
According to the DSM-5, a panic attack is part of the diagnostic class of anxiety disorders. DSM-5 criteria for a panic attack is defined as &quot;&quot;an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and during which time four or more of the following symptoms occur&quot;:&quot; 
*Palpitations, and/or accelerated heart rate
*Sweating
*Trembling or shaking
*Sensations of shortness of breath or being smothered
*Feeling of choking
*Chest pain or discomfort
*Nausea or abdominal distress
*Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint
*Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)
*Fear of losing control or going insane
*Sense of impending doom
*Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)
*Chills or heat sensations

While some patients go to the emergency department due to their physical symptoms, there is no laboratory or imaging test used to diagnose panic attacks, it is a purely clinical diagnosis (i.e., the doctor uses their experience and expertise to diagnose panic attacks) once other more life-threatening diseases have been ruled out. Due to the physical symptoms that occur with a panic attack, people tend go to the emergency department for further evaluation; however, those who are experiencing panic attacks that are affecting their health and wellness should be seen by a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychiatrist. Screening tools, such as the Panic Disorder Screener (PADIS), can be used to detect possible cases of panic disorder and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment with a psychiatrist for further evaluation.

==Treatment==
Panic disorder is usually effectively managed with a variety of interventions, including psychological therapies and pharmacological treatment with medication. The focus on management of panic disorder involves reducing the frequency and intensity of panic attacks, reducing anticipatory anxiety and agoraphobia, and achieving full remission.

If a patient is experiencing a panic attack, most will resolve spontaneously within a course of 20 to 30 minutes without interference. However, benzodiazepines, specifically alprazolam and clonazepam, are frequently prescribed for panic disorder due to their quick onset of action and good tolerability and can thus be used as a way to end a current, on-going attack. Additionally, deep breathing techniques and relaxation can be used and are found to be helpful while the person is experiencing a panic attack or immediately after as a way to calm oneself. Some maintaining causes include avoidance of panic-provoking situations or environments, anxious or negative self-talk (&quot;what-if&quot; thinking), mistaken beliefs (e.g., thinking one’s symptoms are harmful or dangerous), and withheld feelings.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has the most complete and longest duration of effect, followed by specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A 2009 review found positive results from therapy and medication and a much better result when the two were combined.

===Lifestyle changes===
Growing research suggests that along with standardized medical treatments, lifestyle changes can help alleviate some of the most common mental health conditions. Because of this, there has been a growing emphasis on the potential of lifestyle interventions and non-pharmacological methods for anxiety. These lifestyle interventions include, but are not limited to, focusing on physical activity, substance avoidance, and relaxation techniques.

Exercise, especially aerobic, have become an alternative method for decreasing symptoms of anxiety and panic. Other more relaxing forms, such as yoga and tai chi, have also had similar effects in improving anxiety and can also be used as adjunctive therapy. Numerous studies have determined that exercise is inversely related to anxiety symptoms, thus as physical activity increases, levels of anxiety seem to decrease. There is evidence that suggests that this effect is correlated to the release of exercise-induced endorphins and the subsequent reduction of the stress hormone, cortisol. One thing to keep in mind is that with exercise, often comes increased respiration rate. This can lead to hyperventilation and hyperventilation syndrome, which mimics symptoms of a heart attack, thus inducing a panic attack, so it is important to pace the exercise regimen accordingly.

Substance avoidance can be important in reducing anxiety and panic symptoms, as many substances can cause, exacerbate, or mimic symptoms of panic disorder. For example, caffeine has been known to have anxiety and panic-inducing properties that can especially present in those who are more susceptible to panic attacks. Anxiety and panic can also temporarily increase during withdrawal from caffeine and various other drugs and substances.

Meditation may also be helpful in the treatment of panic disorder. Muscle relaxation techniques are useful to some individuals as well. These can be learned using recordings, videos, or books. While muscle relaxation has proved to be less effective than cognitive behavioral therapy in controlled trials, many people still find at least temporary relief from muscle relaxation.

===Breathing exercises===
Irregularities in breathing, including hyperventilation and shortness of breath, are key features of anxiety and panic attacks. Hyperventilation syndrome occurs when an individual experiences deep, quick-paced breathing, eventually affecting blood flow to the brain and altering conscious awareness.

It has been shown that several various breathwork techniques can reduce symptoms in patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders. By managing and focusing on breathing, individuals with anxiety experience less tension and stress in their muscles, as well as a diminished stress response. Breathing retraining exercise helps to rebalance the oxygen and CO2 levels in the blood, improving cerebral blood flow. Capnometry, which provides exhaled CO2 levels, may help guide breathing.

David D. Burns recommends breathing exercises for those with anxiety. One such breathing exercise is a 5-2-5 count. Using the stomach (or diaphragm)—and not the chest—inhale (feel the stomach come out, as opposed to the chest expanding) for 5 seconds. As the maximal point at inhalation is reached, hold the breath for 2 seconds. Then slowly exhale, over 5 seconds. Repeat this cycle twice and then breathe &#x27;normally&#x27; for 5 cycles (1 cycle = 1 inhale + 1 exhale). The point is to focus on breathing and relax the heart rate.

Although breathing into a paper bag was a common recommendation for short-term treatment of symptoms of an acute panic attack, it has been criticized as inferior to measured breathing.

===Therapy===
According to the American Psychological Association, &quot;most specialists agree that a combination of cognitive and behavioral therapies are the best treatment for panic disorder. Medication might also be appropriate in some cases.&quot; The first part of therapy is largely informational; many people are greatly helped by simply understanding exactly what panic disorder is and how many others experience it. Many people with panic disorder are worried that their panic attacks mean they are &quot;going crazy&quot; or that the panic might induce a heart attack. Cognitive restructuring helps people to replace those thoughts with more realistic, positive ways of viewing the attacks. Avoidant behavior, such as what is seen in patients with agoraphobia, is one of the key aspects that prevent people with frequent panic attacks from functioning healthily. Exposure therapy, which includes repeated and prolonged confrontation with feared situations and body sensations, helps weaken anxiety responses to panic-inducing external and internal stimuli.

In deeper-level psychoanalytic approaches, in particular object relations theory, panic attacks are frequently associated with splitting (psychology), paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions, and paranoid anxiety. They are often found to be comorbid with borderline personality disorder and child sexual abuse.

There was a meta-analysis of the comorbidity of panic disorders and agoraphobia that used exposure therapy to treat hundreds of patients over a period of time. A result was that thirty-two percent of patients had a panic episode after treatment. They concluded that the use of exposure therapy has lasting efficacy for a client who is living with a panic disorder and agoraphobia.

=== Medication ===
Medication options for panic attacks typically include benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Benzodiazepines are being prescribed less often because of their potential side effects such as dependence, fatigue, slurred speech, and memory loss. Antidepressant treatments for panic attacks include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). 

SSRIs in particular tend to be the first drug treatment used to treat panic attacks. SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants appear similar for short-term efficacy.

SSRIs carry a relatively low risk since they are not associated with much tolerance or dependence, and have a more tolerable side effect profile. TCAs are similar to SSRIs in their many advantages but come with more common side effects such as weight gain and cognitive disturbances. MAOIs are generally suggested for patients who have not responded to other forms of treatment.

While the use of drugs in treating panic attacks can be very successful, it is generally recommended that people also be in some form of therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Drug treatments are usually used throughout the duration of panic attack symptoms and discontinued after the patient has been free of symptoms for at least six months. It is usually safest to discontinue these drugs gradually while undergoing therapy. While drug treatment seems promising for children and adolescents, they are at an increased risk of suicide while taking these medications and their well-being should be monitored closely.

==Prognosis==
Panic attacks, while unpleasant, are not life-threatening. However, recurrent panic attacks can negatively affect one&#x27;s mental health if people experiencing them do not seek treatment. Sometimes, panic attacks can develop into phobias or panic disorder if untreated. However, when treated, people do very well, with symptoms decreasing or fully disappearing within several weeks to months.

==Epidemiology==
In Europe, about 3% of the population has a panic attack in a given year. In the United States, they affect about 11%. Panic attacks are more common in females than in males. They often begin during puberty or early adulthood. Children and older people are less commonly affected. Results from twin and family studies have concluded that disorders, such as panic disorder, have a genetic component and are inherited or passed down through genes.

<text>The brown recluse (Loxosceles reclusa, Sicariidae, formerly placed in a family &quot;Loxoscelidae&quot;) is a recluse spider with necrotic venom. Similar to those of other recluse spiders, their bites sometimes require medical attention. The brown recluse is one of three spiders in North America with dangerous venom, the others being the black widow and the Chilean recluse.

Brown recluse spiders are usually between , but may grow larger. While typically light to medium brown, they range in color from whitish to dark brown or blackish gray. The cephalothorax and abdomen are not necessarily the same color. These spiders usually have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax, with a black line coming from it that looks like a violin with the neck of the violin pointing to the rear of the spider, resulting in the nicknames fiddleback spider, brown fiddler, or violin spider.

==Description==

The violin pattern is not a definitive identifier, as other spiders can have similar markings (e.g. cellar spiders and pirate spiders). Instead, while most spiders have eight eyes, recluse spiders have six eyes arranged in pairs (dyads) with one median pair and two lateral pairs. Only a few other spiders have three pairs of eyes arranged in this way (e.g., scytodids). Recluses have no obvious coloration patterns on the abdomen or legs, and the legs lack spines.
The violin marking can vary in intensity depending on the age of the brown recluse spider, with mature spiders typically having dark violin shapes.

==Distribution==

The documented range of this species lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through southern Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana to southwestern Ohio. In the southern states, it is native from central Texas to western Georgia and north to Kentucky.

Despite rumors to the contrary, the brown recluse spider has not established itself in California or anywhere outside its native range. There are other species of the genus &quot;Loxosceles&quot; native to the southwestern part of the United States, including California, which may resemble the brown recluse, but interactions between humans and the recluse species in California and the region are rare because those species native ranges lie outside of dense human populations. The number of &quot;false positive&quot; reports based on misidentifications is considerable; in a nationwide study where people submitted spiders that they thought were brown recluses, of 581 from California only one was a brown recluse—submitted by a family that moved from Missouri and brought it with them (compared to specimens submitted from Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma, where between 75% and 90% were recluses).
From this study, the most common spider submitted from California as a brown recluse was in the genus &quot;Titiotus&quot;, whose bite is deemed harmless. A similar study documented that various arachnids were routinely misidentified by physicians, pest control operators, and other non-expert authorities, who told their patients or clients that the spider they had was a brown recluse when in fact it was not.
Despite the absence of brown recluses from the Western U.S., physicians in the region commonly diagnose &quot;brown recluse bites&quot;, leading to the popular misconception that the spiders inhabit those areas.

Over the last century, spiders have occasionally been intercepted in locations where they have no known established populations; these spiders may be transported fairly easily, though the lack of &quot;established&quot; populations well outside the natural range also indicates that such movement has not led to the colonization of new areas, after decades of opportunities. Note that the occurrence of brown recluses in a single building (such as a warehouse) outside of the native range is not considered as successful colonization; such single-building populations can occur (e.g., in several such cases in Florida),
but do not spread, and can be easily eradicated.
The spider has also received numerous sensationalized media reports of bites occurring where these spiders are absent (and no specimens were found), such as a 2014 report from Thailand, where a man was claimed to have died from a brown recluse bite.
Many misidentifications and erroneous geographic records stem from the similarity between &quot;L. reclusa&quot; and a related introduced species, the Mediterranean recluse (&quot;Loxosceles rufescens&quot;), which is found worldwide, including numerous sightings throughout the United States; the two species are superficially almost indistinguishable, and misidentifications are common, making it difficult to distinguish which reports of recluses refer to which species.

==Life cycle==
Adult brown recluse spiders often live about one to two years. Each female produces several egg sacs over a period of two to three months, from May to July, with approximately 50 eggs in each sac. The eggs hatch in about one month. The spiderlings take about one year to grow to adulthood. The brown recluse spider is resilient and can tolerate up to six months of extreme drought and scarcity or absence of food. On one occasion, a brown recluse survived in controlled captivity for over five seasons without any food at all.

As part of the haplogynae, brown recluses do not balloon, which limits their ability to widely disperse geographically.
The brown recluse will, though not habitually, cannibalize another if food becomes scarce; especially during its typical mating season from June to September or when an unreceptive female encounters an aggressive male.

==Behavior==

A brown recluse&#x27;s stance on a flat surface is usually with all legs radially extended. When alarmed it may lower its body, withdraw the forward two legs straight rearward into a defensive position, withdraw the rearmost pair of legs into a position for lunging forward, and stand motionless with pedipalps raised. The pedipalps in mature specimens are dark and quite prominent and are normally held horizontally forward. When threatened it usually flees, seemingly to avoid a conflict, and if detained may further avoid contact with quick horizontal rotating movements or even resort to assuming a lifeless pose (playing dead). The spider does not usually jump unless touched brusquely, and even then its avoidance movement is more of a horizontal lunge rather than a vaulting of itself entirely off the surface. When running, the brown recluse does not leave a silk line behind, which would make it more easily tracked when it is being pursued. Movement at virtually any speed is an evenly paced gait with legs extended.

The brown recluse spider displays autotomy as a defense mechanism against physical, predatory attack to a leg as well as to prevent predatory, venom injections from spreading to the rest of the body. &quot;Once a leg is lost, a recluse spider does not regenerate a new one with subsequent molts&quot;, unlike the huntsman spider, which does regenerate autotomized legs. With each time that a leg is autotomized, the recluse &quot;changes its gait to compensate for the loss.&quot;

==Habitat==
Brown recluse spiders build asymmetrical (irregular) webs that frequently include a shelter consisting of disorderly threads. They frequently build their webs in woodpiles and sheds, closets, garages, plenum spaces, cellars, and other places that are dry and generally undisturbed. When dwelling in human residences they seem to favor cardboard, possibly because it mimics the rotting tree bark which they inhabit naturally. Human-recluse contact often occurs when such isolated spaces are disturbed and the spider feels threatened. Unlike most web weavers, they leave these lairs at night to hunt. Males move around more when hunting than the females, which tend to remain nearer to their webs.

==Bite==

Like all members of the &quot;Loxosceles&quot; genus, the brown recluse has potent tissue-destroying venoms containing the dermonecrotic agent sphingomyelinase D.
Most bites are minor with no dermonecrosis, but a small number of brown recluse bites produce loxoscelism, a condition where the skin around the bite dies. While loxoscelism usually manifests as a skin condition (cutaneous loxoscelism), it can also include systemic symptoms like fever, nausea, and vomiting (viscerocutaneous loxoscelism). In very rare cases, bites can even cause hemolysis – the bursting of red blood cells.
In one study of clinically diagnosed brown recluse bites, skin necrosis occurred 37% of the time, while systemic illness occurred 14% of the time.

As suggested by its specific name &quot;reclusa&quot; (recluse), the brown recluse spider is rarely aggressive, and bites from the species are uncommon. In 2001, more than 2,000 brown recluse spiders were removed from a heavily infested home in Kansas, yet the four residents who had lived there for years were never harmed by the spiders, despite many encounters with them.
The spider usually bites only when pressed against the skin, such as when tangled within clothes, shoes, towels, bedding, inside work gloves, etc. Many human victims report having been bitten after putting on clothes or shoes that had not been worn recently or had been left for many days undisturbed on the floor. The fangs of the brown recluse are not large enough to penetrate most fabric.

When both types of loxoscelism do result, systemic effects may occur before necrosis, as the venom spreads throughout the body in minutes. Children, the elderly, and the debilitatingly ill may be more susceptible to systemic loxoscelism. The systemic symptoms most commonly experienced include nausea, vomiting, fever, rashes, and muscle and joint pain. Rarely, such bites can result in hemolysis, low platelet levels, blood clots throughout the body, organ damage, and even death.
Most fatalities are in children under the age of seven
or those with a weak immune system.

While the majority of brown recluse spider bites do not result in any symptoms, cutaneous symptoms occur more frequently than systemic symptoms. In such instances, the bite forms a necrotizing ulcer as the result of soft tissue destruction and may take months to heal, leaving deep scars. These bites usually become painful and itchy within 2–8 hours. Pain and other local effects worsen 12–36 hours after the bite, and the necrosis develops over the next few days.
Over time, the wound may grow to as large as 25 cm (10 inches). The damaged tissue becomes gangrenous and eventually sloughs away. &quot;L. reclusa&quot; can produce slightly more than 0.1 μL of venom, though the average yield is less.

===Misdiagnosis===
There is an ELISA-based test for brown recluse venom that can determine whether a wound is a brown recluse bite, although it is not commercially available and not in routine clinical use. Clinical diagnoses often use Occam&#x27;s razor principle in diagnosing bites based on what spiders the patient likely encountered and previous similar diagnoses.

 suggested the mnemonic &quot;NOT RECLUSE&quot;, shown below, as a memory device to help laymen and medical professionals more objectively screen and diagnose potential cases of loxoscelism.

There are numerous documented infectious and noninfectious conditions that produce wounds that have been initially misdiagnosed as recluse spider bites by medical professionals, including:

* &quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum&quot;
* Infection by &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;
* Infection by &quot;Streptococcus&quot;
* Herpes
* Diabetic ulcers
* Fungal infection
* Chemical burns
* &quot;Toxicodendron dermatitis&quot;
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Localized vasculitis
* Syphilis
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Sporotrichosis
* Lyme disease
Many of these conditions are far more common and more likely to be the source of necrotic wounds, even in areas where brown recluse spiders actually occur. The most important of these is methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA), a bacterium whose necrotic lesions are very similar to those induced by recluse bites, and which can be lethal if left untreated. Misdiagnosis of MRSA as spider bites is extremely common (nearly 30% of patients with MRSA reported that they initially suspected a spider bite), and can have fatal consequences.

Reported cases of brown recluse bites occur primarily in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas.
There have been many reports of brown recluse bites in California – though a few related species of spiders may be found there, none of the related spiders in California is known to bite humans.

To date, the reports of bites from areas outside of the spider&#x27;s native range have been either unverified or, if verified, the spiders have been moved to those locations by travelers or commerce.

==== Other spiders ====
: &quot;For a comparison of the toxicity of several kinds of spider&quot;
: &quot;bites, see the list of medically significant spider bites&quot;

Many arachnologists believe that a large number of bites attributed to the brown recluse in the U.S. West Coast are either from other spider species or not spider bites at all. Other spiders in western states that might possibly cause necrotic injuries are the hobo spider, desert recluse spider, and the yellow sac spider.

For example, the venom of the hobo spider, a common European species now established in the northwestern United States and southern British Columbia, has been reported to produce similar symptoms as the brown recluse bite when injected into laboratory rabbits. However, the toxicity of hobo spider venom has been called into question: Actual bites (rather than syringe injections) have not been shown to cause necrosis, and no necrotic hobo spider bites have ever been reported where it is native.

Numerous other spiders have been associated with necrotic bites in the medical literature. Other recluse species, such as the desert recluse (found in the deserts of southwestern United States), are reported to have caused necrotic bite wounds, though only rarely.
The hobo spider and the yellow sac spider have also been reported to cause necrotic bites. However, the bites from these spiders are not known to produce the severe symptoms that can follow from a recluse spider bite, and the level of danger posed by these has been called into question.

So far, no known necrotoxins have been isolated from the venom of any of these spiders, and some arachnologists have disputed the accuracy of spider identifications carried out by bite victims, family members, medical responders, and other non-experts in arachnology.
There have been several studies questioning the danger posed by some of the other spiders mentioned: In these studies, scientists examined case studies of bites in which the spider in question was identified by an expert, and found that the incidence of necrotic injury diminished significantly when &quot;questionable&quot; identifications were excluded from the sample set.

===Bite treatment===
First aid involves the application of an ice pack to control inflammation and prompt medical care. If it can be easily captured, the spider should be brought with the patient in a clear, tightly closed container so it may be identified by an arachnologist; if there is no specimen at all, then confirmation by an expert is impossible.

Routine treatment should include immobilization of the affected limb, application of ice, local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis. Many other therapies have been used with varying degrees of success, including hyperbaric oxygen, dapsone, antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine), antibiotics, dextran, glucocorticoids, vasodilators, heparin, nitroglycerin, electric shock, curettage, surgical excision, and antivenom.
In almost all cases, bites are self-limited and typically heal without any medical intervention.

Outpatient palliative care following discharge often consists of a weak or moderate strength opioid (e.g. codeine or tramadol, respectively) depending on pain scores, an anti-inflammatory agent (e.g. naproxen, cortisone), and an antispasmodic (e.g. cyclobenzaprine, diazepam), for a few days to a week. If the pain or spasms have not resolved by this time, a second medical evaluation is generally advised, and differential diagnoses may be considered.

====Specific treatments====
In presumed cases of recluse bites, dapsone is often used for the treatment of necrosis, but controlled clinical trials have yet to demonstrate efficacy.
However, dapsone may be effective in treating many &quot;spider bites&quot; because many such cases are actually misdiagnosed microbial infections.
There have been conflicting reports about its efficacy in treating brown recluse bites, and some have suggested it should no longer be used routinely, if at all.

Wound infection is rare. Antibiotics are not recommended unless there is a credible diagnosis of infection.

Studies have shown that surgical intervention is ineffective and may worsen outcomes. Excision may delay wound healing, cause abscesses, and lead to scarring.

Purportedly application of nitroglycerin stopped necrosis. However, one scientific animal study found no benefit in preventing necrosis, with the study&#x27;s results showing it increased inflammation and caused symptoms of systemic envenoming. The authors concluded the results of the study did not support the use of topical nitroglycerin in brown recluse envenoming. 

Antivenom is available in South America for the venom of related species of recluse spiders. However, the bites, often being painless, usually do not present symptoms until 24 or more hours after the event, possibly limiting the effect of this intervention.

====Spider population control====
Due to increased fear of these spiders prompted by greater public awareness of their presence in recent years, the extermination of domestic brown recluses is performed frequently in the lower midwestern United States. Brown recluse spiders possess a variety of adaptive abilities, including the ability to survive up to 10 months with no food or water. Additionally, these spiders survive significantly longer in a relatively cool, thermally stable environment.

<text>Bored of the Rings is a 1969 parody of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. This short novel was written by Henry Beard and Douglas Kenney, who later founded &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. It was published in 1969 by Signet for &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;, and, unusually for a parody, has remained in print for over 50 years. It has been translated into at least twelve languages.

The parody steps through &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in turn mocking the prologue, the map, and the main text. The text combines slapstick humor with deliberately inappropriate use of brand names.

== Book ==
=== Approach ===

The parody closely follows the outline of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, lampooning the prologue and map of Middle-earth; its main text is a short satirical summary of Tolkien&#x27;s plot. The witty text combines slapstick humour and deliberately inappropriate use of brand names. For example, the carbonated beverages &quot;Moxie&quot; and &quot;Pepsi&quot; replace &quot;Merry&quot; and &quot;Pippin&quot;. Tom Bombadil appears as &quot;Tim Benzedrine&quot;, a stereotypical hippie married to &quot;Hashberry&quot;. Her name alludes to Haight-Ashbury, a district of San Francisco nicknamed Hashbury for its hippie counterculture at that time. Saruman is satirised as Serutan, a laxative, who lives in a &quot;mighty fortress&quot; with &quot;pastel pink-and-blue walls&quot; and a &quot;pale-lavender moat crossed by a bright-green drawbridge&quot;, giving access to an amusement park for tourists. Minas Tirith appears as Minas Troney, designed by Beltelephon the senile.
Other characters include the boggies (Hobbits) Dildo Bugger of Bug End and Frito Bugger (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins), Goddam (Gollum), and Arrowroot, son of Arrowshirt (Aragorn, son of Arathorn).

=== Main text ===

The main text broadly follows the plot of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, its ten chapters roughly corresponding to key chapters of Tolkien&#x27;s novel. 

# The parody starts with &quot;It&#x27;s My Party and I&#x27;ll Snub Who I Want To&quot;, mocking the opening of I:1 &quot;A Long-expected Party&quot; and Bilbo&#x27;s leaving party. The Boggies are excited at the prospect of free food, especially the drooling and senile Haf Gangree, who has retired on the takings from his thriving blackmail business.
# &quot;Three&#x27;s Company, Four&#x27;s a Bore&quot; parodies I:3 &quot;Three is Company&quot;. Goodgulf Grayteeth (Gandalf) translates the writing on the Ring, beginning &quot;&#x27;This Ring, no other, is made by the elves, / Who&#x27;d pawn their own mother to grab it themselves.&#x27; &#x27;Shakestoor, it isn&#x27;t, said Frito&#x27;&quot;. 
# &quot;Indigestion at the Sign of the Goode Eats&quot; derides I:9 &quot;At the Sign of the Prancing Pony&quot; in the village of Whee in Wheeland, &quot;a small and swampy region populated mostly by star-nosed moles&quot;.
# &quot;Finders Keepers, Finders Weepers&quot; is a parody of II:1 &quot;Many Meetings&quot; and II:2 &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot;. Orlon (Elrond) and the Lady Lycra sit at the head of the table in dazzling whiteness: &quot;Dead they looked, and yet it was not so&quot;. An ancient lament of the Auld Elves runs &quot;A Unicef clearasil / Gibberish &#x27;n&#x27; drivel ... Sing hey nonny nembutal&quot;, mocking the Sindarin hymn &quot;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&quot;.
# &quot;Some Monsters&quot; echoes II:3 &quot;A Journey in the Dark&quot; and II:5 &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot;. In a parody of the Fellowship&#x27;s encounter with the Watcher in the Water, the chapter includes: &quot;&#x27;Aiyee!&#x27; shouted Legolam (Legolas). &#x27;A Thesaurus!&#x27; &#x27;Maim!&#x27; roared the monster. &#x27;Mutilate, mangle, crush. See HARM.&#x27;&quot; They enter the dread Andrea Doria (Moria), and fight the ballhog (Balrog). &quot;&#x27;Dulce et decorum&#x27;, said Bromosel (Boromir), hacking at the bridge.&quot; Goodgulf dies. The chapter continues with a parody of II:6 &quot;Lothlórien&quot;. They meet Lord Cellophane and Lady Lavalier of Lornadoon, land of the Gone Elves (Celeborn and Galadriel). &quot;&#x27;You have much to fear&#x27;, said Cellophane. &#x27;You leave at dawn&#x27;, said Lavalier.&quot; The travellers are given magic cloaks &quot;that blended in with any background, either green grass, green trees, green rocks, or green sky&quot;. Spam (Sam Gamgee) gets a gift of insect repellent.
#&quot;The Riders of Roi-Tan&quot; parodies III:2 &quot;The Riders of Rohan&quot;. &quot;Vere ist you going und vat are you doing here&quot; asks the leading Rider from the back of her bull merino sheep. The text continues, mocking III:3 &quot;The Uruk-Hai&quot;; &quot;&#x27;Okay, okay&#x27;, sobbed Pepsi. &#x27;Untie me and I&#x27;ll draw you a map.&#x27; Goulash (Grishnakh) agreed to this in his greedy haste...&quot; Pepsi and Moxie escape into the forest, for III:4 &quot;Treebeard&quot;, where they meet the terrifying Birdseye, Lord of the Vee-Ates, the jolly green giant, who makes puns about vegetables (&quot;lettuce&quot; go...). Meanwhile, echoing III:5 &quot;The White Rider&quot;, Arrowroot, Legolam, and Gimlet (Gimli) meet the reborn Goodgulf who is wearing new clothes from a boutique in Lornadoon (Lothlórien).
# &quot;Serutan Spelled Backwards is Mud&quot; parodies chapters including III:7 &quot;Helm&#x27;s Deep&quot; and III:10 &quot;The Voice of Saruman&quot;. The travellers &quot;stare with apprehension at the motionless wheels and tarpaulined exhibits&quot; of the fairground of Serutanland. Birdseye and his vegetables arrive and bombard Serutan&#x27;s fortress with giant suicide scallions and kamikaze kumquats. &quot;The ramparts were littered with chopped parsley, diced onion, and grated carrots.&quot; 
# &quot;Schlob&#x27;s Lair and Other Mountain Resorts&quot; mocks much of Book IV as Frito and Spam meet Goddam, cross the &quot;mucky pools&quot; of the Ngaio Marsh (the Dead Marshes), pass the black chimneys of Chikken Noodul (Minas Morgul), &quot;the dread company town that stood across from Minas Troney&quot;, and climb the Sol Hurok, the great cliffs of Fordor (Mordor). They enter Schlob&#x27;s (Shelob the giant spider&#x27;s) lair. Frito slashes at Schlob&#x27;s &quot;sharp red fingernails&quot; with his sword Tweezer, &quot;only managing to chip the enamel&quot;. &quot;As the ravenous creature closed in, Frito&#x27;s last memory was of Spam frantically schpritzing insect repellent into Schlob&#x27;s bottomless gullet&quot;.
# &quot;Minas Troney in the Soup&quot; parodies V:4 &quot;The Siege of Gondor&quot; and V:6 &quot;The Battle of the Pelennor Fields&quot;. The boggies are dressed in armour; Goodgulf &quot;wore only an old deep-sea diver&#x27;s suit of stoutest latex. ... In his hand he carried an ancient and trusty weapon, called by the elves a Browning semi-automatic&quot;.
# &quot;Be it Ever so Horrid&quot; briefly mocks Frodo&#x27;s homecoming, ignoring the tales of VI:8 &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; and VI:9 &quot;The Grey Havens&quot;: &quot;he walked directly to his cozy fire and slumped in the chair. He began to muse upon the years of delicious boredom that lay ahead. Perhaps he would take up Scrabble&quot;.

=== Other materials ===

Aside from the main text, the book includes:

* Inside cover reviews from a variety of supposed sources such as &quot;This book ... tremor ... Manichean guilt ... existential ... pleonastic ... redundancy ...&quot; by a Mr Orlando di Biscuit of the publication &quot;Hobnob&quot;, and concluding with a quotation by a Professor Hawley Smoot in the publication &quot;Our Loosely Enforced Libel Laws&quot;.
* A list of other books in the Matzoh &quot;series&quot; including &quot;The Matzoh of Casterbridge&quot; and &quot;Matzoh Dick&quot;, with the rider &quot;Unfortunately all of these books have been completely sold out&quot;.
* A double-page map by William S. Donnell, with places such as &quot;The Square Valley Between the Mounts&quot;, &quot;The Intermittent Mountains&quot;, the lands of &quot;Fördør&quot; and &quot;Gönad&quot;, &quot;The Big Wide River&quot;, &quot;The Legendary Drillingrigs&quot;, and the &quot;Lümbar&quot; region. 
* A text that purports to be a salacious sample from the book, in which an elf-maiden sets about seducing Frito to get the Ring.
* A &quot;Foreword&quot; and &quot;Prologue&quot; that mock the equivalent sections in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.
* A laudatory back cover review, written at Harvard, possibly by the authors themselves.

== Reception ==

The Tolkien scholar David Bratman, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, quotes an extended passage from the book in which Frito, Spam Gangree (Sam Gamgee), and Goddam jostle on the edge of the &quot;Black Hole&quot; (a tar pit), commenting &quot;Those parodists wrought better than they knew&quot;. He explains that Tolkien, in his many drafts, came very close to &quot;inadvertently writing the parody version of his own novel&quot;, though in the end he managed to avoid that, in Bratman&#x27;s view, remarkably completely.

The author Mike Sacks, quoting the book&#x27;s opening lines, writes that the book has had the distinction, rare for a parody, of being continuously in print for over 40 years, was one of the earliest parodies of &quot;a modern, popular bestseller&quot;, and has inspired many pop culture writers including those who worked on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;The Onion&quot;.

Leah Schnelbach, on the science fiction and fantasy site Tor.com, writes that the book is full of &quot;interesting comedic thoughts ... stuffed in under all the silliness&quot;. In her view, it takes &quot;an easy, marketable hook&quot; and creates &quot;a cutting satire of shallow consumerism and the good-old-fashioned American road trip&quot;. She remarks, too, on the rescue of the Boggies Frito and Spam by the eagle Gwahno. The eagle &quot;is efficient to the point of rudeness, yelling at them to fasten their seatbelts, snapping at them to use the barf bags if necessary, and complaining about running behind schedule: he&#x27;s the encapsulation of everything wrong with air travel&quot;. Schnelbach writes that after a picaresque journey through American kitsch, &quot;they end firmly in the angry, efficiency-at-all-costs Jet Age. And thus this ridiculous parody becomes a commentary on the perils of modernism, just like &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; itself.&quot;

== Artwork ==

The Signet first edition cover, a parody of the 1965 Ballantine paperback covers by Barbara Remington, was drawn by Muppets designer Michael K. Frith. Current editions have different artwork by Douglas Carrel, since the paperback cover art for &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; prevalent in the 1960s, then famous, is now obscure. William S. Donnell drew the &quot;parody map&quot; of Lower Middle Earth.

== Derivative works ==

Delta 4&#x27;s &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; is a 1985 text adventure game inspired by the book, but it was not directly based on it.

In 2013, an audio version was produced by Orion Audiobooks, narrated by Rupert Degas.

== Translations ==
The book has been translated into several languages, often with a title that puns on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;:

== In the media ==
The book is featured in the film &quot;A Futile and Stupid Gesture&quot;, which follows the times of its authors at &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&quot;.

== See also ==

<text>The Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s. The phenomenon was caused by a combination of natural factors (severe drought) and human-made factors: a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion, most notably the destruction of the natural topsoil by settlers in the region. The drought came in three waves: 1934, 1936, and 1939–1940, but some regions of the High Plains experienced drought conditions for as long as eight years. It exacerbated an already existing agricultural recession.

The Dust Bowl has been the subject of many cultural works, including John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, the folk music of Woody Guthrie, and Dorothea Lange&#x27;s photographs depicting the conditions of migrants, particularly &quot;Migrant Mother&quot;, taken in 1936.

==Geographic characteristics and early history==


The Dust Bowl area lies principally west of the 100th meridian on the High Plains, characterized by plains that vary from rolling in the north to flat in the Llano Estacado. Elevation ranges from in the east to at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The area is semiarid, receiving less than of rain annually; this rainfall supports the shortgrass prairie biome originally present in the area. The region is also prone to extended drought, alternating with unusual wetness of equivalent duration. During wet years, the rich soil provides bountiful agricultural output, but crops fail during dry years. The region is also subject to high winds. During early European and American exploration of the Great Plains, this region was thought unsuitable for European-style agriculture; explorers called it the Great American Desert. The lack of surface water and timber made the region less attractive than other areas for pioneer settlement and agriculture.

The federal government encouraged settlement and development of the Plains for agriculture via the Homestead Act of 1862, offering settlers &quot;quarter section&quot; plots. With the end of the Civil War in 1865 and the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869, waves of new migrants and immigrants reached the Great Plains and greatly increased the acreage under cultivation. An unusually wet period in the Great Plains mistakenly led settlers and the federal government to believe that &quot;rain follows the plow&quot; (a popular phrase among real estate promoters) and that the region&#x27;s climate had permanently changed. While initial agricultural endeavors were primarily cattle ranching, the harsh winters&#x27; adverse effect on the cattle, beginning in 1886, a short drought in 1890, and general overgrazing, led many landowners to increase the amount of land under cultivation.

Recognizing the challenge of cultivating marginal arid land, the U.S. government expanded on the offered under the Homestead Act, granting to homesteaders in western Nebraska under the Kinkaid Act (1904) and elsewhere in the Great Plains under the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909. Waves of European settlers arrived in the plains at the beginning of the 20th century. A return of unusually wet weather seemingly confirmed a previously held opinion that the &quot;formerly&quot; semiarid area could support large-scale agriculture. At the same time, technological improvements such as mechanized plowing and mechanized harvesting made it possible to operate larger properties without increasing labor costs.

With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the Great Plains&#x27; virgin topsoil during the previous decade; this displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds. The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small gasoline tractors, and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers&#x27; decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland. During the drought of the 1930s, the unanchored soil turned to dust, which prevailing winds blew away in huge clouds that sometimes blackened the sky. These choking billows of dustnamed &quot;black blizzards&quot; or &quot;black rollers&quot;traveled cross-country, reaching as far as the East Coast and striking such cities as New York City and Washington, D.C. On the plains, they often reduced visibility to or less. Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma, to witness the &quot;Black Sunday&quot; black blizzards of April 14, 1935; Edward Stanley, the Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press, coined the term &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; while rewriting Geiger&#x27;s news story.

The term &quot;the Dust Bowl&quot; originally referred to the geographical area affected by the dust, but today it usually refers to the event itself (the term &quot;Dirty Thirties&quot; is also sometimes used). The drought and erosion of the Dust Bowl affected that centered on the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Panhandle and touched adjacent sections of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas. The Dust Bowl forced tens of thousands of poverty-stricken families, who were unable to pay mortgages or grow crops, to abandon their farms, and losses reached $25 million per day by 1936 (equivalent to $ million in ). Many of these families, often called &quot;Okies&quot; because many of them came from Oklahoma, migrated to California and other states to find that the Great Depression had rendered economic conditions there little better than those they had left.

The combined effects of World War I and the disruption of the Russian Revolution, which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation. For example, in the Llano Estacado of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas, the area of farmland doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled between 1925 and 1930. The agricultural methods farmers favored during this period created the conditions for large-scale erosion under certain environmental conditions. The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses that held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods. Furthermore, cotton farmers left fields bare during the winter, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and burned the stubble as a means to control weeds before planting, thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.

==Drought and dust storms==

After fairly favorable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters, which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era in the summer of 1930. During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its 12 driest, and the entire region south to West Texas lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941. When severe drought struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices at the time. The drought dried the topsoil and over time it became friable, reduced to a powdery consistency in some places. Without indigenous grasses in place, the plains&#x27; high winds picked up the topsoil and created massive dust storms. The persistent dry weather caused crops to fail, leaving the plowed fields exposed to wind erosion. The Great Plains&#x27; fine soil eroded easily and was carried east by strong continental winds.

The first recorded dust storm occurred on September 14, 1930. It was seen more as a meteorological anomaly at the time as it was unlike anything else ever recorded. Unlike a sand storm, the cloud was black or gray (not beige or red) and rolled across the ground. Inside, visibility dropped to the point where people couldn&#x27;t see their hand in front of their face. It also generated a tremendous amount of static electricity, enough to short a car or knock someone out if they shook someone else&#x27;s hand.

On November 11, 1933, a very strong dust storm stripped topsoil from desiccated South Dakota farmlands in one of a series of severe dust storms that year. Beginning on May 9, 1934, a strong, two-day dust storm removed massive amounts of Great Plains topsoil in one of the worst such storms of the Dust Bowl. The dust clouds blew all the way to Chicago, where they deposited of dust. Two days later, the same storm reached cities to the east, such as Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Monuments like the Statue of Liberty and the United States Capitol were blotted out. Dust worked its way into even the most sealed homes, leaving a coating on food, skin, and furniture. That winter (1934–35), red snow fell on New England.

On April 14, 1935, known as &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, the day started out clear and warm, with temperatures in the 80&#x27;s and wind completely still, causing many people to let down their guard. However, a diving cold front from Canada kicked up mountains of dust in the turbulent air in the Dakotas and plowed south across the Great Plains at 60 mph. Before the line, it would still be very still with the only sign of the advancing storm being the snapping of static electricity and the screeching of flocks of birds and rabbits streaming south. The storm caught many people off guard as unlike every other storm, the winds didn&#x27;t pick up until the leading edge arrived. Once inside, the temperature plummeted by 30 degrees and the winds immediately increased to 60 mph. The dust fell straight down instead of sideways like the others and was also so dense that there was practically no visibility and one couldn&#x27;t even light a lamp as there wasn&#x27;t enough oxygen in the storm to keep it going. Denver-based Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma, that day. His story about Black Sunday marked the first appearance of the term &quot;Dust Bowl&quot;; it was coined by Edward Stanley, Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press, while rewriting Geiger&#x27;s news story.

Much of the farmland was eroded in the aftermath of the Dust Bowl. In 1941, a Kansas agricultural experiment station released a bulletin that suggested reestablishing native grasses by the &quot;hay method&quot;. Developed in 1937 to speed up the process and increase returns from pasture, the &quot;hay method&quot; was originally supposed to occur in Kansas naturally over 25–40 years.

After much data analysis, the causal mechanism for the droughts can be linked to ocean temperature anomalies. Specifically, Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures appear to have had an indirect effect on the general atmospheric circulation, while Pacific sea surface temperatures seem to have had the most direct influence.

==Human displacement==
This catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region.

In 1935, many families were forced to leave their farms and travel to other areas seeking work because of the drought, which had already lasted four years. The abandonment of homesteads and financial ruin resulting from catastrophic topsoil loss led to widespread hunger and poverty. Dust Bowl conditions fomented an exodus of the displaced from the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma Panhandle, and the surrounding Great Plains to adjacent regions. More than 500,000 Americans were left homeless. More than 350 houses had to be torn down after one storm alone. The severe drought and dust storms left many homeless; others had their mortgages foreclosed by banks, or felt they had no choice but to abandon their farms in search of work. Many Americans migrated west, looking for work. Parents packed up &quot;jalopies&quot; with their families and a few personal belongings and headed west. Some residents of the Plains, especially Kansas and Oklahoma, fell ill and died of dust pneumonia or malnutrition.

Between 1930 and 1940, about 3.5 million people moved out of the Plains states. In just over a year, over 86,000 people migrated to California. This number is more than the number of migrants to that area during the 1849 gold rush. Migrants abandoned farms in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico, but were often generally called &quot;Okies&quot;, &quot;Arkies&quot;, or &quot;Texies&quot;. Terms such as &quot;Okies&quot; and &quot;Arkies&quot; came to be standard in the 1930s for those who had lost everything and were struggling the most during the Great Depression.

But not all migrants traveled long distances; most participated in internal state migration, moving from counties that the Dust Bowl badly impacted to other, less affected counties. So many families left their farms and were on the move that the proportion of migrants and residents was nearly equal in the Great Plains states.

An examination of Census Bureau statistics and other records, and a 1939 survey of occupation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of about 116,000 families who arrived in California in the 1930s, showed that only 43% of Southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated. Nearly a third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers. Some farmers had to take on unskilled labor when they moved; leaving the farming sector commonly led to greater social mobility as there was a far greater likelihood that migrant farmers would later go into semi-skilled or high-skilled fields that paid better. Non-farmers experienced more downward occupational moves than farmers, but in most cases they were not significant enough to bring them into poverty, because high-skilled migrants were most likely to experience a downward shift into semi-skilled work. While semi-skilled work did not pay as well as high-skilled work, most of these workers were not impoverished. For the most part, by the end of the Dust Bowl the migrants generally were better off than those who chose to stay behind.

After the Great Depression ended, some migrants moved back to their original states. Many others remained where they had resettled. About one-eighth of California&#x27;s population is of Okie heritage.

== Changes in agriculture and population on the Plains ==

Agricultural land and revenue boomed during World War I, but fell during the Great Depression and the 1930s. The agricultural land most affected by the Dust Bowl was of land in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. These 20 counties that the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Soil Conservation Service identified as the worst wind-eroded region were home to the majority of the Great Plains migrants during the Dust Bowl.

While migration from and between the Southern Great Plain States was greater than migration in other regions in the 1930s, the numbers of migrants from these areas had only slightly increased from the 1920s. The Dust Bowl and Great Depression thus did not trigger a mass exodus of southern migrants, but simply encouraged these migrants to keep moving where in other areas the Great Depression limited mobility due to economic issues, decreasing migration. While the population of the Great Plains did fall during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, the drop was not caused by extreme numbers of migrants leaving the Great Plains but by of a lack of migrants moving from outside the Great Plains into the region.

== Government response ==

Government&#x27;s greatly expanded participation in land management and soil conservation was an important result of the disaster. Different groups took many different approaches to responding to the disaster. To identify areas that needed attention, groups such as the Soil Conservation Service generated detailed soil maps and took photos of the land from the sky. To create shelterbelts to reduce soil erosion, groups such as the United States Forest Service&#x27;s Prairie States Forestry Project planted trees on private lands. Groups like the Resettlement Administration, which later became the Farm Security Administration, encouraged small farm owners to resettle on other lands if they lived in drier parts of the Plains.

During President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s first 100 days in office in 1933, his administration quickly initiated programs to conserve soil and restore the nation&#x27;s ecological balance. Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes established the Soil Erosion Service in August 1933 under Hugh Hammond Bennett. In 1935, it was transferred and reorganized under the Department of Agriculture and renamed the Soil Conservation Service. It is now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).

As part of New Deal programs, Congress passed the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act in 1936, requiring landowners to share the allocated government subsidies with the laborers who worked on their farms. Under the law, &quot;benefit payments were continued as measures for production control and income support, but they were now financed by direct Congressional appropriations and justified as soil conservation measures. The Act shifted the parity goal from price equality of agricultural commodities and the articles that farmers buy to income equality of farm and non-farm population.&quot; Thus, the parity goal was to re-create the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms from agriculture and that of the income of persons not on farms that prevailed during 1909–1914.

To stabilize prices, the government paid farmers and ordered more than six million pigs to be slaughtered as part of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). It paid to have the meat packed and distributed to the poor and hungry. The Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) was established to regulate crop and other surpluses. In a May 14, 1935, address to the AAA, Roosevelt said:

Let me make one other point clear for the benefit of the millions in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our programwe can prove itsaved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat.

The FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations. Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels. Cotton goods were later included, to clothe needy.

In 1935, the federal government formed a Drought Relief Service (DRS) to coordinate relief activities. The DRS bought cattle in counties that were designated emergency areas for $14 to $20 a head. Animals determined unfit for human consumption were killed; at the beginning of the program, more than 50% were so designated in emergency areas. The DRS assigned the remaining cattle to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide. Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. &quot;The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets.&quot;

Roosevelt ordered the Civilian Conservation Corps to plant the Great Plains Shelterbelt, a huge belt of more than 200 million trees from Canada to Abilene, Texas, to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil in place. The administration also began to educate farmers on soil conservation and anti-erosion techniques, including crop rotation, strip farming, contour plowing, and terracing. In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage Dust Bowl farmers to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil. The government paid reluctant farmers a dollar an acre () to use the new methods. By 1938, the massive conservation effort had reduced the amount of blowing soil by 65%. The land still failed to yield a decent living. In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended when regular rainfall finally returned to the region. The government still encouraged continuing the use of conservation methods to protect the Plains&#x27; soil and ecology.

At the end of the drought, the programs implemented during the tough times helped sustain a friendly relationship between farmers and the federal government.

The President&#x27;s Drought Committee issued a report in 1935 covering the government&#x27;s assistance to agriculture during 1934 through mid-1935: it discussed conditions, measures of relief, organization, finances, operations, and results of the government&#x27;s assistance. Numerous exhibits are included in this report.

==Long-term economic impact==
In many regions, more than 75% of the topsoil was blown away by the end of the 1930s. Land degradation varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences of erosion, the Dust Bowl had severe long-term economic consequences.

By 1940, counties that had experienced the most erosion had a greater decline in agricultural land values. The per-acre value of farmland declined by 28% in high-erosion counties and 17% in medium-erosion counties, relative to land value changes in low-erosion counties. Even over the long term, the land&#x27;s agricultural value often failed to return to pre-Dust Bowl levels. In highly eroded areas, less than 25% of the original agricultural losses were recovered. The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s.

The economic effects persisted in part because of farmers&#x27; failure to switch to more appropriate crops for highly eroded areas. Because the amount of topsoil had been reduced, it would have been more productive to shift from crops and wheat to animals and hay. During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became less productive in more-eroded counties.

Some of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use. A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states. Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to obtain capital to shift crop production. In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers at first had little incentive to change their crops.

Patrick Allitt recounts how fellow historian Donald Worster responded to his return visit to the Dust Bowl in the mid-1970s when he revisited some of the worst afflicted counties:
:Capital-intensive agribusiness had transformed the scene; deep wells into the aquifer, intensive irrigation, the use of artificial pesticides and fertilizers, and giant harvesters were creating immense crops year after year whether it rained or not. According to the farmers he interviewed, technology had provided the perfect answer to old troubles, such of the bad days would not return. In Worster&#x27;s view, by contrast, the scene demonstrated that America&#x27;s capitalist high-tech farmers had learned nothing. They were continuing to work in an unsustainable way, devoting far cheaper subsidized energy to growing food than the energy could give back to its ultimate consumers.

In contrast with Worster&#x27;s pessimism, historian Mathew Bonnifield argued that the Dust Bowl&#x27;s long-term significance was &quot;the triumph of the human spirit in its capacity to endure and overcome hardships and reverses.&quot;

A 2023 study in the &quot;Journal of Economic History&quot; found that while the Dust Bowl had large and enduring impacts on agricultural land, it had modest impacts on average wage incomes.

==Influence on the arts and culture==
The crisis was documented by photographers, musicians, and authors, many hired during the Great Depression by the federal government. For instance, the Farm Security Administration hired photographers to document the crisis. Artists such as Dorothea Lange were aided by having salaried work during the Depression. She captured what have become classic images of the dust storms and migrant families. Among her best-known photographs is &quot;Destitute Pea Pickers in California. Mother of Seven Children&quot; depicted a gaunt-looking woman, Florence Owens Thompson, holding three of her children. This picture expressed the struggles of people caught by the Dust Bowl and raised awareness in other parts of the country of its reach and human cost. Decades later, Thompson disliked the boundless circulation of the photo and resented that she had received no money from its broadcast. Thompson felt it made her perceived as a Dust Bowl &quot;Okie&quot;.

The work of independent artists was also influenced by the crises of the Dust Bowl and the Depression. Author John Steinbeck, borrowing closely from field notes taken by Farm Security Administration worker and author Sanora Babb, wrote &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939) about migrant workers and farm families displaced by the Dust Bowl. Babb&#x27;s own novel about the lives of the migrant workers, &quot;Whose Names Are Unknown&quot;, was written in 1939, but was eclipsed and shelved in response to Steinbeck&#x27;s success, and was not published till 2004. Many of folk singer Woody Guthrie&#x27;s songs, such as those on his 1940 album &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot;, are about his experiences in the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression, when he traveled with displaced farmers from Oklahoma to California and learned their traditional folk and blues songs, earning him the nickname the &quot;Dust Bowl Troubadour&quot;.

Migrants also influenced musical culture wherever they went. Oklahoma migrants, in particular, were rural Southwesterners who carried their traditional country music to California. Today, the &quot;Bakersfield Sound&quot; describes this blend, which developed after the migrants brought country music to the city. Their new music inspired a proliferation of country dance halls as far south as Los Angeles.

The 2003–2005 HBO TV series &quot;Carnivàle&quot; was set during the Dust Bowl period.

The 2014 science fiction film &quot;Interstellar&quot; features a ravaged 21st-century America that is again scoured by dust storms (caused by a worldwide pathogen affecting all crops). Along with inspiration from the 1930s crisis, director Christopher Nolan features interviews from the 2012 documentary &quot;The Dust Bowl&quot; to draw further parallels.

In 2017, Americana recording artist Grant Maloy Smith released the album &quot;Dust Bowl – American Stories&quot;, inspired by the history of the Dust Bowl. In a review, the music magazine &quot;No Depression&quot; wrote that the album&#x27;s lyrics and music are &quot;as potent as Woody Guthrie, as intense as John Trudell and dusted with the trials and tribulations of Tom JoadSteinbeck and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.&quot;

<text>Darryl Andrew Kile (December 2, 1968 – June 22, 2002) was an American professional baseball starting pitcher. He pitched from 1991 to 2002 for three Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, primarily for the Houston Astros. Kile was known for his sharp, big-breaking curveball. He died at the age of 33 of coronary artery disease in 2002 in Chicago, where he and the St. Louis Cardinals were staying for a weekend series against the Chicago Cubs. He was the first active major league player to die during the regular season since 1979, when the New York Yankees&#x27; Thurman Munson died in a plane crash.

== Early life ==
Kile was born on December 2, 1968, in Garden Grove, California, near Angel Stadium. He attended Norco High School in Norco, California, where his awkward frame and low pitch velocity — his four-seam fastball topping out at — meant that he was mostly overlooked by college recruiters and scouts. In 1987, after graduating from Norco, Kile enrolled at Chaffey Junior College in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and joined their college baseball team as a walk-on. Between his freshman and sophomore year of college, Kile underwent a growth spurt that took him from to , helped him gain , and added to his fastball.

===Houston Astros===
Kile was selected by the Houston Astros in the 30th round of the 1987 Major League draft. Having been successful with the Tucson Toros, the Astros&#x27; AAA club in the Pacific Coast League, Kile entered the majors in 1991, going 7–11 in 22 starts. In his first major league start on April 24, 1991, Kile had a no-hitter going when he was lifted after six innings by manager Art Howe, who wanted to protect the 22-year-old rookie&#x27;s arm. Kile&#x27;s breakthrough year came in 1993 when he went 15–8 with a 3.51 earned run average and made the All-Star team. On September 8, Kile pitched a no-hitter against the New York Mets. He pitched seven seasons with the Astros, mostly as a starter. Another strong season was 1997, when he went 19–7, compiled a 2.57 ERA, made the All-Star team again, threw a career-high innings, and pitched four shutouts. He finished fifth in voting for the NL Cy Young Award. Kile made his first postseason appearance in Game 1 of the 1997 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, giving up only two hits but suffering a hard-luck 2–1 loss. Atlanta swept Houston in the best-of-five series.

===Colorado Rockies and St. Louis Cardinals===
In 1998, Kile signed with the Colorado Rockies as a free agent. Kile suffered control problems, allowing hitters to lay off his curveball. After two seasons in which he was a combined 21–30 and posted ERAs of 5.20 and 6.61, Kile was traded to the Cardinals. In his first season with St. Louis, Kile went 20–9, becoming the first Cardinal pitcher since John Tudor and Joaquín Andújar in 1985 to win 20 games in a season. He made his third All-Star team and again finished fifth in NL Cy Young Award voting. He earned the first playoff victory of his career in Game 2 of the 2000 NLDS against Atlanta, but suffered two losses in the NL Championship Series, which the Cardinals lost to the Mets in five games.

Kile went 16–11 in 2001, and the Cardinals made the playoffs again, losing to the eventual world champion Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS. Kile was the starting pitcher for Game 3 and received a no-decision. Kile threw innings and compiled a 3.09 ERA that season, despite having an injured shoulder which required surgery after the Cardinals were eliminated from the playoffs. He spent the offseason rehabilitating and was ready for the start of the 2002 season. In 12 seasons as a major league pitcher, Kile never went on the disabled list.

On June 18, Kile pitched in an interleague game against the Anaheim Angels, scattering six hits over innings, allowing one run. He exited the game in the eighth inning to a standing ovation. Kile and the Cardinals won the game, 7–2, and moved into first place in the NL&#x27;s Central Division, a spot they held for the rest of the 2002 season.

== Personal life ==
Kile proposed to his wife, Flynn, in 1991, when they were both 22 years old. They were married on January 11, 1992, and had three children. He and his family lived in Clayton, Missouri, during the baseball season. The family also owned a home in Englewood, Colorado, where they lived during the offseason, though at the time of Kile&#x27;s death, the family was in the process of moving to San Diego for the offseasons.

== Death ==
On June 22, 2002, during pregame warmups for what would have been a day game in Chicago against the rival Cubs, team personnel noted Kile&#x27;s absence. Hotel staff entered his room and discovered him in his bed, under the covers, dead of a heart attack. His death, which came four days after that of longtime Cardinal broadcaster Jack Buck, was ruled to be from natural causes; an autopsy found that Kile had an enlarged heart, two of his coronary arteries were 90% blocked, and there was a blood clot in one artery. Kile&#x27;s father had died from a blood clot in 1993, aged 44.

Cubs catcher Joe Girardi announced at Wrigley Field that the afternoon&#x27;s game versus the Cardinals had been cancelled, though he did not give a specific reason. Girardi tearfully gave the news at 2:37 pm CDT, broadcast regionally on Fox: &quot;Excuse me. I thank you for your patience. We regret to inform you because of a tragedy in the Cardinal family, that the commissioner has cancelled the game today. Please be respectful. You will find out eventually what has happened, and I ask that you say a prayer for the Cardinals&#x27; family.&quot; The game was rescheduled and made up later in the year on August 31, a 10–4 Cardinal defeat. Jason Simontacchi, who pitched for the Cardinals, was visibly emotional during the game since Kile was a mentor to him. Later that season, when the Cardinals clinched the Central Division championship in a game against the Astros, teammate Albert Pujols carried Kile&#x27;s number 57 jersey, on a hanger, to the celebration on the field. 

===Memorial===

The Cardinals honored Kile by placing a small &quot;DK 57&quot; sign in the home bullpen. This sign was carried over to the new Busch Stadium and remains today. The team wrote &quot;DK 57&quot; on their hats. The team put chalk and markers in the Busch Stadium concourses so fans could write similar messages on their caps. In the All-Star Game, Cardinals pitcher Matt Morris wrote DK 57 on his hands and held them up when they announced his name in honor of his fallen teammate and close friend.

Since Kile&#x27;s death, the Astros have not assigned number 57 to another player. The Cardinals were the first of Kile&#x27;s former teams to re-issue the number, doing so in 2021, giving it to pitcher Zack Thompson during spring training. Thompson wore the number during his major league debut in 2022, nearly twenty full years after Kile&#x27;s death. The Rockies kept the number 57 out of the rotation until it was issued to Tommy Doyle in 2023. 

The Astros honored Kile with a memorial plaque that hangs along the left field wall at Minute Maid Park under the 1997 Central Division Championship banner, the last season Kile played for Houston before signing with Colorado. A &quot;DK 57&quot; sign currently sits among the wall in left-center field. The Rockies have a memorial near the bullpens. It is circular, says &quot;DK 57&quot;, and is on pinstripes.

In 2003, the Darryl Kile Good Guy Award was established and is presented annually to the Astros player and Cardinals player who best exemplify Kile&#x27;s traits of &quot;a good teammate, a great friend, a fine father and a humble man&quot;. The winners are selected, respectively, by the Houston and St. Louis chapters of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). The first recipients of the award were Jeff Bagwell and Mike Matheny of the Astros and Cardinals, respectively.

Kile was given an exemption by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America and placed on the ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003. With seven votes, he was eliminated from future BBWAA ballot consideration.

<text>The Group of Eight (G8) was an intergovernmental political forum from 1997–2014. It had formed from incorporating Russia into the G7, and returned to its previous name after Russia was expelled in 2014.

The forum originated with a 1975 summit hosted by France that brought together representatives of six governments: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, thus leading to the name Group of Six or G6. The summit came to be known as the Group of Seven in 1976 with the addition of Canada. Russia was added to the political forum from 1997, which the following year became known as the G8. In March 2014 Russia was suspended indefinitely following the annexation of Crimea, whereupon the political forum name reverted to G7. In January 2017, Russia announced its permanent withdrawal from the G8. However, several representatives of G7 countries stated that they would be interested in Russia&#x27;s return to the group. The European Union (or predecessor institutions) was represented at the G8 since the 1980s as a &quot;nonenumerated&quot; participant, but originally could not host or chair summits. The 40th summit was the first time the European Union was able to host and chair a summit. Collectively, in 2012 the G8 nations comprised 50.1 percent of 2012 global nominal GDP and 40.9 percent of global GDP (PPP). The G8 countries were not strictly the largest in the world nor the highest-income per capita, but they do represent the largest high-income countries.

&quot;G7&quot; can refer to the member states in aggregate or to the annual summit meeting of the G7 heads of government. G7 ministers also meet throughout the year, such as the G7 finance ministers (who meet four times a year), G7 foreign ministers, or G7 environment ministers.

Each calendar year, the responsibility of hosting the G8 was rotated through the member states in the following order: France, United States, United Kingdom, Russia (suspended), Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada. The holder of the presidency sets the agenda, hosts the summit for that year, and determines which ministerial meetings will take place.

In 2005, the UK government initiated the practice of inviting five leading emerging markets – Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa – to participate in the G8 meetings that came to be known as G8+5. With the G20 major economies growing in stature since the 2008 Washington summit, world leaders from the group announced at their Pittsburgh summit in September 2009 that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations. Nevertheless, the G7 retains its relevance as a &quot;steering group for the West&quot;, with special significance appointed to Japan.

== History ==
Following 1994&#x27;s G7 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7 after the group&#x27;s summits. This informal arrangement was dubbed the Political 8 (P8)—or, colloquially, the G7+1. At the invitation of UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, President Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, later as a full participant. It was seen as a way to encourage Yeltsin with his capitalist reforms. Russia formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight, or G8.

=== Focus of G8 ===
A major focus of the G8 since 2009 has been the global supply of food. At the 2009 L&#x27;Aquila summit, the G8&#x27;s members promised to contribute $22 billion to the issue. By 2015, 93% of funds had been disbursed to projects like sustainable agriculture development and adequate emergency food aid assistance.

At the 2012 summit, President Barack Obama asked G8 leaders to adopt the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition initiative to . Ghana became one of the first six African countries to sign up to the G8 New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in 2012. There was, however, almost no knowledge of the G8 initiative among some stakeholders, including farmers, academics and agricultural campaign groups. Confusion surrounding the plans was made worse, critics say, by &quot;a dizzying array of regional and national agriculture programmes that are inaccessible to ordinary people&quot;.

=== Russia&#x27;s participation suspension (2014) ===
On 24 March 2014, the G7 members cancelled the planned G8 summit that was to be held in June of that year in the Russian city of Sochi, and suspended Russia&#x27;s membership of the group, due to Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea; nevertheless, they stopped short of outright permanent expulsion. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov downplayed the importance of the decision by the U.S. and its allies, and pointed out that major international decisions were made by the G20 countries.

Later on, the Italian Foreign Affairs minister Federica Mogherini and other Italian authorities, along with the EastWest Institute board member Wolfgang Ischinger, suggested that Russia may restore its membership in the group. In April 2015, the German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that Russia would be welcomed to return to G8 provided the Minsk Protocol were implemented. In 2016, he added that &quot;none of the major international conflicts can be solved without Russia&quot;, and the G7 countries will consider Russia&#x27;s return to the group in 2017. The same year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe called for Russia&#x27;s return to G8, stating that Russia&#x27;s involvement is &quot;crucial to tackling multiple crises in the Middle East&quot;. In January 2017, the Italian foreign minister Angelino Alfano said that Italy hopes for &quot;resuming the G8 format with Russia and ending the atmosphere of the Cold War&quot;. On 13 January 2017, Russia announced that it would permanently leave the G8 grouping. Nonetheless, Christian Lindner, the leader of Free Democratic Party of Germany and member of the Bundestag, said that Putin should be &quot;asked to join the table of the G7&quot; so that one could &quot;talk with him and not about him&quot;, and &quot;we cannot make all things dependent on the situation in Crimea&quot;. In April 2018, the German politicians and members of the Bundestag Sahra Wagenknecht and Alexander Graf Lambsdorff said that Russia should be invited back to the group and attend the 2018 summit in Canada: &quot;Russia should again be at the table during the [June] summit at the latest&quot; because &quot;peace in Europe and also in the Middle East is only possible with Russia&quot;. The US President Donald Trump also stated that Russia should be reinstated to the group; his appeal was supported by the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. After several G7 members quickly rejected US President Trump&#x27;s suggestion to again accept the Russian Federation into the G8, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said that the Russian Federation wasn&#x27;t interested in rejoining the political forum. He also said that the G20 is sufficient for the Russian Federation. In the final statement of the 2018 meeting in Canada, the G7 members announced to continue sanctions and also to be ready to take further restrictive measures against the Russian Federation for the failure of Minsk Agreement complete implementation.

=== A &quot;new G8&quot; ===
On 11 June 2022, Vyacheslav Volodin, the current Chairman of the State Duma, announced on Telegram that &quot;countries wishing to build an equal dialogue and mutually beneficial relations would actually form, together with Russia, a &#x27;new G8. Although Volodin mentioned the group of eight countries not participating in the sanctions against the Russian Federation—China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Iran, and Turkey—there have been no updates regarding the new G8; however, four of the seven nations listed are already a part of, or are expected to join in 2024, BRICS.

== Structure and activities ==

By design, the G8 deliberately lacked an administrative structure like those for international organizations, such as the United Nations or the World Bank. The group does not have a permanent secretariat, or offices for its members.

The presidency of the group rotates annually among member countries, with each new term beginning on 1 January of the year. The rotation order is: France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia (suspended), Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada. The country holding the presidency is responsible for planning and hosting a series of ministerial-level meetings, leading up to a mid-year summit attended by the heads of government. The president of the European Commission participates as an equal in all summit events.

The ministerial meetings bring together ministers responsible for various portfolios to discuss issues of mutual or global concern. The range of topics include health, law enforcement, labor, economic and social development, energy, environment, foreign affairs, justice and interior, terrorism, and trade. There are also a separate set of meetings known as the G8+5, created during the 2005 Gleneagles, Scotland summit, that is attended by finance and energy ministers from all eight member countries in addition to the five &quot;outreach countries&quot; which are also known as the Group of Five—Brazil, People&#x27;s Republic of China, India, Mexico, and South Africa.

In June 2005, justice ministers and interior ministers from the G8 countries agreed to launch an international database on pedophiles. The G8 officials also agreed to pool data on terrorism, subject to restrictions by privacy and security laws in individual countries.

=== Global energy ===

At the Heiligendamm Summit in 2007, the G8 acknowledged a proposal from the EU for a worldwide initiative on efficient energy use. They agreed to explore, along with the International Energy Agency, the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 along with China, India, South Korea and the European Community established the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation, at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan holding 2008 G8 Presidency, in Aomori.

G8 Finance Ministers, whilst in preparation for the 34th Summit of the G8 Heads of State and Government in Toyako, Hokkaido, met on the 13 and 14 June 2008, in Osaka, Japan. They agreed to the &quot;G8 Action Plan for Climate Change to Enhance the Engagement of Private and Public Financial Institutions&quot;. In closing, Ministers supported the launch of new Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) by the World Bank, which will help existing efforts until a new framework under the UNFCCC is implemented after 2012. The UNFCCC is not on track to meeting any of its stated goals.

In July 2005, the G8 Summit endorsed the IPHE in its Plan of Action on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development, and identified it as a medium of cooperation and collaboration to develop clean energy technologies.

=== Annual summit ===
The first G8 summit was held in 1997 after Russia formally joined the G7 group, and the last one was held in 2013. The 2014 summit was scheduled to be held in Russia. However, due to Crimea&#x27;s annexation by the Russian Federation, the other seven countries decided to hold a separate meeting without Russia as a G7 summit in Brussels, Belgium.

== Criticism ==
One type of criticism is that members of G8 do not do enough to help global problems, due to strict patent policy and other issues related to globalization. In &quot;Unraveling Global Apartheid&quot;, political analyst Titus Alexander described the G7, as it was in 1996, as the &#x27;cabinet&#x27; of global minority rule, with a coordinating role in world affairs.

In 2012 The Heritage Foundation, an American conservative think tank, criticized the G8 for advocating food security without making room for economic freedom.

== Relevance ==
The G8&#x27;s relevance has been subject to debate from 2008 onward. It represented the major industrialized countries but critics argued that the G8 no longer represented the world&#x27;s most powerful economies, as China has surpassed every economy but the United States.

Vladimir Putin did not attend the 2012 G8 summit at Camp David, causing &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine to remark that the summit has generally outlived its usefulness as a viable international gathering of foreign leaders. Two years later, Russia was suspended from the G8, then chose to leave permanently in January 2017.

The G20 major economies leaders&#x27; summit has had an increased level of international prestige and influence. However, British Prime Minister David Cameron said of the G8 in 2012:

Some people ask, does the G8 still matter, when we have a Group of 20? My answer is, yes. The G8 is a group of like-minded countries that share a belief in free enterprise as the best route to growth. As eight countries making up about half the world&#x27;s gross domestic product, the standards we set, the commitments we make, and the steps we take can help solve vital global issues, fire up economies and drive prosperity all over the world.

== Youth 8 Summit ==
The Y8 Summit or simply Y8, formerly known as the G8 Youth Summit is the youth counterpart to the G8 summit. The summits were organized from 2006 to 2013. The first summit to use the name Y8 took place in May 2012 in Puebla, Mexico, alongside the Youth G8 that took place in Washington, D.C. the same year. From 2016 onwards, similar youth conferences were organized under the name Y7 Summit.

The Y8 Summit brings together young leaders from G8 nations and the European Union to facilitate discussions of international affairs, promote cross-cultural understanding, and build global friendships. The conference closely follows the formal negotiation procedures of the G8 Summit. The Y8 Summit represents the innovative voice of young adults between the age of 18 and 35. At the end of the summit, the delegates jointly come up with a consensus-based written statement, the Final Communiqué. This document is subsequently presented to G8 leaders in order to inspire positive change.

The Y8 Summit was organized annually by a global network of youth-led organizations called The IDEA (The International Diplomatic Engagement Association). The organizations undertake the selection processes for their respective national delegations, while the hosting country is responsible for organizing the summit. An example of such a youth-led organization is the Young European Leadership association, which recruits and sends EU Delegates.

The goal of the Y8 Summit is to bring together young people from around the world to allow the voices and opinions of young generations to be heard and to encourage them to take part in global decision-making processes.

<text>South Vietnam, officially the Republic of Vietnam (RVN; ; VNCH, ), was a country in Southeast Asia that existed from 1955 to 1975. It first garnered international recognition in 1949 as the State of Vietnam within the French Union, with its capital at Saigon (renamed to Ho Chi Minh City in 1976), before becoming a republic in 1955, the time when the southern portion of Vietnam was one member of the Western Bloc during part of the Cold War after the 1954 division of Vietnam. South Vietnam was bordered by North Vietnam (Democratic Republic of Vietnam) to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, and Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. Its sovereignty was recognized by the United States and 87 other nations, though it failed to gain admission into the United Nations as a result of a Soviet veto in 1957. It was succeeded by the Republic of South Vietnam in 1975. In 1976, the Republic of South Vietnam and North Vietnam merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

The end of the Second World War saw anti-Japanese Việt Minh guerrilla forces, led by communist fighter Ho Chi Minh, proclaiming the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi in September 1945. In 1949, during the First Indochina War, the French formed the State of Vietnam, a rival government of anti-communist Vietnamese politicians in Saigon, led by former emperor Bảo Đại. A 1955 referendum on the state&#x27;s future form of government was widely marred by electoral fraud and resulted in the deposal of Bảo Đại by Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm, who proclaimed himself president of the new republic on 26 October 1955. After the 1954 Geneva Conference, it abandoned its claims to the northern, Việt Minh-controlled part of the country, and established its sovereignty over the southern half of Vietnam consisting of Cochinchina (&quot;Nam Kỳ&quot;), a former French colony; and parts of Annam (&quot;Trung Kỳ&quot;), a former French protectorate. Diệm was killed in a CIA-backed military coup led by general Dương Văn Minh in 1963, and a series of short-lived military governments followed. General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu then led the country after a US-encouraged civilian presidential election from 1967 until 1975.

The beginnings of the Vietnam War occurred in 1955 with an uprising by the newly organized National Liberation Front for South Vietnam (Việt Cộng), armed and supported by North Vietnam, with backing mainly from China and the Soviet Union. Larger escalation of the insurgency occurred in 1965 with American intervention and the introduction of regular forces of Marines, followed by Army units to supplement the cadre of military advisors guiding the Southern armed forces. A regular bombing campaign over North Vietnam was conducted by offshore US Navy airplanes, warships, and aircraft carriers joined by Air Force squadrons through 1966 and 1967. Fighting peaked up to that point during the Tet Offensive of February 1968, when there were over a million South Vietnamese soldiers and 500,000 US soldiers in South Vietnam. What started as a guerrilla war eventually turned into a more conventional fight as the balance of power became equalized. An even larger, armored invasion from the North commenced during the Easter Offensive following US ground-forces withdrawal, and had nearly overrun some major southern cities until being beaten back.

Despite a truce agreement under the Paris Peace Accords, concluded in January 1973 after five years of on-and-off negotiations, fighting continued almost immediately afterwards. The regular North Vietnamese army and Việt-Cộng auxiliaries launched a major second combined-arms conventional invasion in 1975. Communist forces overran Saigon on 30 April 1975, marking the end of the Republic of Vietnam. On 2 July 1976, the North Vietnamese-controlled Republic of South Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

==Etymology==

The official name of the South Vietnamese state was the &quot;Republic of Vietnam&quot; (; ). The North was known as the &quot;Democratic Republic of Vietnam&quot;.

&quot;Việt Nam&quot; () was the name adopted by Emperor Gia Long in 1804. It is a variation of &quot;Nam Việt&quot; ( , &quot;Southern Việt&quot;), a name used in ancient times. In 1839, Emperor Minh Mạng renamed the country &quot;Đại Nam&quot; (&quot;Great South&quot;). In 1945, the nation&#x27;s official name was changed back to &quot;Vietnam&quot;. The name is also sometimes rendered as &quot;Viet Nam&quot; in English. The term &quot;South Vietnam&quot; became common usage in 1954, when the Geneva Conference provisionally partitioned Vietnam into communist and capitalist parts.

Other names of this state were commonly used during its existence such as &quot;Free Vietnam&quot; and the &quot;Government of Viet Nam&quot; (GVN).

==History==
===Founding of South Vietnam===
Before World War II, the southern third of Vietnam was the concession (nhượng địa) of Cochinchina, which was administered as part of French Indochina. A French governor-general (toàn quyền) in Hanoi administered all the five parts of Indochina (Tonkin, Annam, Cochinchina, Laos, and Cambodia) while Cochinchina (Nam Kỳ) was under a French governor (thống đốc), but the difference from the other parts with most indigenous intelligentsia and wealthy were naturalized French (Tourane now Đà Nẵng in the central third of Vietnam also enjoyed this privilege because this city was also a concession). The northern third of Vietnam (then the colony (thuộc địa) of Tonkin (Bắc Kỳ) was under a French resident general (thống sứ). Between Tonkin in the north and Cochinchina in the south was the protectorate (xứ bảo hộ) of Annam (Trung Kỳ), under a French resident superior (khâm sứ). A Vietnamese emperor, Bảo Đại, residing in Huế, was the nominal ruler of Annam and Tonkin, which had parallel French and Vietnamese systems of administration, but his influence was less in Tonkin than in Annam. Cochinchina had been annexed by France in 1862 and even elected a deputy to the French National Assembly. It was more &quot;evolved&quot;, and French interests were stronger than in other parts of Indochina, notably in the form of French-owned rubber plantations. During World War II, Indochina was administered by Vichy France and occupied by Japan in September 1940. Japanese troops overthrew the Vichy administration on 9 March 1945, Emperor Bảo Đại proclaimed Vietnam independent. When the Japanese surrendered on 16 August 1945, Emperor Bảo Đại abdicated, and Việt Minh leader Hồ Chí Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in Hanoi and the DRV controlled almost the entire country of Vietnam. In June 1946, France declared Cochinchina a republic, separate from the northern and central parts. A Chinese Kuomintang army arrived to occupy Vietnam&#x27;s north of the 16th parallel north, while a British-led force occupied the south in September. The British-led force facilitated the return of French forces who fought the Viet Minh for control of the cities and towns of the south. The French Indochina War began on 19 December 1946, with the French regaining control of Hanoi and many other cities.

The State of Vietnam was created through co-operation between anti-communist Vietnamese and the French government on 14 June 1949. Former emperor Bảo Đại accepted the position of chief of state (&quot;quốc trưởng&quot;). This was known as the &quot;Bảo Đại Solution&quot;. The colonial struggle in Vietnam became part of the global Cold War. In 1950, China, the Soviet Union and other communist nations recognised the DRV while the United States and other non-communist states recognised the Bảo Đại government.

In July 1954, France and the Việt Minh agreed at the Geneva Conference that the Vietnam would be temporarily divided at 17th parallel north and State of Vietnam would rule the territory south of the 17th parallel, pending unification on the basis of supervised elections in 1956. At the time of the conference, it was expected that the South would continue to be a French dependency. However, South Vietnamese Premier Ngô Đình Diệm, who preferred American sponsorship to French, rejected the agreement. When Vietnam was divided, 800,000 to 1 million North Vietnamese, mainly (but not exclusively) Roman Catholics, sailed south as part of Operation Passage to Freedom due to a fear of religious persecution in the North. About 90,000 Việt Minh were evacuated to the North while 5,000 to 10,000 cadre remained in the South, most of them with orders to refocus on political activity and agitation. The Saigon-Cholon Peace Committee, the first Việt Cộng front, was founded in 1954 to provide leadership for this group.

===Government of Ngô Đình Diệm: 1955–1963===

In July 1955, Diệm announced in a broadcast that South Vietnam would not participate in the elections specified in the Geneva Accords. As Saigon&#x27;s delegation did not sign the Geneva Accords, it was not bound by it, despite having been part of the French Union, which was itself bound by the Accords. He also claimed the communist government in the North created conditions that made a fair election impossible in that region. Dennis J. Duncanson described the circumstances prevailing in 1955 and 1956 as &quot;anarchy among sects and of the retiring Việt Minh in the South, the 1956 campaign of terror from Hanoi&#x27;s land reform and resultant peasant uprising around Vinh in the North&quot;.

Diệm held a referendum on 23 October 1955 to determine the future of the country. He asked voters to approve a republic, thus removing Bảo Đại as head of state. The poll was supervised by his younger brother, Ngô Đình Nhu. Diệm was credited with 98 percent of the votes. In many districts, there were more votes to remove Bảo Đại than there were registered voters (e.g., in Saigon, 133% of the registered population reportedly voted to remove Bảo Đại). His American advisors had recommended a more modest winning margin of &quot;60 to 70 percent&quot;. Diệm, however, viewed the election as a test of authority. On 26 October 1955, Diệm declared himself the president of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam. The French, who needed troops to fight in Algeria and were increasingly sidelined by the United States, completely withdrew from Vietnam by April 1956.

The Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. In 1957, independent observers from India, Poland, and Canada representing the International Control Commission (ICC) stated that fair, unbiased elections were not possible, reporting that neither South nor North Vietnam had honored the armistice agreement: &quot;The elections were not held. South Vietnam, which had not signed the Geneva Accords, did not believe the Communists in North Vietnam would allow a fair election. In January 1957, the ICC agreed with this perception, reporting that neither South nor North Vietnam had honored the armistice agreement. With the French gone, a return to the traditional power struggle between north and south had begun again.&quot;

In October 1956 Diệm, with US prodding, launched a land reform program restricting rice farm sizes to a maximum of 247 acres per landowner with the excess land to be sold to landless peasants. More than 1.8m acres of farm land would become available for purchase, the US would pay the landowners and receive payment from the purchasers over a six-year period. Land reform was regarded by the US as a crucial step to build support for the nascent South Vietnamese government and undermine communist propaganda.

The North Vietnamese Communist Party approved a &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; on the South at a session in January 1959 and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. In May 1959, Group 559 was established to maintain and upgrade the Ho Chi Minh Trail, at this time a six-month mountain trek through Laos. About 500 of the &quot;regroupees&quot; of 1954 were sent south on the trail during its first year of operation.

Diệm attempted to stabilise South Vietnam by defending against Việt Cộng activities. He launched an anti-communist denunciation campaign (Tố Cộng) against the Việt Cộng and military campaigns against three powerful groupthe Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo and the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate whose military strength combined amounted to approximately 350,000 fighters.

By 1960 the land reform process had stalled. Diệm had never truly supported reform because many of his biggest supporters were the country&#x27;s largest landowners. While the US threatened to cut aid unless land reform and other changes were made, Diệm correctly assessed that the US was bluffing.

Throughout this period, the level of US aid and political support increased. In spite of this, a 1961 US intelligence estimate reported that &quot;one-half of the entire rural region south and southwest of Saigon, as well as some areas to the north, are under considerable Communist control. Some of these areas are in effect denied to all government authority not immediately backed by substantial armed force. The Việt Cộng&#x27;s strength encircles Saigon and has recently begun to move closer in the city.&quot; The report, later excerpted in &quot;The Pentagon Papers&quot;, continued:

::Many feel that [Diem] is unable to rally the people in the fight against the Communists because of his reliance on virtual one-man rule, his tolerance of corruption extending even to his immediate entourage, and his refusal to relax a rigid system of public controls.

===1963–1973===
The Diệm government lost support among the populace, and from the Kennedy administration, due to its repression of Buddhists and military defeats by the Việt Cộng. Notably, the Huế Phật Đản shootings of 8 May 1963 led to the Buddhist crisis, provoking widespread protests and civil resistance. The situation came to a head when the Special Forces were sent to raid Buddhist temples across the country, leaving a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds. Diệm was overthrown in a coup on 1 November 1963 with the tacit approval of the US.

Diệm&#x27;s removal and assassination set off a period of political instability and declining legitimacy of the Saigon government. General Dương Văn Minh became president, but he was ousted in January 1964 by General Nguyễn Khánh. Phan Khắc Sửu was named head of state, but power remained with a junta of generals led by Khánh, which soon fell to infighting. Meanwhile, the Gulf of Tonkin incident of 2 August 1964 led to a dramatic increase in direct American participation in the war, with nearly 200,000 troops deployed by the end of the year. Khánh sought to capitalize on the crisis with the Vũng Tàu Charter, a new constitution that would have curtailed civil liberties and concentrated his power, but was forced to back down in the face of widespread protests and strikes. Coup attempts followed in September and February 1965, the latter resulting in Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ becoming prime minister and General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu becoming nominal head of state.

Kỳ and Thieu functioned in those roles until 1967, bringing much-desired stability to the government. They imposed censorship and suspended civil liberties, and intensified anticommunist efforts. Under pressure from the US, they held elections for president and the legislature in 1967. The Senate election took place on 2 September 1967. The Presidential election took place on 3 September 1967, Thiệu was elected president with 34% of the vote in a widely criticised poll. The Parliamentary election took place on 22 October 1967.

On 31 January 1968, the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Việt Cộng broke the traditional truce accompanying the Tết (Lunar New Year) holiday. The Tet Offensive failed to spark a national uprising and was militarily disastrous. By bringing the war to South Vietnam&#x27;s cities, however, and by demonstrating the continued strength of communist forces, it marked a turning point in US support for the government in South Vietnam. The new administration of Richard Nixon introduced a policy of Vietnamization to reduce US combat involvement and began negotiations with the North Vietnamese to end the war. Thiệu used the aftermath of the Tet Offensive to sideline Kỳ, his chief rival.

On 26 March 1970 the government began to implement the Land-to-the-Tiller program of land reform with the US providing US$339m of the program&#x27;s US$441m cost. Individual landholdings were limited to 15 hectares.

US and South Vietnamese forces launched a series of attacks on PAVN/VC bases in Cambodia in April–July 1970. South Vietnam launched an invasion of North Vietnamese bases in Laos in February/March 1971 and were defeated by the PAVN in what was widely regarded as a setback for Vietnamization.

Thiệu was reelected unopposed in the Presidential election on 2 October 1971.

North Vietnam launched a conventional invasion of South Vietnam in late March 1972 which was only finally repulsed by October with massive US air support.

===1973–1975===
In accordance with the Paris Peace Accords signed on 27 January 1973, US military forces withdrew from South Vietnam at the end of March 1973 while PAVN forces in the South were permitted to remain in place.

North Vietnamese leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favour their side. As Saigon began to roll back the Việt Cộng, they found it necessary to adopt a new strategy, hammered out at a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973, according to the memoirs of Trần Văn Trà. As the Việt Cộng&#x27;s top commander, Trà participated in several of these meetings. A plan to improve logistics was prepared so that the PAVN would be able to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for 1976. A gas pipeline would be built from North Vietnam to the Việt Cộng provisional capital in Lộc Ninh, about north of Saigon.

On 15 March 1973, Nixon implied that the US would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire. Public reaction was unfavorable, and on 4 June 1973 the US Senate passed the Case–Church Amendment to prohibit such intervention. The oil price shock of October 1973 caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy. A spokesman for Thiệu admitted in a TV interview that the government was being &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the inflation caused by the oil shock, while an American businessman living in Saigon stated after the oil shock that attempting to make money in South Vietnam was &quot;like making love to a corpse&quot;. One consequence of the inflation was the South Vietnamese government had increasing difficulty in paying its soldiers and imposed restrictions on fuel and munition usage.

After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thiệu announced on 4 January 1974 that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There were over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period. The same month, China attacked South Vietnamese forces in the Paracel Islands, taking control of the islands.

In August 1974, Nixon was forced to resign as a result of the Watergate scandal, and the US Congress voted to reduce assistance to South Vietnam from $1 billion a year to $700 million. By this time, the Ho Chi Minh trail, once an arduous mountain trek, had been upgraded into a drivable highway with gasoline stations.

In December 1974, the PAVN launched an invasion at Phuoc Long to test the South Vietnamese combat strength and political will and whether the US would respond militarily. With no US military assistance forthcoming, the ARVN were unable to hold and the PAVN successfully captured many of the districts around the provincial capital of Phuoc Long, weakening ARVN resistance in stronghold areas. President Thiệu later abandoned Phuoc Long in early January 1975. As a result, Phuoc Long was the first provincial capital to fall to the PAVN.

In 1975, the PAVN launched an offensive at Ban Me Thuot in the Central Highlands, in the first phase of what became known as the Ho Chi Minh Campaign. The South Vietnamese unsuccessfully attempted a defence and counterattack but had few reserve forces, as well as a shortage of spare parts and ammunition. As a consequence, Thiệu ordered a withdrawal of key army units from the Central Highlands, which exacerbated an already perilous military situation and undermined the confidence of the ARVN soldiers in their leadership. The retreat became a rout exacerbated by poor planning and conflicting orders from Thiệu. PAVN forces also attacked south and from sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia capturing Huế and Da Nang and advanced southwards. As the military situation deteriorated, ARVN troops began deserting. By early April, the PAVN had overrun almost 3/5th of the South.

Thiệu requested aid from US President Gerald Ford, but the US Senate would not release extra money to provide aid to South Vietnam, and had already passed laws to prevent further involvement in Vietnam. In desperation, Thiệu recalled Kỳ from retirement as a military commander, but resisted calls to name his old rival prime minister.

===Fall of Saigon: April 1975===

Morale was low in South Vietnam as the PAVN advanced. A last-ditch defense was made by the ARVN 18th Division at the Battle of Xuân Lộc from 9–21 April. Thiệu resigned on 21 April 1975, and fled to Taiwan. He nominated his Vice President Trần Văn Hương as his successor. After only one week in office, the South Vietnamese national assembly voted to hand over the presidency to General Dương Văn Minh. Minh was seen as a more conciliatory figure toward the North, and it was hoped he might be able to negotiate a more favourable settlement to end the war. The North, however, was not interested in negotiations, and its forces captured Saigon. Minh unconditionally surrendered Saigon and the rest of South Vietnam to North Vietnam on 30 April 1975.

During the hours leading up to the surrender, the United States undertook a massive evacuation of US government personnel as well as high-ranking members of the ARVN and other South Vietnamese who were seen as potential targets for persecution by the Communists. Many of the evacuees were taken directly by helicopter to multiple aircraft carriers waiting off the coast.

===Provisional Revolutionary Government===

Following the surrender of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces on 30 April 1975, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam officially became the government of South Vietnam, which merged with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to create the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on 2 July 1976.

==Geography==
The South was divided into coastal lowlands, the mountainous Central Highlands (Cao-nguyen Trung-phan) and the Mekong Delta. South Vietnam&#x27;s time zone was one hour ahead of North Vietnam, belonging to the UTC+8 time zone with the same time as the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Taiwan] and Western Australia.

Apart from the mainland, the Republic of Vietnam also administered parts of the Paracels and Spratly Islands. China seized control of the Paracels in 1974 after the South Vietnamese navy attempted an assault on PRC-claimed islands.

==Government and politics==
South Vietnam went through many political changes during its short life. Initially, former Emperor Bảo Đại served as Head of State. He was unpopular however, largely because monarchical leaders were considered collaborators during French rule and because he had spent his reign absent in France.

In 1955, Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm held a referendum to decide whether the State of Vietnam would remain a monarchy or become a republic. This referendum was blatantly rigged in favor of a republic. Not only did an implausible 98% vote in favor of deposing Bảo Đại, but over 380,000 more votes were cast than the total number of registered voters; in Saigon, for instance, Diệm was credited with 133% of the vote. Diệm proclaimed himself the president of the newly formed Republic of Vietnam. Despite successes in politics, economics and social change in the first 5 years, Diệm quickly became a dictatorial leader. With the support of the United States government and the CIA, ARVN officers led by General Dương Văn Minh staged a coup and killed him in 1963. The military held a brief interim military government until General Nguyễn Khánh deposed Minh in a January 1964 coup. Until late 1965, multiple coups and changes of government occurred, with some civilians being allowed to give a semblance of civil rule overseen by a military junta.

In 1965, the feuding civilian government voluntarily resigned and handed power back to the nation&#x27;s military, in the hope this would bring stability and unity to the nation. An elected constituent assembly including representatives of all the branches of the military decided to switch the nation&#x27;s system of government to a semi-presidential system. Military rule initially failed to provide much stability however, as internal conflicts and political inexperience caused various factions of the army to launch coups and counter-coups against one another, making leadership very tumultuous. The situation within the ranks of the military stabilised in mid-1965 when the Republic of Vietnam Air Force chief Nguyễn Cao Kỳ became Prime Minister, with General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu as the figurehead chief of state. As Prime Minister, Kỳ consolidated control of the South Vietnamese government and ruled the country with an iron fist.

In June 1965, Kỳ&#x27;s influence over the ruling military government was solidified when he forced civilian prime minister Phan Huy Quát from power. Often praising aspects of Western culture in public, Ky was supported by the United States and its allied nations, though doubts began to circulate among Western officials by 1966 on whether or not Ky could maintain stability in South Vietnam. A repressive leader, Ky was greatly despised by his fellow countrymen. In early 1966, protesters influenced by popular Buddhist monk Thích Trí Quang attempted an uprising in Quang&#x27;s hometown of Da Nang. The uprising was unsuccessful and Ky&#x27;s repressive stance towards the nation&#x27;s Buddhist population continued.

In 1967, the unicameral National Assembly was replaced by a bicameral system consisting of a House of Representatives or lower house () and a Senate or upper House () and South Vietnam held its first elections under the new system. The military nominated Nguyễn Văn Thiệu as their candidate, and he was elected with a plurality of the popular vote. Thieu quickly consolidated power much to the dismay of those who hoped for an era of more political openness. He was re-elected unopposed in 1971, receiving a suspiciously high 94% of the vote on an 87% turn-out. Thieu ruled until the final days of the war, resigning on 21 April 1975. Vice-president Trần Văn Hương assumed power for a week, but on 27 April the Parliament and Senate voted to transfer power to Dương Văn Minh who was the nation&#x27;s last president and who unconditionally surrendered to the North Vietnamese forces on 30 April 1975.

The National Assembly/House of Representatives was located in the Saigon Opera House, now the Municipal Theatre, Ho Chi Minh City, while the Senate was located at 45-47 Bến Chương Dương Street (), District 1, originally the Chamber of Commerce, and now the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange.

The South Vietnamese government was regularly accused of holding a large number of political prisoners, the exact number of which was a source of contention. Amnesty International, in a report in 1973, estimated the number of South Vietnam&#x27;s civilian prisoners ranging from 35,257 (as confirmed by Saigon) to 200,000 or more. Among them, approximately 22,000–41,000 were accounted &quot;communist&quot; political prisoners.

===Leaders===
*1946–1947 Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina (&quot;Chính phủ Cộng hoà Nam Kỳ tự trị&quot;). The creation of this republic, during the First Indochina War (1946–1954), allowed France to evade a promise to recognise Vietnam as independent. The government was renamed in 1947 &quot;Provisional Government of Southern Vietnam&quot;, overtly stating its aim to reunite the whole country.
**Nguyễn Văn Thinh (1946)
**Lê Văn Hoạch (1946–1947)
**Nguyễn Văn Xuân (1947–1948)
*1948–1949 Provisional Central Government of Vietnam (&quot;Chính phủ lâm thời Quốc gia Việt Nam&quot;). This &quot;pre-Vietnam&quot; government prepared for a unified Vietnamese state, but the country&#x27;s full reunification was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina&#x27;s legal status.
**Nguyễn Văn Xuân (1948–1949)
*1949–1955 State of Vietnam (&quot;Quốc gia Việt Nam&quot;). Internationally recognized in 1950. Roughly 60 percent of Vietnamese territory was actually physically controlled by the communist Việt Minh. Vietnam was partitioned at the 17th parallel in 1954.
**Bảo Đại (1949–1955). Abdicated as emperor (constitutional monarch) in 1945 following surrender of Imperial Japanese occupying forces at the end of World War II, later serving as head of state to 1955.
*1955–1975 Republic of Vietnam (&quot;Việt Nam Cộng Hòa&quot;). Fought in the Vietnam War (or Second Indochina War; 1959–1975) against the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi.
**Ngô Đình Diệm (1955–1963). Once highly lauded by America, he was ousted and assassinated in a US-backed &quot;coup&quot; in November 1963.
**In 1963–1965, there were numerous coups and short-lived governments, several of which were headed by Dương Văn Minh or Nguyễn Khánh.
**Nguyễn Văn Thiệu (1965–1975). Prime Minister Nguyễn Cao Kỳ was the top leader of the last of the military regimes in 1965–1967 before a US-backed civilian government was instituted, following a new constitution and elections in 1967, with Thieu elected president.
**Trần Văn Hương (1975)
**Dương Văn Minh (2nd time) (1975). Surrendered South Vietnam to North Vietnam.
*1975–76 Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (&quot;Chính phủ Cách mạng lâm thời Cộng hoà miền Nam Việt Nam&quot;)
:*Huỳnh Tấn Phát (1975–1976)

===Ministries===
South Vietnam had the following Ministries:
*Ministry of Culture and Education (&quot;Bộ Văn hóa Giáo dục&quot;) at 33–5 Lê Thánh Tôn
*Ministry of Foreign Affairs (&quot;Bộ Ngoại giao&quot;) at 4–6 Rue Colombert (now 4–6 Alexandre de Rhodes)
*Ministry of Health (&quot;Bộ Y tế&quot;) at 57–9 Hong Thap Tu (now 57-9 Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai)
*Ministry of Justice (&quot;Bộ Tư pháp&quot;) at 47 Lê Duẩn
*Ministry of National Defence (&quot;Bộ Quốc phòng&quot;) at 63 Lý Tự Trọng

*Ministry of Public Works and Communications (&quot;Bộ Công chính và Truyền thông&quot;) at 92 Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa
*Ministry of Revolutionary Development

===Administrative divisions===
====Provinces====

South Vietnam was divided into forty-four provinces:

====Regions====
Throughout its history South Vietnam had many reforms enacted that affected the organisation of its administrative divisions.

On 24 October 1956 Diệm enacted a reform of the administrative divisions system of the Republic of Vietnam in the form of Decree 147a/NV. This decree divided the region of Trung phần into Trung nguyên Trung phần (the Central Midlands) and Cao nguyên Trung phần (the Central Highlands).

The offices of appointed representative and assistant representative of the central government were created for the region of Trung phần, the main representative had an office in Buôn Ma Thuột, while the assistant had an office in Huế.

Following the 1963 coup d&#x27;état that ousted Diem the Central Government&#x27;s Representatives in the Trung phần region were gradually replaced by the control of the Tactical zone&#x27;s Commanders (Tư lệnh Vùng Chiến thuật), which replaced a civil administration with a military one. However, following the 1967 Senate election the military administration was replaced back with civilian administrators.

On 1 January 1969, during the presidency of Thiệu, Act 001/69 became effective which abolished the offices of government&#x27;s representative and assistant government&#x27;s representative, this was later followed on 12 May 1969 with Decree 544 – NĐ/ThT/QTCS which completely abolished the civil administration in Trung nguyên Trung phần in favour of the &quot;Tư lệnh Vùng Chiến thuật&quot;.

===Foreign relations===

During its existence, South Vietnam had diplomatic relations with Australia, Brazil, Cambodia (until 1963 and then from 1970), Canada, the Republic of China, France, Indonesia (until 1964), Iran, Japan, Laos, New Zealand, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Vatican and West Germany.

====Relationship with the United States====
During its existence, South Vietnam had a close, strategic alliance with the United States and served as a major counterbalance to communist states like North Vietnam within the Southeast Asian region as a client state of the United States during the Indochina Wars.
The Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. Neither the United States government nor Ngô Đình Diệm&#x27;s State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Viet Minh delegate Phạm Văn Đồng, who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of &quot;local commissions&quot;. The United States countered with what became known as the &quot;American Plan&quot;, with the support of South Vietnam and the United Kingdom. It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the United Nations, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation and North Vietnamese.
U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in 1954 that &quot;I have never talked or corresponded with a person knowledgeable in Indochinese affairs who did not agree that had elections been held as of the time of the fighting, possibly eighty percent of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh as their leader rather than Chief of State Bảo Đại. Indeed, the lack of leadership and drive on the part of Bảo Đại was a factor in the feeling prevalent among Vietnamese that they had nothing to fight for.&quot; According to the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, however, from 1954 to 1956 &quot;Ngô Đình Diệm really did accomplish miracles&quot; in South Vietnam: &quot;It is almost certain that by 1956 the proportion which might have voted for Ho—in a free election against &quot;Diệm&quot;—would have been much smaller than eighty percent.&quot; In 1957, independent observers from India, Poland, and Canada representing the ICC stated that fair, unbiased elections were not possible, reporting that neither South nor North Vietnam had honored the armistice agreement.

The failure to unify the country in 1956 led in 1959 to the foundation of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (commonly known as the Việt Cộng), which initiated an organized and widespread guerrilla insurgency against the South Vietnamese government. Hanoi directed the insurgency, which grew in intensity. The United States, under President Eisenhower, initially sent military advisers to train the South Vietnamese Army. As historian James Gibson summed up the situation: &quot;Strategic hamlets had failed…. The South Vietnamese regime was incapable of winning the peasantry because of its class base among landlords. Indeed, there was no longer a &#x27;regime&#x27; in the sense of a relatively stable political alliance and functioning bureaucracy. Instead, civil government and military operations had virtually ceased. The National Liberation Front had made great progress and was close to declaring provisional revolutionary governments in large areas.&quot; President John F. Kennedy increased the size of the advisory force fourfold and allowed the advisers to participate in combat operations, and later acquiesced in the removal of President Diệm in a military &quot;coup&quot;.

After promising not to do so during the 1964 election campaign, in 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson decided to send in much larger numbers of combat troops, and conflict steadily escalated to become what is commonly known as the Vietnam War. In 1968, the NLF ceased to be an effective fighting organization after the Tet Offensive and the war was largely taken over by regular army units of North Vietnam. Following American withdrawal from the war in 1973, the South Vietnamese government continued fighting the North Vietnamese, until, overwhelmed by a conventional invasion by the North, it finally unconditionally surrendered on 30 April 1975, the day of the fall of Saigon. North Vietnam controlled South Vietnam under military occupation, while the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, which had been proclaimed in June 1969 by the NLF, became the nominal government. The North Vietnamese quickly moved to marginalise non-communist members of the PRG and integrate South Vietnam into the communist North. The unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam was inaugurated on 2 July 1976.

The Embassy of the Republic of Vietnam in Washington donated 527 reels of South Vietnamese-produced film to the Library of Congress during the embassy&#x27;s closure following the Fall of Saigon, which are in the Library to this day.

====International organisations====
South Vietnam was a member of accT, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the IMF, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Intelsat), Interpol, the IOC, the ITU, the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (LORCS), UNESCO and the Universal Postal Union (UPU).

===Military===

The Republic of Vietnam Military Forces (RVNMF; – QLVNCH), was formally established on 30 December 1955. Created out from ex-French Union Army colonial Indochinese auxiliary units (French: &quot;Supplétifs&quot;), gathered earlier in July 1951 into the French-led Vietnamese National Army – VNA (Vietnamese: &quot;Quân Đội Quốc Gia Việt Nam&quot; – QĐQGVN), Armée Nationale Vietnamiènne (ANV) in French, the armed forces of the new state consisted in the mid-1950s of ground, air, and naval branches of service, respectively:

*Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)
*Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF)
*Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVNN)
*Republic of Vietnam Marine Division (RVNMD)

Their roles were defined as follows: to protect the sovereignty of the free Vietnamese nation and that of the Republic; to maintain the political and social order and the rule of law by providing internal security; to defend the newly independent Republic of Vietnam from external (and internal) threats; and ultimately, to help reunify Vietnam.

The French ceased training the QLVNCH in 1956 and training passed to American advisers who progressively restructured the military along US military lines.

The country was divided from north to south into four corps tactical zones: I Corps, II Corps, III Corps, IV Corps and the Capital Military District in and around Saigon.

At the time of signing of the Paris Peace Accords, the South Vietnamese government fielded the fourth largest military force in the world as a result of the American Enhance and Enhance Plus programs with approximately one and one-half million troops in uniform. The lack of sufficient training and dependence on the U.S. for spare parts, fuel, and ammunition caused maintenance and logistical problems. The impact of the 1973 oil crisis, a faltering economy, inflation and reduced US aid led to a steady decline in South Vietnamese military expenditure and effectiveness.

==Economy==

South Vietnam maintained a capitalist free-market economy with ties to the West. It established an airline named Air Vietnam. The economy was greatly assisted by American aid and the presence of large numbers of Americans in the country between 1961 and 1973 during Vietnam War. Electrical production increased fourteen-fold between 1954 and 1973 while industrial output increase by an average of 6.9 percent annually. During the same period, rice output increased by 203 percent and the number of students in university increased from 2,000 to 90,000. US aid peaked at $2.3 billion in 1973, but dropped to $1.1 billion in 1974. Inflation rose to 200 percent as the country suffered economic shock due to the decrease of American aid as well as the oil price shock of October 1973. The unification of Vietnam in 1976 was followed by the imposition of North Vietnam&#x27;s centrally planned economy in the South.

A 2017 study in the journal &quot;Diplomatic History&quot; found that South Vietnamese economic planners sought to model the South Vietnamese economy on Taiwan and South Korea, which were perceived as successful examples of how to modernize developing economies.

==Demographics==

In 1968, the population of South Vietnam was estimated to be 16,259,334. However, about one-fifth of the people who lived in Southern Vietnam (from Quang Tri Province to the South) lived in areas that were controlled by Viet Cong. In 1970 about 90% of population was Kinh (Viet), and 10% was Hoa (Chinese), Montagnard, French, Khmer, Cham, Eurasians and others.

Vietnamese was the official language and was spoken by the majority of the population. Despite the end of French colonial rule, the French language maintained a strong presence in South Vietnam where it was used in administration, education (especially at the secondary and higher levels), trade and diplomacy. The ruling elite of South Vietnam spoke French. With US involvement in the Vietnam War, English was also later introduced to the armed forces and became a secondary diplomatic language. Languages spoken by minority groups included Chinese, Khmer, Cham, and other languages spoken by Montagnard groups.

Starting from 1955, the South Vietnamese government of Ngô Đình Diệm carried out an assimilation policy towards indigenous peoples (Montagnard) of the Central Highlands and the Cham people, including banning the Cham language in public schools, seizing indigenous lands and granting them to mostly Catholic Northern Kinh people who had moved to South Vietnam during Operation Passage to Freedom. This resulted in increasing nationalism and support for independence among the Cham and other indigenous peoples. Some Cham joined the Viet Cong, some others joined the Front de Libération des Hauts Plateaux du Champa. By 1964, civil rights activists and independent organizations of the indigenous peoples, including Cham organizations, had been merged into the Front Unifié de Lutte des Races Opprimées (FULRO), which struggled against both the governments of South Vietnam and the succeeding Socialist Republic of Vietnam until the late 1980s.
The majority of the population identified as Buddhists. Approximately 10% of the population was Christian, mainly Catholic. Other religions included Caodaism and Hoahaoism. Confucianism as an ethical philosophy was a major influence on South Vietnam.

==Culture==
Cultural life was strongly influenced by China until French domination in the 18th century. At that time, the traditional culture began to acquire an overlay of Western characteristics. Many families had three generations living under one roof. The emerging South Vietnamese middle class and youth in the 1960s became increasingly more Westernised, and followed American cultural and social trends, especially in music, fashion and social attitudes in major cities like Saigon.

===Media===
====Radio====

There were four AM and one FM radio stations, all of them owned by the government (VTVN), named . One of them was designated as a nationwide civilian broadcast, another was for military service and the other two stations included a French-language broadcast station and foreign language station broadcasting in Chinese, English, Khmer and Thai. Radio Vietnam started its operation in 1955 under then President Ngo Dinh Diem, and ceased operation on 30 April 1975, with the broadcast of surrender by Duong Van Minh. The radio stations across the former South were later reused by the communist regime to broadcast their state-run radio service.

====Television====

Television was introduced to South Vietnam on 7 February 1966 with a black-and-white FCC system. Covering major cities in South Vietnam, started with a one-hour broadcast per day then increased to six hours in the evening during the 1970s. There were two main channels:
*THVN-TV (Truyền hình Việt Nam-TV) on Channel 9, featuring Vietnamese-language shows, news, and special announcements from Saigon. This entirely Vietnamese language channel catered to the Vietnamese populace.
*AFVN-TV on Channel 11, operated by Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (now American Forces Network), catered to US troops in South Vietnam. Broadcasting entirely in English, it relayed popular US-made shows like &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and various sports games like the World Series. It also broadcast news and special announcements from the American government and military commanders.

Both channels used an airborne transmission relay system from airplanes flying at high altitudes, called Stratovision.

<text>An angler&#x27;s loop, otherwise known as a perfection loop, is a type of knot which forms a fixed loop. Useful for fine or slippery line, it is one of the few loop knots which holds well in bungee cord. It is quite secure, but it jams badly and is not suitable if the knot will need to be untied.

==Tying==
Angler&#x27;s loop may be tied 
* alone and then used, 
** it may be tied in the bight or at the working end
** it may be tied one handed
** it may be fashioned with several loops
** it may be locked for additional stability
** it may be tied at high speed in an emergency
* it may be tied through an object (typically a ring).



Angler&#x27;s loop may be tied around the hand, it may also be tied this way one handed, or with several loops if need be:

* Angler&#x27;s loop may be locked additionally with half hitches
* Angler&#x27;s loop may be fashioned with several loops (then locking may be necessary)
== Structure ==
Overhand knot on standing part and half-hitch by the working end.

<text>Demographic features of the population of the Netherlands include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the population, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Population==
The Netherlands is the 69th most populous country in the world. As of January 2023, the Netherlands has a population of 17,821,419.

Between 1900 and 1950 the population almost doubled from 5.14 to 10.11 million people. From 1950 to 2000 the population increased from 10.11 to 15.92 million people, increasing by a smaller proportion but, still, at an impressive pace for a European country, recording a growth of 57.45% over a 50-year time span.

Of countries with at least 7.5 million people, The Netherlands is the 4th most densely populated, and is the 33rd most densely populated in the world overall. It is the 5th most densely populated country in Europe; the first four are microstates. The 17,821,419 million Dutch inhabitants are concentrated on an area of including water surface, the land surface being . This means that the country has a population density of . The density of 500 inhabitants/km2 was reached in the first half of 2014.

As a result of these demographic characteristics, the Netherlands has had to plan its land use strictly. Since 1946 the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment has been occupied with the national coordination of land use. Because of its high population density the Netherlands has also reclaimed land from the sea by poldering. Between 1927 and 1968 an entire province - Flevoland - was created. As of May 2023 it houses 447,193 people. Because of these policies, the Dutch have been able to combine high levels of population density with extremely high levels of agricultural production.

Even though the Netherlands is so densely populated, it has no municipalities with a population over one million. Nevertheless, the two largest municipalities of the country do score well over a million if the complete city region is counted, thus including the neighbouring satellite towns that often are physically connected to the main municipality. Moreover, the &quot;four big cities&quot; (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) can in many ways be regarded as a single metropolitan area, the Randstad (&quot;rim city&quot; or &quot;edge city&quot;) with over 7.5 million inhabitants around an agricultural &quot;green heart&quot; (&quot;Groene Hart&quot;).

Demographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2019.

*One birth every 3 minutes
*One death every 4 minutes
*One net migrant every 31 minutes
*Net gain of one person every 11 minutes


=== Growth rate ===
0.37% (2021 est.) Country comparison to the world: 168th

=== Fertility ===

The Dutch population is ageing. Furthermore, life expectancy has increased because of developments in medicine, and in addition to this, the Netherlands has seen increasing immigration. Despite these developments combined with the population boom after the Second World War, the low birth rate has caused extremely low population growth: 2005 saw the lowest absolute population growth since 1900.

This demographic development has consequences for health care and social security policy. As the Dutch population ages, the proportion of people of working age, as a percentage of the entire population, decreases. Important policy advisors like the CBS (Statistical Office) and the CPB (Planning Office) have pointed out that this will cause problems with the current system of old age pensions: fewer people will work to pay for old age pensions, while there will be more people receiving those pensions. Furthermore, the costs of health care are also projected to increase. These developments have caused several cabinets, notably the second Balkenende cabinet to reform the system of health care and social security to increase participation in the labour market and make people more conscious of the money they spend on health care.

In 2003, the annual birth rate per thousand was highest in the province of Flevoland (15.9). The overall lifelong Total fertility rate (TFR), was highest in the province of Flevoland (2.0) and lowest in the province of Limburg (1.6). The municipality with the highest TFR was Urk (3.23) followed by Valkenburg (2.83), Graafstroom (2.79) and Staphorst (2.76). The lowest TFRs were recorded in Vaals (1.11) and Thorn (1.21).

The total population at December 31, 2006 was 16,356,914. The population loss due to net emigration was 35,502 (an estimated 40-50% of emigrants were ethnic non-Dutch).

In 2007, there were 117,000 immigrants (including 7000 Germans, 6000 Poles, 5000 Bulgarians, 3000 Turks and 2000 Moroccans) and 123,000 emigrants. Nearly half the emigrants were native Dutch, followed at a distance by nearly 5000 Poles and more than 3000 Germans. There was an observable increase in net immigration from the former USSR, Bulgaria and Romania.

The annual death rate was lowest in the municipalities of Valkenburg (2.9 per 1000), Zeewolde (3.2), Renswoude (3.4), Westervoort and Zeevang (both 3.9). The highest annual death rates were recorded in Warmond (22.3 per 1000), Laren (19.9) and Doorn (18.8).

16.4% of the total births in 2003 were to parents of non-European origin, although they account for only 12.4% of the population in the 25-34 age group. For example, 3.8% of the births were ethnic Moroccan, although they were only 2.26% of the 25-34 age group. Respective figures were 3.27% and 3.0% for Turks. The TFR for Moroccans in 2003 was 3.3 while the general TFR was 1.73. TFR was 2.3 for Turks, 1.7 for Surinamese, 1.8 for Arubans, 3.0 for Africans and 1.8 for Americans. (These figures compare with a figure of around 2.1 required to maintain a stable overall population figure.)

According to Statistics Netherlands, for the year 2007, the TFR for those born in Netherlands was 1.72 (1.65 in 2000). TFR of Moroccan immigrants was 2.87 (3.22 in 2000) and that of Turkish immigrants was 1.88 (2.18 in 2000).

The total fertility rate is the annual average number of children born per woman over her lifespan. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: Our World In Data and Gapminder Foundation.

&quot;Functional urban areas&quot; are a type of urban areas with large populations where commuters from nearby areas work in the core area. There are several functional urban areas officially identified in the Netherlands. The largest ones (with populations over 300,000) are listed below, which count the populations of the core city and their &quot;commuting zones&quot;.

==Migration and origin groups==
Between 1590 and 1800 the estimated share of foreign-born population was consistently above 5%.

According to Eurostat, in 2010 there were 1,800,000 foreign-born residents in the Netherlands, corresponding to 11.1% of the total population. Of these, 1,400,000 (8.5%) were born outside the EU (including those from Dutch colonies) and 428,000 (2.6%) were born in another EU member state. The most common countries of birth being: Belgium, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. On 1 January 2016, 26.2% of persons aged 0–50 had at least one parent born in a foreign country. 11.4% of persons aged 0–50 of &#x27;Dutch background&#x27; belonged to the &#x27;third generation&#x27;, the majority descending from Western immigrants. The third generation constitutes persons born from two second generation immigrants or one second generation immigrant and one person with a Dutch background. First and second generation immigrants and the third generation were 34.5% of the population aged 0–50.

As the result of immigration from overseas, the Netherlands have a sizeable minority of non-indigenous peoples. There is also a considerable level of emigration, in majority consisting of former immigrants. In 2005, some 121,000 people left the country, while 94,000 entered it. Out of a total of 101,150 people immigrating into the Netherlands in 2006, 66,658 were from Europe, Oceania, the Americas or Japan, and 34,492 were from other (mostly developing) countries. Out of a total of 132,470 emigrants, 94,834 were going to Europe, Oceania, the Americas or Japan and 37,636 to other countries.

A large number of immigrants come from countries in Western Europe, mostly from the neighbouring countries of Germany and Belgium. There were five subsequent waves of immigration to the Netherlands in recent history.
# In the late-1940s and into the 1950s, following the end of the Second World War, people from the newly independent Republic of Indonesia repatriated or emigrated to the Netherlands - mainly Indo-European (people of mixed European and Indonesian ancestry of Dutch nationality) and supporters of the Republic of South Maluku.
# Between 1960 and 1974, migrants from Greece, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and Morocco came to work in the Netherlands as guest workers. They were expected to return to their own country and many did, but others remained and in the 1970s and 1980s were joined by their families. Until 2004, when marriage immigration was restricted, their children usually married others from their home country.
# After 1974, people emigrated from the newly independent Suriname and from the Netherlands Antilles, which remained part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1974, about forty thousand Surinamese migrated while still retaining Dutch citizenship; between 1975 and 1980 there was a transitional arrangement allowing migration. Antilleans have the Dutch nationality and behave like typical labour migrants, travelling to and from the country in response to the employment available.
# During the 1970s and 1980s, the number of asylum seekers was low, consisting e.g. of Chileans fleeing from political oppression and/or persecution. In the 1990s, asylum migration sharply increased, largely consisting of Yugoslavs, Somalis, Iraqis, Iranians, Ethiopians, Eritreans, Afghans and Vietnamese, fleeing war or famine. Between 2000 and 2014 asylum migration strongly decreased due to the strict &quot;Cohen Law&quot;. However, the Syrian Civil War from 2011 resulted in a large influx of Syrian asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016; about ninety thousand Syrians had been granted asylum by 2018.
# Since the 2000s, migrant workers and their families from the newly joined EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe, including: Poland, and Bulgaria, and non-EU states , Ukraine and the former Yugoslavia. In addition, a number of Spaniards, Greeks, Italians, and Portuguese also migrated due to the impact of the Great Recession in those countries. In 2005, non-Western ethnic population comprised 1.7 million individuals, about 10% of the population in the country.

Illegal immigration to the Netherlands results in automatic deportation but this is often not enforced for various reasons such as unknown country of origin, etc. Many Dutch provinces in 2012 had quotas for deporting illegal immigrants.

By 2017, persons with an immigration background, both western and non-western, formed a majority in Amsterdam (2011), Rotterdam (2013) and The Hague, the three largest cities of the Netherlands.

In 2005, the governmental &quot;Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau&quot; in its annual report, noted recurring integration problems for ethnic minorities. While during the economic boom of the 1990s their unemployment and dependence on welfare had strongly decreased, the economic downturn between 2001 and 2004 disproportionally affected immigrant groups. This would be explained by their functioning as a labour reserve, by their lower educational levels and by lower language skills. The report also noted that per capita social interactions between native Dutch and immigrant populations tended to decline over time, partly explainable by the size growth of immigrant groups. Integration levels strongly varied between groups. Surinamese and Antilleans were well economically integrated, but the latter less so culturally. Cultural integration was limited for Turks, but better for Moroccans. Of the asylum seekers, Somalis were among the least integrated into Dutch society, while Iranians were the best integrated with the highest education levels and modern lifestyles. Though the educational levels of the second generation were a significant improvement over those of the first generation, they still lagged behind the native Dutch who themselves on average had been attending ever higher school types. While half of all native Dutch pupils in 2005 proceeded to higher secondary education (HAVO and VWO), for Turks and Moroccans the share was a fifth and for Somali pupils even lower.

In 2007, non-Western groups were generally socio-economically disadvantaged. Of the four largest non-Western groups, Turks and Moroccans were the most disadvantaged. In 2006, only 38.7% of Moroccans and 43.9% of Turks aged 15–64 were employed, meaning their unemployment rate was about four times that of the native Dutch (17.2% for Moroccans and 15.1% for Turks), and 30% received some type of social welfare.

After 2008, the financial crisis and the eurocrisis again hit immigrant groups particularly hard. In 2012, at 12% non-Western migrants were six times more likely than native Dutch to receive social welfare benefits, with 2% for the Dutch.
According to a 2010 Statistics Netherlands report, the third generation of non-Western immigrants was predominantly young with 80% being younger than 15, while growing with 10% each year. The third generation have a similar employment rate as the native Dutch and receive a similar amount of social benefits. The third non-Western generation follow adult education more frequently than both the native Dutch and non-Western immigrants. The non-Western immigrant population as a whole has 1.5 to 2 times the benefit dependence compared to the natives. The non-Western third generation had a rate slightly higher than the native Dutch as crime suspects, but lower than for non-Western immigrants as a whole.

According to Statistics Netherlands, nearly 53% of refugee households have a low income, six times the Netherlands average (8.2%). For Syrian and Eritrean households the share is about 80%. At 33% the poverty risk is lowest among Iranian refugee households. The group of Syrian households at risk of poverty grew from ten thousand (76% of all Syrian households in 2016) to eighteen thousand (79% of all Syrian households) in 2018. Households of Polish, Romanian or Bulgarian origin have a greater than average risk of poverty even though households from these Eastern European countries generally depend on work for their income. Migrant workers from Eastern Europe generally perform low-skilled work while migrants from Western Europe are often highly educated.

Immigrants from foreign countries are divided into several ethnic groups. For example, there are both Russians and Chechens from Russia, Turks and Kurds from Turkey, Serbs and Albanians from Serbia and immigrants from Iran are divided into Persians, Azeris and Kurds.

===Net migration of the Netherlands, 1995-present===

===National origins===


, 4,438,900 citizens are of non-Dutch/Frisian origin. A majority of these (50,86%) are from seven backgrounds alone: Turks (inc. Kurds), Moroccans (inc. Berbers), Surinamese, Indonesians (inc. Moluccans), Germans, Poles and Curaçao.

With the huge expansion of the European Union during the 2000s, the Netherlands has seen a rise in the number of immigrants coming from new member states. Migrant workers from these countries are estimated to be about 100,000 as of 2007. Legal migrants from new EU-member states doubled between 2007–11 to 200,000, with estimates totaling up to 300,000. Of the Poles who initially moved to the Netherlands in 2004, about a quarter had returned to Poland by 2006. In addition, a large number of Syrians moved to the Netherlands in the 2010s mostly as refugees, with the population increasing seven-fold between 2014 and 2019. Both Poles and Syrians have overtaken the population of Antilleans during the decade. More than 36,000 Roma live in the Netherlands. Dutch Roma, Sinti and Dutch Jews were decimated by the Holocaust. However, the Jewish population has seen growth in the Netherlands in recent years.



===Emigration===

The Netherlands has seen considerable emigration. In the 1950s&#x27; and early 1960s, 560,000 people migrated to the United States, South Africa, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, leaving their war-torn and overpopulated home country behind. At least 60,000 of these migrants were Indo-European (mixed Dutch-Indonesian) repatriates that moved on, mostly to the United States, after being repatriated to the Netherlands from the former Dutch East Indies during and after the Indonesian Revolution.

In 2005, some 121,000 people migrated from the Netherlands. There is considerable migration towards neighbouring states, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom and to the Netherlands Antilles. Furthermore, almost half of the current emigration consists of people returning to their country of birth, including rejected asylum seekers, after the more stringent migration laws were implemented.

===Education by background===
According to a 2016 study by Statistics Netherlands, students with a non-western background generally study at a lower level of secondary education. 48 percent of those with a Dutch background were at HAVO or VWO level at third year, compared to 23 percent for Dutch Turks, 28 percent for Dutch Moroccans, 35 percent for Dutch Surinamese and 31 percent for Dutch Antilleans. Some backgrounds fared better: over 40 percent of Dutch Afghans studied at HAVO/VWO level, and for Dutch Iranians the rate was 50 percent, which was above native Dutch students.

==Employment and income==
Unemployment, youth ages 15–24
:total: 7.2%. Country comparison to the world: 130th
:male: 7.7%
:female: 6.6% (2018 est.)

== Religion ==

In 2013, Statistics Netherlands found that 26% of the population identified as Roman Catholic, 16% as Protestant, 5% as Muslim, and 6% as &quot;other&quot; (the last includes other Christian denominations, Hindus 0.6%, Jews 0.1%, and Buddhists 0.4%). The agency interviewed 355,237 people in the period 2010–2013. In 2019, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported that for the first time non-religious people were in the majority in the Netherlands. Only 49% of people older than 15 years reported to be religious; in 2012 that was still 54%. The largest religion was still Catholicism (24%), while 5% identified with Islam.

==Language==

The main language is Dutch, while Frisian (known as West Frisian outside of the Netherlands) is also a recognized language in the province of Friesland and is used by the government and schools there. Several dialects of Low Saxon (Nedersaksisch in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east and are recognized by the Netherlands as regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Another group of dialects granted the status of regional language is Limburgish, which is spoken in the south-eastern province of Limburg. Major immigrant languages are Indonesian, Turkish, Arabic, Berber, Papiamento, German and Polish.

<text>The [[economy]] of the [[Netherlands]] is a highly developed market economy focused on trade and logistics, manufacturing, services, innovation and technology and sustainable and renewable energy. It is the world&#x27;s 18th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 28th largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) and is the fifth largest economy in European Union by nominal GDP. It has the world&#x27;s 11th highest per capita GDP (nominal) and the 13th highest per capita GDP (PPP) as of 2023 making it one of the highest earning nations in the world. Many of the world&#x27;s largest tech companies are based in its capital Amsterdam or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Cisco, Uber and Netflix. Its second largest city Rotterdam is a major trade, logistics and economic center of the world and is Europe&#x27;s largest seaport. Netherlands is ranked fifth on global innovation index and fourth on the Global Competitiveness Report. Among OECD nations, Netherlands has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 25.3% of GDP. 

The Netherlands has a prosperous and open economy, which depends heavily on foreign trade. The economy is noted for stable industrial relations, fairly low unemployment and inflation, a sizable current account surplus (which, compared to the size of the country, is even more than Germany) and an important role as a European transportation hub; Rotterdam is the biggest port in Europe; and Amsterdam has one of the biggest airports in the world. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, high-tech, financial services, the creative sector and electrical machinery. Its highly mechanized agricultural sector employs no more than 2% of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002.

The Netherlands has had steady natural gas resources since 1959, when a wellspring was discovered. Currently the Netherlands accounts for more than 25% of all natural gas reserves in the European Union. Over the following decades, the sale of natural gas generated a significant rise in revenue for the Netherlands. However, the unforeseen consequences of the country&#x27;s energy wealth originally impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy, leading to the theory of Dutch disease, after the discovery of the vast Groningen gas field.

The Netherlands is a &quot;conduit country&quot; that helps to funnel profits from high-tax countries to tax havens. It has been ranked as the 7th largest tax haven in the World.

The stern financial was abandoned in 2009, because of the then-current credit crises. The relatively large banking sector was partly nationalized and bailed out through government interventions. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.0% in the summer of 2011, but increased with a sharp rate to 7.3% in May 2013, and 6.8% in 2015. It dropped again to 3.9% in March 2018. The state budget deficit was about 2.2% in 2015, well below the norm of 3.0% in the EU. In 2016, the state budget showed a surplus of 0.4%. It was expected to grow to a surplus of over 1.0% in 2017.
Historically, the Dutch introduced and invented the stock market, which initially focused on merchandise trading through the Dutch East India Company. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, the OECD and the World Trade Organization.

==History==
After declaring its independence from the empire of Philip II of Spain in 1581, the Netherlands experienced almost a century of explosive economic growth. A technological revolution in capital, due to Protestant traders of Flanders who fled to the Netherlands, helped the young Republic become the dominant trade power by the mid-17th century. In 1670 the Dutch merchant marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping—about half the European total. The main reasons for this were the dominance of the Amsterdam Entrepôt in European trade, and that of the Dutch East India Company (or Verenigde Oost-Indische Companie – VOC) and West India Companies in intercontinental trade. These companies were based on the English model and the success of England&#x27;s joint-stock enterprises and trading guilds.

Beside trade, an early &quot;industrial revolution&quot; (powered by wind, water and peat), land reclamation from the sea, and agricultural revolution, helped the Dutch economy achieve the highest standard of living in Europe (and presumably the world) by the middle of the 17th century. Affluence facilitated what is known as the Dutch Golden Age. This economic boom abruptly came to an end by a combination of political-military upheavals and adverse economic developments around 1670. Still the Netherlands kept a high level of prosperity, due to trade and agriculture.

Towards the 1800s, the Netherlands did not industrialize as rapidly as some other countries in Europe. One explanation for this is that the Netherlands were struggling to come to terms with having lost their dominant economical (based mainly on trade and agriculture) and political position in the world. Griffiths argues that government policies made possible a unified Dutch national economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal tariffs and guilds; a unified coinage system; modern methods of tax collection; standardized weights and measures; and the building of many roads, canals, and railroads.

The rest of Europe in the 19th century saw the gradual transformation of the Netherlands into a modern middle-class industrial society. The number of people employed in agriculture decreased while the country made an effort to revive its stake in the highly competitive industrial and trade business. The Netherlands lagged behind Belgium until the late 19th century in industrialization, then caught up by about 1920. Major industries included textiles and (later) the great Philips industrial conglomerate. Rotterdam became a major shipping and manufacturing center. Poverty slowly declined and begging largely disappeared along with steadily improving working conditions for the population.

In 1959, the Netherlands discovered large natural gas fields. The export of natural gas led to large windfall profits. However, as an unforeseen consequence, these were believed to have led to a decline in the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands.

==Government==
While the private sector is the cornerstone of the Dutch economy, governments at different levels have a large part to play. Public spending, excluding social security transfer payments, was at 28% of GDP in 2011. Total tax revenue was 38.7% of GDP in 2010, which was below the EU average. In addition to its own spending, the government plays a significant role through the permit requirements and regulations pertaining to almost every aspect of economic activity. The government combines a rigorous and stable microeconomic policy with wide-ranging structural and regulatory reforms. The government has gradually reduced its role in the economy since the 1980s. Privatization and deregulation is still continuing. With regards to social and economic policy, the government cooperates with its so called social partners (trade unions and employers&#x27; organizations). The three parties come together in the Social-Economic Council (‘Sociaal Economische Raad’), the main platform for social dialogue.

=== Social security system ===
The Dutch social security is very comprehensive and multi-faceted, and is divided into the national security (&quot;Volksverzekering)&quot; and the employee insurance (&quot;Werknemersverzekering).&quot; Whereas the first covers all living in the Netherlands and the social benefits provided, the latter provides employment-related benefits. All living in the Netherlands are required to pay into the social security system, including residents from outside the Netherlands, with a few exceptions.

The Volksverzekering is compulsory for all and covers the residents under different forms of national insurance:
* Long-term care under the Long-Term Care Act (&quot;Wet Langdurige Zorg (WLZ)) (&quot;formerly known as The Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (Algemen Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ)))
* Pension care under the General Old Age Pensions Act (&quot;Algemene Ouderdomswet (AOW))&quot;
* Survivor benefits under the General Surviving Relatives Act (&quot;Algemene nabestaandenwet( ANW)) (formerly known as &quot;The General Widow&#x27;s and Orphans’ Act (Algemene Weduwen-en Wezenwet (AWW)))
* Child benefits under the General Family Allowances Act (&quot;Algemene Kinderbijslagwet (AKW))&quot;
It is overseen by the Social Insurance Bank (&quot;Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB))&quot; and financed through earning-related contributions of employers and employees up until a maximum income-ceiling. Whilst employed persons get their contribution deducted automatically from their wage, the unemployed pay by themselves. The AKW is financed by employers, whereas the AOW is financed by the employees. The AOW, additionally, is financed by a small government subsidy.

The &quot;Werknemersverzekering&quot; is compulsory for all employed people within the Netherlands. It includes the coverage of employees in the following areas:
* Unemployment benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act (&quot;Werkloosheidswet (WW))&quot;
* Sick leave under the Sickness Benefits Act (&quot;Ziektewet (ZW))&quot;
* Disability benefits under the Disablement Insurance Act (&quot;Wet werk en inkomen naar arbeidsvermogen&quot; &quot;(WIA))&quot;
The financing for the &quot;Werknemersverzekering&quot; is automatically deducted from the employee&#x27;s income by the employer.

==== Unemployment benefits ====

===== Coverage =====
The unemployment benefits in the Netherlands, as set out under the WW, covers almost all employees, that are employees based on a working-contract. Excluded from the WW are the following: self-employed, nationally employed, persons working less than four days a week, heads of stockholders and voluntary workers that earn up to €150 per year.

===== Right to benefits =====
To profit from the benefit the unemployed has to submit an application to the Employee Insurance Agency (&quot;Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen (UWV))&quot; within one week of becoming unemployed and additionally has to register as job-seeker. The WW only covers employees with a sufficient work history, meaning that an applicant has to have been working for at least 26 weeks in the past 36 weeks before becoming unemployed. If so, the working-weeks requirement is met. Moreover, the employee is only eligible to unemployment benefits if the unemployment has not been due to his own fault (e.g. own termination of the job contract).

===== Benefits =====
The benefits received through the WW are earnings-related and amount to 75% of the previous daily earnings (based on 5 working days per week) for the duration of two months. After those two months the benefits reduce to 70%. Part-time work is taken into account with a calculation of parts of the working hours. If this benefit is less than the minimum income, the benefit can be supplemented under the Additional Allowances Act (&quot;Toeslagenwet&quot;). If there has been a change of employment, all jobs in the previous twelve months are included in the calculation of the benefits. To continue to receive benefits, the individual needs to be actively looking for work. Moreover, one needs to participate in e-coaching three and twelve months after the start of unemployment. After one year of unemployment one must register with an employment agency.

===Controversial issues===
====Labour market and social welfare====
The Dutch labour market has relatively strict regulations for employers on firing employees, although by June 2014 the House of Representatives has agreed to loosen these regulations. Due to the costs of employees and costs of firing them, a large part of the working force (about 15% of the working force) is an independent one person company (ZZP). They are independent and get paid by delivery without higher social costs. Another big part of the workforce is hired as temporary workforce. State unemployment benefits in the form of a 70% benefit of the employee&#x27;s last-earned salary for up to three years (with a maximum of roughly 2500 euros per month) are available for fired employees, provided that they have worked for a certain minimum time period, usually 26 weeks. Moreover, the self-employed individuals (zelfstandigen zonder personeel (ZZP)) are not automatically covered under the &quot;Werknemersverzekeringen&quot;, and are not obligated to enroll into unemployment, sickness or disabilities insurance. Self-employed individuals are therefore required to enroll themselves with private insurance companies.

====Age of retirement====
Under the AOW (General Old Age Pensions Act) of 1956, every Dutch citizen was entitled to a state pension from the age of 65. However the act was amended in 2012 to increase the pension age in several stages up to 67 in 2024. Married couples and those who live together receive 50% of minimum wage per person, and a single person receives 70% of minimum wage. Most (about 70%) earn an extra pension from private pension funds. Employees are obliged to participate in the sector pension funds. The total amount of pension funds at the end of 2009 was some 664 billion euro and by the end of 2019 this had increased to 1560 billion euro, for a population of just over 17 million. Employees receive on average about 70% of their final salary. During the economic crisis and because of low interest rates, pension funds have had difficulty keeping up with inflation.

==== Inequality and redistribution====
With a Gini coefficient of 25.1 (2013) the income inequality is relatively low in the Netherlands. However, the inequality when measured in distributions of household wealth is high, where the top 1% owns 24% of all net wealth, and the top 10% own 60%. Moreover, rather large wealth disparities persist in the Netherlands in relation to age, where those under 35 years-of-age own 10% as much as older workers. This is a consequence from the low taxation of home ownership and a generous mortgage interest deductibility, which benefit the wealthier households. Due to the generous pensions the pension-related savings are the most important part of wealth in the Netherlands, yet are not subject to capital income taxation, which increases the inequality. The taxation comes as income tax when the saved pension is paid out. People having earned minimum wages only, will not build up any pension. The idea behind a pension is to have a net income after retirement that is comparable to before retirement. The AOW, the Dutch retirement law, guarantees an income up to 70% of minimum wage per person. Therefore, only people earning more than minimum wage need to save to ensure comparable income after retirement.

==== Home mortgage interest deduction ====
The Netherlands was one of the few countries in the world where the interest paid on mortgages is almost fully deductible from income tax. Since 2013 big changes were made. The conditions allowing a borrowing of more than 116% of the value of the home were reduced to 106% and are still continuously being reduced every year. The deduction is also capped to 50.5% and reducing every year. Together with the after-effects of the Great Recession the result was a housing crisis, with a decrease of prices almost 25% percent in some areas. Recent years have shown a recovery of 10% to even 20% per year in the most popular cities.

The Service sector accounts for more than half of the national income, primarily in transportation, distribution and logistics, financial areas, software development and the creative industry. The breadth of service providers in financial services has contributed to the Netherlands achieving a DAW Index score of 5 in 2012. Industrial activity is dominated by the machinery, electronics/high tech industry, metalworking, oil refining, chemical, and food-processing industries. Construction amounts to about 6% of GDP. Agriculture and fishing, although visible and traditional Dutch activities, account for just 2%.

The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007. The Netherlands is the fifth-most competitive economy in the world, according to the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Competitiveness Report.

== Primary sector ==
=== Agriculture ===
In 2018, in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, the Netherlands produced:
* 1.2 million tons of onion;
* 14 million tons of cow milk;
* 247 thousand tons of barley;
* 269 thousand tons of apple;
* 295 thousand tons of lettuce;
* 300 thousand tons of mushroom and truffle;
* 355 thousand tons of bell pepper;
* 402 thousand tons of pear;
* 410 thousand tons of cucumber;
* 538 thousand tons of carrot;
* 6.0 million tonnes of potatoes (10th largest producer in the world);
* 6.5 million tons of sugar beet, which is used to produce sugar and ethanol;
* 910 thousand tons of tomato;
* 961 thousand tons of wheat.

== Energy sector ==
=== Natural gas ===

The discovery of the large Groningen natural gas field in 1959 and the massive windfalls accrued over subsequent decades, were believed to have led to a decline in the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands, leading to the theory of Dutch disease.

While its oil reserves in the North Sea are of little importance, the Netherlands have an estimated 25% of natural gas reserves in the EU. Natural gas reserves of the Netherlands are estimated (as of 2014) to be about 600 billion cubic feet, or about 0.3% of the world total. In 2014–2015 the government decided to reduce the production of gas in the province Groningen significantly due to problems of sinking ground, differential settlement levels and tremors (small earth quakes) causing damages to properties, end 2018 the government decided to completely abandon the gas production in the province of Groningen by reducing the production slightly each year, the production was expected to come to a halt entirely by 2028. On June 23, 2023, the government decided to close the remaining five production facilities as of October 1, 2023. The possibility of reopening one or more facilities is being kept open, citing the uncertain international situation and possibly very cold weather as possible reasons for this. All wells will be permanently closed and dismantled as of October 1, 2024. 

To reduce its greenhouse emissions, the government of the Netherlands is subsidizing a transition away from natural gas for all homes in the country by 2050. In the Netherlands, 98% of enterprises are reducing greenhouse gas emissions, beating the EU average of 89%. However, only 48% of Dutch firms set and monitor their own emission targets. Dutch enterprises mostly cut emissions through waste reduction or recycling (86%), as well as energy efficiency programmes (76%).

In the Netherlands, 78% of enterprises have invested in reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the impact of weather disasters as of 2023. Six out of ten (60%) plan to invest in these areas during the next three years. The numbers for &#x27;already invested&#x27; and &#x27;intend to invest&#x27; above the EU average (56% and 54%, respectively). The largest invested is in trash reduction or recycling (86% of Dutch firms).

Dutch companies are more likely to see the transition to stronger climate laws as an opportunity (39% vs 23% from other European firms).

=== Nuclear energy ===

Researchers in the Netherlands began studying nuclear energy in the 1930s and began construction of research reactor Dodewaard in 1955. Researchers’ goal was to introduce nuclear power technology by 1962 and replace fossil fuels. In 1968, a test nuclear reactor was attached to the power grid. This unit was shut down in 1997. In the 1970s, the Dutch chose a policy that required reprocessing all spent nuclear fuel. In 1984, the government decided to create a long-term (100 years) storage facility for all intermediate and low-level radioactive waste and research strategies for ultimate disposal. In September 2003, the Central Organization for Radioactive Waste created an interim storage facility for high-level waste. The Netherlands&#x27; only commercial nuclear reactor is Borssele, which became operational in 1973 and produces about 4% of the country&#x27;s electricity. The older Dodewaard nuclear power plant was a test reactor that later got attached to the national grid but was closed in 1997. A 2MW research reactor known as Reactor Institute Delft (RID) is located in Delft, as part of the physics department of Delft University of Technology. This reactor is not meant for energy provision but used as a neutron and positron source for research.

In 1994, the States General of the Netherlands voted to phase out nuclear power after a discussion of nuclear waste management. In 1997, the power station at Dodewaard was shut down and the government decided it was planning to end Borssele&#x27;s operating license in 2003. This has since been postponed to 2034, if it complied with the highest safety standards. After the 2010 election, the new government was open to expanding nuclear power. Both of the companies that share ownership of Borssele are proposing to build new reactors. In January 2012, Delta announced it postpones any decision to start building a second nuclear power plant.

==Tourism==
In 2011, the Netherlands was visited by 11.3 million foreign tourists. In 2012, the Dutch tourism industry contributed 5.4% in total to the country&#x27;s GDP and 9.6% in total to its employment. With its global ranking of 147th and 83rd place for total contribution to respectively GDP and employment, tourism is a relatively small sector of the Dutch economy. North Holland was by far the most popular province for foreign tourists in 2011. Out of all 11.3 million tourists, 6 million visited North Holland. South Holland took the second place with 1.4 million. Germans, Britons and Belgians made up the majority of foreign tourists, respectively 3, 1.5 and 1.4 million. As of 2020, there are nine World Heritage Sites in the Netherlands. The Netherlands are well known for their art and rich historical heritage.

== Data ==
The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027). Inflation under 5% is in green. 

== Companies ==
In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Netherlands is Services with 761,749 companies followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate and Retail Trade with 693,255 and 101,025 companies respectively.

In the Netherlands, 91% of enterprises say they have invested appropriately during the past three years (2023 - 2020). This beats the EU average at 82%. Compared to other enterprises in the EU, Dutch firms prioritise new goods or services (26% vs. 34% for replacement). In keeping with the EU average of 10%, just 7% of enterprises in the Netherlands do not plan to invest. Dutch companies were hurt by the energy crisis in 2022 - 2023, albeit to a lower extent than those elsewhere in the EU. While most companies are concerned about energy prices, just 30% consider it a critical issue. This is half of the EU average (59%).

Dutch firms face significant long-term hurdles to investment, including a lack of trained people (71%), and high energy prices (66%). Barriers are diminishing, with numbers lower than the EU average and than 2021. For example, the availability of funding is less of an impediment than across the EU (23% versus 44%).

In 2023, one in ten Dutch enterprises (13%) brought new goods, processes, or services to the Dutch or global market. Majority of Dutch firms are also more technologically oriented than EU peers - almost eight out of ten Dutch firms (78%) employed at least one digital technology in 2023. The EU average is 70%. The majority of Dutch firms utilise digital platform technologies (59%), robots (56%), and the Internet of Things (55%), whereas just a small percentage use 3D printing (19%) or augmented/VR technology (15%).

== Largest companies ==

The Netherlands is home to several large multinationals including Heineken, Ahold, Philips, TomTom, Randstad NV and ING, all of which have their headquarters in Amsterdam. Thousands of companies of non-Dutch origin have their headquarters in the Netherlands, like EADS, LyondellBasell and IKEA, because of attractive corporate tax levels.

The Netherlands&#x27; biggest companies in the Fortune Global 500 as of 2022 are as following:

== Mergers and acquisitions ==
In the Netherlands 22,484 deals were conducted between 1985 and 2018, with an overall value of 2,226.6 billion USD. The year with the most deals was 2000, with 1,169 deals. The year with the highest overall value was 2007, with almost 394.9 billion USD. However this was followed by a drastic slump during the Great Recession.

<doc id="59761" wikidata="Q877631" url="?curid=59761" title="Politics of the Netherlands">
<text>The Netherlands is a parliamentary representative democracy. A constitutional monarchy, the country is organised as a decentralised unitary state. The Netherlands can be described as a consociational state. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by a common striving for broad consensus on important issues, within both of the political community and society as a whole.

==Constitution== 
The Dutch Constitution lists the basic civil and social rights of the Dutch citizens and it describes the position and function of the institutions that have executive, legislative and judiciary power.

The constitution applies to the Netherlands, one of the four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands comprises all of the European territory, as well as the Caribbean islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba. The Kingdom as a whole (the Netherlands along with Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten) has its own Statute, describing its federate political system. 

The Netherlands does not have a constitutional court and judges do not have the authority to review laws on their constitutionality. International treaties and the Statute of the Kingdom, however, overrule Dutch law and the Constitution, and judges are allowed to review laws against these in a particular court case. Furthermore, all legislation that is not a law in the strict sense of the word (such as policy guidelines or laws proposed by provincial or municipal government) can be tested on its constitutionality.

Amendments to the Constitution must be approved by both Houses of the States General () twice. The first time around, this requires a majority vote. After parliament has been dissolved and a general election has been held, both Houses must approve the proposed amendments again with a two-thirds majority.

== Political institutions ==
Major political institutions are the monarchy, the cabinet, the States General and the judicial system. There are three other High Colleges of State, which stand on an equal footing with parliament but have a less political role, of which the Council of State is the most important. Other levels of government are the municipalities, the water boards and the provinces. Although not mentioned in the Constitution, political parties and the social partners organised in the Social and Economic Council are important political institutions as well.

The Netherlands does not have a traditional separation of powers; according to the Constitution, the States General and the government (the monarch and the ministers) share legislative power. All legislation has to pass through the Council of State () for advice and the Social and Economic Council advises the government on most socio-economic legislation. Executive power is reserved for the government. The Social and Economic Council also has the special right to make and enforce legislation in specific sectors, mostly in agriculture. The judicial power is divided into two separate systems of courts. For civil and criminal law the independent Supreme Court is the highest court, while for administrative law the Council of State is the highest court, which is &quot;ex officio&quot; chaired by the monarch.

===Monarchy===
The present monarchy was founded in 1813. After the expulsion of the French, the Prince of Orange was proclaimed Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands. The new monarchy was confirmed in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna as part of the re-arrangement of Europe after the fall of Napoleon. The House of Orange-Nassau was given the present-day Netherlands and Belgium to govern as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Between 1815 and 1890, the King of the Netherlands was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg.

The current monarch is Willem-Alexander, while the heir apparent is Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange.

Constitutionally, the monarch is head of state and has a role in the legislative process, as he has to co-sign every law to make it valid. The monarch is also &quot;ex officio&quot; chair of the Council of State, which advises the cabinet on every piece of legislation and is the final court for administrative law. Although King Willem-Alexander takes these functions seriously, he refrains from exerting his power in these positions. Until 2012, the monarch also played a central role in the formation of a cabinet after a general election or a cabinet crisis. The monarch used to appoint the &quot;informateur&quot;, who chairs the formation talks, after consulting the parliamentary leaders of all parties represented in the lower house of the States General. Because this advice was a matter of public record, the monarch could not easily take a direction that was contrary to the advice of a majority in parliament. On the other hand, what was actually talked about behind the closed doors of the palace was not known. Upon the conclusion of formation talks, the monarch appoints the cabinet. Upon the fall of a government, the Prime Minister has to request the monarch to dismiss the cabinet.

===Cabinet===
The government of the Netherlands (&quot;regering&quot;) constitutionally consists of the monarch and the ministers. The monarch only plays a role in the appointment of ministers, and is not involved in decision-making. The ministers collectively form the Council of Ministers. This executive council meets every Friday in the &quot;Trêveszaal&quot; at the Binnenhof, and initiates laws and policy. While most of the ministers head government ministries, since 1939 it has been permissible to appoint ministers without portfolio. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands presides over the cabinet and is the most important political figure of the Dutch government.

The national government ( or ) consists of ministries, the implementing organizations that fall under the responsibility of ministries, inspectorates, and High Councils of State, and is involved in the preparation and implementation of the plans of the government and parliament.

Some of the most highly regarded Prime Ministers of the Netherlands include:
===States General===
The Dutch Parliament, officially known as the States General of the Netherlands, consists of a House of Representatives (&quot;Tweede Kamer&quot;) and a Senate (&quot;Eerste Kamer&quot;). Both chambers are housed in the Binnenhof in The Hague and discuss proposed legislation and review the actions of the cabinet. Only the House of Representatives has the right to propose or amend legislation while the Senate discusses its value regarding the Dutch law since the Netherlands has no constitutional court. Currently there are 150 members of the House of Representatives and 75 Senators.

Members of the House are elected directly every four years using party-list proportional representation. Representatives are chosen on personal title, so when a member no longer agrees with his or her party, the member can decide to stay in the chamber, either as an independent representative, or as a member of another parliamentary party. If a member decides to resign, the empty seat falls to the original party collecting the votes, and is offered to the highest placed candidate on the party&#x27;s electoral list who was not elected. Coalition governments may fall before their term expires, which usually results in early dissolution of the House and new elections.

Members of the Senate are elected indirectly by provincial councilors, again every four years, just after the elections of the provincial councils, via a system of proportional representation. Nowadays, the Senate is mainly considered to be a body of elder statesmen reconsidering legislation at ease, away from the pressure of daily political and media hypes. The position of senator is a part-time job as the institution meets once a week.

===Political parties===

The system of proportional representation, combined with the historical social division between Catholics, Protestants, socialists and liberals, has resulted in a multiparty system. The parties currently represented in the Dutch House of Representatives are:

* The Party for Freedom (PVV), a nationalist conservative, right populist, and anti-Islam party founded and dominated by Geert Wilders, formerly of the VVD. Its philosophy is based on maintaining the integrity of Dutch culture, and opposing immigration and European integration. Mostly economically liberal.
* GroenLinks–PvdA, a political alliance of GroenLinks and the Labour Party. The party combines centre-left social democratic politics and green environmentalist ideals. It focuses on issues such as climate change, employment, social security and healthcare with traditional left-wing elements. 
* The People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), a conservative liberal party. It has more sympathy for private enterprise and economic freedom compared to other parties. The VVD has supported prioritising security over civil liberties. While VVD is more market liberal, split party D66 profiles more social liberal stance and leans more to left.
* New Social Contract (NSC), a christian democratic party founded in 2023 after Pieter Omtzigt split from the CDA two years earlier.
* Democrats 66 (D66), a centre to centre-left social liberal party. The party supports liberal policies on social issues such as abortion, drugs, euthanasia and stands for human rights and LGBT progress. D66 is also a strong supporter of European integration. The party supports secularism, EU integration, and is relatively supportive of civil liberties and privacy.
* Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) is a centre-right to right-wing party that has its roots in agrarianism and rural development.
* The Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), a centre to centre-right Christian democratic and moderately conservative party. It holds to the principle that government activity should supplement but not supplant communal action by citizens. The CDA puts its philosophy between the &quot;individualism&quot; of the VVD and the &quot;statism&quot; of the PvdA.
* The Socialist Party (SP), in its first years was a radical-socialist and communist party, a maoist split from the Communist Party Netherlands. It is now a socialist party advocating democratic socialism, rejecting the privatisation of public services and advocating increased social welfare and socialised education and safety.
* DENK, a small political party mainly focusing on and promoting multiculturalism and social integration. The party also supports environmentalism and international justice.
* The Party for the Animals is an animal rights party, that is often considered a one issue-party, although it claims not to be. The focus of the party is on animal welfare, protecting the environment and conservation. The party also has left-wing positions regarding education, privacy, healthcare and the economy.
* Forum for Democracy (FvD), a right-wing, nationalist conservative party. In favour of lower taxes, promoting environmental sustainability (while questioning mankind&#x27;s influence on climate change), military investment and expansion, electoral reform, offering a referendum on European Union membership, reinstating border controls and ending what it perceives as mass immigration.
* The Reformed Political Party (SGP), an explicitly religious, radically conservative and theocratic Protestant party. It is a testimonial party. Only in 2006 and after heavy political pressure were women allowed to be members of this party. Reliably earns 2 or 3 out of 150 seats in parliament.
* The Christian Union, a Christian democratic and conservative party made up by mostly orthodox Protestant Christians, with conservative stances on abortion, euthanasia and same-sex marriage. In other areas the party is considered centre-left, for instance on immigration, the welfare state and the environment.
* Volt Netherlands, the Dutch branch of the pan-European socially and economically liberal Volt Europa movement advocating pro-Europeanism and European federalism and large civil liberties.
* JA21, a conservative liberal party that emerged after internal conflicts in Forum for Democracy. The party is influenced by the ideas of right-wing politician Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated in 2002, promoting stricter immigration policies, entrepreneurship and more individual freedoms.

===Council of State===
The Council of State is an advisory body of cabinet on constitutional and judicial aspects of legislation and policy. All proposed legislation is sent to the Council of State for advice. Although the advice is not binding, the cabinet is required to respond to the advice and it often plays a significant role in the ensuing debate in Parliament. In addition, the Council is the highest administrative court.

The Council is &quot;ex officio&quot; chaired by the monarch. The probable heir to the throne becomes a member of the Council when reaching legal adulthood. The monarch leaves daily affairs to the Vice-President of the Council of State, currently Thom de Graaf, and the other councillors, who are mainly legal specialists, former ministers, members of parliament and judges or professors of law.

===High Councils of State===
The Dutch political system has five so-called High Councils of State, which are explicitly regarded as independent by the Constitution. Apart from the two Houses of Parliament and the Council of State, these are the Court of Audit and the National Ombudsman.

The Court of Audit investigates whether public funds are collected and spent legitimately and effectively. The National Ombudsman investigates complaints about the functioning and practices of government. As with the advice of the Council of State, the reports from these organisations are not easily put aside and often play a role in public and political debate.

===Judicial system===

The judiciary comprises eleven district courts, four courts of appeal, three administrative courts of appeal (Central Appeals Tribunal, Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal and Council of State) and the Supreme Court. All judicial appointments are made by the Government. Judges are appointed for life until they retire at the age of 70.

===Advisory councils===
As part of the Dutch tradition of depoliticised consensus-based decision making, the government often makes use of advisory councils composed of academic specialists or representatives of stakeholders.

The most prominent advisory council is the Social and Economic Council (, SER), which is composed of representatives of trade unions and employers&#x27; organisations, along with government-appointed specialists. It is consulted at an early stage in financial, economic and social policy-making. It advises government and its advice, like the advice of the High Councils of State, cannot easily be set aside. The SER heads a system of PBOs, self-regulating organisations that contribute to making laws for specific economic sectors.

The following organisations are represented in the Social and Economic Council, accounting for two thirds of its membership:
*the left-wing Federation of Dutch Trade Unions,
*the Christian National Trade Union Federation
*the trade union for managerial staff, the Trade Union Federation for Professionals,
*the employers&#x27; organisation VNO-NCW,
*the employers&#x27; organisation for small and medium-sized enterprises MKB-Nederland, and
*the employers&#x27; organisation for farmers LTO Nederland.

The remaining third of the members of the council are appointed by the government. These include professors of economics and related fields, as well as representatives of the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis and De Nederlandsche Bank. In addition, representatives of environmental and consumers&#x27; organisations are represented in SER working groups.

Other prominent advisory bodies are
*the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, which forecasts economic development,
*Statistics Netherlands, which studies and reports on social and economic developments,
*The Netherlands Institute for Social Research, which studies long-term social and cultural trends,
*the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, which advises the government on environmental and health issues, and
*the Scientific Council for Government Policy, which advises the government on long-term social, political and economic trends.

===Subnational government===
The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces, which are responsible for spatial planning, health policy and recreation, within the bounds prescribed by the national government. Furthermore, they oversee the policy and finances of municipalities and water boards. Provincial councils are directly elected by inhabitants every four years. Executive authority is exercised by the King&#x27;s (or Queens&#x27;s) commissioner and the College of the provincial executive. The commissioner is appointed by the national government and is responsible to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. Members of the provincial executive are appointed by, and responsible to the provincial council.

Local government in the Netherlands is formed by 342 municipalities (as of 2023). Municipalities are responsible for education, spatial planning and social security, within the bounds prescribed by the national and provincial government. Like provincial councils, municipal councils are directly elected every four years. Municipalities are governed by the municipal executive, consisting of the mayor and a number of aldermen. The mayor is appointed by the national government and responsible to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. The aldermen are appointed by, and responsible to the municipal council. The major cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam are subdivided into administrative areas (stadsdelen), which have their own (limited) responsibilities.

Local government on the Caribbean Netherlands is formed by three public bodies sometimes called &quot;special municipalities&quot; which are not part of a province. They are governed by a Lieutenant-general () and &quot;eilandgedeputeerden&quot; which are responsible to the island council, which is elected by direct suffrage. Their activities are similar to but wider than those of municipalities.

Furthermore, there are water boards which are responsible for the country&#x27;s inland waterways, groundwater levels, polders, dikes and other waterworks. These boards are ruled by representatives of companies, farmers and nature conservation organisations and representatives who are elected by citizens in the area. They have the power to tax their residents.

==Policy==

===Foreign policy===
The foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to Transatlantic relations, European integration, international development and international law. While historically the Netherlands used to be a neutral state, it has joined many international organisations since World War II, most prominently the United Nations, NATO and the European Union. The Dutch economy is very open and heavily reliant on international trade. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs.

===Policy issues===
Dutch policies on recreational drugs, prostitution, same-sex marriage, abortion and euthanasia are among the most liberal in the world.

==Political history==

===1800–1966===
The Netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1813 and a parliamentary democracy since 1848. Previously, it was a republic from 1581 to 1806, and a kingdom between 1806 and 1810 (it was part of France between 1810 and 1813).

Before 1917, the Netherlands had a two-round system with census suffrage (per the Constitution of 1814), in which only property-owning adult males had the right to vote. Under influence of the rising socialist movement the requirements were gradually reduced until in 1917 the present party-list proportional representation voting system with universal manhood suffrage was instituted, expanded in 1919 to include women.

Until 1966, Dutch politics was characterised by pillarisation. Society was separated into several segments (pillars) which lived separately from each other and there was only contact at the top levels, in government. These pillars had their own organisations, most importantly the political parties. There were four pillars, which provided the five most important parties, the socialist Labour Party (PvdA), the conservative liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) and the two conservative Protestant parties, the Christian Historical Union (CHU) and the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP). Since no party ever won an absolute majority, these political parties had to work together in coalition governments. These alternated between a centre-left &quot;Roman/Red&quot; coalition of PvdA, KVP, ARP and CHU and a centre-right coalition of VVD, KVP, ARP and CHU.

===1966–1994===
In the 1960s, new parties appeared, which were mostly popular with young voters, who felt less bound to the pillars. The post-war babyboom meant that there had been a demographic shift to lower ages. On top of that, the voting age was lowered, first from 23 to 21 years in 1963 and then to 18 years in 1972. The most successful new party was the progressive liberal Democrats 66 (D66), which proposed democratisation to break down pillarisation.

Pillarisation declined, with the three Christian democratic parties losing almost half of their votes. In 1977 they merged into the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), which became a major force in Dutch politics, participating in governments uninterruptedly from 1977 until 1994. Meanwhile, the conservative liberal VVD and D66 made large electoral gains.

The Dutch welfare state had become the most extensive social security system in the world by the early eighties, but it came into crisis when spending rose due to dramatic high unemployment rates and poor economic growth. The early eighties saw unemployment rise to over 11% and the budget deficit rose to 10.7% of the national income. The centre-right and centre-left coalitions of CDA–VVD and CDA–PvdA reformed the Dutch welfare state to bring the budget deficit under control and to create jobs. Social benefits were reduced, taxes lowered and businesses deregulated. Gradually the economy recovered and the budget deficit and unemployment were reduced considerably.

When the far-left parties lost much electoral support in the 1986 elections, they decided to merge into the new GroenLinks in 1989, with considerable success.

===Since 1994===
In the 1994 general election, the CDA lost nearly half its seats, while D66 doubled in size. For the first time in eighty years, a coalition was formed without the Christian democrats. The purple coalition was formed between PvdA, D66 and VVD. The colour purple symbolised the mixing of socialist red with liberal blue. During the purple years, which lasted until 2002, the government introduced legislation on abortion, euthanasia, and gay marriage. The purple coalition also marked a period of remarkable economic prosperity.

Since 2000, the Netherlands has largely supported the European Union and taken marked steps to integrate itself with it and improve its ties with NATO. Globalization, the introduction of the Euro, the enlargement of the European Union, the enlargement of NATO, the aftermath of the Orange Revolution and other factors have contributed to that.

The purple coalition lost its majority in the 2002 general election due to the rise of the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF), the new political party led by the flamboyant populist Pim Fortuyn. He campaigned on an anti-immigration programme and spoke of the &quot;Purple Chaos&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Puinhopen van Paars&quot;). Fortuyn was shot dead nine days before the elections. The LPF entered the House of Representatives with one-sixth of the seats, while the PvdA lost half its seats. A cabinet was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, led by Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende. It proved short-lived: after only 87 days in power, the coalition fell apart as a result of consecutive conflicts within the LPF and between LPF ministers.

In the ensuing January 2003 general election, the LPF dropped to only five percent of the seats in the House of Representatives. The left-wing Socialist Party (SP) led by Jan Marijnissen became the fourth strongest party there. The centre-right second Balkenende cabinet was formed by the CDA, the VVD, and the D66. Against popular sentiment, the right-wing coalition initiated a programme of welfare state reforms, healthcare privatisation, and stricter immigration policies. On 1 June 2005, the Dutch electorate voted in a referendum against the proposed European Constitution by a majority of 61.54%, three days after 57.67% of the French voters had rejected the treaty.

In June 2006, D66 withdrew its support for the coalition in the aftermath of the upheaval about the asylum procedure of Ayaan Hirsi Ali instigated by immigration minister Rita Verdonk. As a result, the caretaker third Balkenende cabinet was formed by CDA and VVD. The ensuing November 2006 general election saw a major advance of the SP, which almost tripled in size and became the third largest party with 17% of the seats, while the moderate PvdA lost a quarter of its seats. At the other end of the spectrum, LPF lost all its seats, while the new anti-immigrant Party for Freedom (PVV) went from nothing to 6% of the seats, becoming the fifth largest party. This polarisation made the formation negotiations very difficult. The talks resulted in the formation of the social-Christian fourth Balkenende cabinet supported by CDA, PvdA, and the Christian Union. This cabinet was oriented at solidarity, durability, and &quot;norms and values&quot;.

In February 2010, the PvdA withdrew its support for the fourth Balkenende cabinet. The PvdA disagreed with prolonging the Dutch military involvement in Afghanistan. In the following 2010 general election, the VVD became the biggest party with 31 seats, followed closely by the PvdA with 30 seats. The right-wing PVV went from 9 to 24 seats, while the CDA lost half of their support and was left with 21 seats. The SP lost 10 of its 25 seats, and both D66 and GroenLinks got 10 seats. The Christian Union, the smallest coalition party, lost 1 of its 6 seats. Both the SGP and the PvdD kept their 2 seats. The following cabinet formation eventually resulted in the first Rutte cabinet, a minority government formed by VVD and CDA, supported in parliament by the PVV.

In April 2012, the PVV withdrew its support for the Rutte cabinet after failed negotiations about the government budget for 2013. A political crisis followed, in which the parliamentary fractions of the VVD, CDA, D66, GroenLinks and the Christian Union, together disposing of a parliamentary majority, came to a temporary agreement for the 2013 budget. What followed in September 2012 was the 2012 general election, in which both the VVD and the PvdA won considerably, gaining 41 and 38 seats respectively.

The three parties that lost most were the PVV, sinking from 24 to 15 seats, the CDA, continuing their 2010 loss and winning only 13 seats, and GroenLinks, sinking from 10 to only 4 seats. The SP (15 seats), Christian Union (5 seats) and PvdD (2 seats) were stable, whereas D66 (10 to 12 seats) and SGP (2 to 3 seats) won mildly. Newcomer was 50PLUS, a pensioners&#x27; party, gaining 2 seats. In November 2012, after a relatively short cabinet formation, the second Rutte cabinet was formed by VVD and PvdA.

The second Rutte cabinet was followed by the third Rutte cabinet in October 2017, after the 2017 general election. It consisted of the VVD, CDA, D66 and CU.

In 2019, protests commenced with thousands of Dutch farmers who consider that &quot;green policies&quot; are a threat to their livelihood due to nitrogen consumption being limited and other policies which impose additional burdens on the ability to farm.

On 15 January 2021, the Rutte cabinet resigned in the face of the Dutch childcare benefits scandal. In March 2021, centre-right VVD of Prime Minister Mark Rutte was the winner of the elections, securing 35 out of 150 seats. The second biggest party was the centre to centre-left D66 with 24 seats. Geert Wilders&#x27; radical-right party lost a few seats, while Thierry Baudet&#x27;s radical-right party Forum for Democracy grew. The ensuing fourth Rutte cabinet failed to reach a compromise on asylum policy and fell in July 2023, triggering November snap election. The right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, won the largest number of seats, and it formed the right-wing Schoof cabinet.

The Netherlands were in 2023 considered the 17th most electoral democratic country in the world according to the V-Dem Democracy indices.

Wirth served as a vice president of Great Western Cities Company, part of Great Western United, in 1970–1971. The CEO of GWU was William M. White Jr., age 31, in 1971, when Wirth described White and Wirth reading &quot;Future Shock&quot; and passing copies to the &quot;older generation&quot; of company directors.

==Career==
Wirth began his political career as a White House Fellow under President Lyndon Johnson and was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Education in the Nixon Administration. In 1970, Wirth returned to Colorado and ran successfully for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974, unseating incumbent Republican Donald G. Brotzman by a 52% to 48% margin. He represented Boulder and the Denver suburbs in Congress from 1975 to 1987. As a first term Congressman, Wirth organized the &quot;Freshman Revolt&quot; in 1975 unseating a handful of &quot;old bull&quot; committee chairmen, and encouraging others to be more inclusive. Wirth had a number of difficult reelections during his 12 years in Congress, and raised large sums of money to get reelected. With colleagues Norman Mineta, Leon Panetta and Dick Gephardt, he was part of &quot;The Gang of Four&quot; on the House Budget Committee challenging the budget process with bipartisan budget ideas, and developing a high technology and alternative budget in 1982. As Chair of the Telecommunications Subcommittee, he was the lead legislator in bringing competition to the video and telephone industries. Wirth also authored the Indian Peaks Wilderness Act of 1978.
In 1986, Wirth ran for the U.S. Senate and on his party&#x27;s nomination unopposed to replace Sen. Gary Hart. The general election was more difficult than expected, and he defeated fellow U.S. Representative Ken Kramer by a narrow margin. In the Senate, he focused on environmental issues, particularly global climate change, and organized the historic Hansen hearings on climate change in 1988. At the hearings, Hansen testified that the Earth is warmer than at any other time in recent history, and that this can be attributed to human activity with 99% certainty. The hearings are widely credited with first bringing climate change into the public discourse. With his close friend, the late Senator John Heinz (R-PA), he authored &quot;Project 88&quot;, outlining the groundbreaking &quot;Cap and Trade&quot; idea which became law in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. He authored the far-reaching Colorado Wilderness Bill which became law in 1993, and with Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) he authored major legislation focused on population stabilization. Wirth also organized the Senate Task Force on the Expansion of Major League Baseball, which became a major factor in the awarding of a new expansion franchise to Denver. He chose not to run for re-election in 1992, citing in a front page cover story in the Sunday New York Times Magazine (August 9, 1992), frustration with the ever-increasing role of money in politics to the exclusion of focus on public policy.

===After Congressional service===

Following two decades of elected politics, Wirth was national co-chair of the Clinton–Gore campaign, and served in the U.S. Department of State as the first Undersecretary for Global Affairs from 1993 to 1997. He led U.S. foreign policy in the areas of refugees, population, environment, science, human rights and narcotics. He chaired the United States Delegation at the 1994 Cairo Conference on Population and Development, and was the lead U.S. negotiator for the Kyoto Climate Conference until he resigned from the Administration in late 1997 to accept Ted Turner&#x27;s invitation to be President of the newly created United Nations Foundation.
As President of the UN Foundation (UNF) from 1998 to 2013, Wirth organized and led the formulation of the Foundation&#x27;s mission and program priorities, which include the environment, women and population, children&#x27;s health, and peace, security and human rights. The Foundation also engages in extensive public advocacy, fundraising, and institutional strengthening efforts on behalf of the United Nations. By mobilizing these diverse resources, the UN Foundation works with many public and private partners and manages a variety of campaigns to help solve major problems facing the UN and the world community.

The University of Colorado at Denver has an endowed Tim Wirth Chair in Environmental and Community Development Policy. The current holder of the chair is the man Wirth replaced in the Senate, Gary Hart.

Wirth is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

In his retirement, Wirth has been supportive of the youth climate justice movement. He has been active in efforts to convince his alma mater, Harvard University, to divest from fossil fuels, and in March 2021 joined Harvard students, faculty, and alumni to file an official legal complaint charging that the university&#x27;s fossil fuel investments were illegal under Massachusetts law. In response to the legal complaint and other efforts, Harvard committed to divestment from fossil fuels in the fall of 2021.

== Personal life ==
Wirth is married to Wren Winslow Wirth, the president of the Winslow Foundation. They have two children, Chris and Kelsey Wirth. Their daughter, Kelsey Wirth, is the co-founder of the orthodontic production company Align Technology. Their son, Chris Wirth, is the founder of Liberty Puzzles, the largest American laser-cut jigsaw puzzle company, based in Boulder, Colorado. His nephew, Peter Wirth, was elected to the New Mexico Legislature in 2004. His father, the late John Wirth, was the Gildred Professor of Latin American Studies at Stanford University.

<doc id="59765" wikidata="Q12973" url="?curid=59765" title="Leopold III of Belgium">
<text>Leopold III (3 November 1901 – 25 September 1983) was King of the Belgians from 23 February 1934 until his abdication on 16 July 1951. At the outbreak of World War II, Leopold tried to maintain Belgian neutrality, but after the German invasion in May 1940, he surrendered his country, earning him much hostility, both at home and abroad.

Leopold&#x27;s act was declared unconstitutional by Prime Minister Hubert Pierlot and his cabinet, who moved to London to form a government-in-exile, while Leopold and his family were placed under house arrest. In 1944, they were moved to Germany and then Austria, before being liberated by the Americans, but banned for some years from returning to Belgium, where his brother Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, had been declared regent. Leopold&#x27;s eventual return to his homeland in 1950 nearly caused a civil war, with serious calls for a secessionist republic in Wallonia. Under pressure from the government, he abdicated in favour of his son Baudouin in July 1951.

Leopold&#x27;s first wife, Astrid of Sweden, died in a road accident while on a driving holiday in Switzerland in August 1935, being much mourned by the public. Leopold, who was driving the vehicle when it hit a tree, was also lightly injured. His morganatic second marriage, to Lilian Baels in captivity in 1941, was contrary to Belgian law, which stipulates that the civil marriage has to occur before a religious marriage, and she was never permitted the title of queen. Although Lilian and Leopold had originally planned to postpone their civil marriage until the end of the war, Lilian was soon expecting their first child, necessitating a civil marriage, which took place on 6 December 1941.

==Early life and family==

Prince Leopold was born in Brussels, the first child of Prince Albert, heir to the Belgian throne, and his consort, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria. In 1909 his father became King of the Belgians, as Albert I, and Prince Leopold became Duke of Brabant.

In August 1914, when Belgium was invaded by Germany, King Albert allowed Leopold, then aged twelve, to enlist in the Belgian army as a private and fight in defence of the kingdom. However, in 1915, with Belgium almost entirely occupied by the Germans, Leopold was sent to attend Eton College, while his father fought on in France.

After the war, in 1919, the Duke of Brabant visited the Old Mission and Saint Anthony Seminary in Santa Barbara, California.

He married Princess Astrid of Sweden in a civil ceremony in Stockholm on 4 November 1926, followed by a religious ceremony in Brussels on 10 November. The marriage produced three children:
* Princess Joséphine Charlotte of Belgium, born at the Royal Palace of Brussels on 11 October 1927, Grand Duchess consort of Luxembourg. She was married on 9 April 1953 to Prince Jean, later Grand Duke of Luxembourg. She died at Fischbach Castle on 10 January 2005.
* Prince Baudouin of Belgium, Duke of Brabant, Count of Hainaut, who became the fifth King of the Belgians as Baudouin, born at Stuyvenberg on the outskirts of Brussels on 7 September 1930, and died at Motril in Andalusia, Spain, on 31 July 1993.
* Prince Albert of Belgium, Prince of Liège, who became the sixth King of the Belgians as Albert II, born at Stuyvenberg on 6 June 1934. He abdicated in July 2013.

On 29 August 1935, while the king and queen were driving along the winding, narrow roads near their villa at Küssnacht am Rigi, Schwyz, Switzerland, on the shores of Lake Lucerne, Leopold lost control of the car which plunged into the lake, killing Queen Astrid.

Leopold married Lilian Baels on 11 September 1941, in a secret religious ceremony which was not valid under the law of Belgium. They originally intended to wait until the end of the war for the civil marriage, but as the new &quot;Princess of Réthy&quot; was soon expecting their first child, the ceremony took place on 6 December 1941. They had three children in total:

* Prince Alexandre of Belgium, born in Brussels on 18 July 1942. In 1991, he married Léa Wolman, a marriage revealed only seven years later. He died on 29 November 2009.
* , born in Brussels on 6 February 1951. Her first marriage, to Paul Drucker in 1981, lasted 40 days (they were formally divorced in 1985). She later married Jean-Paul Gourges in 1989.
* Princess Marie-Esméralda of Belgium, later Lady Moncada, born in Brussels on 30 September 1956. She became a journalist; her professional name is Esmeralda de Réthy. She married pharmacologist Sir Salvador Moncada in 1998. They have a son and a daughter.

==World War II==

When World War II broke out in September 1939, the French and British governments immediately sought to persuade Belgium to join them. Leopold and his government refused, maintaining Belgium&#x27;s neutrality. Belgium considered itself well-prepared against a possible invasion by Axis forces, for during the 1930s the Belgian government had made extensive preparations to deter and repel an invasion of the country by Germany such as the one that had occurred in 1914.

On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht invaded Belgium. On the first day of the offensive, the principal Belgian strong point of Fort Eben-Emael was overwhelmed by a daring paratroop operation and the defensive perimeter thus penetrated before any French or British troops could arrive. After a short running battle that eventually involved the armies of all four belligerents, Belgium was overwhelmed by the numerically superior and better-prepared Germans.

Nevertheless, the Belgian perseverance prevented the British Expeditionary Force from being outflanked and cut off from the coast, enabling the evacuation from Dunkirk. Alan Brooke who commanded II Corps of the BEF thought that the 10th Belgian Division was in the wrong place and wanted to deploy north of Brussels to avoid &quot;double-banking&quot;. He was advised by Roger Keyes to see the king, and on 12 May was &quot;making progress in getting matters put right&quot; in discussion with the king in English, but was interrupted (twice) by the king&#x27;s advisor who spoke to the king in French (in which Brooke was fluent). The advisor was insistent that the Belgian division could not be moved and the BEF should be stopped further south and clear of Brussels; Brooke said he was not putting the whole case to the king; he found that arguing with the advisor was a sheer waste of time as he cared little about the BEF and most of his suggestions were &quot;fantastic&quot;. The king&#x27;s advisor Raoul Van Overstraeten was not the Chief of Staff, as Brooke had assumed - Van Overstraeten had refused that rank - but the king&#x27;s aide-de-camp, with the rank of Major-General, and would not give up the Louvain front. The French liaison officer, General Champon, told Brooke that Van Overstraeten had ascendancy over the king and had taken control, so it was useless to see the Chief of Staff. Later (15 May) Brooke found that the BEF was likely to &quot;have both flanks turned&quot; with French defeats, and started withdrawal on 16 May.

After his military surrender, Leopold (unlike Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in a similar predicament) remained in Brussels to surrender to the victorious invaders, while his entire civil government fled to Paris and later to London.

===Surrender and constitutional crisis===

On 24 May 1940, Leopold, having assumed command of the Belgian Army, met with his ministers for the final time. The ministers urged the king to leave the country with the government. Prime Minister Hubert Pierlot reminded him that capitulation was a decision for the Belgian government, not for the king, to make. The king indicated that he had decided to remain in Belgium with his troops, whatever the outcome. The ministers took this to mean that he would establish a new government under the direction of Hitler, potentially a treasonous act. Leopold thought that he might be seen as a deserter if he were to leave the country: &quot;He was resolved to remain with his army and amidst his people so as to share their fate. Leopold had long had a difficult and contentious relationship with his ministers, acting independently of government influence whenever possible, and seeking to circumvent and even limit the ministers&#x27; powers, while expanding his own.

French, British, and Belgian troops were encircled by German forces at the Battle of Dunkirk. Leopold notified King George VI by telegram on 25 May 1940 that Belgian forces were being crushed, saying &quot;assistance which we give to the Allies will come to an end if our army is surrounded&quot;. Two days later (27 May 1940), Leopold surrendered the Belgian forces to the Germans.

Prime Minister Pierlot spoke on French radio, saying that the king&#x27;s decision to surrender went against the Belgian Constitution. The decision, he said, was not only a military decision but also a political decision, and the king had acted without his ministers&#x27; advice, and therefore contrary to the Constitution. Pierlot and his Government believed this created an &quot;impossibilité de régner&quot;:

It was impossible, however, to summon the Belgian Chamber of Representatives or Belgian Senate at this time, or to appoint a regent. After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, the government asked Leopold&#x27;s brother, Prince Charles, to serve as regent.

After Leopold&#x27;s surrender, the British press denounced him as &quot;Traitor King&quot; and &quot;King Rat&quot;; the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; published a picture of Leopold with the headline &quot;The Face That Every Woman Now Despises&quot;. A group of Belgian refugees in Paris placed a message at King Albert&#x27;s statue denouncing his son as &quot;your unworthy successor&quot;. French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud accused Leopold of treason. Flemish historians Valaers and Van Goethem wrote that Leopold III had become &quot;The scapegoat of Reynaud&quot;, because Reynaud was likely already aware that the Battle of France was lost.

Leopold&#x27;s surrender was also decried by Winston Churchill. In the House of Commons on 4 June 1940 he said:

At the last moment when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his ministers and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his army and exposed our whole flank and means of retreat.
In 1949, Churchill&#x27;s comments about the events of May 1940 were published in &quot;Le Soir&quot; (12 February 1949). Leopold&#x27;s former secretary sent a letter to Churchill saying that Churchill was wrong. Churchill sent a copy of this letter to the King&#x27;s brother, Prince Charles, via his secretary André de Staercke. In his own letter Churchill wrote,

With regards to King Leopold, the words which I used at the time in the House of Commons are upon record and after careful consideration I do not see any reason to change them (...) it seemed to me and many others that the king should have been guided by the advice of his ministers and should not have favoured a course which identified the capitulation of the Belgian Army with the submission of the Belgian State to Herr Hitler and consequently taking them out of the war. Happily this evil was averted, and in the end, all came right. I need scarcely say that nothing I said at the time could be interpreted as a reflection upon the personal courage or honour of King Leopold.
De Staercke replied that Churchill was right: &quot;The Prince, Monsieur Spaak [Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak] and I read your text, which states the precise truth and seems perfect to us.&quot;

Belgian historian Francis Balace wrote that capitulation was inevitable because the Belgian Army was not able to fight any longer against the German army. Even Churchill admitted that their position was perilous. In a telegram to Field Marshal Lord Gort on 27 May, only one day before the Belgian capitulation, he wrote, &quot;We are asking them to sacrifice themselves for us.&quot;

===After the fall of France===
Upon Leopold&#x27;s surrender, the government ministers left for exile, mostly in France. When France fell at the end of June 1940, several ministers sought to return to Belgium. They made an overture to Leopold but were rebuffed.

Because of the great popularity of the king, and the unpopularity of the civil government from the middle of 1940, the government crisis persisted.

On 2 August 1940, several ministers conferred in Le Perthus in France near the Spanish border. Prime Minister Pierlot and Foreign Minister Spaak were persuaded to go to London, but they were able to start out for London only at the end of August and could travel only via neutral Spain and Portugal. When they reached Spain, they were arrested and detained by the regime of Francisco Franco; they finally arrived in London on 22 October.

===Meeting with Hitler===

Leopold rejected cooperation with the government of Nazi Germany and refused to administer Belgium in accordance with its dictates; thus, the Germans implemented a military government. Leopold attempted to assert his authority as monarch and head of the Belgian government, although he was a prisoner of the Germans. Despite his defiance of the Germans, the Belgian government-in-exile in London maintained that the king did not represent the Belgian government and was unable to reign. The Germans held him at first under house arrest at the Royal Castle of Laeken. Having since June 1940 desired a meeting with Adolf Hitler in respect of the situation of Belgian prisoners of war, Leopold III finally met with him on 19 November 1940. Leopold wanted to persuade Hitler to release Belgian POWs, and issue a public statement about Belgium&#x27;s future independence. Hitler refused to speak about the independence of Belgium or issue a statement about it. In refusing to publish a statement, Hitler preserved the king from being seen as cooperating with Germany, and thus engaged in treasonous acts, which would likely have obliged him to abdicate upon the liberation of Belgium. &quot;The [German] Chancellor saved the king two times.&quot;

===Second marriage===
On 11 September 1941, while a prisoner of the Germans, Leopold secretly married Lilian Baels in a religious ceremony that had no validity under Belgian law, which required a religious marriage to be preceded by a legal or civil marriage. On 6 December, they were married under civil law. The reason for the out-of-order marriages was never officially made public.

Jozef-Ernest Cardinal van Roey, Archbishop of Mechelen, wrote an open letter to parish priests throughout the country announcing Leopold&#x27;s second marriage on 7 December. The letter from the Cardinal revealed that the king&#x27;s new wife would be known as Princesse de Réthy, not Queen Lilian, and that any children they had would have no claim to the throne. Leopold&#x27;s new marriage damaged his reputation further in the eyes of many of his subjects.

===The &quot;Political Testament&quot;===
The ministers made several efforts during the war to work out a suitable agreement with Leopold III. They sent Pierlot&#x27;s son-in-law as an emissary to Leopold in January 1944, carrying a letter offering reconciliation from the Belgian government-in-exile. The letter never reached its destination, however, as the son-in-law was killed by the Germans en route. The ministers did not know what happened either to the message or the messenger and assumed that Leopold was ignoring them.

Leopold wrote his &quot;Political Testament&quot; in January 1944, shortly after this failed attempt at reconciliation. The testament was to be published in case he was not in Belgium when Allied forces arrived. The testament, which had an imperious and negative tone, considered the potential Allied movement into Belgium an &quot;occupation&quot;, not a &quot;liberation&quot;. It gave no credit to the active Belgian resistance. The Belgian government-in-exile in London did not like Leopold&#x27;s demand that the government ministers involved in the 1940 crisis be dismissed. The Allies did not like Leopold&#x27;s repudiation of the treaties concluded by the Belgian government-in-exile in London. The United States was particularly concerned about the economic treaty it had reached with the government-in-exile that enabled it to obtain Congolese uranium for America&#x27;s secret atom bomb program, which had been developed for use against Germany (although, as it turned out, Germany surrendered before the first bomb was ready).

The Belgian government did not publish the &quot;Political Testament&quot; and tried to ignore it, partly for fear of increased support for the Belgian Communist Party. When Pierlot and Spaak learned of its contents in September 1944, they were astonished and felt deceived by the king. According to André de Staercke, they were dismayed &quot;in the face of so much blindness and unawareness&quot;.

Churchill&#x27;s reaction to the Testament was simply, &quot;It stinks.&quot; In a sentence inspired by a quote of Talleyrand about the Bourbons after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815, Churchill declared, &quot;He is like the Bourbons, he has learned nothing and forgotten nothing.&quot;

==Exile and abdication==

===Deportation and exile===
On 7 June 1944, Heinrich Himmler ordered Leopold deported to Germany. Princess Lilian followed with the family in another car the following day under an SS armed guard. The Nazis interned the family in a fort at Hirschstein in Saxony from June 1944 to March 1945, and then at Strobl, Austria.

The British and American governments worried about the return of the king. Charles W. Sawyer, US Ambassador to Belgium, warned his government that an immediate return by the king to Belgium would &quot;precipitate serious difficulties&quot;. &quot;There are deep differences even in the royal family and the situation holds dynamite for Belgium and perhaps for Europe&quot;. &quot;The Foreign Office feared that an increasing minority in French-speaking Wallonia would demand either autonomy or annexation to France. Winant, the American Ambassador to the Court of Saint James&#x27;s, reported a Foreign Office official&#x27;s concern regarding irredentist propaganda in Wallonia.&quot; and that &quot;the French Ambassador in Brussels... is believed to have connived in the spreading of this propaganda&quot;.

Leopold and his companions were released by members of the United States 106th Cavalry Group in early May 1945. Because of the controversy about his conduct during the war, Leopold III and his wife and children were unable to return to Belgium and spent the next six years in exile at Pregny-Chambésy near Geneva, Switzerland. A regency under his brother Prince Charles had been established by the Belgian legislature in 1944.

===Resistance to Leopold&#x27;s return===

Frans Henri van den Dungen, rector of the Free University of Brussels, wrote to Leopold on 25 June 1945 about concerns for serious disorder in Wallonia, &quot;The question is not if the accusations against you are right or not [but that...] you are no longer a symbol of Belgian unity.&quot;

Robert Gillon, the President of the Belgian Senate, told the king that there was a threat of serious disorder: &quot;If there are only ten or twenty people killed, the situation would become terrible for the king.&quot;

The president of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, Frans Van Cauwelaert, was concerned that there would be a general strike in Wallonia and revolt in Liège. He wrote, &quot;The country is not able to put down the disorders because of the insufficient forces of the police and a lack of weapons.&quot;

In 1946, a commission of inquiry exonerated Leopold of treason. Nonetheless, controversy concerning his loyalty continued, and in 1950, a referendum was held about his future. Fifty-seven per cent of the voters favoured his return. The divide between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists ran along the lines of socialists and Walloons who were mostly opposed (42% favourable votes in Wallonia) and Christian Democrats and Flemish who were more in favour of the king (70% favourable votes in Flanders).

==General strike of 1950==

On his return to Belgium on 22 July 1950, Leopold was met with one of the most violent general strikes in the history of Belgium. Three protesters were killed when the gendarmerie opened fire with automatic weapons upon the protesters. The country stood on the brink of civil war, and Belgian banners were replaced by Walloon flags in Liège and other municipalities of Wallonia. To avoid tearing the country apart, and to preserve the monarchy, Leopold decided on 1 August 1950 to delegate his powers and duties to his 20-year-old son Baudouin, making the latter regent. He abdicated on 16 July 1951 in favour of Baudouin, being urged to do so by the government.

==Post-abdication life==
Leopold and his wife continued to advise King Baudouin until the latter&#x27;s marriage in 1960. Some Belgian historians, such as Vincent Delcorps, speak of there having been a &quot;diarchy&quot; during this period.

In retirement, he followed his passion as an amateur social anthropologist and entomologist and travelled the world, collecting zoological specimens. Two species of reptiles are named after him, &quot;Gehyra leopoldi&quot; and &quot;Polemon leopoldi&quot;.

Leopold died in 1983 in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert (&quot;Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe&quot;) following emergency heart surgery. He was interred next to Queen Astrid in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken. Leopold&#x27;s second wife, the Princess de Réthy, was later interred with them.

==Notable royal descendants==
As of 2023, two of Leopold&#x27;s grandsons are reigning monarchs: Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg since 2000, and King Philippe of Belgium since 2013.

<text>The United States Naval Academy (USNA, Navy, or Annapolis) is a federal service academy in Annapolis, Maryland. It was established on 10 October 1845 during the tenure of George Bancroft as Secretary of the Navy. The Naval Academy is the second oldest of the five U.S. service academies and it educates midshipmen for service in the officer corps of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. It is part of the Naval University System. The campus is located on the former grounds of Fort Severn at the confluence of the Severn River and Chesapeake Bay in Anne Arundel County, east of Washington, D.C., and southeast of Baltimore. The entire campus, known colloquially as the Yard, is a National Historic Landmark and home to many historic sites, buildings, and monuments. It replaced Philadelphia Naval Asylum in Philadelphia that had served as the first United States Naval Academy from 1838 to 1845 when the Naval Academy formed in Annapolis.

Candidates for admission generally must apply directly to the academy and apply separately for a nomination, usually from a member of Congress. Students are officers-in-training with the rank of midshipman. Tuition for midshipmen is fully funded by the Navy in exchange for an active duty service obligation upon graduation. Approximately 1,200 &quot;plebes&quot; (an abbreviation of the Ancient Roman word &quot;plebeian&quot;) enter the academy each summer for the rigorous Plebe Summer. About 1,000 midshipmen graduate and commission. Graduates are commissioned as either ensigns in the Navy or second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, but a small number can also be cross-commissioned as officers in other U.S. services, and the services of allied nations. The United States Naval Academy has some of the highest-paid graduates in the country according to starting salary. The academic program grants a Bachelor of Science degree with a curriculum that grades midshipmen&#x27;s performance upon a broad academic program, military leadership performance, and mandatory participation in competitive athletics. Midshipmen are required to adhere to the academy&#x27;s Honor Concept.

==Other Navy schools==
The Navy operates the Naval Postgraduate School and the Naval War College separately. The Naval Academy Preparatory School (NAPS) in Newport, Rhode Island, is the official preparatory school for the Naval Academy.

==History==
The first nautical school for officers was conceived by Commodore Arthur Sinclair in 1819 while in command of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Due to his zeal and perseverance, the &quot;Nautical School&quot; was opened on board the frigate on 3 December 1821 with between 40 and 50 midshipmen attached to the ship. The curriculum was diversified with naval tactics, astronomy, geography, French, history, English grammar, and international relations. The school operated until 1828, when USS &quot;Guerriere&quot; was ordered to duty in the Pacific. It was from that small start that the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis grew.

The history of the academy can be divided into four eras: the use of original Fort Severn from 1845 to 1861, &quot;Porter&#x27;s Academy&quot; between 1865 and 1903, &quot;Flagg Academy&quot; from 1903 to 1941, and the modern era since 1941.

The academy&#x27;s Latin motto is , which means &#x27;Through Knowledge, Sea Power&#x27;. It appears on a design devised by naval academy graduate (1867) Park Benjamin, Jr. It was adopted by the Navy Department in 1898 due to the efforts of another graduate (also 1867) and collaborator, Jacob W. Miller.

===Early years===
The institution was founded as the Naval School on 10 October 1845 by Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft. The campus was established at Annapolis on the grounds of the former U.S. Army post Fort Severn. The school opened with 50 midshipman students and seven professors. The decision to establish an academy on land may have been in part a result of the Affair, an alleged mutiny involving the Secretary of War&#x27;s son that resulted in his execution at sea. Commodore Matthew Perry had a considerable interest in naval education, supporting an apprentice system to train new seamen, and helped establish the curriculum for the United States Naval Academy. He was also a vocal proponent of modernization of the navy.

Originally a course of study for five years was prescribed. Only the first and last were spent at the school with the other three being passed at sea. The present name was adopted when the school was reorganized in 1850 and placed under the supervision of the chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography. Under the immediate charge of the superintendent, the course of study was extended to seven years with the first two and the last two to be spent at the school and the intervening three years at sea. The four years of study were made consecutive in 1851 and practice cruises were substituted for the three consecutive years at sea. The first class of naval academy students graduated on 10 June 1854. They were considered as passed midshipmen until 1912, when graduates were first sworn in as officers.

In 1850, Edward Seager joined the faculty as the first instructor of drawing, and he also served as the first fencing instructor. He held the position of teacher of the art of defence from 1851 to 1859.

In 1860, the Tripoli Monument was moved to the academy grounds. Later that year in August, the model of the USS &quot;Somers&quot; experiment was resurrected when , then 60 years old, was recommissioned as a school ship for the fourth-class midshipmen after a conversion and refitting begun in 1857. She was anchored at the yard, and the plebes lived on board the ship to immediately introduce them to shipboard life and experiences.

===American Civil War===
The American Civil War was disruptive to the Naval Academy. Southern sympathy ran high in Maryland. Although riots broke out, Maryland did not declare secession. The United States government was planning to move the school, when the sudden outbreak of hostilities forced a quick departure. Almost immediately the three upper classes were detached and ordered to sea, and the remaining elements of the academy were transported to Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island by the in April 1861, where the academy was set up in temporary facilities and opened in May. The Annapolis campus, meanwhile, was turned into a United States Army Hospital.
The United States Navy was stressed by the situation – 24% of its officers resigned to join the Confederate States Navy, including 95 graduates and 59 midshipmen, along with many key leaders who influenced USNA&#x27;s founding. As the first superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory, Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, who advocated for creating the United States Naval Academy, also resigned his commission.

The first superintendent, Admiral Franklin Buchanan, joined the Confederate States Navy as its first and primary admiral. Captain Sidney Smith Lee, the second commandant of midshipmen, and older brother of Robert E. Lee, left Federal service in 1861 for the Confederate States Navy. Lieutenant William Harwar Parker, CSN, class of 1848, and instructor at USNA, joined the Virginia State Navy, and then went on to become the superintendent of the Confederate States Naval Academy.

Lieutenant Charles &quot;Savez&quot; Read may have been &quot;anchor man&quot; (graduated last) in the class of 1860, but his later service to the Confederate States Navy included defending New Orleans, service on CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot; and CSS &quot;Florida&quot;, and command of a series of captured Union ships that culminated in seizing the US Revenue Cutter &quot;Caleb Cushing&quot; in Portland, Maine. Lieutenant James Iredell Waddell, CSN, a former instructor at the US Naval Academy, commanded the CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;.

The midshipmen and faculty returned to Annapolis in the summer of 1865, just after the war ended.

===Porter&#x27;s Academy: Civil War to Spanish–American War===

Civil War hero Admiral David Dixon Porter became superintendent in 1865. He found the infrastructure at Annapolis a shambles, the result of ill military use during the War. Porter attempted to restore the facilities. He concentrated on recruiting naval officers as opposed to civilians, a change of philosophy. He recruited teachers Stephen B. Luce, future admirals Winfield Scott Schley, George Dewey, and William T. Sampson. The midshipman battalion consisted of four companies. These were bunked in a single wooden building containing 100 rooms, one company to a floor. They held dress parades every evening except Sunday. Students were termed &quot;cadets&quot;, though sometimes &quot;cadet midshipmen&quot;; other appellations were used. Porter began organized athletics, usually intramural at the time.

Antoine Joseph Corbesier, an immigrant from Belgium, was appointed to the position of Assistant Swordmaster in 1864, and then Swordmaster at USNA in October 1865. He coached Navy fencers in intercollegiate competition from 1896, when the Naval Academy joined the Intercollegiate Fencing Association, until 1914, when he retired. By special act of Congress, he was commissioned a 1st lieutenant in the Marine Corps on 4 March 1914. He died on 26 March 1915 and is buried on Hospital Point.

In 1867, indoor plumbing and water was supplied to the family quarters. In 1868, the figurehead of Tamanend from (later nicknamed &quot;Tecumseh&quot;) was erected in the yard. Class rings were first issued in 1869. Weekly dances were held. Wags called the school &quot;Porter&#x27;s Dancing Academy&quot;. President U.S. Grant distributed diplomas to the class of 1869. Porter ensured continued room for expansion by overseeing the purchase of across College Creek, later known as Hospital Point.

In 1871, the color competition began, along with the selection of the color company and &quot;color girl&quot;.

In the 1870s, cuts in the military budget resulted in graduating much smaller classes. In 1872, 25 graduated. Eight of these made the Navy a career. The third class physically hazed the fourth class so ruthlessly that Congress passed an anti-hazing law in 1874. Hazing continued in more stealthy forms.

Many firsts for minorities occurred during this period. In 1877, Kiro Kunitomo, a Japanese citizen, graduated from the academy. And then in 1879, Robert F. Lopez was the first Hispanic-American to graduate from the academy.

John H. Conyers of South Carolina was the first African-American admitted on 21 September 1872. After his arrival, he was subject to severe, ongoing hazing, including verbal torment, and beatings. His classmates even attempted to drown him. Three cadets were dismissed as a result, but the abuse, including shunning, continued in more subtle forms and Conyers finally resigned in October 1873.

In 1874, the curriculum was altered to study naval topics in the final two years at the academy. In 1878, the academy was awarded a gold medal for academics at the Universal Exposition in Paris. In the late 19th century, Congress required the academy to teach a formal course in hygiene, the only course required by Congress of any military academy.

In 1890, Navy adopted the goat mascot after winning its first football game with Army.

===The Flagg Academy: Spanish–American War to WWI===

The Spanish–American War of 1898 greatly increased the academy&#x27;s importance and the campus was almost wholly rebuilt and much enlarged between 1899 and 1906. The ground on which most of the academy sat was dredged from the surrounding bodies of water and consisted of silt. This was too fragile for the newer heavy stone buildings. Pilings were sunk from to deep. Some wooden with iron caps; modern ones of steel. Today&#x27;s campus dates from that era. In 1905, Isherwood Hall, containing the Department of Marine Engineering, was constructed.

Prior to that era, about 43 men entered annually. There were 114 joining the class of 1905, 201 with the class of 1908.

The academy built a modern hospital in 1907, the fourth in sequence, on what is today called &quot;Hospital Point&quot;.

In 1910, the academy established its own dairy farm. In 1913, the Navy purchased the Howard&#x27;s Adventure estate in nearby Gambrills, Maryland to expand their dairy operations. The farm is also home to Bill the Goat. The Naval Academy dairy was closed in 1998.

====The Aviation School====
On 23 August 1911, the Navy officers on flight duty at Hammondsport, New York, and Dayton, Ohio, were ordered to report for duty at the Engineering Experiment Station, Naval Academy, &quot;in connection with the test of gasoline motors and other experimental work in the development of aviation, including instruction at the aviation school&quot; being set up on Greenbury Point, Annapolis. The &quot;aerodrome&quot; at Greenbury Point sat on 1000 square feet of land and consisted of a building with a rubber-reinforced roof containing three hangars (one for each of the newly purchased airplanes), a workshop, an office, and several bunk rooms. All three airplanes cost a total of $14,000. Over 100 officers applied for aviation duty prior to August 1911. Swimming was among a set of other qualifications that a pilot candidate must have passed before being accepted to aviation duty. Pilot qualifications were in accordance with Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) standards. In the presence of a committee of the Aero Club of America, a pilot candidate had to fly five figure eights around two flags buoyed 1500 feet apart then land within 150 feet of an established mark. This course had to be completed twice. The test also required the prospective aviator to climb to a minimum altitude of 150 ft (officially 50 meters). It was estimated by CAPT Washington Irving Chambers that a student could qualify as a new pilot in about a month, weather permitting. All students wore life preservers. The control wheel of the Curtiss machines featured a &quot;shift control&quot; where the controls could be &quot;thrown&quot; between the student and instructor at any time. The Wright machine was delivered to Greenbury by August 1911, but was not yet configured with water gear. Navy flight training moved to NAS Pensacola, Florida, in January 1914.

In 1912, , sunk at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, was raised and used as the &quot;brig&quot; ship for the academy.

By 1912, the midshipmen were organized into a brigade, its current structure. The prior organization was named a regiment.

In 1914, the Midshipmen Drum and Bugle corps was formed and by 1922 it went defunct. They were revived in 1926.

The brigade and faculty tripled during WWI. The 3rd and 4th wings of Bancroft Hall were built.

In 1918, the great flu pandemic of 1918 infected about half the brigade (1,000 out of 2,000 men); ten midshipmen died.

====World War I and interwar period====
With the advent of the automobile and improved roads, the academy became a tourist attraction.

At the 1920 summer Olympics men&#x27;s 8+ rowing competition in Brussels, the Naval Academy rowing men&#x27;s 8+ (The Wonder Crew) won the gold medal. US collegiate boats won the gold medal in the 8+ competition at the next seven Olympics – a standing record as of 2019 for consecutive gold medal wins by any nation in a particular sport.

The Naval Academy football team played the University of Washington in the Rose Bowl tying 14–14. In 1925, the second-class ring dance was started. In 1925, the Midshipmen Drum and Bugle Corps was formally reestablished. In 1926, &quot;Navy Blue and Gold&quot;, composed by organist and choirmaster J. W. Crosley, was first sung in public. It became a tradition to sing this alma mater song at the end of student and alumni gatherings such as pep rallies and football games, and on graduation day. In 1926, Navy won the national collegiate football championship title. In the fall of 1929, the Secretary of the Navy gave his approval for graduates to compete for Rhodes Scholarships. Six graduates were selected for that honor that same year. The Association of American Universities accredited the Naval Academy curriculum on 30 October 1930.

In 1930, the class of 1891 presented a bronze replica of the figurehead of Tamanend to replace the deteriorating wooden figurehead that had been prominently displayed on campus.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law an act of Congress (Public Law 73–21, 48 Stat. 73) on 25 May 1933 providing for the Bachelor of Science degree for Naval, Military, and Coast Guard Academies. Four years later, Congress authorized the superintendent to award a Bachelor of Science degree to all living graduates. Reserve officer training was re-established in anticipation of World War II in 1941.
In 1939, the first Yard patrol boat arrived.

In 1940, the academy stopped using &quot;Reina Mercedes&quot; as a brig for disciplining midshipmen, and restricted them to Bancroft Hall, instead.

In April 1941, superintendent Rear Admiral Russell Willson refused to allow the school&#x27;s lacrosse team to play a visiting team from Harvard University because the Harvard team included an African-American player. Harvard&#x27;s athletic director ordered the player home and the game was played on 4 April, as scheduled, which Navy won 12–0. Georgia Tech President and Colonel Dr. Blake R Van Leer would later be appointed by President Harry S. Truman to the Visitor Board and assist with its curriculum. Dr. Van Leer was already a member to The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization who had a focus to work against racism through influential statements on race starting with a declaration of anthropologists.

In 1941, the 5th and 6th wings of Bancroft Hall were completed. Landfill was made outboard of the hospital to create a sports field. Fill was made on the north side of the Severn to create an area for seaplanes.

===Modern era: World War II to present===
The academy and its support facilities became part of the Severn River Naval Command from 1941 to 1962.

A total of 3,319 graduates were commissioned during World War II. Dr. Chris Lambertsen held the first closed-circuit oxygen SCUBA course in the United States for the Office of Strategic Services maritime unit at the academy on 17 May 1943. In 1945, A Department of Aviation was established. That year a vice admiral, Aubrey W. Fitch, became superintendent. The naval academy celebrated its centennial. During the century of its existence, roughly 18,563 midshipmen had graduated, including the class of 1946.

The academy was accredited in 1947 by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

On January 15, 1947, James L. Holloway became the 35th superintendent of the United States Naval Academy, succeeding Vice Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch. At 48, Holloway was the youngest superintendent in fifty years, having been handpicked by Secretary of the Navy Forrestal to implement the academic changes suggested by the Holloway Board, which had recommended that the Naval Academy curriculum move away from rote recitation and continuous crams &quot;to give a stronger emphasis to basic and general education, rendering more fundamental and less detailed instruction in strictly naval material and techniques.&quot;

An accelerated course was given to midshipmen during the war years which affected classes entering during the war and graduating later. The students studied year around. This affected the class of 1948 most of all. For the only time, a class was divided by academic standing. 1948A graduated in June 1947; the remainder, called 1948B, a year later.

From 1946 to 1961, N3N amphibious biplanes were used at the academy to introduce midshipmen to flying.

On 3 June 1949, Wesley A. Brown, the sixth African-American to enter the academy, became the first to graduate, followed several years later by Lawrence Chambers, who became the first African-American graduate to make flag rank.

The 1950 Navy fencing team won the NCAA national championship.

The Navy eight-man rowing crew won the gold medal at 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. They were also named National Intercollegiate Champions. In 1955, the tradition of greasing Herndon Monument for plebes to climb to exchange their plebe &quot;dixie cup&quot; covers (hats) for a midshipman&#x27;s cover started.

In 1957, the moored training ship &quot;Reina Mercedes&quot;, ruined by a hurricane, was scrapped.

The 1959 fencing team won the NCAA national championship, and became the first to do so by placing first in all three weapons (foil, épée, and saber). All 3 fencers were selected for the 1960 Olympics team, as was head coach Andre Deladrier. The Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, funded by donations, was dedicated 26 September 1959.

From 1959 to 1973, land was reclaimed from the Chesapeake Bay and Severn River, removal of Isherwood, Melville, and Griffin Halls, and by moving the stadium off-campus. This allowed room for expansion of Bancroft Hall, and the addition of Mitscher, Michelson, Chauvenet, Alumni, Rickover, and Hopper Halls, and the Nimitz Library. Encroached parade grounds and athletic fields were moved riverside onto the newly filled areas.

Joe Bellino (Class of 1961) was awarded the Heisman Trophy on 22 June 1960. In 1961, the Naval Academy Foreign Affairs Conference was started. The U.S. Department of the Interior designated the campus of the U.S. Naval Academy as a National Historic Landmark on 21 August 1961.

The 1962 fencing team won the NCAA national championship.

In 1963, Roger Staubach, Class of 1965, was awarded the Heisman Trophy.

In 1963, the academy changed from a marking system based on 4.0 to a letter grade. Midshipmen began referring to the statue of Tamanend as the &quot;god of 2.0&quot; instead of &quot;the god of 2.5&quot;, the former failing mark.

The academy started the Trident Scholar Program in 1963. From 3 to 16 juniors are selected for independent study during their final year.

Professor Samuel Massie became the first African-American faculty member in 1966. On 4 June 1969, the first designated engineering degrees were granted to qualified graduates of the Class of 1969. During the period 1968 to 1972, the academy moved beyond engineering to include more than 20 majors. From 1845 to 1968, midshipmen studied identical courses, with the exception of a choice of foreign language. In 1970, the &quot;James Forrestal Lecture&quot; was created, named for the first U.S. Secretary of Defense in 1947/1949. This has resulted in various leaders speaking to midshipmen, including U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, football coach Dick Vermeil, and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and others.

In 1972, Lieutenant Commander Georgia Clark became the first female officer instructor, and Dr. Rae Jean Goodman was appointed to the faculty as the first civilian woman. Later in 1972, a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia terminated compulsory chapel attendance, a tradition which had been in effect since 1853. In September 1973, the new expansive library facility complex was completed and named for Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Class of 1905.
On 8 August 1975, Congress authorized women to attend service academies. The Class of 1980 was inducted with 81 female midshipmen. In 1980, the academy included &quot;Hispanic/Latino&quot; as a racial category for demographic purposes; four women identified themselves as Hispanic in the class of 1981, and these women become the first Hispanic women to graduate from the academy: Carmel Gilliland (who had the highest class rank), Lilia Ramirez (who retired with the rank of commander), Ina Marie Gomez, and Trinora Pinto. In 1979, the traditional &quot;June Week&quot; was renamed &quot;Commissioning Week&quot; because graduation had been moved earlier to May.

In 1980, Elizabeth Anne Belzer (later Rowe) became the first woman graduate, and Janie L. Mines became the first African-American woman graduate. On 23 May 1984, Kristine Holderied became the first woman to graduate at the head of the class. In addition, the Class of 1984 included the first naturalized Korean-American graduates, all choosing commissions in the U.S. Navy. The four Korean-American ensigns were Walter Lee, Thomas Kymn, Andrew Kim, and Se-Hun Oh.

In 1982, Isherwood, Griffin, and Melville Halls were demolished.

On 30 July 1987, the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (CSAB) granted accreditation for the Computer Science program. In 1991, Midshipman Juliane Gallina, class of 1992, became the first woman brigade commander. On 29 January 1994, the first genderless service assignment was held. All billets were opened equally to men and women with the exception of special warfare and submarine duty.
On 12 March 1995, Lieutenant Commander Wendy B. Lawrence, Class of 1981, became a mission specialist in the space shuttle Endeavour. She is the first woman USNA graduate to fly in space.

To celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis (1845–1995), the U.S. Postal Service printed a commemorative postage stamp; the First Day of Issue was 10 October 1995.

Freedom 7, America&#x27;s first space capsule shot into sub-orbit in 1961, was placed on display at the visitor center as the centerpiece of the &quot;Grads in Space&quot; exhibit on 23 September 1998. The late Rear Admiral Alan Shepard, Class of 1945, had flown Mercury program capsule &quot;Freedom 7&quot; into space on 5 May 1961. His historic flight marked America&#x27;s first step in the space race.

On 11 September 2001, the academy lost 14 alumni in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and The Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. The academy and its bounds was placed under unprecedented high security.

In August 2007, Superintendent Vice Admiral Jeffrey Fowler changed academy policy to limit liberty, required more squad interaction to emphasize that &quot;we are a nation at war.&quot;

On 3 November 2007, the Navy football team defeated long-time rival Notre Dame for the first time in 43 years: 46–44 in triple overtime. The two teams have met every year since 1926 and continue a rivalry that became amicable when Notre Dame volunteered to open its facilities for training of naval officers in World War II. Notre Dame&#x27;s enrollment fell to just 250 students during World War II however the Navy was credited with saving the university by using its campus to train 12,000 men to become officers.

In November 2007, Memorial Hall was the venue for a 50-nation Annapolis Conference on a Palestinian-Israeli peace process discussion.

In 2017, hospital functions were moved across the Severn.

In 2019 the USNA team represented the U.S. in the King&#x27;s Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The race commemorated the centenary of the 1919 Royal Henley Peace Regatta, and included the original World War I allies Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, joined in 2019 by Germany and the Netherlands. After exciting eliminations, the USNA mixed crew won the final race beating the strong German team.

In 2024, the USNA rescinded the invitation it had given Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a scholar of authoritarianism and fascist movements, to deliver the annual Bancroft Lecture in response to pressure from right-wing politicians. Ben-Ghiat&#x27;s planned lecture was strictly nonpartisan and historical in nature.

==Training ships==
==Rank structure==

The student body is known as the Brigade of Midshipmen. Students attending the U.S. Naval Academy are appointed to the rank of midshipman and serve on active duty in that rank. &quot;Naval Academy midshipmen are classified as officers of the line but are officers only in a qualified sense. They rank just below chief warrant officers.&quot;

Legally, midshipmen are a special grade of officer that ranks above the most senior enlisted grades (E-9) and below the lowest grade of chief warrant officer (W-2) in the Navy and Coast Guard (the Navy and Coast Guard discontinued the rank of warrant officer, WO-1, in 1975). Additionally, midshipmen rank below warrant officer (W-1) in the Marine Corps and the Army, and below second lieutenant (O-1) in the Air Force (the Air Force ceased appointing warrant officers in 1959 and the last USAF WO died in 2008).

Midshipmen are classified not as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, but as fourth class, third class, second class, and first class, respectively.

A member of the entering class—the fourth class, the lowest rank of midshipmen—is also known as a &quot;plebe&quot; (plural &quot;plebes&quot;). Because the first year at the academy is one of transformation from a civilian into a military officer, plebes must conform to a number of rules and regulations not placed on their seniors—the upper three classes of midshipmen—and have additional tasks and responsibilities that disappear upon promotion to midshipman third class.

Third class midshipmen have been assimilated into the brigade and are treated with more respect because they are upperclassmen. They are commonly called &quot;youngsters&quot;. Because of their new stature and rank, the youngsters are allowed such privileges as watching television, listening to music, and wearing non-issued Navy and Marine Corps related clothing.

Second class midshipmen are charged with training plebes. They report directly to the first class, and issue orders as necessary to carry out their responsibilities. Second class midshipmen are allowed to drive their own cars (but may not park them on campus) and are allowed to enter or exit the Yard (campus) in civilian attire (weekends only).

First class midshipmen (nicknamed &quot;firsties&quot;) have more freedoms and liberty in the brigade. While they must participate in mandatory sports and military activities and maintain academic standards, they are also charged with the leadership of the brigade. Firsties are allowed to park their cars on campus and have greater leave and liberty privileges than any other class.

The brigade is divided into two regiments of three battalions each. Six companies make up each battalion, for a total of 36 companies. The midshipman command structure is headed by a first class midshipman known as the brigade commander, chosen for outstanding leadership performance. The brigade commander is responsible for much of the brigade&#x27;s day-to-day activities as well as the professional training of midshipmen. Overseeing all brigade activities is the commandant of midshipmen, an active-duty Navy captain or Marine Corps colonel. Working for the commandant, experienced Navy and Marine Corps officers are assigned as company and battalion officers.

===Insignia===


==Uniforms==
Midshipmen at the academy wear service dress uniforms similar to those of U.S. Navy officers, with shoulder-board and/or sleeve insignia varying by school year or midshipman officer rank. All wear gold anchor insignia on both lapel collars of the service dress blue jacket. Shoulder boards, worn on summer white, service/full dress white, dinner dress uniforms, and the shirt of the service/full dress blue uniform have a gold anchor and a number of stripes indicating year or rank. Midshipman officer (also first class) shoulder boards have a small gold star in place of the anchor and have 1 through 6 horizontal stripes indicating their rank.

On the working blue uniform shirt collar, a freshman (Midshipman Fourth Class or &quot;plebe&quot;) wears no collar insignia, a (Midshipman Third Class or &quot;youngster&quot;) wears a single fouled anchor on the right collar point, a Junior (Midshipman Second Class) fouled anchors on each collar point, and a Senior (Midshipman First Class or &quot;firstie&quot;) wears fouled anchors with perched eagles. First class midshipmen in officer billets replace those devices with their respective midshipman officer collar insignia. Midshipman officer collar insignia are a series of gold bars, from the rank of Midshipman Ensign (one bar or stripe) to Midshipman Captain (six bars or stripes).

Depending on the season, midshipmen wear Summer White or Service Dress Blue as their service dress uniform, and Working Blue as their daily class uniform. In 2008, the first class midshipmen wore the Service Khaki as the daily uniform, but this option was repealed following the graduation of the class of 2011. First class midshipmen may wear their service assignment uniform on second semester &quot;Tactical Thursdays&quot; (i.e., naval aviator and naval flight officer selectees wear flight suits; submarine and surface warfare selectees wear coveralls or Navy Working Uniforms with their new command ballcaps; Marine Corps selectees wear MARPAT camouflage utilities). A unique uniform consisting of a Navy blue double-breasted jacket with brass buttons and high collar, blue or white high-rise trousers (white worn during Graduation Week), and duty belt with silver NA buckle, is worn for formal parades during spring and autumn parade seasons.

During commissioning week (formerly known as &quot;June week&quot;), the uniform is Summer White.

==Campus==


The campus (or &quot;Yard&quot;) has grown from a Army post named Fort Severn in 1845 to a campus in the 21st century. By comparison, the United States Air Force Academy is and United States Military Academy (Army) is .

===Halls and principal buildings===
* Bancroft Hall is the largest building at the Naval Academy and the largest college dormitory in the world. It houses all midshipmen. Open to the public are Memorial Hall, a midshipman-maintained memorial to graduates who have died during military operations, and the Rotunda, the ceremonial entrance to Bancroft Hall. The Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy resides in the Rotunda while Navy is in possession of it. It was named for the academy&#x27;s founder, Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft, and designed by Ernest Flagg.
* The Naval Academy Chapel, at the center of the campus, across from Herndon Monument, has a high dome that is visible throughout Annapolis. Designed by Ernest Flagg. The chapel was featured on the U.S. Postal Service postage stamp honoring the academy&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 1995. John Paul Jones lies in the crypt beneath the chapel.
* Commodore Uriah P. Levy Center and Jewish Chapel, primarily funded with private donations, was dedicated on 23 September 2005. The chapel was named for Commodore Uriah P. Levy and houses a Jewish chapel, the honor board, ethics, character learning center, officer development spaces, a social director, and academic boards. Built featuring Jerusalem stone, the architecture of the exterior is consistent with nearby Bancroft Hall.
* Alumni Hall is the primary assembly hall for the Brigade of Midshipmen and has two dining facilities. It hosts various sporting events (including the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s intercollegiate basketball games) and is used by alumni for reunions. The Bob Hope Performing Arts Center is located there.
* Halsey Field House contains an indoor track, squash and tennis courts, five basketball courts, a 65 tatami dojo for Aikido/Judo, a climbing wall, and assorted athletic and workout facilities and offices. Before construction of Alumni Hall, it was used by Navy basketball teams and was the site of midshipman assemblies. It was named for William F. Halsey, Jr.
* Hubbard Hall, used by the crew team, is a three-story building on Dorsey Creek, from the Severn River. Also known as the Boat House, it was renovated in 1993 and now includes the Fisher Rowing Center. It was named for Rear Admiral John Hubbard (Class of 1870).
* Lejeune Hall, built in 1982, contains an Olympic-class swimming pool and diving tower, a mat room for wrestling and hand-to-hand martial arts, and the Athletic Hall of Fame. Named for John A. Lejeune, it is the first USNA building to be named for a Marine Corps officer.
* Wesley Brown Field House houses physical education, varsity sports, intramural athletics, club sports, and personal-fitness programs and equipment. The cross country and track and field teams, the sprint football team, the women&#x27;s lacrosse team, and sixteen club sports all use this building. It has a full-length, retractable football field. When the field is retracted, you can then use the 200-meter track (with hydraulically controlled banked curves) and three permanent basketball courts. It also has eight locker rooms and a medical facility. It was named for Wesley A. Brown, Class of 1949, who was the academy&#x27;s first African American graduate.

===Monuments and memorials===

* Gokoku-ji Bell. A copy of the original bell which was brought back to the United States in 1855 by Commodore Matthew Perry following his mission to Japan. The bell is placed in front of Bancroft Hall and rung in a semi-annual ceremony for each victory that Navy has registered over Army, to include one of the nation&#x27;s oldest football rivalries, the Army–Navy Game. The current bell is an exact replica of the original, which the United States Navy returned to the people of Okinawa in 1987.
* Enterprise Bell. Originally serving on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CV-6), the ship&#x27;s bell was brought to the academy in 1950. It is sounded after most games when Navy wins over Army in any one of the three sports seasons.
* USS Delaware figurehead. This is a bronze replica of the original figurehead of ship-of-the-line . It was presented to the academy by the Class of 1891. This replica, one of the most famous monuments on campus, was commonly known as Tecumseh. However, when it adorned the American man-of-war, it commemorated Tamanend, the revered Delaware chief who welcomed William Penn to America, not Tecumseh. In times past, the bronze replica was considered a good-luck &quot;mascot&quot; for the midshipmen, who threw pennies at the quiver and offered left-handed salutes whenever they needed good luck, such as a sports win over West Point and spiritual help for examinations. It is also referred to as the God of 2.0 because 2.0 is the minimum passing GPA at USNA, and the mids offer pennies to help achieve this. It was used as a morale booster during football weeks and on special occasions when the face was painted using themes like super heroes, action heroes, humorous figures, a leprechaun (before Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day), and a naval officer during Commissioning Week.
* Battle ensigns. Famous flags of the U.S. Navy and captured flags from enemy ships are displayed throughout the academy. The most famous, perhaps, is the &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship&quot; flag flown by Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry at the Battle of Lake Erie on 10 September 1813; it bears the dying words of Captain James Lawrence, captain of the . It was displayed in Memorial Hall, which is in the portion of Bancroft Hall open to the general public until 2004. It underwent conservation and is now on display in the Museum in Preble Hall. The only British royal standard taken by capture was displayed in Mahan Hall. It was taken at Toronto (then York) in the War of 1812.
* Herndon Monument. The Monument was commissioned by the officers of the U.S. Navy as a tribute to Commander William Lewis Herndon (1813–1857) after his loss in the Pacific Mail Steamer &quot;Central America&quot; during a hurricane off the North Carolina coast on 12 September 1857. Herndon had followed a longtime custom of the sea that a ship&#x27;s captain is the last person to depart his ship in peril. It was erected in its current location on 16 June 1860 and has never been moved, even though the academy was completely rebuilt between 1899 and 1908.
* Memorial Hall. A memorial to graduates in Bancroft Hall who died during military operations. It includes an honor roll, scrolls, and plaques. In the aftermath of the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident, the Navy balked at listing 2 &quot;Liberty&quot; crew members on their memorial wall. The crew members in question were Lieutenant Commander Philip Armstrong Jr. and Lieutenant Stephen Toth. It took Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer&#x27;s personal intervention to reverse their decision. Moorer angrily commented on the Academy&#x27;s attempt to omit the names: &quot;I intervened and was able to reverse the apparent idea that dying in a cowardly, one-sided attack by a supposed ally is somehow not the same as being killed by an avowed enemy.&quot;
* Pearl Harbor Memorial. At Alumni Hall, a wall is reserved by the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association to commemorate those who were killed during the attack on Pearl Harbor.
* Tripoli Monument. This is the oldest military monument in the U.S. and honors the US servicemen of the First Barbary War: Master Commandant Richard Somers, Lieutenant James Caldwell, James Decatur (brother of Stephen Decatur), John Dorsey, Joseph Israel, and Henry Wadsworth. Originally known as the Naval Monument, it was carved of Carrara marble in Italy in 1806 and brought to the U.S. as ballast on board the (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;). From its original location in the Washington Navy Yard, it was moved to the west terrace of the national Capitol and finally, in 1860, to the Naval Academy.
* USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; memorial. In Alumni Hall, a concourse is dedicated to Lieutenant Lloyd Garnett and his shipmates aboard , who earned their ship the reputation as the &quot;destroyer escort that fought like a battleship&quot; in the Battle of Leyte Gulf during World War II.

* The Mexican War Midshipmen&#x27;s Monument. Located at the intersection of Stribling Walk (16,000 bricks) and Chapel Walk, it is in memory of one midshipman (Shubrick) who lost his life in the siege of Veracruz in 1847, and three midshipmen (Clemson, Hynson, Pillsbury) who lost their lives when the brig sank in 1846.
* The Macedonian Monument. At the end of Stribling Walk opposite Mahan Hall is the figurehead of . &quot;Macedonian&quot; was defeated in battle by the frigate 25 October 1812.
* The Saitö Monument. At the west entrance of Luce Hall is a Japanese granite pagoda erected in memory of Hiroshi Saitö, Japanese Ambassador to the United States from 1934 to 1939. Ambassador Saitö was admired in Washington for his efforts to maintain US-Japan diplomatic relations as tension built between the two nations over the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. The monument was presented by the Saitö family in gratitude for, &quot;the courtesy extended by [the] institution at the time of the [Saitö&#x27;s] departure,&quot; on the cruiser &quot;Astoria.&quot; The monument was erected in June 1941, less than 6 months before the opening of hostilities between the two countries.

===Brigade sports complex===
The complex includes McMullen Hockey Arena where the men&#x27;s ice-hockey team is located; rugby venues, an indoor hitting, chipping and putting facility for the golf team, and the Tose Family Tennis Center – including the Fluegel-Moore Tennis Stadium.

===Cemetery and columbarium===
===Glenn Warner Soccer Facility===
===Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium===
===Terwilliger Brothers Field===
The academy baseball team plays at the Terwilliger Brothers Field at Max Bishop Stadium.

==Supervision of the Academy==
In 1850, the academy was placed under the jurisdiction of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography but was transferred to the Bureau of Navigation when that organization was established in 1862. The academy was placed under the direct care of the Navy Department in 1867, but for many years the Bureau of Navigation provided administrative routine and financial management.

, the Superintendent of the Naval Academy reports directly to the Chief of Naval Operations. The Board of Visitors annually audits the academy. Its recommendations constitute a mandate to the administration. It is composed of officials appointed by Congress and the president. The 2020 recommendations include changing the historic names of buildings named after people who deserted the Union for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

==Faculty==
Roughly 500 faculty members are evenly divided between civilian professors and military instructors. The civilian professors nearly all have a PhD and can be awarded tenure, usually upon promotion from assistant professor to associate professor. Fewer of the military instructors have a PhD but nearly all have a master&#x27;s degree. Most of them are assigned to the academy for only two or three years. Additionally, there are adjunct professors, hired to fill temporary shortages in various disciplines. The adjunct professors are not eligible for tenure.

===Permanent military professors (PMP)===
A small number of officers at the academy are designated as permanent military professors (PMP), initially at the academic rank of assistant professor. All PMPs have PhDs, and remain at the academy until statutory retirement. Most are commanders in the Navy; a few are captains. Like civilian professors, they seek academic promotion to the rank of associate professor and professor. However, they are not eligible for tenure.

===Class of 1957 Distinguished Chair of Naval Heritage===
The &quot;Class of 1957 Distinguished Chair of Naval Heritage&quot; is an academic professorial chair in the history department. In order to preserve and promote a better understanding of professional naval heritage in midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy, the academy&#x27;s Class of 1957 donated the funds to permanently endow this position. It is designed to be a visiting position for a distinguished senior academic historian, who is to hold the post for one or two years. The position was first occupied in 2006 and, in addition to teaching requirements, the occupant is expected to give the McMullen Seapower Lecture at the academy&#x27;s biennial McMullen Naval History Symposium.

====Chair holders====
* Williamson Murray, January 2006 – June 2007
* Andrew Gordon, August 2007 – June 2009
* Ronald H. Spector, August 2009 – June 2010

===McCain-Fulbright Distinguished Visiting Professor Program===
The program was created by Congress to bring mid-career international academics to USNA to teach classes on subjects pertaining to their regional background. Scholars will also practice outreach to D.C. area think tanks and military higher education institutions around the country.

====Chair holders====
* Sebastian Bruns, August 2021 - May 2022
* Sinderpahl Singh, August 2022 - December 2022.

==Appointment process==
By an Act of Congress passed in 1903, two midshipman appointments were allowed for each senator, representative, and delegate in Congress, two for the District of Columbia, and five each year at large. Currently each member of Congress and the vice president can have five appointees attending the Naval Academy at any time. When any appointee graduates or otherwise leaves the academy, a vacancy is created. Candidates are nominated by their senator, representative, or delegate in Congress, and those appointed at large are nominated by the vice president. The applicants do not have to know their Congressman to be nominated. Congressmen generally nominate ten people per vacancy. They can nominate people in a competitive manner, or they can have a principal nomination. In a competitive nomination, all ten applicants are reviewed by the academy, to see who is the most qualified. If the congressman appoints a principal nominee, then as long as that candidate is physically, medically, and academically found qualified by the academy, he or she will be admitted, even if there are more qualified applicants. The degree of difficulty in obtaining a nomination varies greatly according to the number of applicants in a particular state. The process of obtaining a nomination typically consists of completing an application, completing one or more essays, and obtaining one or more letters of recommendation and often requires an interview either in person or over the phone. These requirements are set by the respective senator or representative and are in addition to the USNA application.

The Secretary of the Navy may appoint 170 enlisted members of the Regular and Reserve Navy and Marine Corps to the Naval Academy each year. Additional sources of appointment are open to children of career military personnel (100 per year) and 65 appointments are available to children of military members who were killed in action, or were rendered 100% disabled due to injuries received in action, or are currently prisoners of war or missing in action. Typically five to ten candidates are nominated for each appointment, which are normally awarded competitively; candidates who do not receive the appointment they are competing for may still be admitted to the academy as a qualified alternate. If a candidate is considered qualified but not picked up, they may receive an indirect admission to either a Naval Academy Foundation prep school or the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Newport; the following year, these candidates enlist in the Navy Reserve (or, in the case of prior enlisted members, remain in the Navy) and are eligible for Secretary of the Navy nominations, which are granted as a matter of course. To receive an appointment to the Naval Academy, students at the Naval Academy Preparatory School must first pass with a 2.2 QPA (a combination of GPA and Fitness Assessments), although this is waiverable. A candidate must also receive a recommendation for appointment from the commanding officer. The appointment process has been criticized as giving preferential treatment towards athletes.

Children of Medal of Honor recipients are automatically appointed to the Naval Academy; they only need to meet admission requirements.

===Admissions requirements===
To be admitted, candidates must be between seventeen and twenty-three years of age upon entrance, unmarried with no children, and of good moral character. The current process includes a college application, personality testing, standardized testing, and personal references. Candidates for admission must also undergo a physical aptitude test (the CFA or Candidate Fitness Assessment [formerly the Physical Readiness Examination]) as well as a complete physical exam including a separate visual acuity test to be eligible for appointment. A medical waiver will automatically be sought on behalf of candidates with less than 20/20 vision, as well as a range of other injuries or illnesses. The physical aptitude test is most often administered by a high school physical education teacher or sports team coach.

A small number of international students, usually from smaller allied or friendly countries, are admitted into each class. (International students from larger allies, such as France and the United Kingdom, typically come as shorter-term exchange students from their national naval colleges or academies.) The Class of 2025 includes 16 international students from: Egypt (1), Fiji (1), Ghana (1), Indonesia (2), Jordan (1), Malaysia (1), Maldives (1), Peru (1), Philippines (2), Sri Lanka (1), Taiwan (1), Thailand (1), and Tunisia (2).

Seven second class cadets each from West Point, the Air Force Academy, and the Coast Guard Academy, spend a fall semester at Annapolis. The same applies for midshipmen exchanged out to those academies at the same time. The exchange process is competitive.

==Academics==

The Naval Academy received accreditation as an approved &quot;technological institution&quot; in 1930. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law an act of Congress providing for the Bachelor of Science degree for the Naval, Military, and Coast Guard Academies. The Class of 1933 was the first to receive this degree and have it written in the diploma. In 1937, an act of Congress extended to the superintendent of the Naval Academy the authority to award the Bachelor of Science degree to all living graduates. The academy later replaced a fixed curriculum taken by all midshipmen with the present core curriculum plus 22 major fields of study.

Academic departments at the Naval Academy are organized into three divisions: Engineering and Weapons, known as Division I, Mathematics and Science, known as Division II, and Humanities and Social Sciences, known as Division III.

In its 2021 edition, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the U.S. Naval Academy as the No. 1 top public school, No. 6 in national liberal arts colleges in the U.S., and No. 5 for Best Undergraduate Engineering program at schools where doctorates not offered. In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the U.S. Naval Academy as No. 24 overall in its report &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot;.

===Moral education===
Moral and ethical development is fundamental to all aspects of the Naval Academy. From Plebe Summer through graduation, the Officer Development Program, a four-year integrated program, focuses on integrity, honor, and mutual respect based on the moral values of respect for human dignity, respect for honesty and respect for the property of others.

One of the goals of the program is to develop midshipmen to possess a sense of their own moral beliefs and the ability to express them. Honor is emphasized through the Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen, which states:

Similar ideals are expressed in the honor codes of the other service academies. However, midshipmen are allowed to confront someone they see violating the code without formally reporting it. It is believed that this method is a better way of developing the honor of midshipmen as opposed to the non-toleration clauses of the other service academies and is a better way of building honor and trust.

Brigade Honor Committees composed of upper-class midshipmen are responsible for the education and training of the Honor Concept. Depending on the severity of the offense, midshipmen found in violation of the Honor Concept by their peers can be separated from the Naval Academy.

===Naval Academy Foreign Affairs Conference (NAFAC)===

Since 1961, the academy has hosted the annual Naval Academy Foreign Affairs Conference (NAFAC), the country&#x27;s largest undergraduate, foreign-affairs conference. NAFAC provides a forum for addressing pressing international concerns and seeks to explore current issues from both a civilian and military perspective.

Each year a unique theme is chosen for NAFAC. Noteworthy individuals with expertise in relevant fields are then invited to address the conference delegates, who represent civilian and military colleges from across the United States and around the globe.

The entire conference is organized and run by midshipmen, who also serve as moderators, presenters, and delegates. The midshipman director is responsible for every aspect of the conference, including the conference theme, and is generally charged with leading a staff of over 250 midshipmen.

===Naval Academy Science and Engineering Conference (NASEC)===
The Naval Academy Science and Engineering Conference (NASEC), hosted annually since 2000, is an undergraduate STEM conference. Held in November each year, approximately 45 midshipmen join 150 attendees from other colleges and universities across the country meet and discuss significant science and engineering challenges. The delegates hear from leaders in scientific research and policy from academia, industry, and government, and participate in group discussions on the conference themes.

The conference serves as both a leadership opportunity for the midshipmen staff who organize and run the event, and as a venue to expose midshipmen to cutting-edge science and engineering challenges.

===McMullen Naval History Symposium===
Since 1973, the Naval Academy has hosted a major international conference for naval historians. In 2006 it was named after John J. McMullen, USNA Class of 1940.

===Small Satellite Program===

The United States Naval Academy (USNA) Small Satellite Program (SSP) was founded in 1999 to actively pursue flight opportunities for miniature satellites designed, constructed, tested, and commanded or controlled by midshipmen.

The USNA MidSTAR Program&#x27;s first satellite, MidSTAR I was launched 8 March 2007. The planned MidSTAR II was canceled.

===Postgraduate studies===
Because the majority of graduates commence directly into their military commissions, the Naval Academy offers no graduate degree programs. However, a number of programs allow midshipmen to obtain graduate degrees before fulfilling their service obligation. The Immediate Graduate Education Program (IGEP) allows newly commissioned Ensigns or Second Lieutenants to proceed directly to graduate school and complete a master&#x27;s degree. The Voluntary Graduate Education Program (VGEP) allows the midshipman to begin their studies the second semester of their senior year at a local university, usually University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins University, Georgetown University, or George Washington University, and complete the degree by the following semester. Midshipmen accepted into prestigious scholarships, such as the Rhodes Scholarship are permitted to complete their studies before fulfilling their service obligation. Finally, the Bowman Scholarship allows Navy Nuclear Power candidates to complete their master&#x27;s degrees at the Naval Postgraduate School before continuing into the Navy.

==Student activities==
===Athletics===


Participation in athletics is, in general, mandatory at the Naval Academy and most midshipmen not on an intercollegiate team must participate actively in intramural or club sports. There are exceptions for non-athletic Brigade Support Activities such as the YP Squadron (a professional surface warfare training activity providing midshipmen the opportunity to earn the Craftmaster Badge) or the Drum and Bugle Corps.

Varsity-letter winners wear a specially issued blue cardigan with a large gold &quot;N&quot; patch affixed. Teams that beat Army in a year are awarded a gold star to affix near the &quot;N&quot; for each such victory.

The U.S. Naval Academy&#x27;s varsity sports teams have no official name but usually are referred to in media as &quot;the Midshipmen&quot; (since all athletes are, in fact, midshipmen), or more informally as &quot;the Mids&quot;. The term &quot;middies&quot; is generally considered derogatory. The sports teams&#x27; mascot is a goat named &quot;Bill&quot;.

The Midshipmen participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I FBS as a member of the American Athletic Conference in football and in the NCAA Division I-level Patriot League in many other sports. The academy fields 33 varsity sports teams and 15 club sports teams (along with 19 intramural sports teams).

The most important sporting event at the academy is the annual Army–Navy Game, in football. The three major service academies (Navy, Air Force, and Army) compete for the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy, which is awarded to the academy that defeats the others in football that year (or retained by the previous winner in the event of a three-way tie). Keenan Reynolds (quarterback 2012–2015) set numerous Navy and NCAA records, including the FBS career rushing touchdown record, arguably becoming Navy&#x27;s best quarterback ever. Reynolds finished fifth in the prestigious Heisman Trophy voting. In the Army-Navy rivalry, Reynolds became the first quarterback to beat Army in four seasons.

Naval Academy sports teams have many accomplishments at the international and national levels. In 1926, Navy&#x27;s football team won the U.S. national championship based on both the Boand and Houlgate mathematical poll systems. and the Navy men&#x27;s lacrosse team won 21 USILL or USILA national championships and was the NCAA Division I runner-up in 1975 and 2004. The men&#x27;s fencing team won NCAA Division I championships in 1950, 1959, and 1962 and was runner-up in 1948, 1953, 1960, and 1963, and NCAA Division I championships were also earned by the 1945 men&#x27;s outdoor track and field team and the 1964 men&#x27;s soccer team.

The academy lightweight crew won the 2004 and 2021 National Championship. The lightweights are accredited with two Jope Cup Championships as well, finishing the Eastern Sprints with the highest number of points in 2006 and 2007. The college&#x27;s heavyweight crew won Olympic gold medals in men&#x27;s eights in 1920 and 1952, and from 1907 to 1995 at Intercollegiate Rowing Association regatta the team earned 30 championships. In intercollegiate shooting, the Naval Academy has won nine National Rifle Association rifle team trophies, seven air pistol team championships, and five standard pistol team titles. Navy&#x27;s squash team was the national nine-man team champion in 1957, 1959, and 1967, and the boxing team was National Collegiate Boxing Association champion in 1987, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2005.

There is an unofficial (but previous National Champion) croquet team. They compete most notably in the Annapolis Cup held every April since 1983 against students from St. John&#x27;s College, Annapolis. In 1982 the commandant of the U.S. Naval Academy told a Johnnie (slang for a student enrolled at St. John&#x27;s) that the Midshipmen could beat St. John&#x27;s at any sport. The St. John&#x27;s student selected croquet. Since then, thousands attend the annual croquet match between St. John&#x27;s and the 28th Company of the Brigade of Midshipmen (originally the 34th Company before the brigade was reduced to 30 companies). As of 2024, the Midshipmen had a record of 8 wins and 32 losses to the St John&#x27;s team.

===Other extra-curricular activities===

Midshipmen have the opportunity to participate in a broad range of other extracurricular activities including musical performance groups (Drum &amp; Bugle Corps, Men&#x27;s Glee Club, Women&#x27;s Glee Club, Gospel Choir, an annual musical, a midshipman orchestra, and a bagpipe band, the Pipes &amp; Drums), religious organizations, academic honor societies such as Omicron Delta Epsilon (an economics honor society), Campus Girl Scouts, the National Eagle Scout Association, a radio station (WRNV), and Navy and Marine Corps professional activities (diving, flying, seamanship, and the Semper Fidelis Society for future Marines). The midshipman theatrical company, &quot;The Masqueraders&quot;, put on one production annually in Mahan Hall. There is an intercollegiate debate team. Colleges from along the East Coast attend the annual U.S. Naval Academy Debate Tournament. Midshipmen also participate in the Sandhurst Competition, a military skills event.
The brigade began publishing a humor magazine called &quot;The Log&quot; in 1913. This magazine was discontinued in 2001 but returned to print in the fall of 2008. Among &quot;The Log&#x27;s&quot; usual features were &quot;Salty Sam&quot;, an anonymous member of the senior class who served as a gossip columnist, and the &quot;Company Cuties&quot;, photos of male midshipmen&#x27;s girlfriends. (This last was deemed offensive to women, and despite attempts to incorporate the boyfriends of female midshipmen in some issues, the &quot;Company Cuties&quot; were dropped from &quot;The Log&quot;″s format by 1991.) &quot;The Log&quot; was once featured in &quot;Playboy Magazine&quot; for its parody of the famous periodical, called &quot;Playmid&quot;. Playmid was an issue of &quot;The Log&quot; in 1989 and was ordered destroyed by Rear Admiral Virgil L. Hill Jr., the Academy Superintendent at the time, but a handful of copies survived. Earlier &quot;Log&quot; attempts to parody were much more successful, with the 18 April 1969 issue as the most famous; some sections of this issue can be seen online at an alumni website. In September 1949, &quot;The Log&quot; began publishing a half-sized &quot;Splinter&quot; bi-weekly, to alternate with its larger sized publication.

===Song===

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games is: &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, the United States Naval Academy fight song. According to &quot;College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology&quot; published in 1998, &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; ranks as the fifth greatest fight song of all time. &quot;Blue and Gold&quot; is the name of Naval Academy&#x27;s Alma Mater.

==Police==

The Naval District Washington-Naval Support Activity Annapolis Police Department, formerly known as the U.S. Naval Academy Police Department until 2010, is a full DOD law enforcement agency. It is composed of both DoD Department of Navy Civilian Police, and Navy Masters-at-Arms who are responsible for policing the U.S. Naval Academy complex. They enforce Maryland, federal and military law and local instructions, offer assistance to those in need, and provide a visible deterrent for criminal activity.
==Women and the Naval Academy==

The Naval Academy first accepted women as midshipmen in 1976, after Congress authorized the admission of women to all of the service academies. Women account for about 22 percent of entering plebes. They pursue the same academic and professional training as do their male classmates, except that certain physical aptitude standards for women are lower than for men, mirroring the standards of the Navy itself. Women have most recently composed about 17 percent of each graduating class, however this number continues to rise. The first pregnant midshipman graduated in 2009. While regulations expressly forbade this, the woman was able to receive a waiver from the Department of the Navy.

In 2006, Michelle J. Howard, class of 1982, became the first female graduate of the Naval Academy to be selected for admiral; she was also the first admiral from her class. Margaret D. Klein, class of 1981, became the first female commandant of midshipmen in December 2006.

Following the 2003 U.S. Air Force Academy sexual assault scandal and due to concern with sexual assault in the U.S. military the Department of Defense was required to establish a task force to investigate sexual harassment and assault at the United States military academies in the law funding the military for fiscal 2004. The report, issued 25 August 2005 showed that during 2004 50% of the women at Annapolis reported instances of sexual harassment while 99 incidents of sexual assault were reported. There had been an earlier incident in 1990 which involved male midshipmen chaining a female midshipman to a urinal and then taking pictures of her after she threw a snowball at them.

Academy Superintendent Vice Admiral Rodney Rempt issued a statement: &quot;With the benefit of the Defense Task Force&#x27;s assessment and recommendations, we will continue to strive to establish a climate which encourages reporting of these incidents, so we can support the victim and deal with allegations fairly and appropriately. The very idea that any member of the Naval Academy family could be part of an environment that fosters sexual harassment, misconduct, or even assault is of great concern to me, and it is contrary to all we are trying to do and achieve. Preventing and deterring this unacceptable behavior is a leadership issue that I and all the Academy leaders take to heart. The public trusts that the Service Academies will adhere to the highest standards and that we will serve as beacons that exemplify character, dignity and respect. We will increase our efforts to meet that trust.&quot; Superintendent Rempt was criticized in 2006 for not allowing former Navy quarterback Lamar Owens to graduate, despite his acquittal on a rape charge. Some alumni have attributed this to an overeagerness on Rempt&#x27;s part to placate critics urging a crackdown on sexual assault and harassment.

In 1979, James H. Webb published a provocative essay opposing the integration of women at the Naval Academy titled &quot;Women Can&#x27;t Fight&quot;. Webb was an instructor at the Naval Academy in 1979 when he wrote the article for Washingtonian magazine that was critical of women in combat and of them attending the service academies. The article, in which he referred to the dorm at the Naval Academy that housed 4,000 men and 300 women as &quot;a horny woman&#x27;s dream&quot;, was written three years after the academy admitted women. Webb said he did not write the headline.

On 7 November 2006, Webb was elected to the U.S. Senate from Virginia. His election opponent, then senator George Allen, raised the 1979 article as a campaign issue, depicting Webb as being opposed to women in military service. Webb&#x27;s response read in part, &quot;To the extent that my writings subjected women at the Academy or the active armed forces to undue hardship, I remain profoundly sorry.&quot; He then went on to assert: &quot;I am completely comfortable with the roles of women in today&#x27;s military.&quot; In a political advertisement for Allen five female graduates of the United States Naval Academy had said the article helped foster an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy.

The Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, on 21 December 2012, issued a statement of shame over a recent sexual abuse study which showed the nation&#x27;s service academies continue to have trouble maintaining safe teaching environments regarding sexual abuse. Reported sexual assaults the prior year declined from 22 to 13 at Annapolis. The former superintendent, Vice Admiral Mike Miller, enforced a new academy policy, as of January 2013, related to training, victim support, campus security, leadership presence on weekends, and a general review of alcohol policy based on other information in the recent report which shows the actual number of sexual assaults has not declined and that offenses are not reported.

In May 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris became the first female commencement speaker at the Naval Academy. 

Yvette M. Davids became the first female Superintendent of the Naval Academy on 11 January 2024.

==Traditions==
* &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; is a popular song written historically at the Naval Academy, subsequently coming to stand for the entire United States Navy. The lyrics are by Midshipman Alfred H. Miles, set to music by 2nd Lieutenant Zimmerman, USMC, bandmaster of the Naval Academy Band starting in 1887. After writing &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; they dedicated it to the Class of 1907. The song is sung during sporting events, pep rallies, and played by the Drum and Bugle Corps during noon meal formations. Members of the Navy and Marine Corps, unless marching, are supposed to come to attention while it is playing. The original verse (quoted below) is learned by midshipmen as plebes.
* &quot;Blue and Gold&quot; is the name of Naval Academy&#x27;s Alma Mater. The song is sung at the conclusion of every sporting event, at the end of pep rallies and at alumni gatherings. It is also sung in most companies by the plebes at the conclusion of the day during Plebe Summer and end of the week during the academic year; this event is also referred to as &quot;Blue and Gold&quot;, which is a short gathering to review the day for better or worse with the upperclass midshipmen.
* &quot;Herndon Monument Climb&quot; – a year-end informal ritual (analogous to the &quot;cover toss&quot; at graduation) marking the passage from plebe to third-classman. The new upperclassmen raise a classmate to the top of the monument to replace a dixie cup sailor cover with the combination cover traditional to midshipmen. For the event, Herndon is covered with lard. Only teamwork will result in the changing of caps. In 2008, the dixie cup removed and the cover placed belonged to Midshipman Kristen Dickmann, Class of 2011, who had died a few days previously. These were the first women&#x27;s caps used for the Climb.

==Notable alumni==

Graduates include over 50 U.S. astronauts, including six who flew to the Moon, more than from any other undergraduate institution in the U.S. Over 990 noted scholars in a variety of academic fields are Academy graduates, including 46 Rhodes Scholars and 24 Marshall Scholars. Alumni include one President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, who is also a Nobel laureate, as is Albert A. Michelson (1907 – Nobel Prize in Physics). 73 alumni have earned the Medal of Honor.

<doc id="59769" wikidata="Q23079" url="?curid=59769" title="Northumberland">
<text>Northumberland ( ) is a ceremonial county in North East England, on the border with Scotland. It is bordered by the North Sea to the east, Tyne and Wear and County Durham to the south, Cumbria to the west, and the Scottish Borders council area to the north. The town of Blyth is the largest settlement. Northumberland is the northernmost county in England.

The county has an area of and a population of 320,274, making it the least-densely populated county in England. The south-east contains the largest towns: Blyth (37,339), Cramlington (27,683), Ashington (27,670), and Morpeth (14,304), which is the administrative centre. The remainder of the county is rural, and the largest towns are Berwick-upon-Tweed (12,043) in the far north and Hexham (13,097) in the west. For local government purposes the county is a unitary authority area. The county historically included the parts of Tyne and Wear north of the River Tyne.

The west of Northumberland contains part of the Cheviot Hills and North Pennines, while to the east the land becomes flatter before reaching the coast. The Cheviot (), after which the range of hills is named, is the county&#x27;s highest point. The county contains the source of the River North Tyne and much of the South Tyne; near Hexham they combine to form the Tyne, which exits into Tyne and Wear shortly downstream. The other major rivers in Northumberland are, from south to north, the Blyth, Coquet, Aln, Wansbeck and Tweed, the last of which forms part of the Scottish border. The county contains Northumberland National Park and two national landscapes: the Northumberland Coast and part of the North Pennines.

Much of the county&#x27;s history has been defined by its position on a border. In the Roman era most of the county lay north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and the region was contested between England and Scotland into the Early Modern era, leading to the construction of many castles, peel towers and bastle houses, and the early modern fortifications at Berwick-upon-Tweed. Northumberland is also associated with Celtic Christianity, particularly the tidal island of Lindisfarne. During the Industrial Revolution the area had significant coal mining, shipbuilding, and armaments industries.

==History==
===Name origin===

The name of Northumberland is recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as &quot;norð hẏmbra land&quot;, meaning &quot;the land north of the Humber&quot;. The name of the kingdom of &quot;Northumbria&quot; derives from the Old English meaning &quot;the people or province north of the Humber&quot;, as opposed to Southumbria, south of the Humber Estuary.

===Before the county===

The land has long been an English frontier zone, and it is now bordered to the north by Scotland. Northumberland has a rich prehistory with many instances of rock art, hillforts such as Yeavering Bell, and stone circles such as the Goatstones and Duddo Five Stones. Most of the area was occupied by the Brythonic-Celtic Votadini people, with another large tribe, the Brigantes, to the south.

During the Roman occupation of Britain, most of the present county lay north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. It was controlled by Rome only for the brief period of its extension of power north to the Antonine Wall. The Roman road Dere Street crosses the county from Corbridge over high moorland west of the Cheviot Hills to Melrose, Scottish Borders (). As evidence of its border position through medieval times, Northumberland has more castles than any other county in England, including prominent ones at Alnwick, Bamburgh, Dunstanburgh, Newcastle, and Warkworth.

Nearly 2000-year-old Roman boxing gloves were uncovered at Vindolanda in 2017 by the Vindolanda Trust experts, led by Andrew Birley. Being similar in style and function to the full-hand modern boxing gloves, those found at Vindolanda look like leather bands dating back to 120 AD. It is suggested that, based on their difference from gladiator gloves, the gloves were not used in mortal combat, but rather in a sport for promoting fighting skills. The gloves are currently displayed at Vindolanda&#x27;s museum.

Present-day Northumberland formed the core of the Anglian kingdom of Bernicia from about 547. It was united with Deira (south of the River Tees) to form the kingdom of Northumbria in the 7th century. The boundaries of Northumbria under King Edwin (reigned 616–633) stretched from the Humber in the south to the Forth in the north. Northumberland is often called the &quot;cradle of Christianity&quot; in England because Christianity flourished on Lindisfarne—a tidal island north of Bamburgh, also called Holy Island—after King Oswald of Northumbria (r. 634–642) invited monks from Iona to come to convert the English. The monastery at Lindisfarne was the centre of production of the Lindisfarne Gospels (around 700). It became the home of St Cuthbert (c. 634–687, abbot from c. 665), who is buried in Durham Cathedral.

The Kingdom of Northumbria fragmented into a series of successor states following the Viking invasion. In the south, Viking settlers established the Kingdom of York between the Humber and Tees. However, Viking influence petered out at the Tees, with the river serving as the northern boundary of the Danelaw. Between the Tyne and Tees rivers, the Community of St. Cuthbert emerged as the successors to the Bishops of Lindisfarne; north of the Tyne, the earls of Bamburgh, who traced their lineage back to the Kings of Northumbria, continued to exercise authority and governance over this northern expanse. York was eventually integrated as a shire into the unified Kingdom of England by the House of Wessex. However, the West Saxon governmental structures were not extended beyond Tees, leaving the Earldom of Bamburgh and the Community of St. Cuthbert as contested buffer states with the emerging Kingdom of Scotland.
After the battle of Nechtansmere, Northumbrian influence north of the Tweed began to decline as the Picts gradually reclaimed the land previously invaded by the Anglian kingdom. In 1018, its northern part, the region between the Tweed and the Forth (including Lothian, which includes present-day Edinburgh), was ceded to the Kingdom of Scotland.

===As a county===
The Earldom of Northumberland was briefly held by the Scottish royal family by marriage, between 1139–1157 and 1215–1217. Scotland relinquished all claims to the region as part of the Treaty of York (1237). The earls of Northumberland once wielded significant power in English affairs because, as powerful and militaristic Marcher Lords, they had the task of protecting England from Scottish retaliation for English invasions.

Northumberland has a history of revolt and rebellion against the government, as seen in the Rising of the North (1569–1570) against Elizabeth I. These revolts were usually led by the earls of Northumberland, the Percy family. Shakespeare makes one of the Percys, the dashing Harry Hotspur (1364–1403), the hero of his &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;. The Percys were often aided in conflict by other powerful Northern families, such as the Nevilles and the Patchetts. The latter were stripped of all power and titles by the victorious Parliamentarians after the English Civil War of 1642–1651.

After the Restoration in 1660, the county was a centre for Roman Catholicism in England, as well as a focus of Jacobite support. Northumberland was long a wild county, where outlaws and Border Reivers hid from the law. However, the frequent cross-border skirmishes and accompanying local lawlessness largely subsided after the Union of the Crowns of Scotland and England under King James I and VI in 1603.

Northumberland played a key role in the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century on. Many coal mines operated in Northumberland until the widespread closures in the 1970s and 1980s. Collieries operated at Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth, Choppington, Netherton, Ellington, and Pegswood. The region&#x27;s coalfields fuelled industrial expansion in other areas of Britain, and the need to transport the coal from the collieries to the Tyne led to the development of the first railways. Shipbuilding and armaments manufacture were other important industries before the deindustrialisation of the 1980s.

Northumberland remains largely rural, and is the least densely populated county in England. In recent years, the county has had considerable growth in tourism. Visitors are attracted both to its scenic beauty and to its historical sites.

==Geography==

Northumberland has a diverse physical geography. It is low and flat near the North Sea coast and increasingly mountainous towards the northwest. Being in the far north of England, above 55° latitude, and having many areas of high land, Northumberland is one of the coldest areas of the country. But as the county lies on the east coast, it has relatively low rainfall, with the highest amounts falling on the high land in the west.

About a quarter of the county forms the Northumberland National Park, an area of outstanding landscape that has largely been protected from development and agriculture. The park stretches south from the Scottish border and includes Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Most of the park is over above sea level. The Northumberland Coast is also a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). A small part of the North Pennines AONB is also in the county.

There is a variety of nature reserves in Northumberland including Holy Island National Nature Reserve and Farne Islands National Nature Reserve. Moreover, 50% of England&#x27;s red squirrel population lives in the Kielder Water and Forest Park.

Natural England recognises the following natural regions, or national character areas, that lie wholly or partially within Northumberland:

* North Northumberland Coastal Plain
* South East Northumberland Coastal Plain
* Cheviot Fringe
* Cheviot Hills
* Northumberland Sandstone Hills
* Mid Northumberland
* Tyne Gap and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall
* Border Moors and Forests
* Tyne and Wear Lowlands

===Geology===
The Cheviot Hills, in the northwest of the county, consist mainly of resistant Devonian granite and andesite lava. A second area of igneous rock underlies the Whin Sill (on which Hadrian&#x27;s Wall runs), an intrusion of Carboniferous dolerite. Both ridges support a rather bare moorland landscape. Either side of the Whin Sill the county lies on Carboniferous Limestone, giving some areas of karst landscape. Lying off the coast of Northumberland are the Farne Islands, another dolerite outcrop, famous for their bird life.

The Northumberland Coalfield extends across the southeast corner of the county, from the River Tyne as far north as Shilbottle. There were smaller-scale workings for coal within the Tyne Limestone Formation as far north as Scremerston. The term &#x27;sea coal&#x27; likely originated from chunks of coal, found washed up on beaches, that wave action had broken from coastal outcroppings.

===Green belt===
Northumberland&#x27;s green belt is in the south of the county, surrounding Cramlington and other communities along the county border, to afford a protection from the Tyneside conurbation. The belt continues west along the border, past Darras Hall, and on to Hexham, stopping before Haydon Bridge. Its border there is shared with the North Pennines AONB. There are also some separated belt areas, for example to the east of Morpeth. The green belt was first drawn up in the 1950s.

==Politics==
===County town===

The historic county town was Alnwick; assizes were mainly held in Newcastle, with the county gaol in Morpeth. Newcastle became a city in 1400, with county corporate status, with both areas having joint assizes.

From the county council&#x27;s formation in 1889 until 1981 Newcastle was the county town, being briefly the county town of two counties when the city became a part of the Tyne and Wear metropolitan county in 1974. The county council has been governed from Morpeth since 1981. In 2009 the county council became a unitary authority when the county&#x27;s districts were abolished and the county council took on their functions.

===Council===
The unitary authority of Northumberland Council was established in April 2009. Previously, the county had a two-tier council system for the county and its six districts, both responsible for different aspects of local government. These districts were Blyth Valley, Wansbeck, Castle Morpeth, Tynedale, Alnwick and Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Elections for the unitary authority council first took place on 1 May 2008. The most recent elections, in 2021, had the following results:

===Constituencies===

Northumberland is divided into four parliamentary constituencies: Berwick-upon-Tweed, Blyth Valley, Wansbeck and Hexham. The 2019 general election produced the following total votes, with changes since previous election:



===2016 European Union Referendum===

On 23 June 2016 Northumberland took part in the UK-wide referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the EU. In Northumberland a majority voted to leave the European Union. The only one of the four parliamentary constituencies in Northumberland to vote Remain was Hexham.

==Demography==

At the 2001 UK Census Northumberland registered a population of 307,190, estimated to be 309,237 in 2003, The 2011 UK Census gave a population of 316,028.

In 2001 there were 130,780 households, 10% of the population were retired, and one-third rented their homes. Northumberland has an ethnic minority population at 0.985% of the population, far lower compared to the average of 9.1% for England as a whole. In the 2001 UK Census, 81% of the population reported their religion as Christianity, 0.8% as &quot;other religion&quot;, and 12% as having no religion.

Being primarily rural with significant areas of upland, the population density of Northumberland is only 62 persons per square kilometre, giving it the lowest population density in England.

==Economy==

Northumberland&#x27;s industry is dominated by some multinational corporations: Coca-Cola, MSD, GE and Drager all have significant facilities in the region.

Tourism is a major source of employment and income in Northumberland. In the early 2000s the county annually received 1.1 million British visitors and 50,000 foreign tourists, who spent a total of £162 million.

Coal mining in the county goes back to Tudor times. Coal mines continue to operate today; many of them are open-cast mines. Planning approval was given in January 2014 for an open-cast mine at Halton Lea Gate near Lambley.

A major employer in Northumberland is Hexham-based Egger (UK) Limited.
===Pharmaceuticals, health care and biotechnology===
Pharmaceutical, health care and emerging biotechnology companies form a very significant part of the county&#x27;s economy. Many of these companies are part of the approximately 11,000-worker Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) and include Aesica Pharmaceuticals, Arcinova, MSD, Piramal Healthcare, Procter &amp; Gamble, Shire Plc (formerly SCM Pharma), Shasun Pharma Solutions, Specials Laboratory, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. The cluster also includes Cambridge Bioresearch, GlaxoSmithKline, Fujifilm Diosynth Biotech, Leica Bio, Data Trial, High Force Research, Non-Linear Dynamics, and Immuno Diagnostic Systems (IDS). The towns of Alnwick, Cramlington, Morpeth, Prudhoe all have significant pharmaceutical factories and laboratories.

Newcastle University and Northumbria University are the leading academic institutions nearby. The local industry includes commercial or academic activity in pre-clinical research and development, clinical research and development, pilot-scale manufacturing, full-scale active pharmaceutical ingredient/intermediate manufacturing, formulation, packaging, and distribution.

===Media===
Having no large population centres, the county&#x27;s mainstream media outlets are served from nearby Tyne and Wear, including radio stations and television channels (such as BBC Look North, BBC Radio Newcastle, ITV Tyne Tees and Hits Radio North East), along with the majority of daily newspapers covering the area (&quot;The Journal&quot;, &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot;). It is worth remembering however that although Northumberland, like many administrative areas in England, has been shorn of its geographical regional centre, that centre—Newcastle upon Tyne—remains an essential element within the entity we know as Northumberland. Newcastle&#x27;s newspapers are as widely read in its Northumbrian hinterland as any of those of the wider county: the &quot;Northumberland Gazette&quot;, &quot;Morpeth Herald&quot;, &quot;Berwick Advertiser&quot;, &quot;Hexham Courant&quot; and the &quot;News Post Leader&quot;.

Lionheart Radio, a community radio station based in Alnwick, has recently been awarded a five-year community broadcasting licence by Ofcom.

===Businesses===
Ashington has the former Alcan Lynemouth Aluminium Smelter, next to the Lynemouth Power Station. Hammerite and Cuprinol are made in Prudhoe by ICI Paints. A Procter &amp; Gamble factory in Seaton Delaval makes Hugo Boss aftershave and Clairol and Nice &#x27;n Easy hair dye at a site formerly owned by Shultons, who originated Old Spice and were bought by P&amp;G in 1990. McQuay UK makes air conditioning systems on the Bassington Industrial Estate at the A1068/A1172 junction in Cramlington, and Avery Dennison UK make labels on the Nelson Industrial Estate off of the A192. Schweppes&#x27; Abbey Well mineral water is made by Coca-Cola in the east of Morpeth. The National Renewable Energy Centre (Narec) is at Blyth.

==Settlements==
===Parishes===
NOTE: New parishes have been added since 2001. These are missing from the list, see List of civil parishes in Northumberland. 
Although not on this list, the population of Cramlington is estimated at 39,000.

===Historic areas===

Some settlements that are part historic county of Northumberland now fall under the county of Tyne and Wear:

==Sport==
===Football===
A precursor of modern football is still seen in the region at some annual Shrove Tuesday games at Alnwick. In 1280 at Ulgham near Morpeth Northumberland, records show that Henry of Ellington was killed playing football when David Le Keu&#x27;s knife went into Henry&#x27;s belly and killed him. Organised football teams as we know today did not appear until the 1870s. Newcastle United Football Club was formed in 1892 by uniting Newcastle West End FC with Newcastle East End.

Newcastle United were first division champions three times in the early 20th century, reaching the FA Cup Final three times before winning it at the fourth attempt in 1910.
Today top quality professional football remains in Northumberland. Since the 2017 – 18 season, Newcastle United is a Premier League team. St James&#x27; Park in Newcastle is a first class football venue, often used for international games at all levels. Blyth Spartans A.F.C. have had success and public attention through Football Association Cup runs.

====Notable associated footballers====
There are many notable footballers from the county, pre Second World War and immediate post war greats were George Camsell and Hughie Gallacher, these were described in the &quot;Clown Prince of Football&quot; by Len Shackleton. The author played for Newcastle United and Northumberland County Cricket Club. Shackleton&#x27;s book was controversial when it was first published because chapter 9, named &quot;The Average Director&#x27;s Knowledge of Football&quot;, was produced as a blank page. Notable players after the Second World War included Joe Harvey, Jackie Milburn, Brian Clough and Newcastle&#x27;s Bobby Moncur who led his team to win the Inter City Fairs Cup in 1969.

Two of Jackie Milburn&#x27;s nephews from Ashington, Bobby Charlton and Jackie Charlton are perhaps the two most significant players for England. Bobby joined Manchester United and Jackie Leeds United both contributing much to the success and history of their respective clubs. They both became permanent fixtures in Alf Ramsey&#x27;s 1966 England World Cup winning team. Malcolm Macdonald was a successful Newcastle player of the 1970s. Great national players who played at Northumberland clubs in the 1980s and 1990s include Peter Beardsley, Paul Gascoigne, Chris Waddle and Alan Shearer. Shearer remains the highest scoring player in Premier League history with 260 goals in 441 appearances.

===Horseracing===
Early races were held at Newcastle&#x27;s Killingworth Moor from 1632 before moving to the Town Moor. The &#x27;Pitmen&#x27;s Derby&#x27; or Northumberland Plate was held from 1833 and moved to Gosforth in 1882. Modern day horse racing still takes place at Newcastle Racecourse.

===Golf===
Golf is a Scottish import to many countries, but it is said to have been played in this region by St Cuthbert on the dunes of the Northumberland coast. The oldest club in Northumberland was at Alnmouth, founded in 1869, it is the fourth oldest in the country and is now Alnmouth Village Club; it is a 9 hole links course.

There is one old links course at Goswick. It is a James Braid design which is widely acknowledged as a classic Northumberland links course; so much so, that the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&amp;A) chose Goswick as a regional qualifier for the Open Championship for five years from 2008.

During the English Civil War of 1642–1651, King Charles played &#x27;Goff&#x27; in the Shield Fields suburb of Pandon during his imprisonment in the town.

Today inland golf courses are abundant in the county,

The county has a professional golfer who has played in many professional golf tour events: Kenny Ferrie from Ashington, who has won events on the prestigious European Tour.

===Other===
The annual Great North Run, one of the best known half marathons in which thousands of participants run from Newcastle to South Shields. In 2013 the 33rd Great North Run had 56,000 participants most of whom were raising money for charity.

==Education==
Northumberland has a completely comprehensive education system, with 15 state schools, two academies and one independent school. Like Bedfordshire, it embraced the comprehensive ideal with the three-tier system of lower/middle/upper schools with large school year sizes (often around 300). This eliminated choice of school in most areas: instead of having two secondary schools in one town, one school became a middle school and another became an upper school. A programme introduced in 2006 known as Putting the Learner First has eliminated this structure in the former areas of Blyth Valley and Wansbeck, where two-tier education has been introduced. Although the two processes are not officially connected, the introduction of two tiers has coincided with the move to build academy schools in Blyth, with Bede Academy and in Ashington at Hirst. One response to these changes has been the decision of Ponteland High School to apply for Trust status.

Cramlington Learning Village has almost 400 pupils in each school year, making it one of the largest schools in England. The Blyth Academy in southeast Northumberland can hold 1,500 students throughout the building. Astley Community High School in Seaton Delaval, which accepts students from Seaton Delaval, Seaton Sluice and Blyth, has been the subject of controversial remarks from politicians claiming it would no longer be viable once Bede Academy opened in Blyth, a claim strongly disputed by the headteacher. Haydon Bridge High School, in rural Northumberland, is claimed to have the largest catchment area of any school in England, reputedly covering an area larger than that encompassed by the M25 motorway around London.

The county of Northumberland is served by one Catholic high school, St Benet Biscop Catholic Academy in Bedlington, which is attended by students from all over the area. Students from Northumberland also attend independent schools such as the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle.

==Culture==

Northumberland has traditions not found elsewhere in England. These include the rapper sword dance, the clog dance and the Northumbrian smallpipe, a sweet chamber instrument, quite unlike the Scottish bagpipe. Northumberland also has its own tartan or check, sometimes referred to in Scotland as the Shepherd&#x27;s Tartan. Traditional Northumbrian music has more similarity to Lowland Scottish and Irish music than it does to that of other parts of England, reflecting the strong historical links between Northumbria and the Lowlands of Scotland, and the large Irish population on Tyneside.

The border ballads of the region have been famous since late mediaeval times. Thomas Percy, whose celebrated &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; appeared in 1765, states that most of the minstrels who sang the border ballads in London and elsewhere in the 15th and 16th centuries belonged to the North. The activities of Sir Walter Scott and others in the 19th century gave the ballads an even wider popularity. William Morris considered them to be the greatest poems in the language, while Algernon Charles Swinburne knew virtually all of them by heart.

One of the best-known is the stirring &quot;Chevy Chase&quot;, which tells of the Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s vow to hunt for three days across the Border &quot;maugre the doughty Douglas&quot;. Of it, the Elizabethan courtier, soldier and poet Sir Philip Sidney famously said, &quot;I never heard the old song of Percy and Douglas that I found not my heart moved more than with a trumpet&quot;. Ben Jonson said that he would give all his works to have written &quot;Chevy Chase&quot;.

Overall the culture of Northumberland, as with the North East of England in general, may have more in common with Scottish Lowland culture than with that of Southern England. Both regions have their cultural origins in the old Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria, a fact borne out by the linguistic links between the two regions. These include many Old English words not found in other forms of Modern English, such as &quot;bairn&quot; for child (see Scots language and Northumbrian dialect).

The lands just north or south of the border have long shared certain aspects of history and heritage; it is thus thought by some that the Anglo-Scottish border is largely political rather than cultural.

Attempts to raise the level of awareness of Northumberland culture have also started, with the formation of a Northumbrian Language Society to preserve the unique dialects (Pitmatic and other Northumbrian dialects) of this region, as well as to promote home-grown talent.

Northumberland&#x27;s county flower is the bloody crane&#x27;s-bill (&quot;Geranium sanguineum&quot;) and its affiliated Royal Navy ship is its namesake, .

===Flag===

The historic county of Northumberland has its own flag, which is a banner of the arms of Northumberland County Council. The shield of arms is in turn based on the arms medieval heralds had attributed to the Kingdom of Bernicia (which the first County Council used until it was granted its own arms). The Bernician arms were fictional but inspired by Bede&#x27;s brief description of a flag used on the tomb of St Oswald in the 7th century.

The current arms were granted to the county council in 1951, and adopted as the flag of Northumberland in 1995.

<text>Eisenach () is a town in Thuringia, Germany with 42,000 inhabitants, located west of Erfurt, southeast of Kassel and northeast of Frankfurt. It is the main urban centre of western Thuringia and bordering northeastern Hessian regions, situated near the former Inner German border. A major attraction is Wartburg castle, which has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999.

Eisenach was an early capital of Thuringia in the 12th and 13th centuries. St.Elizabeth lived at the court of the Ludowingians here between 1211 and 1228. Later, Martin Luther came to Eisenach and translated the Bible into German. In 1685, Johann Sebastian Bach was born here. During the early modern period, Eisenach was a residence of the Ernestine Wettins and was visited by numerous representatives of Weimar classicism like Johann Wolfgang Goethe. In 1869, the SDAP, one of the two precursors of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) was founded in Eisenach.

Car production is an important industry in Eisenach. The &quot;Automobilwerk Eisenach&quot; was founded in 1896. In the German Democratic Republic, the Wartburg was produced here, before the factory was acquired by Opel in 1990.

Eisenach is situated on the Hörsel river, a tributary of the Werra between the Thuringian Forest in the south, the Hainich mountains in the north-east and the East Hesse Highlands in the north-west. Since January 2021, it is part of the Wartburgkreis.

==History==
=== Middle Ages ===
Eisenach&#x27;s origin and early history is unknown. An 8th century Frankish settlement near Petersberg hill is regarded as the nucleus of Eisenach. However, there are no written sources about that early period. According to legend, Louis the Springer began in 1067 to establish Wartburg castle above the settlement.

In 1080, the castle was first mentioned in a Saxon chronicle. Eisenach itself followed in a document dating to 1150 where it was referred to as &quot;Isinacha&quot;. During the 1180s, the town was established by the construction of three independent market settlements around the Saturday&#x27;s market (today&#x27;s Karlsplatz), the Wednesday&#x27;s market (today&#x27;s Frauenplan) and the Monday&#x27;s market (today&#x27;s Marktplatz). Due to its convenient location at a bottleneck between the Thuringian Forest in the south and the Hainich mountains in the north, Eisenach benefitted from substantial west-east trade along Via Regia from Frankfurt to Erfurt and Leipzig and became a rich merchant town. During the second half of the 12th century, the town walls were erected (the Nikolaitor is an important relict of this wall) and Eisenach got a planned grid of streets and alleys. In the late 12th century, the Wartburg became the main residence of the Ludowingians, making Eisenach a leading place in today&#x27;s western Thuringia and northern Hesse, which also belonged to the Ludowingian landgraviate. In 1207, the legendary Sängerkrieg supposedly took place at Wartburg castle.

In 1221, St. Elizabeth married Landgrave Louis&#x27; IV and she lived in Eisenach or at Wartburg castle until 1228. Later, she became the patroness of Thuringia and Hesse.

In 1247, the Ludowingians died out which led to the War of the Thuringian Succession between the Wettins and Duchess Sophie of Brabant. As a consequence, the landgraviate was divided. Eisenach and the eastern parts went to the Wettins (later becoming Thuringia) and Kassel, Marburg and the western parts went to Sophie (later becoming Hesse). Eisenach kept a leading position among the Wettin&#x27;s Thuringian cities by becoming their &quot;Oberhof&quot; (leading court), so that their law had to be derived from Eisenach&#x27;s municipal law and disputes had to be resolved here. The confident citizens of Eisenach fought against the Wettin&#x27;s rule to become a free imperial city between 1306 and 1308, but lost. In the 14th century various crises followed: in 1342, a big fire destroyed nearly all the buildings and the Black Death killed many inhabitants in 1349 and 1393. Since 1406, Eisenach was no longer a Wettin residence, which led to a decline in urban development. In 1485, in the &quot;division of Leipzig&quot;, the town fell to the Ernestine line of the Wettins.

=== Early-modern period ===

Between 1498 and 1501, the young Martin Luther attended the St. George&#x27;s Latin school in Eisenach in preparation for his following studies at the University of Erfurt. In 1521/22 he was hidden by Frederick the Wise at Wartburg castle to protect him from the Imperial ban. In that time, Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German, in what was an important step both for the German Reformation and the development of a consistent German standard language.

Luther referred to Eisenach as &quot;ein Pfaffennest&quot; (&quot;a clerical backwater&quot;), since during his time there were 300 monks and nuns per 1,000 inhabitants.

In 1525, there was heavy fighting in the area during the &quot;Bauernkrieg&quot;.
In 1528, the Lutheran Reformation was implemented in Eisenach. In 1596, Eisenach became a ducal residence again for the house of Saxe-Eisenach.

Johann Sebastian Bach was born in Eisenach in 1685, when it was a part of the Holy Roman Empire. His father, Johann Ambrosius Bach worked here as a musician at that time. Other famous composers and musicians associated with Eisenach during that period were Johann Pachelbel, Johann Christoph Bach and Georg Philipp Telemann. As the Eisenach dukes died out in 1741, the town and the state became part of Saxe-Weimar. Nevertheless, the cultural life stayed unimpaired. The coterie around the poet met up with famous personalities like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Christoph Martin Wieland in Eisenach.

From 1809 to 1918, Eisenach was part of the Duchy (after 1815 Grand Duchy) of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.

=== After 1815 ===
In 1817, the Wartburg Festival took place in Eisenach, a meeting of students advocating moves towards a more liberal, constitutional state and a unification of Germany. The industrial revolution started relatively early in Eisenach. As early as the first half of the 19th century, the first factories were founded. In 1847, Eisenach was connected by the Thuringian Railway to Erfurt and Halle/Leipzig in the east and in 1849 to Kassel and Frankfurt in the west. In 1858, the Werra Railway to Lichtenfels (and further to Nuremberg) was opened.

In August 1869, the leading socialists August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht founded the SDAP, one of the two predecessors of today&#x27;s SPD in Eisenach. The Eisenach Program remained the party&#x27;s main manifesto for the following years. The late 19th and early 20th century was the period with the fastest urban growth in Eisenach. The &quot;Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach&quot; (FFE), later &quot;Automobilwerk Eisenach&quot;, basis of car production in Eisenach, was founded in 1896, the first trams ran in 1897, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;fraternity monument&quot;) was erected in 1902 and the J. S. Bach museum opened in 1907. Tourists also started to arrive in this period, drawn by the pleasing landscape and the various sights within the town.

Between the 1860s and 1938, Eisenach hosted one of the largest Jewish communities in Thuringia with nearly 500 members at the beginning of the 20th century. Many Jews migrated from the Rhön area around Stadtlengsfeld to Eisenach after their emancipation in the early 19th century. The new synagogue was built in 1885 and destroyed by the Nazis during &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in November 1938. Most Jews emigrated at that time, others were deported to concentration camps and murdered there. During Nazi Germany the Institute for the Study and Elimination of Jewish Influence on German Church Life, an antisemitic propaganda institute, was set up in Eisenach by eleven German Protestant churches, founded at the instigation of the German Christian movement.

Before the Second World War, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG had produced motorcycles in the town. In preparation for World War II, new barracks were established in Eisenach and the car industry started the production of military equipment. After 1940, around 4,000 forced labourers (most of them from the Soviet Union) were pressed to work in the town&#x27;s factories, where some of them died due to the bad working conditions. Postwar, the managing director of the BMW aircraft engine works, Dr Schaaf, told the Fedden Mission there were as many as 11,000 working in the town, 4,500 in a plant inside a hillside turning out BMW 132 engines and parts for the 801, the rest in town. The bombings during the war destroyed about 2,000 housing units and big parts of the car factories, as well as some historic buildings in the town centre, which were rebuilt soon after the war. The US Army arrived in Eisenach on 6 April 1945, but the Soviets took over control of the town on 1 July 1945, making it Communism&#x27;s westernmost major town.

Eisenach was part of the GDR after 1949. The Inner German border ran only ten kilometres west of Eisenach and was closed in 1952, cutting off parts of Eisenach&#x27;s traditional hinterland. The location near the border inhibited the further development during the next 40 years and the population declined through that period. Nevertheless, Eisenach remained an important industrial location. The BMW car factory was socialized and under the new name EMW produced the Wartburg, the so-called &quot;Mercedes of the East&quot;. The deteriorating condition of many historic houses led to a housing shortage during the 1970s. The government fought this by demolishing some historic quarters (e.g. at Jakobstraße) and rebuilding them with &quot;Plattenbau&quot; settlements. The biggest &quot;Plattenbau&quot; district was built at the northern periphery of Eisenach between 1978 and 1985 with nearly 4,000 housing units. In 1975, the tramway system was discontinued.

After German reunification in 1990, the economic situation changed. The car factory was taken over by Opel, whereas many other factories were closed. On the other hand, Eisenach moved from the inner German border to the centre of the reunified country. Tourism saw significant growth and the Wartburg castle was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. Nevertheless, the financial situation of Eisenach remained difficult, unemployment stayed above average and car production suffered from the business problems of Opel.

== Geography and climate==
=== Topography ===
Eisenach is situated at the northern edge of the Thuringian Forest, at an elevation of about 220 m. The terrain is hilly, to the south also mountainous (up to 460 m of elevation), with the central Hörsel valley crossing the town in east-western direction. The Nesse river enters the Hörsel river in Eisenach after forming a valley through the spur of the Hörselberg mountains in the eastern municipal territory. The northern territory around the Neunkirchen, Stregda and Hötzelsroda districts is relatively flat and in agricultural use. Approximately west of the town centre runs the wide Werra valley, where the Hörsel river enters this bigger river near Hörschel district. The southern municipal territory is covered with forest, same as some smaller parts north of the Hörsel river. The Hainich mountains begin north-east of Eisenach.

=== Administrative division ===
Eisenach abuts the municipalities Krauthausen, Mihla, Lauterbach, Bischofroda and Berka vor dem Hainich in the north, Hörselberg-Hainich and Wutha-Farnroda in the east and Marksuhl, Wolfsburg-Unkeroda and Gerstungen in the south (all situated in the district Wartburgkreis) and Werra-Meißner-Kreis (Hesse, municipality of Herleshausen in the west). The municipal border between Eisenach and Herleshausen was part of the inner German border/Iron Curtain from 1949 to 1990.

The municipality of Eisenach includes beside the inner town the following rural districts (all of them were incorporated in 1994):
* Berteroda
* Göringen
* Hörschel
* Hötzelsroda
* Madelungen
* Neuenhof
* Neukirchen
* Stedtfeld
* Stockhausen
* Stregda
* Wartha
The village of Fischbach was incorporated in 1922 and is a part of the inner town today.

=== Climate ===
Eisenach has a humid continental climate (Dfb) or an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system. Summers are warm and sometimes humid, winters are relatively cold. The town&#x27;s topography creates a microclimate with mostly adequate air circulation along the west-eastern valley which made Eisenach a resort at the end of the 19th century. Annual precipitation is with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long in the inner town valley.

== Demographics ==

Eisenach has always been one of the larger towns in Thuringia with 4,000 to 5,000 inhabitants during the Middle Ages. By 1800, the population rose to 8,000 and further to 10,000 as industrialisation started around 1850. In 1875, the town had 16,000 inhabitants, 30,000 in 1900, 43,000 in 1925 and more than 50,000 in 1940, as the peak was reached. Like the most other east German mid-sized towns, Eisenach has had a shrinking population since 1950. It declined to 48,000 in 1990, 44,000 in 2000 and 42,000 in 2012. During the last few years (2009–2012), the annual change was . Suburbanization played only a small role in Eisenach. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas are situated within the administrative town borders.

The birth deficit was 240 in 2012, or -5.7 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +6.5 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin of people who have moved to Eisenach are rural areas of Thuringia as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.

Like in other eastern German cities, only a small share of Eisenach&#x27;s population is foreign: circa 2.3% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 4.9% are classified as &quot;migrants&quot; (according to the 2011 EU census). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Eisenach are Vietnamese, Russians and Ukrainians.

Due to the official atheism of the former German Democratic Republic, most of the population is non-religious: 23.0% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 4.4% are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census).

== Economy==
=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
The region around Eisenach is the part of Thuringia with the strongest economic base.

Agriculture is not very important in Eisenach, because of the hilly terrain, the—compared to central Thuringia further east—less fertile soil and the relatively humid climate. However, 43% of the total municipal territory are in agricultural use, mostly as maize and rapeseed fields or as cattle pasture.

The industrial structure is relatively focused on car production. The German auto manufacturer Opel built an entirely new plant in the northwest of the town, after the Wartburg car plant had ceased production in 1991. The new plant opened in 1992. Most other large manufacturers in Eisenach serve as suppliers for Opel, the largest among them is Bosch. BMW runs a factory in the neighbouring municipality of Krauthausen that supplies car parts. Another component supplier is &quot;Truck-Lite Europe&quot;. In 2012, there were a total of 19 industrial companies with more than 20 workers in Eisenach, employing 5,600 people and generating a turnover of more than 1.8 billion euros. Of those employees, 3,000 work for just two companies (Opel and Bosch), underlining the dependence of Eisenach on the automotive industry.

Services in Eisenach are focused on tourism with 166,000 overnight visitors spending a total of 311,000 nights in hotels in 2012. In addition, there are large numbers of (mostly German) one-day visitors.

Eisenach also provides services to the region (retail, hospitals, theatres, cinemas etc.).

During recent years, the economic situation of the town improved: the unemployment rate declined from 17% in 2005 to 9% in 2013.

==Attractions==
The Wartburg castle is, aside from Weimar, the most-visited tourist attraction in Thuringia. Further sights are:

=== Museums ===
Eisenach hosts a number of museums:
* The &quot;Bachhaus&quot; at Frauenplan was the first museum worldwide to be dedicated to the life and work of Johann Sebastian Bach in 1906. It was established through the Neue Bachgesellschaft. The house is over 600 years old and stands near the site of the house in the Rittergasse, which is directly in back of the museum, where Bach was born on 31 March 1685. Today, a 2007 expansion has been added to the museum and it holds several artifacts and a variety of 18th and 19th century musical instruments.
* The &quot;Lutherhaus&quot; at Lutherplatz is one of the oldest half-timbered buildings remaining in Eisenach. Martin Luther is said to have lived here as a pupil during his school days in Eisenach from 1498 to 1501 as a guest of the Cotta family. The building was destroyed in a fire in 1944 but had been completely rebuilt by 1966. Currently, this house is a museum featuring multimedia exhibits relating to the period. The museum is split into five parts illustrating Luther&#x27;s life and times as well as his teachings. 
* &quot;Automobile Welt&quot; at Friedrich-Naumann-Straße exhibits the tradition of car production in Eisenach since 1898. It includes the Wartburg cars of 1899–1991, AWE racing cars from 1956 and classic BMW cars.
* The &quot;Thüringer Museum&quot; inside the palace at Marktplatz is the art-historical museum of Eisenach and shows a collection focusing on porcelain and art handicrafts.
* The &quot;Reuter-Wagner-Museum&quot; at Reuterweg hosts an exhibition on the poet Fritz Reuter and the composer Richard Wagner. Built by Ludwig Bohnstedt between 1866 and 1868, this neo-renaissance house was the home of Fritz Reuter, a well-known poet of the Low German dialect, from 1868 until his death in 1874. Reuter&#x27;s home was acquired by the town in 1895 and turned into a memorial. That same year the collection of Nicolaus Oesterlein containing several thousand books on Richard Wagner (virtually the complete primary and secondary literature on Wagner of the 19th century) was added. Since 1997, this collection—the second largest in the world after Bayreuth—has been presented in a new exhibit on the ground floor, which also includes all the material on &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, an opera set at the Wartburg.
* The museum inside the &quot;Predigerkirche&quot; at Predigerplatz hosts the medieval art division of the &quot;Thüringer Museum&quot;.
* The &quot;Goldener Löwe&quot; at Marienstraße shows an historical exhibition of German social democracy. On 7 August 1869 the Social Democratic Worker&#x27;s Party (later to become the &quot;Social-Democratic Party of Germany&quot;) was founded at this site. The &quot;August Bebel Society&quot; offers lectures and seminars on topics of historical and current political interest.

=== Townscape ===

The town of Eisenach developed during the Middle Ages at the exit of &quot;Mariental&quot; valley, opening to the Hörsel valley around Marktplatz, Karlsplatz and Frauenplan in a triangle structure. The early-modern period brought extensions to the west (Katharinenstraße), to the north (Jakobstraße) and to the east (in front of Nikolaitor gate). The construction boom between 1850 and 1914 led to a strict division in urban development. South of the historic centre, mansion districts were established on the hillsides of Mariental valley, where the rich factory owners, rentiers and other upper-class people lived. These districts are among the most important examples of this urban type in Germany, and one of the largest in Europe. North of the historic centre, next to the railway and Hörsel river, factories and worker quarters were established. These also host some examples of interesting Gründerzeit architecture. After World War I, the town extended further to the north on the other bank of Hörsel river, where some new residential areas were developed before 1990.

====Square ensembles====
* &quot;Karlsplatz&quot;: adjoins the Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas) and the Romanesque Nikolaitor (St. Nicholas Gate), the only surviving town gate (out of five). The square is seen as the nucleus of the town, it was first mentioned in 1368.
* &quot;Marktplatz&quot;: the market square with the Georgenkirche (Church of St. George), the town hall, the Baroque &quot;Stadtschloss&quot;, as well as a number of highly decorative administration buildings and merchants&#x27; houses. It also features the gilded market fountain designed by Hans Leonardt in 1549, showing St. George, the patron saint of Eisenach.
* &quot;Jakobsplan&quot;: named after a chapel destroyed by fire in the Middle Ages. Jakobsplan comprises a monument to St. George in the centre of the square, part of the old town walls (including one of the watch towers), and the Goethe Garden.
* &quot;Frauenplan&quot;: a small courtyard-type square that takes its name from the &quot;Church of Our Lady&quot;. The church was demolished for defence purposes in 1306. Today Frauenplan is the location of the &quot;Bachhaus&quot; and the Bach monument in front of it.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* &quot;St. George&#x27;s Church&quot; (Lutheran) at the market square was first built in the 12th century. The church in which St. Elisabeth was married was demolished in 1515 and replaced by a new structure. Martin Luther held a sermon there on 2 May 1521. In 1525, the church was heavily damaged during the &quot;Bauernkrieg&quot; and during the Reformation it served as a stables. It was rededicated in 1558. On 23 March 1685, Johann Sebastian Bach was baptized in the church (the 16th century baptismal font still remains). The tower was added in 1898–1902. 
* &quot;St. Nicholas&#x27; Church&quot; (Lutheran), located on the Karlsplatz, served the Benedictine convent once located in the area. This triple-naved basilica was built in 1180. It is considered the latest example of Romanesque architecture in Thuringia.
* &quot;Preachers&#x27; Church&quot; (secularized) at Predigerplatz was part of a former Dominican monastery (founded in 1240 and the only monastery buildings of which remain in the town), today used as a museum for medieval art. 
* &quot;St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Church&quot; (Roman Catholic) at Sophienstraße is the Catholic parish church of Eisenach, built in neo-Gothic style in the 1880s. 
* &quot;St. Anne&#x27;s Church&quot; (Lutheran) at Georgenstraße was founded together with a hospital by St. Elizabeth in 1226. 
* &quot;St. Clement&#x27;s Chapel&quot; (Lutheran) at Clemensstraße is a small 13th century Romanesque chapel.
* &quot;Holy Cross Church&quot; (secularized) at the old cemetery was built in the 1690s.

==== Castles and palaces ====
* The most important castle is the Wartburg above the town. For further information, see: Wartburg. 
* The &quot;Stadtschloss&quot; (town palace) is situated at the north end of the Marktplatz and was built between 1742 and 1745. This palace was constructed to the plans of Gottfried Heinrich Krohne, architect of Duke Ernst August I of Saxe-Weimar. After 1777 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe frequently stayed here in his capacity as the duke&#x27;s prime minister. Today the Stadtschloss acts as a venue for special exhibitions and as a museum for artistic and historical artifacts from Thuringia.
* &quot;Hellgrevenhof&quot; at Georgenstraße is part of a former inner-town castle, named after Heinrich Hellgreve, a rich citizen who lived here in the late 13th century. It consists of five buildings, the oldest dating to around 1200, although it has been modified several times over the centuries. 
* &quot;Bechtolsheim Palace&quot; at Jakobsplan is a neoclassical palace, built in the late 18th century. 
* &quot;Schloss Fischbach&quot; in Fischbach district is a small 17th-century castle.
* &quot;Jagdschloss Hohe Sonne&quot; is a hunting lodge south of the city in the Thuringian Forest. It was built in the mid-18th century in the Baroque style. 
* &quot;Alte Residenz&quot; at Esplanade is the relic of the former ducal residence, rebuilt in the Renaissance style after older predecessors.

==== Memorials ====
* The &quot;Bach monument&quot; was constructed in 1884 by Adolf von Donndorf. Financed by other well-known musicians, the more-than-life-size figure portrays Johann Sebastian Bach in his St. Thomas&#x27;s choir-master&#x27;s clothes and wig. It is situated on the Frauenplan next to the &quot;Bachhaus&quot;.
* The &quot;Martin Luther monument&quot; at Karlsplatz was designed by Adolf von Donndorf and was dedicated on 4 May 1895 on the 374th anniversary of Luther&#x27;s arrival at Wartburg castle. The more-than-life-size statue of Martin Luther on a pedestal also has reliefs depicting events of his life leading up to and including his stay in Eisenach as well as the title of one of his most famous hymns, &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; (&quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot;).
* The &quot;Burschenschaftsdenkmal&quot; (literally: &quot;Monument to Student Fraternities&quot;) on Göpelskuppe hill was built in 1902. The monument stands on a hill opposite the Wartburg in memory of the members of the liberal and nationalistic student movement and others who were killed in the struggle for a united Germany between 1864 and 1871. The monument that reaches a height of 33 meters and proclaims &quot;Honour, Freedom, and Fatherland&quot;, was dedicated on 22 May 1902 and was extended in 1933 to honour those who fell in World War I. Since reunification, fraternities again have been meeting in Eisenach in memory of the demonstrations held at the Wartburg in the past.
* &quot;The “Dejudaization Institute” Memorial&quot; was unveiled on May 6, 2019 at the beginning of Bornstrasse. A plaque with text, which is integrated in the memorial, acknowledges the churches’ guilt, summarizes the &quot;Dejudaization Institute’s&quot; work and impact, and remembers the victims of the church’s anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism.

==== Other sights ====
* The town walls were built during the 13th century and demolished in the 19th century. Remains visible today are the &quot;Nikolaitor&quot; and the &quot;Glockenturm&quot;. 
* The &quot;Kartausgarten&quot; is all that remains of the original Carthusian monastery, consecrated to St. Elizabeth in 1380. In 1700 it became a royal kitchen garden and around 1800 was changed into a park. The &quot;Wandelhalle&quot; (covered walk and foyer), built in 1906, was originally intended as a pump room to a spa planned for Eisenach that never materialised.
* The &quot;town hall&quot; at Marktplatz was a former wine cellar and became the townhall of Eisenach in 1596. The building, having been destroyed by fire in 1636, was rebuilt in 1641. The southern part of the complex suffered considerable damage in a bombing raid in 1945 during World War II. It was renovated in 1996 and it now houses the municipal administration offices. 
* The &quot;Landestheater&quot; (state theatre) was established in 1879 by Julius von Eichel-Streiber and constructed to the design of the Leipzig architect Karl Weichardt. It was later renovated in 1993. The theatre holds an audience of 600 and has two balconies. 
* The &quot;narrow house&quot; may be the narrowest half-timbered house in Germany. It was built before 1750 and is only 2.05 meters wide. Inside visitors can view a small exhibition. Notably, Bach composed several sonnets here as he liked the acoustics of the house.

==Politics==
===Mayor and city council===
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Hans-Peter Brodhun of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who served from 1990 to 2000. He was succeeded by fellow CDU member Gerhard Schneider from 2000 and 2006. Matthias Doht of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) was elected mayor in 2006. In 2012, Katja Wolf of The Left won the mayoralty, becoming the first female mayor in Eisenach&#x27;s history. After defecting to the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance in 2023, she retired as mayor to run for the 2024 Thuringian state election. The most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2024, with a runoff held on 9 June, and the results were as follows:

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Eisenach is twinned with:

* Marburg, Germany (1988)
* Sedan, France (1991)
* Waverly, Iowa, United States (1992)
* Skanderborg, Denmark (1993)
* Mogilev, Belarus (1996)
* Sárospatak, Hungary (2008)
==Infrastructure==

=== Transport ===


Eisenach is connected by the Thuringian Railway to Erfurt and Halle/Leipzig to the east and to Kassel and Frankfurt to the west. Furthermore, there is the Werra Railway, a former main-line railway between north and south Germany from Eisenach via Meiningen to Eisfeld, which since the division of Germany after World War II has served only for regional transport. At the former inner German border, it is still interrupted between Eisfeld and Coburg, but rebuilding is in discussion. Eisenach Hauptbahnhof is a stop of all long-distance trains from Frankfurt to Leipzig/Dresden, running once an hour. Local trains, also once an hour, start in Eisenach to Halle via Erfurt, to Sonneberg via Meiningen and Eisfeld and to Bebra via Gerstungen. Freight transport is important at Eisenach&#x27;s Opel factory which has its own terminal. Further local passenger stations are Eisenach-West, Eisenach-Opelwerk and Hörschel.

Eisenach is located on the Bundesautobahn 4 from Frankfurt in the west to Erfurt and Dresden in the east. Since 2010, the Autobahn has been moved to a new route farther away from the town to protect the residents from noise and air pollution. Moreover, it was not possible to expand the old route because of the mountainous topography. After 2010, parts of the old route became a town highway, whereas other parts were renaturalized. A second Autobahn between Eisenach and Kassel is in construction (Bundesautobahn 44). There are four Bundesstraßen connecting Eisenach: The Bundesstraße 7 runs to Kassel in the north-west, whereas its eastern branch to Gotha was annulled in 2010. The Bundesstraße 19 leads to Meiningen in the south, the Bundesstraße 84 to Bad Langensalza in the north-east and to Fulda via Vacha in the south-west and the Bundesstraße 88 is a connection to Ilmenau in the south-east. Furthermore, there are two important secondary roads to Mühlhausen via Mihla in the north and to Herleshausen in the west through the Hörsel valley. Downtown traffic is concentrated on Rennbahn street, which often leads to congestion due to a large number of commuters and the town&#x27;s narrow topography.

The next local airports are the Erfurt-Weimar Airport, about to the east and the Kassel Calden Airport, roughly to the north-west. Both offer service to tourist destinations. The next major international airport is Frankfurt Airport, circa to the south-west. Kindel Airfield, east of Eisenach, is a former Soviet military base, today used for private aviation.

Biking is getting more and more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Long distance trails include the &quot;Werra trail&quot;, the &quot;Rennsteig trail&quot; and the &quot;Radweg Thüringer Städtekette&quot; (&quot;Thuringian town string trail&quot;). These all connect points of touristic interest, the first along the Werra valley from the Thuringian Forest to the Weser river in Hann. Münden, the second through the Thuringian Forest along its crest to the Saale river near Hof and the third follows near the medieval Via Regia from the Werra valley/Eisenach via Gotha, Erfurt and Weimar to Altenburg.

Public transport in Eisenach is by a bus network servicing the downtown areas as well as the neighbouring towns and villages. The three-line tramway system of Eisenach was in operation between 1897 and 1975.

== Education ==
After reunification, the educational system was reformed. Eisenach currently has six state-run and one Protestant primary schools.

There are two types of secondary school in Germany. The gymnasium prepares students for higher education at a university and students graduate after a total of 12 or 13 years of education with an Abitur. There are two public and one evangelical gymnasium in Eisenach named after personalities of the cities history:
* &quot;Elisabeth Gymnasium&quot; (named after St. Elisabeth. This public gymnasium is partner school for the handball project of the local ThSV Eisenach handball club which is one of clubs playing in Germany&#x27;s first league (&quot;Handball Bundesliga&quot;). Students can specialise in science, languages or music &amp; art and are offered an intense course in economics &amp; law in year 11 and 12).
* &quot;Ernst Abbe Gymnasium&quot; (named after Ernst Abbe. This public gymnasium offers specialisations in science and languages and offers its student a &quot;MINT&quot; - math, IT, science, technology - certificate, similar to a degree in STEM fields.
* &quot;Luther Gymnasium&quot; (named after Martin Luther. In addition to its religious focus, this Protestant gymnasium offers specialisations in science and languages. Career guidance and a diaconal internship are part of year 11 and 12).

Another form of secondary school is the &quot;Realschule&quot; where students graduate after a total of ten years of education. There are four public and one free sponsored &quot;Realschulen&quot; in Eisenach.

In addition, there is one Waldorf school where education spans from primary school to gymnasium.

In 1998, the &quot;Berufsakademie Eisenach&quot; was founded. The roughly 600 students can obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree there, either in economics or in technics.

==Sport==
ThSV Eisenach is a professional handball club that plays in the second division.

The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft supercharged four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/38-8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-490&quot; was not fitted with torpedo tubes or deck guns, but had two SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns with 2500 rounds as well as a C/30 guns with 3000 rounds.

==Operational career==
&quot;U-460&quot; conducted six patrols. As a supply boat, she avoided combat.

===First and second patrols===
&quot;U-460&quot;″s first patrol started with her departure from Kiel on 7 June 1942, taking her out to mid-Atlantic through the gap between Iceland and the Faeroe Islands. She arrived in St. Nazaire in occupied France on 31 July.

Her second foray, which began on 27 August 1942, saw her steam west out of the Bay of Biscay, south, then south southeast toward the Cape Verde Islands in the South Atlantic.

===Third, fourth and fifth patrols===
&quot;U-460&quot;″s third patrol was due west from St. Nazaire and lasted 39 days, a typical length.

Her fourth sortie was almost a repeat of her third, except it terminated in Bordeaux.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-461&quot; was a Type XIV supply and replenishment U-boat (&quot;Milchkuh&quot;) of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II.

Her keel was laid down on 9 December 1940, by Deutsche Werke in Kiel as yard number 292. She was launched on 8 November 1941 and commissioned on 30 January 1942 with &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Hinrich-Oscar Bernbeck in command. Bernbeck was promoted to &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; by 21 April 1942, when he was relieved by &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Wolf-Harro Stiebler.

==Design==
German Type XIV submarines were shortened versions of the Type IXDs they were based on. &quot;U-461&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft supercharged four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/38-8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-461&quot; was not fitted with torpedo tubes or deck guns, but had two SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns with 2500 rounds as well as a C/30 guns with 3000 rounds. The boat had a complement of fifty-three.

==Operational career==
&quot;U-461&quot; conducted six patrols. As a supply boat, she avoided combat.

===First and second patrols===
&quot;U-461&quot;″s first patrol took her from Kiel to St. Nazaire in occupied France, via the gap between Iceland and the Faeroe Islands and out into the mid-Atlantic.

Her second patrol was much like her first; the most westerly point in the Atlantic was reached on 30 September 1942.

===Third and fourth patrols===
&quot;U-461&quot;″s third sortie commenced with her departure from St. Nazaire on 19 November 1942. Travelling south, she reached the furthest spot in the patrol which was roughly between South America and Africa. There, she spent two days (according to her position reports), before moving a short distance west on 11 December 1942. She returned to her French base on 3 January 1943.

She steamed to a point west of the Canary Islands, which she reached on 2 March 1943. Having departed St. Nazaire on 13 February, she returned there for the last time on 22 March.

===Fifth patrol===
She left St.Nazaire on 20 April 1943, but was attacked on the return leg on 23 April by a Canadian Wellington of 172 squadron RAF, equipped with a Leigh Light. Three bombs were dropped, resulting in slight damage and, more seriously, a trail of oil. She returned to France, but this time to Bordeaux.

===Sixth patrol and loss===
She had left Bordeaux on 27 July 1943, but was hardly out of the Bay of Biscay, north-west of Cape Ortegal, Spain, when she was sunk on 30 July by an Australian Sunderland flying boat from No. 461 Squadron RAAF piloted by Flight Lieutenant Dudley Marrows. Coincidentally this aircraft had the registration &quot;U&quot;, also making it known as &#x27;U-461&#x27;. As a result of the attack, all 12 Australian crew on the flying boat agreed to drop an inflatable dinghy, fifteen of her crew survived; 53 were killed.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-461&quot; took part in three wolfpacks, namely:
* Wolf (26 July – 1 August 1942) 
* Vorwärts (16 – 20 September 1942) 
* Rochen (26 February – 1 March 1943)

Her keel was laid down on 2 January 1941, by Deutsche Werke in Kiel. She was launched on 29 November 1941 and commissioned on 5 March 1942 with &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Bruno Vowe in command. Vowe commanded the boat until she was lost. She served, first as part of the 4th U-boat Flotilla while carrying out training, then as part of the 10th and 12th flotillas while taking part in operations.

==Design==

The boat had a complement of fifty-three.

==Operational career==
&quot;U-462&quot; conducted eight patrols. As a supply boat, she avoided combat.

===First patrol===
For her first patrol, &quot;U-462&quot; departed Kiel on 23 July 1942 and arrived at St. Nazaire in occupied France on 21 September of the same year, having travelled by way of the gap between Iceland and the Faeroe Islands and out into the Atlantic. The latter part of the voyage took her past the Azores on her way to her new base.

===Second and third patrols===
The U-boat&#x27;s second effort took her to a point west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands which she reached on 9 November 1942. She arrived back at St. Nazaire on 7 December 1942.

Her third outing was very short. She left Bordeaux on 20 January 1943, but returned on the 22nd.

===Fourth and fifth patrols===
The submarine&#x27;s fourth sortie took her out into the Atlantic once again. The most westerly spot of this patrol was recorded on 27 February 1943. She returned to France, but this time it was to Bordeaux, on 11 March.

The boat&#x27;s fifth patrol was also routine.

===Sixth patrol===
She did not leave the Bay of Biscay, being attacked by Mosquito aircraft of 151 and 156 squadrons, RAF on 21 June 1943. One man was killed (&quot;Matrosengefreiter&quot; Ferdinand Brunnbaur), and four more were wounded. The patrol was aborted, the boat returned to Bordeaux on the 23rd.

===Seventh patrol===
&quot;U-462&quot;″s seventh patrol was also cut short. She had barely cleared the northwest Spanish coast when she was attacked by a British B-24 Liberator of 224 squadron, RAF. After sustaining sufficient damage to force a return, she entered Bordeaux harbour on 6 July 1943.

===Loss===
On 30 July 1943, &quot;U-462&quot; was sunk by a British Halifax bomber of 502 Squadron RAF and gunfire from the British sloops , , , and , in the Bay of Biscay. One of these ships, &quot;Kite&quot;, registered a hit at . One crewman was killed; the other 64 survived.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-462&quot; took part in one wolfpack, namely:
* Lohs (29 August – 2 September 1942)

<text>German submarine &quot;U-463&quot; was a Type XIV supply and replenishment U-boat (&quot;Milchkuh&quot;) of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II.

Her keel was laid down on 8 March 1941 by Deutsche Werke of Kiel. She was launched on 20 December 1941 and commissioned on 2 April 1942 with &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Leo Wolfbauer in command. Wolfbauer remained in charge for the boat&#x27;s entire career.

==Design==
German Type XIV submarines were shortened versions of the Type IXDs they were based on. &quot;U-463&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft supercharged four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/38-8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-463&quot; was not fitted with torpedo tubes or deck guns, but had two SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns with 2500 rounds as well as a C/30 guns with 3000 rounds. The boat had a complement of fifty-three.

==Operational career==
&quot;U-463&quot; conducted five patrols. As a supply boat, she avoided combat.

===First patrol===
&quot;U-463&quot; departed Kiel on her first patrol on 11 July 1942, arriving at St. Nazaire in occupied France on 3 September. She had gone the &#x27;long&#x27; way round the British Isles, by way of the gap between Iceland and the Faeroe Islands, heading out into mid-Atlantic toward the Caribbean.

===Second, third and fourth patrols===
Her second foray took her into the middle of the Atlantic again, between 28 September 1942 and 11 November.

The submarine&#x27;s next sortie was further south, passing the Azores on the outward journey to the north and to the south on the return. By now she was based at St. Nazaire once more.

Another uneventful patrol began on 4 March 1943, but when the U-boat returned to France on 17 April, she moved into Bordeaux.

===Fifth patrol and loss===
&quot;U-463&quot;″s fifth patrol began with her departure from Le Verdon, (north of Bordeaux): She had barely cleared the Bay of Biscay, when she was attacked and sunk on 16 May 1943 by depth charges dropped by a British Halifax from 58 Squadron RAF Coastal Command, piloted by Wing Commander Wilfrid Oulton. All 57 of her crew died.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-463&quot; took part in one wolfpack, namely:
* Delphin (11 – 14 January 1943)

<text>German submarine &quot;U-464&quot; was a Type XIV supply and replenishment U-boat (&quot;Milchkuh&quot;) of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II.

Her keel was laid down on 18 March 1941, by Deutsche Werke in Kiel as yard number 295. She was launched on 20 December 1941 and commissioned on 30 April 1942 with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Otto Harms in command. He remained in charge for her entire career.

The boat began her service life training in the 4th U-boat Flotilla before moving on to the 10th flotilla for operations.

The boat had a complement of fifty-three.

==Operational career==
&quot;U-464&quot; was lost on her first patrol. As a supply boat, she avoided combat. She transited from Kiel to Bergen in Norway, arriving on 9 August 1942.

===First and only patrol===
&quot;U-464&quot; set-off for her first patrol from Bergen on 14 August 1942. On the 20th, she was attacked south south-east of Iceland by a US PBY Catalina flying boat of VP-73. Two crew members were killed, there were 52 survivors. Although the aircraft dropped all its bombs without sinking the boat, she was still capable of making eight knots but was unable to dive. With many other ships and aircraft in the vicinity and realizing that the situation was hopeless, Harms decided to scuttle the boat near an Icelandic trawler, the 60 GRT &quot;Skaftfellingur&quot;.

What happened next is still open to question.

&quot;English and Icelandic sources&quot; on &#x27;Uboat.net&#x27; say that the 52 German submariners were picked up by the seven-man crew of the fishing boat, put in the bows and covered by a machine gun on the bridge. They were then transferred to a pair of British destroyers later that same day.

The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; officially published a different version: namely that the U-boat crew boarded the trawler by force, captured its crew, and were heading for Germany when they were intercepted by the destroyers and taken prisoner.

In July 1999 a squadron of German Navy submarines visited Reykjavík to honor the Icelandic seamen who rescued the U-boat crew.

In 1942, Captain (later Admiral) Daniel V. Gallery was commander of the US PBY anti-submarine base in Keflavik, Iceland. Chapter 1 of his 1976 book &quot;Clear The Decks&quot; contains a detailed description of the &quot;U-464&quot; incident with the Icelandic trawler which confirms the Kriegsmarine account. Some background: &quot;U-464&quot; was the first of eight confirmed U-boat sinkings by Gallery&#x27;s PBY squadron. Due to several botched attacks prior to this, Gallery had closed his base&#x27;s Officers Club.

During the era of the closed club Lieutenant Hopgood, en route to meet a convoy coming up from England, caught the &quot;U-464&quot; surfaced about from the convoy and crippled her so she couldn&#x27;t submerge, but could still limp along on the surface. Hopgood expended all his depth charges on his first attack, and his single .30 caliber gun was useless against the sub&#x27;s thick skin and heavy AA battery. In the messy weather the sub soon shook off our circling plane by running into a fog bank. Meantime, a British destroyer left the convoy at full speed in answer to Hoppy&#x27;s radio report of his attack. Hopgood flew toward the convoy until he found the speeding destroyer, advised her how to steer, and then flew back to hunt for the U-boat again. By this time the fog had lifted a bit and he found the sub, heading for an Icelandic fishing vessel a few miles away. As Hopgood circled, the sub went alongside the little trawler and the Nazis boarded the fishing vessel, abandoned and scuttled the U-boat, and laid a course toward Germany. Hoppy duly reported all this by radio and spent the next couple of hours shuttling back and forth between the trawler and the oncoming destroyer, coaching the destroyer how to steer.

This was an exciting three hours in all the R.A.F. and Royal Navy operations rooms in England, as well as in ours up in Iceland. Hoppy&#x27;s first electrifying messages telling that he had a cripple on his hands but couldn&#x27;t finish it off had brought everybody in England to the operations rooms. For the rest of the morning Vice Admirals, Air Marshals and their staffs sat with their ears glued to the radio following the dramatic developments at sea. Hoppy&#x27;s radio reports right up to the final one had been masterpieces of correct official phraseology giving a terse, clear and complete picture of all the essential details of the changing action as it occurred. Finally he came through with the big punch line that we were waiting for: &quot;Destroyer is alongside trawler and has taken off fifty-two prisoners.&quot; Then, shifting from code to plain English he continued, &quot;Personal message for Commander Gallery: Sank Sub—open club!&quot;

We opened the club all right. We damned near blew the roof off the joint. But Coastal Command Headquarters in London were a bit puzzled over that final message, and even after the Air Commodore, Iceland, explained it to them, they considered it &quot;most extraordinary.&quot;

http://www.vpnavy.org/vp73_1940.html (search page for &quot;Hopgood&quot;) confirms Gallery&#x27;s account. For his actions that day, Lt. Hopgood was awarded the US Navy Cross.

===Second patrol and loss===
Her second patrol saw her leave Bordeaux on 15 June 1943. On 13 July, &quot;U-487&quot; was attacked in the central Atlantic by five United States Navy Grumman TBF Avengers and Grumman F4F Wildcats from the escort carrier . The U-boat&#x27;s crew were taken by surprise, so much so that sunbathers were seen on the casing. One Wildcat was shot down, but 31 men were killed and the U-boat sunk. The 33 survivors were taken prisoner on board .

<text>German submarine &quot;U-488&quot; was a Type XIV supply and replenishment U-boat (&quot;Milchkuh&quot;) of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II.

Its keel was laid down on 3 January 1942 by Germaniawerft in Kiel as yard number 557. It was launched on 17 October 1942 and commissioned on 1 February 1943, with &quot;Leutnant zur See&quot; Erwin Bartke in command. Bartke was promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; by February 1944; he was relieved by &quot;Oblt.z.S.&quot; Bruno Studt.

The boat&#x27;s service began with training under the 4th U-boat Flotilla and culminated with the 12th flotilla for operations.

==Design==
German Type XIV submarines were shortened versions of the Type IXDs they were based on. &quot;U-488&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft supercharged four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/38-8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-488&quot; was not fitted with torpedo tubes or deck guns, but had two SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns with 2500 rounds as well as a C/30 guns with 3000 rounds. The boat had a complement of fifty-three.

==Operational career==
&quot;U-488&quot; conducted three patrols. As a supply boat, it avoided combat.

===First patrol===
&quot;U-488&quot;″s first patrol commenced when it left Kiel on 18 May 1943. It cleared the British Isles, sailing through the gap between the Faroe Islands and Iceland and out into the central Atlantic. On the return journey, it passed to the north-west of the Azores and reached Bordeaux in occupied France on 10 July 1943.

===Second patrol===
It was attacked on its second patrol on 12 October 1943 by two Avengers from the escort carrier . The aircraft claimed a sinking, but &quot;U-488&quot; was able to continue its mission.

On 15 October, &quot;Maschinenmaat&quot; Karl Bergmann died of an illness. On 25 November, &quot;Matrosenobergefreiter&quot; Heinz Heinlein fell overboard. He was rescued, but died of heart failure shortly afterwards.

The U-boat returned to Bordeaux on 12 December 1943.

===Third patrol and loss===
The boat departed Bordeaux for the last time on 22 April 1944. &quot;U-488&quot; was sunk with all hands (64 dead) on the 26th in the mid-Atlantic west of Cape Verde by depth charges from the American destroyer escorts , , and .

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-488&quot; took part in one wolfpack, namely:
* Trutz (6 – 12 June 1943)

==Operational career==
&quot;U-489&quot;″s only patrol began with her departure from Kiel on 22 July 1943. She headed for the Atlantic by way of the so-called Faeroes Gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, north of the British Isles.

She was attacked by a PBY Catalina flying boat of No. 190 Squadron RAF on 3 August. During the action, the &#x27;Cat&#x27; was hit twice and retired. Her crew were obliged to jettison depth charges and on their return, found the rudder cables almost severed. Her place was taken by a Lockheed Hudson of 269 Squadron, which succeeded in damaging &quot;U-489&quot;.

Although as a supply boat, she avoided combat, she was lost on her first patrol when on 4 August, she was attacked by a Canadian Sunderland flying boat of No. 423 Squadron RCAF, south-east of Iceland. The Sunderland was shot down, five of the eleven man crew were killed; &quot;U-489&quot; was sunk. 53 of her crew escaped. All the survivors were picked up by the destroyers and ; they had both observed the attack.

Her keel was laid down on 22 November 1940 by Deutsche Werke in Kiel as yard number 290. The submarine was launched on 13 September 1941 and commissioned on 15 November, with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Georg von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff in command; he remained in charge until the boat was lost, receiving promotion to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; in the process.

The boat had a complement of fifty-three.

==Operational career==
&quot;U-459&quot; conducted six patrols, but as a supply boat, she avoided combat. The submarine initially served in the 4th U-boat Flotilla, for training, before moving on to the 10th (in April 1942) and the 12th flotillas (in November of the same year), for operations.

===First and second patrols===
Having moved from Kiel to Helgoland &quot;U-459&quot; set-off for occupied France, arriving in St. Nazaire on 15 May 1942, after traversing the north-central Atlantic. Her captain, von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, was 48, one of the oldest skippers at the time.

Her second patrol began on 6 June 1942. It was at about this time that von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf was promoted to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot;.

===Third and fourth patrols===
Her third foray saw the boat sail into the south Atlantic, as far as Namibia. She departed St. Nazaire on 18 August 1942 and returned on 4 November.

Her fourth patrol was her longest, from 20 December 1942 to 7 March 1943, a total of 78 days. She started in St. Nazaire and finished in Bordeaux. This voyage included sailing toward Cameroon, the boat&#x27;s nearest position to that country was reached on 18 January 1943. On 4 September 1942 U-459 shared rations with the survivors in a lifeboat from the sunken freighter SS California which had been torpedoed by Italian sub Reginaldo Giuliani 13 August 1942

===Fifth and sixth patrols and loss===
Her fifth patrol began when she left Bordeaux on 20 April 1943. On 30 May, she shot down a British Whitley aircraft of (10 OTU RAF) (Crew rescued). She was also attacked, on the same day, by an RAF Liberator with a total of ten depth charges. &quot;U-459&quot; was not damaged but her AA guns caused slight damage to the attacking Liberator. She returned to her French base on 30 May.

After departing Bordeaux on 22 July 1943, &quot;U-459&quot; was attacked on 24 July near Cape Ortegal, Spain, by two British Wellington aircraft of No. 172 Squadron RAF. The boat shot down one of the Wellingtons (5 KIA 1 survived) but 18 submarine crewmen were killed during the action. &quot;U-459&quot; was crippled when a Wellington of No. 547 Squadron RAF, damaged by flak, crashed into the starboard side of the boat. The damage was so severe that she had to be scuttled. The rear gunner of the Wellington, Sergeant A. A. Turner, was the only survivor of the aircraft. Norman Franks wrote that Commander von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff was seen on the bridge, saluting his crew before disappearing into the conning tower hatch to complete the scuttling. He seemingly made no attempt to escape, going down with his command. The 41 survivors of the crew were taken prisoner.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-459&quot; took part in one wolfpack, namely:
* Eisbär (25 August – 1 September 1942)

<text>Farmer In The Sky is a 1950 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein about a teenaged boy who emigrates with his family to Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede, which is in the process of being terraformed. Among Heinlein&#x27;s juveniles, a condensed version of the novel was published in serial form in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine (August, September, October, November 1950), under the title &quot;Satellite Scout&quot;. The novel was awarded a Retro Hugo in 2001.

Passing references by the lead character to the song &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; and to its author, Rhysling, have caused some to consider it part of Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Future History&quot; series.

==Plot summary==

In the future, food is carefully rationed on an overcrowded Earth. Teenager William (Bill) Lermer lives with his widowed father, George. George decides to emigrate to the farming colony on Ganymede, one of Jupiter&#x27;s moons. After marrying Molly Kenyon, George embarks with Bill and Molly&#x27;s daughter Peggy on the &#x27;torchship&#x27; &quot;Mayflower&quot;. On the journey, Bill saves his bunkmates from asphyxiation by improvising a patch when a meteor punctures their compartment. During the trip, all the children attend class; also, to combat the boredom of the long trip, the Boy Scouts among the passengers form troops.

When they arrive on Ganymede, an unpleasant surprise awaits the newcomers. The arriving group is much larger than the colony can easily absorb. The soil has to be built from scratch by pulverizing boulders and lava flows, then seeding the resulting dust with carefully formulated organic material, and the rock crushers are in short supply. While some whine about the injustice of it all, Bill accepts an invitation to live with his prospective neighbors, a prosperous farmer and his large, hard-working family, to learn the needed skills, while his father signs on as an engineer in the town of Leda. Peggy, unable to adjust to the low pressure atmosphere, has to stay in a bubble in the hospital. When the Lermers are finally reunited on their own homestead, they build their house with a pressurized room for Peggy.

One day, a rare alignment of all of Jupiter&#x27;s major moons causes a devastating moonquake. Peggy is seriously injured when her room suffers an explosive decompression. Furthermore, the machinery that maintains Ganymede&#x27;s &quot;heat trap&quot; fails and the temperature starts dropping rapidly. George quickly realizes what has happened and gets his family to the safety of the town. Others do not grasp their peril soon enough and either stay in their homes or start for town too late; two-thirds of the colonists perish, either from the quake or by freezing. The Lermers consider returning to Earth, but after Peggy dies, they decide to stay and rebuild. The colony gradually recovers.

An expedition sets out to survey more of Ganymede. Bill goes along as the cook. While exploring, he and his friend Hank discover artifacts of an alien civilization, including a working land vehicle that has legs, like a large metal centipede. This proves fortuitous when Bill&#x27;s appendix bursts. Forced to adhere to a schedule, a shuttle picks up the rest of the group and leaves without the missing pair. Hank figures out how to drive the alien vehicle and transports Bill to the next landing site. Bill is then taken to the hospital for a life-saving operation.

Upon awakening from the operation, Bill contemplates a discussion he had with George about his future: whether to return to Earth for school or stay. He sneaks outside and looks up at the sky. When a nurse finds him and scolds him to return where he belongs, he replies, &quot;I am where I belong. And I&#x27;m going to stay!&quot;

==Reception==

Groff Conklin wrote that although &quot;Farmer in the Sky&quot; was &quot;conceived as a novel for &#x27;adolescents&#x27; ... this book is also one of the best of the month&#x27;s output in science fiction for adults ... an adventure story with an unusual amount of realism in its telling. It is &quot;not&quot; childish&quot;. Boucher and McComas named &quot;Farmer&quot; &quot;just about the only &quot;mature&quot; science fiction novel of the year [1950]&quot;, describing it as &quot;a magnificently detailed study of the technological and human problems of interplanetary colonization.&quot; Damon Knight found the novel &quot;a typical Heinlein story ... typically brilliant, thorough and readable.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller recommended the novel unreservedly, saying that Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;minute attention to detail ... has never been more fascinatingly shown.&quot;

Surveying Heinlein&#x27;s juvenile novels, Jack Williamson noted that &quot;Farmer in the Sky&quot; &quot;has harsh realism for a juvenile.&quot; He described it as &quot;a novel of education&quot; where the protagonist &quot;tell[s] his own story in a relaxed conversational style.&quot;

==Major themes==
The book takes up consciously many of the themes of the 19th century American frontier and homesteading - but without the moral stain of dispossessing the Native Americans. In particular, a character who grows the first apple tree on Ganymede and offers seeds to other colonists comes to be known as &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; (and saves his family from freezing by burning his precious tree).

==Scientific details==
The &quot;heat trap&quot;, which allows humans to live on Ganymede, is a man-made implementation of the greenhouse effect, although its mechanism is never explained. This effect could be achieved in reality by releasing large quantities of super greenhouse gases, which would not require a constant power supply, and would therefore be unaffected by a disaster such as that described in the book.

Decades after publication it was discovered that the magnetosphere of Jupiter encloses Ganymede and the other Galilean moons in an analog of Earth&#x27;s Van Allen radiation belt, subjecting their surfaces to an intense rain of ionizing radiation. The Galileo flyby in 1995 discovered that Ganymede has a magnetosphere, but the shielding effect is weak; it is believed that the surface radiation intensity would still be lethal within months.

The alignment of Jupiter&#x27;s four major moons as described in the book can never happen in reality. The three inner Galilean satellites are in a resonance with one another such that whenever two of them are aligned, the third will always be non-aligned and quite often situated on the opposite side of Jupiter.

The book describes Ganymede as having about Earth gravity but in reality it is only about .

Heinlein also postulated that the surface of Ganymede was volcanic rock like the Moon. Subsequent discoveries have shown that Ganymede&#x27;s crust is actually almost 90 percent ice or frost, covering a subsurface ocean.

The novel refers to the &quot;Space Patrol&quot;, the interplanetary peace-keeping organization described in &quot;Space Cadet&quot;.

Because it was originally written to be serialized in the Boy Scout magazine &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, Bill Lermer&#x27;s participation in the Scouts is pervasive, mentioned at least once per chapter.
